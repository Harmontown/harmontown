00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
Hello everybody, welcome to Meltdown.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Harmontown is once again in session.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
You lucky little devils.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Once you welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown,

00:41.000 --> 00:52.000
Dan Harmon.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
Dan Harmon.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Thank you. Where do we start?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Dan, where's your belt?

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
I forgot to wear a belt because I've been off my diet for so long.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
The Easter thing, I don't know, there was some point where Aaron and I

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
slipped off of the wagon and allowed ourselves to just start.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
I've been cheating on my diet quote unquote for multiple days into weeks

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
and this morning I put on a pair of pants and I was like, I don't need a belt.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
That bowl of Cheetos last night was your belt.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Yeah, exactly. Belts are for closers.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
But I forgot that jeans kind of, they expand over time.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
So if I dance too much, these will come right around my ankles.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
We must enforce that then.

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
No, no, no. And your little chicken dance is perfectly designed to me.

01:52.000 --> 02:03.000
Also, my underwear also down around my ass.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
So these guys got an eye load.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Come on, let's bring them down.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Whoa.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
Fuck the queen.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
You mean the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher died?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Did she, you know who else died?

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Aw, you don't give a fuck about Margaret Thatcher.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Aw, no, you should care about Annette Putticello. She died.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Now say aw.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Yeah, Margaret Thatcher booed.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Don't boo a stroke. A stroke is a bummer.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Roger Ebert died.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Hey!

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
A guy who only got more and more awesome as he got older.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
He did, yeah.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
So on one hand it was like Mission Accomplished.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
He really knocked it out of the park in terms of being a guy.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm out of breath from making my pants fall down.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Just milestones. This is a show about milestones.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
That's how I feel about Roger Ebert. We kind of got to watch him die.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
He made no bones about that and kind of made it very enjoyable.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
He owned up to his role as a curmudgeon as he got older and older.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
He became more and more of an expert in what he was talking about.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
He got more and more bored with unremarkability.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
But stayed a civic-minded, progressive, interesting essayist.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
I was constantly reading and filling his brain with stuff and filtering it

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
and giving it out to people who had totally seamlessly adapted his role

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
from a Chicago Sun-Times movie reviewer to an online presence.

03:43.000 --> 03:50.000
He was more facile than most 25-year-olds in terms of being out there and online.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Then he died.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
He kind of wrote a thing saying,

03:54.000 --> 04:02.000
oh, I got cancer in my leg or whatever. I'm going to hang back for a second

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
and I'll see you guys in a couple of days and then he died.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
It's sad. I don't know. It's a bummer.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
It's weird because there's a million people die every day.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Horribly. By machete that are totally undeserving.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Horrible, horrible, unjust deaths happen.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Then it's like, oh, Billy Crystal. We kind of look back on the life of a clown.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
It's kind of dumb because it's like, well, fuck it, he died rich.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Billy Crystal didn't die.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
I think it's just because celebrities spend their lives as an antenna

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
and a frame drawing our attention.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
We get to talk about them.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
If you're a celebrity that's famous for being a slut,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
we get to talk about sluttiness.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
That famous slut, it's like a tarot card, an archetype.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
If you're famous for being funny and you're famous for it,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
and they tell little stories, oh, this guy was famous for being rich

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
and then he's famous for being poor, he's famous for fucking a dog,

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
and they're non-people, they're ghosts.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Then when they die, we go, oh, he died.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
It's kind of weird because we don't go, oh, Lebanon is on fire?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
We don't do that.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
It's like when Patrick Swayze died. That was a bummer.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Oh, man. Holy shit. Good segue, buddy.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
From death to Roadhouse.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Our assigned movie was Roadhouse.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Anybody watch Roadhouse this week?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Well done.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Well, you know my rule, Jeff, from doing a show.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Be nice.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Until...

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
It's time not to be nice.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It's time to be not nice? How do they word that?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
It doesn't come off right. Roadhouse.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Be nice. Until it's time...

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Roadhouse, which I've never seen, is one of the few that's crazy.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
It's weird that it slipped through my cracks,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
but I think the reason it did is the same reason it's so fascinating.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
There's still a couple of beavers, but it's chocolate.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
It's slipping through my cracks.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
Get a hold of yourselves.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I tried to push past it.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
You guys got to help me out.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
The show will be three hours long.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
It's a show that kind of falls between the quantum definitions

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
of a lot of the things that we use to define a movie.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Like, is it a good movie or a bad movie?

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Is it an action movie or a drama?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
It's very odd.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
The only thing you know for sure is it's a vehicle

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
for this debonair young Starlet Patrick...

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
What's his name?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Swayzing.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
He's a star.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Well, I mean, it's a very...

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
His hair says Starlet, but his muscles say star.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
One of the things that's very charming about it is

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
it has this very, very kind of uplifting message to it.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
He's a guy that likes to be nice, as he says.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
It's also, as a 21st century progressive,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
you have to be behind the movie

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
because it's the gayest movie you've ever seen.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
But it's kind of dishonestly gay, I guess,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
because it's sort of saying,

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
this is a very manly movie.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It's not a gay movie at all.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
So is that a crime

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
or is that actually a heroic move?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I don't know.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
It's kind of a motif, like in 80s films,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
like Top Guns, notoriously really fruity.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
And then the manliest stuff back then, I guess.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Yeah, she said like that.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Who's the woman? Kelly?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
What's her name? Kelly Lynch.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Was it Chris McKenna who said last night?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah, she's a vestigial...

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Oh, it was at you.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
She's a vestigial female character.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
She's just there to go through the motions.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
It's always like even the hair and makeup people

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
on the set of the movie were like,

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
well, whatever.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Like, what are we doing here?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Let's talk about Patrick's peach,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Aizad shirt, you know,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
and how tucked in it should be.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
There is a scene when, in Roadhouse,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
if you guys will recall,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
when Patrick Swayze is doing Tai Chi.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I'm sitting in Tai Chi.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
I wanted to talk about this.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
He's certainly doing kattas or whatever,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
and he's there along the riverbank,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
and he's moved in on a...

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
the world's best apartment in a barn.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
It's a beautiful Soho loft in a barn in Kansas,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
so wherever they are.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
And, or Missouri?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Are they Missouri?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Kansas, somewhere outside Kansas.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Kansas City, Missouri?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Kansas City is split.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
That river might be the Mississippi.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Between the barn and Benzara's house

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
might be the Mississippi.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
It's a metaphorical river.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I mean, it's...

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
But I don't know what it's a metaphorical river.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
The river Jordan.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I think it's narrative laziness.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
It's the old man river.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
He goes to buy an apartment,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
and he's driving down the road in his car,

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
and he buys a shitty car

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
because he doesn't want his Benz to get fucked up

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
because he knows his car will get fucked up.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
And he buys a shitty car,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
and there's a wistful drive down a country lane,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
and it's just him going apartment shopping,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
and it goes to a barn,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
and it's this beautiful apartment inside

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
with a great big window,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
which, of course, someone's going to go through

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
because it's a roadhouse.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
There's going to be a fire,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
and every window must get gone through.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
It's fenestration at all times.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
And across the river is Bencazara's mansion,

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
which is hilarious.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
That is the weirdest thing.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
He moves in.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
It's like if Luke Skywalker,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
after Mos Eisley,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
if Hansel is like,

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
well, first thing's first.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Let's find an apartment,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
and they got one across from the Death Star.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I'm like, what's that?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
What's that moon over there?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
That's no moon.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
That's our neighbor.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
You're Death Star adjacent.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
And so he's doing Tai Chi,

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
and he's well-oiled,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
and it's either sunrise or sunset,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
but the lighting is great.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
And then Bencazara goes by on an ATV,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
and he gets a smile like, hmm.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
And who's the club owner

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
that hires Dalton at the beginning?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
I don't know who that actor is,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
but anyone know the actor's name?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
John Locke's dad from Lost.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Wow.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
John Locke's dad from Lost.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
John Locke's dad from Lost.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
The stakes for that guy

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
is simply, can I have muscular men

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
around me at all time?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
He loves Patrick Swayze.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
He even loves some of the bad guys.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
He's still conflicted, and like,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
there's so much gay energy,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
but it's not, it's proudly gay.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Any time a girl gets up on the table

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
and starts taking her shirt off,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
like, hey, get out.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Patrick Swayze only drinks coffee,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
and he just doesn't do drugs,

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
he doesn't drink,

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
and any naked women,

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
he just shakes his head,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
and like...

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
It's bad business.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
But also, I don't think he gets it.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
He's like, naked women, what?

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
What do they think of next?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Okay, but the scene that Jeff's describing,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I wanted to talk about this particularly.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
If we talk about nothing else,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
because you guys are majority of the audience,

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
I want you to watch this movie

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
and get out your little GIF programs.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
I want to see somebody's going to make a GIF

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
of this, an animated GIF

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
of the part of a roadhouse,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
where Patrick Swayze is doing Tai Chi in the morning

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
at the bank of the river

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
that lies between him and the villain.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
And then it cuts to...

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
It's just a lot of coverage

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
of Patrick Swayze doing Tai Chi.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
And then the villain is out drinking

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
like mimosas or something,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
and it's watching him.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
And the expression on his face is just like,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
huh, I'll be done.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
When he's doing Tai Chi,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
he's on the veranda watching him.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
And he's been watching,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
when he's fucking Kelly Lynch,

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
that's when he's on the ATV.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
And he sees them, he pulls up,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
and he's watching them fuck, right?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
The other way around.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Oh, the other way around.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Okay, so Tai Chi, he's on the ATV.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
And when they're fucking, he's on the veranda.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Okay, so the bad guy's doing a drive-by

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
on his four-wheeler,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
and he's watching his nemesis

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
do Tai Chi in his shirt off.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Any time Patrick Swayze takes his shirt off,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
there's a guy regarding him.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Two guys in this case.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Then it cuts to his landlord,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
and it becomes like a he-haw sketch,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
where his landlord is like watching him,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
going, huh, I'll be tired.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
It's so weird and joyful.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
It's got a very joyful energy.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
It reminds me a lot of Xanadu.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
What genre of movie is this?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
All you really know is that someone

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
somewhere along this weird pipeline

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
was having so much fun

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
that it almost didn't get contaminated

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
by the entire movie-making process.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
But of course, story structure,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
character arcs, logic.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
None of that's there,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
but the joy is still in the final cup

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
of what you drink.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
This movie from the outset

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
takes place in a world where

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
bar bouncing is a high-stakes,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
dramatic business

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
with all kinds of codes

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
and countercodes,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
and it's possible to be a sell-out bouncer,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
or a bouncer with integrity.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I guess in that age...

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
But then we find out,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
we find that very subtly and very slowly,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
that the reason why he's all about being nice

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
and playing by the rules is because

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
he ripped a man's throat out.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
He had killed a man by ripping his throat out,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
and then he does it again.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And he almost does it a third time.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And he does the three-finger claw thing,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
and he's going to rip another throat out.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
There's also a dead poet society moment

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
with shotguns.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
It's like, exactly...

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
In the third act,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
there's a moment where it's identical

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
to the end of Dead Poets Society early.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Instead of standing on desks,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
with shotguns.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
And then...

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
It's a weird movie.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
It takes place in a weird world,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
and I more than three times

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
called out in a false set of ways,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I'm going to die!

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Which is a sign of a great movie experience.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
For me, for my money,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I have to start with Sam Mele.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Because Sam Mele gets hair in this.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Sam Mele enters the movie

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
an hour into the movie,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
or 45 minutes in. He comes in late.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
That's when the movie begins.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Is Jason McCarris here?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Jason, can you come up for a second?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Jason is a friend who came to the show tonight,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
and he texted me.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
That's a pretty...

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Pretty hesitant applause.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Jason McCarris, everybody.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Thank you.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Jason is a pedophile,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
and he wants...

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Why did you applaud like that?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
That's one of the first round of applause.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Maybe he's a pedophile, we don't know.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
The...

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
You texted me right before he came to the show.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
You said that for some reason you were on the set of Rogue House.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I was, I was.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I just wanted to mention with the gay through line thing,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
and you were mentioning the claw and ripping out the throat and everything,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
that the guy he's fighting with

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
actually says to him, I used to fuck guys like you in prison.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Yeah, that's the line.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
That's called burying the lead.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Because that line happens almost

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
on the fifth to last page.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I used to fuck

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
guys like you in prison.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
But honestly,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I was like, Patrick Swayze,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
he's a very charming guy,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
but he's not...

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I didn't remember him as being like,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
we didn't go like, oh, that guy,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
he's...

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
I'm not even insinuating that Patrick Swayze,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
the human being,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I don't care if he was in or out of the closet

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
or around it or whatever.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Actors are all crazy, whatever floats their boat.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
They all fuck fish and children or whatever.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
It's an insane job.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
They lie for a living to themselves

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
and to God.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
So the good ones are good and the bad ones are bad

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
and sometimes you find out, oh, he likes to

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
put his dick in a flower.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Who cares?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
But I'm just saying the on-screen icon

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
that is Patrick Swayze, he was...

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
It didn't just take place because dirty dancing

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
came out like right before that.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
And we checked Ghost after we watched this

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
because we were like, is this a thing?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
And I watched Ghost and he was like,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
shot very differently and acting very differently.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
To get into character, he kind of had a sort of

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
sachet to him and like...

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I don't know, maybe that's the director's fault.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I did say I was on the set.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I just moved to California from

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Connecticut and was movie nut.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
And it was the first time I ever saw a set.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
And I've never been on set before.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
And it was the double deuce.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
It was a facade, complete facade.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
It's not real? No!

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I hate to, you know, spoiler alert.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
But from behind,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
it's just like all boards and from the front

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
it really looked like a place.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
And on a Sunday, I was there alone.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
In this glory of being on a movie set

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
and there's a security guard who must have been hired

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
just to stay there 24 hours a day.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Yeah, kid, get out of here!

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And then we came back another night, the whole family.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
My mom, dad, sister and I.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
And we were watching them with the lights and everything.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
And out comes Patrick Swayze.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
And I remember my mother being very disappointed

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
that he didn't look quite like he did on screen.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
He was just hunched when their cameras weren't rolling

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
and he had a limp.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
He had a horrible football injury

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
when he was a kid or something.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
And it just affected him like all through his life.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
And there's a million Swayze children

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
all of whom look vaguely like Patrick Swayze

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and all of whom are in Roadhouse

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
but not prominently on camera

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
lest you go, what the fuck's going on?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Because they all look a lot like Patrick Swayze.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Are they really? Yeah.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I thought we were joking about that.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
No, no, no. Patrick Swayze's got a handful of brothers.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
There's five people in that movie that look like

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
kind of like fetal alcohol syndrome Swayze's.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
The other could be his actual brother

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
who shows up every once in a while and you're like,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
oh wait, that's not Patrick Swayze,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
but looks just very much like him.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
His mom, Patrick Swayze's mom

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
choreographed the

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
production of Sweet Charity that I was in

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
in Simi Valley Community Theater.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
She taught me to dance.

17:25.000 --> 17:39.000
Do you remember any lyrics from one of your songs?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Look, forget I asked.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Forget I asked.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
When did controlling change?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
It became about sabotage.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I thought you were really interesting.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
Commit to it at least.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Thanks for coming up, Jason.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I'll excuse myself.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
So you say you were on the set.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
You just mean you actually like...

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I was there watching them shoot and they came up

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
and were looking for extras and they kind of pointed at my mother

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
and said, hey, come here.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
And she just didn't think it was her,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
so she had her chance to be in the movie and blew it.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Blew it.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Sorry, mom. Where was that shot?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Valencia.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Jason McCarris, ladies and gentlemen.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Thank you.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Roadhouse.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm sorry, Dan.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
I didn't mean to shut you down about that.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
No, it's okay, man.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Just keep the show moving. That's your job.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Just keep me feeling good.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Keep my confidence up.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
That's controlling.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
What about the scene when Sam Elliott

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
starts dancing all night long

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
and they go to a diner?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
He's dancing with Patrick Swayze's date?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Yeah. His girlfriend?

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
And he's got his hand around her neck.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Yeah, he's rampant, cock-blocking.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
An all-out assault.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
He's just whispering in her ear.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
He says things to Patrick, so he's like, boy, I wish

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
if she wasn't fucking you,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I'd try everything I could to get her to fuck me.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
That girl's got

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
entirely too many brains to have an ass like that.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
It's pretty weird that he's a good guy.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
It's odd.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I see from Twitter that

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I think Spencer's drunk tonight.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
What?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Spencer doesn't drink, does he?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Yeah, not usually.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Let's bring Spencer up and see what's going on.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Quickly, before the applause ends.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Spencer, have you been drinking?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
No. Yeah, yeah.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Yes.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I have.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Wait, I thought you were a tea toddler.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Why?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I thought you didn't drink.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I don't.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Did you not?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I did. You did.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Who's on first?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Accurate.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
End of bit.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
We've been through this.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
He chooses not to drink.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
He knows how.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah, exactly.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
It's not like he's incapable of doing it.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Because on the tour bus, on the Harmontown Tour,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
you didn't really drink a whole lot.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I had a shot or two, yeah.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
But mostly it was Diet Coke or Mountain Dews for you.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Yeah, yeah.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I love high-fructose corn syrup.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
What did you have to drink tonight, Spencer?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I had three

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
PBR tall boys,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
courtesy of

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
a pikey.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
The pikey.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Three tall boys.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Is that a lot? No, that's not a lot of beer, right?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Tall boys are 16 s, right?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Yeah, 16.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Something happened up front, right, Erin said she pulled up in a cab.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Oh my God, yeah. Well,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
she should tell it, right?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
She almost died.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
She was kind of funny?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I guess it's kind of funny.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Alright, let's bring Erin out and have her...

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Sorry, I don't mean to sandbag you.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
No, no, it's okay. Erin McGathy, tell the almost died story.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I don't know if I almost died,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
it was just weird. Oh, you almost died.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Spencer, you're drunk.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I took a...

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I took a cab. Look at that smile.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Look at this guy.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I've never seen you smile like this.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I've never been happy.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
See, that's what happened to me,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
but I was like 13.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Yeah, yeah.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I did a lot of things out of order.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah, life is like a bingo card.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Everybody learns different things at different times.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
It's great. Spencer's finally learning that

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
alcohol takes the pain away.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It's good that you didn't learn it as a child.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
You'd be like me.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Did you drive here, Spencer?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
You live quite a ways away. Yeah, yeah, I drove here.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
You'll be sober by the end of the show.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Well, I hope, yeah.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I mean, I haven't done any

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
experimental testing on the subject,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
but I'd assume...

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
God, he's so drunk.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I'm tore up, you guys.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
And it kind of looks like

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
he's going through fake prop folders right now.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Hey, alright, tell this cab story.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
So, speaking of drinking and driving,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I took a cab here,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
as I usually do on Monday nights,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
because we drink during the show and I don't want to drive.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And my cab driver...

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Thanks, guys.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
And my cab driver,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I went through independent taxi,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
which is normally a great company.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I shouldn't say the name of the company, whatever.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
My cab driver

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
wouldn't stop when we got to Sunset and Gardener,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
which is where...

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Yeah.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
He's like, what are you, fucking mainstream?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Stopping for you.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Corporate bitch.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Indy cab company.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
So, he wouldn't stop, and I kept on saying,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
no, no, stop, stop, stop, stop.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
And he kept on going and dropped me off

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
up by the pikey,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
where Spencer was standing.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I was like, oh, my friend's there. Please stop, please stop.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Like, as if that made him stop.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
He was like, well, she has a friend.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I'll stop the cab here.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
No relationships.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
So, he stopped the car

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
and ran across the street.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I showed Spencer my cake,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
and then my cab driver immediately

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
made a U-turn and got T-boned

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
by a car in the intersection.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
And Spencer was like, you couldn't tie.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
No, well, think about it this way.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Oh, stop, stop, stop, no.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
How about you just turn around and take me back?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Yeah, I was funny.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Like, I almost...

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
I was going to have him turn around,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
but I mean, if you wouldn't have been standing there...

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Spencer, your alcoholism saved the day.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
You may have saved my life

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
because I was like, oh, there's Spencer.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I'll walk back with him instead of having that driver

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
pull back around.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
It was pretty weird.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Okay, before we bring up...

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Actually, I want to bring up Camille,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
because maybe he might have something to say about this.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Let's bring out Kumail Nanjiani.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I don't know

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
if Camille has...

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
I don't know.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
I want to talk about Skeletor.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Oh, yeah.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
From the He-Man universe.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I've got opinions.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Skeletor...

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I've...

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I've been researching.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Because I always thought this was the case

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
when I was a kid.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I would watch it as a rerun

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
or whatever, after school.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
It would be like between Inspector Gadget

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
and Morgan Mindy or something like that.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
And I always thought this was the case,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
but as a 40-year-old, I recently looked back into this.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Skeletor from the He-Man universe.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Antagonist.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
The Antagonist, the Darth Vader of the He-Man universe.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
He-Man, for those of you who don't know,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
was the alter ego of...

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Prince Adam.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Of an identical man

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
with a shirt on named Prince Adam.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
Who also had a very idiosyncratic looking.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
They had the same animal also.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
Yeah, I mean, as if having the same head and body...

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Yeah, what could it be?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
He also accompanied the same...

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
There's only one giant green cat

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
in this kingdom.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Yeah, Skeletor was the Darth Vader

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
to this character, this universe,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Eternia, I think was the name of the world.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Yeah, I always...

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Remember, Skeletor

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
lived in a place called Snake Mountain.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
That's correct.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
He was obsessed with beating He-Man.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Yep.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
And He-Man's mentor or, you know...

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
The sorceress.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
His Athena, the sorceress,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
who had eagle hair

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
and a beak head or something.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
And she lived in a place called

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Castle Grayskull.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
That's correct.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
And Skeletor was always going on and on

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
about how he wanted to be

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
in Castle Grayskull.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Which seemed appropriate.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
And I looked it up.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Because Snake Mountain sounds like a terrible place.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Like, don't buy a house at Snake Mountain.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Skeletor used to live

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
in Castle Grayskull

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
according to the mythology of the...

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Wait, he couldn't pay the rent?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
What happened?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
He got, like, evicted.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
He got, like...

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
He got evicted from Castle Grayskull.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
You're saying this is the origin story.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
He didn't get, like, a slip on his door.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
You have to pay the rent, but I can't pay the rent.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
He used to live in Castle Grayskull.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Yeah.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I guess I didn't know that.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Well, speaking of, like...

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
It's his rightful home.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Oh, he used to live there.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
He didn't live there with them. He lived there on his own.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
It was his place.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
It's a skull. It makes sense.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
He lived in a skull.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
He would drive up and he probably left the door unlocked

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
because he figured who would steal this from me.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
This is some Israel-Palestine ship.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Yeah! You said it, not me.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Fuckin' air, right?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I didn't want to say it, you know,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
and have you jump on me.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
No, no, no. I would have agreed.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
This is some shit that blew my mind.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Here's the other thing that blows my mind.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Who used to live in Snake Mountain?

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I mean, there's some Snake guy

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
living in a honeycomb

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
displacing the bee or...

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Buzz-off was his name.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
His name was Buzz-off.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
There was a giant bee person.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
How far down what size hill does this shit roll?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Like, I just...

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Also, the big problem I have with it is...

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Okay, so if there's a whole race of people

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
who are like Skeletor,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
why is his name Skeletor?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Well, I don't know that there's a race of people.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Well, there was one race of all people

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
who had, like, mosquito faces,

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
but you only knew one, and his name was Mosquitoer.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Are all the others just, like, Ed and Jared

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
and stuff like that?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Did you meet all the Mosquito people in the streets?

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
You see them once.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
It's me, and it's all these people,

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
and they all have mosquito faces,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
and he's like, I'm Mosquitoer.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
That's Gerald.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
So, the naming was always...

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
always threw me off, even as a little kid.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Well, there's a people named Manfred.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Like, Man and Fred.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Well, his name is He-Man.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
That's the most redundant name ever.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Yeah.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
He-Man really falls apart if you really look at it.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
It's also... that was one...

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Poor Skeletor.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I was looking, I was browsing around,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
and I saw, like, a Skeletor package

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
that was Skeletor scuba gear.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Like, you could buy a special Skeletor

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
that had, like, a scuba pack.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
And I just thought that was so...

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Like, all those years, like, Skeletor was the good guy.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Like, this guy is, like, he's, like,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
going like, ah, I'm gonna get He-Man.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go through the water

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
and ruin his fishing trip, you know?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
And there was a fish man.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
There was, like, a Merman or something.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I could do that, and he's like, you know what? I got this.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Like, that's a good villain.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
His name was Merman.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
That was a guy named Merman, who lived in the...

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
You're, like, amazing at this.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Thank you. What about... was Ram-Man in there?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Ram-Man was in there. He was a porn star.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I had the Ram-Man toy.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Oh, his legs would go... Yeah, he would, like, go up.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
He was a good guy, right?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Ram-Man was a good guy.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Was it Battle Cat and Cringer?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Cringer was the... Yeah.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
I know everything about He-Man, except for the evictions.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
How old are you?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
I'm 33.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
And you were to...

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Were you almost watched the cartoons?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
I watched the cartoons.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
That was the biggest, like, most, like, disillusioning thing

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
last year. I found a DVD set for, like, $3.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I was like, oh, my God, this cartoon.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
So I watched it, and I was like, oh, I must have been

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
a dumb shit as a kid.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Because it's so bad, that cartoon.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Like, some stuff holds up, but that one...

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
They use the same animation, so...

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Yeah, it's really incomplete.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
He-Man always walks, like, right to left,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
and he, like, bounces up and down,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
and they, like, work that into, like, every episode.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Yeah, well, because it was such expensive-looking animation.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
It looked almost rotoscopes.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
And then he would fight his evil twin,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
and they would just show... they would just flip the image.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Well, what's also funny, he had an evil twin

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
that made a robot cyborg. His name was Fakor.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Fakor, yeah. But worst name ever.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
Who looked just like He-Man, except he was blue with orange hair.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Like, you're not fooling anyone.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
Except in a world where Prince Adam is a Clark Kent.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah, he's like, hey, I mean...

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Maybe everyone in the universe has a weird...

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
They all have that prozopagnosia.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Yeah, exactly.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
He's like, if you're going through the trouble of making

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
a fucking android to replace the main guy,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
make him the same hue as the main guy.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
Even his hair was a different color.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
So many missteps.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
What was, what was Skeletor's mission?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
What did he want to do?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
To get his home back.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
It makes me cry.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Yeah, he wanted his home back.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
He wasn't the villain.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
It was the power of Grayskull, right?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
His home. The power of having a home.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
What he called it is, like, he wanted the power of Grayskull.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
But he just wanted his house back.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
His house back? The power of a home.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Well, he wanted to rule all of Eternia.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Also, which is a little...

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Which I'm like, I wanted to see the series where he wins

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
and he rules Eternia, but then it's just him,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
like, doing paperwork and taxes.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And they're like, this is not as easy.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
So what was He-Man's role in this universe?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Like, he was there to keep Skeletor out of his home?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
He's half human, half Eternian.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
And which...

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
That is beastiality.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Because his mom is Earthling,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
and his dad is Eternian.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
So, which is beastiality.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Which is also what Superman and Lois Lane is.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
That's beastiality.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
What do you mean, beastiality?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
They're different species. Why are they fucking?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Well, different species are beasts.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
No, but that's what...

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
What other two species have sex?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
And we're like, all right, that's fine.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
A giraffe in an otter.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
That's the only example.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
No, but I mean,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
it's a sentient species.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Is it beastiality of a horse

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
fucks like a donkey?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Yes.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Well, actually, a horse is fucking

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
a horse is beastiality.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
As long as one beast is involved.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Exactly.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Wow.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
We've learned a lot.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Do you guys know He-Man?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Yeah.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Yeah.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
It's pretty easy to catch up if you

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
go to a cursory googling.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
There were a whole race of snake people in there.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
And I bet they used to...

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
They used to live in Snake Mountain.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Yeah, because they don't always get along with Skeletor.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
I bet that's what it was.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Shit.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Are you saying Skeletor is like

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
the Palestinians?

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Well, I mean, I'm not saying...

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Ooh.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I'm saying he was

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
displaced from a place he previously

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
occupied.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
I mean, is it politically

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
controversial?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Baby, tell them what you were saying in the car.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Slamming the steering wheel.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
It's just like the Palestinians!

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I mean, I...

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I guess they share that.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I'm saying I feel bad for Skeletor.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Okay, that's what I'm saying.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
He just looks like a bad guy.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
That was his only mistake.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
He's also speaking of gay...

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
He's straight up gay on that show.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Skeletor is a gay man.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Well, I mean, not to be...

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
The way he literally...

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
First of all, dresses like a gay man

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
who's just learned to be gay from the internet

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
or something.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
So does he man, by the way.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
He man is straight up like a fur underwear

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
and leather halter top.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
He's always surrounding himself

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
by boners.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
With boners.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Does he look like...

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
No, no, I'm going to stick with this.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
He looks like a skeleton, right?

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
With a hood?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
He's got his skull for a head, yeah.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
But he's like a skeleton

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
who works out because he's super buff.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
What are his powers? Is he just strong?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
He has a stick that...

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
He has a staff that glows.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Yeah, it's pretty gay.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Are there powers?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Yeah, it's a magic stick.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Also known as a wand.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
It's bigger than a wand. It's a staff.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
He's got a staff.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
You're right.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Yeah, you know he has a scuba equipment?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Yeah, a skeleton.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Strong Spencer.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
They always did that

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
to sell more.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
They would just have more mountain climbing he-man

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
and shit like that.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
They did that with Superman.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Superman used to be able to be in space

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
and then for a while he couldn't

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
so they could sell the Superman space outfit.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
What happened in the last Dungeons & Dragons game?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
You went to the Shadow Plane.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
And we got the Soul of Growth.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Oh yeah, I think you got that episode before though.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
But yeah, you got the Soul of Growth.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Our shadows

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
detached, ran off and

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
a dark... Wait, what?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I wasn't here last week.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
We went... Robin Williams was here.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Fuck you.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
There was no way.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
It feels like this is like a dream you had.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
All my shadow ran away

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
and Robin Williams was there.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
That's true.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
I saw pictures.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
I was very upset.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
So our shadows were detached

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
and we were in a dark

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
shadowy plane

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
where a dark version of Coco

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
the horse came up to us

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
and Erin was riding on...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
What's your name?

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Mulraine was riding on the horse.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Is the horse, was it a shadow?

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Shadow version of Coco.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
But 3D?

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Or is it on the floor?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Did you drunk Spencer tell us?

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Yeah, guys.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Spencer stopped trying to eat the dice

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
for the listeners at home, guys.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
For the listeners at home.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
They're colorful.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
All right, Spencer.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I really hope you sober up tonight.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I think we all... This could be a tragic ending.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
He just kills us off

35:54.000 --> 36:04.000
because he's drunk.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Just then, a mysterious dark sun

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
appeared and animated the shadows

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
of Sharpie, Quark, Mulraine, and Christeberg.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
The shadows newly awakened, freed themselves

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
and danced off towards a thicket

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
of ashy black columns.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Having lost their shadows, the group

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
was considerably weakened

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
and lost, having just been transported

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
to yet another plane.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
But just then, the gang was approached

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
by a large, swift shadowy horsebeast

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
who was in the middle of the night

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
in the middle of the night.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
A large, swift shadowy horsebeast,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
though silent and slightly off,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Mulraine could tell the beast was somehow linked

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
to her companion, Coco,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
who was last seen on the plane of Twyla.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
After mounting the shadow creature

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
and planting a flag of sadness into the ground,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
the gang pressed onward

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
into the stand of ebb and pillars,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
hoping to regain their shadows

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
and find their way.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
But would they truly find what they were looking for

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
in the thicket of ebb and pillars?

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
Drunk Spencer!

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
So I got it.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
God damn it.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
What is the flag of sadness?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I was listening to Harmontown today

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
and at some point before you guys departed,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Sharpie was like,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I saw a blue flag

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
made out of my sadness.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
I said that?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Yeah, yeah.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
It's perfect that it's blue.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
That's a good color for sadness.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
The reason you did it was to mark

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
where you had been in case you, you know,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
got lost or were going in circles.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Oh. It was pretty brilliant.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Alright, so now we're marching off

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
towards the dark columns, right?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Towards the dark columns.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Yeah, so our shadows

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
are gone.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Yeah, are gone. We're going to go regain.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I don't ever use my shadows.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Turns out we took a lot of

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
vitality points, right?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Yeah, that's true. You guys took some ability damage.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
You're weakened

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
and you feel kind of more ill

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
and sickly as it were.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
So I just feel kind of shitty because my shadow had a way.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
In game terms, you have

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
minus one strength and minus four constitution.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
So it's kind of like being hungover.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
It's like being poisoned.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
You'll find out tomorrow.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Alright, so how about

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
drink Gatorade? It's a lie.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
No, it's bacon sandwiches.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
The British...

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Don't drink bacon sandwiches either.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
British scientists people, that's what they're called,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
they commissioned a study

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
that actually linked bacon

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
sandwiches to ending

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
hangovers. And eggs.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
And eggs. But you know fastest

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
hangover cure of all?

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Sailing drip. Medical students

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
give each other...

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
You'd have to be a real loser

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
to have like a sailing drip at your house.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
They're a real professional.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
I just found out they have vans

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
in Las Vegas

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
where you can get in

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
and they hook you up to an IV

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
and you can continue gambling while they IV

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
salient in you.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
And it kills your hangover in like 10 seconds.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Wow. That's bad luck.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
The van is called a wake-up call.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
I said that to somebody

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
in their immediate question was,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
you mean like video gambling, right?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
And I realized for the first time,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
the alternative would be that there's a blackjack dealer in there.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
That was me.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I said that.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Spencer's got him.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I was there, you guys.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
How far off are these columns, Spencer?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
You guys are approaching them.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Soon you'll be inside of this

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
entanglement of columns.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Okay, so we walk up to the entanglement of columns.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Stay with me, guys, I can see.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
The floor is ashen gray

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
and the pitch black columns

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
jut out of the ground into the sky.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
They're gnarled and clawed branches

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
grabbing at the black sky above.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
You can hear an ethereal wind blowing

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
in the air, telling of misery and madness

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
and languages unknown.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I do want to do that.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Fuck.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
So they can't see it, so I'll describe.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
The columns are like intertwined.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
It looks like they're almost grasping at the sky.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Yeah, right.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
So you can, Jeff can kind of see them.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
You can kind of see them, right?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Back me up, bro.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
He's pretty much right.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
It looks like they're grasping at the sky.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I pretend that I can totally see them.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Who the fuck do you think?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Yeah, I know.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Are they grasping? How many fingers are there?

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
What do you mean? They're columns.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
How many columns?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
How many are there?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Sharpies, bluff, falls through.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I guess.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Okay, guess.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Five.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Well, you roll to see if it's...

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
No, I mean, he guessed correctly in terms of convincing.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
All right, you guessed correctly,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
but it was clearly still a guess.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
The way you threw up your hand was...

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
No dice, five.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
No dice for a roll.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
All right, so these columns...

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Can I go examine the columns?

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Yeah, you can.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I'll go examine the columns.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Their surface is smooth and black.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah, that's what they look like.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
They seem rather straight,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
stretching high into the sky.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
And as noted before,

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
they have narrow branches.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Narrow branches, so we can climb these things.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Yeah, definitely.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
You're a big climber, huh?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I love to climb.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I love climbing columns.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
You hear a soft squish.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Squish, squish, squish.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Oh, shit.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Is it approaching us?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Who knows, man?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I cast light.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Yeah, you do.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Your light has an incredibly diminished effect.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You can only see about 10 feet ahead of you.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
You don't make anything out.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Squish, squish, squish.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Oh, god.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Do I have a torch?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Yeah, you do.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I don't think it's going to work.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I think the light shit isn't working.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
But if I...

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I mean, like I said before,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
we're going to attach a torch to an arrow

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
and then shoot it towards the squishes.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
But I guess that's a bad idea.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
It's not a terrible idea.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Don't attack squishes.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I've been living in regret ever since we fought that dragon.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Remember that dragon came out and said,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
mmm, delicious porcelain.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
And you just fucking started firing at it.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
You know what?

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Some dragons will be like, hey, my name is Ralph.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Like, let me hang out with you.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Well, I challenge you to be so good

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
at archery and not attack everything that you see.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
You know, like almost most of the encounters

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
you guys have had so far

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
have actually had non-combat resolutions

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
that were possible.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Well, there's no way we would know that.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Why are you telling us this now?

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Because I guess, I guess that that's the case.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Well, we disagree and consensus is you're wrong.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
All right, okay.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I have a good feeling about that fucking dragon.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I think you're wrong.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
You're good. You were lucky with the five columns,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
but this is too much.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I start climbing up one of the columns.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
I think it's my turn.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
On Coco, I...

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Damn.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
On Coco,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I approach this,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
the noise.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
It says I have low light vision.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
You do. Oh, right, because you're half-elf.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
I think you're a human person.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
You are always forgetting I'm half-elf.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
That's never been said.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I don't see race.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Nice. Cool, dudes.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
All right.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
So, I approach...

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
You don't see anything.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
You can hear the squishing,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
but you can't see a thing.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
In fact, you have the best vision,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
and you can't see anything.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
You can still hear it.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
It sounds maybe like it's going around.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Like a circle?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
You can't tell it's a circle,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
but definitely different places around you.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Uh-oh.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I start climbing up one of the columns

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
as high as I can go.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
You climb it. It feels firm

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
and kind of springy underneath your grasp.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
It's not cold.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Kind of like a cock.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Once you go giant black ethereal column,

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
you never go

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
white giant ethereal column.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Placing your fingers

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
around this stiff, rigid object.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
No.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
You climb up the black pillar,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
and you can actually...

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
They're all black.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
It's all black pillars,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
but you can see there's something pretty far off

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
that looks like it's not black.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
It's like a tuft of color.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
On the top?

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Yeah, on the top of a far-off pillar.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I'm on the wrong pillar,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
but I can see from this column

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
that I can see another one that has a different hue.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Yeah, wrong's all relative, but yeah.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Gotcha.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
In this case, I would say wrong is the right word to use.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
What if it was like a trap?

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Then it would be the right pillar.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Maybe you're one of the four right pillars.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
So how far up am I right now?

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
You're about 30 feet up.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I stay there.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
He conceals his knowledge.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Does he tell us?

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
No, I pass on

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
what I see to everybody else around me.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Can I try and climb up to where the color is?

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Yeah, yeah.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
You're not quite as good as a climber

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
as a quark is, if I'm not mistaken.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Do you have a climb skill on the right

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
bar of your skill chart?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
It says no numbers,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
so that's infinity.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
It doesn't say any numbers?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
No numbers are there,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
so I assume I have all of the climb points.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
It's infinity, yeah.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I climb down

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
and say, you know what, I see another column over there.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
What's up there?

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
You can't see, because you have

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
low light vision, right, not dark vision.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
You can only kind of make out

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
the outline of maybe

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
it looks kind of like a blob.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
It doesn't really look like much.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
But it's a color.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
It's definitely color, and everything's pretty much black and white in this world

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
and gray, so it's kind of

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
contrast.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Why don't you go levitate up toward it?

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I shall.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Why don't you, like in Roadhouse,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
get nipple to nipple with it?

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Squish, squish, squish, squish, squish.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Casting levitate, right?

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
That's happening? Yeah.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
You flow, uh, you slowly slowed up

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
into the air.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Slowly slowed up.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
It's foster brooks.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
It sounds like

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
a slur against some kind of race.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
You go into the

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
you go into the

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
you go into the underground chamber.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
You go into the underground chamber.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
So you're floating up in the air.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
You're a good 20 feet, you know,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
away from the elevation that you need to be at.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
So you continue to ascend.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Squish, squish, squish, squish, squish.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
I use

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I use wild empathy,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
and I ask

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Coco if she knows what that's squishing.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Why would you ask the squish person?

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Oh, they're far away. Or they're not

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
available.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Like you haven't seen them.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Okay, Coco doesn't respond.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
I mentioned in the last session, Shadow Coco

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
can't communicate. Shadow Coco.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Yeah. Once you go Shadow Coco.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
We never go

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Corporal Coco.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Um, as the old saying goes.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Alright, well I

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
what can I do here?

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I feel like I haven't done anything.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
You got traps.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
You have a bow.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
You're aggressive.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
That's true.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
I want to do, hey guys, can we all agree

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
let's have a non-conflict resolution.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Yeah, let's find the non-conflict resolution.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Alright, Shadow.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Let's do this.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Alright, I yell out to the thing.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Have you heard Lady in Red?

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Hold

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Oh

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
What did it say?

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
He said, hold on.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
I'm sorry, what did you say?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I yell. I yell it out at the top of my

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
impressive lungs.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Holdo

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
It's like he's saying holdo.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I yell out

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
You

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
can pass

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
if you want.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
We should have

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
decided what you should yell before you yell that.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
It's an inversion of the classic

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
you shall not pass.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Good to know.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Oh, it's a person who can speak.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
He's talking to us.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Squish person.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Thanks for the notes.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Do you come in peace?

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
I would say

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
so.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I clamber down

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
from the column and I

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
walk out to the middle of

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
the columns

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
and I summon

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
the squishy people to me.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
I'm excited he is.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
The squishy people.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
That also sounds racist.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
The squishy people.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Sharpie is still floating up in the air also.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
You were probably like

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
approaching him so like you'd get to him

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
first before you would get that

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
chronologically unless you want to float down to the ground.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Sorry, I don't get that.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
You're floating in the air.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
You just want to chill?

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I like it.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
You're floating in the air.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
That's what you're doing.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
You're getting close.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
That's what I'm saying.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
You're approaching it.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
You make it out it's actually a person.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
What is the person like?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
This is getting real racist.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
You find a wise and old man sitting

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
up in a tree in very tattered yet

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
shimmering white rags that stand out

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
in stark contrast to the black column

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
he is perched in.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Jesus Christ.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Dear sir.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Go ahead.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Hi, I'm Mulraine.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Sweetie, you're down there.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Yeah, I'm down here. I'm calling up.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Is that okay?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Dear sir,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I'm Mulraine.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
I'm sorry, that's my girlfriend.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
And these are

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
my friends.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
We mean you no harm, obviously.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
What's your story?

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Breffi the Wanderer

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
This is my name.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I've been wandering for all my life.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Never sleeping in the same place twice.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Sweeping in the same place twice?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Twice.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
I say nothing, I just float back down.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I climb up the column

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
to Breffi.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Breffi? Breffi?

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Breffi the Wanderer.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
I climb up.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
I climb up.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I like the sound of this guy.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
So I climb up the column to talk to him.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
How's it going?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I extend a small hand

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
and welcome.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
He takes your small hand.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
What is a small hand?

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
I said...

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Don't you have just the hands you have?

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
I'm small. You can pick hands?

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I'm a small gentleman.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
I'm a gnome.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
He's like a reference to a six-year-old boy.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
He's a little man.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
I didn't know this the entire time.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
In my head,

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
it was just you, but you don't have a tie.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Now...

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Now go back and think of me fucking Coco.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
It's way better.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
That's why you had to stand on the tree stump?

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
It's like fight club for you.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
No, but dude, if I have to fuck a horse at my height,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I have to stand on a tree stump.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Just maybe a less witty one

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
than the one you would have to.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Exactly.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Okay, so I say to him,

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
look, our shadows have been taken from us.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Do you know anything about this?

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
You know, I just saw some shadows wandering down

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
not too long ago.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Yeah.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Listen, I'd love to help you folks,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
but right now we're being surrounded by Phantom Fungus.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Phantom Fungus.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Phantom Fungus!

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
I summon Dalton.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
I didn't hear that. I'm sorry.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
I wish we had a cooler

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
from a notorious roadhouse

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
sparse to come clean up the action.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Yeah, it's time to not be nice.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Do I have any

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
thing I can use here?

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
You have traps.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Can I ask him something

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
and he can ask the guy?

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Hey! Hey!

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Quirk.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Can you hear me? I've got

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
strong pipes from my years of touring.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Could you ask...

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
What's his name? Bruffy?

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I'm Bruffy.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Did he say his name was Bruffy?

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Bruffy the Wanderer.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Could you ask Bruffy if the Phantom Fungus...

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
I mean, they sound like bad guys,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
but are they good guys or bad guys?

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
And is the Phantom also with an F?

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Two questions.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Bruffy, when you say we're being surrounded

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
by Phantom Fungus, is that a threat

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
or are they cool?

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Phantom Funguses are mindless

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Funguses that try to eat people.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Also, they're invisible.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
And impervious to

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
pluralization.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Did you not ask

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
the F question? Is Phantom with an F?

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Or is also Fungus with a P.A.?

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Can you also ask why he's so unaffected?

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Why he's not afraid?

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Are you unafraid because you're standing up on top of the column?

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I feel like Q-wise my

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
question was before.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
If we're going just in terms of...

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I climbed down the column,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
put Christopher on my back

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
and climbed back up so he can have this conversation

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
with Bruffy the One.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Real quick question, Bruffy.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I'm Bruffy!

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Yeah, I heard that.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Now, this seems like it's not

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
really going to count, but is the Phantom

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
with an F?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Or is the Fungus with a P.A.?

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Or is it spelled like you normally would spell it?

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
He looks down to the ground for it,

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
mulling it over.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I can't spell!

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Can you take me back down?

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Yes.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
We have a tradition as a group

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
of attacking everything that wants to be friends

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
with us and having

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
these Keystone cops encounters

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
with everything that's just an animal.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Every time a bear just wants to eat us,

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
we end up changing

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
pants with each other.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Can you carry me up there ever?

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I climbed down

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
and dropped off Christopher and picked up Mulray.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Thanks, bro.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I'll see you on the flip-flop.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
If you'd asked him, is a flip-flop

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
with an F or a P.H.?

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
The first flip is with a P.F.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
and the other one's a P.H.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Like Pfizer.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
And the other one's like fat.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Like a Tuesday fat, Tuesday or person?

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
No, like a P.H. fat.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Like a Tuesday.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
So I put Mulray on my shoulders

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
and I ferry her back up the column

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
to have her ask a question.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
That happens.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Hi.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Why aren't you afraid?

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Well,

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
I'm used to phantom funguses.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
They come around the ebb and thicket quite often.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Can you tell him it should be fun guy,

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
not funguses?

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
I climbed down

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
and I picked up Christopher.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Oh, and I asked Christopher

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
before he goes up, I put a note in his pocket.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
That's my question.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Okay, sorry. How about this?

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I climbed down the column.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I take out a pad of paper

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
and I have everybody write down their question.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
My name's not a question.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
It's just more of a helpful statement.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
As that's happening, Breffi comes down.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Oh, thank God.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Oh, shit, we didn't know you could do that.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Breffi, what's your secret for dealing with these phantom funguses?

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
First of all, that is the correct pluralization.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I didn't want to be shitty

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
in this sort of moment.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
It's fun guy.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
That's me as Christopher

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
and Breffi.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
You should dodge.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
You do dodge.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
You feel something come

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
within inches of your face.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
But, uh,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
I feel something come

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
within inches of my face.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Is this still the black pillar?

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
So I dodged

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I dodged whatever.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
No, no, he dodged, uh,

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Christopher.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
You got it right in your eye.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
That's not so.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
That's not so.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Alright, so he's down here.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
So Breffi, what the fuck?

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
We are being attacked

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
right now!

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
What advice do you have to give us for the phantom fungus?

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
You get hit in the face.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
See?

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I dodged.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
You feel an invisible presence hit you in the face.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
I should have just stayed up on that column.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
That's true.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
You take six damage.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Sharpie, do you have any ideas?

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Uh, yeah, I cast Mage Armor.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
That's a good idea.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
On everybody?

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Nope.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
It only works on him.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
It increases your AC by four.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
That makes you harder to hit.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
All of us?

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Nope, just him.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
It's an investment.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Uh, I take

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
my rope

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
and I

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
tie the end

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
to your feet.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I tie the end like a loop, like a lasso.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
And I

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
get out of the way, everyone!

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
My friends get out of the way.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
And I start whipping it around in the circle.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Wait, do you ever tell us how long the rope is?

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
So that we're out of the

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
radius of it.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
It's 12 feet.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Alright, let's go 13 feet, everyone.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Covered in column cum.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I'll hold my hand.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Careful, everyone.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I'll take care of this.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
I'm going to detect the phantom creatures with my

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
rope tracker.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Why are you looking at me like that?

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
No, I'm watching.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
And I start whipping it

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
around in a circle.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
And everyone thinks

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
I'm doing a good job.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
She's doing great at that.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Is rope tracker a thing?

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
No, it's not.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
The premise is if there was

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
an invisible entity in the way,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
the rope would interact with it.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
So I will know where the phantom

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
fungi are.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
But she doesn't have a thing in her

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
sheet that says rope tracker.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I'm calling it my rope tracker.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Oh, she's calling it.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
That's why I'm laughing.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
You're making up

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
you're like a he-man.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
It's just my rope, I'm naming it.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Like I named Coco.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
You feel your ropes slap against

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
something invisible.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Can I do use

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
rapid shot and fire an arrow?

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
No, don't just fire again.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
We're going to get out of this without fighting it.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
But these are fungi that are going to

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
eat her faces.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Hey, but look at the name.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
They're attacking us.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
They're funguses.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
All right, funguses.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
I

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
take out my poison dagger

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
and I sniff it, which most people

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
don't know gets me slightly high, but also gives

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
me, I can see invisible things.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Yeah, you wish.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
That'd be cool. You can believe

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
that's true. Maybe, can he

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
see where my rope tracker

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
landed? You can all see where it hit.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
So you can see where it hit something.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
I hit right there. Yeah, I did.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
I take out my poison dagger.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
That's where it hit.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
I can't

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
I can't detect sarcasm.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
And I hurl it at

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
the funguses.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
The sarcasm?

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
No. That is not a constructive thing

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
to use.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
He flips it around.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
By poison dagger.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Okay, so you're throwing the poison dagger.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Throw that poison dagger?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Okay.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Whipping back quickly, you strike.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
You fling the poison dagger

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
with great grace and swift

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
misalakrity. They're slightly

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
impressed. Yeah.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
More than slightly. They're fucking

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
impressed. In the place that you think

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
that the phantom fungus must be.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
It does not hit. Fuck.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Can someone go get my dagger?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Spencer, what is weapon

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
focus? Weapon focus

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
makes you

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
better at hitting with the weapon that you have.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Shit, I should have known that.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Can I still detect, even though I'm covered

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
in the fungus? You know where the rope

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
hit, whether or not the creature is still there

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
at this point. I don't think the thing is in your face

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
still. I think it just hit you and moved on, right?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Is Mulrainee still swinging her

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
rope tracker? No, you can only do that

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
once or twice.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
The way the rope tracker works.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Do it until I hit something.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
What are my goggles and my

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
newt seeing? If you're searching

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
around, you can see things better.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Almost kind of like if you're

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
like an investigator with a magnifying glass

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
or something. Would it help with this?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
This is invisible. You don't know that it wouldn't.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
It'll help you see

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
and you can't see this. I put on my goggles

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
of my newt seeing and I take out my far

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
sword and I use my weapon focus

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
and I try to do a far sword attack

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
on the invisible fungus.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Donning the goggles of my newt seeing,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
you can see things minutely in a way

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
that you couldn't before.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
You can notice

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
the hazy, not hazy, you can

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
notice the slight difference between shades

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
of gray where footsteps appear to be

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
being made to the floor.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Swinging your sword

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
in a wide arc, you unfurl a beam.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Not a beam, fuck everything.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
What if I just like walked

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
out the back right now?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Swinging your sword

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
in a wide arc, a burst

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
of far sword energy

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
and watches to where you think

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
the phantom fungus is

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
currently residing.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Currently residing.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Where it files its taxes.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
That's a critical hit, you guys.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Critical hit.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Thank you.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Currently residing.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I attacked it at home.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Your sword says

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
resident of it.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
You hear a great whoosh as your

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
blast of energy blasts through the

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
clearing that you were kind of in.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You hear a flump, flump.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
You see materializing before

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
your eyes two halves of a very

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
disgusting looking phantom fungus lying

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
on the ground slain.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I fucking did it.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Thank God for that rope tracker.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Hey, you know what fun guy hate?

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Funguses.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Dryness, heat,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
light, fireball.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
But he's dead.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Honey, he's dead. Stop, stop, he's dead.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Please, you're just

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
desecrating its corpse now.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I thought there was more than one.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
That was a fun guy, not a fun guy.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
No, it's fungus is.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Like there's multiple fungus is.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Like you're right.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
There's more out there.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
One of them is dead though.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
How many more are there?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I love how you're.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Do you want to borrow my rope tracker?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Do you want to let me cast?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
You use it so well.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
You don't know where to cast it.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Dude, I'm going to aim in the general

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
direction of where it's a big spell

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
with a big effect, a big area of effect.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
It's a fireball.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Don't do it at the one

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
that's already dead.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Can we use the rope tracker to figure out

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
where it is and then use the fire?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
We're all using it.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
It's hot. It's like

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
metrosexual. Remember when we were saying that?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
More than invented rope tracker technology.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Let's use it.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
All right, all right.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I feel I'm eating a little bit of crow here

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
because I made fun of it, but I'll wait for

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
the rope tracker to tell me where to cast

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
my fireball. So when you do the rope tracker,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
we kind of have to like get on our knees, right?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
You don't have to. You're tiny, but

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
it goes up over our heads. Right, right.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And I extend the rope to 25 feet.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
That'll make it a bit harder to control.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
You're

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
really pushing your new invention

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
to its limits, huh?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
You remember the first plane

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
was only airborne for like 40

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
some seconds.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
All right.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I bring

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
it back at 5 feet.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
So like a 15?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
20. Yeah, I forgot what I said

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
last time. Just make him sure.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
20.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
12? 12.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Do 17 feet.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
It was 17.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
It's a nice prime number.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
The rope tracker wasn't designed for this.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
For heavy math.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
This is heavy math, you guys.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
This is what heavy math is.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Simple subtraction.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
All right, I take the rope tracker

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
and I

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
put it above my head.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I feel like it could use

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
a better name also.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
The Adventure Facilitator.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Okay, 17 feet.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I thought I would get a bigger reaction to that.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
It's still the rope tracker.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I whirl it around my head.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I'm going to use clock notations.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Your rope strikes an entity

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
at 4 o'clock.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Fireball, 4 o'clock when I get a chance.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Okay.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Like when you see an attractive girl at a bar.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Are you using the same nomenclature?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I don't...

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
That's what happens at bars.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I've been drunk once.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I've been drunk more than once.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
What's happening?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
4 o'clock.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Okay.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Casting your arms in a magical manner.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
You conjure up a brilliant orb of fire.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Although it's light is slightly

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
muted in the shadow plane.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Ignamious infernum.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Launching the sphere of light

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
where you think the rope tracker

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
identified the phantom fungus.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
It launches.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
It strikes the ground

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
right where you thought it would be

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
and explodes into a huge radius of fire.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
The black columns

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
are consumed in the flames.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
And although it is a bit dim,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
you can see they're starting to light up in fire.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Oops.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
The charred husk of a phantom fungus

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
falls.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Woo!

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Yes!

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Shoot that potion, dagger.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Awesome.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Hey, Breffi.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Oh, yeah, what's Breffi up to?

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Hey, guys.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I'm Breffi.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Uh...

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Jump in any time.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
You lit the forest on fire.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Well, I was pushed to that.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Can't make it on without breaking a few eggs, right, Breffi?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
We're gonna have to leave

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
unless you want to die of suffocation.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Let's leave.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
It's that bad?

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Forest fires will kill you, yeah.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Everyone can jump on Shadow Coco, right?

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Not everyone.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
I'd say you could fit...

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I called Shotgun on Shadow Coco.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Well, I have Shotgun.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
You could fit one person in Quark.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Because Quark is really small.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I get on the back of Coco.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
It's like you feel like you've been there before.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I can only take one of you.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
I can cast Haste.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And move very fast.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Yeah, you can.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I can move...

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I was gonna say I can move silently,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
but that won't make a difference to a fire, right?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
It certainly wouldn't.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I hide from the fire by closing my eyes.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
According to Denial,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
in Backdraft, it's a living thing.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
All right, well, I try and reason with it, then.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
You form some compelling arguments,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
but it's not soaking in.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Is it good to flee these columns?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Or is there more to be gained from these columns?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Was anything ever gained from these columns?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
The guy, Breffi.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Breffi the Wanderer.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I'm Breffi.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
But, I mean, you know,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
if those weren't there, he would have just been standing

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
in roughly the same area, probably.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Okay, so there's nothing to be gained.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Well, Breffi, where should we...

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Where to?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
We should get away from the fire.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Who are you?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Breffi sounds like a character in an old CD-ROM game.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I feel like we should keep him around with us.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Like Oregon Trail?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I'd like to buy three pounds of bacon.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I'd love to Oregon Trail.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Me too, great game.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
So, can I also run with these guys?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Oh, yeah, I'd recommend it.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I do it.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Nice.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
You guys are fleeing the fire.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Can I go and get my dagger?

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I get my dagger and then I run.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
All right, we flee.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Hurriedly fleeing from the fire.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
You find yourself amidst something I'm going to read.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Sweet.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
The fire is far away now,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
but you're still within the thicket of columns.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And as you can see,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
there are woven between the black shadowy trees,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
sticky braid-like nets

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
and meshes of shivering white webbing,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
which stands out in stark contrast

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
to the dull grays and blacks of the plain.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
The webbing envelops the entire forest

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
from this point on,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
blanketing in thick, ropey strands of silk.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
You can see bubble-like pustules on the webby floor,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
ominously pulsing,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
and the path that Breffi has been leading you down

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
is barred by webs and nets

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
strung between the trees.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Be careful now.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
We don't want to disturb any FaZe spiders.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Yeah, no shit.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
What's their name? FaZe spiders?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
FaZe spiders.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Isn't they FaZe?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
FaZe.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Not like FaZe spiders.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Okay, good.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
FaZe spiders sound scarier.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
FaZe spiders.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Or the FaZe spiders.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Guys, I don't want to be a dick, but I don't like Breffi.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I don't know. He helps us.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
What did he help us do?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Can we get rid of Breffi?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
He didn't really help us with the fungus.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Is he an ear shot of this discussion?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Yeah, he is.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Can we whisper?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I take Breffi.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I make a loud sound while you guys discuss it,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
so he can't hear.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I take Breffi in Roadhouse fashion.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Lady in red.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I sing that.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I take Breffi by the collar

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
if he has a collar on, and I pin him up against

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
like a tree.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
His collar is vaguely sticky.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Okay, well, it helps me

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
hold on to him better.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
It definitely does, yeah.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I hold him up against the tree and I go, listen Breffi,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
if you let us into a trap, so help me God,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I'll knee you in the nuts, Sam Elliott style.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Does this

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
look as adorable as I think it looks?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
That's

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
your guys' call.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
You should knee him in the nuts just to be safe.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
All right, I'll good cop this.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Hey, man, why would he...

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
No, Sharpie, stand down!

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Why would he lead us into a trap by telling us

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
to be careful for phase spiders?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
We left the fire

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
and he took us into a phase spider nest.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
No, we just ran from the fire

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
and he's warning us about this.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
We just thought this was elegant white silk.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I mean, should we use

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
the rope tracker?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Well, we know where this stuff is.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I mean, it's a great invention, but I don't think

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
we need it every step of the way.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Is there a way to get around the phase spider area?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I mean, why would we have to walk through this?

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Because you're getting...

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
He's a fireman.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I mean, you could, yeah, you could pick your way away from him.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Can I use...

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Is there a magic beast

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
that I could summon that could kind of

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
guide us through this area?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
You can summon nature's allies,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
but they wouldn't be, like, particularly great

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
at guiding you through because they're from a different plane.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
So... Yeah, silence.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
So I shouldn't do that.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I mean, if you wanted another ally

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
on your team, it would work.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
But if you wanted a guide, it wouldn't work.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Can I use a hat of disguise and look like a phase spider?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Oh, Jesus. No, you can only emulate

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
humanoid creatures with the hat of disguise.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Aren't I from this area?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
You're from the plane of Twila,

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
which is a different dimension than the plane of Shadow,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
but they're related.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
There's a thing we have to go through this.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
You don't have to do anything.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Are there, like,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
is it like an alternate dimension, like a Shadow World?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
So there would be real world counterpart to this area?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Yeah, definitely.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
So I do know the terrain a little bit.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Well, actually, interestingly enough,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
it's different than the plane of Twila

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
that you remember.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
So it's not the same.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It's similar a bit, but it's not the same

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
as the plane you're recognizing.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Guys, there's nothing I can do.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
So I examine the immediate surroundings right in front of us.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
You're, like, there's the path before you,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
but it's covered in webs.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
You'd have to, like, cut down the webs.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I take out my sword.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
That's not a good idea. That's how they found out.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Or you could sneak through them.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
I think that's better.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I use my ability to have my small size

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
and my ability to sneak about.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
You're sneaky, too.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
No, that's one they'll come for.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Light them on fire.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
That didn't work for us like two minutes ago.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Well, I mean...

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Or you could light yourselves on fire.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I'm just throwing out options.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
The reason we're here is because

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
one fireball, like, fucking took out a whole forest.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
I mean, it's kind of like having

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
the U.S. Air Force on our side.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
We could just defoliate this area.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Anybody out there have any advice for us?

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
They're basically like drones.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Yes, somebody was raising their hand.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Oh, you were just stretching.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I think their advice would be to pause it

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
and we should close out the show

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
and address the spider nest

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
next week, right?

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Cliffhanger?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
We've got to pick a movie for next week.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Spiderman's Cliffhanger!

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
APPLAUSE

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Because, I mean, what would happen?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Thank you, Kumail Nanjiani.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
One more time for Camille.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Kumail Nanjiani.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Erin McGathy.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
APPLAUSE

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Hi.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Jesus Christ.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
She just spilled her wine.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
She handed me her character sheet

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
and it was kind of soaked with wine.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
She's...

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I didn't get my suit in it.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
It's a little clumsy.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
I'm supposed to have a baby with you?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
What?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
LAUGHTER

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I like that you say,

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I'm supposed to.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Like, you're an alien and

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
your overlord would say,

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
you must procreate with her.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Sorry, I spilled my wine.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
One day you'll be spilling wine for two.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
LAUGHTER

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Think about that, Dan.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
If you get me pregnant, I won't drink.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Don't negotiate with terrorists.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
LAUGHTER

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
APPLAUSE

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Erin McGathy, everybody.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Always make an exit.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
APPLAUSE

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
It's like a crime scene over here.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
There's fucking red wine everywhere.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Think about it, nine months

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
in which I'll be absolutely

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
incapable of...

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I dare you to get me pregnant.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
LAUGHTER

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I think

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I would like...

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I'm going to be selfish here

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
and use the Harmontown Movie Club

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
as my own personal movie jukebox

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and assign a movie that I would like to watch again

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
and discuss next week.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I think that's fair.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Was the person that suggested

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Roadhouse last week here tonight?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Who is that?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
What's your name?

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Lisette? Thank you very much.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
It was a good chance to see a movie I hadn't seen.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
But

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
there's a movie I have seen

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
that I think everyone should see

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
and that whether or not everyone in this audience has seen it again...

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I think they should see it again.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I brought up

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Zardaz in the green room.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I really want anybody to...

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
By applause, who has not seen Zardaz?

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
By applause.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
So this is important.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
How much do you want to see

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Sean Connery in fur, leggings

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
and diapers?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Here's the...

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
We won't go into too much detail.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
It's a good start.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Start it earlier than you think you should.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Don't start this at 11pm.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Don't go to the bar with your friends

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
and then go like 8 o'clock

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Zardaz my place and smoke and joint.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
This is a...

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Have an espresso.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Break it into two days maybe.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
The last third of the movie

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
goes very 70's.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
The whole thing is insane.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Without spoiling anything

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
the director's commentary

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
that I listened to

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
at the beginning of the movie

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
what's the guy's name? John Borman?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I think...

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
He says something like...

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
If this isn't the quote

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
then it's funnier than this.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
He says like

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Hello, I'm John Borman.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I directed a movie called Zardaz

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
in 19, whatever it is,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
79.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
It took

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
X weeks to shoot.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
The budget was X million dollars

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
and I'll be the first to admit

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
it kind of got away from me.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
It's something like that.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
If that's not

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
what he precisely says

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
then what he says is actually even funnier than that.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And the movie is

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
more so than

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Roadhouse, I mean it's just beyond

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
because the 70's was a completely different time.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Before that

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Shark blew up at the end of Jaws

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
there was a different era in cinema

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
when there was a whole different timeline

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
that might have been where

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
American cinema was just like, it could have been anything.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
We still thought movies were like

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
a thing that you did that was kind of

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
half-art, half-populist

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
pacification. It wasn't like fully just like

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
hey, everything has to have a

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
weird, like in the 70's

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
a movie could just end with

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
the hero going

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
to keep blowing his own brains out or

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
just go to black and just credits

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
would roll and silence. You never knew what the fuck

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
was going to happen at the end of a movie.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Zardaz, you don't know what the fuck is going to happen at the beginning

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
of the movie. I've seen that movie three times

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I don't know what that movie's about.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
It's a little bit, I mean

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
there are elements of it that are

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
that's what's great about it. It's not just a

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
shitty movie that's like

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
my favorite thing about bad movies

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
is not because

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
this is what I didn't like about

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
leprechaun and the hood and stuff

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
and why I won't even bother to watch

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Piranha 3D and stuff like that is like

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
there's a line where

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
the shitty movie is self-aware

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
of its shittiness and it's like, hey

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
you'll watch a shitty movie

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
let's make a shitty movie

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
and my favorite shitty movies

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
are shitty movies that are trying

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
to be Citizen Kane and Zardaz

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
really fits the bill.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Xanadu is another one

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
and I think Roadhouse kind of qualifies

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
it's like, hey, let's blow people's minds with this movie

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Zardaz is like

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
let's watch it and we'll talk about it a little bit

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
it hits on themes of immortality

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I know that. Dan, can we get Lisette

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
up on stage? I want to talk about the ending of

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Roadhouse. Lisette, would you

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
come up on stage with us? Lisette

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Grab a Michael, Lisette

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
You're very familiar with the movie Roadhouse obviously

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Yes I am. Can we talk about the ending

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
of that movie? Yes, what

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
in particular? When the polar bear falls

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
on the fat guy.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Oh yes, the coat of silence

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
sort of. Yeah

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
The fat guy is a bad guy

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
right? Yes he is. And he keeps getting

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
his ass kicked throughout the film. Yes.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
And he keeps coming back for more. Right.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And then he gets

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Patrick Swayze hides behind a water buffalo

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
or a yak at some point

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
and then he's ducking and dodging

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
between Ben Guzara's stuffed animals

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Right. And

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
there's a lot of gay threats

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
and he's going to fuck him in the ass and mount his ass

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
and there's like weird things going on

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
and then the fat guy

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
is running around and then all of a sudden

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Patrick Swayze we presume is pushing

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
a polar bear on wheels toward him

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
and he puts

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
four or five bullets into the polar bear

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
and it falls down on him and it seems

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
to kill him but it just turns

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
out it stuns him right? Right.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
You listen.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
If you want me to do some kind of like analysis

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I want you to tell me what you think

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
the ending of that movie like

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
explain the end of that

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
movie to me. Well towards the end

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
what's his name Mr. Waverly

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Yes. Mr. Waverly

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
is gunned down by the townspeople

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
who he fucked over.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Right. And thrown through a coffee

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
table. Right.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
The last act of defenestration there's so many windows

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
thrown through. The last window

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
is the window to the floor. There's a giant square

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
glass coffee table

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
there's only one piece of plate glass left

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
of this town and you're going through it.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
He's also been shot 11 times.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
It actually seems as if like

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
he did some kind of acrobatics and like jumped

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
backwards. Yeah. That's what it looks like.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
And also they punch a guy his nose is already bloody

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
first. It's so like the nose is already

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
bloody and the fist comes in and it's

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
already the blood. But then the fat guy

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
when everybody they gather up the guns at the

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
end and like we're going to hide the crime

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
it's going to be a coat of silence. Right.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
And then in the background the fat guy

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
who we a moment ago

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
was squashed by a giant

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
appears out of nowhere. Yeah one and a half ton bear

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
polar bear

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
but he's kind of like up he's like he's in the

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
background. He's like he's he's he's

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
still got his gun.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Yeah it's like it's like hey so and so do

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
you know anything no I don't do you know

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
anything no I don't do you know anything

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
no I got hit on by a polar bear

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I got knocked over by a bear

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
and then they cut

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
to him fucking sharp titties again.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Oh can we talk about Kelly Lynch's boob job

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
a little bit to that movie. Wow Kelly

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Lynch right yeah Kelly Lynch.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
There was some complicated. I know

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I know her as the mom from Curly Sue

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
that's all I know right. Wow that was a

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
strange strange set of tits

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
razor sharp razor sharp yeah

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
razor sharp yeah you could you could

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
have put his eyes on and while I like

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
like like like a clear division between

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
them like like like like one one in

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
each armpit perfectly round kind of

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
right how you describe that like

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
like a boob here and a boob there like

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
headlights like like like with a

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
total drill between that versus

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
sand dollar nipples that would have been

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
not attractive. You don't like the sand

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
dollar nipples. I'm not a fando.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
You'd rather have the pointy

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
like angular

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
made it carved out of wood tits

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
those tits

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
those tits were roughly shewn

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I would say they were more

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
aesthetically pleasing I think for

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
cinematic purposes I think yeah.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
What would you say the ideal nipple size

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
diameter would be listen

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
if you had to pick. The diameter

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
diameter is half a radius

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
or double the radius I forget no it's

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
double the radius yeah double the radius

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
sorry math tutor

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I would say I would say

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
no no bigger than

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
two or three centimeters maybe no bigger

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
two or three centimeters yeah okay

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
you went metric on us I love that

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
yeah okay let's go

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
with stuff in our pockets a quarter or a half dollar

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I'd say no bigger than a nickel

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
right depending on

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
how old you are and if we're not

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
we're talking pre or post lactation well isn't

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
it usually dependent on the breast size

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
not necessarily you know your nipple

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
expands actually according to how much milk

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
you lactate and

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
or this is biology speaking

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
why did I have you up here earlier

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
if you had a boob the size of a basketball

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
maybe if you had

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
couldn't your areola be

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
you know bigger

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
not according to a lot of the porn I've seen no

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
we're saying the full areola

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
nipple being the whole areola no bigger than a nipple

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
no no bigger than a nickel

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
nickel yeah a nickel sorry

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
but then again you have to ask yourself

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
if we're talking pre or post lactation

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
and when when how old

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
is the woman

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
I don't know why

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
the question was this but the question we were asking

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
he was asking

think of the two things

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
in rapping at the same time

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000

now stop it don't restart it

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
we blew it

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
we can't end the show that way

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
you've heard of a false start

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
that's a false stop

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
we gotta figure out a different way to end the show

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
why couldn't your pants fall down

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
my pants can fall down

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
but I can't improvise a rap

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
while I'm making my pants fall down

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
what do you want from me

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
like what

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
neither of us get paid to do the show

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
can you focus on the rap

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
just forget about the pants

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
and just focus on the rap

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
but I already did

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
history has taught us

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
that there's only so much rap in me

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
once we get into the 8th, 9th, 10th

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
verse it starts to

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
be kind of

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
uncompelling

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
for them

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
they start to get disappointed

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
and anxious

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
they start looking for the door

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
they get a little upset

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
they start to feel held hostage

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
but this is when things are exciting

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
like in Mr. Toad's Wild Ride

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
it takes you to hell

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
but you know it's gonna end

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
the cart stops and Mr. Toad goes

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
okay well

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
sorry about taking you to hell

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
there's something wrong with one of the tires

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I'm just gonna get up Mr. Toad's Wild

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
toolbox

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
try to figure out what's going on

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
hold on an indefinite number of minutes

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
like you'd be scared

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
you'd feel out of control

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
you wouldn't go on that wild ride

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
take us to hell then because Mr. Toad's Wild Ride

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
we're in hell and I'm saying I'm getting out my toolbox

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
and it's not a good wild ride

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I'm embarrassed

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I want to be a good showman

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
fuck your momma in her ear

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
fuck your momma like salt and pepper

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
fuck your momma

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Thank you everybody, good night!
