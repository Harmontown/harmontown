{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:14.400\nFrom Hollywood, California In the steamy, Cambodian deathfields of the\n\n00:14.400 --> 00:29.320\nwarmth of Meltdown Comics' nerd-melt theater, Harmon Chowd, is now in session.\n\n00:29.320 --> 00:35.880\nThe audience has made an agreement to laugh despite their discomfort, despite bathing\n\n00:35.880 --> 00:39.760\nin the warm humidity of each other's armpits.\n\n00:39.760 --> 00:47.560\nSpeaking of which, let's bring out Spencer Quintzen.\n\n00:47.560 --> 01:04.240\nI have a good idea, let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown and bring this shit to order,\n\n01:04.240 --> 01:06.240\nMr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:06.240 --> 01:30.720\nWe've got a couple of items of official business, we've got some awareness, this segment's\n\n01:30.720 --> 01:39.400\ncalled Boring Awareness Things about our show, Boring, sometimes you gotta say stuff\n\n01:39.400 --> 01:44.360\nabout your show, and if anyone is listening for the first time, they're like, this is\n\n01:44.360 --> 01:50.120\nlike every podcast, the first ten minutes is about a bunch of shit, as if I listen to\n\n01:50.120 --> 01:59.680\nthe podcast every week, but I don't, sorry, but we're one of them tonight, we're doing\n\n01:59.680 --> 02:05.120\nthis Harmon Quest thing, it's for real now, it's been a long time.\n\n02:05.120 --> 02:11.760\nI thought it was a working title, but I think it's too late now to change it.\n\n02:11.760 --> 02:15.480\nIf anyone has any ideas, let us know.\n\n02:15.480 --> 02:18.680\nNo, I don't think we can change the title.\n\n02:18.680 --> 02:23.200\nIs that you admitting that you want to keep that title no matter what, even in the face\n\n02:23.200 --> 02:24.200\nof a better title?\n\n02:24.200 --> 02:32.200\nI would love to have come up with something like pencils and swords, but obviously I didn't,\n\n02:32.200 --> 02:38.240\nI did come up with that, but I was like, well that's dumb, I'm quite happy with Harmon\n\n02:38.240 --> 02:44.360\nQuest, it's an offshoot of Harmontown, and now we go on a quest, I think that makes\n\n02:44.360 --> 02:51.640\nvery linear sense to me, an offshoot of Harmontown, wouldn't you ideally like the thing\n\n02:51.640 --> 02:59.400\nto stand on its own, if I was Kevin Smith, would you want it to be called like Smith,\n\n02:59.400 --> 03:06.080\nSmith, Smithness, Smiths and Sorcery, or would you want a chance to be like, well, Kevin\n\n03:06.080 --> 03:11.480\nSmith's in it, however, I also like Dungeons & Dragons, I don't want to force, it's like\n\n03:11.480 --> 03:19.720\nAppetown, hey, I don't care, you got to drink my Kool-Aid, otherwise you can't even give\n\n03:19.720 --> 03:20.720\nthis show a shot.\n\n03:20.720 --> 03:23.400\nAre you saying it's too late to make that change now?\n\n03:23.400 --> 03:24.400\nYes.\n\n03:24.400 --> 03:27.720\nWhy is it too late, we haven't even shot at it?\n\n03:27.720 --> 03:31.800\nI don't know, because I assume that the larger wheels turn earlier and more slowly.\n\n03:31.800 --> 03:34.040\nThey're not drawing up billboards right now.\n\n03:34.040 --> 03:39.160\nAlright, well I'll make a call on Tuesday, but I better have a list of the types.\n\n03:39.160 --> 03:41.720\nI'm glad we announced the name sucking.\n\n03:41.720 --> 03:42.720\nAlright.\n\n03:42.720 --> 03:49.560\nAre you saying that we should put that flair up in the air for people to give us names\n\n03:49.560 --> 03:50.560\nfor it?\n\n03:50.560 --> 03:55.280\nNo, because then they'll sue us.\n\n03:55.280 --> 03:59.600\nBut the real reason we bring it up is because the tapings, which we're going to do, regardless\n\n03:59.600 --> 04:02.880\nof what it ends up being called, are happening very soon.\n\n04:02.880 --> 04:08.480\nWithin the next couple weeks, September 15th, we start taping for a week, two weeks.\n\n04:08.480 --> 04:10.640\nYeah, like eight days, I think?\n\n04:10.640 --> 04:16.320\nEight days, yeah, it's like a weekish, and there's like five separate tapings that we're\n\n04:16.320 --> 04:21.320\ngoing to need each of which will be yielded out of each of those things.\n\n04:21.320 --> 04:25.120\nYeah, there's five nights with two showings each night, I believe, so you can sign up\n\n04:25.120 --> 04:27.160\nfor any of those ten shows?\n\n04:27.160 --> 04:29.680\nNo, I think you can sign up for any of those five nights.\n\n04:29.680 --> 04:30.960\nOh, and you're there the whole night?\n\n04:30.960 --> 04:36.920\nYou're there for two shows, two episodes worth of taping, which will take a couple hours,\n\n04:36.920 --> 04:41.720\nand we'll move you around in the seats between each episode, so it looks like there's a different\n\n04:41.720 --> 04:48.480\ncrowd every night, and we'll change shirts, but you'll be there for two episodes, which\n\n04:48.480 --> 04:49.480\nI think will be good.\n\n04:49.480 --> 04:55.640\nThat's the way we did the original stuff, and so what I'm going to do, because we don't\n\n04:55.640 --> 04:58.640\nhave the information that you need right now, also I think it would be weird for me to announce\n\n04:58.640 --> 05:03.920\nit right now, because then to the extent that you are an adoring fan, you'd have to spend\n\n05:03.920 --> 05:08.680\nthe next five minutes going like, let me get my foot in that door before it sells out.\n\n05:08.680 --> 05:14.520\nI'm flattering myself, I know, but I want you to just enjoy and not have anxiety about\n\n05:14.520 --> 05:19.320\nlike Black Monday or whatever the hell it's called, Boxing Day or, you know, I don't want\n\n05:19.320 --> 05:22.560\nthis rush for, the cabbage patch doll rush.\n\n05:22.560 --> 05:23.560\nCyber Tuesday.\n\n05:23.560 --> 05:31.280\nSo what I'll do is on Tuesday at noon, noonish, right around noon, so now you're forewarned\n\n05:31.280 --> 05:35.680\nlike right around noon, Tuesday, when we have the information, I'll tweet like a link to\n\n05:35.680 --> 05:42.320\na website where you can rush to reserve seats for the Harmon quest.\n\n05:42.320 --> 05:43.320\nFor the whole audience?\n\n05:43.320 --> 05:45.840\nThat'll be our whole audience, is that rush?\n\n05:45.840 --> 05:49.000\nWell, again, I flatter myself, but I don't think we're going to need more.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:52.400\nIf that would be the way to do it, that'd be awesome, as opposed to just having people\n\n05:52.400 --> 05:54.600\nthat may or may not know exactly what we're doing.\n\n05:54.600 --> 05:57.680\nYeah, no, I don't think we're going to need to go get people out the street, but I do\n\n05:57.680 --> 05:58.680\nthink we're going to...\n\n05:58.680 --> 05:59.680\nDo we know how big the...\n\n05:59.680 --> 06:03.760\nI talked to the guy that's producing it, do we know how big the studio audience is\n\n06:03.760 --> 06:04.760\nyet?\n\n06:04.760 --> 06:05.760\n110 people.\n\n06:05.760 --> 06:06.760\nThat's great.\n\n06:06.760 --> 06:07.760\nYeah.\n\n06:07.760 --> 06:08.760\nYeah.\n\n06:08.760 --> 06:09.760\nWe can do that.\n\n06:09.760 --> 06:10.760\nWe can do that five times.\n\n06:10.760 --> 06:11.760\nOf course we can.\n\n06:11.760 --> 06:12.760\nLook at him.\n\n06:12.760 --> 06:18.200\nBut we're also using one of those services, we're doing it through a service that I'm\n\n06:18.200 --> 06:23.160\nsure will then go, nope, your fans don't like you, now we'll turn this other valve where\n\n06:23.160 --> 06:29.480\ntourists are coming in dressed as lobsters for let's make a deal.\n\n06:29.480 --> 06:32.080\nI couldn't get into the prices right, but I guess I'll watch this guy.\n\n06:32.080 --> 06:36.480\nIt was only the same like two or 300 people that just kept sifting through the whole time\n\n06:36.480 --> 06:37.480\nwearing different shirts.\n\n06:37.480 --> 06:38.480\nThat'd be fine with me.\n\n06:38.480 --> 06:39.480\nYeah, man.\n\n06:39.480 --> 06:42.000\nYeah, no, I have no problem with that.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.120\nPeople can come every show.\n\n06:44.120 --> 06:48.880\nWhat I would like people not to do is just automatically before they figure out that\n\n06:48.880 --> 06:53.760\nthey can make every show reserve a ticket for every show because that's a ticket we\n\n06:53.760 --> 06:54.760\ncan't...\n\n06:54.760 --> 06:57.320\nTry to split the difference between precaution and...\n\n06:57.320 --> 07:00.680\nBecause at the same time, we're going to be like 10% overbooking and all that shit,\n\n07:00.680 --> 07:04.560\nso there's bull shit going both ways, ain't there?\n\n07:04.560 --> 07:05.560\nYeah.\n\n07:05.560 --> 07:08.480\nWe're both going to fuck each other over.\n\n07:08.480 --> 07:12.640\nJust hit every elevator button in the car.\n\n07:12.640 --> 07:16.320\nWhy didn't we make the smart move and do all five tapings at Madison Square Garden?\n\n07:16.320 --> 07:18.040\nNo, we shouldn't.\n\n07:18.040 --> 07:21.360\nAll right, so moving on.\n\n07:21.360 --> 07:28.440\nFestival Supreme, Jack Black's lullapalooza of comedy and music is happening in October.\n\n07:28.440 --> 07:32.840\nHarmontown is doing a show, Jeff isn't going to be able to participate, but we're doing\n\n07:32.840 --> 07:34.760\na Harmontown Festival Supreme.\n\n07:34.760 --> 07:36.260\nDo we have any detail?\n\n07:36.260 --> 07:42.400\nI know we do, but I don't because I don't personally right now.\n\n07:42.400 --> 07:46.200\nDoes anyone have any details about when our show is for Festival Supreme?\n\n07:46.200 --> 07:47.200\nIt's October 10th.\n\n07:47.200 --> 07:48.320\nOh, they haven't given us.\n\n07:48.320 --> 07:49.320\nThey gave Jeff.\n\n07:49.320 --> 07:51.480\nNo, but I think it's October 10th.\n\n07:51.480 --> 07:56.160\nI know that because I think that's the date I found out that I had been booked on a long\n\n07:56.160 --> 07:57.160\ntime ago.\n\n07:57.160 --> 07:58.160\nThat makes sense.\n\n07:58.160 --> 08:00.280\nBut that could be wrong about that, but double check that.\n\n08:00.280 --> 08:02.680\nIt's the 10th, but we don't have the time yet.\n\n08:02.680 --> 08:03.680\nOh, all right.\n\n08:03.680 --> 08:09.760\nWell, I'm out of town no matter what fucking time it is.\n\n08:09.760 --> 08:13.440\nI came down a little hard on Steve on that one.\n\n08:13.440 --> 08:18.000\nI wish we had a big, see one day I want to move the show to like a big sound stage so\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:26.000\nthat we can, oh, oh, Mr. Spielberg.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.360\nThat's nine foot Neil.\n\n08:28.360 --> 08:34.360\nI can't see around his pillar because I'm tall.\n\n08:34.360 --> 08:39.240\nNine foot Neil should meet Tay Brickson.\n\n08:39.240 --> 08:46.240\nThe tallest fan of the show should meet the littlest show promoter.\n\n08:46.240 --> 08:48.240\nYou see me coaxing you back into Tay Brickson.\n\n08:48.240 --> 08:49.240\nIs it Tay or Tay?\n\n08:49.240 --> 08:50.240\nI now I forget.\n\n08:50.240 --> 08:51.240\nTay.\n\n08:51.240 --> 08:52.240\nTay Brickson.\n\n08:52.240 --> 08:57.480\nWell, we do get bigger, more comfortable digs with room to like create a space that would\n\n08:57.480 --> 09:02.240\nlike to put Steve Levy in like a little, a little circular research desk.\n\n09:02.240 --> 09:05.000\nOh, so he's our newsroom back there.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nYeah.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:09.280\nHe can have like a little internet, like, like, like, like the center and then he can\n\n09:09.280 --> 09:14.160\njust like tell me about my calendar and of about like, he can do corrections at the after\n\n09:14.160 --> 09:15.160\nthe show.\n\n09:15.160 --> 09:16.160\nYeah.\n\n09:16.160 --> 09:19.440\nAnd he could be the one to put through tweets from people that are watching live and we'll\n\n09:19.440 --> 09:23.000\nhave him up on a screen and then it's, it's, I got big plans.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:24.000\nThat's a great idea.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:25.000\nIt's going to be fun.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:28.000\nBut then they do what it is.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:29.000\nIt's bullshit.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:30.000\nI don't, well, I don't need you.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:31.000\nYou're, you're an original fan.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:32.000\nI don't need you.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nWho cares?\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:37.000\nThat's how I felt about the fucking pixies.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nLook what they did to me.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nThey broke up twice.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:46.280\nYou just Donald Trump and they had a big laugh about it.\n\n09:46.280 --> 09:47.280\nDeath to the pixie.\n\n09:47.280 --> 09:48.280\nI love you.\n\n09:48.280 --> 09:51.120\nWhy are you selling me this shirt?\n\n09:51.120 --> 09:52.120\nYou're making fun of me.\n\n09:52.120 --> 09:54.400\nIs that your dick or your thumb?\n\n09:54.400 --> 09:57.920\nThat's your thumb.\n\n09:57.920 --> 09:59.280\nYou are a debaser.\n\n09:59.280 --> 10:00.280\nYou really are.\n\n10:00.280 --> 10:05.800\nIt's eight laughs from people with really specific haircuts.\n\n10:05.800 --> 10:06.800\nI'm sure.\n\n10:06.800 --> 10:07.800\nAll right.\n\n10:07.800 --> 10:13.200\nSo, all right, one, well, speaking of music, I want to do one segment before we bring Kumail\n\n10:13.200 --> 10:19.000\nout and then, and then, and then have an open, a potpourri, I call it a, I call it a, a, a,\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:20.000\na Kumail.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nA Kumail.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nA Kumail bag.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:26.520\nA Kumail, a Kumail, a Kumail, a Kumail bag is not a bag.\n\n10:26.520 --> 10:28.360\nWell, that implies correspondence though.\n\n10:28.360 --> 10:29.360\nYeah, it's like.\n\n10:29.360 --> 10:33.200\nI said to him, he texted me that he was going to make the show and I said, cool exclamation\n\n10:33.200 --> 10:37.680\npoint and then two spaces and then parentheses, male.\n\n10:37.680 --> 10:41.640\nAnd then he, he wrote back an hour later, uh, how about you've got, I don't understand\n\n10:41.640 --> 10:44.240\nthat, that doesn't sound anything like my name and it's spelled differently.\n\n10:44.240 --> 10:46.920\nWhat about you've got Kumail?\n\n10:46.920 --> 10:47.920\nNo.\n\n10:47.920 --> 10:48.920\nOkay.\n\n10:48.920 --> 10:49.920\nThat doesn't.\n\n10:49.920 --> 10:50.920\nWell, we'll get to that in a second.\n\n10:50.920 --> 10:54.640\nBut first, I'm going to be, I'm going to think of a 90 worse versions of that.\n\n10:54.640 --> 10:59.000\nHere's a segment I call Dan nitpicks, uh, song lyrics.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:04.880\nI like to listen to music and stuff that's it.\n\n11:04.880 --> 11:07.280\nIt takes a lyrics.\n\n11:07.280 --> 11:09.280\nIt takes a lyrics.\n\n11:09.280 --> 11:12.120\nIt's picking the lyrics.\n\n11:12.120 --> 11:18.080\nIf these were the lyrics to a song, I'd say they were repetitive.\n\n11:18.080 --> 11:23.200\nSee, I'm not, I'm not immune.\n\n11:23.200 --> 11:24.760\nI don't, I don't give myself a pass.\n\n11:24.760 --> 11:31.440\nSo, uh, this is where I hold the other musicians to the fire, including their feet.\n\n11:31.440 --> 11:36.880\nUm, yeah, I mean, I frequently nitpick on lyrics, but I think you and I have both set\n\n11:36.880 --> 11:43.720\naround, uh, a drink and, and talked about, you know, Billy Joel's tonic, tonic and gin.\n\n11:43.720 --> 11:44.720\nCome on.\n\n11:44.720 --> 11:45.720\nYeah.\n\n11:45.720 --> 11:46.720\nYeah.\n\n11:46.720 --> 11:47.720\nThat's the thing.\n\n11:47.720 --> 11:49.880\nWhen you're chasing a rhyme, you know, you don't have to rhyme like, like anyways.\n\n11:49.880 --> 11:50.880\nSo, yeah.\n\n11:50.880 --> 11:51.880\nAll right.\n\n11:51.880 --> 11:52.880\nSo here's this song.\n\n11:52.880 --> 11:53.880\nIt's called highway.\n\n11:53.880 --> 11:57.680\nThe highway man by the highway men, the highway men, the super group, the country Western\n\n11:57.680 --> 11:58.680\nsuper group.\n\n11:58.680 --> 11:59.680\nWaylon Jennings.\n\n11:59.680 --> 12:00.680\nKris Kristofferson.\n\n12:00.680 --> 12:01.680\nWaylon Jennings.\n\n12:01.680 --> 12:02.680\nKris Kristofferson.\n\n12:02.680 --> 12:17.080\nIt's, it's Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson and a, uh, uh, and Willie\n\n12:17.080 --> 12:18.080\nNelson.\n\n12:18.080 --> 12:23.280\nUm, uh, the, the, uh, Kris Kristofferson, I think I, I'm going to guess if he's the\n\n12:23.280 --> 12:24.280\none who's taking the verse.\n\n12:24.280 --> 12:25.280\nI think he is.\n\n12:25.280 --> 12:26.600\nCause I think I can recognize everyone else's voice.\n\n12:26.600 --> 12:28.360\nI think he showed up to this song pretty drunk.\n\n12:28.360 --> 12:29.360\nIs that right?\n\n12:29.360 --> 12:31.680\nWho goes Johnny Cash goes to space, right?\n\n12:31.680 --> 12:32.680\nYeah.\n\n12:32.680 --> 12:33.680\nYeah.\n\n12:33.680 --> 12:34.680\nSo, okay.\n\n12:34.680 --> 12:35.680\nSo this, this song is called the highway man.\n\n12:35.680 --> 12:39.680\nIt's a country Western super group and they each take a verse and, uh, this is the frustrating\n\n12:39.680 --> 12:44.680\nthing about, about these lyrics is how in, I get on board and I'll, I'll walk you through\n\n12:44.680 --> 12:45.680\nme getting on board.\n\n12:45.680 --> 12:50.200\nIt's Willie Nelson starts and says, I was a highway man along the coach roads.\n\n12:50.200 --> 12:54.880\nI did ride with sword and pistol by my side.\n\n12:54.880 --> 12:55.880\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n12:55.880 --> 12:56.880\nThat's good.\n\n12:56.880 --> 13:01.880\nHe's often running at that point.\n\n13:01.880 --> 13:02.880\nYeah.\n\n13:02.880 --> 13:09.840\nOh, I'll keep it down if you like.\n\n13:09.840 --> 13:13.640\nYou're on your own for the rest of this highway man.\n\n13:13.640 --> 13:19.600\nMany a young maid lost her baubles to my trade code, but it's good.\n\n13:19.600 --> 13:22.920\nMany a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.\n\n13:22.920 --> 13:23.920\nCool.\n\n13:23.920 --> 13:26.840\nThe bastard's hug me in the spring of 25.\n\n13:26.840 --> 13:31.840\nI don't know what century you're talking about that 1925 is the way we started hanging\n\n13:31.840 --> 13:33.680\nthe people that ran around the highway with swords.\n\n13:33.680 --> 13:36.120\nI feel like I'm going to, I'm going to go 17 or 18.\n\n13:36.120 --> 13:37.120\nYeah.\n\n13:37.120 --> 13:39.640\nI think it was just like, but he had to rhyme, but I am still alive.\n\n13:39.640 --> 13:40.640\nOkay.\n\n13:40.640 --> 13:41.640\nSo fine.\n\n13:41.640 --> 13:42.640\nGood.\n\n13:42.640 --> 13:47.960\nI'm on board cause it sounds like it's about a ghost of a highway man or a timeless figure,\n\n13:47.960 --> 13:49.960\nthe character that lives through time.\n\n13:49.960 --> 13:52.440\nWell, you're, you're way ahead of everything.\n\n13:52.440 --> 13:54.000\nIt sounds like a ghost from that.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:58.120\nIt doesn't sound like a timeless character who lives through everything.\n\n13:58.120 --> 13:59.120\nFor me, it does.\n\n13:59.120 --> 14:00.120\nCause I've read literature.\n\n14:00.120 --> 14:01.120\nNo.\n\n14:01.120 --> 14:05.760\nIt's one, it's one verse of a song I lived in that I was killed in 25, but I'm still\n\n14:05.760 --> 14:06.760\nalive.\n\n14:06.760 --> 14:07.760\nThat's a ghost.\n\n14:07.760 --> 14:08.760\nHe's got unfinished business.\n\n14:08.760 --> 14:09.760\nThat's all it is.\n\n14:09.760 --> 14:10.760\nIt's just a ghost.\n\n14:10.760 --> 14:11.760\nA ghost doesn't say I'm still alive.\n\n14:11.760 --> 14:12.760\nA ghost says I'm not alive.\n\n14:12.760 --> 14:13.760\nI'm a ghost.\n\n14:13.760 --> 14:14.760\nWoo.\n\n14:14.760 --> 14:19.320\nNo, that's, that's a ghost out of cereal box.\n\n14:19.320 --> 14:21.520\nI'm a ghost and I love blueberries.\n\n14:21.520 --> 14:22.520\nAll right.\n\n14:22.520 --> 14:26.280\nLook, I've heard this song 19 million times, I might, I might be ahead of the curve on\n\n14:26.280 --> 14:27.280\nthis song.\n\n14:27.280 --> 14:29.280\nI'm sorry.\n\n14:29.280 --> 14:34.320\nIf ghosts say I'm a ghost, woo, a ghost with Patrick Swayze would have been a terrible,\n\n14:34.320 --> 14:35.320\nterrible movie.\n\n14:35.320 --> 14:40.640\nHe would have woken up after getting shot and he would have gone, I'm a ghost, woo.\n\n14:40.640 --> 14:41.640\nAnd then he never would have, wouldn't it?\n\n14:41.640 --> 14:43.920\nBut then the ghost and poltergeist said, I'm alive still.\n\n14:43.920 --> 14:44.920\nI'm a regular person.\n\n14:44.920 --> 14:47.760\nThey knew that they knew what they were fucking getting away with.\n\n14:47.760 --> 14:48.760\nAll right.\n\n14:48.760 --> 14:49.760\nSecond verse.\n\n14:49.760 --> 14:52.400\nThe ghost officer comes in, when you listen to the song, you'll hear he's a little, he's\n\n14:52.400 --> 14:54.240\nin his cups, as Jeffy would say.\n\n14:54.240 --> 14:56.120\nHe's a little drunk.\n\n14:56.120 --> 14:57.920\nI was a sailor.\n\n14:57.920 --> 15:04.960\nI was born upon the tide with the sea I did abide.\n\n15:04.960 --> 15:09.120\nI sailed a scooter around the Horn in Mexico.\n\n15:09.120 --> 15:13.360\nI went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow.\n\n15:13.360 --> 15:14.360\nChunky.\n\n15:14.360 --> 15:15.360\nIn a blow?\n\n15:15.360 --> 15:16.360\nIn a blow?\n\n15:16.360 --> 15:17.360\nI don't, I don't, yeah.\n\n15:17.360 --> 15:22.960\nAnd when the yards broke off, they said, I got killed, but I am living still.\n\n15:22.960 --> 15:23.960\nOkay.\n\n15:23.960 --> 15:29.360\nSo now, as Jeff spoiled, we're talking about a timeless figure here.\n\n15:29.360 --> 15:35.760\nOh, or is it a series of ghosts stepping forward and saying, here's what I was doing.\n\n15:35.760 --> 15:42.000\nA tip of my, my cap, my sailor cap and then the ghost synonymous.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.400\nAnd then so I'm assuming this is where you and Jenny comes in.\n\n15:45.400 --> 15:49.680\nI was a dam builder across the river, deep and wide.\n\n15:49.680 --> 15:56.440\nWhere steel and water did collide, a place called Boulder on the wild Colorado.\n\n15:56.440 --> 16:00.440\nI slipped and fell into the wet concrete below.\n\n16:00.440 --> 16:06.080\nThey buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound, but I am still around.\n\n16:06.080 --> 16:11.560\nI'll always be around and around and around and around.\n\n16:11.560 --> 16:12.560\nThey all come in.\n\n16:12.560 --> 16:13.560\nOkay.\n\n16:13.560 --> 16:14.560\nSo I'm like, this is great.\n\n16:14.560 --> 16:15.560\nI love this.\n\n16:15.560 --> 16:21.000\nAnd then, and then Johnny Cash comes in and goes, I fly a starship.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.800\nThis was the seven, the late seventies, early eighties.\n\n16:23.800 --> 16:28.800\nIf you didn't have a spaceship and a quarter of your shit, you were off the air.\n\n16:28.800 --> 16:30.800\nSo take it easy on them.\n\n16:30.800 --> 16:35.440\nBut it's, it's, it's like one of them comes in with a guitar that kind of sounds like\n\n16:35.440 --> 16:36.440\na laser.\n\n16:36.440 --> 16:42.080\nWithout ruining what you want to get through here, can I stop and can I freeze frame the\n\n16:42.080 --> 16:43.880\nfirst time you heard this recently?\n\n16:43.880 --> 16:44.880\nOr is that a while back?\n\n16:44.880 --> 16:47.720\nI heard this a while back, but I just, but I like the song that I've heard.\n\n16:47.720 --> 16:51.840\nI was listening to it again recently and then my problem lyric is coming up right at the\n\n16:51.840 --> 16:52.840\nend.\n\n16:52.840 --> 16:53.840\nRight.\n\n16:53.840 --> 16:56.040\nSo at the point, the first time I heard this song, I was, I heard the song a bunch of times\n\n16:56.040 --> 16:59.080\nand never really paid attention to the lyrics as you often do.\n\n16:59.080 --> 17:00.400\nLike you hear a song a million times ago.\n\n17:00.400 --> 17:03.000\nOh, I never knew what that song was actually saying.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:06.280\nAnd this one, the first time I realized that Johnny Cash goes to space, that, that moment\n\n17:06.280 --> 17:07.920\nwas, was, was, was awesome.\n\n17:07.920 --> 17:08.920\nYeah.\n\n17:08.920 --> 17:12.160\nThen this is like, this is before a cloud Atlas, by the way, this song.\n\n17:12.160 --> 17:14.280\nI was Tom Hanks.\n\n17:14.280 --> 17:23.760\nI was a caveman after the war with Holly Berry in my door, a future rich lady with cures\n\n17:23.760 --> 17:25.880\nto my disease.\n\n17:25.880 --> 17:32.400\nI talked her into easing my sick son's disease.\n\n17:32.400 --> 17:38.400\nAnd when she explained to me that the human race was a joke, I was still Tom Hanks.\n\n17:38.400 --> 17:47.000\nRight, always be Tom Hanks and a Hanks and a Hanks and a Hanks and a Hanks and a Hanks.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nAll right.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:53.360\nSo anyways, I fly a starship across the universe divide.\n\n17:53.360 --> 18:01.840\nAnd when I reach the other side, I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can.\n\n18:01.840 --> 18:04.640\nPerhaps I may become a highway man again.\n\n18:04.640 --> 18:06.640\nOh, shit.\n\n18:06.640 --> 18:07.640\nAwesome.\n\n18:07.640 --> 18:11.760\nThis is the peak of, I'm like, holy shit, he stitched it all together, he is the same\n\n18:11.760 --> 18:12.760\nguy.\n\n18:12.760 --> 18:19.320\nHe's in a starship, he's thinking about being a fucking highway man.\n\n18:19.320 --> 18:32.000\nOr I may simply be a single drop of rain.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:37.360\nBut I will remain, oh, oh, oh, pick a team.\n\n18:37.360 --> 18:44.000\nI'll be back again and again and again and again.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:48.200\nI mean, they weave this macho, like, like, like, like cloud atlas of these guys, like\n\n18:48.200 --> 18:49.200\none guy.\n\n18:49.200 --> 18:53.600\nWhat's the difference between a damn builder and a highway man and a spin and a future\n\n18:53.600 --> 18:59.440\ntruck driver in space, like we're all, we're all old white men, like, like, like.\n\n18:59.440 --> 19:02.280\nAnd there's something, there's a spiritual connection that unites us all.\n\n19:02.280 --> 19:06.800\nBut it's like, but I may be a drop of rain, well, me too.\n\n19:06.800 --> 19:10.960\nHey, but a drop of rain, who wants to be a drop of, that's dumb.\n\n19:10.960 --> 19:12.440\nA drop of, I may be.\n\n19:12.440 --> 19:16.640\nActually, at Christmas, I've never, I've never noticed that lyric, that is a very disappointing\n\n19:16.640 --> 19:17.640\nlyric.\n\n19:17.640 --> 19:21.200\nHe ruined it, because why is the guy in the starship going, going like, what, who's he\n\n19:21.200 --> 19:22.200\ntalking to?\n\n19:22.200 --> 19:27.680\nLike, he's going like, I fly a starship, look out for that asteroid, you know, I got this\n\n19:27.680 --> 19:33.280\nweird feeling, I was a highway man in a past life, so when I die, I'll probably come back\n\n19:33.280 --> 19:38.960\nas a highway man, but fuck it, you know, I may, it may be just general Buddhist shit.\n\n19:38.960 --> 19:46.000\nI mean, the space man is the most, because you're seeing stars and fucking planets and\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nshit.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:51.280\nIf you're ever a drop of rain, it's when you're flying through space.\n\n19:51.280 --> 19:54.760\nOr is he saying that, no, there's no rain in space.\n\n19:54.760 --> 20:02.000\nNo, but I mean, he's like, he's, he's, I mean, he's only a drop of rain, he's so minuscule\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:05.240\nin, even in comparison to the whole of rain.\n\n20:05.240 --> 20:09.600\nOkay, yeah, you're saying how infinitesimally small is my existence.\n\n20:09.600 --> 20:17.320\nHe's a soul, he's like a cycle of souls in a cycle of, of a rain of souls.\n\n20:17.320 --> 20:24.560\nThat keeps going, like it's like the water, you know, like, it's kind of cool.\n\n20:24.560 --> 20:30.280\nHe's also saying that, like, I may come back again, and yeah, exactly, if I come back again\n\n20:30.280 --> 20:33.800\nand I keep doing this, like, it will either be as one of these, one of these, one of these\n\n20:33.800 --> 20:36.360\npeople, a human being, or, or a drop of water.\n\n20:36.360 --> 20:38.360\nWell, I don't know, it's like metaphorical.\n\n20:38.360 --> 20:43.560\nIt's like, the soul cycle is like rain, and he's like, just part of all of these souls\n\n20:43.560 --> 20:47.400\nin these internal cycles talking about how they used to be highwaymen.\n\n20:47.400 --> 20:51.280\nBut if he's going to use a metaphor, then the whole song should be called drops of rain.\n\n20:51.280 --> 20:56.520\nAnd then it should be like, one drop of rain I was, was called a highwayman.\n\n20:56.520 --> 21:00.040\nHere's another example of a kind of rain I was.\n\n21:00.040 --> 21:04.720\nI was a drop of rain named Ralph from Colorado.\n\n21:04.720 --> 21:10.560\nI slipped ironically on real rain and fell below.\n\n21:10.560 --> 21:17.400\nThese are all lives, and there is pointless as the rain, but each drop will remain until\n\n21:17.400 --> 21:22.680\nit evaporates again and again and again.\n\n21:22.680 --> 21:31.440\nBut he does say, I go across the universe divide, and when I get to the other side,\n\n21:31.440 --> 21:37.960\nthat implies like when he's dead, right, when he, when I actually go to whatever the afterlife\n\n21:37.960 --> 21:46.000\nfor a possibly a cyclic, like a karmic traveler goes to, maybe I find out, maybe I'm nothing,\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:49.360\nmaybe that was all pointless, maybe, maybe I'm just one of these stars in this endless\n\n21:49.360 --> 21:51.600\nspace that we look at, like Spencer said.\n\n21:51.600 --> 21:53.880\nI think it's cool.\n\n21:53.880 --> 21:57.560\nI thought it was dumb until it got resolved where he'd still remain, and it'll be like,\n\n21:57.560 --> 21:58.560\noh, it's a metaphor.\n\n21:58.560 --> 22:04.360\nI don't like when people say rain and rhyme again and again, because firstly it was highwaymen\n\n22:04.360 --> 22:05.360\nand again.\n\n22:05.360 --> 22:07.360\nThey said again, like we say again.\n\n22:07.360 --> 22:10.520\nYou didn't get to change a game.\n\n22:10.520 --> 22:13.320\nYeah, I like that all the guys are there.\n\n22:13.320 --> 22:14.320\nIt's a human song.\n\n22:14.320 --> 22:16.640\nIt's not a song about the fucking cosmology.\n\n22:16.640 --> 22:23.760\nIt's about, it's about four different like little shapes of loner.\n\n22:23.760 --> 22:31.320\nIt's like, just because you're born in a time when a man with integrity didn't even have\n\n22:31.320 --> 22:35.640\nthe option of being a cattle rustler or a highwayman, doesn't mean that while you're\n\n22:35.640 --> 22:40.880\nwelding a rivet on a dam, when you're built, something is silly, it's like, I'm not a cowboy.\n\n22:40.880 --> 22:45.400\nI'm not a spaceman when I'm welding this dam, but it's like, it's four different guys going\n\n22:45.400 --> 22:52.080\nlike, I was a country western archetype, and then I died, but I didn't die because they're\n\n22:52.080 --> 22:53.080\nall me.\n\n22:53.080 --> 22:54.080\nWell, connect it.\n\n22:54.080 --> 22:58.720\nIt's important to me that that guy be like a guy with, you know, it's a guy.\n\n22:58.720 --> 23:03.680\nIt's about a guy's relationship with the cosmos, not about mapping the cosmos itself and going\n\n23:03.680 --> 23:09.400\nlike, you see those ants down there, one of those ants could be me, and the green's a\n\n23:09.400 --> 23:12.680\nsand upon the beach.\n\n23:12.680 --> 23:13.680\nWhy not that?\n\n23:13.680 --> 23:14.680\nWhy isn't that?\n\n23:14.680 --> 23:15.680\nThat's not a song.\n\n23:15.680 --> 23:18.280\nThat's like something you'd hear in an incense store.\n\n23:18.280 --> 23:21.200\nThat's not something you'd listen to when you're drinking a glass of scotch, and you're\n\n23:21.200 --> 23:24.680\nlike, yeah, my dad was a fucking spaceman, and I'm going to...\n\n23:24.680 --> 23:29.400\nSorry, are you upset that this song isn't country enough for you, that it goes into the hippie\n\n23:29.400 --> 23:32.040\ncosmological, metaphysical at the very end?\n\n23:32.040 --> 23:34.360\nI don't like going from...\n\n23:34.360 --> 23:38.360\nWhen I get to the other side, which is like, Tolkien asks, like, the elves going across,\n\n23:38.360 --> 23:40.600\nthere's like, I'm a person, and I have a...\n\n23:40.600 --> 23:42.600\nI thought you didn't like Tolkien, I thought.\n\n23:42.600 --> 23:43.600\nI don't like Tolkien.\n\n23:43.600 --> 23:44.600\nI don't like those elves, man.\n\n23:44.600 --> 23:45.600\nThat's enough.\n\n23:45.600 --> 23:49.680\nHow do you just turn off your mortality by going on a fucking boat?\n\n23:49.680 --> 23:52.360\nWhat the shit is that?\n\n23:52.360 --> 23:53.360\nThanks, Steve.\n\n23:53.360 --> 23:57.760\nWell, now what we're finding out is you'd like it if as they got right off the shore,\n\n23:57.760 --> 23:59.560\nthey all turned into rain.\n\n23:59.560 --> 24:00.760\nWell, I'm just...\n\n24:00.760 --> 24:05.160\nIf I was observing my life over millennia cycling, and cycling, and cycling, I might\n\n24:05.160 --> 24:09.640\nhave the thought that shit, maybe millions of other people are doing the same thing,\n\n24:09.640 --> 24:14.200\nand that's also kind of interesting, but only worth a passing mention.\n\n24:14.200 --> 24:19.200\nI will agree, Dan, that I don't think that the song Highwaymen succeeds in doing what\n\n24:19.200 --> 24:21.800\nit tries to...\n\n24:21.800 --> 24:26.040\nIt fumbles on the goal line a little bit, of the goal line they're trying to cross.\n\n24:26.040 --> 24:30.400\nIt's like, this is a giant metaphysical thing going on.\n\n24:30.400 --> 24:35.960\nI get what they're going for, but it doesn't quite succeed in either way.\n\n24:35.960 --> 24:36.960\nThat's been...\n\n24:36.960 --> 24:46.320\nHighwaymen lyrics, you've been nitpicked.\n\n24:46.320 --> 24:54.560\nIt's a good song, though.\n\n24:54.560 --> 25:04.440\nHello, hello.\n\n25:04.440 --> 25:06.560\nIs Alan Woo coming, or what?\n\n25:06.560 --> 25:09.560\nAlan Wu is actually directing Harmon Quest.\n\n25:09.560 --> 25:11.560\nOh, and he's not here.\n\n25:11.560 --> 25:13.560\nPeople at home who aren't watching video,\n\n25:13.560 --> 25:16.560\nthere's a seat very ostentatiously reserved in the front row\n\n25:16.560 --> 25:19.560\nthat says, reserved Alan Wu on it.\n\n25:19.560 --> 25:21.560\nYeah, it's like that.\n\n25:21.560 --> 25:23.560\nThe only empty seat here, and it's the one guy here\n\n25:23.560 --> 25:25.560\nthat's directing Harmon Quest.\n\n25:25.560 --> 25:27.560\nMaybe he's running around the back of this house\n\n25:27.560 --> 25:30.560\nholding up his fingers like the camera frame thing.\n\n25:30.560 --> 25:32.560\nLike he's, you know...\n\n25:32.560 --> 25:34.560\nDan, can I say something?\n\n25:34.560 --> 25:36.560\nYeah, you can do on that song.\n\n25:36.560 --> 25:38.560\nThese guys are, you guys are working too hard\n\n25:38.560 --> 25:40.560\nto make sense of something.\n\n25:40.560 --> 25:42.560\nIt makes sense.\n\n25:42.560 --> 25:45.560\nCan I say, I wrote down this quote you said, Spencer.\n\n25:45.560 --> 25:48.560\nFirst off, Camille, I didn't say it made sense.\n\n25:48.560 --> 25:51.560\nI've come down to the side, I get where they're going.\n\n25:51.560 --> 25:53.560\nI don't think they nail it.\n\n25:53.560 --> 25:55.560\nAnd I think Dan's right in saying,\n\n25:55.560 --> 25:57.560\nif they just stuck to a song about,\n\n25:57.560 --> 25:59.560\nthere's the archetype of the loner\n\n25:59.560 --> 26:01.560\nthat goes on through time,\n\n26:01.560 --> 26:04.560\nand that will always be as we go on through the cosmos.\n\n26:04.560 --> 26:07.560\nI think they could have done either or and made it better.\n\n26:07.560 --> 26:08.560\nWell, I think it's...\n\n26:08.560 --> 26:10.560\nWell, this is what Spencer said.\n\n26:10.560 --> 26:11.560\nWhat did I say?\n\n26:11.560 --> 26:13.560\nSpencer said, if you're ever a drop of rain,\n\n26:13.560 --> 26:15.560\nit's when you're flying through space\n\n26:15.560 --> 26:17.560\nand everyone here nodded like, yeah,\n\n26:17.560 --> 26:20.560\nthat's true, Spencer.\n\n26:20.560 --> 26:23.560\nI think it's funny that it's Johnny Cash's,\n\n26:23.560 --> 26:26.560\nthey all clearly wrote their own verses,\n\n26:26.560 --> 26:28.560\nand they're like, I'm going to be a damn builder.\n\n26:28.560 --> 26:30.560\nI'm going to be a boatman.\n\n26:30.560 --> 26:33.560\nJohnny Cash is like, I'm going to drive a spaceship.\n\n26:33.560 --> 26:35.560\nI'm not sure about that.\n\n26:35.560 --> 26:38.560\nIf I had my guess, this is totally a guess,\n\n26:38.560 --> 26:40.560\nand we will verify this later on.\n\n26:40.560 --> 26:41.560\nI'll look it up later.\n\n26:41.560 --> 26:44.560\nMy guess is that Kristofferson wrote the whole thing.\n\n26:44.560 --> 26:46.560\nOr one other person wrote the whole thing.\n\n26:46.560 --> 26:48.560\nIt seems to me so different that,\n\n26:48.560 --> 26:50.560\nbecause he's the biggest star, Johnny Cash.\n\n26:50.560 --> 26:52.560\nI bet that at a meeting where they're like,\n\n26:52.560 --> 26:54.560\nwell, we've got to have Johnny Cash.\n\n26:54.560 --> 26:56.560\nIf he's going to be a spaceman, we'll put him at the end.\n\n26:56.560 --> 26:58.560\nHopefully people will stop paying attention to the lyrics by then.\n\n26:58.560 --> 27:01.560\nWe're all collaborators through so much of their careers.\n\n27:01.560 --> 27:03.560\nYeah, and I will also interject there\n\n27:03.560 --> 27:05.560\nthat at this particular point in time,\n\n27:05.560 --> 27:08.560\nthat Willie Nelson could have been the big gun.\n\n27:08.560 --> 27:11.560\nIt depends from year to year.\n\n27:11.560 --> 27:14.560\nJohnny Cash went through a heavy period of time where,\n\n27:14.560 --> 27:17.560\nit's like the way we thought about Roy Orbison\n\n27:17.560 --> 27:19.560\nand when the Traveling Wool Bears have,\n\n27:19.560 --> 27:21.560\nit's like, well, there's Roy Orbison.\n\n27:21.560 --> 27:24.560\nBut then Johnny Cash got co-opted by hipsters.\n\n27:24.560 --> 27:26.560\nHe's like the hipster.\n\n27:26.560 --> 27:28.560\nThat was recently.\n\n27:28.560 --> 27:30.560\nGod damn it.\n\n27:30.560 --> 27:32.560\nThe fucking damn it.\n\n27:32.560 --> 27:34.560\nRaindrop.\n\n27:34.560 --> 27:38.560\nOh, the rhyme scheme is actually pretty sophisticated.\n\n27:38.560 --> 27:41.560\nSo it's like, I don't know if you gave them each a verse.\n\n27:41.560 --> 27:43.560\nI don't know.\n\n27:43.560 --> 27:47.560\nIt's weird. The sailor one is kind of fucking mouthful.\n\n27:47.560 --> 27:50.560\nI heard the furlum furlum furlum.\n\n27:50.560 --> 27:52.560\nI heard the furlum furlum.\n\n27:52.560 --> 27:54.560\nThat sounds like Kris Kristofferson.\n\n27:54.560 --> 27:56.560\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n27:56.560 --> 27:58.560\nI don't know if it was like an emcee thing\n\n27:58.560 --> 28:00.560\nwhere they came in with it written on their hand\n\n28:00.560 --> 28:02.560\nand they're like, I was a plumber.\n\n28:02.560 --> 28:05.560\nAnd it was like, fuck, this is supposed to be an epic song.\n\n28:05.560 --> 28:08.560\nI plunged the shit out of the crap.\n\n28:08.560 --> 28:10.560\nThe shit out of the crap.\n\n28:10.560 --> 28:13.560\nI sorted it upon my lap.\n\n28:13.560 --> 28:17.560\nI found the peanuts, distinguished turds from diarrhea.\n\n28:17.560 --> 28:20.560\nAnd then they were like, well, we got to put someone in a spaceship\n\n28:20.560 --> 28:22.560\nto balance this out.\n\n28:22.560 --> 28:25.560\nI do remember probably in my teens or 20s\n\n28:25.560 --> 28:28.560\nbeing disappointed when they changed again to a gain.\n\n28:28.560 --> 28:31.560\nAnd I hate when songs make it a gain.\n\n28:31.560 --> 28:33.560\nThat's dumb.\n\n28:33.560 --> 28:35.560\nYeah.\n\n28:35.560 --> 28:37.560\nOr when they backward sing.\n\n28:37.560 --> 28:39.560\nWe talked about too, when they do Yoda speak,\n\n28:39.560 --> 28:41.560\njust to make the rhyme.\n\n28:41.560 --> 28:43.560\nOh, that's the worst.\n\n28:43.560 --> 28:46.560\nWhat's a good example of that when somebody's like...\n\n28:46.560 --> 28:51.560\nAnd my love you will have...\n\n28:51.560 --> 28:53.560\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n28:53.560 --> 28:55.560\nTonic and gin.\n\n28:55.560 --> 28:57.560\nTonic and gin.\n\n28:57.560 --> 28:59.560\nMy love you will have.\n\n28:59.560 --> 29:03.560\nAll right, so we watched Nightmare on Elm Street 2 this weekend.\n\n29:03.560 --> 29:05.560\nAnd one.\n\n29:05.560 --> 29:07.560\nWe watched one because of Wes Craven passing\n\n29:07.560 --> 29:09.560\nand we thought we'd honor him again.\n\n29:09.560 --> 29:11.560\nAnd again.\n\n29:11.560 --> 29:13.560\nAnd again.\n\n29:13.560 --> 29:16.560\nI want to beat that lyric before I move on.\n\n29:16.560 --> 29:23.560\nMy belt is buckled with the topaz of my pain.\n\n29:23.560 --> 29:25.560\nI don't know.\n\n29:25.560 --> 29:27.560\nYou got to bring it back to a country western thing\n\n29:27.560 --> 29:29.560\nlike a belt buckle or a beer bottle or something.\n\n29:29.560 --> 29:31.560\nI love the topaz of my pain.\n\n29:31.560 --> 29:33.560\nTopaz of my pain.\n\n29:33.560 --> 29:35.560\nOr not topaz. What's the other thing?\n\n29:35.560 --> 29:37.560\nNo, no, no. Turquoise, turquoise.\n\n29:37.560 --> 29:40.560\nMy belt is buckled with the turquoise of my pain.\n\n29:40.560 --> 29:42.560\nBut I'll be back.\n\n29:42.560 --> 29:44.560\nNo, that would be dumb.\n\n29:44.560 --> 29:48.560\nI don't think Johnny Cash ever said the word turquoise in his life.\n\n29:48.560 --> 29:50.560\nOkay.\n\n29:50.560 --> 29:52.560\nNightmare on Elm Street, we watched it.\n\n29:52.560 --> 29:55.560\nSo then we thought, let's just watch Nightmare on Elm Street 2\n\n29:55.560 --> 29:57.560\nbecause we kept talking about what we were watching.\n\n29:57.560 --> 30:02.560\nCamille was there and Schrab and Emily and Agee.\n\n30:02.560 --> 30:04.560\nAnd holy cats.\n\n30:04.560 --> 30:06.560\nNightmare on Elm Street 2.\n\n30:06.560 --> 30:08.560\nIt's super gay.\n\n30:08.560 --> 30:13.560\nThere's no fear of that sounding like a homophobic or inaccurate statement.\n\n30:13.560 --> 30:16.560\nIt is one of the gayest movies that's ever been made.\n\n30:16.560 --> 30:18.560\nIt's gay as fuck.\n\n30:18.560 --> 30:20.560\nAnd it's kind of beautifully gay.\n\n30:20.560 --> 30:22.560\nIt's not even that pornographically gay.\n\n30:22.560 --> 30:28.560\nThere is some prurient, externalized gay things about it.\n\n30:28.560 --> 30:31.560\nThere's a lot of people taking their shirts off and doing push-ups together.\n\n30:31.560 --> 30:37.560\nBut the thing that really makes it gay is the gay love, the relationship.\n\n30:37.560 --> 30:38.560\nThe two guys.\n\n30:38.560 --> 30:41.560\nAnd there's a part where they're both fighting and one guy pulls his pants down\n\n30:41.560 --> 30:44.560\nand the fight continues with just one guy's butt out.\n\n30:44.560 --> 30:45.560\nYeah.\n\n30:45.560 --> 30:47.560\nThere's a lot of that kind of stuff.\n\n30:47.560 --> 30:48.560\nWell, it's the equivalent.\n\n30:48.560 --> 30:52.560\nToday it would be looked at as totally progressive because there's a girl in the movie\n\n30:52.560 --> 30:58.560\nbut there's not an inch of skin outside her arms or collarbone exposed.\n\n30:58.560 --> 31:00.560\nShe's just sort of like a regular person.\n\n31:00.560 --> 31:02.560\nAnd she doesn't get in any pillow fights or have any friends.\n\n31:02.560 --> 31:06.560\nBut the guys have friends that pull each other's pants down and roll around\n\n31:06.560 --> 31:08.560\nand they're all hunky and stuff.\n\n31:08.560 --> 31:10.560\nIs it never acknowledged that they speak about this?\n\n31:10.560 --> 31:11.560\nJust really talk about it.\n\n31:11.560 --> 31:14.560\nIt's just from like an alternate universe where like men are objectified.\n\n31:14.560 --> 31:19.560\nWell, what they do keep talking about is how one of them...\n\n31:19.560 --> 31:22.560\nA lonely clap in the back of the room.\n\n31:22.560 --> 31:27.560\nWhat they do keep talking about because that's the one where Freddie is inside the kid\n\n31:27.560 --> 31:31.560\nand so the whole movie is about a kid.\n\n31:31.560 --> 31:35.560\nIt's about a kid going to be misunderstood by people and going like,\n\n31:35.560 --> 31:37.560\nI don't know who I am.\n\n31:37.560 --> 31:41.560\nAnd according to Schrab, the writer actually in an interview said,\n\n31:41.560 --> 31:49.560\nyes, I was thinking of this as a metaphor for being young and figuring out that you're gay.\n\n31:49.560 --> 31:54.560\nBut he didn't expect the director to then take it and then double down on it.\n\n31:54.560 --> 31:56.560\nThe writers often have...\n\n31:56.560 --> 31:59.560\nMy original writing mentor, when I was writing Monster House,\n\n31:59.560 --> 32:02.560\none of the first pieces of advice he gave me is he said,\n\n32:02.560 --> 32:04.560\nand I don't know if this is...\n\n32:04.560 --> 32:08.560\nMaybe I'm betraying this? Am I going to be like Bruce Lee teaching people kung fu?\n\n32:08.560 --> 32:11.560\nAnd now, yeah, because now everybody knows kung fu.\n\n32:18.560 --> 32:20.560\nThat's why they never wanted it to get out.\n\n32:20.560 --> 32:23.560\nYeah. Oh, fuck.\n\n32:23.560 --> 32:27.560\nYou got fucking Jackie Chan running around.\n\n32:27.560 --> 32:29.560\nHe said every...\n\n32:29.560 --> 32:31.560\nScreenwriters always have a secret.\n\n32:31.560 --> 32:33.560\nThey have a secret about the movie.\n\n32:33.560 --> 32:36.560\nYou try to be transparent in all your work,\n\n32:36.560 --> 32:41.560\nlike get your own head on paper and be really clear about things and passionate.\n\n32:41.560 --> 32:43.560\nBut then there's one little exception to that,\n\n32:43.560 --> 32:46.560\nwhich is the writer should know something that nobody else knows.\n\n32:46.560 --> 32:50.560\nLike the basketball in Monster House is DJ's puberty.\n\n32:50.560 --> 32:54.560\nIt's just boyhood bouncing over to the house or something like that.\n\n32:54.560 --> 32:57.560\nI think that was me phoning in, like his advice,\n\n32:57.560 --> 33:01.560\nokay, it's his puberty, I'll keep that a secret.\n\n33:01.560 --> 33:04.560\nBut so anyways, that writer was like...\n\n33:04.560 --> 33:07.560\nThat actually makes a lot of sense.\n\n33:07.560 --> 33:11.560\nYeah, it goes in and it's him becoming a grown-up\n\n33:11.560 --> 33:15.560\nand having to deal with grown-up shit like a fucking monster house.\n\n33:15.560 --> 33:17.560\nIt's true. Well done.\n\n33:17.560 --> 33:22.560\nLike a mortgage, when your property is who you are.\n\n33:22.560 --> 33:25.560\nAs opposed to being a kid's trick or treat,\n\n33:25.560 --> 33:28.560\nthey go and they take what they want from the grown-ups.\n\n33:28.560 --> 33:33.560\nLike they're communists and parents are capitalists and the basketball is...\n\n33:33.560 --> 33:35.560\nSo he's going from communism to capitalism.\n\n33:35.560 --> 33:37.560\nWhich is going from boyhood to adulthood.\n\n33:37.560 --> 33:38.560\nYeah.\n\n33:38.560 --> 33:39.560\nWow.\n\n33:39.560 --> 33:42.560\nBecause communism is not viable.\n\n33:42.560 --> 33:46.560\nThat should have been the tagline for the movie.\n\n33:46.560 --> 33:47.560\nCommunism is not viable.\n\n33:47.560 --> 33:49.560\nCommunism is not viable.\n\n33:49.560 --> 33:51.560\nMonster house.\n\n33:51.560 --> 33:52.560\nWhat?\n\n33:52.560 --> 33:56.560\nWho's this for?\n\n33:56.560 --> 33:58.560\nThe bourgeoisie is the monster.\n\n33:58.560 --> 33:59.560\nAll right.\n\n33:59.560 --> 34:00.560\nSo yeah.\n\n34:00.560 --> 34:05.560\nWell, because one of the most interesting things is that on Friday the 13th,\n\n34:05.560 --> 34:07.560\nNightmare on Elm Street part one,\n\n34:07.560 --> 34:11.560\nthe girl is a typical kind of scream queen.\n\n34:11.560 --> 34:14.560\nShe's being stalked by this Freddie guy.\n\n34:14.560 --> 34:17.560\nShe goes to Johnny Depp and she says,\n\n34:17.560 --> 34:21.560\nI have this idea, like watch me sleep and then wake me up\n\n34:21.560 --> 34:22.560\nand I'm going to try to grab Freddie.\n\n34:22.560 --> 34:24.560\nThat whole thing is played out in this movie as well.\n\n34:24.560 --> 34:26.560\nBut he goes to the guy's house.\n\n34:26.560 --> 34:30.560\nThe guy crawls in the window of another hunky guy's bedroom\n\n34:30.560 --> 34:33.560\nand wakes him up and he's wearing this midriff shirt.\n\n34:33.560 --> 34:36.560\nHe's like, what's going on, Taylor?\n\n34:36.560 --> 34:38.560\nAnd it's like, listen, I really need to talk to you.\n\n34:38.560 --> 34:40.560\nBut the girl is in the movie.\n\n34:40.560 --> 34:43.560\nThat's not who he takes his problems to.\n\n34:43.560 --> 34:46.560\nAnd he tells him, I want you to wake me up.\n\n34:46.560 --> 34:49.560\nIt's a total rom-com because they start out enemies\n\n34:49.560 --> 34:51.560\nand then they become really close.\n\n34:51.560 --> 34:52.560\nYeah.\n\n34:52.560 --> 34:54.560\nThat's great.\n\n34:54.560 --> 34:55.560\nI love them.\n\n34:55.560 --> 34:57.560\nAnd they're not constantly calling each other fag\n\n34:57.560 --> 34:58.560\nor anything like that.\n\n34:58.560 --> 35:00.560\nThere was a lot of stuff in the 80s where it was like,\n\n35:00.560 --> 35:03.560\noh, you're like guys bullying each other for being,\n\n35:03.560 --> 35:06.560\nlike calling each other homo while they beat them up.\n\n35:06.560 --> 35:08.560\nBut then in that same scene, it's like,\n\n35:08.560 --> 35:11.560\noh, the water is glistening off of my pecs.\n\n35:11.560 --> 35:14.560\nAnd that's what you expect from the 80s.\n\n35:14.560 --> 35:17.560\nBut this was more of just a gay love story.\n\n35:17.560 --> 35:19.560\nAnd it was kind of on the sleeve,\n\n35:19.560 --> 35:22.560\non the rolled up fluorescent sleeve.\n\n35:22.560 --> 35:24.560\nBecause we were talking through it,\n\n35:24.560 --> 35:27.560\nbut there's nothing really homophobic that happens in it.\n\n35:27.560 --> 35:28.560\nI just said that.\n\n35:28.560 --> 35:29.560\nMoving on.\n\n35:29.560 --> 35:30.560\nRight.\n\n35:30.560 --> 35:34.560\nI feel like this is from your leftover high women aggression\n\n35:34.560 --> 35:36.560\nthat's being taken out of me now.\n\n35:36.560 --> 35:38.560\nI don't think I was ever aggressive about high women.\n\n35:38.560 --> 35:42.560\nI felt that we found some common ground on high women.\n\n35:42.560 --> 35:46.560\nI feel like you're bringing some sort of weird\n\n35:46.560 --> 35:49.560\nnon-street three rage on me right now that I don't,\n\n35:49.560 --> 35:50.560\nI don't understand.\n\n35:50.560 --> 35:52.560\nMy burn on street three is a really good one.\n\n35:52.560 --> 35:54.560\nThat's where their dream warriors,\n\n35:54.560 --> 35:56.560\nand they each have a dream power.\n\n35:56.560 --> 35:58.560\nSee, the only thing I know about,\n\n35:58.560 --> 36:00.560\nI've never seen anything movies,\n\n36:00.560 --> 36:03.560\nthe only thing I know about those movies is that Don Dawkins\n\n36:03.560 --> 36:05.560\ndid the soundtrack for it.\n\n36:05.560 --> 36:07.560\nIt was all Dawkins songs, right?\n\n36:07.560 --> 36:09.560\nI don't know who that is.\n\n36:09.560 --> 36:11.560\nHe was a rock and roller.\n\n36:11.560 --> 36:14.560\nYeah, well also do yourself a favor and load up the fat boys,\n\n36:14.560 --> 36:16.560\nthe fat boys are running around the house.\n\n36:16.560 --> 36:17.560\nAnd we talked about this,\n\n36:17.560 --> 36:19.560\nour favorite part is that they're being chased by Freddie,\n\n36:19.560 --> 36:22.560\nbut they're still fine time for donuts in the video.\n\n36:22.560 --> 36:24.560\nOh yeah, they're like, oh my god, there's food.\n\n36:24.560 --> 36:26.560\nBut then Freddie is rapping a lot.\n\n36:26.560 --> 36:28.560\nHe's not like just the bridge in the rap.\n\n36:28.560 --> 36:29.560\nHe like starts the rap.\n\n36:29.560 --> 36:32.560\nHe's like, my name is Freddie Krueger,\n\n36:32.560 --> 36:33.560\nand I'm here to say.\n\n36:33.560 --> 36:35.560\nBut he really says that.\n\n36:35.560 --> 36:36.560\nIs that the Will Smith one?\n\n36:36.560 --> 36:38.560\nBecause he also did a thing with Will Smith.\n\n36:38.560 --> 36:40.560\nWill Smith has one, but Freddie's not in that one.\n\n36:40.560 --> 36:42.560\nIt's just Will Smith talking about Freddie.\n\n36:42.560 --> 36:43.560\nOh, he doesn't have like a bridge?\n\n36:43.560 --> 36:45.560\nI don't think Freddie shows up in the Will Smith one.\n\n36:45.560 --> 36:46.560\nOh, okay.\n\n36:46.560 --> 36:48.560\nBut he does say my name is Freddie Krueger,\n\n36:48.560 --> 36:50.560\nand I'm here to say, like in the fat boys one.\n\n36:50.560 --> 36:51.560\nIs he really?\n\n36:51.560 --> 36:52.560\nYeah, he really does.\n\n36:52.560 --> 36:53.560\nYou I Will Slay.\n\n36:53.560 --> 36:54.560\nYeah, you I Will Slay.\n\n36:54.560 --> 36:55.560\nYoda talk.\n\n36:55.560 --> 36:57.560\nForce that rhyme, Freddie.\n\n36:57.560 --> 36:59.560\nAll right.\n\n36:59.560 --> 37:02.560\nIt's like Bobby Brown's rap and Ghostbusters too.\n\n37:02.560 --> 37:05.560\nMy man Vigo, the master of evil.\n\n37:05.560 --> 37:08.560\nVigo and evil now.\n\n37:08.560 --> 37:10.560\nThat's like again and again.\n\n37:10.560 --> 37:14.560\nI like when they you have like raps at the end and like recap the whole movie.\n\n37:14.560 --> 37:15.560\nYeah.\n\n37:15.560 --> 37:16.560\nI'm all for that.\n\n37:16.560 --> 37:17.560\nYeah.\n\n37:17.560 --> 37:18.560\nNinja Turtles has that.\n\n37:18.560 --> 37:20.560\nYou're like, who's because I just saw the movie.\n\n37:20.560 --> 37:22.560\nYou don't need to recap it.\n\n37:22.560 --> 37:24.560\nIs it for people who come in at the credits?\n\n37:24.560 --> 37:25.560\nLike what did I miss?\n\n37:25.560 --> 37:26.560\nOh, okay.\n\n37:26.560 --> 37:27.560\nYeah.\n\n37:27.560 --> 37:29.560\nBut nowadays like the Disney and Pixar movies,\n\n37:29.560 --> 37:31.560\nthey have all those little Easter eggs for the credits.\n\n37:31.560 --> 37:33.560\nI would be very happy if there was a rap at the end of every movie.\n\n37:33.560 --> 37:34.560\nYeah.\n\n37:34.560 --> 37:35.560\nNo, I loved it too.\n\n37:35.560 --> 37:37.560\nI always feel bad for the rapper.\n\n37:37.560 --> 37:41.560\nLike I feel like like it wasn't his idea to like rap about ghostbusting.\n\n37:41.560 --> 37:43.560\nLike I just feel like he's like in front of the microphone,\n\n37:43.560 --> 37:47.560\nlike like seeing the ghost of his dad like shaking his head.\n\n37:47.560 --> 37:48.560\nCause he's like.\n\n37:48.560 --> 37:50.560\nCause his dad wanted it to be.\n\n37:50.560 --> 37:52.560\nWhen Spock came in with the lasers.\n\n37:52.560 --> 37:54.560\nYo, that wasn't Tazers.\n\n37:54.560 --> 37:58.560\nI'm like a Mac Daddy, but you know, I got the lasers.\n\n37:58.560 --> 38:02.560\nAnd then he looks over at his dad's like.\n\n38:02.560 --> 38:03.560\nWhat about the-\n\n38:03.560 --> 38:06.560\nBoy, you used to rap about selling cocaine.\n\n38:06.560 --> 38:07.560\nYeah.\n\n38:07.560 --> 38:12.560\nNot rhyming lasers with tasers and lasers.\n\n38:12.560 --> 38:13.560\nYou could have said phasers.\n\n38:13.560 --> 38:16.560\nBut pop phasers was right there.\n\n38:16.560 --> 38:19.560\nThat's the only thing that's in Star Trek.\n\n38:19.560 --> 38:20.560\nYeah.\n\n38:20.560 --> 38:22.560\nThey don't have tasers.\n\n38:22.560 --> 38:24.560\nI was, I was trying to do double duty where I was like,\n\n38:24.560 --> 38:27.560\ntrying to rap like a rapper that hasn't seen Star Trek.\n\n38:27.560 --> 38:28.560\nI was rapping about Star Trek.\n\n38:28.560 --> 38:30.560\nFreddie Cooper has lasers.\n\n38:30.560 -->

nitpicking my improv lyrics.\n\n38:38.560 --> 38:39.560\nOkay.\n\n38:39.560 --> 38:40.560\nNew segment.\n\n38:40.560 --> 38:41.560\nIt's called Sperm Count Questions.\n\n38:41.560 --> 38:42.560\nSperm Count Questions.\n\n38:42.560 --> 38:49.560\nSperm Count, you hear it a lot, but what do you do?\n\n38:49.560 --> 38:51.560\nWhat do you got here, Sperm?\n\n38:51.560 --> 38:53.560\nAnd it's being

to kill the music.\n\n39:25.560 --> 39:26.560\nYou give me that kind of like.\n\n39:26.560 --> 39:27.560\nOh, okay.\n\n39:27.560 --> 39:28.560\nNo, I won't do it.\n\n39:28.560 --> 39:31.560\nI'll give you the out and the music and then you go on.\n\n39:31.560 --> 39:32.560\nOh, we should have a signal.\n\n39:32.560 --> 39:33.560\nUh-huh.\n\n39:33.560 --> 39:34.560\nOh, I see.\n\n39:34.560 -->

39:41.560\nNo, I'm just doing, I'm just going off your lead.\n\n39:41.560 --> 39:42.560\nI don't want to have a signal.\n\n39:42.560 --> 39:44.560\nI want this to be a fluid thing.\n\n39:44.560 --> 39:45.560\nOkay.\n\n39:45.560 --> 39:46.560\nUsually it really is.\n\n39:46.560 --> 39:50.560\nYou guys, I'm always amazed that you know when to cut the music out.\n\n39:50.560 --> 39:51.560\nRight.\n\n39:51.560 --> 39:53.560\nBut sometimes I blow it all the way.\n\n39:53.560 --> 39:55.560\nIt's a fluid thing.\n\n39:55.560 --> 39:56.560\nAll right.\n\n39:56.560 --> 39:57.560\nSperm Count Questions.\n\n39:57.560 --> 40:00.560\nDo we ask you Sperm Count Questions or do you have Sperm Count Questions for us?\n\n40:00.560 --> 40:01.560\nI have Sperm Count Questions.\n\n40:01.560 --> 40:02.560\nOkay.\n\n40:02.560 --> 40:03.560\nOh, okay.\n\n40:03.560 --> 40:04.560\nI have one question.\n\n40:04.560 --> 40:05.560\nWhat?\n\n40:05.560 --> 40:06.560\nWhat's a good number?\n\n40:06.560 --> 40:07.560\nOkay.\n\n40:07.560 --> 40:08.560\n80, 80.\n\n40:08.560 --> 40:09.560\n80?\n\n40:09.560 --> 40:10.560\nNo, I don't know.\n\n40:10.560 --> 40:11.560\n80, 80.\n\n40:11.560 --> 40:12.560\nIt's like for what?\n\n40:12.560 --> 40:13.560\n80, 80.\n\n40:13.560 --> 40:14.560\nIt's 80, 80.\n\n40:14.560 --> 40:15.560\nOh yeah.\n\n40:15.560 --> 40:16.560\nMy Sperm's an 80, 80, bro.\n\n40:16.560 --> 40:17.560\nI'm good.\n\n40:17.560 --> 40:19.560\nYou got 80 Sperms out of 80.\n\n40:19.560 --> 40:20.560\nPossibility to get Sperms.\n\n40:20.560 --> 40:21.560\nYeah.\n\n40:21.560 --> 40:22.560\nI got 80 out of 80 possible Sperms.\n\n40:22.560 --> 40:23.560\nOkay.\n\n40:23.560 --> 40:25.280\nSo here's the thing about Sperm Count.\n\n40:25.280 --> 40:26.280\nHere's the theory.\n\n40:26.280 --> 40:27.280\nOkay.\n\n40:27.280 --> 40:33.480\nSo I come and then there's some sperm and then you take a needle and then you're like,\n\n40:33.480 --> 40:39.960\nyou have some sample size like a cubic micron or whatever the fuck it is and then you go\n\n40:39.960 --> 40:40.960\nin and you-\n\n40:40.960 --> 40:41.960\nYou're doing this?\n\n40:41.960 --> 40:42.960\nNo, I'm not doing it.\n\n40:42.960 --> 40:43.960\nOkay.\n\n40:43.960 --> 40:44.960\nSorry.\n\n40:44.960 --> 40:45.960\nA spermologist is doing it.\n\n40:45.960 --> 40:46.960\nWhatever the people that count your sperm.\n\n40:46.960 --> 40:53.120\nSo as far as I understand it, the idea is that what it is, it's like a ratio to amount\n\n40:53.120 --> 40:54.120\nof fluid.\n\n40:54.120 --> 40:55.120\nRight?\n\n40:55.120 --> 40:56.120\nI would assume so.\n\n40:56.120 --> 40:57.120\nOkay.\n\n40:57.120 --> 41:01.320\nHow much, I think it's density of usable shit in the ejaculate.\n\n41:01.320 --> 41:03.480\nI would think it's like the sperm and not the semen.\n\n41:03.480 --> 41:04.480\nRight.\n\n41:04.480 --> 41:05.480\nWhat is this gesture?\n\n41:05.480 --> 41:06.480\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n41:06.480 --> 41:08.480\nYou know, it's the sperm.\n\n41:08.480 --> 41:09.480\nA gentleman's raising his hand over here.\n\n41:09.480 --> 41:10.480\nDo you know the answer to this?\n\n41:10.480 --> 41:11.480\nWe do know the answer.\n\n41:11.480 --> 41:13.480\nIt's not like how many you have.\n\n41:13.480 --> 41:14.480\nCan you get up and grab a microphone?\n\n41:14.480 --> 41:15.480\nYeah.\n\n41:15.480 --> 41:16.480\nYou'll have to come up and talk about sperm.\n\n41:16.480 --> 41:17.480\nSorry.\n\n41:17.480 --> 41:23.480\nSperm Count answers.\n\n41:23.480 --> 41:26.240\nThe same thing happens in Nightmare on Elm Street part two.\n\n41:26.240 --> 41:27.920\nThere's this whole scene in the biology class.\n\n41:27.920 --> 41:30.240\nI just spent 20 minutes talking about it right now.\n\n41:30.240 --> 41:31.240\nSorry.\n\n41:31.240 --> 41:32.240\nWhat's your name, young man?\n\n41:32.240 --> 41:33.240\nWho have you been up here before?\n\n41:33.240 --> 41:34.240\nI have.\n\n41:34.240 --> 41:35.240\nIt's Scoota.\n\n41:35.240 --> 41:36.240\nScoota.\n\n41:36.240 --> 41:37.240\nOh.\n\n41:37.240 --> 41:38.240\nHow can I forget?\n\n41:38.240 --> 41:39.240\nShit.\n\n41:39.240 --> 41:40.240\nHow do you spell it?\n\n41:40.240 --> 41:41.240\nS-K-U-T-A.\n\n41:41.240 --> 41:42.240\nOkay.\n\n41:42.240 --> 41:43.240\nYeah.\n\n41:43.240 --> 41:44.240\nAll right.\n\n41:44.240 --> 41:45.240\nScoota.\n\n41:45.240 --> 41:46.240\nSo I don't know why, but I learned it recently, I believe.\n\n41:46.240 --> 41:50.360\nSo the sperm count, you have like the sample, and then they have like a, I don't know if\n\n41:50.360 --> 41:55.640\nthey use real eggs or not, but what they count is how many make it to the egg.\n\n41:55.640 --> 41:56.640\nWait.\n\n41:56.640 --> 41:57.640\nReally?\n\n41:57.640 --> 41:59.140\nLike in a simulated waystrap?\n\n41:59.140 --> 42:02.040\nHow many viable sperm make it through an actual egg?\n\n42:02.040 --> 42:03.040\nRight.\n\n42:03.040 --> 42:04.040\nYeah.\n\n42:04.040 --> 42:07.440\nLike some, like, sometimes like alcohol use or some drug use makes your sperm like kind\n\n42:07.440 --> 42:08.440\nof lazy.\n\n42:08.440 --> 42:09.440\nSure.\n\n42:09.440 --> 42:10.440\nTell me about it.\n\n42:10.440 --> 42:11.440\nWait.\n\n42:11.440 --> 42:12.440\nScoota.\n\n42:12.440 --> 42:13.440\nWait.\n\n42:13.440 --> 42:14.440\nSo you'd have like a smaller count because less would make it to the egg.\n\n42:14.440 --> 42:15.440\nOkay.\n\n42:15.440 --> 42:17.000\nWell, where is the egg that they're using in the counting?\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:18.000\nLike what?\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:19.000\nI don't know.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:20.000\nIt's a lady.\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:21.000\nIt's Martha.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:22.000\nIt's Martha.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:23.500\nIt's also the same lady.\n\n42:23.500 --> 42:24.800\nIt's the same lady for all of us.\n\n42:24.800 --> 42:25.800\nIt's one lady.\n\n42:25.800 --> 42:26.800\nShe's old now.\n\n42:26.800 --> 42:29.800\nShe just has a window in her, in her like ovaries.\n\n42:29.800 --> 42:30.800\nYeah.\n\n42:30.800 --> 42:31.800\nThey're like, one, two.\n\n42:31.800 --> 42:36.000\nShe's like a cow at the state fair that you can watch grass digest with this like, they\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:39.880\nput, they put, they put semen and then they come, it will be back at six hours, Gloria.\n\n42:39.880 --> 42:40.880\nAnd she's like, okay.\n\n42:40.880 --> 42:47.000\nShe puts on headphones and it's like, I don't know what song it's playing.\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:53.640\nI was a highway man, drop of rain.\n\n42:53.640 --> 42:56.560\nBut then they come back in and they, and they, I mean, seriously, come on.\n\n42:56.560 --> 42:59.000\nThere's like, well, now this is, this raises 90 more questions.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:00.000\nHow do you count?\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:04.280\nScoota, you're saying they're using actual viable eggs and creating a situation where\n\n43:04.280 --> 43:08.720\nthe sperm, they would find out how much, yeah, they basically, it's like the active sperm\n\n43:08.720 --> 43:12.480\nyou have versus bullshit, deadbeat, never going to make it right.\n\n43:12.480 --> 43:18.040\nSo they do, I guess, organize a race and they see how many make the finish line.\n\n43:18.040 --> 43:19.040\nSperm race.\n\n43:19.040 --> 43:20.040\nYeah.\n\n43:20.040 --> 43:22.760\nWell, all of my questions about sperm powder have to do with how they do it.\n\n43:22.760 --> 43:25.360\nSo I mean, that's an interesting answer, but it doesn't.\n\n43:25.360 --> 43:26.360\nCan anybody else verify or deny?\n\n43:26.360 --> 43:27.360\nIs it like a maze?\n\n43:27.360 --> 43:28.360\nWhat's your name?\n\n43:28.360 --> 43:29.360\nMichael.\n\n43:29.360 --> 43:30.360\nMichael, get the fuck up here.\n\n43:30.360 --> 43:33.840\nMichael knows more sperm answers.\n\n43:33.840 --> 43:39.280\nWelcome to Sperm and Town.\n\n43:39.280 --> 43:40.280\nHow's it going?\n\n43:40.280 --> 43:42.320\nAlso, I could have Googled it.\n\n43:42.320 --> 43:43.320\nNo.\n\n43:43.320 --> 43:45.720\nI think we both read the same Reddit post.\n\n43:45.720 --> 43:46.720\nScoota.\n\n43:46.720 --> 43:47.720\nYeah.\n\n43:47.720 --> 43:51.520\nThere was a post recently about how when you smoke marijuana, it makes your sperm have\n\n43:51.520 --> 43:52.520\nless motility.\n\n43:52.520 --> 43:54.400\nSo they get lazy.\n\n43:54.400 --> 44:00.000\nAnd so how they measure it is just like literally watch them move and they travel away from\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:01.000\na point.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.440\nSo they just look at them on a microscope and they literally just measure the distance.\n\n44:03.440 --> 44:04.440\nThey pick a radius.\n\n44:04.440 --> 44:05.440\nYeah.\n\n44:05.440 --> 44:07.440\nIt's like, and they don't care what direction they go.\n\n44:07.440 --> 44:08.440\nYeah.\n\n44:08.440 --> 44:09.440\nIt's just like, oh, they went pretty far.\n\n44:09.440 --> 44:10.440\nOkay.\n\n44:10.440 --> 44:31.480\nBut okay, so let's say I come onto a microscope slide with a picture of a redhead on it.\n\n44:31.480 --> 44:35.640\nYou put it under the microscope and now you see, well, you're going to see like a random\n\n44:35.640 --> 44:41.120\nnumber of sperm, they have to like, do they have a set number?\n\n44:41.120 --> 44:42.920\nSo is the sperm count?\n\n44:42.920 --> 44:48.120\nI always thought the count was the amount of sperm at a zoa per, like, per sample.\n\n44:48.120 --> 44:49.120\nThat's what I thought.\n\n44:49.120 --> 44:50.120\nLike density.\n\n44:50.120 --> 44:51.120\nWell, it's not.\n\n44:51.120 --> 44:52.120\nWhat's your name?\n\n44:52.120 --> 44:53.120\nWill.\n\n44:53.120 --> 44:54.120\nGet the fuck up here, Will.\n\n44:54.120 --> 44:55.120\nYeah.\n\n44:55.120 --> 44:56.120\nI will sacrifice.\n\n44:56.120 --> 44:57.120\nScoota.\n\n44:57.120 --> 44:58.120\nScoota, you're gone.\n\n44:58.120 --> 44:59.120\nScoota.\n\n44:59.120 --> 45:00.120\nScoota.\n\n45:00.120 --> 45:03.120\nThis is like the worst game show ever, isn't it?\n\n45:03.120 --> 45:09.040\nAnd the prize is going to be the worst prize.\n\n45:09.040 --> 45:10.040\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n45:10.040 --> 45:11.040\nMy name's Will.\n\n45:11.040 --> 45:12.040\nWill.\n\n45:12.040 --> 45:13.040\nOkay.\n\n45:13.040 --> 45:14.040\nAnd so they actually measure several things.\n\n45:14.040 --> 45:17.040\nBut one thing is sperm count, which is the number of sperm per volume.\n\n45:17.040 --> 45:18.040\nOkay.\n\n45:18.040 --> 45:19.040\nThey also measure motility that he talked about.\n\n45:19.040 --> 45:20.440\nThat's called the SPV, right?\n\n45:20.440 --> 45:21.440\nSure.\n\n45:21.440 --> 45:22.440\nOkay.\n\n45:22.440 --> 45:23.440\nSperm count.\n\n45:23.440 --> 45:24.440\nSperm count.\n\n45:24.440 --> 45:26.600\nBut then they do have motility, which is how many of them are moving well.\n\n45:26.600 --> 45:27.600\nOkay.\n\n45:27.600 --> 45:28.600\nLike a percentage of how many are moving well.\n\n45:28.600 --> 45:29.600\nAll right.\n\n45:29.600 --> 45:30.600\nSo sperm count.\n\n45:30.600 --> 45:31.600\nThere's morphology also.\n\n45:31.600 --> 45:32.600\nWhat is that?\n\n45:32.600 --> 45:34.120\nHow many look defective?\n\n45:34.120 --> 45:35.120\nHow many actually look odd?\n\n45:35.120 --> 45:36.120\nLike two-headed sperm.\n\n45:36.120 --> 45:37.120\nLike two-headed sperm and crooked sperm.\n\n45:37.120 --> 45:38.720\nDo you want it to make it two-the-egg?\n\n45:38.720 --> 45:39.720\nYeah.\n\n45:39.720 --> 45:44.800\nI don't care about anything but sperm count, because you always hear these statistics about\n\n45:44.800 --> 45:47.400\noh, the average sperm count's gone down, or this lowers your sperm.\n\n45:47.400 --> 45:51.320\nI just want to know, how do they count sperm?\n\n45:51.320 --> 45:56.320\nBecause if it's per volume, so that's per asset volume.\n\n45:56.320 --> 46:06.240\nSo the thing is, it's not like forgive me, ladies, cover your ears.\n\n46:06.240 --> 46:10.760\nIt's not like my balls have a bunch of cum in them, including the sperm, and then it's\n\n46:10.760 --> 46:11.760\nlike a bag of liquid.\n\n46:11.760 --> 46:13.320\nAlso, man, close your ears too.\n\n46:13.320 --> 46:14.320\nYeah.\n\n46:14.320 --> 46:15.320\nEverybody.\n\n46:15.320 --> 46:21.680\nAnd then it all comes out like it's like, my balls are making sperm cells.\n\n46:21.680 --> 46:24.880\nThe liquid that makes up a majority of the semen.\n\n46:24.880 --> 46:28.200\nSemen comes from some other place in my body.\n\n46:28.200 --> 46:29.200\nProstate.\n\n46:29.200 --> 46:30.200\nProstate.\n\n46:30.200 --> 46:31.200\nProstate.\n\n46:31.200 --> 46:32.200\nAnd the seminal vesicle.\n\n46:32.200 --> 46:33.200\nThere we go.\n\n46:33.200 --> 46:34.200\nYeah.\n\n46:34.200 --> 46:35.200\nAnd don't forget the cowper's gland.\n\n46:35.200 --> 46:36.200\nWhat about...\n\n46:36.200 --> 46:37.200\nIsn't...\n\n46:37.200 --> 46:38.200\nIsn't Vaz deference?\n\n46:38.200 --> 46:39.200\nIt's better to get up here.\n\n46:39.200 --> 46:40.200\nThe Vaz deference.\n\n46:40.200 --> 46:41.200\nVaz deference.\n\n46:41.200 --> 46:49.560\nSo what volume are they taking when you cum?\n\n46:49.560 --> 46:52.960\nIs there a joke that's like, there's a Vaz deference between sperm and semen?\n\n46:52.960 --> 46:53.960\nYou just made it.\n\n46:53.960 --> 46:54.960\nYou just made it.\n\n46:54.960 --> 46:55.960\nIs that...\n\n46:55.960 --> 46:56.960\nYou just made it.\n\n46:56.960 --> 46:57.960\nThat's not...\n\n46:57.960 --> 46:58.960\nThere's no way that's the first time.\n\n46:58.960 --> 46:59.960\nNo.\n\n46:59.960 --> 47:00.960\nI wish you guys would take this seriously.\n\n47:00.960 --> 47:04.360\nThey take a measured amount and they just count them.\n\n47:04.360 --> 47:09.520\nBut they take what out of the wad that comes out, sorry ladies, the fucking cloudy wad.\n\n47:09.520 --> 47:13.480\nThe fucking like, it's like, it looks like the earth in there.\n\n47:13.480 --> 47:16.360\nIt looks like there's like North America and Australia.\n\n47:16.360 --> 47:17.360\nThere's like...\n\n47:17.360 --> 47:18.360\nIt's on your bathroom floor.\n\n47:18.360 --> 47:19.360\nI mean, how do you...\n\n47:19.360 --> 47:20.360\nThere's like...\n\n47:20.360 --> 47:21.360\nYou know what cum looks like.\n\n47:21.360 --> 47:24.480\nLike there's like, it doesn't look like glue.\n\n47:24.480 --> 47:25.960\nIt looks like fucking...\n\n47:25.960 --> 47:26.960\nWe know...\n\n47:26.960 --> 47:31.080\nDino, our friend who we all know very well from his shady encounters, he was...\n\n47:31.080 --> 47:33.200\nDid he talk about him being a sperm donor for a while?\n\n47:33.200 --> 47:34.200\nYeah, Dino was.\n\n47:34.200 --> 47:35.200\nYeah.\n\n47:35.200 --> 47:36.200\nAnd he was...\n\n47:36.200 --> 47:37.200\nDid we discuss that in the show?\n\n47:37.200 --> 47:41.640\nSo he would go in there and like donate sperm all the time so Dino may have countless\n\n47:41.640 --> 47:42.640\nchildren out there.\n\n47:42.640 --> 47:43.640\nWe have no idea.\n\n47:43.640 --> 47:44.640\nThat's terrifying.\n\n47:44.640 --> 47:52.440\nThe woman that ran the sperm counter, counter, the counter where you put your sperm on to\n\n47:52.440 --> 47:53.440\nhave it counted.\n\n47:53.440 --> 47:54.440\nYes.\n\n47:54.440 --> 47:56.640\nShe would look at it and go, get the fucking back in there.\n\n47:56.640 --> 47:57.640\nLike this is just water.\n\n47:57.640 --> 48:01.080\nLike you've been jerking off too much.\n\n48:01.080 --> 48:04.440\nCome back when you haven't jerked off all fucking day long and bring me some actual\n\n48:04.440 --> 48:05.440\nlike, cum.\n\n48:05.440 --> 48:09.880\nShe could tell me by looking at it, we can't do anything with this is all.\n\n48:09.880 --> 48:10.880\nAll right.\n\n48:10.880 --> 48:12.400\nSo that kind of goes to my point, I guess.\n\n48:12.400 --> 48:17.080\nThe idea, I mean, this is not a, this is an organic, like I still don't, I don't understand\n\n48:17.080 --> 48:18.440\nthis idea that you can scientifically...\n\n48:18.440 --> 48:19.680\nIt's a solution.\n\n48:19.680 --> 48:21.680\nIt's not like one constant thing.\n\n48:21.680 --> 48:25.680\nSo in the solution, there's some stuff that's sperm, that's swimming sperm, and some stuff\n\n48:25.680 --> 48:26.680\nthat supports it.\n\n48:26.680 --> 48:27.680\nBut sometimes...\n\n48:27.680 --> 48:28.680\nOkay.\n\n48:28.680 --> 48:29.680\nThey measure a set amount of volume.\n\n48:29.680 --> 48:30.680\nOkay.\n\n48:30.680 --> 48:31.680\nSo here's, okay.\n\n48:31.680 --> 48:33.600\nSo here's my follow up question.\n\n48:33.600 --> 48:34.600\nPlease sir.\n\n48:34.600 --> 48:35.600\nSimmer down.\n\n48:35.600 --> 48:37.800\nWe'll get to you in a moment.\n\n48:37.800 --> 48:39.840\nThat's beef steak bill, I believe.\n\n48:39.840 --> 48:40.840\nWhat do you do, Will?\n\n48:40.840 --> 48:41.840\nWhat's your job?\n\n48:41.840 --> 48:44.360\nI work for a health insurance company.\n\n48:44.360 --> 48:45.360\nOkay.\n\n48:45.360 --> 48:51.040\nSo I think I'm starting to get this, what I'm deducing from this is that when you, forgive\n\n48:51.040 --> 48:54.200\nme ladies, just, I'll be with you in one moment.\n\n48:54.200 --> 49:01.560\nWhen you come, like you're coming like a random amount of fluid, like sometimes, you know,\n\n49:01.560 --> 49:05.600\nit's like, you know, it's like a little bit, and sometimes it's a lot.\n\n49:05.600 --> 49:08.880\nSometimes it's just dust.\n\n49:08.880 --> 49:11.440\nI can't use this, come back.\n\n49:11.440 --> 49:12.440\nAnd so I'm assuming...\n\n49:12.440 --> 49:13.440\nCook the mail.\n\n49:13.440 --> 49:15.880\nWe're going to table that comment until a little later.\n\n49:15.880 --> 49:21.080\nAnd so I'm assuming, like, that what that means is that the amount of fluid that comes\n\n49:21.080 --> 49:25.920\nout of your wiener when you have an orgasm has nothing to do.\n\n49:25.920 --> 49:30.560\nThat's like just a, that's just fluid, that your sperm count, even on a bad day, or a\n\n49:30.560 --> 49:35.400\nbad, bad day, meaning like less fluid coming out of your wiener, like during an orgasm,\n\n49:35.400 --> 49:40.960\nthat that would have the same sperm count as Wednesday when you're like, whoa, it took\n\n49:40.960 --> 49:45.640\nme a long time, and whew, like, and it's like, wow, look at all that, but it's like\n\n49:45.640 --> 49:49.880\nsame sperm, still, still three, three per drop, though.\n\n49:49.880 --> 49:52.960\nCan I ask you a, probably, what might be a personal back straight question?\n\n49:52.960 --> 49:54.880\nAre you going in regularly to a...\n\n49:54.880 --> 49:58.480\nNo, I'm asking this because I'm just curious about how they count sperm.\n\n49:58.480 --> 50:00.400\nNo, this is not, there's nothing personal about it.\n\n50:00.400 --> 50:01.400\nHave you, have you gone in?\n\n50:01.400 --> 50:02.400\nAnd it shouldn't have taken this long.\n\n50:02.400 --> 50:03.520\nI just want to know how they count sperm.\n\n50:03.520 --> 50:05.640\nHave you already gone in and tried this, or this is, this is...\n\n50:05.640 --> 50:06.640\nNo.\n\n50:06.640 --> 50:07.640\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n50:07.640 --> 50:08.640\nI just said no.\n\n50:08.640 --> 50:09.640\nOkay, so I'm sorry.\n\n50:09.640 --> 50:14.240\nI'm just wondering, have you gone in to the, I don't know why I'm just so frustrated with\n\n50:14.240 --> 50:15.240\nyou guys tonight.\n\n50:15.240 --> 50:17.640\nLike, I don't, I don't, like, it's gotta be me.\n\n50:17.640 --> 50:20.640\nI honestly really thought that you, like, this is something that you have gone in and\n\n50:20.640 --> 50:24.680\ntried multiple times, the way that you started talking about it sounded like, like...\n\n50:24.680 --> 50:25.680\nNo, because then I just know about it.\n\n50:25.680 --> 50:26.680\nI don't, I don't...\n\n50:26.680 --> 50:31.200\nHe's just curious, and I think your question is, when it, when it's a lot, or when it's\n\n50:31.200 --> 50:36.200\na little, is it still the same number of sperm and it's just more liquid, or is it the same\n\n50:36.200 --> 50:37.800\ndensity, hence more sperm?\n\n50:37.800 --> 50:38.800\nYes.\n\n50:38.800 --> 50:39.800\nYes.\n\n50:39.800 --> 50:40.800\nYes.\n\n50:40.800 --> 50:41.800\nSo how do they, like...\n\n50:41.800 --> 50:42.800\nI couldn't tell you that.\n\n50:42.800 --> 50:43.800\nRight.\n\n50:43.800 --> 50:44.800\nI mean, it should be...\n\n50:44.800 --> 50:45.800\nI've only read it.\n\n50:45.800 --> 50:49.560\nJust mathematically, yeah, it should just average out to the point that they could do science\n\n50:49.560 --> 50:51.640\nand determine what's good or bad.\n\n50:51.640 --> 50:56.760\nSo each man is walking around with a certain amount of sperm that he sets to the task whenever\n\n50:56.760 --> 51:02.000\nhe ejaculates, and, but, but it always happens with a random amount of fluid.\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:08.160\nAnd that, that sample of sperm might be lazy, weirdo sperm, so they might be, they might\n\n51:08.160 --> 51:09.160\nbe good ones.\n\n51:09.160 --> 51:10.520\nAnd when they're counting them, they're not worried about that.\n\n51:10.520 --> 51:15.440\nThey'll go like, well, you got a very high sperm count, but they all look like Greg Allman.\n\n51:15.440 --> 51:16.440\nYeah.\n\n51:16.440 --> 51:19.160\nFour tails, you know, it works.\n\n51:19.160 --> 51:20.160\nAll right.\n\n51:20.160 --> 51:21.640\nWell, let's thank our sperm panel.\n\n51:21.640 --> 51:22.640\nSprimpanel!\n\n51:22.640 --> 51:23.640\nSprimpanel!\n\n51:23.640 --> 51:24.640\nYep.\n\n51:24.640 --> 51:25.640\nCome again.\n\n51:25.640 --> 51:26.640\nYep.\n\n51:26.640 --> 51:32.120\nHey, you forgot your drink.\n\n51:32.120 --> 51:33.120\nYou forgot it.\n\n51:33.120 --> 51:34.120\nWho forgot it?\n\n51:34.120 --> 51:35.120\nOkay.\n\n51:35.120 --> 51:36.120\nNot you guys, you're good.\n\n51:36.120 --> 51:37.120\nMichael's sperm and Will's sperm.\n\n51:37.120 --> 51:40.880\nScoot his sperm.\n\n51:40.880 --> 51:42.120\nThat scoot is a looker, huh?\n\n51:42.120 --> 51:43.120\nYeah, man.\n\n51:43.120 --> 51:44.400\nHe's a handsome young man.\n\n51:44.400 --> 51:51.680\nI thought, I thought, you could be in a nightmare in Elm Street movie.\n\n51:51.680 --> 51:55.560\nIs that what, are we connecting dots right now?\n\n51:55.560 --> 51:56.560\nYeah, yeah.\n\n51:56.560 --> 51:57.560\nA nightmare in Elm Street too.\n\n51:57.560 --> 51:58.560\nI'm gonna count my sperm.\n\n51:58.560 --> 52:03.560\nI don't know what we're, I don't know what we're, and I want Scooter to do all the counting.\n\n52:03.560 --> 52:10.000\nIf I wanted to have a baby with a woman and raise it with a man, how would my sperm count\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:11.000\nmatter?\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:12.000\nYeah.\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:15.000\nDamn, why is that on your mind?\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:16.000\nIs that because it's just...\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:17.000\nIt's just random.\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:18.000\nWhy is anything?\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:19.000\nIt's just...\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:20.000\nIt's just because you're thinking of child rearing?\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:23.920\nI think it's because he was thinking that sometimes he comes a lot and sometimes he\n\n52:23.920 --> 52:26.840\ncomes a little and he's like, well, how does that work when they're counting it?\n\n52:26.840 --> 52:30.920\nI guess that's probably when it popped in my head today when I jerked off, yeah.\n\n52:30.920 --> 52:31.920\nIt's also weird.\n\n52:31.920 --> 52:34.560\nOh, and I was like, oh, that's a little, it felt good though.\n\n52:34.560 --> 52:35.560\nIt...\n\n52:35.560 --> 52:36.560\nBut it's also...\n\n52:36.560 --> 52:39.240\nAnd then I was like, and then I was like laying there and going to sleep on a nice summer\n\n52:39.240 --> 52:41.440\nafternoon and I was like, ah, it feels good.\n\n52:41.440 --> 52:45.400\nI wonder if it feels better when there's more liquid that comes out or when there's more\n\n52:45.400 --> 52:46.640\nsperm coming out.\n\n52:46.640 --> 52:47.640\nIt is interesting.\n\n52:47.640 --> 52:48.640\nAnd you said this...\n\n52:48.640 --> 52:52.480\nAnd then I thought, well, there's probably, there's probably not a variation in the sperm\n\n52:52.480 --> 52:57.080\nbecause there's sperm count and they like, and then that's why I thought, so.\n\n52:57.080 --> 53:01.440\nYou said this, it isn't that this is gonna be so gross, but if you take longer, there's\n\n53:01.440 --> 53:03.880\nmore that comes out.\n\n53:03.880 --> 53:07.960\nIs it like your body like sort of like, he worked hard for this?\n\n53:07.960 --> 53:09.960\nGive him more.\n\n53:09.960 --> 53:10.960\nYeah.\n\n53:10.960 --> 53:11.960\nI mean, that's weird.\n\n53:11.960 --> 53:12.960\nIt's so weird.\n\n53:12.960 --> 53:13.960\nI don't know what kind...\n\n53:13.960 --> 53:14.960\nOur bodies are weird.\n\n53:14.960 --> 53:15.960\nWell, we had that anthropologist guy, doctor.\n\n53:15.960 --> 53:16.960\nWhat's his name?\n\n53:16.960 --> 53:21.280\nThe guy was, I never remember anyone's name, but that guy was like the punk rock anthropologist\n\n53:21.280 --> 53:25.480\nwho's one of his big theories that people know him for is that the human penis has a\n\n53:25.480 --> 53:28.720\nhead on it because it's a plunger.\n\n53:28.720 --> 53:30.280\nIt's supposed to like, you know...\n\n53:30.280 --> 53:35.720\nI'll scrape out, just suck out, like, like, like pull back, like the previous competitors.\n\n53:35.720 --> 53:37.480\nOh, dear God.\n\n53:37.480 --> 53:40.680\nI don't think that does not happen.\n\n53:40.680 --> 53:44.040\nI don't think when I have sex, there's more sperm in my penis.\n\n53:44.040 --> 53:48.560\nWell, he's saying, get that other guy that just fucked you up before me, get it, remove\n\n53:48.560 --> 53:49.560\nhis stuff.\n\n53:49.560 --> 53:50.920\nBut into your penis.\n\n53:50.920 --> 53:52.920\nNot into your penis now.\n\n53:52.920 --> 53:55.920\nHey, how do you...\n\n53:55.920 --> 53:57.800\nI thought it's like...\n\n53:57.800 --> 53:58.800\nThat's called the syringe.\n\n53:58.800 --> 53:59.800\nGet it, get it, get it.\n\n53:59.800 --> 54:00.800\nThat's called the syringe.\n\n54:00.800 --> 54:01.800\nThat's called the syringe.\n\n54:01.800 --> 54:02.800\nAnd then mine.\n\n54:02.800 --> 54:03.800\nNo, no, no.\n\n54:03.800 --> 54:04.800\nThat would be amazing.\n\n54:04.800 --> 54:12.600\nThat would be so amazing if that's like the pinnacle of human competitiveness is like,\n\n54:12.600 --> 54:16.160\nit's like, now your cum's in my dick.\n\n54:16.160 --> 54:20.200\nThat's how straight I am.\n\n54:20.200 --> 54:25.200\nIn my dreams, you're still the same.\n\n54:25.200 --> 54:29.960\nSo his thing is that the head script takes out all the other...\n\n54:29.960 --> 54:36.400\nIt's like a plunger, like you're creating suction on the way out, I think it's pulling\n\n54:36.400 --> 54:37.400\nback.\n\n54:37.400 --> 54:38.400\nI don't...\n\n54:38.400 --> 54:43.800\nAnimals probably had that, and then it evolved less and less, but it's probably a remnant\n\n54:43.800 --> 54:44.800\nof that.\n\n54:44.800 --> 54:45.800\nI can imagine.\n\n54:45.800 --> 54:46.800\nIt could be, who knows.\n\n54:46.800 --> 54:50.440\nI think what's interesting is actually, I think the important thing about anthropology\n\n54:50.440 --> 54:55.400\nis not proving things, but actually coming up with crazy theories because we are basing\n\n54:55.400 --> 54:59.480\nall of our understanding on humanity and crazy theories that regularly get disproved.\n\n54:59.480 --> 55:03.560\nIn 1995, we found out a bunch of shit that they're still teaching in high schools that's\n\n55:03.560 --> 55:06.600\nbased on 50s understanding of anthropology.\n\n55:06.600 --> 55:10.360\nIt all fell apart in 95, but they still teach the same thing, which is basically that we\n\n55:10.360 --> 55:15.560\nwere apes and trees and that there was some kind of climatic change that put us onto the\n\n55:15.560 --> 55:20.640\nplains in the savannah environment, and then that's why we started walking up right and\n\n55:20.640 --> 55:21.640\nall this stuff.\n\n55:21.640 --> 55:24.240\nNo, no, that's been proven false.\n\n55:24.240 --> 55:29.480\nIt's been proven very, very unlikely if not actually proven false by analyzing the food\n\n55:29.480 --> 55:32.560\nthat we ate at certain times in our evolutionary.\n\n55:32.560 --> 55:33.560\nAnyways...\n\n55:33.560 --> 55:40.240\nSo we're never going to know anything because we're trying to dig up our own bones and figure\n\n55:40.240 --> 55:48.240\nout at what point did we stop being monkeys and start being these amazing specimens.\n\n55:48.240 --> 55:56.240\nI like that half ass flourish.\n\n55:56.240 --> 56:00.200\nAlright, so it was an actual...\n\n56:00.200 --> 56:04.600\nI was playing the Mad Max video game all day today.\n\n56:04.600 --> 56:05.600\nAnd you liked this game.\n\n56:05.600 --> 56:06.600\nWell, I was shit talking to you.\n\n56:06.600 --> 56:09.360\nI thought you had a very funny tweet about it, about the dog.\n\n56:09.360 --> 56:10.360\nYeah.\n\n56:10.360 --> 56:11.360\nWell, thank you.\n\n56:11.360 --> 56:13.640\nI mean, it was an actual...\n\n56:13.640 --> 56:15.640\nMy dogs are going insane from the fucking...\n\n56:15.640 --> 56:16.640\nI thought it was very funny.\n\n56:16.640 --> 56:19.760\nI had to go clear the minefields because there's a dog in the game that barks when you're near\n\n56:19.760 --> 56:20.760\na mine.\n\n56:20.760 --> 56:21.760\nAnd the dog...\n\n56:21.760 --> 56:22.760\nBut here's the interesting...\n\n56:22.760 --> 56:23.760\nIs it a game based on the new film?\n\n56:23.760 --> 56:24.760\nNo.\n\n56:24.760 --> 56:29.640\nNo, they were making it before that movie got greenlit.\n\n56:29.640 --> 56:34.160\nBut then they kind of put a bunch of Fury Road kind of stuff in it, too.\n\n56:34.160 --> 56:37.120\nLike the title, I think.\n\n56:37.120 --> 56:40.720\nBut yeah, the dogs...\n\n56:40.720 --> 56:41.720\nSo the dogs...\n\n56:41.720 --> 56:46.440\nObviously, what's happening is they recorded a dog, a real dog, and they don't know what\n\n56:46.440 --> 56:47.440\nthe...\n\n56:47.440 --> 56:51.080\nThey're just having the dog bark and then having the dog growl and then having the dog do different\n\n56:51.080 --> 56:54.560\nkinds of barks because you're using the different kinds of barks to find the mines that you\n\n56:54.560 --> 56:55.560\nhave to defuse.\n\n56:55.560 --> 56:58.960\nSo obviously, the dog is saying something like, like, my name's Roger.\n\n56:58.960 --> 57:00.120\nHey, hey, I'm over here.\n\n57:00.120 --> 57:01.120\nMy name's Roger.\n\n57:01.120 --> 57:02.120\nLike, or something.\n\n57:02.120 --> 57:03.120\nWho knows what it's saying?\n\n57:03.120 --> 57:04.120\nLike, it could be...\n\n57:04.120 --> 57:05.120\nI don't know how they got the dog to bark.\n\n57:05.120 --> 57:06.120\nThey might have shown it a picture of a cat.\n\n57:06.120 --> 57:07.120\nSo it's going like, everybody, look at this cat.\n\n57:07.120 --> 57:08.120\nThis cat.\n\n57:08.120 --> 57:09.120\nThere's a cat in front of me.\n\n57:09.120 --> 57:10.120\nMy name's Steve.\n\n57:10.120 --> 57:11.120\nMy name's Steve.\n\n57:11.120 --> 57:12.120\nI'm a dog.\n\n57:12.120 --> 57:13.120\nI'm looking at a cat.\n\n57:13.120 --> 57:14.320\nBut at any rate, like, the dogs are just like...\n\n57:14.320 --> 57:17.360\nBecause if there was a video game, but you didn't know what video game's where, and you\n\n57:17.360 --> 57:22.120\njust all of a sudden, you heard some guy in your house going, like, hey, hey, happy birthday.\n\n57:22.120 --> 57:23.120\nHappy birthday.\n\n57:23.120 --> 57:24.120\nI had a birthday once.\n\n57:24.120 --> 57:25.120\nMy name's Mike.\n\n57:25.120 --> 57:26.120\nMy name's Mike.\n\n57:26.120 --> 57:27.120\nIt's my birthday, too.\n\n57:27.120 --> 57:32.120\nYou'd also do the human equivalent of what the dogs are doing, which is like not bark,\n\n57:32.120 --> 57:34.120\nbut you'd like grab a butcher knife or like go...\n\n57:34.120 --> 57:36.120\nLike, they're going to go right.\n\n57:36.120 --> 57:37.120\nSo the dogs are like...\n\n57:37.120 --> 57:40.120\nThey're freaking out, and Harvey already, like, he freaks out when he sees dogs.\n\n57:40.120 --> 57:44.120\nThen he sees the dog in the Mad Max car, like, barking at the bombs, and he's just freaking\n\n57:44.120 --> 57:45.120\nout.\n\n57:45.120 --> 57:46.120\nAnd...\n\n57:46.120 --> 57:48.960\nBut then over time, they got used to it.\n\n57:48.960 --> 57:49.960\nSo I think that's very...\n\n57:49.960 --> 57:55.120\nThe dogs, they understand, like, they started to figure out it was a recording.\n\n57:55.120 --> 57:57.800\nBecause that's why they don't react every time music comes on.\n\n57:57.800 --> 57:58.800\nThey're not like, where's Beck?\n\n57:58.800 --> 58:00.120\nWhy is Beck in the house?\n\n58:00.120 --> 58:06.120\nDo you ever notice that animals, they don't freak out as much as they should about, like,\n\n58:06.120 --> 58:07.120\nTV and music?\n\n58:07.120 --> 58:08.120\nLike, what it's just playing?\n\n58:08.120 --> 58:12.220\nLike, given how fucking freaked out they get when they hear, like, a raccoon, a block\n\n58:12.220 --> 58:15.120\naway, like, scratch its ass, like, they're like...\n\n58:15.120 --> 58:21.120\nOr when there's a ghost in your closet.\n\n58:21.120 --> 58:22.120\nYou know it.\n\n58:22.120 --> 58:23.120\nYou've seen it.\n\n58:23.120 --> 58:26.120\nDon't act all scientific.\n\n58:26.120 --> 58:33.120\nDo you think your dog, when it sees a dog on TV, is like, oh, that's a dog?\n\n58:33.120 --> 58:35.120\nI don't know, because they change sides.\n\n58:35.120 --> 58:36.120\nLike, why does the dog...\n\n58:36.120 --> 58:37.120\nYeah.\n\n58:37.120 --> 58:38.120\nI don't...\n\n58:38.120 --> 58:39.120\nBut Nigel doesn't do it.\n\n58:39.120 --> 58:44.920\nNigel reacts to the barking sounds, like, in stuff, but he doesn't watch TV.\n\n58:44.920 --> 58:45.920\nHarvey watches TV.\n\n58:45.920 --> 58:50.800\nAnd if he sees a dog or a Danny DeVito, he, like, freaks out.\n\n58:50.800 --> 58:51.800\nAnd that's not a joke.\n\n58:51.800 --> 58:53.120\nLike, a Danny DeVito, like...\n\n58:53.120 --> 58:55.120\nBecause he cuts the silhouettes.\n\n58:55.120 --> 58:59.120\nLike, late, always sunny.\n\n58:59.120 --> 59:02.120\nBut then, well, that's what I thought, because I was like, oh, he gets scruffier.\n\n59:02.120 --> 59:03.120\nYou should try, like, different versions.\n\n59:03.120 --> 59:06.120\nBut then he was barking at the iTunes menu, and it was the Rainmaker movie, the key art.\n\n59:06.120 --> 59:11.120\nHe's walking next to Matt Damon with a briefcase, and he's like, I'm like, it's fucking DeVito.\n\n59:11.120 --> 59:17.120\nYou should try Batman Returns to see if in the Penguin makeup, if he still barks.\n\n59:17.120 --> 59:18.120\nYeah.\n\n59:18.120 --> 59:20.120\nBut honestly, the novelties weren't off of me.\n\n59:20.120 --> 59:23.120\nAnd now it's just terror, because it means your dog can read.\n\n59:23.120 --> 59:25.120\nI don't understand, like, he does it, because it cuts.\n\n59:25.120 --> 59:27.120\nLike, does he think that he's looking through a magic window?\n\n59:27.120 --> 59:28.120\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n59:28.120 --> 59:29.120\nThat's always changing.\n\n59:29.120 --> 59:32.120\nI think he's probably just reacting to very simple stimulus, like, the sound of something.\n\n59:32.120 --> 59:34.120\nAnd you realize, okay, that's only sound.\n\n59:34.120 --> 59:35.120\nThere's no smell to that.\n\n59:35.120 --> 59:36.120\nLike, it's not connected for me.\n\n59:36.120 --> 59:37.120\nRight.\n\n59:37.120 --> 59:38.120\nI bet smell is a big way.\n\n59:38.120 --> 59:42.120\nSo I'm hearing a noise, but I'm not connecting it to a thing.\n\n59:42.120 --> 59:44.120\nOr I'm smelling something, but where's the visual?\n\n59:44.120 --> 59:48.120\nLike, I would guess that it's very simple little stimuli.\n\n59:48.120 --> 59:49.120\nMaybe?\n\n59:49.120 --> 59:51.120\nI don't know, man, because I think it is.\n\n59:51.120 --> 59:52.120\nWell, it's...\n\n59:52.120 --> 59:53.120\nI understand that...\n\n59:53.120 --> 59:57.120\nI mean, you could say that about anything, honestly, with any animal, including us.\n\n59:57.120 --> 01:00:02.120\nBut the thing is, like, he sees the dog on the screen, and then forget about barking.\n\n01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.120\nLike, just like we're watching, like, a cartoon where, like, a dog loves cereal.\n\n01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:09.120\nAnd there's, like, a cartoon dog walking on its hind legs.\n\n01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.120\nSchrab's dog, by the way, does this with the family guy.\n\n01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.120\nThat fucking dog, like, his dog recognizes as a dog and starts freaking out.\n\n01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.120\nIt's like, it looks like a coffee mug.\n\n01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.120\nIt doesn't even look like a dog.\n\n01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:23.120\nIt's like an artistic expression of the idea of a dog.\n\n01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.120\nAnd the dog's like, yeah, that's a dog.\n\n01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:30.120\nWhat we've done to dogs, like, Canis Familiaris, like, domesticated dogs, is we've made them...\n\n01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.120\nWhat did you call them?\n\n01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.120\nCanis Familiaris, I believe, is the species, right?\n\n01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.120\nAm I getting that right?\n\n01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.120\nThat's all dogs that are...\n\n01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:39.120\nWell, that's what we call, like, our domesticated dogs.\n\n01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.120\nLike, not wolves.\n\n01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.120\nIronically, when you're on unfamiliar terms with them.\n\n01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.120\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.120\nIt's as familiar as you're going to get with a Canis.\n\n01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.120\nIt's the best case scenario.\n\n01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.120\nBut, like, we breed certain dogs for herding.\n\n01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.120\nSo, like, if you have, like, a German shepherd, or like an Australian shepherd,\n\n01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.120\nand you walk them down the road, they bark at cars moving,\n\n01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.120\nbecause they want to herd, like, moving things next to you.\n\n01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.120\nThey want to move things.\n\n01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.120\nOther dogs are about burrowing.\n\n01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.120\nOther dogs are about sheltering.\n\n01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.120\nOther dogs are about just straight at protection.\n\n01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.120\nSo, we've bred them to do very specific tasks.\n\n01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.120\nAnd now, Harvey is one.\n\n01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.120\nSo, what do you think those golden retriever and a poodle are?\n\n01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120\nWhat are those wiener dogs for?\n\n01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.120\nDo you think they're for, like, cleaning the insides of cannons?\n\n01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.120\nThey're fluffy little dogs.\n\n01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.120\nI asked a guy that on the sidewalk.\n\n01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.120\nWe have to get inside this cannon, but I won't go in there.\n\n01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.120\nI told this story on the show, I'm sure, like,\n\n01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.120\nbecause I asked that of a guy on the sidewalk.\n\n01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.120\nI was looking at his little dog, and I was like,\n\n01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.120\nI was like, oh, I never noticed, like,\n\n01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.120\nyou see cartoons of these things, or you see them in movies,\n\n01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.120\nbut I just realized it's a regular-sized dog,\n\n01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.120\nbut it's just, like, it's a dwarf.\n\n01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:53.120\nIt has, like, little, tiny, stunted legs.\n\n01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.120\nAnd I was just, like, marveling at it.\n\n01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.120\nI was like, huh, we really did a number on these things.\n\n01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:03.120\nAnd what do you, you know, every dog has, like,\n\n01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.120\na thing, what do you think these things are for?\n\n01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.120\nLike, going back to, what was their purpose?\n\n01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.120\nAnd I, like, sometimes would be rambling,\n\n01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.120\nbecause it was a friend of, like, Ridley's or something\n\n01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.120\nthat he was just talking to, and I was just, like,\n\n01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.120\nlike, kind of, like, shitting on his dog.\n\n01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.120\nI don't know, I guess I was like, yeah,\n\n01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:22.120\nI was like, and then halfway through my questions\n\n01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.120\nabout the dog breed, he was like,\n\n01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.120\nI don't know, I didn't invent him, I just own him.\n\n01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.120\nWow.\n\n01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.120\nLike, he was kind of defensive, like, I guess it felt like\n\n01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.120\nI was accusing him of, like, eugenics or something.\n\n01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.120\nI feel like a good question.\n\n01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.120\nA lot of the really extreme, like, breeds that, like,\n\n01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.120\nthey are, like, like, porgy's and, like,\n\n01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.120\nI think, like, the wiener dogs, whatever they call those,\n\n01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.120\nand, like, giant dogs, those have been,\n\n01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.120\nwe have made those extreme by breeding those just for looks.\n\n01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.120\nRight.\n\n01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120\nThat's just fascinating.\n\n01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.120\nYeah, and, like, the 1800s, it's just, like, rich British people going,\n\n01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120\nlike, I want to think that...\n\n01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.120\nIf you took a British bulldog back when it was actually\n\n01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.120\nmore like the actual dog, it kind of was bred to be,\n\n01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.120\nlike, naturally, it was a much more effective,\n\n01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.120\nlike, healthy dog, and now we've taken that dog\n\n01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.120\nand made it way less healthy, and Sharpays are just,\n\n01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.120\nyou know, riddled with disease, and German Shepherds,\n\n01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.120\nthere's no reason where the spines are curved like that.\n\n01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.120\nWhat's the dog that has, like, the alcohol\n\n01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.120\nto save people in the snow?\n\n01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.120\nSt. Bernard's.\n\n01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120\nIn cartoons?\n\n01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120\nSt. Bernard's.\n\n01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120\nSnoop Dogg.\n\n01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.120\nAnd that's what that's for.\n\n01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.120\nYeah.\n\n01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.120\nAnd you know, you know, they sew those...\n\n01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.120\nThey sew those barrels to their necks.\n\n01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120\nOh, no.\n\n01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.120\nThey're born with them now.\n\n01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.120\nIt's really inhumane.\n\n01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.120\nYeah.\n\n01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.120\nI think wiener dogs chase rats.\n\n01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.120\nI think that's why they're bred.\n\n01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.120\nTerriers, like rat terriers, their legs are small\n\n01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.120\nso they can get through little holes,\n\n01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.120\nand they kept rats off your farm and out of your grain\n\n01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.120\nso that you could sell your shit without them.\n\n01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.120\nAnd they have a heavy, heavy, like, relative to dogs,\n\n01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.120\na huge, like, their diagnosable OCD, the terriers.\n\n01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.120\nOh, really?\n\n01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.120\nLike Jack Russell's in particular,\n\n01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.120\nlike, because they're such good rodent dogs,\n\n01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.120\nthey've bred, now they've bred, it's like,\n\n01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.120\nthey're obsessed with detail.\n\n01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.120\nThey're obsessed with holes, electrical outlets,\n\n01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.120\ncorners of the coffee table.\n\n01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.120\nIf they start licking your face, they can't stop.\n\n01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.120\nYou know, like...\n\n01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.120\nAnd they hear my new scratches.\n\n01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.120\nThe coolest thing, like, my friend has a Jack Russell terrier\n\n01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.120\nand it's like, do we live in a house full of ghosts\n\n01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.120\nbecause this dog is hearing something at all times\n\n01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.120\nand trying to burrow through the wall?\n\n01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.120\nLike, he's just a burrower.\n\n01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.120\nSo by that logic, your dog was maybe bred\n\n01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.120\nto fight Danny DeVito.\n\n01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.120\nAnd there's some guy who hates Danny DeVito\n\n01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.120\nwho's like, I fucking bred this dog.\n\n01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.120\nI don't know where it went.\n\n01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.120\nOr maybe just bring him to me.\n\n01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.120\nYeah.\n\n01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.120\nHe's in Hollywood, maybe he'll run into Danny DeVito\n\n01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.120\nat some point.\n\n01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.120\nYeah, he gets out of the yard for three days,\n\n01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.120\nhe comes back and let Danny DeVito\n\n01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.120\njust in his mouth.\n\n01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.120\n40 years ago...\n\n01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.120\nI'm so sorry, sir.\n\n01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.120\nLet me call you an Uber.\n\n01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.120\nIt's a golden noodle.\n\n01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120\nI understand.\n\n01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.120\nI get it all the time.\n\n01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.120\nIt happens like three times a week.\n\n01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.120\nAnd I hope you won't take this personally,\n\n01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:07.120\nbut I'm leading the charge on legislation\n\n01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.120\nagainst these animals.\n\n01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.120\nDanny DeVito seems awesome, just a side note.\n\n01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.120\nEvery story you hear about him would confirm that, yeah.\n\n01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.120\nHe sounds fun by all counts.\n\n01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.120\nAll right, Danny DeVito slipped through the cracks.\n\n01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.120\nThe highway men, not so lucky.\n\n01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.120\nNightmare on Elm Street too.\n\n01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.120\nYou're a little competitive tonight, Dan.\n\n01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.120\nI feel like you're coming in loaded for bear.\n\n01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.120\nYou want to win these arguments as opposed to...\n\n01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.120\nMaybe it's because I was playing Mad Max all day.\n\n01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:42.120\nI was playing Mad Max, I wasn't what I was going to say.\n\n01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.120\nI am getting into the game now,\n\n01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:47.120\nand you're doing a lot of car combat.\n\n01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.120\nI was kind of going like,\n\n01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.120\nWhat a lovely day, what a lovely day!\n\n01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.120\nAnd then like six o'clock,\n\n01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.120\nI bothered to go outside to play fetch with the dogs,\n\n01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.120\nand it was like, Oh shit, what a lovely day.\n\n01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:06.120\nIt's 9-Eleven, what a lovely day!\n\n01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.120\nWhat a lovely day!\n\n01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.120\nWhat wasn't a lovely day?\n\n01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.120\nIt's the opposite of a lovely day.\n\n01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.120\n9-Eleven.\n\n01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.120\nI mean, meteorologically it was a lovely day.\n\n01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:24.120\nOkay, let's move off.\n\n01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.120\nWe can't be like, Listen.\n\n01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.120\nSilver lining, it was gorgeous.\n\n01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:31.120\nIt was like 79 degrees.\n\n01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:35.120\nI mean, it could not have happened on a more beautiful day.\n\n01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.120\nI can't say any of that.\n\n01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.120\nWhat else do you have on your list?\n\n01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.120\nI thought maybe we should check in with you\n\n01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.120\nbecause we don't see you anymore.\n\n01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.120\nWhat's been going on?\n\n01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.120\nYour show is doing well, everyone loves it.\n\n01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:55.120\nYou're shooting in movies now in all kinds of places.\n\n01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.120\nThe thing I was most excited about was,\n\n01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.120\nI did an episode of X-Files.\n\n01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:08.120\nThat was the one that I was really, truly, very, very nervous about.\n\n01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.120\nAnd very, very excited.\n\n01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.120\nCan we know what your role was\n\n01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.120\nor is that disclosure that you're not allowed to?\n\n01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.120\nNo, I don't think I could say, but it's not a huge role,\n\n01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.120\nbut it's not tiny either.\n\n01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.120\nI saw a photo, you were dressed in some sort of official outfit.\n\n01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.120\nYeah.\n\n01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.120\nYou were allowed to post that or you're not allowed to post that?\n\n01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.120\nYeah, I'm an animal control officer\n\n01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.120\nbecause that's what it says on my badge, so I guess,\n\n01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.120\nI think they will maybe annoyed that I,\n\n01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.120\nbut you know, it's the X-Files.\n\n01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.120\nThere's animal control officers.\n\n01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.120\nBut it was crazy because I, honestly,\n\n01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.120\nI found out two months before I did it and I was like,\n\n01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.120\nI didn't tell anybody, I didn't watch a single episode\n\n01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.120\nbecause I was freaked out.\n\n01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:50.120\nAnd then when I landed, I was like, fine.\n\n01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.120\nI was like, I worked on the scenes.\n\n01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.120\nI was like, I'm not going to be nervous.\n\n01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.120\nAnd then when they picked me up, they gave me a folder\n\n01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.120\nand it said, Kumail, Nanjiani, X-Files,\n\n01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.120\nwelcome folder.\n\n01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.120\nAnd it was Mulder's like, I want to believe poster,\n\n01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.120\nbut instead of, I want to believe it was my name.\n\n01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.120\nAnd that's what I called Emily.\n\n01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.120\nI was like, Emily, I'm freaking out a little bit right now.\n\n01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.120\nYou need to talk me down.\n\n01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.120\nWhat did you mean you said you didn't watch a single episode?\n\n01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.120\nI didn't watch for two months before\n\n01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.120\nbecause I'd known for two months I was going to do it\n\n01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.120\nbecause I didn't want to start freaking out.\n\n01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.120\nYou didn't want to know, you didn't want to have too much information\n\n01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.120\nabout the show you were going to be on in your head.\n\n01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.120\nOr be too much of a nervous fanboy.\n\n01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.120\nYeah, I just wanted it to be a job and not like,\n\n01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.120\nfucking the dream, I never dare dream coming true, you know?\n\n01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.120\nThat makes sense.\n\n01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120\nSee, that's why I'm not an actor.\n\n01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.120\nCompare yourself to all the other actors that were ever on it\n\n01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.120\nand all that stuff.\n\n01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.120\nI wouldn't even have had that common sense.\n\n01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.120\nI would have been like, oh, I should watch every episode twice\n\n01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.120\nso that I really know the tone of the show.\n\n01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.120\nAnd then I'd be like, to be or not to be.\n\n01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.120\nAnd they'd be like, what are you doing?\n\n01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.120\nI'm like, well, I want to watch all the show.\n\n01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.120\nI know the show super well, so that wasn't the...\n\n01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.120\nBut I had to sort of like pretend to be cool around them\n\n01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.120\nlike, oh, hello, David, Jillian.\n\n01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.120\nNice to meet you.\n\n01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.120\nDid you get to work closely with those two?\n\n01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120\nYeah.\n\n01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:07.120\nThat's great.\n\n01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.120\nHe loves to cool there a little bit.\n\n01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.120\nYeah.\n\n01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.120\nYeah.\n\n01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.120\nBecause I didn't just talk to...\n\n01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.120\nScooter, take a sperm count on that just now.\n\n01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.120\nIt's skyrocketed.\n\n01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.120\nIt's 15080.\n\n01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.120\nWow.\n\n01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.120\nThat's a very rare case.\n\n01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.120\nI had this moment where I didn't just meet...\n\n01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.120\nI had a scene with them.\n\n01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.120\nI had a couple of scenes with them.\n\n01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.120\nWell, I had scenes with them.\n\n01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:36.120\nIt's pretty hard for me to talk about without getting teary eyed.\n\n01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.120\nDon't be shy.\n\n01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.120\nSo I had this moment where I was like, I didn't...\n\n01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.120\nBecause I was talking to, you know,\n\n01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.120\nJillian Anderson, David Duchovny, and I kind of like, you know,\n\n01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.120\nI was with them for three days.\n\n01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.120\nAnd then during one of the scenes, I was like,\n\n01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.120\noh, I'm talking to Mulder and Scully now.\n\n01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.120\nLike, I didn't just talk to David Duchovny and Jillian Anderson.\n\n01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.120\nI talked to Mulder and Scully.\n\n01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.120\nWith the haircuts and the...\n\n01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.120\nWith the haircuts and the everything.\n\n01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.120\nAnd the cell phones and the...\n\n01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120\nFlashlights.\n\n01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.120\nAnd the simmering sexual tension.\n\n01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.120\nYeah, it was great.\n\n01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.120\nI hope I'm good in it.\n\n01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.120\nI have no idea.\n\n01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.120\nUsually when I do a job, I'm like, oh, I did well.\n\n01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.120\nOr that wasn't as good.\n\n01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.120\nThis one, I have no idea.\n\n01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.120\nI could be like...\n\n01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.120\nSo I'm a failure as a fan,\n\n01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.120\nbecause I don't even know the details.\n\n01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.120\nLike, is Chris Carter running it?\n\n01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.120\nYeah.\n\n01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.120\nAnd are a lot of the old writers back?\n\n01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.120\nOr is he...\n\n01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120\nA lot of them are back.\n\n01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.120\nNot Vince Gilligan.\n\n01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.120\nBut my...\n\n01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.120\nWhy not?\n\n01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.120\nHe just was at home, you know,\n\n01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.120\nhanging out.\n\n01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.120\nI...\n\n01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.120\nThe episode was written and directed\n\n01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.120\nby my favorite ex-files writer, Darren Morgan.\n\n01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.120\nDarren Morgan.\n\n01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.120\nYeah.\n\n01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.120\nIs that the guy that did the Jose...\n\n01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.120\nYeah, that's the guy that did that one\n\n01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.120\nand Clyde Brockman's final reposition.\n\n01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.120\nSpencer, are you a big ex-files fan?\n\n01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.120\nNope.\n\n01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.120\nI just listened to the podcast.\n\n01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.120\nProbably everybody that listens to our podcast\n\n01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.120\nknows Gommel is a podcast called The Ex-Files Files.\n\n01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.120\nAnd he talks to, like, lots of...\n\n01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.120\nYeah.\n\n01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.120\nHe's gone all the way...\n\n01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.120\nI mean, this has to be the best-case scenario.\n\n01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.120\nYou start a podcast about something you love.\n\n01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120\nDo you...\n\n01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.120\nI mean, were you hired because you're a successful actor\n\n01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.120\nright now, or because you have that podcast,\n\n01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.120\nor a mixture of both, or...\n\n01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.120\nI mean, they clearly were, like,\n\n01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.120\nit'll mean so much to this guy.\n\n01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.120\nThat's great!\n\n01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.120\nAnd it does.\n\n01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.120\nYeah, they were...\n\n01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.120\nI want to start a podcast called Vivian Westwood Suits.\n\n01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.120\nYeah.\n\n01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.120\nThat's actually a smart move for, like,\n\n01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.120\nnot a huge part, but an important part.\n\n01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.120\nBecause thinking as a producer, I'd be like,\n\n01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.120\nwell, this guy's not going to complain if we go over time.\n\n01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.120\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.120\nI was like, I'm here.\n\n01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.120\nWhat do you guys need?\n\n01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.120\nI can serve the food, whatever you want.\n\n01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.120\nWe need you to get into makeup, and then just sit.\n\n01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.120\nWe're going to shoot you whenever the other actors are busy.\n\n01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.120\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.120\nYeah.\n\n01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.120\nOkay.\n\n01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.120\nThank you for having me.\n\n01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.120\nI want to go back to what you said earlier.\n\n01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.120\nLike you say, sometimes you walk away from having shot something,\n\n01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:52.120\nand you go nailed it, or sucked, but you have...\n\n01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.120\nI have zero sense...\n\n01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.120\nWas your memory just completely overblown?\n\n01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.120\nNo, I remember every single moment.\n\n01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:01.120\nIt was like, I don't know if I'm good in this, or...\n\n01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.120\nIt was hard.\n\n01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:04.120\nBecause it's also outside of my...\n\n01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.120\nLike, I haven't done sci-fi or horror stuff.\n\n01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.120\nI've done most of the content.\n\n01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.120\nWas it heavy lifting?\n\n01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.120\nDid you have a lot of emotional range stuff to go through,\n\n01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.120\nor was it pretty...\n\n01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.120\nIt wasn't like a fully easy part.\n\n01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.120\nLike, it was kind of hard.\n\n01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.120\nLike, there was...\n\n01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.120\nI had to, like, do stuff,\n\n01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.120\ninstead of just, like, crack-wise.\n\n01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.120\nYeah.\n\n01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.120\nSo, it was a hard part.\n\n01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.120\nDid you labor over the rehearsal, like, at home?\n\n01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.120\nOh, my God.\n\n01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.120\nI worked on it so much.\n\n01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.120\nI worked on it so much.\n\n01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.120\nAnd that's what it's hard to know, like...\n\n01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:37.120\nWell, then when you get there and you worked on it really hard,\n\n01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.120\nthen it's just noises that you're making,\n\n01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.120\nand you have...\n\n01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.120\nIt's candy.\n\n01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.120\nOh, shit.\n\n01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.120\nYeah, that's Alan Woo.\n\n01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.120\nAlan Woo, who probably became a director\n\n01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.120\nbecause he loves attention.\n\n01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.120\nHe loves...\n\n01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.120\nDo you know Alan, or do you...\n\n01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.120\nOh, you know, you're just...\n\n01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.120\nWhy did you guys do...\n\n01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.120\nHe would like...\n\n01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.120\nHe nodded at Cumeo.\n\n01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.120\nAttack on the show.\n\n01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.120\nOh, Attack on the show.\n\n01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.120\nYeah.\n\n01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.120\nAlan Woo.\n\n01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.120\nAlan Woo.\n\n01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.120\nAlan Woo.\n\n01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.120\nAlan Woo.\n\n01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.120\nHey, I'm gonna go to the bathroom, you guys.\n\n01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.120\nOh.\n\n01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.120\nOkay.\n\n01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.120\nAll right.\n\n01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.120\nThat's nice to get a...\n\n01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:14.120\nThat's probably the first applause he's gotten for that since 1987.\n\n01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.120\nYeah.\n\n01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:23.120\nYeah, you know, I mean, yeah, when do you get applause for that?\n\n01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.120\nDoes anyone remember being potty trained?\n\n01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.120\nIs that a memory?\n\n01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:31.120\nNo, but I remember my cousin, who was my age, ate his own shit,\n\n01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.120\nand it was a huge family scandal.\n\n01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.120\nA scandal?\n\n01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.120\nYeah, it was like spoken in hushedowns.\n\n01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:39.120\nLike his mom came in and she saw him.\n\n01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.120\nAt what age are we talking?\n\n01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.120\nI don't know, but we...\n\n01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.120\nLike infancy or a toddler?\n\n01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.120\nEnough to be walking around and stuff.\n\n01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.120\nAnd he just picked up some poop and just...\n\n01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.120\nWell, he...\n\n01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.120\nHe tried it on for says.\n\n01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.120\nShe put him on the toilet, and then when she came back,\n\n01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.120\nhe had done his business and he was like...\n\n01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:58.120\nHe was bent over and just like pulling out and eating it like,\n\n01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.120\nlike, oh, I poop too much.\n\n01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.120\nI should put...\n\n01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.120\nHe did not say I poop too much.\n\n01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.120\nNo, he didn't say anything.\n\n01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.120\nHe just gave it and he was like, hey, look.\n\n01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.120\nBut that would be a great time for a catchphrase because,\n\n01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.120\nlike, no one's ever going to forget whatever you say there.\n\n01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.120\nYou could just be like, no new taxes.\n\n01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.120\nThere shouldn't be new taxes.\n\n01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:22.120\nLike, you could get a guy elected if you ate your own shit and then looked at the camera\n\n01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.120\nand were like, remember this.\n\n01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:28.120\nDo you think it's a kid being guilty about poopies or he's starving?\n\n01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.120\nLike, feed me more food.\n\n01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.120\nWhat was his thing?\n\n01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.120\nYeah.\n\n01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.120\nI think he was just an adventurous kid that was like,\n\n01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.120\nlet's see what this is about.\n\n01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.120\nWell, you know, I mean...\n\n01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.120\nOh, no.\n\n01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.120\nFreud's big thing was like...\n\n01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:46.120\nI mean, I think Freud's been sort of like discredited by his...\n\n01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.120\nthe people that came after him, which...\n\n01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.120\nAnd I think a little too much because it's not like we all question Ben Franklin\n\n01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.120\nwhen we talk about electricity.\n\n01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:56.120\nLike, Freud was the first guy to go, what if your brain is complicated?\n\n01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.120\nAnd before that, it was just like, you're a lady.\n\n01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.120\nYou should lay down.\n\n01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.120\nYou're hysterical.\n\n01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.120\nYour uterus is making you crazy.\n\n01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:06.120\nAnd Freud was like, no, what if there's like a bunch of shit in your brain\n\n01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.120\nthat you don't even understand and why we should take shits on him\n\n01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.120\nbecause he also said we all want to fuck our moms.\n\n01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.120\nI don't know.\n\n01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.120\nBut anyways, that was my Freud defense segment.\n\n01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:23.120\nBut Freud's thing was like, what is the first thing you ever do as a sentient mammal?\n\n01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:27.120\nOther mammals, deer are born and they start walking\n\n01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.120\nand kids are like, we're born conscious.\n\n01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.120\nAnd we may not be born moral, but we're born conscious and sentient.\n\n01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:38.120\nAnd then the first thing that happens is you make something.\n\n01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:42.120\nYou make something that's not you, but you made it, it came out of you.\n\n01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.120\nAnd so things can happen.\n\n01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:48.120\nFreud's theory was that things are happening formatively to you,\n\n01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:52.120\ndepending on the attitudes in your world toward the thing you made.\n\n01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:56.120\nAnd then the other things, the things you put in your mouth is like,\n\n01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.120\nthat's all you can do.\n\n01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.120\nYou grab things and you stick them in your mouth.\n\n01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.120\nHow do people react to that?\n\n01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.120\nHow do you feel about that?\n\n01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.120\nAnd you make a duty and you've heard those phrases,\n\n01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:08.120\nthe anal fixation and the oral fixation and stuff.\n\n01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:11.120\nBut anyways, I believe that's totally valid.\n\n01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.120\nThat's the stuff that makes sense.\n\n01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:17.120\nThe penis plunger, I don't doubt it, but it's so specific.\n\n01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.120\nWe have our episode title, I know that.\n\n01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.120\nSimple things make sense to me.\n\n01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.120\nOh yeah, your mom's the first person,\n\n01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.120\nyour first woman you meet and your dad's the first man you meet.\n\n01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.120\nYou can't really argue with the simplicity of that.\n\n01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.120\nYou can then argue about neuroplasticity and whether or not\n\n01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.120\nyou still have a chance to overcome your nurture and your nature.\n\n01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:42.120\nBut it's still like simple shit makes sense to me.\n\n01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:45.120\nYou take a shit when you have shit on your hand in the crib\n\n01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.120\nand then you're like, probably,\n\n01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.120\nI'm sure we all ate our own shit at some point.\n\n01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:53.120\nWe just didn't get caught and didn't do it like a weird cartoon,\n\n01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:55.120\nlike a Heathcliff cartoon.\n\n01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.120\nHe's got a turd and he goes like this\n\n01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.120\nand then there's a fish bone comes out.\n\n01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.120\nThis guy took it to a Popeye place.\n\n01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:09.120\nHe deserves the shame that he probably still lives with.\n\n01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:12.120\nHow, as the cousin you said, what was he?\n\n01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.120\nYeah, what's his first and last name?\n\n01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.120\nI mean, what town does he live in?\n\n01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.120\nHow has he adjusted? Has he grown up into a happy, healthy human being?\n\n01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.120\nOh yeah, he's a doctor.\n\n01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.120\nWell, who are some of his patients?\n\n01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.120\nMaybe they're listeners.\n\n01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:32.120\nHe's a radiologist who are like, I think they're like, yeah.\n\n01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.120\nLook at X-rays.\n\n01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.120\nAnd they're in charge of whether or not you get over or under-radiated\n\n01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.120\nwhen you're, so someone out there\n\n01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.120\ndoesn't know that the guy at the button\n\n01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:44.120\nwants ate his own shit out of the toilet.\n\n01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.120\nYeah.\n\n01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.120\nDo you remember when you...\n\n01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.120\nI don't have any memories of potty training.\n\n01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.120\nSpencer, I also...\n\n01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.120\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.120\nAre you okay? Do you want to talk about your poopies?\n\n01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.120\nNo, I just had to pee.\n\n01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.120\nThat was a pee. He was gone for 45 seconds.\n\n01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.120\nOh, okay, you just had to pee, okay.\n\n01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.120\nHe came back like a ghost.

01:34:01.120\nmaybe act a little bit more adult\n\n01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.120\nwe reached a point in our life where we can't get away with\n\n01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:05.120\nquite as much anymore\n\n01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:07.120\nwe still feel like\n\n01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.120\nlittle babies but we're not\n\n01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.120\npeople expect more of us so\n\n01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.120\nwe're just trying to be better human beings\n\n01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.120\nand so we invite people on who may or may not be\n\n01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:17.120\ngrown up and then we sort of ask them\n\n01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.120\nare you an adult or are you a little cutie\n\n01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.120\nwhich we could pause it to the group\n\n01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:23.120\nit took us a few episodes\n\n01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:25.120\nto actually\n\n01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.120\nsolidify the definition of little cuties\n\n01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.120\nso\n\n01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:31.120\na little bit but then we got there\n\n01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.120\nI was trying to make a big\n\n01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.120\nall-encompassing life philosophy\n\n01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.120\nwhich I realized\n\n01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.120\nthree episodes and I wasn't smart enough to do\n\n01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.120\nI wasn't even included in that\n\n01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.120\nso I felt like\n\n01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.120\nso yeah\n\n01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:47.120\nthen somewhere on the fourth episode we went to a stand up
