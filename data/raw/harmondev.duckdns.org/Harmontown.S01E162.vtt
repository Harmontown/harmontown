WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.400
From Hollywood, California In the steamy, Cambodian deathfields of the

00:14.400 --> 00:29.320
warmth of Meltdown Comics' nerd-melt theater, Harmon Chowd, is now in session.

00:29.320 --> 00:35.880
The audience has made an agreement to laugh despite their discomfort, despite bathing

00:35.880 --> 00:39.760
in the warm humidity of each other's armpits.

00:39.760 --> 00:47.560
Speaking of which, let's bring out Spencer Quintzen.

00:47.560 --> 01:04.240
I have a good idea, let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown and bring this shit to order,

01:04.240 --> 01:06.240
Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:06.240 --> 01:30.720
We've got a couple of items of official business, we've got some awareness, this segment's

01:30.720 --> 01:39.400
called Boring Awareness Things about our show, Boring, sometimes you gotta say stuff

01:39.400 --> 01:44.360
about your show, and if anyone is listening for the first time, they're like, this is

01:44.360 --> 01:50.120
like every podcast, the first ten minutes is about a bunch of shit, as if I listen to

01:50.120 --> 01:59.680
the podcast every week, but I don't, sorry, but we're one of them tonight, we're doing

01:59.680 --> 02:05.120
this Harmon Quest thing, it's for real now, it's been a long time.

02:05.120 --> 02:11.760
I thought it was a working title, but I think it's too late now to change it.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.480
If anyone has any ideas, let us know.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.680
No, I don't think we can change the title.

02:18.680 --> 02:23.200
Is that you admitting that you want to keep that title no matter what, even in the face

02:23.200 --> 02:24.200
of a better title?

02:24.200 --> 02:32.200
I would love to have come up with something like pencils and swords, but obviously I didn't,

02:32.200 --> 02:38.240
I did come up with that, but I was like, well that's dumb, I'm quite happy with Harmon

02:38.240 --> 02:44.360
Quest, it's an offshoot of Harmontown, and now we go on a quest, I think that makes

02:44.360 --> 02:51.640
very linear sense to me, an offshoot of Harmontown, wouldn't you ideally like the thing

02:51.640 --> 02:59.400
to stand on its own, if I was Kevin Smith, would you want it to be called like Smith,

02:59.400 --> 03:06.080
Smith, Smithness, Smiths and Sorcery, or would you want a chance to be like, well, Kevin

03:06.080 --> 03:11.480
Smith's in it, however, I also like Dungeons & Dragons, I don't want to force, it's like

03:11.480 --> 03:19.720
Appetown, hey, I don't care, you got to drink my Kool-Aid, otherwise you can't even give

03:19.720 --> 03:20.720
this show a shot.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.400
Are you saying it's too late to make that change now?

03:23.400 --> 03:24.400
Yes.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.720
Why is it too late, we haven't even shot at it?

03:27.720 --> 03:31.800
I don't know, because I assume that the larger wheels turn earlier and more slowly.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.040
They're not drawing up billboards right now.

03:34.040 --> 03:39.160
Alright, well I'll make a call on Tuesday, but I better have a list of the types.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.720
I'm glad we announced the name sucking.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.720
Alright.

03:42.720 --> 03:49.560
Are you saying that we should put that flair up in the air for people to give us names

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
for it?

03:50.560 --> 03:55.280
No, because then they'll sue us.

03:55.280 --> 03:59.600
But the real reason we bring it up is because the tapings, which we're going to do, regardless

03:59.600 --> 04:02.880
of what it ends up being called, are happening very soon.

04:02.880 --> 04:08.480
Within the next couple weeks, September 15th, we start taping for a week, two weeks.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.640
Yeah, like eight days, I think?

04:10.640 --> 04:16.320
Eight days, yeah, it's like a weekish, and there's like five separate tapings that we're

04:16.320 --> 04:21.320
going to need each of which will be yielded out of each of those things.

04:21.320 --> 04:25.120
Yeah, there's five nights with two showings each night, I believe, so you can sign up

04:25.120 --> 04:27.160
for any of those ten shows?

04:27.160 --> 04:29.680
No, I think you can sign up for any of those five nights.

04:29.680 --> 04:30.960
Oh, and you're there the whole night?

04:30.960 --> 04:36.920
You're there for two shows, two episodes worth of taping, which will take a couple hours,

04:36.920 --> 04:41.720
and we'll move you around in the seats between each episode, so it looks like there's a different

04:41.720 --> 04:48.480
crowd every night, and we'll change shirts, but you'll be there for two episodes, which

04:48.480 --> 04:49.480
I think will be good.

04:49.480 --> 04:55.640
That's the way we did the original stuff, and so what I'm going to do, because we don't

04:55.640 --> 04:58.640
have the information that you need right now, also I think it would be weird for me to announce

04:58.640 --> 05:03.920
it right now, because then to the extent that you are an adoring fan, you'd have to spend

05:03.920 --> 05:08.680
the next five minutes going like, let me get my foot in that door before it sells out.

05:08.680 --> 05:14.520
I'm flattering myself, I know, but I want you to just enjoy and not have anxiety about

05:14.520 --> 05:19.320
like Black Monday or whatever the hell it's called, Boxing Day or, you know, I don't want

05:19.320 --> 05:22.560
this rush for, the cabbage patch doll rush.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.560
Cyber Tuesday.

05:23.560 --> 05:31.280
So what I'll do is on Tuesday at noon, noonish, right around noon, so now you're forewarned

05:31.280 --> 05:35.680
like right around noon, Tuesday, when we have the information, I'll tweet like a link to

05:35.680 --> 05:42.320
a website where you can rush to reserve seats for the Harmon quest.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.320
For the whole audience?

05:43.320 --> 05:45.840
That'll be our whole audience, is that rush?

05:45.840 --> 05:49.000
Well, again, I flatter myself, but I don't think we're going to need more.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.400
If that would be the way to do it, that'd be awesome, as opposed to just having people

05:52.400 --> 05:54.600
that may or may not know exactly what we're doing.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.680
Yeah, no, I don't think we're going to need to go get people out the street, but I do

05:57.680 --> 05:58.680
think we're going to...

05:58.680 --> 05:59.680
Do we know how big the...

05:59.680 --> 06:03.760
I talked to the guy that's producing it, do we know how big the studio audience is

06:03.760 --> 06:04.760
yet?

06:04.760 --> 06:05.760
110 people.

06:05.760 --> 06:06.760
That's great.

06:06.760 --> 06:07.760
Yeah.

06:07.760 --> 06:08.760
Yeah.

06:08.760 --> 06:09.760
We can do that.

06:09.760 --> 06:10.760
We can do that five times.

06:10.760 --> 06:11.760
Of course we can.

06:11.760 --> 06:12.760
Look at him.

06:12.760 --> 06:18.200
But we're also using one of those services, we're doing it through a service that I'm

06:18.200 --> 06:23.160
sure will then go, nope, your fans don't like you, now we'll turn this other valve where

06:23.160 --> 06:29.480
tourists are coming in dressed as lobsters for let's make a deal.

06:29.480 --> 06:32.080
I couldn't get into the prices right, but I guess I'll watch this guy.

06:32.080 --> 06:36.480
It was only the same like two or 300 people that just kept sifting through the whole time

06:36.480 --> 06:37.480
wearing different shirts.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.480
That'd be fine with me.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.480
Yeah, man.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.000
Yeah, no, I have no problem with that.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.120
People can come every show.

06:44.120 --> 06:48.880
What I would like people not to do is just automatically before they figure out that

06:48.880 --> 06:53.760
they can make every show reserve a ticket for every show because that's a ticket we

06:53.760 --> 06:54.760
can't...

06:54.760 --> 06:57.320
Try to split the difference between precaution and...

06:57.320 --> 07:00.680
Because at the same time, we're going to be like 10% overbooking and all that shit,

07:00.680 --> 07:04.560
so there's bull shit going both ways, ain't there?

07:04.560 --> 07:05.560
Yeah.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.480
We're both going to fuck each other over.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.640
Just hit every elevator button in the car.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.320
Why didn't we make the smart move and do all five tapings at Madison Square Garden?

07:16.320 --> 07:18.040
No, we shouldn't.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.360
All right, so moving on.

07:21.360 --> 07:28.440
Festival Supreme, Jack Black's lullapalooza of comedy and music is happening in October.

07:28.440 --> 07:32.840
Harmontown is doing a show, Jeff isn't going to be able to participate, but we're doing

07:32.840 --> 07:34.760
a Harmontown Festival Supreme.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.260
Do we have any detail?

07:36.260 --> 07:42.400
I know we do, but I don't because I don't personally right now.

07:42.400 --> 07:46.200
Does anyone have any details about when our show is for Festival Supreme?

07:46.200 --> 07:47.200
It's October 10th.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.320
Oh, they haven't given us.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.320
They gave Jeff.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.480
No, but I think it's October 10th.

07:51.480 --> 07:56.160
I know that because I think that's the date I found out that I had been booked on a long

07:56.160 --> 07:57.160
time ago.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.160
That makes sense.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.280
But that could be wrong about that, but double check that.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.680
It's the 10th, but we don't have the time yet.

08:02.680 --> 08:03.680
Oh, all right.

08:03.680 --> 08:09.760
Well, I'm out of town no matter what fucking time it is.

08:09.760 --> 08:13.440
I came down a little hard on Steve on that one.

08:13.440 --> 08:18.000
I wish we had a big, see one day I want to move the show to like a big sound stage so

08:18.000 --> 08:26.000
that we can, oh, oh, Mr. Spielberg.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.360
That's nine foot Neil.

08:28.360 --> 08:34.360
I can't see around his pillar because I'm tall.

08:34.360 --> 08:39.240
Nine foot Neil should meet Tay Brickson.

08:39.240 --> 08:46.240
The tallest fan of the show should meet the littlest show promoter.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.240
You see me coaxing you back into Tay Brickson.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.240
Is it Tay or Tay?

08:49.240 --> 08:50.240
I now I forget.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.240
Tay.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.240
Tay Brickson.

08:52.240 --> 08:57.480
Well, we do get bigger, more comfortable digs with room to like create a space that would

08:57.480 --> 09:02.240
like to put Steve Levy in like a little, a little circular research desk.

09:02.240 --> 09:05.000
Oh, so he's our newsroom back there.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Yeah.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.280
He can have like a little internet, like, like, like, like the center and then he can

09:09.280 --> 09:14.160
just like tell me about my calendar and of about like, he can do corrections at the after

09:14.160 --> 09:15.160
the show.

09:15.160 --> 09:16.160
Yeah.

09:16.160 --> 09:19.440
And he could be the one to put through tweets from people that are watching live and we'll

09:19.440 --> 09:23.000
have him up on a screen and then it's, it's, I got big plans.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
That's a great idea.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
It's going to be fun.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
But then they do what it is.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
It's bullshit.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I don't, well, I don't need you.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
You're, you're an original fan.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I don't need you.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Who cares?

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
That's how I felt about the fucking pixies.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Look what they did to me.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
They broke up twice.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.280
You just Donald Trump and they had a big laugh about it.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.280
Death to the pixie.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.280
I love you.

09:48.280 --> 09:51.120
Why are you selling me this shirt?

09:51.120 --> 09:52.120
You're making fun of me.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.400
Is that your dick or your thumb?

09:54.400 --> 09:57.920
That's your thumb.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.280
You are a debaser.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.280
You really are.

10:00.280 --> 10:05.800
It's eight laughs from people with really specific haircuts.

10:05.800 --> 10:06.800
I'm sure.

10:06.800 --> 10:07.800
All right.

10:07.800 --> 10:13.200
So, all right, one, well, speaking of music, I want to do one segment before we bring Kumail

10:13.200 --> 10:19.000
out and then, and then, and then have an open, a potpourri, I call it a, I call it a, a, a,

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
a Kumail.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
A Kumail.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
A Kumail bag.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.520
A Kumail, a Kumail, a Kumail, a Kumail bag is not a bag.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.360
Well, that implies correspondence though.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.360
Yeah, it's like.

10:29.360 --> 10:33.200
I said to him, he texted me that he was going to make the show and I said, cool exclamation

10:33.200 --> 10:37.680
point and then two spaces and then parentheses, male.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.640
And then he, he wrote back an hour later, uh, how about you've got, I don't understand

10:41.640 --> 10:44.240
that, that doesn't sound anything like my name and it's spelled differently.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.920
What about you've got Kumail?

10:46.920 --> 10:47.920
No.

10:47.920 --> 10:48.920
Okay.

10:48.920 --> 10:49.920
That doesn't.

10:49.920 --> 10:50.920
Well, we'll get to that in a second.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.640
But first, I'm going to be, I'm going to think of a 90 worse versions of that.

10:54.640 --> 10:59.000
Here's a segment I call Dan nitpicks, uh, song lyrics.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.880
I like to listen to music and stuff that's it.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.280
It takes a lyrics.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.280
It takes a lyrics.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.120
It's picking the lyrics.

11:12.120 --> 11:18.080
If these were the lyrics to a song, I'd say they were repetitive.

11:18.080 --> 11:23.200
See, I'm not, I'm not immune.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.760
I don't, I don't give myself a pass.

11:24.760 --> 11:31.440
So, uh, this is where I hold the other musicians to the fire, including their feet.

11:31.440 --> 11:36.880
Um, yeah, I mean, I frequently nitpick on lyrics, but I think you and I have both set

11:36.880 --> 11:43.720
around, uh, a drink and, and talked about, you know, Billy Joel's tonic, tonic and gin.

11:43.720 --> 11:44.720
Come on.

11:44.720 --> 11:45.720
Yeah.

11:45.720 --> 11:46.720
Yeah.

11:46.720 --> 11:47.720
That's the thing.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.880
When you're chasing a rhyme, you know, you don't have to rhyme like, like anyways.

11:49.880 --> 11:50.880
So, yeah.

11:50.880 --> 11:51.880
All right.

11:51.880 --> 11:52.880
So here's this song.

11:52.880 --> 11:53.880
It's called highway.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.680
The highway man by the highway men, the highway men, the super group, the country Western

11:57.680 --> 11:58.680
super group.

11:58.680 --> 11:59.680
Waylon Jennings.

11:59.680 --> 12:00.680
Kris Kristofferson.

12:00.680 --> 12:01.680
Waylon Jennings.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.680
Kris Kristofferson.

12:02.680 --> 12:17.080
It's, it's Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson and a, uh, uh, and Willie

12:17.080 --> 12:18.080
Nelson.

12:18.080 --> 12:23.280
Um, uh, the, the, uh, Kris Kristofferson, I think I, I'm going to guess if he's the

12:23.280 --> 12:24.280
one who's taking the verse.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.280
I think he is.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.600
Cause I think I can recognize everyone else's voice.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.360
I think he showed up to this song pretty drunk.

12:28.360 --> 12:29.360
Is that right?

12:29.360 --> 12:31.680
Who goes Johnny Cash goes to space, right?

12:31.680 --> 12:32.680
Yeah.

12:32.680 --> 12:33.680
Yeah.

12:33.680 --> 12:34.680
So, okay.

12:34.680 --> 12:35.680
So this, this song is called the highway man.

12:35.680 --> 12:39.680
It's a country Western super group and they each take a verse and, uh, this is the frustrating

12:39.680 --> 12:44.680
thing about, about these lyrics is how in, I get on board and I'll, I'll walk you through

12:44.680 --> 12:45.680
me getting on board.

12:45.680 --> 12:50.200
It's Willie Nelson starts and says, I was a highway man along the coach roads.

12:50.200 --> 12:54.880
I did ride with sword and pistol by my side.

12:54.880 --> 12:55.880
That's pretty cool.

12:55.880 --> 12:56.880
That's good.

12:56.880 --> 13:01.880
He's often running at that point.

13:01.880 --> 13:02.880
Yeah.

13:02.880 --> 13:09.840
Oh, I'll keep it down if you like.

13:09.840 --> 13:13.640
You're on your own for the rest of this highway man.

13:13.640 --> 13:19.600
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade code, but it's good.

13:19.600 --> 13:22.920
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.

13:22.920 --> 13:23.920
Cool.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.840
The bastard's hug me in the spring of 25.

13:26.840 --> 13:31.840
I don't know what century you're talking about that 1925 is the way we started hanging

13:31.840 --> 13:33.680
the people that ran around the highway with swords.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.120
I feel like I'm going to, I'm going to go 17 or 18.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.120
Yeah.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.640
I think it was just like, but he had to rhyme, but I am still alive.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.640
Okay.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.640
So fine.

13:41.640 --> 13:42.640
Good.

13:42.640 --> 13:47.960
I'm on board cause it sounds like it's about a ghost of a highway man or a timeless figure,

13:47.960 --> 13:49.960
the character that lives through time.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.440
Well, you're, you're way ahead of everything.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.000
It sounds like a ghost from that.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.120
It doesn't sound like a timeless character who lives through everything.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.120
For me, it does.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.120
Cause I've read literature.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.120
No.

14:01.120 --> 14:05.760
It's one, it's one verse of a song I lived in that I was killed in 25, but I'm still

14:05.760 --> 14:06.760
alive.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.760
That's a ghost.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.760
He's got unfinished business.

14:08.760 --> 14:09.760
That's all it is.

14:09.760 --> 14:10.760
It's just a ghost.

14:10.760 --> 14:11.760
A ghost doesn't say I'm still alive.

14:11.760 --> 14:12.760
A ghost says I'm not alive.

14:12.760 --> 14:13.760
I'm a ghost.

14:13.760 --> 14:14.760
Woo.

14:14.760 --> 14:19.320
No, that's, that's a ghost out of cereal box.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.520
I'm a ghost and I love blueberries.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.520
All right.

14:22.520 --> 14:26.280
Look, I've heard this song 19 million times, I might, I might be ahead of the curve on

14:26.280 --> 14:27.280
this song.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.280
I'm sorry.

14:29.280 --> 14:34.320
If ghosts say I'm a ghost, woo, a ghost with Patrick Swayze would have been a terrible,

14:34.320 --> 14:35.320
terrible movie.

14:35.320 --> 14:40.640
He would have woken up after getting shot and he would have gone, I'm a ghost, woo.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.640
And then he never would have, wouldn't it?

14:41.640 --> 14:43.920
But then the ghost and poltergeist said, I'm alive still.

14:43.920 --> 14:44.920
I'm a regular person.

14:44.920 --> 14:47.760
They knew that they knew what they were fucking getting away with.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.760
All right.

14:48.760 --> 14:49.760
Second verse.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.400
The ghost officer comes in, when you listen to the song, you'll hear he's a little, he's

14:52.400 --> 14:54.240
in his cups, as Jeffy would say.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.120
He's a little drunk.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.920
I was a sailor.

14:57.920 --> 15:04.960
I was born upon the tide with the sea I did abide.

15:04.960 --> 15:09.120
I sailed a scooter around the Horn in Mexico.

15:09.120 --> 15:13.360
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.360
Chunky.

15:14.360 --> 15:15.360
In a blow?

15:15.360 --> 15:16.360
In a blow?

15:16.360 --> 15:17.360
I don't, I don't, yeah.

15:17.360 --> 15:22.960
And when the yards broke off, they said, I got killed, but I am living still.

15:22.960 --> 15:23.960
Okay.

15:23.960 --> 15:29.360
So now, as Jeff spoiled, we're talking about a timeless figure here.

15:29.360 --> 15:35.760
Oh, or is it a series of ghosts stepping forward and saying, here's what I was doing.

15:35.760 --> 15:42.000
A tip of my, my cap, my sailor cap and then the ghost synonymous.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.400
And then so I'm assuming this is where you and Jenny comes in.

15:45.400 --> 15:49.680
I was a dam builder across the river, deep and wide.

15:49.680 --> 15:56.440
Where steel and water did collide, a place called Boulder on the wild Colorado.

15:56.440 --> 16:00.440
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below.

16:00.440 --> 16:06.080
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound, but I am still around.

16:06.080 --> 16:11.560
I'll always be around and around and around and around.

16:11.560 --> 16:12.560
They all come in.

16:12.560 --> 16:13.560
Okay.

16:13.560 --> 16:14.560
So I'm like, this is great.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.560
I love this.

16:15.560 --> 16:21.000
And then, and then Johnny Cash comes in and goes, I fly a starship.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.800
This was the seven, the late seventies, early eighties.

16:23.800 --> 16:28.800
If you didn't have a spaceship and a quarter of your shit, you were off the air.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.800
So take it easy on them.

16:30.800 --> 16:35.440
But it's, it's, it's like one of them comes in with a guitar that kind of sounds like

16:35.440 --> 16:36.440
a laser.

16:36.440 --> 16:42.080
Without ruining what you want to get through here, can I stop and can I freeze frame the

16:42.080 --> 16:43.880
first time you heard this recently?

16:43.880 --> 16:44.880
Or is that a while back?

16:44.880 --> 16:47.720
I heard this a while back, but I just, but I like the song that I've heard.

16:47.720 --> 16:51.840
I was listening to it again recently and then my problem lyric is coming up right at the

16:51.840 --> 16:52.840
end.

16:52.840 --> 16:53.840
Right.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.040
So at the point, the first time I heard this song, I was, I heard the song a bunch of times

16:56.040 --> 16:59.080
and never really paid attention to the lyrics as you often do.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.400
Like you hear a song a million times ago.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.000
Oh, I never knew what that song was actually saying.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.280
And this one, the first time I realized that Johnny Cash goes to space, that, that moment

17:06.280 --> 17:07.920
was, was, was, was awesome.

17:07.920 --> 17:08.920
Yeah.

17:08.920 --> 17:12.160
Then this is like, this is before a cloud Atlas, by the way, this song.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.280
I was Tom Hanks.

17:14.280 --> 17:23.760
I was a caveman after the war with Holly Berry in my door, a future rich lady with cures

17:23.760 --> 17:25.880
to my disease.

17:25.880 --> 17:32.400
I talked her into easing my sick son's disease.

17:32.400 --> 17:38.400
And when she explained to me that the human race was a joke, I was still Tom Hanks.

17:38.400 --> 17:47.000
Right, always be Tom Hanks and a Hanks and a Hanks and a Hanks and a Hanks and a Hanks.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
All right.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.360
So anyways, I fly a starship across the universe divide.

17:53.360 --> 18:01.840
And when I reach the other side, I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.640
Perhaps I may become a highway man again.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.640
Oh, shit.

18:06.640 --> 18:07.640
Awesome.

18:07.640 --> 18:11.760
This is the peak of, I'm like, holy shit, he stitched it all together, he is the same

18:11.760 --> 18:12.760
guy.

18:12.760 --> 18:19.320
He's in a starship, he's thinking about being a fucking highway man.

18:19.320 --> 18:32.000
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.360
But I will remain, oh, oh, oh, pick a team.

18:37.360 --> 18:44.000
I'll be back again and again and again and again.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.200
I mean, they weave this macho, like, like, like, like cloud atlas of these guys, like

18:48.200 --> 18:49.200
one guy.

18:49.200 --> 18:53.600
What's the difference between a damn builder and a highway man and a spin and a future

18:53.600 --> 18:59.440
truck driver in space, like we're all, we're all old white men, like, like, like.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.280
And there's something, there's a spiritual connection that unites us all.

19:02.280 --> 19:06.800
But it's like, but I may be a drop of rain, well, me too.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.960
Hey, but a drop of rain, who wants to be a drop of, that's dumb.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.440
A drop of, I may be.

19:12.440 --> 19:16.640
Actually, at Christmas, I've never, I've never noticed that lyric, that is a very disappointing

19:16.640 --> 19:17.640
lyric.

19:17.640 --> 19:21.200
He ruined it, because why is the guy in the starship going, going like, what, who's he

19:21.200 --> 19:22.200
talking to?

19:22.200 --> 19:27.680
Like, he's going like, I fly a starship, look out for that asteroid, you know, I got this

19:27.680 --> 19:33.280
weird feeling, I was a highway man in a past life, so when I die, I'll probably come back

19:33.280 --> 19:38.960
as a highway man, but fuck it, you know, I may, it may be just general Buddhist shit.

19:38.960 --> 19:46.000
I mean, the space man is the most, because you're seeing stars and fucking planets and

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
shit.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.280
If you're ever a drop of rain, it's when you're flying through space.

19:51.280 --> 19:54.760
Or is he saying that, no, there's no rain in space.

19:54.760 --> 20:02.000
No, but I mean, he's like, he's, he's, I mean, he's only a drop of rain, he's so minuscule

20:02.000 --> 20:05.240
in, even in comparison to the whole of rain.

20:05.240 --> 20:09.600
Okay, yeah, you're saying how infinitesimally small is my existence.

20:09.600 --> 20:17.320
He's a soul, he's like a cycle of souls in a cycle of, of a rain of souls.

20:17.320 --> 20:24.560
That keeps going, like it's like the water, you know, like, it's kind of cool.

20:24.560 --> 20:30.280
He's also saying that, like, I may come back again, and yeah, exactly, if I come back again

20:30.280 --> 20:33.800
and I keep doing this, like, it will either be as one of these, one of these, one of these

20:33.800 --> 20:36.360
people, a human being, or, or a drop of water.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.360
Well, I don't know, it's like metaphorical.

20:38.360 --> 20:43.560
It's like, the soul cycle is like rain, and he's like, just part of all of these souls

20:43.560 --> 20:47.400
in these internal cycles talking about how they used to be highwaymen.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.280
But if he's going to use a metaphor, then the whole song should be called drops of rain.

20:51.280 --> 20:56.520
And then it should be like, one drop of rain I was, was called a highwayman.

20:56.520 --> 21:00.040
Here's another example of a kind of rain I was.

21:00.040 --> 21:04.720
I was a drop of rain named Ralph from Colorado.

21:04.720 --> 21:10.560
I slipped ironically on real rain and fell below.

21:10.560 --> 21:17.400
These are all lives, and there is pointless as the rain, but each drop will remain until

21:17.400 --> 21:22.680
it evaporates again and again and again.

21:22.680 --> 21:31.440
But he does say, I go across the universe divide, and when I get to the other side,

21:31.440 --> 21:37.960
that implies like when he's dead, right, when he, when I actually go to whatever the afterlife

21:37.960 --> 21:46.000
for a possibly a cyclic, like a karmic traveler goes to, maybe I find out, maybe I'm nothing,

21:46.000 --> 21:49.360
maybe that was all pointless, maybe, maybe I'm just one of these stars in this endless

21:49.360 --> 21:51.600
space that we look at, like Spencer said.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.880
I think it's cool.

21:53.880 --> 21:57.560
I thought it was dumb until it got resolved where he'd still remain, and it'll be like,

21:57.560 --> 21:58.560
oh, it's a metaphor.

21:58.560 --> 22:04.360
I don't like when people say rain and rhyme again and again, because firstly it was highwaymen

22:04.360 --> 22:05.360
and again.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.360
They said again, like we say again.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.520
You didn't get to change a game.

22:10.520 --> 22:13.320
Yeah, I like that all the guys are there.

22:13.320 --> 22:14.320
It's a human song.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.640
It's not a song about the fucking cosmology.

22:16.640 --> 22:23.760
It's about, it's about four different like little shapes of loner.

22:23.760 --> 22:31.320
It's like, just because you're born in a time when a man with integrity didn't even have

22:31.320 --> 22:35.640
the option of being a cattle rustler or a highwayman, doesn't mean that while you're

22:35.640 --> 22:40.880
welding a rivet on a dam, when you're built, something is silly, it's like, I'm not a cowboy.

22:40.880 --> 22:45.400
I'm not a spaceman when I'm welding this dam, but it's like, it's four different guys going

22:45.400 --> 22:52.080
like, I was a country western archetype, and then I died, but I didn't die because they're

22:52.080 --> 22:53.080
all me.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.080
Well, connect it.

22:54.080 --> 22:58.720
It's important to me that that guy be like a guy with, you know, it's a guy.

22:58.720 --> 23:03.680
It's about a guy's relationship with the cosmos, not about mapping the cosmos itself and going

23:03.680 --> 23:09.400
like, you see those ants down there, one of those ants could be me, and the green's a

23:09.400 --> 23:12.680
sand upon the beach.

23:12.680 --> 23:13.680
Why not that?

23:13.680 --> 23:14.680
Why isn't that?

23:14.680 --> 23:15.680
That's not a song.

23:15.680 --> 23:18.280
That's like something you'd hear in an incense store.

23:18.280 --> 23:21.200
That's not something you'd listen to when you're drinking a glass of scotch, and you're

23:21.200 --> 23:24.680
like, yeah, my dad was a fucking spaceman, and I'm going to...

23:24.680 --> 23:29.400
Sorry, are you upset that this song isn't country enough for you, that it goes into the hippie

23:29.400 --> 23:32.040
cosmological, metaphysical at the very end?

23:32.040 --> 23:34.360
I don't like going from...

23:34.360 --> 23:38.360
When I get to the other side, which is like, Tolkien asks, like, the elves going across,

23:38.360 --> 23:40.600
there's like, I'm a person, and I have a...

23:40.600 --> 23:42.600
I thought you didn't like Tolkien, I thought.

23:42.600 --> 23:43.600
I don't like Tolkien.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.600
I don't like those elves, man.

23:44.600 --> 23:45.600
That's enough.

23:45.600 --> 23:49.680
How do you just turn off your mortality by going on a fucking boat?

23:49.680 --> 23:52.360
What the shit is that?

23:52.360 --> 23:53.360
Thanks, Steve.

23:53.360 --> 23:57.760
Well, now what we're finding out is you'd like it if as they got right off the shore,

23:57.760 --> 23:59.560
they all turned into rain.

23:59.560 --> 24:00.760
Well, I'm just...

24:00.760 --> 24:05.160
If I was observing my life over millennia cycling, and cycling, and cycling, I might

24:05.160 --> 24:09.640
have the thought that shit, maybe millions of other people are doing the same thing,

24:09.640 --> 24:14.200
and that's also kind of interesting, but only worth a passing mention.

24:14.200 --> 24:19.200
I will agree, Dan, that I don't think that the song Highwaymen succeeds in doing what

24:19.200 --> 24:21.800
it tries to...

24:21.800 --> 24:26.040
It fumbles on the goal line a little bit, of the goal line they're trying to cross.

24:26.040 --> 24:30.400
It's like, this is a giant metaphysical thing going on.

24:30.400 --> 24:35.960
I get what they're going for, but it doesn't quite succeed in either way.

24:35.960 --> 24:36.960
That's been...

24:36.960 --> 24:46.320
Highwaymen lyrics, you've been nitpicked.

24:46.320 --> 24:54.560
It's a good song, though.

24:54.560 --> 25:04.440
Hello, hello.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.560
Is Alan Woo coming, or what?

25:06.560 --> 25:09.560
Alan Wu is actually directing Harmon Quest.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.560
Oh, and he's not here.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.560
People at home who aren't watching video,

25:13.560 --> 25:16.560
there's a seat very ostentatiously reserved in the front row

25:16.560 --> 25:19.560
that says, reserved Alan Wu on it.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.560
Yeah, it's like that.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.560
The only empty seat here, and it's the one guy here

25:23.560 --> 25:25.560
that's directing Harmon Quest.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.560
Maybe he's running around the back of this house

25:27.560 --> 25:30.560
holding up his fingers like the camera frame thing.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.560
Like he's, you know...

25:32.560 --> 25:34.560
Dan, can I say something?

25:34.560 --> 25:36.560
Yeah, you can do on that song.

25:36.560 --> 25:38.560
These guys are, you guys are working too hard

25:38.560 --> 25:40.560
to make sense of something.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.560
It makes sense.

25:42.560 --> 25:45.560
Can I say, I wrote down this quote you said, Spencer.

25:45.560 --> 25:48.560
First off, Camille, I didn't say it made sense.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.560
I've come down to the side, I get where they're going.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.560
I don't think they nail it.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.560
And I think Dan's right in saying,

25:55.560 --> 25:57.560
if they just stuck to a song about,

25:57.560 --> 25:59.560
there's the archetype of the loner

25:59.560 --> 26:01.560
that goes on through time,

26:01.560 --> 26:04.560
and that will always be as we go on through the cosmos.

26:04.560 --> 26:07.560
I think they could have done either or and made it better.

26:07.560 --> 26:08.560
Well, I think it's...

26:08.560 --> 26:10.560
Well, this is what Spencer said.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.560
What did I say?

26:11.560 --> 26:13.560
Spencer said, if you're ever a drop of rain,

26:13.560 --> 26:15.560
it's when you're flying through space

26:15.560 --> 26:17.560
and everyone here nodded like, yeah,

26:17.560 --> 26:20.560
that's true, Spencer.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.560
I think it's funny that it's Johnny Cash's,

26:23.560 --> 26:26.560
they all clearly wrote their own verses,

26:26.560 --> 26:28.560
and they're like, I'm going to be a damn builder.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.560
I'm going to be a boatman.

26:30.560 --> 26:33.560
Johnny Cash is like, I'm going to drive a spaceship.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.560
I'm not sure about that.

26:35.560 --> 26:38.560
If I had my guess, this is totally a guess,

26:38.560 --> 26:40.560
and we will verify this later on.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.560
I'll look it up later.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.560
My guess is that Kristofferson wrote the whole thing.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.560
Or one other person wrote the whole thing.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.560
It seems to me so different that,

26:48.560 --> 26:50.560
because he's the biggest star, Johnny Cash.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.560
I bet that at a meeting where they're like,

26:52.560 --> 26:54.560
well, we've got to have Johnny Cash.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.560
If he's going to be a spaceman, we'll put him at the end.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.560
Hopefully people will stop paying attention to the lyrics by then.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.560
We're all collaborators through so much of their careers.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.560
Yeah, and I will also interject there

27:03.560 --> 27:05.560
that at this particular point in time,

27:05.560 --> 27:08.560
that Willie Nelson could have been the big gun.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.560
It depends from year to year.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.560
Johnny Cash went through a heavy period of time where,

27:14.560 --> 27:17.560
it's like the way we thought about Roy Orbison

27:17.560 --> 27:19.560
and when the Traveling Wool Bears have,

27:19.560 --> 27:21.560
it's like, well, there's Roy Orbison.

27:21.560 --> 27:24.560
But then Johnny Cash got co-opted by hipsters.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.560
He's like the hipster.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.560
That was recently.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.560
God damn it.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.560
The fucking damn it.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.560
Raindrop.

27:34.560 --> 27:38.560
Oh, the rhyme scheme is actually pretty sophisticated.

27:38.560 --> 27:41.560
So it's like, I don't know if you gave them each a verse.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.560
I don't know.

27:43.560 --> 27:47.560
It's weird. The sailor one is kind of fucking mouthful.

27:47.560 --> 27:50.560
I heard the furlum furlum furlum.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.560
I heard the furlum furlum.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.560
That sounds like Kris Kristofferson.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.560
Yeah, I don't know.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.560
I don't know if it was like an emcee thing

27:58.560 --> 28:00.560
where they came in with it written on their hand

28:00.560 --> 28:02.560
and they're like, I was a plumber.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.560
And it was like, fuck, this is supposed to be an epic song.

28:05.560 --> 28:08.560
I plunged the shit out of the crap.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.560
The shit out of the crap.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.560
I sorted it upon my lap.

28:13.560 --> 28:17.560
I found the peanuts, distinguished turds from diarrhea.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.560
And then they were like, well, we got to put someone in a spaceship

28:20.560 --> 28:22.560
to balance this out.

28:22.560 --> 28:25.560
I do remember probably in my teens or 20s

28:25.560 --> 28:28.560
being disappointed when they changed again to a gain.

28:28.560 --> 28:31.560
And I hate when songs make it a gain.

28:31.560 --> 28:33.560
That's dumb.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.560
Yeah.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.560
Or when they backward sing.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.560
We talked about too, when they do Yoda speak,

28:39.560 --> 28:41.560
just to make the rhyme.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.560
Oh, that's the worst.

28:43.560 --> 28:46.560
What's a good example of that when somebody's like...

28:46.560 --> 28:51.560
And my love you will have...

28:51.560 --> 28:53.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.560
Tonic and gin.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.560
Tonic and gin.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.560
My love you will have.

28:59.560 --> 29:03.560
All right, so we watched Nightmare on Elm Street 2 this weekend.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.560
And one.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.560
We watched one because of Wes Craven passing

29:07.560 --> 29:09.560
and we thought we'd honor him again.

29:09.560 --> 29:11.560
And again.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.560
And again.

29:13.560 --> 29:16.560
I want to beat that lyric before I move on.

29:16.560 --> 29:23.560
My belt is buckled with the topaz of my pain.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.560
I don't know.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.560
You got to bring it back to a country western thing

29:27.560 --> 29:29.560
like a belt buckle or a beer bottle or something.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.560
I love the topaz of my pain.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.560
Topaz of my pain.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.560
Or not topaz. What's the other thing?

29:35.560 --> 29:37.560
No, no, no. Turquoise, turquoise.

29:37.560 --> 29:40.560
My belt is buckled with the turquoise of my pain.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.560
But I'll be back.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.560
No, that would be dumb.

29:44.560 --> 29:48.560
I don't think Johnny Cash ever said the word turquoise in his life.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.560
Okay.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.560
Nightmare on Elm Street, we watched it.

29:52.560 --> 29:55.560
So then we thought, let's just watch Nightmare on Elm Street 2

29:55.560 --> 29:57.560
because we kept talking about what we were watching.

29:57.560 --> 30:02.560
Camille was there and Schrab and Emily and Agee.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.560
And holy cats.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.560
Nightmare on Elm Street 2.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.560
It's super gay.

30:08.560 --> 30:13.560
There's no fear of that sounding like a homophobic or inaccurate statement.

30:13.560 --> 30:16.560
It is one of the gayest movies that's ever been made.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.560
It's gay as fuck.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.560
And it's kind of beautifully gay.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.560
It's not even that pornographically gay.

30:22.560 --> 30:28.560
There is some prurient, externalized gay things about it.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.560
There's a lot of people taking their shirts off and doing push-ups together.

30:31.560 --> 30:37.560
But the thing that really makes it gay is the gay love, the relationship.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.560
The two guys.

30:38.560 --> 30:41.560
And there's a part where they're both fighting and one guy pulls his pants down

30:41.560 --> 30:44.560
and the fight continues with just one guy's butt out.

30:44.560 --> 30:45.560
Yeah.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.560
There's a lot of that kind of stuff.

30:47.560 --> 30:48.560
Well, it's the equivalent.

30:48.560 --> 30:52.560
Today it would be looked at as totally progressive because there's a girl in the movie

30:52.560 --> 30:58.560
but there's not an inch of skin outside her arms or collarbone exposed.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.560
She's just sort of like a regular person.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.560
And she doesn't get in any pillow fights or have any friends.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.560
But the guys have friends that pull each other's pants down and roll around

31:06.560 --> 31:08.560
and they're all hunky and stuff.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.560
Is it never acknowledged that they speak about this?

31:10.560 --> 31:11.560
Just really talk about it.

31:11.560 --> 31:14.560
It's just from like an alternate universe where like men are objectified.

31:14.560 --> 31:19.560
Well, what they do keep talking about is how one of them...

31:19.560 --> 31:22.560
A lonely clap in the back of the room.

31:22.560 --> 31:27.560
What they do keep talking about because that's the one where Freddie is inside the kid

31:27.560 --> 31:31.560
and so the whole movie is about a kid.

31:31.560 --> 31:35.560
It's about a kid going to be misunderstood by people and going like,

31:35.560 --> 31:37.560
I don't know who I am.

31:37.560 --> 31:41.560
And according to Schrab, the writer actually in an interview said,

31:41.560 --> 31:49.560
yes, I was thinking of this as a metaphor for being young and figuring out that you're gay.

31:49.560 --> 31:54.560
But he didn't expect the director to then take it and then double down on it.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.560
The writers often have...

31:56.560 --> 31:59.560
My original writing mentor, when I was writing Monster House,

31:59.560 --> 32:02.560
one of the first pieces of advice he gave me is he said,

32:02.560 --> 32:04.560
and I don't know if this is...

32:04.560 --> 32:08.560
Maybe I'm betraying this? Am I going to be like Bruce Lee teaching people kung fu?

32:08.560 --> 32:11.560
And now, yeah, because now everybody knows kung fu.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.560
That's why they never wanted it to get out.

32:20.560 --> 32:23.560
Yeah. Oh, fuck.

32:23.560 --> 32:27.560
You got fucking Jackie Chan running around.

32:27.560 --> 32:29.560
He said every...

32:29.560 --> 32:31.560
Screenwriters always have a secret.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.560
They have a secret about the movie.

32:33.560 --> 32:36.560
You try to be transparent in all your work,

32:36.560 --> 32:41.560
like get your own head on paper and be really clear about things and passionate.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.560
But then there's one little exception to that,

32:43.560 --> 32:46.560
which is the writer should know something that nobody else knows.

32:46.560 --> 32:50.560
Like the basketball in Monster House is DJ's puberty.

32:50.560 --> 32:54.560
It's just boyhood bouncing over to the house or something like that.

32:54.560 --> 32:57.560
I think that was me phoning in, like his advice,

32:57.560 --> 33:01.560
okay, it's his puberty, I'll keep that a secret.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.560
But so anyways, that writer was like...

33:04.560 --> 33:07.560
That actually makes a lot of sense.

33:07.560 --> 33:11.560
Yeah, it goes in and it's him becoming a grown-up

33:11.560 --> 33:15.560
and having to deal with grown-up shit like a fucking monster house.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.560
It's true. Well done.

33:17.560 --> 33:22.560
Like a mortgage, when your property is who you are.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.560
As opposed to being a kid's trick or treat,

33:25.560 --> 33:28.560
they go and they take what they want from the grown-ups.

33:28.560 --> 33:33.560
Like they're communists and parents are capitalists and the basketball is...

33:33.560 --> 33:35.560
So he's going from communism to capitalism.

33:35.560 --> 33:37.560
Which is going from boyhood to adulthood.

33:37.560 --> 33:38.560
Yeah.

33:38.560 --> 33:39.560
Wow.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.560
Because communism is not viable.

33:42.560 --> 33:46.560
That should have been the tagline for the movie.

33:46.560 --> 33:47.560
Communism is not viable.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.560
Communism is not viable.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.560
Monster house.

33:51.560 --> 33:52.560
What?

33:52.560 --> 33:56.560
Who's this for?

33:56.560 --> 33:58.560
The bourgeoisie is the monster.

33:58.560 --> 33:59.560
All right.

33:59.560 --> 34:00.560
So yeah.

34:00.560 --> 34:05.560
Well, because one of the most interesting things is that on Friday the 13th,

34:05.560 --> 34:07.560
Nightmare on Elm Street part one,

34:07.560 --> 34:11.560
the girl is a typical kind of scream queen.

34:11.560 --> 34:14.560
She's being stalked by this Freddie guy.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.560
She goes to Johnny Depp and she says,

34:17.560 --> 34:21.560
I have this idea, like watch me sleep and then wake me up

34:21.560 --> 34:22.560
and I'm going to try to grab Freddie.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.560
That whole thing is played out in this movie as well.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.560
But he goes to the guy's house.

34:26.560 --> 34:30.560
The guy crawls in the window of another hunky guy's bedroom

34:30.560 --> 34:33.560
and wakes him up and he's wearing this midriff shirt.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.560
He's like, what's going on, Taylor?

34:36.560 --> 34:38.560
And it's like, listen, I really need to talk to you.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.560
But the girl is in the movie.

34:40.560 --> 34:43.560
That's not who he takes his problems to.

34:43.560 --> 34:46.560
And he tells him, I want you to wake me up.

34:46.560 --> 34:49.560
It's a total rom-com because they start out enemies

34:49.560 --> 34:51.560
and then they become really close.

34:51.560 --> 34:52.560
Yeah.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.560
That's great.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.560
I love them.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.560
And they're not constantly calling each other fag

34:57.560 --> 34:58.560
or anything like that.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.560
There was a lot of stuff in the 80s where it was like,

35:00.560 --> 35:03.560
oh, you're like guys bullying each other for being,

35:03.560 --> 35:06.560
like calling each other homo while they beat them up.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.560
But then in that same scene, it's like,

35:08.560 --> 35:11.560
oh, the water is glistening off of my pecs.

35:11.560 --> 35:14.560
And that's what you expect from the 80s.

35:14.560 --> 35:17.560
But this was more of just a gay love story.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.560
And it was kind of on the sleeve,

35:19.560 --> 35:22.560
on the rolled up fluorescent sleeve.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.560
Because we were talking through it,

35:24.560 --> 35:27.560
but there's nothing really homophobic that happens in it.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.560
I just said that.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.560
Moving on.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.560
Right.

35:30.560 --> 35:34.560
I feel like this is from your leftover high women aggression

35:34.560 --> 35:36.560
that's being taken out of me now.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.560
I don't think I was ever aggressive about high women.

35:38.560 --> 35:42.560
I felt that we found some common ground on high women.

35:42.560 --> 35:46.560
I feel like you're bringing some sort of weird

35:46.560 --> 35:49.560
non-street three rage on me right now that I don't,

35:49.560 --> 35:50.560
I don't understand.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.560
My burn on street three is a really good one.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.560
That's where their dream warriors,

35:54.560 --> 35:56.560
and they each have a dream power.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.560
See, the only thing I know about,

35:58.560 --> 36:00.560
I've never seen anything movies,

36:00.560 --> 36:03.560
the only thing I know about those movies is that Don Dawkins

36:03.560 --> 36:05.560
did the soundtrack for it.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.560
It was all Dawkins songs, right?

36:07.560 --> 36:09.560
I don't know who that is.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.560
He was a rock and roller.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.560
Yeah, well also do yourself a favor and load up the fat boys,

36:14.560 --> 36:16.560
the fat boys are running around the house.

36:16.560 --> 36:17.560
And we talked about this,

36:17.560 --> 36:19.560
our favorite part is that they're being chased by Freddie,

36:19.560 --> 36:22.560
but they're still fine time for donuts in the video.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.560
Oh yeah, they're like, oh my god, there's food.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.560
But then Freddie is rapping a lot.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.560
He's not like just the bridge in the rap.

36:28.560 --> 36:29.560
He like starts the rap.

36:29.560 --> 36:32.560
He's like, my name is Freddie Krueger,

36:32.560 --> 36:33.560
and I'm here to say.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.560
But he really says that.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.560
Is that the Will Smith one?

36:36.560 --> 36:38.560
Because he also did a thing with Will Smith.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.560
Will Smith has one, but Freddie's not in that one.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.560
It's just Will Smith talking about Freddie.

36:42.560 --> 36:43.560
Oh, he doesn't have like a bridge?

36:43.560 --> 36:45.560
I don't think Freddie shows up in the Will Smith one.

36:45.560 --> 36:46.560
Oh, okay.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.560
But he does say my name is Freddie Krueger,

36:48.560 --> 36:50.560
and I'm here to say, like in the fat boys one.

36:50.560 --> 36:51.560
Is he really?

36:51.560 --> 36:52.560
Yeah, he really does.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.560
You I Will Slay.

36:53.560 --> 36:54.560
Yeah, you I Will Slay.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.560
Yoda talk.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.560
Force that rhyme, Freddie.

36:57.560 --> 36:59.560
All right.

36:59.560 --> 37:02.560
It's like Bobby Brown's rap and Ghostbusters too.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.560
My man Vigo, the master of evil.

37:05.560 --> 37:08.560
Vigo and evil now.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.560
That's like again and again.

37:10.560 --> 37:14.560
I like when they you have like raps at the end and like recap the whole movie.

37:14.560 --> 37:15.560
Yeah.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.560
I'm all for that.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.560
Yeah.

37:17.560 --> 37:18.560
Ninja Turtles has that.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.560
You're like, who's because I just saw the movie.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.560
You don't need to recap it.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.560
Is it for people who come in at the credits?

37:24.560 --> 37:25.560
Like what did I miss?

37:25.560 --> 37:26.560
Oh, okay.

37:26.560 --> 37:27.560
Yeah.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.560
But nowadays like the Disney and Pixar movies,

37:29.560 --> 37:31.560
they have all those little Easter eggs for the credits.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.560
I would be very happy if there was a rap at the end of every movie.

37:33.560 --> 37:34.560
Yeah.

37:34.560 --> 37:35.560
No, I loved it too.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.560
I always feel bad for the rapper.

37:37.560 --> 37:41.560
Like I feel like like it wasn't his idea to like rap about ghostbusting.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.560
Like I just feel like he's like in front of the microphone,

37:43.560 --> 37:47.560
like like seeing the ghost of his dad like shaking his head.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.560
Cause he's like.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.560
Cause his dad wanted it to be.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.560
When Spock came in with the lasers.

37:52.560 --> 37:54.560
Yo, that wasn't Tazers.

37:54.560 --> 37:58.560
I'm like a Mac Daddy, but you know, I got the lasers.

37:58.560 --> 38:02.560
And then he looks over at his dad's like.

38:02.560 --> 38:03.560
What about the-

38:03.560 --> 38:06.560
Boy, you used to rap about selling cocaine.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.560
Yeah.

38:07.560 --> 38:12.560
Not rhyming lasers with tasers and lasers.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.560
You could have said phasers.

38:13.560 --> 38:16.560
But pop phasers was right there.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.560
That's the only thing that's in Star Trek.

38:19.560 --> 38:20.560
Yeah.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.560
They don't have tasers.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.560
I was, I was trying to do double duty where I was like,

38:24.560 --> 38:27.560
trying to rap like a rapper that hasn't seen Star Trek.

38:27.560 --> 38:28.560
I was rapping about Star Trek.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.560
Freddie Cooper has lasers.

38:30.560 --> 38:31.560
Well, that's it.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.560
Come on.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.560
Let's not.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.560
This is not that segment's over.

38:35.560 --> 38:38.560
I'm nitpicking my improv lyrics.

38:38.560 --> 38:39.560
Okay.

38:39.560 --> 38:40.560
New segment.

38:40.560 --> 38:41.560
It's called Sperm Count Questions.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.560
Sperm Count Questions.

38:42.560 --> 38:49.560
Sperm Count, you hear it a lot, but what do you do?

38:49.560 --> 38:51.560
What do you got here, Sperm?

38:51.560 --> 38:53.560
And it's being counted.

38:53.560 --> 39:01.560
Oh, Sperm Count Questions.

39:01.560 --> 39:07.560
I got Sperm Count Questions.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.560
Will you come home tonight?

39:09.560 --> 39:17.560
I got a Sperm Count Questions.

39:17.560 --> 39:21.560
Yeah, yeah, because, yeah.

39:21.560 --> 39:25.560
Dan, this is not a note, but sometimes you give me a look like you want me to kill the music.

39:25.560 --> 39:26.560
You give me that kind of like.

39:26.560 --> 39:27.560
Oh, okay.

39:27.560 --> 39:28.560
No, I won't do it.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.560
I'll give you the out and the music and then you go on.

39:31.560 --> 39:32.560
Oh, we should have a signal.

39:32.560 --> 39:33.560
Uh-huh.

39:33.560 --> 39:34.560
Oh, I see.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.560
Now, I thought you were saying and out.

39:36.560 --> 39:37.560
Oh, no, no, no.

39:37.560 --> 39:38.560
Okay.

39:38.560 --> 39:39.560
So I thought.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.560
No, I'm just doing, I'm just going off your lead.

39:41.560 --> 39:42.560
I don't want to have a signal.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.560
I want this to be a fluid thing.

39:44.560 --> 39:45.560
Okay.

39:45.560 --> 39:46.560
Usually it really is.

39:46.560 --> 39:50.560
You guys, I'm always amazed that you know when to cut the music out.

39:50.560 --> 39:51.560
Right.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.560
But sometimes I blow it all the way.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.560
It's a fluid thing.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.560
All right.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.560
Sperm Count Questions.

39:57.560 --> 40:00.560
Do we ask you Sperm Count Questions or do you have Sperm Count Questions for us?

40:00.560 --> 40:01.560
I have Sperm Count Questions.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.560
Okay.

40:02.560 --> 40:03.560
Oh, okay.

40:03.560 --> 40:04.560
I have one question.

40:04.560 --> 40:05.560
What?

40:05.560 --> 40:06.560
What's a good number?

40:06.560 --> 40:07.560
Okay.

40:07.560 --> 40:08.560
80, 80.

40:08.560 --> 40:09.560
80?

40:09.560 --> 40:10.560
No, I don't know.

40:10.560 --> 40:11.560
80, 80.

40:11.560 --> 40:12.560
It's like for what?

40:12.560 --> 40:13.560
80, 80.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.560
It's 80, 80.

40:14.560 --> 40:15.560
Oh yeah.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.560
My Sperm's an 80, 80, bro.

40:16.560 --> 40:17.560
I'm good.

40:17.560 --> 40:19.560
You got 80 Sperms out of 80.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.560
Possibility to get Sperms.

40:20.560 --> 40:21.560
Yeah.

40:21.560 --> 40:22.560
I got 80 out of 80 possible Sperms.

40:22.560 --> 40:23.560
Okay.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.280
So here's the thing about Sperm Count.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.280
Here's the theory.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.280
Okay.

40:27.280 --> 40:33.480
So I come and then there's some sperm and then you take a needle and then you're like,

40:33.480 --> 40:39.960
you have some sample size like a cubic micron or whatever the fuck it is and then you go

40:39.960 --> 40:40.960
in and you-

40:40.960 --> 40:41.960
You're doing this?

40:41.960 --> 40:42.960
No, I'm not doing it.

40:42.960 --> 40:43.960
Okay.

40:43.960 --> 40:44.960
Sorry.

40:44.960 --> 40:45.960
A spermologist is doing it.

40:45.960 --> 40:46.960
Whatever the people that count your sperm.

40:46.960 --> 40:53.120
So as far as I understand it, the idea is that what it is, it's like a ratio to amount

40:53.120 --> 40:54.120
of fluid.

40:54.120 --> 40:55.120
Right?

40:55.120 --> 40:56.120
I would assume so.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.120
Okay.

40:57.120 --> 41:01.320
How much, I think it's density of usable shit in the ejaculate.

41:01.320 --> 41:03.480
I would think it's like the sperm and not the semen.

41:03.480 --> 41:04.480
Right.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.480
What is this gesture?

41:05.480 --> 41:06.480
Wait, wait, wait.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.480
You know, it's the sperm.

41:08.480 --> 41:09.480
A gentleman's raising his hand over here.

41:09.480 --> 41:10.480
Do you know the answer to this?

41:10.480 --> 41:11.480
We do know the answer.

41:11.480 --> 41:13.480
It's not like how many you have.

41:13.480 --> 41:14.480
Can you get up and grab a microphone?

41:14.480 --> 41:15.480
Yeah.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.480
You'll have to come up and talk about sperm.

41:16.480 --> 41:17.480
Sorry.

41:17.480 --> 41:23.480
Sperm Count answers.

41:23.480 --> 41:26.240
The same thing happens in Nightmare on Elm Street part two.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.920
There's this whole scene in the biology class.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.240
I just spent 20 minutes talking about it right now.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.240
Sorry.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.240
What's your name, young man?

41:32.240 --> 41:33.240
Who have you been up here before?

41:33.240 --> 41:34.240
I have.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.240
It's Scoota.

41:35.240 --> 41:36.240
Scoota.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.240
Oh.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.240
How can I forget?

41:38.240 --> 41:39.240
Shit.

41:39.240 --> 41:40.240
How do you spell it?

41:40.240 --> 41:41.240
S-K-U-T-A.

41:41.240 --> 41:42.240
Okay.

41:42.240 --> 41:43.240
Yeah.

41:43.240 --> 41:44.240
All right.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.240
Scoota.

41:45.240 --> 41:46.240
So I don't know why, but I learned it recently, I believe.

41:46.240 --> 41:50.360
So the sperm count, you have like the sample, and then they have like a, I don't know if

41:50.360 --> 41:55.640
they use real eggs or not, but what they count is how many make it to the egg.

41:55.640 --> 41:56.640
Wait.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.640
Really?

41:57.640 --> 41:59.140
Like in a simulated waystrap?

41:59.140 --> 42:02.040
How many viable sperm make it through an actual egg?

42:02.040 --> 42:03.040
Right.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.040
Yeah.

42:04.040 --> 42:07.440
Like some, like, sometimes like alcohol use or some drug use makes your sperm like kind

42:07.440 --> 42:08.440
of lazy.

42:08.440 --> 42:09.440
Sure.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.440
Tell me about it.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.440
Wait.

42:11.440 --> 42:12.440
Scoota.

42:12.440 --> 42:13.440
Wait.

42:13.440 --> 42:14.440
So you'd have like a smaller count because less would make it to the egg.

42:14.440 --> 42:15.440
Okay.

42:15.440 --> 42:17.000
Well, where is the egg that they're using in the counting?

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Like what?

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
I don't know.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
It's a lady.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
It's Martha.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
It's Martha.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.500
It's also the same lady.

42:23.500 --> 42:24.800
It's the same lady for all of us.

42:24.800 --> 42:25.800
It's one lady.

42:25.800 --> 42:26.800
She's old now.

42:26.800 --> 42:29.800
She just has a window in her, in her like ovaries.

42:29.800 --> 42:30.800
Yeah.

42:30.800 --> 42:31.800
They're like, one, two.

42:31.800 --> 42:36.000
She's like a cow at the state fair that you can watch grass digest with this like, they

42:36.000 --> 42:39.880
put, they put, they put semen and then they come, it will be back at six hours, Gloria.

42:39.880 --> 42:40.880
And she's like, okay.

42:40.880 --> 42:47.000
She puts on headphones and it's like, I don't know what song it's playing.

42:47.000 --> 42:53.640
I was a highway man, drop of rain.

42:53.640 --> 42:56.560
But then they come back in and they, and they, I mean, seriously, come on.

42:56.560 --> 42:59.000
There's like, well, now this is, this raises 90 more questions.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
How do you count?

43:00.000 --> 43:04.280
Scoota, you're saying they're using actual viable eggs and creating a situation where

43:04.280 --> 43:08.720
the sperm, they would find out how much, yeah, they basically, it's like the active sperm

43:08.720 --> 43:12.480
you have versus bullshit, deadbeat, never going to make it right.

43:12.480 --> 43:18.040
So they do, I guess, organize a race and they see how many make the finish line.

43:18.040 --> 43:19.040
Sperm race.

43:19.040 --> 43:20.040
Yeah.

43:20.040 --> 43:22.760
Well, all of my questions about sperm powder have to do with how they do it.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.360
So I mean, that's an interesting answer, but it doesn't.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.360
Can anybody else verify or deny?

43:26.360 --> 43:27.360
Is it like a maze?

43:27.360 --> 43:28.360
What's your name?

43:28.360 --> 43:29.360
Michael.

43:29.360 --> 43:30.360
Michael, get the fuck up here.

43:30.360 --> 43:33.840
Michael knows more sperm answers.

43:33.840 --> 43:39.280
Welcome to Sperm and Town.

43:39.280 --> 43:40.280
How's it going?

43:40.280 --> 43:42.320
Also, I could have Googled it.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.320
No.

43:43.320 --> 43:45.720
I think we both read the same Reddit post.

43:45.720 --> 43:46.720
Scoota.

43:46.720 --> 43:47.720
Yeah.

43:47.720 --> 43:51.520
There was a post recently about how when you smoke marijuana, it makes your sperm have

43:51.520 --> 43:52.520
less motility.

43:52.520 --> 43:54.400
So they get lazy.

43:54.400 --> 44:00.000
And so how they measure it is just like literally watch them move and they travel away from

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
a point.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.440
So they just look at them on a microscope and they literally just measure the distance.

44:03.440 --> 44:04.440
They pick a radius.

44:04.440 --> 44:05.440
Yeah.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.440
It's like, and they don't care what direction they go.

44:07.440 --> 44:08.440
Yeah.

44:08.440 --> 44:09.440
It's just like, oh, they went pretty far.

44:09.440 --> 44:10.440
Okay.

44:10.440 --> 44:31.480
But okay, so let's say I come onto a microscope slide with a picture of a redhead on it.

44:31.480 --> 44:35.640
You put it under the microscope and now you see, well, you're going to see like a random

44:35.640 --> 44:41.120
number of sperm, they have to like, do they have a set number?

44:41.120 --> 44:42.920
So is the sperm count?

44:42.920 --> 44:48.120
I always thought the count was the amount of sperm at a zoa per, like, per sample.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.120
That's what I thought.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.120
Like density.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.120
Well, it's not.

44:51.120 --> 44:52.120
What's your name?

44:52.120 --> 44:53.120
Will.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.120
Get the fuck up here, Will.

44:54.120 --> 44:55.120
Yeah.

44:55.120 --> 44:56.120
I will sacrifice.

44:56.120 --> 44:57.120
Scoota.

44:57.120 --> 44:58.120
Scoota, you're gone.

44:58.120 --> 44:59.120
Scoota.

44:59.120 --> 45:00.120
Scoota.

45:00.120 --> 45:03.120
This is like the worst game show ever, isn't it?

45:03.120 --> 45:09.040
And the prize is going to be the worst prize.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.040
What's your name, sir?

45:10.040 --> 45:11.040
My name's Will.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.040
Will.

45:12.040 --> 45:13.040
Okay.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.040
And so they actually measure several things.

45:14.040 --> 45:17.040
But one thing is sperm count, which is the number of sperm per volume.

45:17.040 --> 45:18.040
Okay.

45:18.040 --> 45:19.040
They also measure motility that he talked about.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.440
That's called the SPV, right?

45:20.440 --> 45:21.440
Sure.

45:21.440 --> 45:22.440
Okay.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.440
Sperm count.

45:23.440 --> 45:24.440
Sperm count.

45:24.440 --> 45:26.600
But then they do have motility, which is how many of them are moving well.

45:26.600 --> 45:27.600
Okay.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.600
Like a percentage of how many are moving well.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.600
All right.

45:29.600 --> 45:30.600
So sperm count.

45:30.600 --> 45:31.600
There's morphology also.

45:31.600 --> 45:32.600
What is that?

45:32.600 --> 45:34.120
How many look defective?

45:34.120 --> 45:35.120
How many actually look odd?

45:35.120 --> 45:36.120
Like two-headed sperm.

45:36.120 --> 45:37.120
Like two-headed sperm and crooked sperm.

45:37.120 --> 45:38.720
Do you want it to make it two-the-egg?

45:38.720 --> 45:39.720
Yeah.

45:39.720 --> 45:44.800
I don't care about anything but sperm count, because you always hear these statistics about

45:44.800 --> 45:47.400
oh, the average sperm count's gone down, or this lowers your sperm.

45:47.400 --> 45:51.320
I just want to know, how do they count sperm?

45:51.320 --> 45:56.320
Because if it's per volume, so that's per asset volume.

45:56.320 --> 46:06.240
So the thing is, it's not like forgive me, ladies, cover your ears.

46:06.240 --> 46:10.760
It's not like my balls have a bunch of cum in them, including the sperm, and then it's

46:10.760 --> 46:11.760
like a bag of liquid.

46:11.760 --> 46:13.320
Also, man, close your ears too.

46:13.320 --> 46:14.320
Yeah.

46:14.320 --> 46:15.320
Everybody.

46:15.320 --> 46:21.680
And then it all comes out like it's like, my balls are making sperm cells.

46:21.680 --> 46:24.880
The liquid that makes up a majority of the semen.

46:24.880 --> 46:28.200
Semen comes from some other place in my body.

46:28.200 --> 46:29.200
Prostate.

46:29.200 --> 46:30.200
Prostate.

46:30.200 --> 46:31.200
Prostate.

46:31.200 --> 46:32.200
And the seminal vesicle.

46:32.200 --> 46:33.200
There we go.

46:33.200 --> 46:34.200
Yeah.

46:34.200 --> 46:35.200
And don't forget the cowper's gland.

46:35.200 --> 46:36.200
What about...

46:36.200 --> 46:37.200
Isn't...

46:37.200 --> 46:38.200
Isn't Vaz deference?

46:38.200 --> 46:39.200
It's better to get up here.

46:39.200 --> 46:40.200
The Vaz deference.

46:40.200 --> 46:41.200
Vaz deference.

46:41.200 --> 46:49.560
So what volume are they taking when you cum?

46:49.560 --> 46:52.960
Is there a joke that's like, there's a Vaz deference between sperm and semen?

46:52.960 --> 46:53.960
You just made it.

46:53.960 --> 46:54.960
You just made it.

46:54.960 --> 46:55.960
Is that...

46:55.960 --> 46:56.960
You just made it.

46:56.960 --> 46:57.960
That's not...

46:57.960 --> 46:58.960
There's no way that's the first time.

46:58.960 --> 46:59.960
No.

46:59.960 --> 47:00.960
I wish you guys would take this seriously.

47:00.960 --> 47:04.360
They take a measured amount and they just count them.

47:04.360 --> 47:09.520
But they take what out of the wad that comes out, sorry ladies, the fucking cloudy wad.

47:09.520 --> 47:13.480
The fucking like, it's like, it looks like the earth in there.

47:13.480 --> 47:16.360
It looks like there's like North America and Australia.

47:16.360 --> 47:17.360
There's like...

47:17.360 --> 47:18.360
It's on your bathroom floor.

47:18.360 --> 47:19.360
I mean, how do you...

47:19.360 --> 47:20.360
There's like...

47:20.360 --> 47:21.360
You know what cum looks like.

47:21.360 --> 47:24.480
Like there's like, it doesn't look like glue.

47:24.480 --> 47:25.960
It looks like fucking...

47:25.960 --> 47:26.960
We know...

47:26.960 --> 47:31.080
Dino, our friend who we all know very well from his shady encounters, he was...

47:31.080 --> 47:33.200
Did he talk about him being a sperm donor for a while?

47:33.200 --> 47:34.200
Yeah, Dino was.

47:34.200 --> 47:35.200
Yeah.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.200
And he was...

47:36.200 --> 47:37.200
Did we discuss that in the show?

47:37.200 --> 47:41.640
So he would go in there and like donate sperm all the time so Dino may have countless

47:41.640 --> 47:42.640
children out there.

47:42.640 --> 47:43.640
We have no idea.

47:43.640 --> 47:44.640
That's terrifying.

47:44.640 --> 47:52.440
The woman that ran the sperm counter, counter, the counter where you put your sperm on to

47:52.440 --> 47:53.440
have it counted.

47:53.440 --> 47:54.440
Yes.

47:54.440 --> 47:56.640
She would look at it and go, get the fucking back in there.

47:56.640 --> 47:57.640
Like this is just water.

47:57.640 --> 48:01.080
Like you've been jerking off too much.

48:01.080 --> 48:04.440
Come back when you haven't jerked off all fucking day long and bring me some actual

48:04.440 --> 48:05.440
like, cum.

48:05.440 --> 48:09.880
She could tell me by looking at it, we can't do anything with this is all.

48:09.880 --> 48:10.880
All right.

48:10.880 --> 48:12.400
So that kind of goes to my point, I guess.

48:12.400 --> 48:17.080
The idea, I mean, this is not a, this is an organic, like I still don't, I don't understand

48:17.080 --> 48:18.440
this idea that you can scientifically...

48:18.440 --> 48:19.680
It's a solution.

48:19.680 --> 48:21.680
It's not like one constant thing.

48:21.680 --> 48:25.680
So in the solution, there's some stuff that's sperm, that's swimming sperm, and some stuff

48:25.680 --> 48:26.680
that supports it.

48:26.680 --> 48:27.680
But sometimes...

48:27.680 --> 48:28.680
Okay.

48:28.680 --> 48:29.680
They measure a set amount of volume.

48:29.680 --> 48:30.680
Okay.

48:30.680 --> 48:31.680
So here's, okay.

48:31.680 --> 48:33.600
So here's my follow up question.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.600
Please sir.

48:34.600 --> 48:35.600
Simmer down.

48:35.600 --> 48:37.800
We'll get to you in a moment.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.840
That's beef steak bill, I believe.

48:39.840 --> 48:40.840
What do you do, Will?

48:40.840 --> 48:41.840
What's your job?

48:41.840 --> 48:44.360
I work for a health insurance company.

48:44.360 --> 48:45.360
Okay.

48:45.360 --> 48:51.040
So I think I'm starting to get this, what I'm deducing from this is that when you, forgive

48:51.040 --> 48:54.200
me ladies, just, I'll be with you in one moment.

48:54.200 --> 49:01.560
When you come, like you're coming like a random amount of fluid, like sometimes, you know,

49:01.560 --> 49:05.600
it's like, you know, it's like a little bit, and sometimes it's a lot.

49:05.600 --> 49:08.880
Sometimes it's just dust.

49:08.880 --> 49:11.440
I can't use this, come back.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.440
And so I'm assuming...

49:12.440 --> 49:13.440
Cook the mail.

49:13.440 --> 49:15.880
We're going to table that comment until a little later.

49:15.880 --> 49:21.080
And so I'm assuming, like, that what that means is that the amount of fluid that comes

49:21.080 --> 49:25.920
out of your wiener when you have an orgasm has nothing to do.

49:25.920 --> 49:30.560
That's like just a, that's just fluid, that your sperm count, even on a bad day, or a

49:30.560 --> 49:35.400
bad, bad day, meaning like less fluid coming out of your wiener, like during an orgasm,

49:35.400 --> 49:40.960
that that would have the same sperm count as Wednesday when you're like, whoa, it took

49:40.960 --> 49:45.640
me a long time, and whew, like, and it's like, wow, look at all that, but it's like

49:45.640 --> 49:49.880
same sperm, still, still three, three per drop, though.

49:49.880 --> 49:52.960
Can I ask you a, probably, what might be a personal back straight question?

49:52.960 --> 49:54.880
Are you going in regularly to a...

49:54.880 --> 49:58.480
No, I'm asking this because I'm just curious about how they count sperm.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.400
No, this is not, there's nothing personal about it.

50:00.400 --> 50:01.400
Have you, have you gone in?

50:01.400 --> 50:02.400
And it shouldn't have taken this long.

50:02.400 --> 50:03.520
I just want to know how they count sperm.

50:03.520 --> 50:05.640
Have you already gone in and tried this, or this is, this is...

50:05.640 --> 50:06.640
No.

50:06.640 --> 50:07.640
Oh, oh, oh.

50:07.640 --> 50:08.640
I just said no.

50:08.640 --> 50:09.640
Okay, so I'm sorry.

50:09.640 --> 50:14.240
I'm just wondering, have you gone in to the, I don't know why I'm just so frustrated with

50:14.240 --> 50:15.240
you guys tonight.

50:15.240 --> 50:17.640
Like, I don't, I don't, like, it's gotta be me.

50:17.640 --> 50:20.640
I honestly really thought that you, like, this is something that you have gone in and

50:20.640 --> 50:24.680
tried multiple times, the way that you started talking about it sounded like, like...

50:24.680 --> 50:25.680
No, because then I just know about it.

50:25.680 --> 50:26.680
I don't, I don't...

50:26.680 --> 50:31.200
He's just curious, and I think your question is, when it, when it's a lot, or when it's

50:31.200 --> 50:36.200
a little, is it still the same number of sperm and it's just more liquid, or is it the same

50:36.200 --> 50:37.800
density, hence more sperm?

50:37.800 --> 50:38.800
Yes.

50:38.800 --> 50:39.800
Yes.

50:39.800 --> 50:40.800
Yes.

50:40.800 --> 50:41.800
So how do they, like...

50:41.800 --> 50:42.800
I couldn't tell you that.

50:42.800 --> 50:43.800
Right.

50:43.800 --> 50:44.800
I mean, it should be...

50:44.800 --> 50:45.800
I've only read it.

50:45.800 --> 50:49.560
Just mathematically, yeah, it should just average out to the point that they could do science

50:49.560 --> 50:51.640
and determine what's good or bad.

50:51.640 --> 50:56.760
So each man is walking around with a certain amount of sperm that he sets to the task whenever

50:56.760 --> 51:02.000
he ejaculates, and, but, but it always happens with a random amount of fluid.

51:02.000 --> 51:08.160
And that, that sample of sperm might be lazy, weirdo sperm, so they might be, they might

51:08.160 --> 51:09.160
be good ones.

51:09.160 --> 51:10.520
And when they're counting them, they're not worried about that.

51:10.520 --> 51:15.440
They'll go like, well, you got a very high sperm count, but they all look like Greg Allman.

51:15.440 --> 51:16.440
Yeah.

51:16.440 --> 51:19.160
Four tails, you know, it works.

51:19.160 --> 51:20.160
All right.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.640
Well, let's thank our sperm panel.

51:21.640 --> 51:22.640
Sprimpanel!

51:22.640 --> 51:23.640
Sprimpanel!

51:23.640 --> 51:24.640
Yep.

51:24.640 --> 51:25.640
Come again.

51:25.640 --> 51:26.640
Yep.

51:26.640 --> 51:32.120
Hey, you forgot your drink.

51:32.120 --> 51:33.120
You forgot it.

51:33.120 --> 51:34.120
Who forgot it?

51:34.120 --> 51:35.120
Okay.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.120
Not you guys, you're good.

51:36.120 --> 51:37.120
Michael's sperm and Will's sperm.

51:37.120 --> 51:40.880
Scoot his sperm.

51:40.880 --> 51:42.120
That scoot is a looker, huh?

51:42.120 --> 51:43.120
Yeah, man.

51:43.120 --> 51:44.400
He's a handsome young man.

51:44.400 --> 51:51.680
I thought, I thought, you could be in a nightmare in Elm Street movie.

51:51.680 --> 51:55.560
Is that what, are we connecting dots right now?

51:55.560 --> 51:56.560
Yeah, yeah.

51:56.560 --> 51:57.560
A nightmare in Elm Street too.

51:57.560 --> 51:58.560
I'm gonna count my sperm.

51:58.560 --> 52:03.560
I don't know what we're, I don't know what we're, and I want Scooter to do all the counting.

52:03.560 --> 52:10.000
If I wanted to have a baby with a woman and raise it with a man, how would my sperm count

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
matter?

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
Yeah.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
Damn, why is that on your mind?

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Is that because it's just...

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
It's just random.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Why is anything?

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
It's just...

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
It's just because you're thinking of child rearing?

52:20.000 --> 52:23.920
I think it's because he was thinking that sometimes he comes a lot and sometimes he

52:23.920 --> 52:26.840
comes a little and he's like, well, how does that work when they're counting it?

52:26.840 --> 52:30.920
I guess that's probably when it popped in my head today when I jerked off, yeah.

52:30.920 --> 52:31.920
It's also weird.

52:31.920 --> 52:34.560
Oh, and I was like, oh, that's a little, it felt good though.

52:34.560 --> 52:35.560
It...

52:35.560 --> 52:36.560
But it's also...

52:36.560 --> 52:39.240
And then I was like, and then I was like laying there and going to sleep on a nice summer

52:39.240 --> 52:41.440
afternoon and I was like, ah, it feels good.

52:41.440 --> 52:45.400
I wonder if it feels better when there's more liquid that comes out or when there's more

52:45.400 --> 52:46.640
sperm coming out.

52:46.640 --> 52:47.640
It is interesting.

52:47.640 --> 52:48.640
And you said this...

52:48.640 --> 52:52.480
And then I thought, well, there's probably, there's probably not a variation in the sperm

52:52.480 --> 52:57.080
because there's sperm count and they like, and then that's why I thought, so.

52:57.080 --> 53:01.440
You said this, it isn't that this is gonna be so gross, but if you take longer, there's

53:01.440 --> 53:03.880
more that comes out.

53:03.880 --> 53:07.960
Is it like your body like sort of like, he worked hard for this?

53:07.960 --> 53:09.960
Give him more.

53:09.960 --> 53:10.960
Yeah.

53:10.960 --> 53:11.960
I mean, that's weird.

53:11.960 --> 53:12.960
It's so weird.

53:12.960 --> 53:13.960
I don't know what kind...

53:13.960 --> 53:14.960
Our bodies are weird.

53:14.960 --> 53:15.960
Well, we had that anthropologist guy, doctor.

53:15.960 --> 53:16.960
What's his name?

53:16.960 --> 53:21.280
The guy was, I never remember anyone's name, but that guy was like the punk rock anthropologist

53:21.280 --> 53:25.480
who's one of his big theories that people know him for is that the human penis has a

53:25.480 --> 53:28.720
head on it because it's a plunger.

53:28.720 --> 53:30.280
It's supposed to like, you know...

53:30.280 --> 53:35.720
I'll scrape out, just suck out, like, like, like pull back, like the previous competitors.

53:35.720 --> 53:37.480
Oh, dear God.

53:37.480 --> 53:40.680
I don't think that does not happen.

53:40.680 --> 53:44.040
I don't think when I have sex, there's more sperm in my penis.

53:44.040 --> 53:48.560
Well, he's saying, get that other guy that just fucked you up before me, get it, remove

53:48.560 --> 53:49.560
his stuff.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.920
But into your penis.

53:50.920 --> 53:52.920
Not into your penis now.

53:52.920 --> 53:55.920
Hey, how do you...

53:55.920 --> 53:57.800
I thought it's like...

53:57.800 --> 53:58.800
That's called the syringe.

53:58.800 --> 53:59.800
Get it, get it, get it.

53:59.800 --> 54:00.800
That's called the syringe.

54:00.800 --> 54:01.800
That's called the syringe.

54:01.800 --> 54:02.800
And then mine.

54:02.800 --> 54:03.800
No, no, no.

54:03.800 --> 54:04.800
That would be amazing.

54:04.800 --> 54:12.600
That would be so amazing if that's like the pinnacle of human competitiveness is like,

54:12.600 --> 54:16.160
it's like, now your cum's in my dick.

54:16.160 --> 54:20.200
That's how straight I am.

54:20.200 --> 54:25.200
In my dreams, you're still the same.

54:25.200 --> 54:29.960
So his thing is that the head script takes out all the other...

54:29.960 --> 54:36.400
It's like a plunger, like you're creating suction on the way out, I think it's pulling

54:36.400 --> 54:37.400
back.

54:37.400 --> 54:38.400
I don't...

54:38.400 --> 54:43.800
Animals probably had that, and then it evolved less and less, but it's probably a remnant

54:43.800 --> 54:44.800
of that.

54:44.800 --> 54:45.800
I can imagine.

54:45.800 --> 54:46.800
It could be, who knows.

54:46.800 --> 54:50.440
I think what's interesting is actually, I think the important thing about anthropology

54:50.440 --> 54:55.400
is not proving things, but actually coming up with crazy theories because we are basing

54:55.400 --> 54:59.480
all of our understanding on humanity and crazy theories that regularly get disproved.

54:59.480 --> 55:03.560
In 1995, we found out a bunch of shit that they're still teaching in high schools that's

55:03.560 --> 55:06.600
based on 50s understanding of anthropology.

55:06.600 --> 55:10.360
It all fell apart in 95, but they still teach the same thing, which is basically that we

55:10.360 --> 55:15.560
were apes and trees and that there was some kind of climatic change that put us onto the

55:15.560 --> 55:20.640
plains in the savannah environment, and then that's why we started walking up right and

55:20.640 --> 55:21.640
all this stuff.

55:21.640 --> 55:24.240
No, no, that's been proven false.

55:24.240 --> 55:29.480
It's been proven very, very unlikely if not actually proven false by analyzing the food

55:29.480 --> 55:32.560
that we ate at certain times in our evolutionary.

55:32.560 --> 55:33.560
Anyways...

55:33.560 --> 55:40.240
So we're never going to know anything because we're trying to dig up our own bones and figure

55:40.240 --> 55:48.240
out at what point did we stop being monkeys and start being these amazing specimens.

55:48.240 --> 55:56.240
I like that half ass flourish.

55:56.240 --> 56:00.200
Alright, so it was an actual...

56:00.200 --> 56:04.600
I was playing the Mad Max video game all day today.

56:04.600 --> 56:05.600
And you liked this game.

56:05.600 --> 56:06.600
Well, I was shit talking to you.

56:06.600 --> 56:09.360
I thought you had a very funny tweet about it, about the dog.

56:09.360 --> 56:10.360
Yeah.

56:10.360 --> 56:11.360
Well, thank you.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.640
I mean, it was an actual...

56:13.640 --> 56:15.640
My dogs are going insane from the fucking...

56:15.640 --> 56:16.640
I thought it was very funny.

56:16.640 --> 56:19.760
I had to go clear the minefields because there's a dog in the game that barks when you're near

56:19.760 --> 56:20.760
a mine.

56:20.760 --> 56:21.760
And the dog...

56:21.760 --> 56:22.760
But here's the interesting...

56:22.760 --> 56:23.760
Is it a game based on the new film?

56:23.760 --> 56:24.760
No.

56:24.760 --> 56:29.640
No, they were making it before that movie got greenlit.

56:29.640 --> 56:34.160
But then they kind of put a bunch of Fury Road kind of stuff in it, too.

56:34.160 --> 56:37.120
Like the title, I think.

56:37.120 --> 56:40.720
But yeah, the dogs...

56:40.720 --> 56:41.720
So the dogs...

56:41.720 --> 56:46.440
Obviously, what's happening is they recorded a dog, a real dog, and they don't know what

56:46.440 --> 56:47.440
the...

56:47.440 --> 56:51.080
They're just having the dog bark and then having the dog growl and then having the dog do different

56:51.080 --> 56:54.560
kinds of barks because you're using the different kinds of barks to find the mines that you

56:54.560 --> 56:55.560
have to defuse.

56:55.560 --> 56:58.960
So obviously, the dog is saying something like, like, my name's Roger.

56:58.960 --> 57:00.120
Hey, hey, I'm over here.

57:00.120 --> 57:01.120
My name's Roger.

57:01.120 --> 57:02.120
Like, or something.

57:02.120 --> 57:03.120
Who knows what it's saying?

57:03.120 --> 57:04.120
Like, it could be...

57:04.120 --> 57:05.120
I don't know how they got the dog to bark.

57:05.120 --> 57:06.120
They might have shown it a picture of a cat.

57:06.120 --> 57:07.120
So it's going like, everybody, look at this cat.

57:07.120 --> 57:08.120
This cat.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.120
There's a cat in front of me.

57:09.120 --> 57:10.120
My name's Steve.

57:10.120 --> 57:11.120
My name's Steve.

57:11.120 --> 57:12.120
I'm a dog.

57:12.120 --> 57:13.120
I'm looking at a cat.

57:13.120 --> 57:14.320
But at any rate, like, the dogs are just like...

57:14.320 --> 57:17.360
Because if there was a video game, but you didn't know what video game's where, and you

57:17.360 --> 57:22.120
just all of a sudden, you heard some guy in your house going, like, hey, hey, happy birthday.

57:22.120 --> 57:23.120
Happy birthday.

57:23.120 --> 57:24.120
I had a birthday once.

57:24.120 --> 57:25.120
My name's Mike.

57:25.120 --> 57:26.120
My name's Mike.

57:26.120 --> 57:27.120
It's my birthday, too.

57:27.120 --> 57:32.120
You'd also do the human equivalent of what the dogs are doing, which is like not bark,

57:32.120 --> 57:34.120
but you'd like grab a butcher knife or like go...

57:34.120 --> 57:36.120
Like, they're going to go right.

57:36.120 --> 57:37.120
So the dogs are like...

57:37.120 --> 57:40.120
They're freaking out, and Harvey already, like, he freaks out when he sees dogs.

57:40.120 --> 57:44.120
Then he sees the dog in the Mad Max car, like, barking at the bombs, and he's just freaking

57:44.120 --> 57:45.120
out.

57:45.120 --> 57:46.120
And...

57:46.120 --> 57:48.960
But then over time, they got used to it.

57:48.960 --> 57:49.960
So I think that's very...

57:49.960 --> 57:55.120
The dogs, they understand, like, they started to figure out it was a recording.

57:55.120 --> 57:57.800
Because that's why they don't react every time music comes on.

57:57.800 --> 57:58.800
They're not like, where's Beck?

57:58.800 --> 58:00.120
Why is Beck in the house?

58:00.120 --> 58:06.120
Do you ever notice that animals, they don't freak out as much as they should about, like,

58:06.120 --> 58:07.120
TV and music?

58:07.120 --> 58:08.120
Like, what it's just playing?

58:08.120 --> 58:12.220
Like, given how fucking freaked out they get when they hear, like, a raccoon, a block

58:12.220 --> 58:15.120
away, like, scratch its ass, like, they're like...

58:15.120 --> 58:21.120
Or when there's a ghost in your closet.

58:21.120 --> 58:22.120
You know it.

58:22.120 --> 58:23.120
You've seen it.

58:23.120 --> 58:26.120
Don't act all scientific.

58:26.120 --> 58:33.120
Do you think your dog, when it sees a dog on TV, is like, oh, that's a dog?

58:33.120 --> 58:35.120
I don't know, because they change sides.

58:35.120 --> 58:36.120
Like, why does the dog...

58:36.120 --> 58:37.120
Yeah.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.120
I don't...

58:38.120 --> 58:39.120
But Nigel doesn't do it.

58:39.120 --> 58:44.920
Nigel reacts to the barking sounds, like, in stuff, but he doesn't watch TV.

58:44.920 --> 58:45.920
Harvey watches TV.

58:45.920 --> 58:50.800
And if he sees a dog or a Danny DeVito, he, like, freaks out.

58:50.800 --> 58:51.800
And that's not a joke.

58:51.800 --> 58:53.120
Like, a Danny DeVito, like...

58:53.120 --> 58:55.120
Because he cuts the silhouettes.

58:55.120 --> 58:59.120
Like, late, always sunny.

58:59.120 --> 59:02.120
But then, well, that's what I thought, because I was like, oh, he gets scruffier.

59:02.120 --> 59:03.120
You should try, like, different versions.

59:03.120 --> 59:06.120
But then he was barking at the iTunes menu, and it was the Rainmaker movie, the key art.

59:06.120 --> 59:11.120
He's walking next to Matt Damon with a briefcase, and he's like, I'm like, it's fucking DeVito.

59:11.120 --> 59:17.120
You should try Batman Returns to see if in the Penguin makeup, if he still barks.

59:17.120 --> 59:18.120
Yeah.

59:18.120 --> 59:20.120
But honestly, the novelties weren't off of me.

59:20.120 --> 59:23.120
And now it's just terror, because it means your dog can read.

59:23.120 --> 59:25.120
I don't understand, like, he does it, because it cuts.

59:25.120 --> 59:27.120
Like, does he think that he's looking through a magic window?

59:27.120 --> 59:28.120
Yeah, I don't know.

59:28.120 --> 59:29.120
That's always changing.

59:29.120 --> 59:32.120
I think he's probably just reacting to very simple stimulus, like, the sound of something.

59:32.120 --> 59:34.120
And you realize, okay, that's only sound.

59:34.120 --> 59:35.120
There's no smell to that.

59:35.120 --> 59:36.120
Like, it's not connected for me.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.120
Right.

59:37.120 --> 59:38.120
I bet smell is a big way.

59:38.120 --> 59:42.120
So I'm hearing a noise, but I'm not connecting it to a thing.

59:42.120 --> 59:44.120
Or I'm smelling something, but where's the visual?

59:44.120 --> 59:48.120
Like, I would guess that it's very simple little stimuli.

59:48.120 --> 59:49.120
Maybe?

59:49.120 --> 59:51.120
I don't know, man, because I think it is.

59:51.120 --> 59:52.120
Well, it's...

59:52.120 --> 59:53.120
I understand that...

59:53.120 --> 59:57.120
I mean, you could say that about anything, honestly, with any animal, including us.

59:57.120 --> 01:00:02.120
But the thing is, like, he sees the dog on the screen, and then forget about barking.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.120
Like, just like we're watching, like, a cartoon where, like, a dog loves cereal.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:09.120
And there's, like, a cartoon dog walking on its hind legs.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.120
Schrab's dog, by the way, does this with the family guy.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.120
That fucking dog, like, his dog recognizes as a dog and starts freaking out.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.120
It's like, it looks like a coffee mug.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.120
It doesn't even look like a dog.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:23.120
It's like an artistic expression of the idea of a dog.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.120
And the dog's like, yeah, that's a dog.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:30.120
What we've done to dogs, like, Canis Familiaris, like, domesticated dogs, is we've made them...

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.120
What did you call them?

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.120
Canis Familiaris, I believe, is the species, right?

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.120
Am I getting that right?

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.120
That's all dogs that are...

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:39.120
Well, that's what we call, like, our domesticated dogs.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.120
Like, not wolves.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.120
Ironically, when you're on unfamiliar terms with them.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.120
That's pretty cool.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.120
It's as familiar as you're going to get with a Canis.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.120
It's the best case scenario.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.120
But, like, we breed certain dogs for herding.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.120
So, like, if you have, like, a German shepherd, or like an Australian shepherd,

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.120
and you walk them down the road, they bark at cars moving,

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.120
because they want to herd, like, moving things next to you.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.120
They want to move things.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.120
Other dogs are about burrowing.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.120
Other dogs are about sheltering.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.120
Other dogs are about just straight at protection.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.120
So, we've bred them to do very specific tasks.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.120
And now, Harvey is one.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.120
So, what do you think those golden retriever and a poodle are?

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120
What are those wiener dogs for?

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.120
Do you think they're for, like, cleaning the insides of cannons?

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.120
They're fluffy little dogs.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.120
I asked a guy that on the sidewalk.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.120
We have to get inside this cannon, but I won't go in there.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.120
I told this story on the show, I'm sure, like,

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.120
because I asked that of a guy on the sidewalk.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.120
I was looking at his little dog, and I was like,

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.120
I was like, oh, I never noticed, like,

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.120
you see cartoons of these things, or you see them in movies,

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.120
but I just realized it's a regular-sized dog,

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.120
but it's just, like, it's a dwarf.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:53.120
It has, like, little, tiny, stunted legs.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.120
And I was just, like, marveling at it.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.120
I was like, huh, we really did a number on these things.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:03.120
And what do you, you know, every dog has, like,

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.120
a thing, what do you think these things are for?

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.120
Like, going back to, what was their purpose?

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.120
And I, like, sometimes would be rambling,

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.120
because it was a friend of, like, Ridley's or something

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.120
that he was just talking to, and I was just, like,

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.120
like, kind of, like, shitting on his dog.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.120
I don't know, I guess I was like, yeah,

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:22.120
I was like, and then halfway through my questions

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.120
about the dog breed, he was like,

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.120
I don't know, I didn't invent him, I just own him.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.120
Wow.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.120
Like, he was kind of defensive, like, I guess it felt like

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.120
I was accusing him of, like, eugenics or something.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.120
I feel like a good question.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.120
A lot of the really extreme, like, breeds that, like,

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.120
they are, like, like, porgy's and, like,

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.120
I think, like, the wiener dogs, whatever they call those,

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.120
and, like, giant dogs, those have been,

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.120
we have made those extreme by breeding those just for looks.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.120
Right.

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120
That's just fascinating.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.120
Yeah, and, like, the 1800s, it's just, like, rich British people going,

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120
like, I want to think that...

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.120
If you took a British bulldog back when it was actually

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.120
more like the actual dog, it kind of was bred to be,

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.120
like, naturally, it was a much more effective,

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.120
like, healthy dog, and now we've taken that dog

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.120
and made it way less healthy, and Sharpays are just,

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.120
you know, riddled with disease, and German Shepherds,

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.120
there's no reason where the spines are curved like that.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.120
What's the dog that has, like, the alcohol

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.120
to save people in the snow?

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.120
St. Bernard's.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120
In cartoons?

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120
St. Bernard's.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120
Snoop Dogg.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.120
And that's what that's for.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.120
Yeah.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.120
And you know, you know, they sew those...

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.120
They sew those barrels to their necks.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120
Oh, no.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.120
They're born with them now.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.120
It's really inhumane.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.120
Yeah.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.120
I think wiener dogs chase rats.

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.120
I think that's why they're bred.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.120
Terriers, like rat terriers, their legs are small

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.120
so they can get through little holes,

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.120
and they kept rats off your farm and out of your grain

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.120
so that you could sell your shit without them.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.120
And they have a heavy, heavy, like, relative to dogs,

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.120
a huge, like, their diagnosable OCD, the terriers.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.120
Oh, really?

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.120
Like Jack Russell's in particular,

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.120
like, because they're such good rodent dogs,

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.120
they've bred, now they've bred, it's like,

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.120
they're obsessed with detail.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.120
They're obsessed with holes, electrical outlets,

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.120
corners of the coffee table.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.120
If they start licking your face, they can't stop.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.120
You know, like...

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.120
And they hear my new scratches.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.120
The coolest thing, like, my friend has a Jack Russell terrier

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.120
and it's like, do we live in a house full of ghosts

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.120
because this dog is hearing something at all times

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.120
and trying to burrow through the wall?

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.120
Like, he's just a burrower.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.120
So by that logic, your dog was maybe bred

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.120
to fight Danny DeVito.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.120
And there's some guy who hates Danny DeVito

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.120
who's like, I fucking bred this dog.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.120
I don't know where it went.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.120
Or maybe just bring him to me.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.120
Yeah.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.120
He's in Hollywood, maybe he'll run into Danny DeVito

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.120
at some point.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.120
Yeah, he gets out of the yard for three days,

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.120
he comes back and let Danny DeVito

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.120
just in his mouth.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.120
40 years ago...

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.120
I'm so sorry, sir.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.120
Let me call you an Uber.

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.120
It's a golden noodle.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120
I understand.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.120
I get it all the time.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.120
It happens like three times a week.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.120
And I hope you won't take this personally,

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:07.120
but I'm leading the charge on legislation

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.120
against these animals.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.120
Danny DeVito seems awesome, just a side note.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.120
Every story you hear about him would confirm that, yeah.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.120
He sounds fun by all counts.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.120
All right, Danny DeVito slipped through the cracks.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.120
The highway men, not so lucky.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.120
Nightmare on Elm Street too.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.120
You're a little competitive tonight, Dan.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.120
I feel like you're coming in loaded for bear.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.120
You want to win these arguments as opposed to...

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.120
Maybe it's because I was playing Mad Max all day.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:42.120
I was playing Mad Max, I wasn't what I was going to say.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.120
I am getting into the game now,

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:47.120
and you're doing a lot of car combat.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.120
I was kind of going like,

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.120
What a lovely day, what a lovely day!

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.120
And then like six o'clock,

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.120
I bothered to go outside to play fetch with the dogs,

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.120
and it was like, Oh shit, what a lovely day.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:06.120
It's 9-Eleven, what a lovely day!

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.120
What a lovely day!

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.120
What wasn't a lovely day?

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.120
It's the opposite of a lovely day.

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.120
9-Eleven.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.120
I mean, meteorologically it was a lovely day.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:24.120
Okay, let's move off.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.120
We can't be like, Listen.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.120
Silver lining, it was gorgeous.

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:31.120
It was like 79 degrees.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:35.120
I mean, it could not have happened on a more beautiful day.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.120
I can't say any of that.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.120
What else do you have on your list?

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.120
I thought maybe we should check in with you

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.120
because we don't see you anymore.

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.120
What's been going on?

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.120
Your show is doing well, everyone loves it.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:55.120
You're shooting in movies now in all kinds of places.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.120
The thing I was most excited about was,

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.120
I did an episode of X-Files.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:08.120
That was the one that I was really, truly, very, very nervous about.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.120
And very, very excited.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.120
Can we know what your role was

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.120
or is that disclosure that you're not allowed to?

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.120
No, I don't think I could say, but it's not a huge role,

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.120
but it's not tiny either.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.120
I saw a photo, you were dressed in some sort of official outfit.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.120
Yeah.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.120
You were allowed to post that or you're not allowed to post that?

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.120
Yeah, I'm an animal control officer

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.120
because that's what it says on my badge, so I guess,

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.120
I think they will maybe annoyed that I,

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.120
but you know, it's the X-Files.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.120
There's animal control officers.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.120
But it was crazy because I, honestly,

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.120
I found out two months before I did it and I was like,

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.120
I didn't tell anybody, I didn't watch a single episode

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.120
because I was freaked out.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:50.120
And then when I landed, I was like, fine.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.120
I was like, I worked on the scenes.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.120
I was like, I'm not going to be nervous.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.120
And then when they picked me up, they gave me a folder

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.120
and it said, Kumail, Nanjiani, X-Files,

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.120
welcome folder.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.120
And it was Mulder's like, I want to believe poster,

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.120
but instead of, I want to believe it was my name.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.120
And that's what I called Emily.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.120
I was like, Emily, I'm freaking out a little bit right now.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.120
You need to talk me down.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.120
What did you mean you said you didn't watch a single episode?

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.120
I didn't watch for two months before

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.120
because I'd known for two months I was going to do it

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.120
because I didn't want to start freaking out.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.120
You didn't want to know, you didn't want to have too much information

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.120
about the show you were going to be on in your head.

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.120
Or be too much of a nervous fanboy.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.120
Yeah, I just wanted it to be a job and not like,

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.120
fucking the dream, I never dare dream coming true, you know?

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.120
That makes sense.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120
See, that's why I'm not an actor.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.120
Compare yourself to all the other actors that were ever on it

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.120
and all that stuff.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.120
I wouldn't even have had that common sense.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.120
I would have been like, oh, I should watch every episode twice

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.120
so that I really know the tone of the show.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.120
And then I'd be like, to be or not to be.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.120
And they'd be like, what are you doing?

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.120
I'm like, well, I want to watch all the show.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.120
I know the show super well, so that wasn't the...

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.120
But I had to sort of like pretend to be cool around them

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.120
like, oh, hello, David, Jillian.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.120
Nice to meet you.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.120
Did you get to work closely with those two?

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120
Yeah.

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:07.120
That's great.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.120
He loves to cool there a little bit.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.120
Yeah.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.120
Yeah.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.120
Because I didn't just talk to...

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.120
Scooter, take a sperm count on that just now.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.120
It's skyrocketed.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.120
It's 15080.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.120
Wow.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.120
That's a very rare case.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.120
I had this moment where I didn't just meet...

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.120
I had a scene with them.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.120
I had a couple of scenes with them.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.120
Well, I had scenes with them.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:36.120
It's pretty hard for me to talk about without getting teary eyed.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.120
Don't be shy.

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.120
So I had this moment where I was like, I didn't...

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.120
Because I was talking to, you know,

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.120
Jillian Anderson, David Duchovny, and I kind of like, you know,

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.120
I was with them for three days.

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.120
And then during one of the scenes, I was like,

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.120
oh, I'm talking to Mulder and Scully now.

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.120
Like, I didn't just talk to David Duchovny and Jillian Anderson.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.120
I talked to Mulder and Scully.

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.120
With the haircuts and the...

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.120
With the haircuts and the everything.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.120
And the cell phones and the...

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120
Flashlights.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.120
And the simmering sexual tension.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.120
Yeah, it was great.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.120
I hope I'm good in it.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.120
I have no idea.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.120
Usually when I do a job, I'm like, oh, I did well.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.120
Or that wasn't as good.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.120
This one, I have no idea.

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.120
I could be like...

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.120
So I'm a failure as a fan,

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.120
because I don't even know the details.

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.120
Like, is Chris Carter running it?

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.120
Yeah.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.120
And are a lot of the old writers back?

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.120
Or is he...

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120
A lot of them are back.

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.120
Not Vince Gilligan.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.120
But my...

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.120
Why not?

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.120
He just was at home, you know,

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.120
hanging out.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.120
I...

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.120
The episode was written and directed

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.120
by my favorite ex-files writer, Darren Morgan.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.120
Darren Morgan.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.120
Yeah.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.120
Is that the guy that did the Jose...

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.120
Yeah, that's the guy that did that one

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.120
and Clyde Brockman's final reposition.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.120
Spencer, are you a big ex-files fan?

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.120
Nope.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.120
I just listened to the podcast.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.120
Probably everybody that listens to our podcast

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.120
knows Gommel is a podcast called The Ex-Files Files.

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.120
And he talks to, like, lots of...

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.120
Yeah.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.120
He's gone all the way...

01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.120
I mean, this has to be the best-case scenario.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.120
You start a podcast about something you love.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120
Do you...

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.120
I mean, were you hired because you're a successful actor

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.120
right now, or because you have that podcast,

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.120
or a mixture of both, or...

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.120
I mean, they clearly were, like,

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.120
it'll mean so much to this guy.

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.120
That's great!

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.120
And it does.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.120
Yeah, they were...

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.120
I want to start a podcast called Vivian Westwood Suits.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.120
Yeah.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.120
That's actually a smart move for, like,

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.120
not a huge part, but an important part.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.120
Because thinking as a producer, I'd be like,

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.120
well, this guy's not going to complain if we go over time.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.120
Oh, yeah.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.120
I was like, I'm here.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.120
What do you guys need?

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.120
I can serve the food, whatever you want.

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.120
We need you to get into makeup, and then just sit.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.120
We're going to shoot you whenever the other actors are busy.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.120
Okay, all right.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.120
Yeah.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.120
Okay.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.120
Thank you for having me.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.120
I want to go back to what you said earlier.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.120
Like you say, sometimes you walk away from having shot something,

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:52.120
and you go nailed it, or sucked, but you have...

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.120
I have zero sense...

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.120
Was your memory just completely overblown?

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.120
No, I remember every single moment.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:01.120
It was like, I don't know if I'm good in this, or...

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.120
It was hard.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:04.120
Because it's also outside of my...

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.120
Like, I haven't done sci-fi or horror stuff.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.120
I've done most of the content.

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.120
Was it heavy lifting?

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.120
Did you have a lot of emotional range stuff to go through,

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.120
or was it pretty...

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.120
It wasn't like a fully easy part.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.120
Like, it was kind of hard.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.120
Like, there was...

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.120
I had to, like, do stuff,

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.120
instead of just, like, crack-wise.

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.120
Yeah.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.120
So, it was a hard part.

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.120
Did you labor over the rehearsal, like, at home?

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.120
Oh, my God.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.120
I worked on it so much.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.120
I worked on it so much.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.120
And that's what it's hard to know, like...

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:37.120
Well, then when you get there and you worked on it really hard,

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.120
then it's just noises that you're making,

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.120
and you have...

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.120
It's candy.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.120
Oh, shit.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.120
Yeah, that's Alan Woo.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.120
Alan Woo, who probably became a director

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.120
because he loves attention.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.120
He loves...

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.120
Do you know Alan, or do you...

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.120
Oh, you know, you're just...

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.120
Why did you guys do...

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.120
He would like...

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.120
He nodded at Cumeo.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.120
Attack on the show.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.120
Oh, Attack on the show.

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.120
Yeah.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.120
Alan Woo.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.120
Alan Woo.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.120
Alan Woo.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.120
Alan Woo.

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.120
Hey, I'm gonna go to the bathroom, you guys.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.120
Oh.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.120
Okay.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.120
All right.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.120
That's nice to get a...

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:14.120
That's probably the first applause he's gotten for that since 1987.

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.120
Yeah.

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:23.120
Yeah, you know, I mean, yeah, when do you get applause for that?

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.120
Does anyone remember being potty trained?

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.120
Is that a memory?

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:31.120
No, but I remember my cousin, who was my age, ate his own shit,

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.120
and it was a huge family scandal.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.120
A scandal?

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.120
Yeah, it was like spoken in hushedowns.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:39.120
Like his mom came in and she saw him.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.120
At what age are we talking?

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.120
I don't know, but we...

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.120
Like infancy or a toddler?

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.120
Enough to be walking around and stuff.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.120
And he just picked up some poop and just...

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.120
Well, he...

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.120
He tried it on for says.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.120
She put him on the toilet, and then when she came back,

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.120
he had done his business and he was like...

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:58.120
He was bent over and just like pulling out and eating it like,

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.120
like, oh, I poop too much.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.120
I should put...

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.120
He did not say I poop too much.

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.120
No, he didn't say anything.

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.120
He just gave it and he was like, hey, look.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.120
But that would be a great time for a catchphrase because,

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.120
like, no one's ever going to forget whatever you say there.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.120
You could just be like, no new taxes.

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.120
There shouldn't be new taxes.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:22.120
Like, you could get a guy elected if you ate your own shit and then looked at the camera

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.120
and were like, remember this.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:28.120
Do you think it's a kid being guilty about poopies or he's starving?

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.120
Like, feed me more food.

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.120
What was his thing?

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.120
Yeah.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.120
I think he was just an adventurous kid that was like,

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.120
let's see what this is about.

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.120
Well, you know, I mean...

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.120
Oh, no.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.120
Freud's big thing was like...

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:46.120
I mean, I think Freud's been sort of like discredited by his...

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.120
the people that came after him, which...

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.120
And I think a little too much because it's not like we all question Ben Franklin

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.120
when we talk about electricity.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:56.120
Like, Freud was the first guy to go, what if your brain is complicated?

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.120
And before that, it was just like, you're a lady.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.120
You should lay down.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.120
You're hysterical.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.120
Your uterus is making you crazy.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:06.120
And Freud was like, no, what if there's like a bunch of shit in your brain

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.120
that you don't even understand and why we should take shits on him

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.120
because he also said we all want to fuck our moms.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.120
I don't know.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.120
But anyways, that was my Freud defense segment.

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:23.120
But Freud's thing was like, what is the first thing you ever do as a sentient mammal?

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:27.120
Other mammals, deer are born and they start walking

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.120
and kids are like, we're born conscious.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.120
And we may not be born moral, but we're born conscious and sentient.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:38.120
And then the first thing that happens is you make something.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:42.120
You make something that's not you, but you made it, it came out of you.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.120
And so things can happen.

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:48.120
Freud's theory was that things are happening formatively to you,

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:52.120
depending on the attitudes in your world toward the thing you made.

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:56.120
And then the other things, the things you put in your mouth is like,

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.120
that's all you can do.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.120
You grab things and you stick them in your mouth.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.120
How do people react to that?

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.120
How do you feel about that?

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.120
And you make a duty and you've heard those phrases,

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:08.120
the anal fixation and the oral fixation and stuff.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:11.120
But anyways, I believe that's totally valid.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.120
That's the stuff that makes sense.

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:17.120
The penis plunger, I don't doubt it, but it's so specific.

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.120
We have our episode title, I know that.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.120
Simple things make sense to me.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.120
Oh yeah, your mom's the first person,

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.120
your first woman you meet and your dad's the first man you meet.

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.120
You can't really argue with the simplicity of that.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.120
You can then argue about neuroplasticity and whether or not

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.120
you still have a chance to overcome your nurture and your nature.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:42.120
But it's still like simple shit makes sense to me.

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:45.120
You take a shit when you have shit on your hand in the crib

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.120
and then you're like, probably,

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.120
I'm sure we all ate our own shit at some point.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:53.120
We just didn't get caught and didn't do it like a weird cartoon,

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:55.120
like a Heathcliff cartoon.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.120
He's got a turd and he goes like this

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.120
and then there's a fish bone comes out.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.120
This guy took it to a Popeye place.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:09.120
He deserves the shame that he probably still lives with.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:12.120
How, as the cousin you said, what was he?

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.120
Yeah, what's his first and last name?

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.120
I mean, what town does he live in?

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.120
How has he adjusted? Has he grown up into a happy, healthy human being?

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.120
Oh yeah, he's a doctor.

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.120
Well, who are some of his patients?

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.120
Maybe they're listeners.

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:32.120
He's a radiologist who are like, I think they're like, yeah.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.120
Look at X-rays.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.120
And they're in charge of whether or not you get over or under-radiated

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.120
when you're, so someone out there

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.120
doesn't know that the guy at the button

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:44.120
wants ate his own shit out of the toilet.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.120
Yeah.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.120
Do you remember when you...

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.120
I don't have any memories of potty training.

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.120
Spencer, I also...

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.120
Are you okay? Do you want to talk about your poopies?

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.120
No, I just had to pee.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.120
That was a pee. He was gone for 45 seconds.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.120
Oh, okay, you just had to pee, okay.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.120
He came back like a ghost. It was amazing.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.120
Oh yeah, I may or may not have a kidney stone,

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.120
so I've been drinking water.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.120
Holy shit, yeah, that's right.

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.120
Yeah, I was going to ask him for notes, you know,

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.120
get some tips.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.120
Don't ask him, he's had him like four times.

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.120
Yeah.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.120
That would be fine.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.120
We got to get Spencer health coverage.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.120
He texted me over the...

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.120
It's fine.

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.120
A couple of days ago, it was like four in the morning

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.120
and you were like, holy shit.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.120
He had this terrible pain in his gut

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.120
because... Yeah, because you hear horror stories

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.120
that's like, I broke my foot

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.120
and they charged me $20,000.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.120
You know, I don't know.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.120
You got to go in.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.120
No, I went to the doctor. They said I had a kidney stone,

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.120
but, you know, who knows what they know?

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.120
How did they figure out that you had a kidney stone?

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.120
Because if they touched my appendix

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.120
and it didn't feel like it exploded

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.120
in my body,

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.120
I didn't have an appendix problem

01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.120
and, you know, your intestine

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.120
just denied infection.

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.120
So those are the things that can happen

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.120
in your bladder.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.120
That's a great song.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.120
So, yeah.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.120
Peek and form, but so can stalactites.

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.120
A calcium that

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.120
turn into shards and that's one thing

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:19.120
that women have better than us.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.120
It's the one thing.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.120
70% of the wages

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.120
for the same job.

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.120
No maternity leave

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.120
but

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.120
you don't have

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:35.120
shards of calcium

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.120
ninja star shape

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.120
bone fragments

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.120
a Cronenbergian

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.120
weapon

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.120
trying to fit through

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.120
a diameter of a drinking straw.

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.120
A cocktail straw, like a little tiny

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.120
cocktail straw.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.120
A fucking

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:57.120
a ninja star

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.120
the size of a marble.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.120
Can I please right now

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.120
send this out there to the ether that

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.120
the guy that did the tie bricks to the theme song

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.120
put music to that right there.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.120
Well, I don't know if there was any meter to that.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.120
I was really impressed. Oh, there was plenty of meter.

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:13.120
That guy who did the thing for the

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.120
gynees, when I was the guy like those

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.120
gynees, those gynees.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.120
When we were talking about misogyny

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.120
and phylogeny

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.120
phylogeny is when you

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.120
realize the misogyny

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.120
wait, what was my epiphany?

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.120
That fill

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.120
the fill in philanthropy

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.120
that it's like, oh, it's the same as the fill

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.120
it's the file

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.120
it's the file, like at the end of

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.120
people who fuck different things, file

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:41.120
fill Philadelphia file

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.120
Philanthropy versus misanthropy

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.120
and then misogyny

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.120
there is no phylogeny

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.120
it's not even possible as far as I know

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.120
best you can do is get along

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:53.120
with him at work

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.120
but I was like, oh, so phylogeny

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.120
would be that you like the gynees

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.120
and then I watched into it

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:01.120
those gynees, gotta get

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.120
those gynees and then like

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.120
why am I explaining this?

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.120
I was to miss that show

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.120
that's not rigging any bells for me.

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.120
I think you were here.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.120
Ridley I think was coming. I wasn't there for that one.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.120
No, no, no, you were sitting there because

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.120
I was talking to Philanthropy

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.120
about Jesus Christ we're drunk.

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.120
I didn't mean drunk like long term

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.120
that sounds like a short bit

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.120
but I didn't realize somebody made music to it

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.120
I tweeted it

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.120
and I think I see

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.120
or I didn't retweet it because it sounds like

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.120
I like those Chinese

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.120
it's distracting for that reason

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.120
to the extent that you listen to it

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.120
because I go like how do you do it

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.120
you got a hole where your wiener should be

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.120
and if I retweeted it

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.120
the wrong

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.120
kind of people would have come out of the woodwork

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.120
hearing it out of context

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.120
they would have just been like so

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.120
hello, haven't seen you since the rape joke

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:55.120
like

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.120
I don't listen to your show, don't know who you are

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.120
get you confused with

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.120
everyone else but

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.120
there's a hole where your wiener should be

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.120
that's great

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.120
but it came out great you should listen to it

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.120
it's a great song

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.120
I love it, I can't wait

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.120
there's a hole where your wiener should be

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.120
wiener as a hole

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.120
that's a go-to for me

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.120
I've used that phrase a lot

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.120
that's my

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.120
that's my ironic

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.120
misogynistic

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:27.120
you don't see a wiener as another kind of hole

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.120
the joke is that I don't

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.120
the joke is

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.120
where your wiener should be, that's the joke

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.120
you're right, I'm in a bad mood

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.120
I don't like you guys today

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.120
you're doing great Dan

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.120
you are doing great

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:45.120
but you're a little on edge today

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.120
I'm on edge

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.120
you feel a little edgy

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.120
what a lovely day

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.120
do you think that

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.120
I was saying that during a lovely day

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.120
do you think that it could be as simple as

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.120
just having played an edgy video game all afternoon

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:59.120
that could make your mood a little edgy

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.120
my therapist says when I'm playing video games

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:03.120
I'm not actually

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.120
it took her a while to her credit to start

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.120
getting after the video game thing

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.120
but she says

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.120
from the description of what you're doing

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.120
when you're playing video games or what you do when you're at work

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.120
it sounds like you're not taking a break

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.120
from work so much as you are

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.120
feeding an addiction to a heightened

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.120
state of nervousness

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.120
like your nervous system

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.120
you need to meditate and calm down

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.120
and I have found

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.120
that that works

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.120
but I don't want to

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:33.120
the way I don't want to take a shower

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.120
you don't want to do things that are good for you

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.120
when you're in an addicted state

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.120
so I'm coming home from work

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.120
and I'm like I don't want to think about anything

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.120
but I definitely my nervous system

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.120
is at a six instead of a zero

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.120
so it goes to nine

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.120
the

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.120
ten is

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.120
you get a cooking show

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.120
if I just keep talking they'll think it's an awesome

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.120
reference no one will ever know

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.120
there's so many cooking shows by the time they get to the bottom

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.120
listen there's no such thing as a famous nervous cook

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:05.120
I'm like see you later sucker

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.120
I got your laugh

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.120
I'm out of town

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.120
the

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.120
but I didn't

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.120
I stopped down and explained that

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.120
and now I forgot what I was saying

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.120
oh yeah because I described her

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.120
she's like what do you do at work and I go

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.120
I'm not writing one thing right now

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.120
I'm helping a guy out with the script

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.120
it took me 20 minutes to describe what I'm doing right now

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:29.120
because it's a lot of work a lot of jobs

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.120
a lot of different jobs I like that it's a lot of jobs

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.120
I didn't like focusing on one thing

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:35.120
and she's like so when you relax

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.120
what do you do is I play video games

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.120
and she's like what kind of video games

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.120
and I said well I can play Witcher 3 right now

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.120
and she says well what is that like

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.120
and I said well it's like

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.120
how much detail did you go into

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.120
well you're like a witcher

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.120
and you're not going to go

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.120
and you get these side quests

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.120
and she's like if we were living

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:57.120
in a time with

01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.120
witches I wouldn't know

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.120
which of those you just described

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.120
which the break you were taking

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:05.120
you know like what do you

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.120
sounds like you're you may be like

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.120
actually just feeding a

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:11.120
you know you're amped up and then you're like

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:13.120
you want to stay there

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.120
there was something you said real quick

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:17.120
do you meditate? I do now

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.120
and what is that like?

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.120
breathing

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.120
but on purpose

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.120
it's the first time that's ever been asked

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.120
to anyone I can retire

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.120
you know

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.120
you're just breathing you're focusing your mind

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.120
on the same thing your body is always focused on

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.120
so they get on the same page

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.120
if you just keep breathing

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.120
and try to stop thinking about things

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.120
but you also don't punish yourself for thinking about things

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.120
your mind is all warmed up

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:47.120
get your nervous system down to a zero level

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:49.120
so that everything that's happening

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.120
is happening for the first time

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.120
as far as your body is concerned

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.120
that way if something frustrating happens to you

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.120
that's like a level of three frustration

01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.120
and a zero

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:01.120
it pumps you up to a three

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.120
much easier to get down to a zero from a three

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.120
if you're at a six and a three happens

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.120
you get a cooking show

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.120
where did you learn

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.120
how to cook?

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.120
where did I what?

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:15.120
where did you learn the meditation is there a teacher?

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.120
it's just breathing it's not rocket science

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.120
well I used to do it when I was very combative

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.120
what level are you at now

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:25.120
is this a zero?

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.120
I'm at a six definitely

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.120
what a lovely day

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.120
I'm only partially joking

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.120
I went and saw the three road

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.120
I might have mentioned this when we talked about it on the show before

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.120
when I drove home I was disappointed

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:43.120
that people weren't trying to ram me off the road

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:45.120
on Hollywood Boulevard

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.120
we're supposed to be at war

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.120
when I'm behind the wheel

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.120
it was two hours of wheels

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.120
and exhaust and flame

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.120
and I was like this drive home is so peaceful

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.120
I was like it didn't make any sense

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.120
I missed the time that that's from you playing what

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:01.120
that's from me watching the movie

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.120
or watching the movie just being in the theater

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.120
and you go home like oh I'm driving home right now

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.120
and everybody's playing by the rules

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.120
and being polite and stopping when the light is red

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.120
and it was like it was it was it was strange

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.120
like to shake yourself

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.120
out a little bit of that thing that you just been immersed into

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.120
so I can't imagine

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.120
when you play a video game you play it for

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.120
four or six hours sometimes

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.120
I can't see how that would not affect

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.120
yeah it's uh

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.120
I don't know what I'm getting out of it sometimes

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:29.120
like I'm definitely being entertained

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.120
and it's positive in some way

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.120
but I don't know if I'm getting the kind of break that I need

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:35.120
it's not a break I think it's

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.120
what we need to recognize is that you're

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.120
you're going into a different room

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.120
like you're shutting out your real life

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.120
but that's different from taking a break

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:45.120
you're not refilling

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.120
your

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.120
your energy

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:51.120
you're just you're just you're just

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:53.120
putting an ice pad I don't know like what the metaphor would be

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.120
like you're you're just like

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.120
you're just disconnecting

01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.120
it's true if I'm working a lot

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:01.120
then I can't really play an intense video game

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.120
which means it comes from the same like reservoir

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.120
of energy or whatever it is

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.120
so when I'm like working a lot

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.120
I just play very repetitive video games

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.120
that require no

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.120
skill or concentration

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.120
but then when I'm not working

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.120
then I'll play like Witcher or Metal Gear

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.120
or something

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.120
yeah and you know what you never do because

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:23.120
you don't like go and sit in the chair

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.120
and put your hands on your laps and stare forward

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.120
and just like take four second deep breaths

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:29.120
and let them out

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.120
for like

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.120
because it doesn't feel like you could ever

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.120
like it feels like that would be

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:37.120
that would make you worse at your job

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:39.120
or worse at like

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.120
it would definitely make you better

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.120
like it definitely does because then you're like

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.120
it's not like you become like the sugar bear where you're like

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.120
goona

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.120
no I do that I'll say it quietly

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.120
and just like check twitter

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:53.120
or something I totally do that

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.120
that's relaxing checking twitter

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:57.120
yeah

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.120
that's definitely always relaxes me

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.120
I'm definitely going there for relaxation

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.120
alright well let's

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.120
bring out Demorige and

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:07.120
Demorige Brown

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:11.120
Demorige Brown

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.120
hey whatever happened to the fucking little cuties

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.120
they're here

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.120
god damn it

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.120
have we forgotten somebody

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.120
well we forgot I mean we forgot the

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.120
guests that we had tonight but in my

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:25.120
defense they were not here when I took the stage

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.120
so I kind of forgot about them

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.120
but they're right here they've been there

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.120
okay

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.120
there's two of them so

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.120
I would gladly go back

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.120
no I'm telling you right now

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.120
I know David Horowitz as well

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.120
but I'm not sure

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:43.120
we gotta talk to the little cuties

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.120
because there's people here

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.120
Demorige will be right back

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.120
no don't worry about it

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:51.120
are they not down the street

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.120
no they're right back there

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.120
I can see them please welcome Dave Horowitz

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.120
and Shawn Perlman

01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.120
yeah Demorige

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.120
we kicked him off I'm so sorry

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.120
I'm so sorry guys

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.120
we got here like 804

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.120
I hope you didn't think we weren't here

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.120
we were here we heard the whole show

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.120
a lot of jizz talk

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.120
okay what were they talking about at 804

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.120
we all read the minutes

01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.120
right now

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.120
they were here

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:29.120
which you did

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.120
I'm very sorry

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:33.120
but I don't feel as bad because you weren't here

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.120
but

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.120
it evens out I'm not mad

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.120
that you weren't here it just allows me to not feel

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.120
as bad as I should for forgetting to bring you up

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.120
this is good it's positive

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.120
yeah we're at it

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:47.120
as mad as a positive

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:49.120
no it's totally good he's neutral right

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:51.120
yeah yeah neutral I'm at a zero

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.120
in terms of my relationship to them

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:55.120
my nervous system's at a six

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:57.120
it didn't help or hurt your

01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:59.120
nervous I did want to read

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.120
I wanted to read some of Shawn Perlman's tweets

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:03.120
but no just go to Shawn Perlman's twitter

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:05.120
it's funny

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:07.120
he's one of those funny tweeters

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:09.120
Shawn what's the handle so that we can find it

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.120
it's Shawn Perlman

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:13.120
Perlman as Perl as an oyster

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:15.120
Perl and man

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.120
my name

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.120
there was so much more confusing than that

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.120
Shawn

01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:23.120
it sounds like you're on a terrible date

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:27.120
as a man my name

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.120
Dan what makes Shawn's tweets so special to you

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:33.120
I can't I don't want to butcher his jokes

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.120
but he said one of them was like

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:37.120
I'm really into religious texts

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:39.120
recently like this one I got at

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.120
2 a.m. from my priest that said you up

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.120
now I know how that's going to go out

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.120
on a date

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:49.120
that'll work yeah

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.120
religious texts

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.120
we've had that phrase forever I've never connected those

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.120
and also a little

01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:59.120
anti-catholic like subversion in there too

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.120
I didn't even pick up on that

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:03.120
finally we're giving it to those guys

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.120
I don't want to cause controversy

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:09.120
I'm going to delete it now

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:11.120
it's a catholic show but we're more Jesuit

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.120
so we're open to

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.120
so

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.120
you guys have a podcast called the little cuties

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.120
yeah here on feral audio

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.120
that's here for Dustin Marshall

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:23.120
Dustin Marshall

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.120
Dustin

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.120
Dustin

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.120
what do the little cuties do

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:31.120
the little cuties

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:33.120
what do the little cuties not do

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:35.120
my question

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.120
answer mine first

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.120
okay

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.120
well they do not

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.120
behave like adults a lot of the time

01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:45.120
not yet

01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:47.120
so maybe if they wear button down shirts

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:49.120
they also come

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:51.120
to this show on a giant cocktail

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:53.120
of cold medicine

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:55.120
which I am on

01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.120
which is fine but also

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.120
maybe you are eating habits

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:01.120
aren't super results one time

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:03.120
I ate Sean's three week old birthday cake

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:05.120
for dinner

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:07.120
that's just like the kind of stuff

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:09.120
that's so many mistakes in one

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.120
just two

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:13.120
cake for dinner

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.120
three weeks old

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:17.120
my birthday cake

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:19.120
and you told me there was a sign

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.120
I said Dave don't eat this cake

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.120
this is you, I'm talking to you Dave Horowitz

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:25.120
Dave is bound and gagged

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:27.120
I was eating my birthday cake

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.120
laughing at my face

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.120
part of that story is made up

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:33.120
the thing I would be most excited to talk to you guys

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.120
about but we can't

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:37.120
because we had dinner

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:39.120
because I have a studio and we talked about that idea

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:41.120
but I want to make it into a

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:43.120
cartoon so we can't talk about it

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:45.120
why did I bring it up

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.120
all this for the podcast

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.120
what do you guys talk about on the podcast

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:51.120
we talk about regret

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.120
we have a lot of regrets as two men

01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:55.120
we talk about being

01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.120
we're both 32 years of age

01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:59.120
we're both trying to

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.120
maybe act a little bit more adult

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.120
we reached a point in our life where we can't get away with

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:05.120
quite as much anymore

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:07.120
we still feel like

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.120
little babies but we're not

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.120
people expect more of us so

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.120
we're just trying to be better human beings

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.120
and so we invite people on who may or may not be

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:17.120
grown up and then we sort of ask them

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.120
are you an adult or are you a little cutie

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.120
which we could pause it to the group

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:23.120
it took us a few episodes

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:25.120
to actually

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.120
solidify the definition of little cuties

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.120
so

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:31.120
a little bit but then we got there

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.120
I was trying to make a big

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.120
all-encompassing life philosophy

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.120
which I realized

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:39.120
three episodes and I wasn't smart enough to do

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.120
I wasn't even included in that

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.120
so I felt like

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.120
so yeah

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:47.120
then somewhere on the fourth episode we went to a stand up show

01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:49.120
and we got into a big fight

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.120
and just had like this big

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.120
long drawn out thing

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.120
in the back of like a brewery

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:57.120
where there was a stand up show

01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.120
and we realized like

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.120
this isn't worth it

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.120
it's not worth it to fight

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.120
a real fight

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:07.120
a real emotional

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.120
it was the worst fight we've ever had

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.120
but it was also the only fight we've ever had

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:13.120
how long have you guys known each other

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:15.120
seven or eight years

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:17.120
and we've been coming on married for six

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:19.120
he's nervous

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.120
the word little cuties

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.120
is that a joke you've been

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.120
called in the past?

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:27.120
yeah a friend of mine

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.120
used to kind of make fun of me

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:31.120
a little bit, good naturedly

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.120
but anytime I would show up to a party

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:35.120
and like a sweater or a button down shirt

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.120
or just anything that kind of was me trying to

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.120
look a little bit older

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.120
she would just look at me and go

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.120
look at you, look at you little cutie

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.120
and your little sweater

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:47.120
what is that, a button down shirt with a sweater over it

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:49.120
and I was like what does that mean

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:51.120
I'm not allowed to be an adult

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:53.120
and she's like you're just such a little cutie

01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:55.120
and I realized like oh I'm like wearing

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:57.120
the disguise of an adult

01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:59.120
but I would say that you would also

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.120
I've known you for a little while

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.120
that you might be a successful

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:05.120
65, 75, 85 year old

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.120
gentleman with loads of

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.120
no he's 32

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:11.120
sorry

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:13.120
do I look older?

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:15.120
as your life goes on

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:17.120
you might be a successful

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.120
man

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:21.120
and people still go that's a little cutie

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.120
that might just be something essentially

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.120
who you both might be

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:27.120
you might be eternal little cuties

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.120
which is one of the greatest things

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.120
that you might be

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:33.120
somebody odd which is the kind of thing we're going for

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.120
which is good

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:37.120
it's an inside job

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.120
we can sneak a couple of those through

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.120
we sort of wanted the aesthetic of

01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.120
on these little bodies

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:45.120
and we're looking up at legs

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:47.120
opening the door and catching us

01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:49.120
through mischief

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.120
but our mischief is not knowing how to text a girl back

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.120
or freaking out over a job

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.120
I understand I should have

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:57.120
consumed the material

01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.120
before we talked about your

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.120
material on the show

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:03.120
but I don't understand the format

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:05.120
are you guys in front of a microphone

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.120
talking about the stuff where are you

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:09.120
actually

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.120
is it a fictional narrative

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:13.120
it's a live podcast

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:15.120
it's gone once they stop

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.120
talking

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.120
when the clock runs out

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:21.120
then we're done

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:23.120
we do it at Griffith Park at midnight

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.120
you little cuties

01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.120
see

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:29.120
maybe if you don't understand the format

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.120
it's because we're not super locked into one yet

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:33.120
we've only had 12 episodes

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.120
we've had a couple of guests

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.120
we just kind of have a free flowing interview

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.120
the first 20 or so minutes

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:41.120
we get to know our guests

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.120
we get to see what kind of behavior

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.120
makes up their life if they consider themselves

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:47.120
an adult

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:49.120
what kind of behavior they exhibit

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:51.120
we have some arbitrary like do you live alone

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.120
or do you have a long term partner

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.120
do you have a stable employment

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:57.120
so far only one person

01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:59.120
is identified as an adult

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:01.120
who was it

01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:03.120
I'm your Blumenfeld

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.120
I would not have thought of him as an adult

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:07.120
you're very confident

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:09.120
you're anxious and weird like us

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.120
and he's like no I got everything under control

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.120
okay got it

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.120
Camille do you feel like an adult

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.120
or a little cutie

01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:19.120
I don't know if I'm committing myself to

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.120
that term

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:23.120
it might feel good if you say it

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:25.120
pretty sure it's not going to feel good

01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:27.120
I feel like a big fat mountain of tits

01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.120
that is the third option

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.120
we have

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.120
I was going to suggest you add that

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.120
because I guess I'm a baby

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:37.120
in the sense that I'm a big

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:39.120
that's on the secret venue

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:41.120
secret venue

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:45.120
Spencer do you feel like an adult

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:47.120
sure yeah

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:49.120
you do

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:51.120
confidently

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.120
well here's the thing you guys

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:55.120
I think of myself

01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.120
as like a kid

01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.120
when I'm not paying attention

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.120
you know like I see a couple kids

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:03.120
and I'm like oh check out those kids

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:05.120
I'm 27

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:09.120
you know

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.120
we're not both kids together

01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:13.120
you see kids and you identify with them

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.120
and you go yeah these are my people

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:17.120
yeah they're not going to arrest me for smoking pot

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:19.120
they're not going to call the cops

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:21.120
what kind of how old is a kid in your mind though

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.120
like if you said I'm looking at a kid

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.120
how old is that kid

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.120
straight 14

01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.120
we're on the same level

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.120
so that's the

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:33.120
then you're a little cutie you're not in

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.120
well that's when I'm not paying attention

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.120
but otherwise I just feel like yeah

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:39.120
it's not like I'm not going around my life

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:41.120
like being childish

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.120
I'm not super

01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:45.120
up on how

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:47.120
you know how mortgages work

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:49.120
or what a credit limit is

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.120
or you know

01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.120
stuff like that but I mean I

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.120
do you know what your credit score is

01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:57.120
it happens to be 750

01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.120
he's an adult

01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:01.120
that's nice dude

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.120
is that good? 750 is very

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:05.120
it's a good solid score

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:07.120
mine was in the 500

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:09.120
oh man yeah

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:11.120
I don't think it is anymore but it works

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:13.120
yeah mine's not 750

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.120
that's from a commercial I saw

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.120
you little cutie

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.120
you're a little cutie

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:21.120
it's like that

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.120
it's like that joke

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.120
though you might be a redneck

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.120
little cutie

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.120
if you don't know your own credit score

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.120
I might be a little cute

01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:33.120
if you got your credit score from a commercial

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:35.120
you might be a little cute

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:37.120
if you see a 14 year old and you're like

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.120
that's like me

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:41.120
you might be a little cute

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.120
now David and Sean are you guys

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:45.120
using this to strive to be adults

01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:47.120
or do you want to remain little cuties

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.120
are you asking the universe whether or not

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.120
this or that kind of situation

01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.120
we hope that there is like

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.120
to our podcast that over time

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.120
we'll graduate as adults

01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:59.120
in the final episode

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:01.120
I feel like we've already made strides when we started it

01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.120
I was a sad

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.120
unemployed man

01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.120
just a beaten down old soul

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:09.120
now I'm employed

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.120
I'm in a healthy wonderful relationship

01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.120
I bought these shoes

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.120
it's bad radio

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.120
but they're nice shoes

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:19.120
one person agrees

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:21.120
it sounds like you're becoming an adult

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.120
but your shoes say a little cutie

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.120
see?

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:27.120
we're trying to confuse you now

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.120
I think that you know

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.120
that you, here's my prediction

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.120
Sean stays a little cutie all the way through

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.120
you turn into the Walter Matthow

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:37.120
and your shoes

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.120
you're always going to find a way to add on

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.120
one little cutie aspect of yourself

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:43.120
to deny yourself of your adulthood

01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.120
I think I'll just start wearing much brighter colors

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:47.120
the more white my hair starts going

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:49.120
so when I'm full Steve Martin

01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.120
and then all bets are off

01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:53.120
lots of events in your category

01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:55.120
in the Mountain of Ted's secret menu realm

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:57.120
alright

01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.120
so

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:01.120
I think I have to say

01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:03.120
the little cuties should come back next week or something

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:05.120
so we can have them be a littler

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.120
and more cute for a longer time with us

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:09.120
because I fucked them over

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:11.120
I forgot that they existed until

01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:13.120
it was time to start playing D&D

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:15.120
we'll get out of here

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.120
I'll say this though, of all the people that we brought on

01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.120
the podcast, some whom I know

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:21.120
and some whom I do not, I want to listen to little cuties

01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:23.120
I like this premise

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:25.120
I mean that's the important thing, it's a feral audio podcast

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.120
now you can start listening to it, we'll have the little cuties on

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:29.120
next week or something

01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:31.120
What are you Jeff? You've asked everyone

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:33.120
what about you?

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:35.120
I would say probably an adult

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:37.120
but that won't grow up in a certain way

01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:39.120
but I wouldn't call those ways little cutie ways

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.120
I think that I'm kind of an eternal

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.120
okay I'll just say adult

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.120
when I was 4, I felt 40

01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.120
if I live to be 90

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.120
I will be a 40 year old

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.120
you're a little 40

01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:53.120
you're a little 40

01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:55.120
you're a little 40

01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.120
a 4 year old

01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:59.120
that knows how to tie his own tie

01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:01.120
I felt like an adult

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.120
wow you were this the whole time

01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:05.120
that makes so much sense

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.120
it really does

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:09.120
like a little 4 year old Jeff Davis

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:11.120
what we talked about, there's a picture of you

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:13.120
when you were like a kid actor

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:15.120
stunning

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:17.120
I was a little cutie when I was a kid

01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.120
yeah you but

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:21.120
I was also an adult

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:23.120
I was breaking home the fucking

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:25.120
bacon

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:27.120
all right you are, King and I

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.120
well let's send the little cuties to their room

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:31.120
and demorge back out

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:33.120
all right we're grounded, thanks guys

01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:35.120
we'll have you back little cuties, sorry guys

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.120
I'll make it up to you

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:43.120
they're little cuties

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:45.120
they're easy to abuse because they're little cuties

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.120
DeMorge Brown get back at her would you

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:49.120
applause

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:51.120
applause

01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:53.120
sorry about that demorge

01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:55.120
I'm all apologies tonight

01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:57.120
that's the title of the podcast

01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:59.120
what else can I be

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.120
oh no no no we're gonna get

01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:03.120
Shazam scanned and blocked

01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.120
by Universal Records

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:07.120
you sang the entire Highlander song

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:09.120
that was a damn bit older

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.120
when I was in high school

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.120
among the things that we loved

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.120
to freak out about was that Highlander song

01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:17.120
oh yeah

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:19.120
you guys have never seen the video

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:21.120
oh no is Johnny Cash in space

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:23.120
there are two of them

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.120
one of them is the official video

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:27.120
which I think was the video they made

01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:29.120
in the style of Iron Maiden's The Trooper

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:31.120
it's a black and white Conestoga wagon freak out

01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:33.120
where they took the clouds and isolated them somehow

01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:35.120
upside down and then time-lapse them

01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:37.120
so they're churning

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:39.120
it's a long time ago

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:41.120
but when Cash shows up

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.120
his face appears in space

01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:45.120
so he's just in the clouds

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:47.120
telling you about the Starship

01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.120
I'm appearing via satellite

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:51.120
Willie I can't make it to the shoot

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:53.120
that's alright

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.120
you can be in space you say you're a space man

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.120
thanks Willie

01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.120
it's sort of like a solid goal

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.120
produced type performance

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:03.120
some countries start to get a hit

01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:05.120
they give them a summer special for episodes

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:07.120
and there's one I think

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:09.120
it just looks like they're standing there

01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:11.120
and everything's green screen

01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.120
and then when it gets to Cash

01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:15.120
all the windows turn to space

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:17.120
and he's wearing a long coat

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:19.120
and then they put chrome on it or something

01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:21.120
and he's the only one who doesn't move

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.120
so when he's saying I fly a Starship

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.120
only his cheeks are kind of vibrating

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:29.120
the Starship has no windshield

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:31.120
it's something like that

01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.120
but it has stability control so you can stand on it

01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:35.120
and just kind of ride it like a skateboard

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.120
like a Segway

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.120
like a Huffwitz Coif

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:41.120
alright so are you a little cutie

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:43.120
you're not a little cutie

01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.120
there's nothing little about me

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:47.120
let's get the shadow on

01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:49.120
let's skew female

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:51.120
in the choosing of a helper

01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:53.120
you can be someone who's

01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:55.120
presenting as female

01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:57.120
you can be having a female day

01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:59.120
you can have an inner chromosome

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.120
but I'm not going to pick you if you look like a dude

01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:03.120
because we've had too many

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:05.120
anybody

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:07.120
that hasn't been up here before

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:09.120
that's feeling feminine

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:11.120
a blonde girl

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:13.120
what's your name? Marissa

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:15.120
come join us Marissa would you

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.120
I'm just

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:21.120
I'm handing these

01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:25.120
and I believe you'll be playing

01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.120
McGathey's character

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:29.120
Mercy O'Donnell

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.120
because we have the original Dr. Friend

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:33.120
here and we certainly have our hordegard

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.120
Camille you've only played Dr. Friend

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:37.120
how many times?

01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:39.120
he hasn't

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.120
I have

01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:43.120
you explained your character but never played

01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:45.120
okay sure that makes sense

01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:47.120
no I played once

01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:49.120
I don't think so

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.120
you might have

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:53.120
I think once

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:55.120
thanks for coming up Marissa

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:57.120
so best behavior guys let's really

01:46:57.120 --> 01:46:59.120
knock this role playing out of the park

01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:01.120
Alan Wu is here

01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:03.120
observing he's going to direct Harmon Quest

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.120
so he's like where would I put

01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:07.120
the camera and what is this show

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.120
I already warned him it's a mess

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.120
don't come to the Harmontown Show

01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.120
and think that it's what we do but I also

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:15.120
think we could knock it out of the park

01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:17.120
in our minds we play this game for a half hour

01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:19.120
every show but we only play it for 45 seconds

01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:21.120
and nothing ever happens

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:23.120
except then because we're all black

01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:25.120
out drunk at the end of the show

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.120
I was just in the green room with Spencer

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:29.120
he was describing what happened last time

01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.120
I was like I don't remember any of that

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.120
about the MP3's and stuff

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.120
so we have to really listen to his recap

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:37.120
Spencer you ready for a recap?

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:39.120
okay I'm not going to ask too many questions or anything

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:41.120
I'm just going to play along because you don't have much time

01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:43.120
do you know what we're doing Marissa or did you just come up with this?

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:45.120
no I know what we're doing

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.120
I know exactly what we're doing

01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:49.120
thank you for helping

01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.120
alright this one's done by Chris Miller

01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:53.120
and he did it

01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:55.120
in Rhyme

01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:57.120
alright

01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.120
I'll just do it

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.120
Jim Nightblade now founded obscene

01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:03.120
the failures be set by his team

01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.120
their briefcase was empty

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.120
his conscious weight hefty

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:09.120
and mercy couldn't even shit while remaining unseen

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:11.120
so the gang met at Old Hexalon

01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:13.120
to put on an old

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.120
70's band on

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:17.120
that's my fault

01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.120
but the jukebox was vapid

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:21.120
and Old Hank was rapid to suggest an adventure

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.120
that might not be canon

01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:25.120
so our runners

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.120
trek to an academy for the help of

01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:29.120
some much gifted progeny

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:31.120
with their persistent

01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:33.120
assistants at Hank's grade insistence

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.120
they'd have a song that would say open sesame

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.120
thank you

01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:39.120
wow

01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:41.120
wow

01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.120
Dan

01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:45.120
did that help you out?

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:47.120
I would like to discourage that behavior in the future

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.120
if you're writing a recap

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:51.120
I would like to

01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:53.120
go for content over style

01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:55.120
yeah this recap

01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:57.120
is all in Portuguese

01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:59.120
nobody's listening to these recaps

01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.120
more intently than me

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:03.120
because I was drunk last week

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:05.120
when I played and now I'm drunk this week

01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:07.120
and I'm like what did that drunk guy do

01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:09.120
we have to come up with a song that cracks a code

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:11.120
what?

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:13.120
we were all trying to write an awesome song

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.120
nope

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:17.120
you were trying to find a song that cracks a code

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:19.120
fuck that doesn't ring any bells

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:21.120
well you know what's going on Marissa

01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:23.120
I think that was snuck in at the end

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:25.120
like the last second

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:27.120
you're standing in the academy

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:29.120
of a gifted art students

01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.120
in front of several small

01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:33.120
creepy looking children

01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.120
you've just shown them what you got

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:37.120
for no reason

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:39.120
and with no introduction

01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:41.120
we sang for them

01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:43.120
yeah

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:45.120
was I here for this one?

01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:47.120
dude it was a blackout

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:49.120
straight blackout

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:51.120
it was all over the shop

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:53.120
looking at my notes

01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:55.120
and all I wrote down was

01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:57.120
troll magnet

01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.120
that's all I have

01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:01.120
that was from three ago

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.120
that was from 18 shows

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:05.120
ago

01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.120
I remember a vagina mesh

01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.120
happened at the very end

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:11.120
commercial

01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:13.120
or something

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:15.120
well that was two episodes ago

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.120
Alan is in freefall panic right now

01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.120
he's like I turned down

01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:21.120
a cooking show for this

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:23.120
there was going to be

01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.120
one guy cooking

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:27.120
one camera easiest job in the world

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.120
is that real?

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:31.120
no that's the reference to the most nervous thing possible

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.120
yeah I'm doing a cooking show

01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:35.120
theme

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:37.120
Spencer where are we standing what do we need

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:39.120
Academy of gifted art students

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.120
okay

01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:43.120
alright so let's do this song right

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.120
we gotta find a song to crack the code

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:47.120
you gotta find

01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:49.120
you ask them for help to learn

01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:51.120
how to get perfect pitch

01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:53.120
so you can break the musical locks

01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:55.120
okay let's ask them

01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.120
alright go ahead

01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:59.120
hey so what do we need to do

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:01.120
to break this lock

01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:03.120
oh I don't know what you're talking about

01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:05.120
but if you want to learn how to sing

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:07.120
you throw the ringer

01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:09.120
alright so I have a question for the Game Master

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.120
this lock doesn't really exist

01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:13.120
right we just came to this academy because

01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:15.120
we assumed going on an mp3 mission

01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:17.120
which was made up by somebody that we were going to have to sing

01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:19.120
eventually so we came to the academy to learn how to sing

01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:21.120
yeah the locks exist

01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:23.120
but they're you know they're locking

01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.120
the cargo which you're not needing

01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:27.120
oh okay so we are here for a reason

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.120
are we on a mission right now?

01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:31.120
do we have a Johnson in the net?

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.120
we're gonna get the mp3s back

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:35.120
okay that rings sort of a bell

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:37.120
okay so we are here to learn how to sing

01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:39.120
okay so what did you say

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:41.120
put us through your ringer

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:43.120
I think you'll find out that you little

01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:45.120
whippersnappers have nothing on a

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.120
hardcore seasoned salty

01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:49.120
group of shadow runners any day of the week

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:51.120
alright

01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:53.120
training montage right

01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:55.120
right

01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:57.120
alright

01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.120
alright

01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:01.120
you learn how to sing

01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:03.120
okay

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:05.120
your pitch is perfect

01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:07.120
okay

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.120
kids thank you

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:15.120
thank you

01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:17.120
thank you

01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:21.120
top

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.120
we've achieved three studious level

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:29.120
status on that one

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:31.120
yeah we're not

01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:33.120
cutting an album anytime soon

01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.120
we're not making an entrance as plumbers

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:41.120
yeah we're the most fun plumbers you've ever hired

01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:45.120
alright see you later

01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:47.120
we'll send you a check

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:49.120
oh thanks

01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:51.120
boy that was a tough six days

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:53.120
it felt like seven

01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:57.120
so what do we use this new power

01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:59.120
that we are clearly

01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:01.120
one of the burgeoning hot shot

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:03.120
vocal groups in town

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:05.120
how do we use this to our advantage

01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:07.120
as shadow runners

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.120
well we're going to go on this mission

01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:11.120
that we took on and then I explain what the mission is

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:13.120
via Spencer

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:15.120
in Spencer's voice

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.120
alright so Hank's last stand

01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:19.120
you were there Hank he was explaining that

01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:21.120
the jukebox was all fucked up because he doesn't

01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:23.120
have any of that old style

01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:25.120
mp3's it's all new age garbage

01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:27.120
and so he knew

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:29.120
he knew that in a storage facility

01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:31.120
there was under lock and key

01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:33.120
musical lock and key

01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:35.120
all the mp3 profiles

01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.120
that you could ever ask for

01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:39.120
and how far away

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:41.120
are we from the storage facility

01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:43.120
not far

01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:45.120
shall we call close enough to call in Uber

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:47.120
or close enough to walk

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:49.120
you're close enough to walk

01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:51.120
let's walk we can get to know each other

01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:53.120
I think we should get an Uber anyway

01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:55.120
but you don't want to go through that

01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:57.120
Uber shame thing

01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:59.120
I already called one shit

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:01.120
you know when we can just walk

01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:03.120
if you cancel it nothing will charge you

01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:05.120
five

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:07.120
you'll rate you will go down several stars

01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:09.120
that's right I'm sorry

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:11.120
they're going to lower your rating too

01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:13.120
the Uber arrives

01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:15.120
there's five of us

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:17.120
can you take five

01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:19.120
can you take five

01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:21.120
there's no driver

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:23.120
yes but automated driver

01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:25.120
can you seat five on this thing

01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:27.120
there's five seats

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:29.120
take us to Hank's last stand

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:31.120

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:33.120

01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:43.120

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:45.120
brought to you by Doritos

01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:47.120
when your wife

01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:49.120
takes this Uber

01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:51.120
you will be sexually harassed

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:55.120
no no no

01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:57.120
that's yeah

01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:59.120
I know but they didn't hear it

01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:01.120
you're at Hank's last stand

01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:03.120
hey Hank listen we learned how to sing

01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:05.120
tell me again you want these mp3s

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:07.120
just to make your jukebox the best jukebox in the world

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:09.120
is there a more

01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:11.120
is there an ulterior motive

01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:13.120
when we have good music let me tell you

01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:15.120
the customers

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:17.120
are going to start rolling in

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:19.120
so we should sing to your jukebox now

01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:21.120
to open this thing up and get the mp3s

01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:23.120
no you should not do that

01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:25.120
we should go to the storage facility

01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:27.120
oh right

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:29.120
why did we come here first

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:31.120
I left my

01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:33.120
Apache war hammer here

01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:35.120
how far are we from the storage facility

01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:37.120
now you're 20 minutes

01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:39.120
we were close to that

01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:43.120
might they suggest that we go back

01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:45.120
but that means

01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:47.120
I'm bad wiping us to the next thing

01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:49.120
you're outside of store quest

01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:51.120
okay

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:53.120
it's a storage facility

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:55.120
you can't do that

01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:57.120
you're not the game master

01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:59.120
he manamanamanana

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:01.120
no he did it the first one

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:03.120
he didn't do this manamanamanana

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:05.120
you can't just add manamanamanas

01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:07.120
we'll all stop the Uber

01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:11.120
let's go back in time from Hank's last stand

01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:13.120
we're back in the Uber

01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:15.120
we're back in the Uber

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:21.120
you find yourself outside

01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:23.120
store quest storage facility

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:25.120
I feel like it's as if I've been here before

01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:27.120
you have

01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:29.120
you have a storage facility here

01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:31.120
alright guys brief pep talk

01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:33.120
no no no no no

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:45.120
and that's why I think we'll do great

01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:47.120
wow that was the best pep talk you've ever given

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:49.120
thank you

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:51.120
that was like 45 minutes long

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:53.120
but it went by like that

01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:55.120
you were like Martin Luther King

01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:57.120
remember that

01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:59.120
it was touch and go when I used

01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:03.120
the helicopter metaphors

01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:05.120
is that a helicopter based holocaust

01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:07.120
that's like a little kid

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:09.120
I learned about the holocaust

01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:13.120
okay so let's go in

01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:15.120
to store quest

01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:17.120
to the code area

01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:19.120
where we need to break the code

01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:21.120
are there guards outside the front of storage quest

01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:23.120
no there's cameras

01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:25.120
barbed wire

01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:27.120
that's it

01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:29.120
you're our face person

01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:31.120
why don't you lock up there and use your charms

01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:33.120
and see how far we can get through

01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:35.120
we'll cover you from behind

01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.120
well I would but I think don't we need to sing

01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:39.120
to open this lock

01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:41.120
isn't that what Hank said

01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:43.120
well right now you're just at the customer

01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:45.120
facing entrance

01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:47.120
we have to get into the storage facility

01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:49.120
to find, imagine

01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:51.120
where all the mp3s are being stored

01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:53.120
and Mercy we're all listening

01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:55.120
to you on our comms

01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:57.120
the code is blue

01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:59.120
if you say bluebird

01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:01.120
we'll light the place up

01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:03.120
okay I got it

01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:05.120
so I walk to the customer

01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:07.120
service

01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:09.120
you walk to the door

01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:11.120
and open it there's a guy behind a counter

01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:13.120
he's not paying attention

01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:15.120
oh hello

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:17.120
hey

so you know I hear there's some

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:25.120
mp3s in this building

01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:27.120
got any info on that

01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:29.120

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:31.120
just checking in to suggest

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:33.120
that perhaps that's not very subtle

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.120
oh I'm sorry

01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:37.120

01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:41.120
you're on your own

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:43.120
I get one of those

01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:45.120
I like music

01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:47.120

01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:49.120

01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:53.120
about music

01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:55.120
you ever heard of Freddy Franks

01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:57.120

01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:59.120
yeah all about him

01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:01.120

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:03.120
I got his latest

01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:05.120
data chip

01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:07.120
while you're talking to

01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:09.120
while you're talking to him

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:11.120
I'm crawling on my hands and knees below the counter

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:13.120
don't do this

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:15.120
don't do this

01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:17.120
this is a mission that's the right size

01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:19.120
for us

01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:21.120
back back out

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:23.120
do it do it

01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:25.120
no no come back

01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:27.120
are you saying Camille don't do this

01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:29.120
no I'm telling you did you keep doing it

01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:31.120
you stopped telling him to not do it

01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:33.120
but we just walk into this facility

01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:35.120
this is not like a secret facility

01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:37.120
but there's movement she's infiltrating

01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:39.120
we don't need to infiltrate

01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:41.120
they don't want to just walk into a 7-11

01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:43.120
he's not gonna let us break into a storage facility

01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:45.120
we're not breaking in

01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:47.120
we're entering into the area

01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:49.120
this is going on I'm accessing

01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:51.120
my potential

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:53.120
to dig into cyberware

01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:55.120
to see if there is a digital log that might tell us

01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:57.120
where such contents are manifest

01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:59.120
of some sort that would tell us

01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:01.120
where such things are stored

02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:03.120
great thank you

02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:05.120
now I'm just on my hands and knees below the counter

02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:07.120
I'm several K

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:09.120
so you find some public records

02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:11.120
but nothing specific

02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:13.120
nothing that says anything about the kind of cargo

02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:15.120
a unit might have stored

02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:17.120
something they keep track of

02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:19.120
but the guy he's behind the counter

02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:21.120
and he's looking down at his counter

02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:23.120
and he's like I'm seeing

02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:25.120
is there someone crawling right underneath

02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:27.120
I told you

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:29.120
bluebird bluebird

02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:31.120
I want a narco dart

02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:33.120
this guy

02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:35.120
you can't say bluebird yourself

02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:37.120
I can

02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:41.120
she has to say bluebird

02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:43.120
that was my only job

02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:45.120
a stun baton on this guy

02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:47.120
I just got a stun baton

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:49.120
I'm sorry mercy are you really attacking this guy

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:51.120
I thought we were going to have mercy

02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:53.120
is he behind glass or an enclosure

02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.120
this is a regular counter

02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:57.120
okay I jump up and shoot him in the chest

02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:59.120
oh jesus

02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:01.120
no stun dart

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:03.120
are you shooting him with the stun gun after you've killed him

02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:05.120
no

02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:07.120
because it's going to work

02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:09.120
I jump up and go

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:11.120
storage

02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:13.120
I can't think of anything good

02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:15.120
store this

02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:17.120
store this electricity in your chest

02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:19.120
and I was a zap and I just

02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:21.120
shot gun him right in the chest

02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:23.120
physical agility and acrobatics

02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:25.120
I grab hold of my grenade launch or jump in

02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:27.120
do a combat roll stand up and do

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.120
absolutely nothing

02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:31.120
alright

02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.120
okay I have a code of honor

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:35.120
I can't fight someone who hasn't

02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:37.120
hurt me first

02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:39.120
so I do nothing to the corpse

02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:41.120
we don't know what's happening

02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:43.120
we don't even know if I've stunned this guy yet

02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:45.120
you guys simultaneously

02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.120
stun baton and stun gun him

02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:49.120
right in the heart

02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:51.120
he goes down real hard

02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:57.120
it's a million dollar baby situation

02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:59.120
oh

02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:01.120
I haven't seen that movie but it's not

02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:03.120
it's not Wizard of Oz

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:05.120
it's a laugh riot

02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:07.120
it's a bit of a laugher

02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:09.120
but Morgan Freeman gets what he deserves

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:11.120
which is a bit of screen time

02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:13.120
alright

02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:15.120
so we got this guy down let's move

02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:17.120
let's find this mp3 door

02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:19.120
alright doctor friend is he

02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:21.120
is he dead

02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:23.120
we'll figure it out later

02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:25.120
oh there's no pulse

02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:27.120
yeah

02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:29.120
guys he's dead

02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:31.120
for no reason

02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:33.120
alright let's make it for a reason

02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:35.120
and get those mp3s come on

02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:37.120
move people move people

02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:39.120
look alive

02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:41.120
let's make the poor man's life matter

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:43.120
this is a public facility

02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:45.120
attend him to my pep talk

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:47.120
we're gonna do great

02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:49.120
but we're gonna do great

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:51.120
you walk through the door

02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:53.120
now you're in the actual storage

02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:55.120
we could have walked into this door

02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:57.120
oh he wouldn't have let us through

02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:59.120
would he have let us through

02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:01.120
he has ever visited a storage facility

02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:03.120
it's a commercial public enterprise

02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:05.120
it's a commercial public enterprise

02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:07.120
you can't just go into other people's

02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:09.120
storage unless you're Jody Foster

02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:11.120
you could crawl under and think you have a warrant

02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:13.120
I don't know what that reference is

02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:15.120
silence of the lambs

02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:17.120
using my powers to detect enemies

02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:19.120
I'm

02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:21.120
serving the area to see if there's any threat

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:23.120
but also being a precog I know that there is none

02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:27.120
I just want to be part of the team

02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:29.120
I just want to be part of the team

02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:31.120
I try and give the guy first aid

02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:33.120
well he's dead

02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:37.120
second aid

02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:39.120
that's not

02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:41.120
has that ever been done

02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:43.120
you think that we thought of that by now

02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:45.120
I want you all to stand here

02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:47.120
and look at his face

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:49.120
for 30 seconds

02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.120
before we go in

02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:55.120
we did it

02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:57.120
we looked at his face

02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:59.120
let's find those mp3s

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:01.120
mp3

02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:03.120
mp3

02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:05.120
mp3

02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:07.120
mp3

02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:09.120
okay fuck it we'll get it

02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:11.120
what did those lessons do

02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:13.120
save it for the night

02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:15.120
mp3

02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:17.120
horde guard

02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:19.120
if you're in the system

02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:21.120
find any mysterious

02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:23.120
there's no thing that says there's mp3s in the storage unit

02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:25.120
that's this one

02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:27.120
haven't we been to this specific locker before

02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:29.120
no

02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:31.120
using my ability to

02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:33.120
type in again to

02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:35.120
computer records

02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:37.120
I am looking for anything that seems to be obscured

02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:39.120
in his description

02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:41.120
anything that might be upfuscitative or strange

02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:43.120
and while he's doing that I take off the dead guy's clothes

02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:45.120
and put him on and take his place

02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:47.120
by the way having been a precog

02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:49.120
and looked at his face for 30 seconds

02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:51.120
I can tell you that he was guilty of a precrime

02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:53.120
something terrible to a child

02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:55.120
or a preteen

02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.120
in a month

02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:03.120
wow

02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:05.120
we're heroes

02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:07.120
that's cool

02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:09.120
I wasn't saying I like everything this guy does

02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:11.120
I was just saying he didn't deserve to die in that moment

02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:13.120
I didn't know he was into what he said he was going to be into

02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:15.120
so you're pro

02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:17.120
he's been a friend of mine I would have told him to run

02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:19.120
this is

02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:21.120
no I'm not

02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:23.120
I want to say I'm not pro-rape

02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:25.120
whoa somebody protest too much

02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:27.120
no I'm not

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:29.120
it's almost like you're forcing us to accept

02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:31.120
you're not pro-rape and we don't have anything to say about it

02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:33.120
you guys got lucky that he was

02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:35.120
into rape

02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:37.120
you're being very forceful about this argument right now

02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:39.120
he could have been not into rape we didn't know

02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:41.120
whatever I'm taking off my clothes and I'm putting on this guy's

02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:43.120
you're wearing rape clothes

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.120
and I chose to wear them

02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:49.120
that's what people like you don't understand

02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:51.120
horticard

02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:53.120
no in a rape someone is making a choice

02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:55.120
horticard are you

02:05:55.120 --> 02:05:57.120
in the system

02:05:57.120 --> 02:05:59.120
are you in the system right now

02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:01.120
anyway let's talk

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:03.120
I'm just saying this guy shouldn't have died anyway

02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:05.120
or maybe he should have because he was going to do

02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:07.120
I'm in the system

02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:09.120
but the FTR

02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:11.120
for the record

02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:13.120
anything you would like to know you could possibly know

02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:15.120
so if you are worried about the possibilities of his clothes

02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:17.120
I could tell you what he may be able to do in the future

02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:19.120
but otherwise looking at the system

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:21.120
I can tell you that most of this data

02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:23.120
was put together by

02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:25.120
someone working part-time

02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:27.120
who was going to

02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:29.120
an extension school

02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:31.120
and so the information

02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:33.120
is not complete because this is not their first priority

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:35.120
we need a real hacker

02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:37.120
we need a real hacker

02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:39.120
we need an actual

02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:41.120
someone less empathic

02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:43.120
he's like worried about the guys

02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:45.120
college career

02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:47.120
why do we keep not bringing a hack guy

02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:49.120
the guy who's the hack is in his name

02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:51.120
Kenny can hack a remote hack

02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:53.120
hey guys

02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:55.120
oh shit

02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:57.120
cliffhanger

02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:01.120
so Alan it's kind of like that

02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:03.120
except there's swords

02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:07.120
it's also different

02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:09.120
it'll be in a different room

02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:11.120
different people

02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:13.120
Alison everybody

02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:15.120

thank you Marissa, thank you DeMarce

02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:21.120

Sean Perlman from the Little Cuties

02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:29.120
the sperm team

02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:31.120
the sperm team will

02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:33.120
scoot at Michael

02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:35.120
I think it was a Michael and Dr. Sperm

02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:37.120
and Dr. Sperm

02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:39.120

Justin in the back

02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:49.120
thank you to all the feral audio team

02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:51.120
everybody here at Downcomic once again

02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:55.120
thank you for sticking around in this heat

02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:57.120
drive fast, take chances, we love you dearly
