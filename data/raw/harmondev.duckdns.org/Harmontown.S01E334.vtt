Guys, come on, Greg, Tyler, Tyler. I don't even know the Almond Brothers. I don't\n\n03:20.720 --> 03:24.920\nknow either. I know one's named Greg. Name one more Almond Brothers than Greg and you\n\n03:24.920 --> 03:30.760\nwant a toaster, but you're the one that played tambourine and booked the gigs. That's good.\n\n03:30.760 --> 03:35.880\nThat sounds like me. That's a very big compliment when it comes to self care. Oh, because the\n\n03:35.880 --> 03:42.000\nother almonds are like who cares? I'd rather die. You know that. That's part of your your\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:46.800\nlimited knowledge of the Almond Brothers because I'm at zero. I really don't know. I'm projecting\n\n03:46.800 --> 03:51.760\nit sounds like they play music. Yeah, they play music. Okay, and their brothers. That's\n\n03:51.760 --> 03:58.160\ninteresting. I mean, it's not talk about your tomorrow. I'm getting surgered. Yeah, you're\n\n03:58.160 --> 04:04.240\ngoing in for surgery. Yeah, yeah. I was feeling okay about it until the anesthesia cyst called\n\n04:04.240 --> 04:08.840\nme and it was like you're going to be in pain, but we're hoping to get you from a sharp\n\n04:08.840 --> 04:13.840\nstabbing ripping pain to a dole throbbing pain. I was like Jesus Christ during the surgery\n\n04:13.840 --> 04:18.440\nor well it wasn't specific. And so yeah, I don't know. And then I remembered my roommate\n\n04:18.440 --> 04:23.040\nwas like oh yeah. The last time I got surgery, they said you woke up and we're crying out\n\n04:23.040 --> 04:27.680\nin pain, but she didn't remember it and I'm like I don't. I guess it's a little better\n\n04:27.680 --> 04:32.480\nto not remember it, but it still seems terrible to go through. What are you getting surgered?\n\n04:32.480 --> 04:37.160\nWhat am I getting surgered? My hip, my left hip, which is great because lately my right\n\n04:37.160 --> 04:42.680\nhip has been hurting. So yeah, what is it? Is it bone shearing kind of stuff or what's\n\n04:42.680 --> 04:50.280\ngoing on? I got let's see femoral acid tabular impingement, which means you know the I've\n\n04:50.280 --> 04:54.440\nit's a great story. I've told it a lot of times that you know that hip is a ball and\n\n04:54.440 --> 05:01.320\nsocket joint Jeff and the ball is not shaped right. It's got too much ball going on and\n\n05:01.320 --> 05:04.720\nso they're going to get rid of some of the ball and then hopefully it's not going to\n\n05:04.720 --> 05:08.880\npop out. Well pop out is too violent. It kind of it kind of gets strained. You know like\n\n05:08.880 --> 05:12.960\nwhen you have an action figure and you kind of pull his arm too much back and it comes\n\n05:12.960 --> 05:17.720\na little bit out of the joint, but it's not popped out. That happens and when that happens,\n\n05:17.720 --> 05:23.280\nit grinds the soft tissues, not unlike a meat grinder slamming your door into a car into\n\n05:23.280 --> 05:27.800\na slamming your hand into a door. What causes identical to what Cody? Yeah, she has it on\n\n05:27.800 --> 05:31.640\nthe other end, right? The she has the socket rather than the ball, right? Something like\n\n05:31.640 --> 05:37.040\nthat. Yeah, something's misshapen. So the mortar and the pestle are just grinding cartilage.\n\n05:37.040 --> 05:41.840\nYeah. So she tried. I know it's fucked up, but we're all dying. Yeah. But it's better\n\n05:41.840 --> 05:46.200\nthat we just fucking deal with it. It actually uplifts us like allegedly like we're melting.\n\n05:46.200 --> 05:49.760\nWe're dying. You know what you got to get? You got to get that CBD. Yeah.\n\n05:49.760 --> 05:59.680\nTonight's episode is brought to you by Charlotte's Web CBD oils. Just throw a little CBD on\n\n05:59.680 --> 06:04.520\nthat. We can't tell you why because it's not legal to do so, but do it. What are they\n\n06:04.520 --> 06:08.560\ncutting open? They're going to my understanding is they're going to they're going to make\n\n06:08.560 --> 06:14.480\na slight incision on the hip pump the opening full of saline such to separate the muscle\n\n06:14.480 --> 06:21.120\nfibers without slicing them apart and then going through the gaps, not unlike a submarine\n\n06:21.120 --> 06:27.480\ntraversing the barrier reef. Is that something submarines reverse? They'll get in there.\n\n06:27.480 --> 06:31.000\nThey'll grind down. They'll suck out the bones. They'll take all the shredded suck\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:39.120\nout the bones. I'm not. I'm now. I hate the bones. Suck out the bones. I like Henry Jones\n\n06:39.120 --> 06:42.920\nbecause Henry Jones don't eat no meat. Don't suck out the bones. Don't suck out the bones.\n\n06:42.920 --> 06:47.720\nDon't suck. That's you taking a Hippocratic oath to not suck out bone. You suck them out\n\n06:47.720 --> 06:50.760\nlike like like they're actually like going to jack them out. Well, they're going to\n\n06:50.760 --> 06:54.600\nget a Dremel in there. They're going to grind away at the bones and then that'll that'll\n\n06:54.600 --> 06:58.680\nleave not sawdust, but bone dust. If you're if you're in a Tony Romo's if you're in a\n\n06:58.680 --> 07:03.400\nTony Romo's rib joint, suck out the bones. You're a doctor. Suck on the bone. Suck.\n\n07:03.400 --> 07:08.480\nSuck out the marrow. You can suck out the bones. You can suck out the bones. But if\n\n07:08.480 --> 07:13.320\nyou cook the rib for long enough, you could suck the bones right out. So your socket,\n\n07:13.320 --> 07:19.280\nyour socket is what my socket's great. My ball is too big. It's oval. It's interesting\n\n07:19.280 --> 07:23.960\nto me that there's a distinct that they draw a distinction because my fiance apparently\n\n07:23.960 --> 07:28.640\nhas the opposite, but it sounds identical, right? Because if the ball and socket aren't\n\n07:28.640 --> 07:35.200\nworking together, how do you know which is to blame? Well, x-rays. You could just see.\n\n07:35.200 --> 07:39.160\nBut you could you could fix the problem by changing either, right? They're either working\n\n07:39.160 --> 07:43.800\ntogether or they're not. Yeah, but I mean, it's yeah, you could probably,\n\n07:43.800 --> 07:47.960\nbut you'd be, you know, there's extra bone somewhere. So you want to take out the extra\n\n07:47.960 --> 07:52.160\nbone. You could take out the normal bone to make way for the extra bone, but that's probably\n\n07:52.160 --> 07:57.360\ndegrading the structural integrity of the bone. I'm sure it is. There's an ideal. Yeah. What\n\n07:57.360 --> 08:02.240\nam I doing? I want these people to go to eight years of school. Right. I don't want to know\n\n08:02.240 --> 08:05.360\nmore than them. Are you going to live in that world?\n\n08:05.360 --> 08:11.960\nGeneral anesthesia for this? Yeah, I'm hoping to die. It's weird because they always say\n\n08:11.960 --> 08:15.760\nthere's like a chance if you go under, you won't come up. But like, if there is that\n\n08:15.760 --> 08:19.760\ngood of a chance, I don't think they do that. You know, I said, and I asked you, you've\n\n08:19.760 --> 08:25.440\nbeen under before. Yeah, my wisdom teeth. I got a butt thing. How many how many people\n\n08:25.440 --> 08:29.600\nhere? Let's put it. Let's put a pin in your but thing. Right? That's what they did. Have\n\n08:29.600 --> 08:35.440\nbeen absolutely under for a medical procedure. Okay, that's good that you're all alive.\n\n08:35.440 --> 08:41.080\nHuh? The whole whole entire fucking audience. Yeah, it's I think wisdom teeth is a pretty\n\n08:41.080 --> 08:45.920\ncommon one. You generally go on. I don't want to high road you guys. You definitely go under,\n\n08:45.920 --> 08:51.040\nbut I've had scoppies. I don't know if your tooth procedures count. I think that's what\n\n08:51.040 --> 08:57.880\nno, but but I the thing I haven't gone through a couple of scoppies like endo. That's what\n\n08:57.880 --> 09:04.200\nI'm getting. And I had like a they put a slit. They did a biopsy thing. They had to get some\n\n09:04.200 --> 09:11.120\nshit out of there. So twice now I've been put under. Right. And I've come to realize\n\n09:11.120 --> 09:16.960\nthat because I remember and I've talked about this on a show before, but the first time\n\n09:16.960 --> 09:21.000\nis the anesthesial just came to me and said, do you have any questions? And I said, will\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:25.160\nI dream? And she said, nope. Nope. And it was such a fast answer. And I was like, what\n\n09:25.160 --> 09:29.720\nthe fuck is with the fast answer? Like, like, they know that subjective shouldn't shouldn't\n\n09:29.720 --> 09:34.280\nit be like, well, it depends on your religion. Well, I have some answers for that. There's\n\n09:34.280 --> 09:38.600\ndifferent kinds of sleep. And when I when I smoked a lot of weed, I stopped dreaming.\n\n09:38.600 --> 09:43.360\nAnd apparently when there's drugs like like the what do you call it? What's the night\n\n09:43.360 --> 09:48.600\nthe sleeping drug that everyone takes CBD bro? No, not melatonin. It's like the butterfly\n\n09:48.600 --> 09:55.760\nNetflix lunesta. Let's say yeah Netflix. It's one of those that's where you have a potato\n\n09:55.760 --> 10:06.640\nchip and poop. Oh, no, that's a lester. Oh, okay. It's just become the dad hour. But\n\n10:06.640 --> 10:10.360\nthere's those drugs that put you to sleep. They help you sleep in whatever. And those\n\n10:10.360 --> 10:14.320\napparently aren't good because they put you do bad sleep and you don't get rest out of\n\n10:14.320 --> 10:17.960\nit. You kind of need to go into deep sleep and then go into REM sleep to actually repair\n\n10:17.960 --> 10:22.560\nyour brain or remove brain plaques or whatever good sleep is doing for you. But when you're\n\n10:22.560 --> 10:25.880\ntaking drugs that make you not dream and stuff, it doesn't give you that kind of sleep. It's\n\n10:25.880 --> 10:29.680\na different kind of sleep. You're just like unconscious or whatever. And it's not that's\n\n10:29.680 --> 10:33.600\nnot good. You want to have good sleep. So it's they are inducing that kind of sleep.\n\n10:33.600 --> 10:36.920\nThey're inducing good sleep. They're inducing bad sleep. So you're not dreaming. And that's\n\n10:36.920 --> 10:44.800\nwhy they have such a firm answer. Okay. Well, okay. Well, so, but the good sleep, bad sleep.\n\n10:44.800 --> 10:49.320\nI mean, good sleep is because you're still alive. Bad sleep is you're the equivalent\n\n10:49.320 --> 10:54.240\nof dead. Like, like, like that was very comforting to me the second time I did a procedure where\n\n10:54.240 --> 10:59.360\nthey put me under. And then I came back and I was like, what the fuck? What in the why\n\n10:59.360 --> 11:04.520\nam I dressed like this? Oh, they cut you up. And I think and then I'm like driving home.\n\n11:04.520 --> 11:07.640\nI'm like, can't wait to get a drink. Can't wait to get back. You're not supposed to drive\n\n11:07.640 --> 11:10.480\nyourself home after that, by the way. Yeah, somebody else is supposed to drive. That's\n\n11:10.480 --> 11:14.720\nlike the rule. I'm like in the Uber and I'm like, take me to the drawing room and the\n\n11:14.720 --> 11:19.280\nguys like you're not supposed to drink after I'm like, take me before my fuck before this\n\n11:19.280 --> 11:26.280\nfades away. I want to combine it with everything on the top shelf. And part of it is because\n\n11:26.280 --> 11:38.640\nit's like there is to me, I do feel like I feared death 10 to 30% more before I had had\n\n11:38.640 --> 11:43.640\nthese experiences where they go, we're going to do this thing, we got to work on your throat\n\n11:43.640 --> 11:47.040\nand we don't want you to sue us. So we're going to put you in a state where you're never\n\n11:47.040 --> 11:51.960\ngoing to sue us. Right. And the state where you're never going to sue anybody is kind\n\n11:51.960 --> 11:58.480\nof death. They figured out how to put you in a state that just makes you not exist.\n\n11:58.480 --> 12:03.000\nIt doesn't make you dream. It doesn't make anything that your fiancee would say to you,\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:08.920\nmake you go like, yeah, but they don't want that during surgery. So you're being put by\n\n12:08.920 --> 12:14.880\ncorporate America into a state called death. And then they're bringing you back out of\n\n12:14.880 --> 12:20.680\ndeath. So while that's not necessarily a good power for them to have, it is like, it is\n\n12:20.680 --> 12:26.260\ncomforting for me when I think about it ago, like, yeah, oh God, what if, what if God doesn't\n\n12:26.260 --> 12:30.720\nexist? I'm like, motherfucker, you know what happens if God doesn't exist. It's called,\n\n12:30.720 --> 12:38.280\nit's called everything that led up to that surgery minus all the shit that happened after.\n\n12:38.280 --> 12:43.440\nThat's it. That ain't so bad. Right. That's what I'm afraid of, though. That that to me,\n\n12:43.440 --> 12:47.360\nthat is so bad. You know what I found? It's so bad in a philosophical sense. Well, you've\n\n12:47.360 --> 12:52.360\ndone a lot. You've done a lot. I'm just like, it's not, it's not Vietnam. It's like, it's\n\n12:52.360 --> 12:57.360\nnot like, well, it's like, whatever happens before you go into that state, it's like,\n\n12:57.360 --> 13:02.760\nah, Tommy, I can't feel my legs. No, it's all right. Remember the Bronx pizza? Oh, shit,\n\n13:02.760 --> 13:08.040\nput my intestines. Like that's all life. That's life. That's not death. There's nothing to\n\n13:08.040 --> 13:13.960\nfear about death. The story of like, of like a famous, like his famous, like a hiker who\n\n13:13.960 --> 13:17.800\nwrote this thing. And he would, he would go in these giant, like, like mountain hiking\n\n13:17.800 --> 13:22.400\ntrips, and he would bring one long novel to read. And every page he read, he would tear\n\n13:22.400 --> 13:27.080\nthe page off to lighten the weight of what he, you know, like what he's carrying as he\n\n13:27.080 --> 13:30.720\ngoes along. So he's reading his book. And he's like, why, why have the rest of the pages\n\n13:30.720 --> 13:34.160\nbehind you that you're not going to read again? Like, you just see, we just tear the pages\n\n13:34.160 --> 13:36.080\nand throw them away as he was he hiked along.\n\n13:36.080 --> 13:38.640\nBecause he's like the last shit I'm ever going to read. I don't give a shit.\n\n13:38.640 --> 13:42.560\nYeah, it's like, I'd rather carry a light book and like, like everything before me is\n\n13:42.560 --> 13:45.800\nthe first page of the book that I'm reading and everything else has already happened.\n\n13:45.800 --> 13:50.240\nAnd did anyone, I mean, everyone right now is going like, what the, how in the fuck are\n\n13:50.240 --> 13:57.480\nyou littering at this time? Like, just because you're there and there's like no cops, you're\n\n13:57.480 --> 14:02.120\njust like fucking, like I, yeah, I bring a bag of French fries. I do the same thing.\n\n14:02.120 --> 14:05.400\nI like throw a fucking McNugget wrapper.\n\n14:05.400 --> 14:14.040\nHe is papers by her degradable. I just think the one one man's poet is another man's\n\n14:14.040 --> 14:18.880\nhead. I mean, look, the first thing I thought to is like litterbug. What are you doing?\n\n14:18.880 --> 14:23.320\nLike, like, like, do you want to like, what if other people 20 years from now want to\n\n14:23.320 --> 14:26.800\nbe the guy that's never been here before? And they're like, what is this shit? There's\n\n14:26.800 --> 14:32.520\na hustler pages everywhere. That's a pictorial about a waitress being in a guy's mouth.\n\n14:32.520 --> 14:38.560\nWhy did he take, eat, love, pray? Bring something fucking heavy.\n\n14:38.560 --> 14:44.520\nSkinny legs and all. Tim Robbins just wishes he was Kurt Vonnegut. Tom Robbins, sorry.\n\n14:44.520 --> 14:48.120\nYou know what scared me? That didn't scare me. It kind of alarmed me after the fact when\n\n14:48.120 --> 14:53.640\nI had my vocal surgery. It was, I was under, I was up at like an hour and a half later.\n\n14:53.640 --> 14:58.400\nEverything was fine. Everything was groovy. They told me I was in a wheelchair so that\n\n14:58.400 --> 15:02.680\nlike church could drive me home. I had to be come out in a wheelchair. I was, I stood\n\n15:02.680 --> 15:06.800\nup. I was fine. Like, you good to walk? I'm like, yeah, I'm fine. And I didn't realize\n\n15:06.800 --> 15:13.520\nthat they had drawn and with a sharpie, an X on the side of my neck. I'm like, what is\n\n15:13.520 --> 15:17.000\nthat about? And they go, Oh, that was just to make sure the doctors know what side to\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:21.960\ncut into right because otherwise they're so good at their job that they'll just fuck\n\n15:21.960 --> 15:27.080\nright up. We trust them to kill us and bring us back to life, but they don't know what\n\n15:27.080 --> 15:31.120\nside to be putting a, they're going to be putting a camera and a laser beam down my\n\n15:31.120 --> 15:34.800\nthroat and they want to make sure that laser beaming the right side of my neck. But it\n\n15:34.800 --> 15:39.080\nwas just a good old fashioned X marks the spot on the outsides. They goes, Oh, we're\n\n15:39.080 --> 15:43.640\ndoing left side today. That's that's like, that's like, that's a little too analog for\n\n15:43.640 --> 15:47.200\nmy fucking ball. I'll, I'll, I've said it before I'll say it again.\n\n15:47.200 --> 15:52.520\nAnd the socket doctors are serial killers with support systems. That's their privileged\n\n15:52.520 --> 16:01.400\nserial killers. I like a Jeffrey Dahmer might have been a head chief of staff, but he grew\n\n16:01.400 --> 16:08.760\nup in Milwaukee. God bless him. He was just trying to make AI. Speaking of which podcast\n\n16:08.760 --> 16:14.160\nI read it. Yeah. I asked somebody I was I was in Milwaukee like four or five days ago\n\n16:14.160 --> 16:17.400\nand I asked somebody like, you guys have the most serial killers. They go, no, that's Washington.\n\n16:17.400 --> 16:21.360\nI'm like, they're proud of that. That's like a weird Australia. Like you guys have so many\n\n16:21.360 --> 16:25.800\npoison spiders. So like 30% of our spiders aren't poisonous. Like no one's supposed to\n\n16:25.800 --> 16:31.000\nknow that you're not supposed to have that reaction. All right. Anyways, let's let's\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:37.400\nlet's get to our guest. We can talk to him about all this and more. I've I've I've it's\n\n16:37.400 --> 16:41.320\na complicated relationship because I'm like, I'm like in this new age of like everyone's\n\n16:41.320 --> 16:46.520\nI can touch people. I can, I can hurt them. I can judge them. I can like it's that I can\n\n16:46.520 --> 16:51.280\nbe a fan. I can like whatever. I don't know. And I'm in the true crime podcast. We we flew\n\n16:51.280 --> 16:57.880\nthe red handed ladies out from from from London. And we're it was a blessing. And we've had\n\n16:57.880 --> 17:02.440\na good time. And then I'm like, like in the I don't know, I talk about the shit I listened\n\n17:02.440 --> 17:06.840\nto on podcasts. And I'm like, Oh, I've been talking about this guy, Asperger detective.\n\n17:06.840 --> 17:10.400\nAnd then I'm like, you heard me go through in this podcast where I'm like, well, I probably\n\n17:10.400 --> 17:15.480\nshouldn't call him that. That's got that seems like bullying. Because if you like like the\n\n17:15.480 --> 17:21.520\nguy in the meantime, we've become fans and all this stuff like this. Anyways, he's here.\n\n17:21.520 --> 17:31.560\nAnd he's amazing. Please welcome Ryan Krauss from from Cold Case mystery murders.\n\n17:31.560 --> 17:45.960\nI didn't even get that right.

I definitely\n\n17:49.280 --> 17:55.680\nnobody expected you to look like Michael chick list. That's not. And that's the biggest compliment\n\n17:55.680 --> 17:59.760\nin the world. I told you last night we had dinner. I'm like, like, Michael chick list\n\n17:59.760 --> 18:06.320\nis everyone's catch offer. You shave your head and work out. I would have said he looks\n\n18:06.320 --> 18:13.760\nmore like that one judge that you really want to impress on a cooking show. Anyway, it's\n\n18:13.760 --> 18:16.760\nrude to bring you out. I think your favorite profile is here, but you got to use a little\n\n18:16.760 --> 18:20.920\nmore salt in this, man. You got to. Anyway, sorry, how are you? How was your trip? Thank\n\n18:20.920 --> 18:28.240\nyou for driving out here. Oh, I'm great. Yeah. Yeah, you drove here from Phoenix. Yeah.\n\n18:28.240 --> 18:31.400\nYeah, unfortunately. Yeah, you're going to you're going to have to eat that Mike. We\n\n18:31.400 --> 18:35.920\nhave to tell everyone. Yeah, it's the worst like this. I'm so close. You're going to\n\n18:35.920 --> 18:40.000\nbe this close. Okay. Otherwise, people will be like, I hated him. In my mouth. I hate\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:44.200\nyou. No more far away guess. Why was that guy so far away? And we're like, he wasn't\n\n18:44.200 --> 18:48.760\nfar away. You're a Phoenix native for residents. No, I just moved away from LA actually about\n\n18:48.760 --> 18:54.400\nsix months ago, unfortunately. But so you fled LA and you've moved to Arizona. Yeah,\n\n18:54.400 --> 18:58.920\nI was like, I had a corporate job and the podcast and I could only really keep one. So I had\n\n18:58.920 --> 19:03.480\nto let something go and I was in Santa Monica. So I let go of the corporate job. And yeah,\n\n19:03.480 --> 19:10.520\nI just had to do my thing. I do love I love those stories like when you get into true\n\n19:10.520 --> 19:15.600\ncrime podcasts, you're like invested in people that have a certain amount of Patreon subscribers\n\n19:15.600 --> 19:22.800\nand then hopefully usually there's like a moment where they're like, guys, if enough\n\n19:22.800 --> 19:27.200\nof you help me, I can actually stop delivering pizza or whatever. And you kind of like you\n\n19:27.200 --> 19:31.720\nexperience this sort of like you get to watch a million Stan Lee's like create a million\n\n19:31.720 --> 19:37.400\nSpider-Man's kind of, but it's like it's a healthy in a healthy level. So I and I heard\n\n19:37.400 --> 19:41.680\nthat episode where you're like, you're telling your origin story of working in cubicles\n\n19:41.680 --> 19:47.400\nand stuff. And it was it was pretty, pretty deep and electric. It's really I is more than\n\n19:47.400 --> 19:51.520\nI expected. Yeah, I don't even know if I remember that there's an underlying thing to you. We\n\n19:51.520 --> 19:56.360\nshould talk about this later though, because we should like where you you you kind of God\n\n19:56.360 --> 20:03.880\ndinner or I mean great. Thank you, Steve. I just don't understand why it can't happen\n\n20:03.880 --> 20:10.960\nearlier. I'll tell you why because I didn't text him yet. Oh, you texted. I had to say\n\n20:10.960 --> 20:14.560\nhe keeps dropping the ball. He keeps dropping the ball day before your surgery and you're\n\n20:14.560 --> 20:18.440\nin charge of ice. Well, I got to be in charge of ice going forward. It's going to be a big\n\n20:18.440 --> 20:28.760\npart of my life for a couple weeks. That's just true. Anyways, so let's talk. Let's talk.\n\n20:28.760 --> 20:34.960\nCan we talk about your origin story? Like you going from working stiff to true crime\n\n20:34.960 --> 20:40.200\npodcaster? Okay. Yeah, let's do that. Which part of we want to talk about? I don't know.\n\n20:40.200 --> 20:44.840\nLike give us the rough edges. You don't have to I heard an episode where you talk about\n\n20:44.840 --> 20:49.040\nit. There was like a there was like a whole thing. You don't have to talk. Is that the\n\n20:49.040 --> 20:54.440\nColumbine episode or was the one before it? I think that was a free episode. Yeah, could\n\n20:54.440 --> 20:59.720\nhave been but but but just give us the I don't know. Like you see you. Why are you interested\n\n20:59.720 --> 21:04.400\nin true crime? Why did you start a true crime podcast? That kind of thing. I got a bad interviewer\n\n21:04.400 --> 21:09.160\njust help me out in the true crime thing started way back in the day. I mean, my mom was watching\n\n21:09.160 --> 21:13.480\nunsolved mysteries all the time. I don't know if anybody's a fan of unsolved mysteries with\n\n21:13.480 --> 21:17.760\nher like constantly. So I was always just in the house and I would hear about true crime\n\n21:17.760 --> 21:21.760\nand he's unsolved things and I just started becoming interested in that. And I think for\n\n21:21.760 --> 21:26.040\nme it was like, Oh, how did these people's brains work? Why did these people kill being\n\n21:26.040 --> 21:30.160\nsociopaths like criminals? Yeah, I mean, it was I wanted to know about everybody's brain\n\n21:30.160 --> 21:34.960\nand why is this person a psychopath or a sociopath? Do you think what do you think is isolating\n\n21:34.960 --> 21:41.280\nthat like what is it fear? Like is it fascination when we want because I think it's linked to\n\n21:41.280 --> 21:47.800\nwhy we watch movies about mafia people, werewolves, like like we we have this fascination. Oh,\n\n21:47.800 --> 21:53.840\nthese people are sociopaths. Is it is it like I'm scared. Werewolves just get bit.\n\n21:53.840 --> 21:59.720\nIs it is it I'm scared I'm like them or is it I'm so scared of them I need to understand\n\n21:59.720 --> 22:04.120\nthem to like, I think it's both of those things. I mean, I think to a certain extent all of\n\n22:04.120 --> 22:10.200\nus have some type of sociopathic tendencies. And we noticed that in our behavior and sometimes\n\n22:10.200 --> 22:16.160\nwe're ashamed of it. We try to get away from it. But you know, I think there is some darkness\n\n22:16.160 --> 22:21.960\nin all of us, whether it ever comes out or not. And for me, that was the fascination\n\n22:21.960 --> 22:27.400\nwas just, you know, am I like this? Who is like this? Why are they like this? Why are\n\n22:27.400 --> 22:34.560\nthey more like this than me? Yeah, yeah, why is this person considering themselves like\n\n22:34.560 --> 22:40.960\na candidate for driving their children into a river and jumping out of the car and blaming\n\n22:40.960 --> 22:46.840\nit on a random minority? Like why did they just think that was okay to do? Which of them\n\n22:46.840 --> 22:51.000\ngot away with it? Why did they get away with it? What did they do when they were in police\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:55.720\ncustody? Like it extends to all of them. Yeah, when you watch the TV shows, like I'm you know,\n\n22:55.720 --> 23:01.560\nI watched the forensic files and the data lines and stuff like that. And they the cops\n\n23:01.560 --> 23:04.680\nfrequently go yeah, you know, they always think they're smarter than us. You know, this\n\n23:04.680 --> 23:09.640\nguy thought he knew all the angles. But like, I wonder how many people that are really smart\n\n23:09.640 --> 23:14.600\nactually do know all the angles and get away with it. It's like, they kind of are smarter\n\n23:14.600 --> 23:20.760\nthan you, a lot of them, because you guys do it every day. And we were talking about this\n\n23:20.760 --> 23:25.080\nat dinner last night, I like, like, like, I don't know what the percentage is. But I\n\n23:25.080 --> 23:30.080\nthink the difficult thing for cops who I am, I am my fan of true crime is like making me\n\n23:30.080 --> 23:33.960\na big fan of homicide detectives, because Jesus Christ, if you think working at Kinko's\n\n23:33.960 --> 23:38.040\nis hard, like, it's like, like, like, like this, this like idea that they have to work\n\n23:38.040 --> 23:42.320\nwith these people and they have to get confessions out of them. And then half of the time, if\n\n23:42.320 --> 23:46.840\nthey successfully get a confession, it's like, you asked why he's not guilty. And they're\n\n23:46.840 --> 23:55.240\nlike, but I only did what I like. So most of the time they're lying. And but they, they\n\n23:55.240 --> 24:01.040\nlike, it's like a lot of times like you, you watch like forensic files and the cops will\n\n24:01.040 --> 24:06.360\ntalk about their techniques and they'll go, they'll, they'll leverage the fact that the\n\n24:06.360 --> 24:13.320\naverage person given an average person that commits a murder, like that they'll, they'll\n\n24:13.320 --> 24:16.920\nbe leveraged by the idea that the cop wants to be their friend, for instance.\n\n24:16.920 --> 24:17.920\nOh, yeah, definitely.\n\n24:17.920 --> 24:22.680\nThat they'll be like, Oh, don't you seem like a smart guy? And the person will respond and\n\n24:22.680 --> 24:25.920\nthey'll do the saying like, I don't think you want to be dishonest. Like I think you\n\n24:25.920 --> 24:29.960\nwant to do right by the mother of the victim and stuff. And it's like that that impulse\n\n24:29.960 --> 24:31.960\nto like not let the cop down.\n\n24:31.960 --> 24:35.920\nYeah, they're seeking validation. And the cops know that. Yeah, they tend to just feed\n\n24:35.920 --> 24:39.640\nright into that. And the cops, whatever they see, that is, whatever they see is lacking\n\n24:39.640 --> 24:44.480\nwithin that person, whatever the desperation is that cause them to commit the crimes. That's\n\n24:44.480 --> 24:46.000\ngenerally what they go after.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:51.760\nThat's just what an abuser does is notice, notice what the person what pushes the person's\n\n24:51.760 --> 24:54.240\nright. It tries to feed into that to manipulate them.\n\n24:54.240 --> 24:59.040\nBut you're kind of an abuser abuser when you're right, when you when you suspect that a person\n\n24:59.040 --> 25:02.840\nis yeah, and it's like that's the thing is like, I don't know what I haven't heard cops\n\n25:02.840 --> 25:07.240\ntalk a lot about on these true crime shows. The ones that I love because they have cops\n\n25:07.240 --> 25:12.600\ninvolved like they don't. It's like there aren't any rules when you're dealing with sociopaths.\n\n25:12.600 --> 25:18.220\nI like your show because you talk a lot about your you talk about sociopaths in what seems\n\n25:18.220 --> 25:23.080\nto me to be the right way. Because it's like, I don't want to praise them. I don't think\n\n25:23.080 --> 25:27.280\nthey're better than us. At the same time, I don't think I don't think we should pretend\n\n25:27.280 --> 25:32.960\nthat they're like they don't exist. But like, I like that you're kind of like you're always\n\n25:32.960 --> 25:38.720\nlike, this guy's a fucking idiot. That's the thing is he thinks he can just he's such\n\n25:38.720 --> 25:44.720\na sociopath. He's going to call 911 and just make up a murder story. And here's the thing,\n\n25:44.720 --> 25:49.440\nyou can't do that. That's really hard for people that make them up for a living to do\n\n25:49.440 --> 25:55.000\nas much anything on television. It doesn't work. Like the people that are great at that\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:58.920\nthe people that are great at making the perfect fake 911 call or whatever, they end up being\n\n25:58.920 --> 26:03.000\nso proud of themselves that they can't wait to tell everybody that they hang out with.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:09.080\nMan, I fucking told I called 911. It is true. They're so proud of themselves about it.\n\n26:09.080 --> 26:14.520\nWhat is it? Can you tell me the difference between a sociopath and a psychopath?\n\n26:14.520 --> 26:20.000\nYou know, I've actually made up my own rules about that because I love to hear it. Yeah.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:24.960\nAs far as a sociopath goes, well, psychopath, first of all, psychopath, we think of as a\n\n26:24.960 --> 26:30.080\npuppet master. So they're generally people who use their resources as a puppet master\n\n26:30.080 --> 26:34.640\nover something or somebody else in that manner. So we think of like there were the case of\n\n26:34.640 --> 26:38.800\nMichelle Carter and I don't know if anybody's familiar with that. She was the one who had\n\n26:38.800 --> 26:43.760\nthe boyfriend who committed suicide or her urging. She sent him hundreds of texts saying\n\n26:43.760 --> 26:48.600\nkill yourself now, do it now, do it now because she had that emotional power over him. John\n\n26:48.600 --> 26:54.400\nWayne Gacy, somebody like that, another classic psychopath. He's a guy who was offering jobs\n\n26:54.400 --> 26:58.800\nthat paid much more than anybody else would pay for labor. So he was able to get young\n\n26:58.800 --> 27:02.600\nmen to do things they wouldn't normally do. And they took a lot of risks and they would\n\n27:02.600 --> 27:06.880\nstick around his home because if they didn't, they couldn't make that money. And so he\n\n27:06.880 --> 27:11.000\nwas more of a puppet master like that. But with the sociopath, I generally think of them\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:15.560\nmore as leeches. And so what they're doing is they're manipulating you for your resources\n\n27:15.560 --> 27:21.440\nrather than using theirs to control you. They're generally lazier. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, they're\n\n27:21.440 --> 27:28.640\nconsidered fringe characters. Sociopaths settle. Sometimes they take the spotlight because\n\n27:28.640 --> 27:34.080\nof where they landed. Who would have expected a sociopath to become CEO of this company?\n\n27:34.080 --> 27:38.760\nAnd then it's like, whoa, this sociopath is the star of this show, but it's only really\n\n27:38.760 --> 27:44.400\nbecause of the situation they landed in. Combined with the fact that a sociopath is like a jellyfish.\n\n27:44.400 --> 27:50.000\nThey're like, I'll do whatever I can to survive. I have no fucking empathy. And a psychopath\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:55.800\nhas a little bit of an itch. It's like, I'm playing Grand Theft Auto and it's pretty boring.\n\n27:55.800 --> 28:01.120\nLike, what do I got to do to make this interesting? They want, they have a little bit of the-\n\n28:01.120 --> 28:06.400\nAre there psychopaths that actually just like gamblers will take terrible risks to make\n\n28:06.400 --> 28:11.920\nstupid bets because they get a kick out of the action? They call it, right? Are there\n\n28:11.920 --> 28:16.880\npsychopathic murderers and criminals? I'm sure there are. That do it simply for that\n\n28:16.880 --> 28:24.280\nkind of adrenaline thing? Or is it the simple idea that they feel that they're allowed to\n\n28:24.280 --> 28:29.040\nbecause they have that status? Yeah, I mean, the psychopath is generally\n\n28:29.040 --> 28:32.800\njust known for having no regard for anybody else. And so that's why they're sometimes\n\n28:32.800 --> 28:40.520\ngood corporate CEOs and things of that nature. I read that they're more comfortable drifting\n\n28:40.520 --> 28:46.720\nthat a psychopath is like a coconut. They contain everything they need. Like, a psychopath\n\n28:46.720 --> 28:52.520\ncould go years just wandering around. And a sociopath actually gets anxious about like,\n\n28:52.520 --> 28:58.120\nI don't know, I feel like I don't even have a family. Like, even though they don't actually\n\n28:58.120 --> 29:04.400\nempathize with, but they feel anxiety about uprooting and wandering. And a psychopath\n\n29:04.400 --> 29:09.560\nis like, actually, the open roads, the only place to be. That's one thing that I read.\n\n29:09.560 --> 29:15.520\nAre there other classifications beyond psychopath and sociopath for the people that you like\n\n29:15.520 --> 29:19.480\nprofile on your show? Yeah, I mean, there are plenty of subcategories\n\n29:19.480 --> 29:23.960\nand things of that nature. But I mean, those are generally the two major classifications.\n\n29:23.960 --> 29:31.520\nWhat kind of, if you murder someone for any reason other than food, or them trying to\n\n29:31.520 --> 29:36.640\nmake you food. You might be a redneck. I mean, if you murder\n\n29:36.640 --> 29:43.040\nsomeone, are you automatically a sociopath? Can you be like retro diagnosed as a sociopath?\n\n29:43.040 --> 29:47.240\nNo, not necessarily. I mean, you could just be somebody who flipped out at any moment\n\n29:47.240 --> 29:52.800\nand killed someone. It could be an anger issue. For sociopaths, generally what I believe they've\n\n29:52.800 --> 29:57.720\nbeen created to do, I believe that their brains have been created specifically to not allow\n\n29:57.720 --> 30:03.440\nthem to make adjustments in their narrative as far as what they do on a daily basis.\n\n30:03.440 --> 30:08.000\nSo a lot of detectives will tell you that when you're dealing with a sociopath, generally\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:13.400\nwhat happens is they have a very rigid logic. And so they follow that logic and they don't\n\n30:13.400 --> 30:15.080\nveer from it at all. The detectives.\n\n30:15.080 --> 30:19.600\nWell, no, the sociopath. That's, I knew that.\n\n30:19.600 --> 30:24.920\nBy not veering from the logic, they will continue to make mistakes again and again and again\n\n30:24.920 --> 30:25.920\nup until.\n\n30:25.920 --> 30:30.120\nBecause they've written a story in their mind that can't be like deviated from.\n\n30:30.120 --> 30:35.440\nYeah. And there's a lot of denial involved. And the reason the denial is involved is because,\n\n30:35.440 --> 30:38.880\nlike you're saying, they can't deviate from the original plan. And so they will just follow\n\n30:38.880 --> 30:43.360\nthrough even if the logic doesn't make sense. And the idea is the brain has been developed\n\n30:43.360 --> 30:47.560\nlike that specifically to put them in prison. But in the process, we're creating a lot of\n\n30:47.560 --> 30:50.320\ntechnology related to detecting light.\n\n30:50.320 --> 30:54.760\nRight. They've been placed by God as like debugging equipment.\n\n30:54.760 --> 30:55.760\nOh, absolutely. Yeah.\n\n30:55.760 --> 31:01.680\nThat their job is to go through the highway map and constantly try to turn right.\n\n31:01.680 --> 31:02.680\nYes.\n\n31:02.680 --> 31:07.080\nAnd if they're able to, it either represents a place where you need an on-ramp as in Lizzie\n\n31:07.080 --> 31:08.080\nBorden, possibly.\n\n31:08.080 --> 31:09.080\nYeah, right.\n\n31:09.080 --> 31:13.440\nLike you did a Lizzie Borden episode where your take on it was very, you're like, I mean,\n\n31:13.440 --> 31:18.840\nI don't mean to put words in your mouth, but my brutish summation of your take on Lizzie\n\n31:18.840 --> 31:25.440\nBorden was basically like, this is a woman who if she was being denied the things that\n\n31:25.440 --> 31:33.200\nshe felt she deserved in like 40 years difference, like there wouldn't be as much question about\n\n31:33.200 --> 31:38.800\nwhat she was entitled to. This was a woman who was being told at her place in time that\n\n31:38.800 --> 31:44.480\nthere's no, you're in a cell socially, like, oh, you're a spinster. You either need to\n\n31:44.480 --> 31:48.800\nmarry a man and submit to his will, or you need to do what your father says. And she\n\n31:48.800 --> 31:54.600\nwas like, psych, I have a hack for that. No pun intended.\n\n31:54.600 --> 31:56.600\nI have 30.\n\n31:56.600 --> 31:58.600\nWhich is short for hatchet.\n\n31:58.600 --> 31:59.600\nYes, exactly.\n\n31:59.600 --> 32:03.400\nAnd I mean, did I paraphrase you wrong?\n\n32:03.400 --> 32:04.400\nNo, that's great.\n\n32:04.400 --> 32:06.280\nI mean, that's a great example of that as well.\n\n32:06.280 --> 32:09.520\nNot that these people are gods or monsters or heroes or villains, but that sometimes\n\n32:09.520 --> 32:14.400\ntheir functionality is a scrubbing bubble, that they're like going like, hey, there's\n\n32:14.400 --> 32:19.320\na fucking, like there's railings here that like a woman isn't allowed to do anything\n\n32:19.320 --> 32:22.720\nexcept chop a mother fucker.\n\n32:22.720 --> 32:30.040\nAnd we do, we do that. We do that with, that's why our history is like such a roller coaster\n\n32:30.040 --> 32:35.120\nof like criminals that become like exonerated things, like sometimes the sociopaths are\n\n32:35.120 --> 32:39.760\nlike, it's like, oh, they're not a role model. However, if it weren't for them, blibbity\n\n32:39.760 --> 32:40.760\nblue blue.\n\n32:40.760 --> 32:44.760\nYeah, yeah. I mean, there's a, there's a thing that makes a sociopath special is that\n\n32:44.760 --> 32:45.760\nlike, for instance,\n\n32:45.760 --> 32:46.760\nIs it?\n\n32:46.760 --> 32:47.760\nHe's writing it down.\n\n32:47.760 --> 32:48.760\nHow do you spell blibbity blue?\n\n32:48.760 --> 32:49.760\nB-L-I-V-E-E-E.\n\n32:49.760 --> 32:50.760\nIt's two-piece, two-piece.\n\n32:50.760 --> 32:51.760\nYeah.\n\n32:51.760 --> 32:52.760\nSorry, I go ahead.\n\n32:52.760 --> 32:58.920\nI'm sorry. And I'm sorry I'm a bad interviewer and I'm sorry for everything.\n\n32:58.920 --> 32:59.920\nBut Lizzie Borden.\n\n32:59.920 --> 33:00.920\nI don't even remember what I was going to say.\n\n33:00.920 --> 33:05.560\nShe was a, she was like, what, 19, something like early in the past and she was in a big\n\n33:05.560 --> 33:09.520\nhouse and she killed her dad to get the house and she got away with it more or less is the\n\n33:09.520 --> 33:10.520\ntheory.\n\n33:10.520 --> 33:11.520\nYeah, she killed her mom too.\n\n33:11.520 --> 33:16.120\nBecause, right, because, because like, she just was like, ah, I was painting and I got\n\n33:16.120 --> 33:21.160\nthese clothes red with paint and now I threw them out and it's not suspicious back then.\n\n33:21.160 --> 33:24.760\nAnd so like, she was just exploiting the legal system or the system.\n\n33:24.760 --> 33:28.200\nYeah, she just totally exploited the legal system. It's something that happens on a daily\n\n33:28.200 --> 33:33.560\nbasis now. And because of incidents like that, and we were able to create better forensics,\n\n33:33.560 --> 33:35.720\nwe now under have a better understanding of that.\n\n33:35.720 --> 33:39.960\nSo that's really the purpose of the sociopath is to advance that technology over and over\n\n33:39.960 --> 33:40.960\nand over.\n\n33:40.960 --> 33:45.440\nSo their faulty logic ensures when they want something and they can't get it, they'll engage\n\n33:45.440 --> 33:48.200\ncriminality because there's just no other way to get it.\n\n33:48.200 --> 33:52.680\nSo if you're Lizzie Borden, you're stuck in this house, you don't get your father's money.\n\n33:52.680 --> 33:56.200\nHe's healthy and he's not going to die for a long time.\n\n33:56.200 --> 34:00.320\nYou basically just do whatever you have to do to make sure he's dead without even worrying\n\n34:00.320 --> 34:01.320\nabout the logic.\n\n34:01.320 --> 34:03.840\nAnd that's generally how the sociopath works.\n\n34:03.840 --> 34:10.800\nSo you have this thing that you do that other podcasters don't do where you have a lot of\n\n34:10.800 --> 34:11.800\nthose.\n\n34:11.800 --> 34:14.200\nYou have, you do it fully nude.\n\n34:14.200 --> 34:15.200\nYes.\n\n34:15.200 --> 34:16.200\nYes.\n\n34:16.200 --> 34:22.200\nI actually requested to do this show nude and dad was like, I don't know, I don't know.\n\n34:22.200 --> 34:26.400\nBut you do, you kind of pick, I'm kind of curious about your process, but you can tell me, no,\n\n34:26.400 --> 34:27.400\nthat jumps the shark.\n\n34:27.400 --> 34:33.160\nI can't tell you exactly how I do it, but I'm curious about how you, like you pick a case\n\n34:33.160 --> 34:38.560\nbecause part of your gimmick is you pretty much always go lateral.\n\n34:38.560 --> 34:47.680\nI mean, you, you, you, the, for me as a consumer, the joy of true crime is that it's like, these\n\n34:47.680 --> 34:52.680\nare all different personalities, but the canon is all the same because it's true crime.\n\n34:52.680 --> 34:54.280\nEveryone's going to do JonBenét Ramsey.\n\n34:54.280 --> 35:00.080\nAnd I want them to, I, and it, because I want the same way that Shakespeare was just adapting\n\n35:00.080 --> 35:01.080\nwhatever.\n\n35:01.080 --> 35:03.040\nHarmon, shut up and just get to your point.\n\n35:03.040 --> 35:10.920\nMy point is that like your, your unique gimmick is that you, you actually do kind of investigate\n\n35:10.920 --> 35:11.920\nthese things.\n\n35:11.920 --> 35:21.040\nYou pick cases that have questionable resolutions and you, you very proudly put a crown on your\n\n35:21.040 --> 35:26.480\nhead and go like, look, here's the thing, I don't need any more information than I have.\n\n35:26.480 --> 35:30.040\nI don't know, a lot of people talk about, they wish this autopsy photo came back, but\n\n35:30.040 --> 35:31.040\nguess what?\n\n35:31.040 --> 35:33.000\nYou don't fucking need it.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:38.080\nAll you need, all you need to solve this case is to think about one thing, evolution.\n\n35:38.080 --> 35:43.320\nAnd you, and it's, it's either the, like Cody at my fiance and I were like, oh, it's\n\n35:43.320 --> 35:48.320\ngo like, we go, he goes, you always like, you go, like, it's going to be one thing.\n\n35:48.320 --> 35:54.120\nIt's either going to be evolution resources or redirection of light and, and I'm not mocking\n\n35:54.120 --> 36:00.560\nyou because it is, you go, you commit to that like a crazy kind of Colombo like, like, like\n\n36:00.560 --> 36:02.760\ndetective, like you're good at it.\n\n36:02.760 --> 36:03.760\nYou do it well.\n\n36:03.760 --> 36:05.240\nWhat is redirection of light?\n\n36:05.240 --> 36:06.240\nOh, yes.\n\n36:06.240 --> 36:07.240\nPlease explain this.\n\n36:07.240 --> 36:08.240\nIt is.\n\n36:08.240 --> 36:09.240\nThis is great.\n\n36:09.240 --> 36:11.760\nWell, we got, we got some, some light redirection things.\n\n36:11.760 --> 36:13.760\nSome ROL fans out there.\n\n36:13.760 --> 36:15.040\nThis is, this is, this is one of your big things.\n\n36:15.040 --> 36:18.600\nAnd for those who aren't indoctrinated, it's like, like, I mean, you're constantly talking\n\n36:18.600 --> 36:20.000\nabout redirection of light.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:21.000\nYeah.\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:25.400\nI mean, redirection of light can, that, it's actually, I mean, it's just essentially just\n\n36:25.400 --> 36:26.960\nblocking the truth in some way.\n\n36:26.960 --> 36:30.960\nIt can be thought of in many ways, but I think one of the ways that I explained it recently,\n\n36:30.960 --> 36:34.920\nI covered the Justin Ross Harris case, if everybody's familiar with that.\n\n36:34.920 --> 36:37.400\nHe was a hot car death with his young son.\n\n36:37.400 --> 36:38.400\nAnd he's in prison for it now.\n\n36:38.400 --> 36:44.160\nIs that the guy that left his kid in the car and then went to, yeah, he, he, he just,\n\n36:44.160 --> 36:47.960\nhe left his kid in the car when he went to work instead of taking the kid to daycare.\n\n36:47.960 --> 36:49.640\nAnd it was in Atlanta in June.\n\n36:49.640 --> 36:55.600\nAnd he claimed that he, his case was, I didn't know, I'm hearing in periods.\n\n36:55.600 --> 36:57.560\nI forgot my kid was in the car.\n\n36:57.560 --> 36:59.160\nI, I, I took him to work.\n\n36:59.160 --> 37:02.720\nI went to work and then we went to lunch and then my kid got cooked in a car.\n\n37:02.720 --> 37:03.720\nYeah.\n\n37:03.720 --> 37:07.840\nAnd he claimed, he had claimed that for seven hours, he didn't think of his son.\n\n37:07.840 --> 37:12.280\nAnd you could see by the way that he had parked his vehicle and the movements that he made\n\n37:12.280 --> 37:16.760\ncoming in and out of the building, that he was intentionally avoiding certain things and\n\n37:16.760 --> 37:19.600\nwas positioning his vehicle in certain ways.\n\n37:19.600 --> 37:23.960\nAnd the one of the, like I said, the sociopath is unable to see when, once he reaches the\n\n37:23.960 --> 37:28.760\nstage of denial, he's unable to see that he's not making adaptations to his plan.\n\n37:28.760 --> 37:33.520\nAnd so one of the instances of redirected light that I talked about was that he pulls\n\n37:33.520 --> 37:39.440\nthe vehicle into the parking space by backing in because he wants to be able to get out\n\n37:39.440 --> 37:42.500\nand not have to look into the back of the vehicle.\n\n37:42.500 --> 37:47.680\nSo if he pulls in forward, he has to get out and walk past the door where his son is in\n\n37:47.680 --> 37:49.600\nthe car seat and he would see him.\n\n37:49.600 --> 37:55.160\nSo he intentionally backs in, but by backing in what happens is he creates a situation\n\n37:55.160 --> 37:58.960\nwhere he would have seen the kid in the backseat through the side mirror.\n\n37:58.960 --> 37:59.960\nI'm sorry.\n\n37:59.960 --> 38:00.960\nI don't quite follow that.\n\n38:00.960 --> 38:05.080\nI didn't normally, he would have to, are you saying he has to look over the backseat\n\n38:05.080 --> 38:07.440\nto back out of the space and he would see the kid in the backseat?\n\n38:07.440 --> 38:09.240\nLet's say the, where is the kid sitting, front or backseat?\n\n38:09.240 --> 38:10.880\nThe kid's in a car seat in the back.\n\n38:10.880 --> 38:14.760\nSo let's say he would normally pull in face first.\n\n38:14.760 --> 38:19.000\nAnd so every other vehicle in the parking lot is like that, except for his, his is backed\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:20.000\nin.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:21.000\nBecause he doesn't want to walk past the backseat.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:22.000\nHe wants to walk forward.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:26.200\nIf he were to pull in forward, he has to get out and walk past the backseat and he'll\n\n38:26.200 --> 38:27.720\nsee the car seat.\n\n38:27.720 --> 38:29.200\nSo he avoids doing that.\n\n38:29.200 --> 38:34.160\nBut what he can't see as a sociopath is that he's actually redirecting that light.\n\n38:34.160 --> 38:38.800\nAnd so what that means is that by parking the vehicle and backing it in, what he's doing\n\n38:38.800 --> 38:44.720\nis he's creating a situation where he has to use the rear view and also the side mirror\n\n38:44.720 --> 38:46.600\nin order to back into the spot.\n\n38:46.600 --> 38:49.120\nAnd while doing that, he would very clearly see his son.\n\n38:49.120 --> 38:52.920\nHe would have used more, more light to see the reflection of his son in the backseat\n\n38:52.920 --> 38:53.920\nof the car.\n\n38:53.920 --> 38:58.760\nSo in fact, hours later, that's how he actually says he sees his son.\n\n38:58.760 --> 39:00.480\nHe says, I was changing a lane.\n\n39:00.480 --> 39:02.800\nI looked in the mirror and I saw him in the back.\n\n39:02.800 --> 39:05.760\nBut he would have seen that when he parked the vehicle.\n\n39:05.760 --> 39:08.040\nHe was not able to understand that though.\n\n39:08.040 --> 39:13.800\nYou've got, sometimes you have flare ups like, like that, I remember you saying about that\n\n39:13.800 --> 39:14.800\nguy.\n\n39:14.800 --> 39:17.200\nYou're like, but this guy, and he says this, but here's the thing.\n\n39:17.200 --> 39:20.280\nI'm about to squash his fucking life like a grape.\n\n39:20.280 --> 39:25.360\nLike you, you, you have, you have little, not his life, but you probably said like his logic\n\n39:25.360 --> 39:26.360\nor something.\n\n39:26.360 --> 39:33.720\nAnd you, I love that about you that you're like, you, you have nerd hulk outs, like you're,\n\n39:33.720 --> 39:37.360\nand then also you're like, you know, and I know, I know, I know half of you think I'm\n\n39:37.360 --> 39:39.640\nfull of fucking shit, but here's the thing.\n\n39:39.640 --> 39:40.640\nYou're fucking wrong.\n\n39:40.640 --> 39:47.360\nSo do you take, and now I can't wait to listen to the show, I'm sorry that I'm late to the\n\n39:47.360 --> 39:53.160\ngame on this, but like, do you take evidence that was already there and go, I picked that\n\n39:53.160 --> 39:57.920\nevidence for, for me to go, that's the thing, or do you put it all together and go, I'm\n\n39:57.920 --> 40:01.880\ngoing to make my own extrapolation out of that and, and say, here's what I think that\n\n40:01.880 --> 40:03.800\nno detective had already landed on.\n\n40:03.800 --> 40:04.800\nYeah.\n\n40:04.800 --> 40:07.920\nI mean, I generally try to extract whatever the human brain is doing.\n\n40:07.920 --> 40:13.280\nSo if I look into the psychology, then I'll start analyzing the philosophy of it and the\n\n40:13.280 --> 40:16.520\nsociology as well and just go, just go off on a rant.\n\n40:16.520 --> 40:17.520\nRight.\n\n40:17.520 --> 40:21.520\nSo the car thing is like, he's creating plausible deniability almost, but creating plausible\n\n40:21.520 --> 40:26.480\ndeniability is someone, something a guilty person does so that they can then claim they're\n\n40:26.480 --> 40:27.480\ngetting away with it.\n\n40:27.480 --> 40:29.200\nSo that gets back to the redirection of light.\n\n40:29.200 --> 40:33.120\nHe's creating this incident where he could pretend to be telling the truth, but he's\n\n40:33.120 --> 40:38.880\nactually engineering a dishonest situation and that has evidence that looks like a dishonest\n\n40:38.880 --> 40:39.880\nsituation being created.\n\n40:39.880 --> 40:46.640\nIt takes energy to like, it almost think like it's like when you were talking about, oh,\n\n40:46.640 --> 40:48.920\nhe would have looked in his room every mirror and all that stuff.\n\n40:48.920 --> 40:54.680\nActually, that pales in comparison to the fact that like, if he pulled in head first\n\n40:54.680 --> 41:01.000\nto his parking spot every day and then that day backed in, boom, you're done.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:02.240\nRedirection of light, right?\n\n41:02.240 --> 41:07.520\nBecause he's doing something specific that day and he's doing it because what's on his\n\n41:07.520 --> 41:13.760\nmind is, I don't want anyone to perceive me as having seen my baby.\n\n41:13.760 --> 41:17.720\nI think people that back in for no reason are fucking weird just to start with.\n\n41:17.720 --> 41:25.440\nOh, I do that, I do that because at the end of the day, I wanted to go home.\n\n41:25.440 --> 41:27.200\nAt the beginning of the day, I have more energy.\n\n41:27.200 --> 41:34.360\nI'm like, I want to start the day, you've got so much energy, oh, man, I can't wait\n\n41:34.360 --> 41:39.800\nto do a fucking complicated maneuver forward to my grumpy self at the end of the day.\n\n41:39.800 --> 41:43.440\nIt's like me saying grumpy Dan, get out of here.\n\n41:43.440 --> 41:44.440\nIt's five o'clock.\n\n41:44.440 --> 41:45.440\nGet out of here.\n\n41:45.440 --> 41:46.440\nBeat traffic.\n\n41:46.440 --> 41:47.440\nThank you.\n\n41:47.440 --> 41:50.120\nRyan, does that make him psychopath or sociopath?\n\n41:50.120 --> 41:52.320\nI'm going to go with sociopath.\n\n41:52.320 --> 41:53.320\nYeah, definitely.\n\n41:53.320 --> 41:54.320\nBecause I'm lazy.\n\n41:54.320 --> 41:55.320\nI think that is sociopathic.\n\n41:55.320 --> 41:56.320\nYeah.\n\n41:56.320 --> 41:57.320\nNo, no, I love your Instagram workouts.\n\n41:57.320 --> 41:58.320\nOpportunistic.\n\n41:58.320 --> 42:05.920\nI'm like, this is a way to, I want to talk about your, like, but you're the, well, I\n\n42:05.920 --> 42:10.400\ndo want to say this redirection of light thing or like the thing that you do that's so specific,\n\n42:10.400 --> 42:16.080\nI want to, I want to insert there because I have said on this podcast, even to other\n\n42:16.080 --> 42:20.200\ntrue crime people, I'm like, you know, the true crime story that really bums me out,\n\n42:20.200 --> 42:25.080\nthat really freaks me out, keeps me up at night, was this Kaniqa Powell, is it Kamiqa\n\n42:25.080 --> 42:26.080\nor Kaniqa?\n\n42:26.080 --> 42:31.280\nIt was the young lady who, the guy came to her door, he pretended he was a UPS guy and\n\n42:31.280 --> 42:32.280\nall this stuff.\n\n42:32.280 --> 42:33.880\nThere was like two guys and all this stuff.\n\n42:33.880 --> 42:38.040\nShe was like, like, and then she ends up getting shot and there's no robbery, all this stuff.\n\n42:38.040 --> 42:43.240\nIt was just so disturbing to me because it felt, it was, it just filled me with anxiety\n\n42:43.240 --> 42:46.760\nand like, why isn't there a task force, what is going on?\n\n42:46.760 --> 42:53.360\nAnd he did an episode on it and it was like, as an example of what you, how what you do\n\n42:53.360 --> 42:55.440\ncan kind of actually be beneficial.\n\n42:55.440 --> 42:58.800\nYou have the same information that anyone else has, but you're tracing it through and\n\n42:58.800 --> 43:05.800\ngoing, what do the guy or guys that are doing this shit to her have in common?\n\n43:05.800 --> 43:07.680\nThey're idiots.\n\n43:07.680 --> 43:12.800\nI mean, they're bad at their job, like they're dumb, they're children.\n\n43:12.800 --> 43:17.000\nThey're trying to get into her apartment and they're doing a terrible job at it.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.280\nThey're failing every step of the way.\n\n43:19.280 --> 43:25.920\nAnd then following that track, that explains her death in the end because what happens\n\n43:25.920 --> 43:32.400\nto this poor young lady is she comes back, she's in her lobby of her own hotel place\n\n43:32.400 --> 43:39.560\nand then all we know is that some guy shoots her and runs away, but the way that you break\n\n43:39.560 --> 43:46.240\nit down is like, yeah, no, the same idiot children that were so desperate to have her\n\n43:46.240 --> 43:52.640\nin her apartment, they were, that desperation planted them like children, idiot children\n\n43:52.640 --> 43:57.560\nwhere she lived, waited for her to come back, did what idiot children would do.\n\n43:57.560 --> 43:59.840\nShe reacted the way an adult would.\n\n43:59.840 --> 44:03.480\nThey reacted the way a child would because she wasn't going to go in a fucking apartment\n\n44:03.480 --> 44:07.920\nwith a fucking child with a gun that's been trying to get, she's like, no fuck you, I'm\n\n44:07.920 --> 44:15.840\na military trained adult and this person shot her and ran like a child.\n\n44:15.840 --> 44:22.280\nAnd that is why it's like, oh, there was no, her wallet wasn't taken and all this stuff,\n\n44:22.280 --> 44:26.160\nwhich is the stuff that panicked me because I was like, this is a professional hit, how\n\n44:26.160 --> 44:31.840\nare we ignoring this, we need, the government killed her.\n\n44:31.840 --> 44:37.080\nAnd instead you're like, no, this is all explained and the guy that did it was active in that\n\n44:37.080 --> 44:41.320\narea and then stopped being active, he's in prison right now, he did this kind of thing,\n\n44:41.320 --> 44:44.960\nhe probably did that, he wouldn't confess to it because that would add to his time and\n\n44:44.960 --> 44:47.160\nit's all good.\n\n44:47.160 --> 44:53.760\nIt's like you, your unique way of looking at things like actually had like, it was like\n\n44:53.760 --> 44:57.280\nyou solved the case for me, you made me sleep at night.\n\n44:57.280 --> 45:03.800\nDo you think Ryan that, not having listened to the show, and I will, I promise, that what\n\n45:03.800 --> 45:07.680\nyou're good at, what makes your show good, do you think that you might be valuable as\n\n45:07.680 --> 45:08.680\na resource to law enforcement?\n\n45:08.680 --> 45:12.400\nI think he should be an actual detective, use answer it.\n\n45:12.400 --> 45:20.560\nYou know, I've actually never really given any thought to that, I have had people approach\n\n45:20.560 --> 45:26.160\nme and say, hey, did you ever think that you could contribute to law enforcement, I'm not\n\n45:26.160 --> 45:30.640\nso sure that a lot of what I do is very grounded, but I think it is.\n\n45:30.640 --> 45:36.920\nI mean, I wouldn't say you would be a great, you wouldn't hold up in a courtroom necessarily,\n\n45:36.920 --> 45:40.080\nbut then again, like profilers and people that like, you might be the person that they\n\n45:40.080 --> 45:42.920\ngo to and just go like, like Ryan, what do you think about this guy?\n\n45:42.920 --> 45:46.920\nHe sounds like, you know, he sounds like a classic number 17.\n\n45:46.920 --> 45:49.640\nYeah, I definitely think I would be beneficial in that way for sure.\n\n45:49.640 --> 45:50.640\nYeah, that'd be great.\n\n45:50.640 --> 45:56.000\nDo you think that, because you would consider yourself like the equivalent of like a psychic\n\n45:56.000 --> 46:02.160\nin the sense that if it works, it works, well, sometimes, yeah, well, there's like, there's\n\n46:02.160 --> 46:07.280\ncrime shows about a guy who's like his eyebrows twitching, you know what that means is thinking\n\n46:07.280 --> 46:08.280\nabout his mom.\n\n46:08.280 --> 46:11.680\nAnd it's like, that's not going to hold up in court, but in the TV show, it works fucking\n\n46:11.680 --> 46:14.360\ngreat because that makes the guy confessed and then that does work.\n\n46:14.360 --> 46:18.840\nWell, if it helps you knock on the right door, and then that guy tries to crawl the window,\n\n46:18.840 --> 46:19.840\nyou got it.\n\n46:19.840 --> 46:20.840\nYeah.\n\n46:20.840 --> 46:21.960\nIt's like, oh, how'd you, how'd you knock on my door?\n\n46:21.960 --> 46:24.640\nA profiler told us, what the fuck's a profiler?\n\n46:24.640 --> 46:29.040\nYeah, that shit doesn't hold up in court, but like, and sometimes that's a psychic.\n\n46:29.040 --> 46:34.360\nLike you hear law enforcement sometimes say, they have this like weird relationship with\n\n46:34.360 --> 46:40.200\npsychics that call in because they're kind of going, and I heard you say this on your\n\n46:40.200 --> 46:45.720\npodcast where what I'm hearing you say is something that agent Dale Cooper on Twin Peaks\n\n46:45.720 --> 46:52.160\nwould say, which is if, if the make you sound more legitimate, by the way, if the linear\n\n46:52.160 --> 46:57.440\npath isn't working, figure out any other way to look at this.\n\n46:57.440 --> 47:01.840\nAnd so sometimes you'll go, so I'm looking at this whole thing from the perspective of\n\n47:01.840 --> 47:07.480\nJohn Hughes movies, and it's like, well, wait, that's not, but then you're like, now looking\n\n47:07.480 --> 47:11.680\nat that from that perspective, you discover different details, or you notice different\n\n47:11.680 --> 47:17.800\nconnections, and then you draw different conclusions, which more often than not solve the crime.\n\n47:17.800 --> 47:18.800\nIt's a good podcast.\n\n47:18.800 --> 47:24.000\nLike, speaking of movies, like, it's like an old, like, like an old Western, like you'd\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:30.840\nbe a great like country judge, like, I know the law says this and the law says that, but\n\n47:30.840 --> 47:32.320\nno, you're, he's a Pinkerton.\n\n47:32.320 --> 47:33.320\nHe's a Pinkerton.\n\n47:33.320 --> 47:45.440\nThis guy's clearly from, I don't know if you've ever seen 16 candles, but, but like, do you\n\n47:45.440 --> 47:49.320\nlike, just talk about that for a second, because you've addressed that a couple of times in\n\n47:49.320 --> 47:55.600\nyour podcast, like, it's sort of like, it's you, you're a hero to me because you kind\n\n47:55.600 --> 48:00.400\nof like, everyone's around like, wait, this guy believes in voodoo.\n\n48:00.400 --> 48:05.880\nAnd then you're, and then the other sentence, you're like, oh no, you're like such a, you're\n\n48:05.880 --> 48:12.960\nsuch a, like, logician, and you're bridging some gap there, where you believe that it's\n\n48:12.960 --> 48:15.480\nall about perspective or something.\n\n48:15.480 --> 48:19.880\nYeah, I mean, I think there's part of my show that I guess I should probably clarify.\n\n48:19.880 --> 48:21.760\nI've always been very polarizing.\n\n48:21.760 --> 48:25.280\nAnd obviously, you know that a lot, I mean, a lot of people hate my show.\n\n48:25.280 --> 48:31.760\nSo it's always been, oh, it's always been about logic and about trolling people as well.\n\n48:31.760 --> 48:34.080\nBecause I have a lot of hate listeners.\n\n48:34.080 --> 48:37.120\nAnd so do you actively troll people?\n\n48:37.120 --> 48:38.880\nI think my show is an active troll.\n\n48:38.880 --> 48:42.640\nI think a five hour episode is pretty much, you know, no, no, I mean, you're not like,\n\n48:42.640 --> 48:46.320\noh, I know, I'm only doing this because my haters are going to hate it.\n\n48:46.320 --> 48:47.800\nNo, no, absolutely not.\n\n48:47.800 --> 48:50.880\nNo, I mean, just the general nature of the show and how I put it together.\n\n48:50.880 --> 48:52.380\nWhat is the average?\n\n48:52.380 --> 48:56.160\nThe things that, wait, when I find trolling the people who hate the show, that's usually\n\n48:56.160 --> 48:57.960\nto the benefit of the people who like it.\n\n48:57.960 --> 48:58.960\nYeah.\n\n48:58.960 --> 49:02.720\nWhat is your average troll beefing about with your show that it's too not logic based\n\n49:02.720 --> 49:03.720\nor?\n\n49:03.720 --> 49:10.880\nOh, it's like, it's anything from the production to the audacity of my conclusions to my voice\n\n49:10.880 --> 49:13.280\nto the way I present things to the cadence.\n\n49:13.280 --> 49:19.880\nBut that's great because you're doing basically more of, you're doing an opinion piece.\n\n49:19.880 --> 49:25.520\nYou're lending your own subjective ideas on the things.\n\n49:25.520 --> 49:31.400\nAnd the people that edit opinion editorial pages and newspapers, they love the hate mail.\n\n49:31.400 --> 49:34.760\nThat means people are reading and that means that we're creating a conversation.\n\n49:34.760 --> 49:35.760\nSo that's good.\n\n49:35.760 --> 49:36.760\nYeah.\n\n49:36.760 --> 49:37.760\nI mean, that's definitely part of what I do.\n\n49:37.760 --> 49:41.600\nYou know, a lot of true crime shows you listen to, regardless of whether they're good or\n\n49:41.600 --> 49:46.360\nbad, you know, there's kind of a thing where people are not quite committing to certain\n\n49:46.360 --> 49:48.200\nconclusion in a case for whatever reason.\n\n49:48.200 --> 49:52.360\nI mean, it might not be what the show is about, but I tend to just be audacious and go for\n\n49:52.360 --> 49:53.600\nit and just say what I think.\n\n49:53.600 --> 49:57.360\nI think it's an interesting intersection between true crime and podcasting is that the part\n\n49:57.360 --> 50:01.480\nof you that wants to podcast is the part of you that wants somebody out there to like\n\n50:01.480 --> 50:02.480\nyou.\n\n50:02.480 --> 50:04.360\nOtherwise, why podcast it?\n\n50:04.360 --> 50:08.360\nBut the part of you that likes true crime is the part of you that wants to acknowledge\n\n50:08.360 --> 50:12.920\nthat life is disgusting and toxic and predatory.\n\n50:12.920 --> 50:14.520\nAnd so it's tough.\n\n50:14.520 --> 50:20.560\nI've talked to the red handed gals about this, how it's like, I like them because they're,\n\n50:20.560 --> 50:24.840\nthey don't, they don't constantly pause and I understand the constant pauses with true\n\n50:24.840 --> 50:28.680\ncrime podcasters where they're like, by the way, this is about the victim and not about\n\n50:28.680 --> 50:31.520\nthe, oh, no one wants to hear about what Jack the Ripper did.\n\n50:31.520 --> 50:32.840\nHe's not a hero or anything.\n\n50:32.840 --> 50:35.800\nBut anyways, this episode is called Jack the Ripper.\n\n50:35.800 --> 50:46.000\nAnd it's really about the victims and it's like, I like that you're, I mean, we need\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:53.480\npeople that are, you clearly hear the haters and then you're like, all right, that's expected,\n\n50:53.480 --> 50:54.480\nbut here's the thing.\n\n50:54.480 --> 50:57.000\nI'm a genius.\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:58.240\nOf course you'd hate that.\n\n50:58.240 --> 51:00.040\nI'm going to blow your fucking mind.\n\n51:00.040 --> 51:04.600\nIs it ever a guest or is it just you just straight to Mike?\n\n51:04.600 --> 51:05.600\nIt's just me.\n\n51:05.600 --> 51:09.320\nIt'd be funny to hear a guest.\n\n51:09.320 --> 51:13.920\nCan I be for the first guest because I would be like, oh, shit, the air conditioner went\n\n51:13.920 --> 51:14.920\non again.\n\n51:14.920 --> 51:15.920\nI sit there with Cody.\n\n51:15.920 --> 51:16.920\nI'm like, oh, God damn it.\n\n51:16.920 --> 51:17.920\nThe air conditioner went on.\n\n51:17.920 --> 51:19.480\nWho wants to see Dan on the show?\n\n51:19.480 --> 51:22.960\nI mean, it's his audience.\n\n51:22.960 --> 51:29.120\nDon't let me ruin your show, though, like I don't set the sociopath, you're like an\n\n51:29.120 --> 51:31.920\nooze trying to get in and destroy his show.\n\n51:31.920 --> 51:33.080\nI don't want to ruin things.\n\n51:33.080 --> 51:38.920\nI debated on the show because I really, that's how much affection I have for your show and\n\n51:38.920 --> 51:40.760\nthere for you is like, we talked about that.\n\n51:40.760 --> 51:42.880\nI was like, I don't want to keep doing this thing.\n\n51:42.880 --> 51:46.680\nI don't want to keep jabbing my ruler into primordial ooze.\n\n51:46.680 --> 51:49.560\nI love true crime podcasting because it's punk rock.\n\n51:49.560 --> 51:56.480\nI think it's fucked up that I'm kind of getting tired of like laying in bed with Cody and\n\n51:56.480 --> 52:02.520\nthen the neck and it's like, oh, in other news, I guess I'm going on Harmontown and\n\n52:02.520 --> 52:04.080\nI'm kind of like, am I fucking up?\n\n52:04.080 --> 52:05.080\nAm I fucking up?\n\n52:05.080 --> 52:06.200\nOr am I signal boosting?\n\n52:06.200 --> 52:07.400\nI want a signal boost.\n\n52:07.400 --> 52:08.600\nI don't want to fuck up.\n\n52:08.600 --> 52:10.640\nYou're not here for me.\n\n52:10.640 --> 52:11.640\nLet's talk about you.\n\n52:11.640 --> 52:12.640\nCan I ask a question?\n\n52:12.640 --> 52:18.240\nI'm fascinated about, we talked briefly that you left corporate, can we ask what the corporate\n\n52:18.240 --> 52:19.240\ngig was?\n\n52:19.240 --> 52:20.240\nWhat were you doing before?\n\n52:20.240 --> 52:21.240\nYou founded Tesla.\n\n52:21.240 --> 52:22.240\nWhoa.\n\n52:22.240 --> 52:27.240\nNo, I was an executive assistant to the CIO of my company.\n\n52:27.240 --> 52:28.880\nThat's all I was doing.\n\n52:28.880 --> 52:32.000\nI needed a corporate job that had a decent paycheck.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:35.160\nWhat kind of job, was it like tech or something like that?\n\n52:35.160 --> 52:36.160\nOh, yeah.\n\n52:36.160 --> 52:39.440\nIt was an IT department for a commercial real estate company.\n\n52:39.440 --> 52:41.440\nAnd then you started podcasting about true crime.\n\n52:41.440 --> 52:43.800\nWas it your first podcast or was it your first foray into it?\n\n52:43.800 --> 52:44.800\nYeah.\n\n52:44.800 --> 52:48.760\nI mean, I'd just been writing for a long time and it wasn't really paying off as well as\n\n52:48.760 --> 52:49.760\nI'd liked.\n\n52:49.760 --> 52:53.160\nI just figured I just needed a way to distribute my work so that I could get it in front of\n\n52:53.160 --> 52:54.400\na lot of people.\n\n52:54.400 --> 52:56.200\nAnd podcasting was just the natural way to go.\n\n52:56.200 --> 52:57.360\nI mean, there are other factors involved.\n\n52:57.360 --> 53:03.880\nAnd it went so well that you could say goodbye to your Santa Monica West Side corporate\n\n53:03.880 --> 53:07.280\njob that paid probably pretty well.\n\n53:07.280 --> 53:10.760\nAnd then you can just go, fuck it, I'm leaving to Arizona and I'm just going to make people\n\n53:10.760 --> 53:12.480\non the internet mad about murders.\n\n53:12.480 --> 53:14.840\nYeah, pretty much.\n\n53:14.840 --> 53:15.840\nThat's the way it went.\n\n53:15.840 --> 53:16.840\nYeah.\n\n53:16.840 --> 53:19.800\nI mean, they just followed your own weird joy on that one and just said, this is what\n\n53:19.800 --> 53:20.800\nI want to do.\n\n53:20.800 --> 53:21.800\nOh, totally.\n\n53:21.800 --> 53:22.800\nYeah.\n\n53:22.800 --> 53:23.800\nI mean, I just worked nonstop.\n\n53:23.800 --> 53:25.640\nAnd it was like, I got to a point where I was exhausted and I was like, that has to\n\n53:25.640 --> 53:26.920\nbe one thing or the other.\n\n53:26.920 --> 53:28.440\nAnd I wanted it to be the creative side.\n\n53:28.440 --> 53:29.920\nThat's so cool.\n\n53:29.920 --> 53:32.360\nThat's just inspirationally awesome.\n\n53:32.360 --> 53:33.360\nYeah.\n\n53:33.360 --> 53:35.960\nI mean, that's off to that.\n\n53:35.960 --> 53:41.960\nAnd everyone listening to that, just do the thing that you're obsessed about.\n\n53:41.960 --> 53:46.640\nThat's the bright side of a shitty dehumanizing internet is that it should be providing.\n\n53:46.640 --> 53:47.640\nYeah.\n\n53:47.640 --> 53:48.640\nThat's what I love about it.\n\n53:48.640 --> 53:53.520\nAs I said to What's His Fuck, I'm going to ask the episode, What's His Fuck, Doctor\n\n53:53.520 --> 53:54.520\nWhat's His Fuck.\n\n53:54.520 --> 53:56.640\nOh, the What's His Guy, overheard LA.\n\n53:56.640 --> 53:59.880\nI'm like, I love the internet.\n\n53:59.880 --> 54:06.320\nFor all of its stories about how it destroys people with its fucking acidic dehumanization,\n\n54:06.320 --> 54:14.520\nit's also like, yeah, but before it existed, you couldn't just go, tell me one more time\n\n54:14.520 --> 54:18.400\nto reload this paper tray, you piece of shit.\n\n54:18.400 --> 54:22.880\nI'm going to go home, grab a Yeti mic from Best Buy.\n\n54:22.880 --> 54:23.880\nThat's what Mike I have too.\n\n54:23.880 --> 54:24.880\nHell yeah.\n\n54:24.880 --> 54:25.880\nHell yeah.\n\n54:25.880 --> 54:28.160\nI can't figure out how to make those things work.\n\n54:28.160 --> 54:30.440\nThey're a lot better than these ones.\n\n54:30.440 --> 54:33.640\nThey're not better, but they have a, you could talk a lot farther away.\n\n54:33.640 --> 54:37.480\nYou can just like, and it's not about like, oh, you're either Mozart or you don't know\n\n54:37.480 --> 54:38.760\nhow to play piano.\n\n54:38.760 --> 54:44.120\nI like the depth of that hierarchy and the birth of that circular system where it's like,\n\n54:44.120 --> 54:53.760\nreally, you don't know who, maybe the reason I was born is because I'm neither, I'm just\n\n54:53.760 --> 54:54.760\nme.\n\n54:54.760 --> 54:55.760\nI love that.\n\n54:55.760 --> 55:01.160\nThat people go like, yes, she's just her, and then we praise these stories and go, she\n\n55:01.160 --> 55:02.160\nwas just her.\n\n55:02.160 --> 55:05.280\nNo, she's a billionaire, and then we ruin that person.\n\n55:05.280 --> 55:10.400\nBut I like that idea of that ever-widening marketplace where it's like, you can just\n\n55:10.400 --> 55:17.720\nbe you, and then we, you know, well, YouTube, we all need someone while we're just being\n\n55:17.720 --> 55:23.080\nus to, I don't know, drill the oil and stuff, but we'll go out to other countries for that.\n\n55:23.080 --> 55:27.000\nWhen podcasting first came around, like I was, you know, I'm the old buddy that is like,\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:28.000\nwhat's a blog?\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:33.320\nIt was a combination of two words, it's stupid, and what's a podcast, it's dumb, and of course\n\n55:33.320 --> 55:38.760\nI've been doing a podcast for a thousand years, but like, there is kind of a little\n\n55:38.760 --> 55:43.800\nart movement to it where people just like, there's little pockets of humanity, it could\n\n55:43.800 --> 55:47.440\nbe anywhere in the world, it doesn't have to be in New York or, you know, Hollywood,\n\n55:47.440 --> 55:52.360\nand just sit down and just talk about stuff, and people fall in love with it, and that's\n\n55:52.360 --> 55:58.880\ncloser to like, 60s and 70s punk rock in New York, like people just going, I'm not a great\n\n55:58.880 --> 56:03.200\nguitar player, I just know I want to go into these shitty little clubs and just scream into\n\n56:03.200 --> 56:04.200\na microphone.\n\n56:04.200 --> 56:08.320\nNow, I don't want to be this guy.\n\n56:08.320 --> 56:11.120\nBut if you did, it would go a little something, like this.\n\n56:11.120 --> 56:15.880\nSaid the guy who didn't want to be that guy, never.\n\n56:15.880 --> 56:19.680\nOn steroids.\n\n56:19.680 --> 56:23.640\nBut we should, I really want to, here's what I want to do.\n\n56:23.640 --> 56:28.880\nI want to send Ryan out of the room, stage a murder.\n\n56:28.880 --> 56:29.880\nOkay.\n\n56:29.880 --> 56:30.880\nWhy stage it?\n\n56:30.880 --> 56:38.280\nWell, not stage a murder, but like, have a truth that we know and that you don't know\n\n56:38.280 --> 56:44.600\nhave you come back, and just like, I don't know, kind of have you examine it.\n\n56:44.600 --> 56:45.600\nRight.\n\n56:45.600 --> 56:50.600\nIt's not to test you, it's just to like, okay, how about this, how about this, I'll take\n\n56:50.600 --> 56:55.000\nRyan into the green room, we'll cover our ears, and then have like, leave here, somebody\n\n56:55.000 --> 57:00.120\ncome get us, but I'll be like your, oh, you want me in on the job?\n\n57:00.120 --> 57:03.280\nYeah, have someone else cover his ears, we have people for that.\n\n57:03.280 --> 57:06.000\nWe did build that sound group.\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:12.040\nIn my mind, I would be like the shitty local detective who brought in the fancy podcast\n\n57:12.040 --> 57:13.040\nprofiler.\n\n57:13.040 --> 57:14.040\nOkay, you're okay.\n\n57:14.040 --> 57:15.040\nAll right.\n\n57:15.040 --> 57:18.520\nI'm using just my regular cop training, but he's got the superpower.\n\n57:18.520 --> 57:21.920\nAll right, but then what are Spencer and I left doing, like one of us murders the other,\n\n57:21.920 --> 57:25.080\nand I just want to figure out like,\n\n57:25.080 --> 57:28.080\nWell, what we can, that's the hardest part is fine, like, how are we going to come up\n\n57:28.080 --> 57:29.080\nwith a crime?\n\n57:29.080 --> 57:32.400\nAll we need to do is decide on something conversationally.\n\n57:32.400 --> 57:33.400\nDecide on what?\n\n57:33.400 --> 57:40.480\nWell, like, we decide like, what happened, and then we decide who did it.\n\n57:40.480 --> 57:41.480\nThat's all very difficult.\n\n57:41.480 --> 57:42.480\nIt is hard.\n\n57:42.480 --> 57:43.480\nIt's hard.\n\n57:43.480 --> 57:44.480\nYeah, okay, we could do it though.\n\n57:44.480 --> 57:48.160\nBut we can do it, but then once we know the truth, then definitively we'll be lying.\n\n57:48.160 --> 57:51.280\nWell, how about, is anybody in our audience, has anyone actually committed a murder that\n\n57:51.280 --> 57:52.280\nhas not been told yet?\n\n57:52.280 --> 57:53.280\nI want to do it.\n\n57:53.280 --> 57:54.280\nYeah, please tell me.\n\n57:54.280 --> 57:55.280\nWho is it?\n\n57:55.280 --> 57:56.280\nWait, wait, we can figure this out.\n\n57:56.280 --> 57:57.280\nWe can figure this out.\n\n57:57.280 --> 57:58.280\nYeah.\n\n57:58.280 --> 57:59.280\nDo you want it?\n\n57:59.280 --> 58:00.280\nYeah.\n\n58:00.280 --> 58:02.040\nYeah, using someone from the audience is a good idea.\n\n58:02.040 --> 58:06.440\nI like that start, but like, we can't murder people.\n\n58:06.440 --> 58:08.960\nWell, let's not rule that out just yet.\n\n58:08.960 --> 58:09.960\nI don't want them to murder you.\n\n58:09.960 --> 58:10.960\nWe need all options on the table.\n\n58:10.960 --> 58:11.960\nBut like, ah, fuck.\n\n58:11.960 --> 58:12.960\nYou can't murder the audience.\n\n58:12.960 --> 58:13.960\nI don't know.\n\n58:13.960 --> 58:14.960\nYou don't have any suggestions.\n\n58:14.960 --> 58:15.960\nWe don't know that.\n\n58:15.960 --> 58:19.640\nLike, how does redirection of late work backwards where you could be like, you know, what would\n\n58:19.640 --> 58:20.640\nmake you?\n\n58:20.640 --> 58:21.640\nWhat about this?\n\n58:21.640 --> 58:26.160\nDoes anybody, because when you watch these, you know, these murder shows and or listen\n\n58:26.160 --> 58:30.240\nto the true crime podcast kind of things, do you ever kind of fantasize like, I think\n\n58:30.240 --> 58:35.200\nI have the perfect crime, or if I wanted to like do somebody, this is how I think I would\n\n58:35.200 --> 58:36.200\nget away with it.\n\n58:36.200 --> 58:40.240\nIf anybody, does anybody have one now, because like, because I've got like five.\n\n58:40.240 --> 58:44.520\nYeah, but that's, if you have a good one, you never want to share it out loud, especially\n\n58:44.520 --> 58:46.760\non a recording.\n\n58:46.760 --> 58:48.600\nThat's like rule number one of my plan.\n\n58:48.600 --> 58:52.200\nYeah, but this would be a great way, this would be a great way to expiate that and go\n\n58:52.200 --> 58:56.160\nlike, I could never do that now, because I've said it on one of the world's most famous\n\n58:56.160 --> 58:57.160\npodcasts.\n\n58:57.160 --> 59:01.200\nAnd actually what we could do is an improvement on our 911 call thing, but the thing that\n\n59:01.200 --> 59:07.280\nwe did wrong last time is the ladies were in the room and then we, if we send you guys\n\n59:07.280 --> 59:14.880\nout of the room and then Spencer and I, we decide on a scenario and then we, we bring\n\n59:14.880 --> 59:20.280\nyou guys back in and we make our 911 calls based on what we know is the truth.\n\n59:20.280 --> 59:21.280\nYeah.\n\n59:21.280 --> 59:22.280\nYeah.\n\n59:22.280 --> 59:23.280\nI like that.\n\n59:23.280 --> 59:24.280\nI think I'm close there.\n\n59:24.280 --> 59:25.280\nYeah.\n\n59:25.280 --> 59:26.280\nYeah, that's good.\n\n59:26.280 --> 59:27.280\nNo, no.\n\n59:27.280 --> 59:28.280\nYes.\n\n59:28.280 --> 59:34.960\nI got to go back and do a little, honestly, I think you can stay for this version.\n\n59:34.960 --> 59:35.960\nOkay.\n\n59:35.960 --> 59:36.960\nHe doesn't need his ears.\n\n59:36.960 --> 59:40.680\nI was just saying that like, like I'm the shitty cop, I'm the local, you know, knucklehead\n\n59:40.680 --> 59:42.180\ndetective from Colorado Springs.\n\n59:42.180 --> 59:44.920\nI think we can give him a choice of three 911 calls.\n\n59:44.920 --> 59:50.160\nIf he covers his ears, leaves the room and then comes back in and we've decided on what\n\n59:50.160 --> 59:54.960\nreally happened because then we'll have a truth in our head and then we make a 911 call.\n\n59:54.960 --> 59:55.960\nWe're all making 911 calls?\n\n59:55.960 --> 59:56.960\nYeah.\n\n59:56.960 --> 59:57.960\nOh right.\n\n59:57.960 --> 59:58.960\nWe're all covering up the same crime.\n\n59:58.960 --> 59:59.960\nYep.\n\n59:59.960 --> 01:00:00.960\nI got you.\n\n01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.960\nThat's what we did wrong last time.\n\n01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:02.960\nI have no idea.\n\n01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.960\nBecause we were making up crime.\n\n01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.960\nThat's for the best.\n\n01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.960\nYou know, Steve Levy is a wonderful conversationalist.\n\n01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.960\nHe'll take you in the alley.\n\n01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:07.960\nHe'll chat you up.\n\n01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.960\nIt'll be grand.\n\n01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:09.960\nSteve Levy.\n\n01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.960\nCan you come out here please?\n\n01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.960\nLevy to the stage.\n\n01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.960\nOh, what are you saying?\n\n01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:13.960\nI'm getting set up to get murdered.\n\n01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.960\nWhat's that?\n\n01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.960\nAm I getting set up to get murdered here?\n\n01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.960\nYeah.\n\n01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.480\nIt'd be the perfect crime because we'd be like, I don't know what happened to him.\n\n01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.960\nWe were talking about murder and then he never came back.\n\n01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.960\nBy the way, back alley code seven.\n\n01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.960\nWhat if this is the perfect crime?\n\n01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.960\nWe wouldn't be recording it.\n\n01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.960\nNo, we would be because we'd be recording it and it sounds so guileless.\n\n01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.960\nEven what I'm doing right now, which is getting like meta and like laying layers onto it.\n\n01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:38.960\nI don't know.\n\n01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.960\nThis is a couple of guiles to me.\n\n01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.960\nThis is where we find out, by the way, that Steve during the show has been murdered.\n\n01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.700\nWell, no, this is when he lives his real life.\n\n01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.960\nHe goes to Newark and like does coke and shit.\n\n01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.960\nOr he fights crime where he's out there murdering people.\n\n01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:52.960\nYeah.\n\n01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:53.960\nHe's like Nightwing.\n\n01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:54.960\nHe's never...\n\n01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.960\nOh, that's what he does.\n\n01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.960\nHe comes out to bring the vodka that nobody asked to create an alibi.\n\n01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.960\nIt's an alibi.\n\n01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:01.960\nYeah.\n\n01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960\nMeanwhile.\n\n01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.960\nAnd then he goes and fucking does a show with Bet Midler.\n\n01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.960\nYes.\n\n01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.960\nHe's the MacArthur Park handjobber.\n\n01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.960\nAre you comfortable with this?\n\n01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.960\nHe's the MacArthur Park handjobber.\n\n01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.960\nThe least sought after criminal.\n\n01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.960\nLike no one wants him caught.\n\n01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:17.960\nOr her.\n\n01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:18.960\nWe don't know.\n\n01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.960\nLet's see.\n\n01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.960\nI mean, here's the problem.\n\n01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.960\nPeople say Victor was crying, but it's just too vigorous.\n\n01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.960\nIt's kind of like a blow.\n\n01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.960\nIt's like fucking at least, you know...\n\n01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.960\nThe MacArthur Park handjobber.\n\n01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.960\nCriminal or Samaritan.\n\n01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.960\nOr yeah.\n\n01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.960\nTonight at 11.\n\n01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.960\nLike they...\n\n01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.960\nAnd I said, like you just have like college kids going like, a guy came out or a lady,\n\n01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.960\nI don't know.\n\n01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.960\nYou know, like a satin glove on, they said, do you want a handjob?\n\n01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.960\nI said, no, they left.\n\n01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:53.960\nI was in MacArthur Park.\n\n01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.960\nI like the ducks.\n\n01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.960\nOkay.\n\n01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.960\nSo I just have...\n\n01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.960\nPeople are asking, are they a criminal?\n\n01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.960\nAnd then someone else is like, I said, yes, best handjob of my life.\n\n01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.960\nLike no one can figure out, should we catch this person?\n\n01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.960\nOr should we all be them?\n\n01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960\nI just...\n\n01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.960\nSo I think, well, are we all covering up the crime or is one of us covering up the crime\n\n01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.960\nand the other two are being honest?\n\n01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.960\nI think somebody should go, oh, like my loved one was attacked.\n\n01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.960\nWell, we'll all say that.\n\n01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960\nYeah, that could be the murder.\n\n01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.960\nI think what we need to do is, and don't leave yet, so let's figure this out.\n\n01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:32.960\nSo the idea is we would send Ryan out and then we would decide while he's out on a...\n\n01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.960\nOn the specifics of a crime, I guess.\n\n01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960\nRight.\n\n01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960\nThis is where it all falls apart.\n\n01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.960\nNo, no, that part I guess.\n\n01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.960\nIt's already falling apart.\n\n01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.960\nWell, that's to be sure.\n\n01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:44.960\nAnd then he would come in and we would basically do our 911 calls.\n\n01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.960\nRight.\n\n01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:46.960\nI don't know.\n\n01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.960\nBut are we all guilty?\n\n01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.960\nBecause then he'd just say, yeah, you're all guilty.\n\n01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.960\nOr is one of us guilty?\n\n01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.960\nI'd say...\n\n01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.960\nOh, no, no.\n\n01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:54.960\nOnly one of us is guilty.\n\n01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.960\nRight, okay.\n\n01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.960\nIf one or two people are guilty.\n\n01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:57.960\nIt could be only one person.\n\n01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.960\nIt could be two people.\n\n01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:59.960\nIt has to be one person.\n\n01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.960\nAnd then we see if he can pick the guilty person.\n\n01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.960\nYou should pick an actual victim here and just have somebody leave the room.\n\n01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.960\nRight.\n\n01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.960\nI'll try to figure out who it is.\n\n01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.960\nThe audience member has to leave.\n\n01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.960\nThey can't see the rest of the show.\n\n01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.960\nOkay.\n\n01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.960\nJust for a minute.\n\n01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960\nHow about this?\n\n01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.960\nHow about this?\n\n01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.960\nThe four of us stay here and the whole audience leaves.\n\n01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.960\nYou give me an hour.\n\n01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.960\nWe could do just that.\n\n01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.960\nCan we try?\n\n01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.960\nI feel like the audience would be frustrated if we don't just try it.\n\n01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:24.960\nYeah.\n\n01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.960\nOkay.\n\n01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.960\nRyan, get out of here.\n\n01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.960\nWe're going to try it.\n\n01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.960\nThanks so much.\n\n01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960\nSteve Levy doesn't exist.\n\n01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:35.960\nGo backstage and plug your ears and we'll call you unplug your ears.\n\n01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.960\nHonor system Ryan.\n\n01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.960\nPlug your ears and say la la la.\n\n01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.960\nAnd even if this doesn't work, it's just another...\n\n01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960\nSteve, turn down the monitor.\n\n01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.960\nAll right.\n\n01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:43.960\nThe one in the back.\n\n01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960\nNot these ones.\n\n01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.960\nThese are good.\n\n01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.960\nHe doesn't exist or he would have come up here by now.\n\n01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.960\nI'm going to go check in the back of the show.\n\n01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.960\nSteve loves smoking.\n\n01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.960\nAll right.\n\n01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.960\nSo how this would work is we would decide on a crime that happened, right?\n\n01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.960\nThere's a dead baby.\n\n01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:58.960\nA dead baby.\n\n01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.960\nIn a bucket.\n\n01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:00.960\nOkay.\n\n01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.960\nCan it be a four-year-old?\n\n01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.960\nSorry.\n\n01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:06.960\nSorry.\n\n01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.960\nIt has to be a four-year-old.\n\n01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.960\nOkay.\n\n01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:09.960\nGreat.\n\n01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.960\nSo it's a dead four-year-old in a bucket.\n\n01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.960\nUh-huh.\n\n01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.960\nBy a river.\n\n01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.960\nRight.\n\n01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.960\nAnd either we found it or we killed it.\n\n01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.960\nRight.\n\n01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.960\nIs it working, Jeff?\n\n01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.960\nTo talk a little longer.\n\n01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.960\nOkay.\n\n01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.960\nAll right.\n\n01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.960\nAll right.\n\n01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:21.960\nLet's just...\n\n01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.960\nWe could...\n\n01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:23.960\nWhat?\n\n01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.960\nThat's fair.\n\n01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.960\nYou know.\n\n01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:26.960\nWe're going to...\n\n01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.960\nIt's going to have to be a...\n\n01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.960\nJust don't eat the mic.\n\n01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.960\nOkay.\n\n01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:30.960\nAll right.\n\n01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.960\nSo we were talking about it's a dead baby.\n\n01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.960\nHuh?\n\n01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.960\nEither we found it or we...\n\n01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:35.960\nRight.\n\n01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.960\nOr we're the reason it's there.\n\n01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:37.960\nRight.\n\n01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:38.960\nNow it's too quiet.\n\n01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.960\nI couldn't hear what you said.\n\n01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.960\nWhen you kill a person...\n\n01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.960\nRight.\n\n01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.960\nUsually, like, you either found it.\n\n01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.960\nIt's kind of whoever smelled it dealt it.\n\n01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.960\nLike, you're either the person that finds the body.\n\n01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.960\nAll right.\n\n01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.960\nSo who's going to be guilty?\n\n01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.960\nOkay.\n\n01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.960\nDon't say it on the mic.\n\n01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.960\nJust let's raise hands.\n\n01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.960\nOkay.\n\n01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.960\nWell, we need to pick...\n\n01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.960\nSomeone from the audience come up and pick.\n\n01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:01.960\nOkay.\n\n01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.960\nYou want to come up and pick whoever's going to be the murderer.\n\n01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.960\nRight.\n\n01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:05.960\nCome on up.\n\n01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:06.960\nOkay.\n\n01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960\nSo that's a...\n\n01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.960\nIt's not an audible process.\n\n01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.960\nAll right.\n\n01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.960\nAnd if you have anything to plug, we'll also...\n\n01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.960\nA SoundCloud or anything?\n\n01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.960\nOkay.\n\n01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.960\nYou deserve...\n\n01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:17.960\nYou deserve something.\n\n01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:18.960\nOkay.\n\n01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.960\nSo you're going to pick the person that's the murderer.\n\n01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.960\nAnd we're not going to acknowledge it audibly.\n\n01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960\nRight.\n\n01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:24.960\nSo it's...\n\n01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.960\nThey're in the bucket.\n\n01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.960\nAnd it's okay that the audience knows.\n\n01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.960\nWe just want to make sure that our...\n\n01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.960\nAsperger detective doesn't know.\n\n01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.960\nOkay.\n\n01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960\nSo the...\n\n01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.960\nYeah.\n\n01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.960\nSo murder has been chosen.\n\n01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.960\nOur show feels so classy now.\n\n01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:40.960\nThank you.\n\n01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:41.960\nBut he was like, wait, wait.\n\n01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:42.960\nDon't tell me.\n\n01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.960\nLike this...\n\n01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.960\nIt's really like...\n\n01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960\nAll right.\n\n01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.960\nA polite applause.\n\n01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.960\nAll right.\n\n01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.960\nOne of us, someone in this room, is a murderer.\n\n01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.960\nWe have to do more games.\n\n01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960\nWhat's the crime?\n\n01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960\nWhat's the crime?\n\n01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.960\nThe crime is there's a baby in a bucket.\n\n01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960\nAll right.\n\n01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.960\nIt's four years old.\n\n01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.960\nIt's been killed and placed in a bucket.\n\n01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.960\nFuck.\n\n01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.960\nThis isn't going to work.\n\n01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.960\nNo, it'll work.\n\n01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.960\nIt'll work.\n\n01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960\nWhat?\n\n01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.960\nWell, we're going to be interrogated.\n\n01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.960\nWell, no.\n\n01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.960\nWell, my theory is we're calling 911, right?\n\n01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.960\nLike we're each calling 911?\n\n01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.960\nSure.\n\n01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.960\nOr is that not...\n\n01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:16.960\nNo, that works.\n\n01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.960\nWhy would three people all call 911?\n\n01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.960\nWe each found a baby in a bucket.\n\n01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.960\nBecause we're trying to get away with it.\n\n01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.960\nTwo of us are the people that found the baby in the bucket.\n\n01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.960\nRight.\n\n01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.960\nWe're just going to kill the baby in the bucket.\n\n01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.960\nOkay.\n\n01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.960\nWhy would that person call 911?\n\n01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.960\nTo smoke screen.\n\n01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.960\nOkay.\n\n01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.960\nRight.\n\n01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.960\nBecause otherwise they'd just leave the baby to be found.\n\n01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:37.960\nOkay, let's just keep it simple.\n\n01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.960\nLet's just try it very simple.\n\n01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.960\nSo a couple more facts.\n\n01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.960\nDo we just want a couple more facts?\n\n01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.960\nOkay, it does work.\n\n01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.960\nAll right.\n\n01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.960\nIs the baby in a bucket?\n\n01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.960\nOne of us did it.\n\n01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.960\nAnd we're all going to call up for various reasons and say, oh Jesus Christ, baby in a bucket.\n\n01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:48.960\nYeah.\n\n01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.960\nI mean, I already know this isn't going to work.\n\n01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.960\nNo, it'll work enough.\n\n01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.960\nNo, but here's the thing.\n\n01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.960\nThe way that he's going to be helpful in this, and we're going to show off Ryan's skill set,\n\n01:06:58.960 --> 01:06:59.960\nis that-\n\n01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:00.960\nHe's going to ask us details.\n\n01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.960\nYeah.\n\n01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.960\nBut we're all going to be making them up.\n\n01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:04.960\nAnd that's why it doesn't work.\n\n01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:05.960\nThat's why it doesn't work.\n\n01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:06.960\nWell, no.\n\n01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.960\nI mean, I think it'll be good.\n\n01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:09.960\nRight.\n\n01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:14.960\nThey're just, we need, let's just say like two kind of facts that are clues that we could kind of all-\n\n01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.960\nI think we need to agree on a redirection of light point.\n\n01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.960\nThat's the thing is we want him to detect where the redirection of light happened.\n\n01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.960\nRight.\n\n01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.960\nLike we actually need to actually, like we need to know that you guys, I don't know.\n\n01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.960\nNo, just a couple.\n\n01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960\nOkay.\n\n01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.960\nSo he's in a bucket.\n\n01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.960\nIt was by the river.\n\n01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.960\nHe was playing, right?\n\n01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.960\nThose are things we've learned.\n\n01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960\nOkay.\n\n01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.960\nSo just establish two more facts.\n\n01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:37.960\nThe baby was wealthy.\n\n01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:38.960\nRight.\n\n01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.960\nOkay.\n\n01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.960\nGreat.\n\n01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:41.960\nHe was an heir to the kingdom of Brunna.\n\n01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:42.960\nOkay.\n\n01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:43.960\nOkay.\n\n01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:44.960\nI think I understand this.\n\n01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:45.960\nAnd I hope he's not listening.\n\n01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.960\nI hope he's not listening, but I, because I need to explain this like loudly and-\n\n01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.960\nGotcha.\n\n01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.960\nLike basically we're all the same person.\n\n01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:52.880\nRight.\n\n01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.880\nBut that makes sense.\n\n01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:54.880\nYeah.\n\n01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:59.360\nAnd so, but like there are two versions of us are innocent.\n\n01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.360\nRight.\n\n01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.000\nAnd one version of us is guilty.\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.880\nSo what we need to decide on is what actually happened.\n\n01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.880\nOkay.\n\n01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.880\nThat's what I was saying.\n\n01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.880\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:08.880\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:09.880\nNo, no, sorry.\n\n01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:10.880\nI'm not trying to-\n\n01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.880\nWell, I don't listen to other people.\n\n01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:12.880\nThat's not-\n\n01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.880\nSusie your pants.\n\n01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.880\nNo, no, it's good.\n\n01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.880\nBut okay.\n\n01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:16.880\nAll right.\n\n01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.880\nI'm glad you were saying that then.\n\n01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.880\nOkay.\n\n01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.880\nAll right.\n\n01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.880\nThe details only-\n\n01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.880\nThe non-murder timeline.\n\n01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.880\nWhy?\n\n01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.880\nHow did the baby end up in the-\n\n01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:28.880\nIf the baby ended up in the bucket and we didn't kill it, here-\n\n01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.880\nOkay.\n\n01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.880\nLet's agree on what happened.\n\n01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.880\nRight.\n\n01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.880\nOr-\n\n01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:38.120\nOr did the two people that didn't kill the baby leave the room, too, and only the\n\n01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.880\nperson that killed the baby knows the actual story-\n\n01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:40.880\nRight.\n\n01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.880\nSo no one actually knows what happened.\n\n01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.880\nSo wait.\n\n01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.880\nIs that too complicated?\n\n01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.880\nNo, no, that's great.\n\n01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.880\nOh, that is good.\n\n01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.880\nSo who killed-\n\n01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.480\nAgain, we're all going to leave the room at one point.\n\n01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.480\nOkay, so what if- what if the coloring book was still in the car?\n\n01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.480\nWait.\n\n01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.480\nWe're just- these are just clues.\n\n01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.480\nDoesn't the-\n\n01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.480\nAren't we supposed to leave-\n\n01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:59.480\nWho- who- wait, I thought- did you-\n\n01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.480\nThese are clues.\n\n01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.480\nThese are-\n\n01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.480\nRight.\n\n01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.480\nNo, no, let's say that's for instance, but that's not going to be the one that we do.\n\n01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.480\nOkay.\n\n01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:06.480\nCan you come back up and point again?\n\n01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.480\nAll right.\n\n01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.480\nHow about this?\n\n01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.480\nChurch.\n\n01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.480\nGive Spencer-\n\n01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.480\nOh, shit.\n\n01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480\nWhat?\n\n01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:18.480\nCome up and give Spencer some clues.\n\n01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.480\nWait.\n\n01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:20.480\nWhy do you give clues?\n\n01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.480\nIt's not-\n\n01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.480\nI know.\n\n01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.480\nThere's going to be details.\n\n01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.480\nThere needs to be- there needs to be one truth for the people that didn't kill the baby,\n\n01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:28.480\nand one- and then the other person needs to be like, making it up.\n\n01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:29.480\nWell, let's just- let's just try it.\n\n01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.480\nLet's just do alibis now.\n\n01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:33.480\nI think we should stick with a coloring book in the car.\n\n01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.480\nOkay.\n\n01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.480\nIf we want one more-\n\n01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.480\nThere's a coloring book in the car.\n\n01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.480\nYeah.\n\n01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.480\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.480\nBut we all know that.\n\n01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.480\nAll right.\n\n01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:41.480\nYes.\n\n01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.480\nOkay.\n\n01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.480\nOkay.\n\n01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.480\nOkay.\n\n01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.480\nOkay.\n\n01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:51.480\nOne more is the car- where does the car park tell about?\n\n01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.480\nBy the river.\n\n01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480\nGreat.\n\n01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.480\nBy the river.\n\n01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.480\nAnd so we're all going to be calling in separately for different reasons.\n\n01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.480\nAnd we're all- two of us because we found a baby in a bucket.\n\n01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.480\nOkay.\n\n01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.480\nAnd one of us because we killed the baby and put it in a bucket.\n\n01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.480\nRight.\n\n01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.480\nThis doesn't work.\n\n01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.480\nAnd does everyone know- does everyone know who killed the baby?\n\n01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.480\nI don't.\n\n01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.480\nWell, you guys don't.\n\n01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.480\nYeah, so can you come back up and point at the person again?\n\n01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.480\nOkay.\n\n01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.480\nAll right.\n\n01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.480\nAll right.\n\n01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:25.480\nSo everyone in the audience, he just pointed at Dan, Jeff, and Spencer.\n\n01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:29.480\nAll of our reason to be a subscriber to the live feed.\n\n01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.480\nYou will know right now who this is.\n\n01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:35.480\nI mean, I'm not saying we're making a mistake.\n\n01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.480\nI just want to get better at this.\n\n01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.480\nOne thing happened that made everything fall apart.\n\n01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.480\nAnd otherwise it was going great.\n\n01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.480\nI don't want to reveal what that thing was.\n\n01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.480\nHopefully you make it through your surgery and I want to retune this and like-\n\n01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.480\nHopefully I die.\n\n01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.480\nI want to do nothing but have-\n\n01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.480\nAnd then we can call 911 about me dying on the operating table.\n\n01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.480\nI don't know what happened.\n\n01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.480\nI found his head in a bucket.\n\n01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:58.480\nI guess his surgery.\n\n01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480\nAll right.\n\n01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480\nOkay.\n\n01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.480\nSo what's the- how do we- how do we go ABC through this now?\n\n01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.480\nSo we want another audience member to pick who should go first then.\n\n01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.480\nI go first.\n\n01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.480\nSomeone just said Jeff.\n\n01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.480\nDid you hear- okay.\n\n01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.480\nDid you hear what happened?\n\n01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.480\nNo.\n\n01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.480\nThat sounds like a low idea.\n\n01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.480\nHe's redirecting like this son of a bitch.\n\n01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.480\nYeah.\n\n01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.480\nHow much did you hear back to anything at all?\n\n01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.480\nNothing.\n\n01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.480\nAll right.\n\n01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.480\nThat's perfect.\n\n01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.480\nI'll tell you Ryan, not a whole lot happened down here.\n\n01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.480\nA lot of confusion.\n\n01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.480\nYeah.\n\n01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.480\nI was actually- no, no.\n\n01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.480\nIt was good.\n\n01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.480\nA lot of that could have happened with you on stage,\n\n01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.480\nbut otherwise it was good.\n\n01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:41.480\nAll right, so the premise is three of us are- we're all going to give you a 911 call about\n\n01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:46.480\na murder that has happened, and then you're going to pick who of us is based on your\n\n01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.480\nown- you can bring us into the questioning room.\n\n01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.480\nYou can do whatever you want.\n\n01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.480\nYour Michael checklists of your own shield.\n\n01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.480\nYou can do whatever you want at here.\n\n01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480\nAll right.\n\n01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.480\nI go first.\n\n01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.480\n911.\n\n01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.480\nHello?\n\n01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:11.480\nThat's already- I mean, I'm saying- who's dispatch?\n\n01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.480\nWho's dispatch?\n\n01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.480\nOh, well, we need somebody.\n\n01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:16.480\nYou've done it.\n\n01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.480\nYou deserve more.\n\n01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.480\nThank you.\n\n01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.480\nCan you be dispatch?\n\n01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.480\nGreat.\n\n01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.480\nThat's the part I knew.\n\n01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.480\nThis is going to be great for everybody.\n\n01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.480\nCan you be 911 dispatch?\n\n01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.480\nAll right.\n\n01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.480\nGenerally, the job entails telling anyone that has an emergency to calm down.\n\n01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.480\nAll right.\n\n01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.480\nI'm aware.\n\n01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.480\nJust hang up on him.\n\n01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.480\nAll right.\n\n01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.480\nJust hang up.\n\n01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.480\nAll right.\n\n01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.480\nSo I dial 911.\n\n01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.480\nI'm dispatcher.\n\n01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.480\nYeah.\n\n01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.480\nYeah.\n\n01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.480\nYeah.\n\n01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.480\nNow you say 911.\n\n01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.480\nWhat did you say?\n\n01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.480\nWhat's your emergency?\n\n01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.480\nYou're the answer.\n\n01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.480\nYeah.\n\n01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.480\nI was waiting for a ring.\n\n01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.480\n911 dispatch.\n\n01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.480\nHi.\n\n01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.480\nMy name is-\n\n01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.480\nSir?\n\n01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.480\nYes?\n\n01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.480\nCalm down, please.\n\n01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.480\nCalm down.\n\n01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.480\nPromoted.\n\n01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:05.480\nI need you to calm down, please calm down.\n\n01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.480\nMy name is Jake Sweetwater.\n\n01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.480\nI live at 145 Mercury Lane.\n\n01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.480\nOkay, sir.\n\n01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.480\nI need to figure out what's going on right now.\n\n01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.480\nI think I've found the remains of a small child.\n\n01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.480\nIt's in the Sweetwater River.\n\n01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.480\nAnd it's not named after me.\n\n01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.480\nStrangely.\n\n01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.480\nSir?\n\n01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.480\nSir?\n\n01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.480\nI mean, my family moved here because we thought it was funny.\n\n01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:35.480\nSo you're acting very suspicious right now.\n\n01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.480\nOkay.\n\n01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.480\nI still don't know about what's going on.\n\n01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.480\nThe remains.\n\n01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.480\nLet's start with the remains.\n\n01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:48.480\nNear my farm by the old well, there seems to be a painter's bucket, which looks like\n\n01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:52.480\nthe remains of a small child and-\n\n01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.480\nIs this your child or just a child?\n\n01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.480\nI don't have a child, sadly.\n\n01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.480\nWell, that should have been one of the factors.\n\n01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.480\nFunny you should ask.\n\n01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.480\nMy wife can't conceive.\n\n01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.480\nBut neither here nor there.\n\n01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.480\nSir, I'm just saying that we should get-\n\n01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.480\nWe're learning.\n\n01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:10.480\nWhatever you guys do at 911, incorporate it.\n\n01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.480\nYou guys should bring down.\n\n01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:17.480\nI'm pretty certain these are young baby remains in a painter's bucket.\n\n01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.480\nOkay.\n\n01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.480\nSir, I need more details.\n\n01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.480\nI gave you my address.\n\n01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.480\nI told you my name.\n\n01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.480\nI'm a single father.\n\n01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.480\nWhen did you find these remains?\n\n01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480\nJust now.\n\n01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.480\nNo, I waited three days to tell you.\n\n01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.480\nWhat were you doing?\n\n01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.480\nI shot the bucket and my wife and I said,\n\n01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.480\nFuck, it's going to Cancun.\n\n01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.480\nAnd then we'll come back.\n\n01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:43.480\nLook, I'm telling you that I found what looks to be some decomposing remains of a small\n\n01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.480\nchild.\n\n01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.480\nAnd the end, here's my name and address.\n\n01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.480\nSir, I need you to calm down.\n\n01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.480\nSir, I need you to calm down.\n\n01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:56.480\nI think your lack of commitment to your job is more criminal than what led to a baby.\n\n01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.480\nHow long dead?\n\n01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.480\nI don't know who am I, the coroner?\n\n01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.480\nI'm not the medical examiner here.\n\n01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.480\nI'm going to figure out who I need to send.\n\n01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.480\nI don't know if I need to send a fire truck.\n\n01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.480\nI would send police.\n\n01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.480\nI would send a medical team.\n\n01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.480\nSir.\n\n01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.480\nYes.\n\n01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.480\nCalm down, please.\n\n01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:12.480\nOkay.\n\n01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.480\nDon't gender specify me.\n\n01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.480\nWhoa.\n\n01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.480\nThat's the cops.\n\n01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:20.480\nWe'll have someone out on the way.\n\n01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.480\nThank you.\n\n01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.480\nWouldn't that be nice?\n\n01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.480\nI got a baby in a bucket over here.\n\n01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.480\nWhere's somebody?\n\n01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.480\nSir, don't move the bucket.\n\n01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.480\nOkay.\n\n01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.480\nI'm not touching the bucket.\n\n01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.480\nI'm just letting you know.\n\n01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.480\nYou don't touch the bucket with the baby.\n\n01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480\nIt's an active crime scene now.\n\n01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.480\nLook, hey man, I watch a lot of TV.\n\n01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.480\nIf you see a baby in a bucket, what am I going to do?\n\n01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.480\nTouch the bucket?\n\n01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.480\nNo, then I'm the guy that put the baby in the bucket.\n\n01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.480\nThere's a lot of things you can do with the baby.\n\n01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.480\nI don't know you, sir.\n\n01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.480\nI think you're overstepping your fucking bailiwick right now.\n\n01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.480\nYou should just get the police down here.\n\n01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.480\nMa'am, drop the bucket.\n\n01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.480\nI'm not a...\n\n01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.480\nI'm not a ma'am.\n\n01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.480\nYeah.\n\n01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.480\nYou says you.\n\n01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.480\nDrop the bucket.\n\n01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.480\nI'm not...\n\n01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.480\nI'm not holding the bucket.\n\n01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.480\nOpen fire.\n\n01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.480\nOpen fire.\n\n01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.480\nHello, Natalie?\n\n01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.480\nNatalie?\n\n01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.480\nYes.\n\n01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:13.480\nCan you find the main frame where everything's recorded?\n\n01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.480\nAnd delete most of it?\n\n01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.480\nGive me a few minutes.\n\n01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480\nNo, I went too far.\n\n01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.480\nI went too far.\n\n01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.480\nDon't affect the cannon.\n\n01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.480\nOkay, so that was my 9-1-1 call to dispatch.\n\n01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.480\nI think next time we do this game.\n\n01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.480\nAll right.\n\n01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.480\nIt's not a good game.\n\n01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.480\nYou matter my hair.\n\n01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.480\nWho goes second?\n\n01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.480\nDan or Spencer?\n\n01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:32.480\nI think next time we might actually nail it.\n\n01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.480\nSpencer.\n\n01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.480\nI'd like to...\n\n01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.480\nThat's what's keeping the gun out of my mouth.\n\n01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.480\nIs that we're making steps.\n\n01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:41.480\nAnd all these members randomly chosen Spencer to go second at the 9-1-1 call.\n\n01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:42.480\nOkay.\n\n01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:47.480\nNow the question is how familiar is Spencer with my 9-1-1 call?\n\n01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:54.780\nSee, that's what we debugged is that we had to establish all common facts about the relationship\n\n01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:56.480\nwith the baby.\n\n01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:57.480\nOkay.\n\n01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:04.480\nBeat, boop, beat, beat, beat, boop, beat, boop, boop, boop, boop.\n\n01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.480\nSir, sir, please stop pressing buttons.\n\n01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.480\nIt's 300 letters.\n\n01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.480\nI just pressed 9-1-1, 9-1-1.\n\n01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.480\nThere's only three numbers, sir.\n\n01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.480\nHi.\n\n01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.480\nMy name's Carl Sweetwater.\n\n01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:19.480\nI live on the Sweetwater Farm next to the Sweetwater River.\n\n01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.480\nI'm so sorry to bother you.\n\n01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:22.480\nI have a situation.\n\n01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.480\nI can't believe it.\n\n01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.480\nI was just babysitting my baby niece, my four-year-old niece down by the river.\n\n01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.480\nWe drove down by the river.\n\n01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.480\nSir, sir, sir, I need you to calm down.\n\n01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.480\nOkay.\n\n01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.480\nDid you happen to have a bucket with you?\n\n01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.480\nHow did you know?\n\n01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:42.480\nLet me let me do some breathing exercises.\n\n01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.480\nOkay.\n\n01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.480\nSo we were playing with sand in the bucket.\n\n01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.480\nOkay.\n\n01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.480\nAnd I went back to my car because they left their coloring book in the car.\n\n01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.480\nOkay.\n\n01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.480\nShe did, not they.\n\n01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:53.480\nOh, okay.\n\n01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:58.480\nAnd so when I when I came back with the coloring book, I just see the kid face down, head in\n\n01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.480\nthe bucket, not breathing.\n\n01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.480\nI tried to resuscitate her.\n\n01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.480\nIt didn't work.\n\n01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.480\nI was too late.\n\n01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.480\nSir, sir, let me ask you this.\n\n01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.480\nIs CPR certified?\n\n01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.480\nNo.\n\n01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.480\nAnd I, but you know, you just panic.\n\n01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.480\nOkay.\n\n01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:15.480\nDo you have any other relatives that you know of that may have been in under the Sweetwater\n\n01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.480\nname?\n\n01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.480\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:24.960\nOwner of the Sweetwater brand of electronic companies.\n\n01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.480\nWhy is that relevant?\n\n01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.400\nCan you send someone?\n\n01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.400\nIt's a slow day.\n\n01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.480\nIt's only me here.\n\n01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.480\nSo I've taken a lot of calls in.\n\n01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.480\nOh, I've been there.\n\n01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:37.400\nI've got I've received a call.\n\n01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.480\nYou may want to check the river.\n\n01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.480\nWell for what?\n\n01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:45.280\nOh boy, I think I got a dead kid.\n\n01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.280\nI'm so.\n\n01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.280\nI just I don't know.\n\n01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.280\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:51.680\nI can't believe I fucked up.\n\n01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.680\nIt was just.\n\n01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.680\nIt was just in a minute.\n\n01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:54.680\nWe will send someone in.\n\n01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.680\nWe will send someone over.\n\n01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.680\nPlease.\n\n01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:59.480\nCan you ask them to not shoot me?\n\n01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:09.480\nSweetwater farm has a history ma'am put the bucket down this bucket in my hands to open\n\n01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:10.480\nfire.\n\n01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.480\nOh no.\n\n01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.480\nAll right.\n\n01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.480\nPut some coke.\n\n01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:17.480\nI can call the chief see that's that's what you were.\n\n01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:21.480\nWhen you were telling the story Jeff, I was like oh well I was going to tell a story about\n\n01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:22.480\nbeing related to this kid.\n\n01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.480\nYou're just finding a dead kid that you never knew about.\n\n01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.480\nSo like that.\n\n01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.680\nAnd for the game that would have been good to establish.\n\n01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:33.480\nShould I have not like mentioned any sort of relation?\n\n01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.480\nYou're doing great.\n\n01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.480\nI know.\n\n01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:39.480\nI think where we are right now is just as confusing as most first first four hours of\n\n01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:40.480\nany investigation.\n\n01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.480\nNo, it's good.\n\n01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.480\nI like it.\n\n01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.480\nIt's not.\n\n01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.480\nAll right.\n\n01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.480\nNow it's Danster.\n\n01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.480\nAll right.\n\n01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.480\nSo now I like this.\n\n01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:48.480\nDan Dan has to call 911.\n\n01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.480\nAll right.\n\n01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.480\nBeep.\n\n01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.480\nBeep.\n\n01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.480\nBeep.\n\n01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.480\nBeep.\n\n01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:54.480\nBeep.\n\n01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:55.480\nBeep.\n\n01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.480\nBeep.\n\n01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.480\nBeep.\n\n01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.480\nThere is just silence in the background.\n\n01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:05.480\nI'm having a hard time hearing you.\n\n01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.480\nOh Fuck.\n\n01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.480\nShit.\n\n01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.480\nHello 911.\n\n01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.480\nSir, yes.\n\n01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.480\nYeah.\n\n01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.480\nOh my god.\n\n01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:12.480\nThere's a baby in a bucket.\n\n01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.480\nOh, okay.\n\n01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.480\nI found a baby in a bucket.\n\n01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:15.480\nOkay.\n\n01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.480\nLet me let me get your all the time it's happened to you tonight.\n\n01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.480\nSir, I needed to calm down.\n\n01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.480\nMy name is my name is Carl suite water.\n\n01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.480\nI'm like I'm.\n\n01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:28.360\nSir, I need you to calm down.\n\n01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.360\nI need you to calm down.\n\n01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.480\nI know you need me to calm down, but the thing is the truth is...\n\n01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.480\nIs this your baby?\n\n01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.480\nGod, no.\n\n01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:37.480\nWhy would I have a baby in a bucket?\n\n01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:40.480\nSir, or maybe ma'am, I don't know you.\n\n01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.480\nThank you.\n\n01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.480\nI'm not familiar or I'm not sure what your pronoun is.\n\n01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.480\nThat's really cool of you.\n\n01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.480\nThank you.\n\n01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:46.480\nYou're welcome.\n\n01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:49.400\nI actually, during college, I actually was...\n\n01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:55.400\nI did go through a phase where I identified as non-binary.\n\n01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.400\nThank you.\n\n01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.400\nThank you.\n\n01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.400\nI just found a baby in a bucket.\n\n01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.400\nI'm a man now.\n\n01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.400\nI'm a book man.\n\n01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:07.400\nI've got to fucking cock the size of a Lincoln log and I'm like ready to rock.\n\n01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.400\nLike I'm through that forest and I don't think that's necessarily...\n\n01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.120\nI don't think that makes me a hero.\n\n01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:19.360\nSo sir, judging by that, that lesson, you identify as a man and this is not your child.\n\n01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.360\nYou're right.\n\n01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.360\nNo, absolutely not.\n\n01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.360\nHow did you find it?\n\n01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360\nNot because of...\n\n01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.360\nI found it in a bucket.\n\n01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.360\nI'm not going to call it that.\n\n01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.360\nMy car broke down.\n\n01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:33.560\nI ran out of radiator cap and it started steaming and I hit a tree and I was like, I'm going\n\n01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.040\nto breath a fresh air.\n\n01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.360\nThink about where my life's gone.\n\n01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.960\nI've changed my gender.\n\n01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.160\nI've changed my field of expertise.\n\n01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.960\nI've gone from video to audio.\n\n01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:51.960\nI used to be a woman that was into HD and then I became a man that was into audio.\n\n01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:57.400\nI was just finding my place so I hit this tree.\n\n01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:02.880\nI'm on a bunch of ketamine and I'm breathing and I see this bucket and I'm like, what's\n\n01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.520\nin there?\n\n01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:05.520\nI see something gleaming.\n\n01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.200\nI'm like, are those teeth?\n\n01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.360\nTurns out, yeah.\n\n01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.120\nI'm like, why are they so...\n\n01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:17.480\nSir, I'd like to let you know this entire call is being recorded.\n\n01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.800\nOh, fuck.\n\n01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.920\nI'm going to prison.\n\n01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.640\nIt's not because I killed my baby.\n\n01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.920\nIt's because of my past and I'm going to make...\n\n01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:26.920\nYou're fine.\n\n01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:27.920\nI'm not fine.\n\n01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:28.920\nAll right.\n\n01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:29.920\nSo we have our 3911 calls.\n\n01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.920\nI'm not fine.\n\n01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.920\nNo, no.\n\n01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:32.920\nDo we all get separately?\n\n01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:33.920\nOh!\n\n01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.920\nPut the bucket down.\n\n01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:41.040\nNo, no cops showed up.\n\n01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:43.400\nNow does Ryan interview us?\n\n01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:51.600\nAlso, I think the murderer might be the night moment dispatcher because the lack of effort\n\n01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:56.960\nput into helping this baby or solving these calls every day just feels like it's just\n\n01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.960\nanother...\n\n01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.400\nIt's old hat to you, but meanwhile, there's three people that have a baby.\n\n01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.400\nIt's not...\n\n01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.400\nYeah, they're all under the Sweetwater name and everyone's very suspicious.\n\n01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:06.200\nI think a major clue is that two of the Sweetwaters were named Carl.\n\n01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.360\nThank you.\n\n01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.200\nBoth of you were Carl Sweetwater.\n\n01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:13.000\nWe should have established the person and all been the same person.\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000\nOh, okay.\n\n01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nIt's fine.\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000\nWe're workshopping.\n\n01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.520\nWe're going to get better at it, but in the meantime, do you think you know who killed\n\n01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.520\nthe baby?\n\n01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.520\nNo.\n\n01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.520\nBut...\n\n01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.520\nYeah.\n\n01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:27.880\nWell, let's see.\n\n01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.400\nPerfect crime.\n\n01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:33.880\nI bet he's analyzing the psychology and it all seems like people are just making a bunch\n\n01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.880\nof shit up.\n\n01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.880\nYeah.\n\n01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:41.160\nWell, Jeff lied about where you contradicted yourself.\n\n01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.320\nYou said you had a child and then you said you didn't.\n\n01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.320\nI did?\n\n01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.320\nYeah.\n\n01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.320\nOh.\n\n01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:50.320\nI was in shock.\n\n01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.320\nVery suspicious.\n\n01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:55.920\nDo you see a baby in a bucket every day?\n\n01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:03.320\nI'm just a gentleman farmer who owns a music electronics company on an eponymous river.\n\n01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:07.360\nBy the way, never get on their email list.\n\n01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.840\nThey will email you forever.\n\n01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:09.840\nYeah.\n\n01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.840\nHey, it's Dale from Sweetwater.\n\n01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:11.840\nHow's your microphone?\n\n01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.840\nMotherfucker.\n\n01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.840\nI love Sweetwater.\n\n01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.880\nI'm sure everyone loves them.\n\n01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:17.880\nThey're great.\n\n01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:18.880\nThey're emails.\n\n01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:23.480\nSo yeah, I think the next question I want to ask is when you left the child next to\n\n01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:27.720\nthe bucket, what was the distance between the bucket and the car?\n\n01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.600\nIn my head, it was about 30 feet, like down the embankment or up the embankment to the\n\n01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.600\ncar.\n\n01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.600\nYeah.\n\n01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.600\nIn your head?\n\n01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:35.600\nYeah.\n\n01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.600\nOh, shit.\n\n01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.880\nWhen I was picturing the fact situation.\n\n01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:38.880\nOkay.\n\n01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:41.440\nAnd how long do you think you were at the car?\n\n01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.240\nLess than a minute, I think, I said.\n\n01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.240\nOkay.\n\n01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.720\nSo was your back turned to the child?\n\n01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.720\nNo.\n\n01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:52.600\nI was turning around to face the child to get into my car and grab the coloring book,\n\n01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.600\nI'd imagine.\n\n01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.960\nOh, there was a coloring book.\n\n01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.600\nYou were turning around to face the child to get in the car?\n\n01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600\nRight.\n\n01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.240\nI was headed towards the river.\n\n01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:10.040\nSo I turned around to enter the car door, you know, I love this.\n\n01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.840\nI love seeing the process.\n\n01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.840\nDoes that make sense?\n\n01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.880\nIt's like, because the car's facing the river.\n\n01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:20.160\nSo then I walk away, I unlock the car and where's the bucket in relation to the car?\n\n01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.880\nIt would be face in the river, right?\n\n01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.680\nSo it would be forward and to my left that way, like that.\n\n01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:29.920\nSo like there, oh God, it feels like a cop is just interviewing me.\n\n01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.080\nSo you walked away from the child toward the car.\n\n01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:37.720\nSo essentially you were not looking at the child when you walked away.\n\n01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:38.720\nRight.\n\n01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:39.720\nOkay.\n\n01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.720\nIn my head.\n\n01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:41.720\nOkay.\n\n01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.160\nWhat did you hear when you walked away?\n\n01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.160\nNothing.\n\n01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.160\nGurgling?\n\n01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:52.200\nSo the kid was playing in the bucket as you walked away?\n\n01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.600\nYeah, it was full of sand.\n\n01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.600\nIt was full of sand?\n\n01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:57.480\nSo what was she doing playing with a bucket of sand next to the river?\n\n01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:01.680\nIt sounds like something you would do at the beach unless the sand was pulled from the\n\n01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:02.680\nriverbed.\n\n01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:03.680\nYeah.\n\n01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.680\nIt was like a sandy kind of riverbank.\n\n01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:05.680\nYeah.\n\n01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:06.680\nIn my head.\n\n01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:07.680\nOkay.\n\n01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:08.680\nAnd why were you there in the first place?\n\n01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.680\nWe were playing.\n\n01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.680\nYou two were just playing?\n\n01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:11.680\nWhat?\n\n01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:15.000\nJust having a good time, the river.\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.880\nSo you were there when it was a baby and a bucket?\n\n01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:18.880\nYeah.\n\n01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:19.880\nOh, okay.\n\n01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.960\nYeah, I took the knees down to play.\n\n01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:22.960\nOh.\n\n01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.280\nNow, I would love to interrogate you, but the only thing I heard is you had a huge\n\n01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.280\ncock.\n\n01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:29.280\nI think.\n\n01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.280\nYeah, no.\n\n01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.280\nWell, the size of a Lincoln Log.\n\n01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.280\nA Lincoln Log's huge.\n\n01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:33.280\nI was scared as soon as you said it.\n\n01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.280\nI think.\n\n01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.280\nI think.\n\n01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.280\nThe size of the Lincoln Log.\n\n01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.280\nLincoln Logs are huge when you're a little child.\n\n01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:39.280\nThe long ones are pretty long.\n\n01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.280\nHow big a Lincoln Log.\n\n01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.280\nI think you're thinking they're a lot bigger than they are.\n\n01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.280\nThere's three major sizes of Lincoln Logs.\n\n01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.280\nThey can get pretty big.\n\n01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.280\nYeah.\n\n01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.280\nDid they still make Lincoln Logs?\n\n01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.280\nThey do.\n\n01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.280\nBut they're plastic now.\n\n01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.280\nThey used to be wood.\n\n01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.280\nYou got a splinter up your fucking finger now.\n\n01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.280\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.280\nAll right.\n\n01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:57.280\nSo who did it?\n\n01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.280\nOh, final answer.\n\n01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:59.280\nI have to guess here.\n\n01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.280\nI guess.\n\n01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.280\nIt might be the 911 operator.\n\n01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.280\nHe actually did say he did say it's been a slow day.\n\n01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.280\nI've had a lot of calls.\n\n01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.280\nSo, yeah.\n\n01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.280\nAll because we're.\n\n01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:11.280\nI don't know if he's actually the 911.\n\n01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.280\nEstablishing alibi.\n\n01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.280\nRight.\n\n01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.280\nHe might have murdered the 911 operator.\n\n01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:18.280\nAnd now he's just holding the phone.\n\n01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.280\nFreak up.\n\n01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.280\nGood.\n\n01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.280\nHappy.\n\n01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.280\nLet's see.\n\n01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:23.280\nSo.\n\n01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.280\nHmm.\n\n01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.280\nYeah.\n\n01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.280\nIt wasn't Gregory because he was between the suffering.\n\n01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:34.280\nSome sort of emotional trauma from relationship in me or.\n\n01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.280\nOkay.\n\n01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.280\nYou're looking right at your soulful eyes.\n\n01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.280\nYou're looking right at me.\n\n01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280\nI'm just like, oh, shit.\n\n01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.280\nFor the listeners.\n\n01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.280\nRyan has soulful eyes.\n\n01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.280\nI didn't expect this.\n\n01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:47.280\nAbout the fact that my family, but my wife and I can't conceive a child.\n\n01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:48.280\nYeah.\n\n01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.280\nSo there was there something else to that as well?\n\n01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.280\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.280\nShe's as far as the issues.\n\n01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:57.280\nI wonder, am I being detained right now?\n\n01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.280\nDo you want to be?\n\n01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.280\nOh, I like where this is headed.\n\n01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.280\nI am the MacArthur Park handjobber.\n\n01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.280\nNo, I mean, no.\n\n01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.280\nI might as well tell everybody here.\n\n01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.280\nI'm happy to cooperate with law enforcement all the way on this.\n\n01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.280\nI'm just a person that's found a dead child in a bucket.\n\n01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.280\nHow much are you willing to cooperate?\n\n01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.280\nWho the fuck?\n\n01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.280\nWhy are we on conference call with 911?\n\n01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.280\nYou never hung up.\n\n01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.280\nShe never hung up.\n\n01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:25.280\nYeah, you just got shot.\n\n01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.280\nWhat was your question?\n\n01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.280\nYeah, my last question would be, what were you doing in that location?\n\n01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.280\nI, again.\n\n01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.280\nDo you live nearby?\n\n01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.280\nI live nearby.\n\n01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.280\nI think you said the bucket was near a well?\n\n01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.280\nYeah, it's the old well on Tweetwater River.\n\n01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.280\nOkay.\n\n01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.280\nYes.\n\n01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.280\nNot related.\n\n01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.280\nWere you going to the well to get a bucket of water?\n\n01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.280\nMy wife doesn't like when I smoke in the house, so I take walks up and down the river.\n\n01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:53.280\nAnd I just take a general walk, you ask any of our neighbors, they'll see me kind of patrolling that part of the river just to have my,\n\n01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.280\njust kind of clear my head and have a cigarette or two.\n\n01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.280\nAnd yes, yeah.\n\n01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.280\nDo I smoke a little CBD?\n\n01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.280\nYes, I fucking do.\n\n01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.280\nAnd if that's your thing.\n\n01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.280\nAll right.\n\n01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.280\nIt doesn't give you high.\n\n01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:09.280\nI have sleep apnea, bro.\n\n01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.280\nYeah.\n\n01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.280\nMr. Tweetwater, right out, bro.\n\n01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.280\nThat's pretty rad.\n\n01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.280\nThank you, 911.\n\n01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.280\nSo.\n\n01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:19.280\nAnd did I come across a bucket?\n\n01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.280\nYes.\n\n01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.280\nDid I call 911 to alert the authorities?\n\n01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.280\nShould buckets have babies in them?\n\n01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.280\nNo.\n\n01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.280\nYes.\n\n01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.280\nIs that my fault?\n\n01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:33.280\nIs that some shit that I should be suing for if I run across it when I'm high?\n\n01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:39.280\nOkay, so what we're actually missing here is the identity of the baby.\n\n01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.280\nAnd so that for the setup, that actually requires me.\n\n01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.280\nIt's Gus Johnson.\n\n01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:49.280\nAnd where does Gus live in relation to the river?\n\n01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.280\nGus lives in Shorewood.\n\n01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.280\nWhere's the river?\n\n01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.280\nNext town over.\n\n01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.280\nShorewood.\n\n01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.280\nNext town over.\n\n01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.280\nYeah.\n\n01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.280\nNo relation to the sweetwaters?\n\n01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.280\nNo, no.\n\n01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.280\nNo, no.\n\n01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.280\nRandom baby.\n\n01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.280\nYeah.\n\n01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.280\nAll the family called in, but random baby.\n\n01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.280\nIn the place where it's like sweetwater dense.\n\n01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.280\nSo he died twice.\n\n01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:09.280\nHe died once over here.\n\n01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:10.280\nDon't we all die twice?\n\n01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:13.280\nWe all die a million tiny deaths every day.\n\n01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.280\nIsn't birth just kind of death, but reverse?\n\n01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:17.280\nHis name is Gus Johnson.\n\n01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:19.280\nHe's from Shorewood.\n\n01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:21.280\nHe's a decent son.\n\n01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:25.280\nI mean, we should, we got to get out of this so that we can, like...\n\n01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:26.280\nYou want me to discuss?\n\n01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:29.280\nWell, if you have any last questions for Dan, but otherwise, yeah, probably.\n\n01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.280\nBut...\n\n01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.280\nI did like the, like seeing the process right there.\n\n01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.280\nBut know that those questions are only going to result in bad improv.\n\n01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.280\nIt's not really going to, like, lead you to a new answer.\n\n01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.280\nI would just need to know if there was a relationship of any kind.\n\n01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:42.280\nNo, but it was revealing to watch the way his mind works about what kind of questions he asks.\n\n01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.280\nAgain, I think he has a future...\n\n01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:45.280\nI liked it.\n\n01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.280\nHe deserves better.\n\n01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:47.280\nI will say that.\n\n01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.280\nRight.\n\n01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.280\nHe deserves an actual...\n\n01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.280\nOh, I like to watch his mind work.\n\n01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.280\nI wish he was on a better podcast.\n\n01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.280\nLike, I wish...\n\n01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:57.280\nRyan, would you be happier if we actually killed somebody and had made you have to figure it out?\n\n01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.280\nThat would be amazing, yes.\n\n01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.280\nRight.\n\n01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:05.280\nHow much of a part of, before you make your decision, like when you're leaving your corporate gig\n\n01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:11.280\nto become a, a podcaster about true crime, are you sublimating your own kind of secret fantasies\n\n01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:16.280\nabout either being on either side of that, like it be law enforcement side or being on the criminal side?\n\n01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:25.280\nHow much of our addiction to true crime stuff is our own kind of secret sublimated fantasies about murder?\n\n01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:30.280\nOh, I think it plays a great part, especially in the male mind, that's for sure.\n\n01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:33.280\nYou know, yeah, I mean, I think everybody has that potential for darkness.\n\n01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:36.280\nA lot of times you just hear about these people who suddenly snap.\n\n01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:38.280\nI mean, obviously they're having issues prior to that.\n\n01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:44.280\nBut I mean, when you hear about someone who's living a normal everyday life and then suddenly they just go off the deep end in one moment\n\n01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:46.280\nand just kill a bunch of people.\n\n01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:51.280\nYeah, it's definitely difficult to reconcile that against what we see in everyday life.\n\n01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:57.280\nYes, I mean, I think we talked about this before, but like, women love true crime because they all...\n\n01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.280\nThey're the ones that are going to get murdered.\n\n01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.280\nLike, women have to worry about men killing them.\n\n01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:04.280\nAnd so, like, we...\n\n01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:07.280\nSomeone said thanks a lot for that.\n\n01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:08.280\nThanks a lot.\n\n01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.280\nI'm glad I'm here to tell you.\n\n01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.280\nI was like, well, he's not...\n\n01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.280\nDon't kill the messenger.\n\n01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.280\nThe messenger's one of many people that might kill you.\n\n01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:18.280\nAnd yet the MacArthur Park hand-yabber runs free.\n\n01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:26.280\nIt would be the height of political incorrectness to say anything otherwise.\n\n01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:30.280\nLike, now, women don't get killed anymore than men.\n\n01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:34.280\nIs there one where you're like, what the fuck?\n\n01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:38.280\nI've gotten A, I don't have a B, and I have a murdered body.\n\n01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:39.280\nHow the fuck...\n\n01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:42.280\nI just don't understand how this all links together.\n\n01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:48.280\nYou know, I think with murders, it's not generally not like that too often, but definitely with disappearances.\n\n01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:51.280\nLike, one we were talking about the other night was Brian Schaefer.\n\n01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:52.280\nI'm sure everybody knows that case.\n\n01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:53.280\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:56.280\nI mean, these names kind of, like, they sound like nothing.\n\n01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:00.280\nBut then, I guess you notice when you said a name before, and then you said,\n\n01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:04.280\nthe girl that texted her boyfriend until he killed himself, everyone was like, ugh.\n\n01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:11.280\nBut Brian Schaefer is the guy that went to the bar that was like the big tuna, Lutuna, Saluna, whatever.\n\n01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:14.280\nLike, he was like a guy that got out of medical school.\n\n01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:16.280\nHe went up an escalator into a bar.\n\n01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:18.280\nHe was finishing medical school.\n\n01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:21.280\nHe was going to go on a vacation with his girlfriend.\n\n01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:29.280\nHe completely fucking disappeared from a weird strip mall bar in the middle of Columbus, Ohio.\n\n01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.280\nNever seen again.\n\n01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.280\nYeah.\n\n01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:37.280\nHe never, like, there's security camera footage of him going up the escalator to this bar where,\n\n01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.280\nand then he goes in and then there's security camera footage of like matching the timeline.\n\n01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.280\nAnd then at some point, he just disappears.\n\n01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.280\nIt's not a murder.\n\n01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:47.280\nIt's nothing.\n\n01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.280\nIt just disappears.\n\n01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:49.280\nYeah, no altercation.\n\n01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:50.280\nNo body.\n\n01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:51.280\nHe was engaged to be married.\n\n01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.280\nThere was no strife.\n\n01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:56.280\nThere was nothing like his poor fiance.\n\n01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:04.280\nI think you avoid identifying with her because you're like, I can't live in that nightmare.\n\n01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.280\nThe guy just vanished.\n\n01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.280\nAnyways, but we were talking about that.\n\n01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:10.280\nLike, people obsess about that because it's...\n\n01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.280\nHave you done that episode?\n\n01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:13.280\nYeah, I did cover that one, actually.\n\n01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.280\nOh, cool.\n\n01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:17.280\nYeah, I mean, I think that's one of the ones or one of the very few episodes where I don't\n\n01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.280\nreally have a definitive answer as to what happened to him.\n\n01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.280\nAnd it's really mysterious.\n\n01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:23.280\nYou don't see him leave the building.\n\n01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:28.280\nYou don't have a motive for why he left a different way than he came in.\n\n01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:30.280\nThere's no evidence that he died there.\n\n01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:31.280\nRight.\n\n01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:36.280\nI kind of think that what that one is is like, it's a rare...\n\n01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:42.280\nWe talked about this where we're like, if you can get him out of that bar without a camera\n\n01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:47.280\nseeing him, which is the actual height of the mystery for people, that's why Reddit is obsessed\n\n01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:53.280\nwith this case, is because they love to watch security camera footage and love to look\n\n01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.280\nat Google Earth footage of the...\n\n01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:01.280\nI mean, I was doing it while I'm listening to the true crime garage.\n\n01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.280\nThose guys are from Ohio, so I'm like...\n\n01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.280\nAnd they're like talking about this place.\n\n01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:11.280\nI'm like, on Google Earth, looking at the strip mall in 3D, going like, where did he go?\n\n01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:18.280\nBut if you think about this building tonight as like, oh, if one of you disappeared tonight\n\n01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:23.280\nand one of you will, they're conceivably like...\n\n01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:25.280\nIt could become a famous thing.\n\n01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:29.280\nIt's like one of you disappears and it's like kind of like, if a camera picked up all of\n\n01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:37.280\nyou entering and it was like one of you disappeared, the headline of it would become...\n\n01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:42.280\nThere were cameras everywhere, we know everyone that went in and we don't know where they went.\n\n01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:47.280\nIt's like, yeah, there's a couple ways to get out of this building without a camera picking up on you.\n\n01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:48.280\nOh, yeah, sure.\n\n01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.280\nAnd it is weird.\n\n01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:54.280\nIt would be weird if one of you got out of this building without a camera seeing you,\n\n01:35:54.280 --> 01:36:00.280\nsad or uplifting you pick, but it would be weird if one of you could get out of here\n\n01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:05.280\nwithout a camera knowing where you went, but if you just take a flyer on that weirdness\n\n01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:13.280\nand then add to that the crazy kind of random horrible death of like, he was looking for Coke,\n\n01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:16.280\nlike you and I kind of over dinner decided.\n\n01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.280\nOh, definitely, yeah.\n\n01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.280\nI mean, I've been that guy.\n\n01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:25.280\nI remember being in my 20s and wandering around the Cheetah Club and going like,\n\n01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.280\nhey, man, no, no, no, no, no, Coke.\n\n01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:34.280\nAnd I'm like, I wake up that next morning, I'm like, I'm so lucky to be alive.\n\n01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:40.280\nAll right, I shared too much, but I'm kind of like the next murder mystery.\n\n01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:47.280\nBut I do think it's like, okay, so like, like, all right, Harmon, nail your showdown.\n\n01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:52.280\nI want to talk, I do want to talk about actually like, let's talk about the fact that like,\n\n01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:56.280\nthe personal side of you, that sounds corny.\n\n01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:04.280\nYou wander into these spring or final thoughts, because you're dealing with sociopathic things,\n\n01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:08.280\nyou're dealing with the ghoulish thing, and then you'll, like, so why did she,\n\n01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.280\nwhy did she stab her children to death?\n\n01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.280\nI'll tell you why, redirection of light.\n\n01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:21.280\nBut you'll kind of like, just at the point where we would think you're going to leave us,\n\n01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:29.280\nlike you, you do play the role of like a nice nurturing uncle or father or something where you're like,\n\n01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.280\nand here's the thing, it's okay though.\n\n01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:35.280\nShe's in prison now, and here's why she did that.\n\n01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.280\nShe just wanted to be famous.\n\n01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.280\nAnd why wouldn't you want to want that if you were a sociopath and you didn't have any things,\n\n01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:51.280\nand you'll, you'll slide into not only these like crazy kind of Bukowski prose pieces,\n\n01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:57.280\nthat I, like Spencer has, Spencer and I have agreed, like, man, you could, you could do like a highlight clip of these.\n\n01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:04.280\nI think Cody, who got your app and was like, wait, this motherfucker's doing spoken word,\n\n01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:09.280\nlike I didn't know about that, where like, you actually do like rhyming shit,\n\n01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.280\nbut that's that in the cat in the hat.\n\n01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:21.280\nAnd I don't think you, you, you, but the more important thing is that you, yeah, you kind of go there just when we're feeling left.\n\n01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:27.280\nOur attraction to true crime, I think is an attraction to like, we're like, oh man, does everything die?\n\n01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:33.280\nI don't think, I don't think we're rooting for death when we, when we're attracted to that stuff.\n\n01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:40.280\nI think we're rooting for life when we're attracted to that stuff, and I think that you are responding to that stuff.\n\n01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:49.280\nTalk about how you decide to end your episodes with these weird spoken word riffs or where you go.\n\n01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:54.280\nLike you, you have this like thing about like, we're all going to be AI one day and it doesn't matter.\n\n01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:56.280\nShould I ask a better question?\n\n01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:58.280\nNo, I mean, it's, it's a good question.\n\n01:38:58.280 --> 01:38:59.280\nGood, you're welcome.\n\n01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.280\nNo, you know, I mean, I've always.\n\n01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:02.280\nJesus.\n\n01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:06.280\nWould it kill you to compliment Dan once in a while?\n\n01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:07.280\nJust say it.\n\n01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:10.280\nHow long do I have to talk before you say it's a great question?\n\n01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.280\nA guy asked you an 18 minute question.\n\n01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.280\nSay thank you.\n\n01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:18.280\nI mean, you're supposed to, you're supposed to stop me six minutes through and go, what a great question.\n\n01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.280\nLet me take it from here.\n\n01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.280\nI'm sorry about that.\n\n01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.280\nI'm also sorry about all of that.\n\n01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.280\nGo ahead.\n\n01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.280\nI did it.\n\n01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:26.280\nWhat was the question again?\n\n01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:27.280\nCan you talk about?\n\n01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:31.280\nDon't make him say it again.\n\n01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:32.280\nYeah.\n\n01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:33.280\nWhat inspires your larger takeaways?\n\n01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:34.280\nLike your thematic things.\n\n01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:36.280\nAnd you sometimes say like, because here's the thing.\n\n01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.280\nI've also been in a dark place.\n\n01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:41.280\nSo I know there's a way out, you know, like, how do you connect to that?\n\n01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:48.280\nI think for me, it was like, you know, anytime I've been in a dark place in my adult life, my writing was always the place where I went.\n\n01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:54.280\nAnd, you know, podcasting is a little different for me because I have to get in front of a microphone and I'm, you know, I'm talking and editing.\n\n01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.280\nAnd it's very strange for me.\n\n01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:03.280\nSo I've always relied on the writing and I think I've always embedded so much of my humanity in my writing.\n\n01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:08.280\nAnd it's really an important thing for me to connect with other people on a human level.\n\n01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:12.280\nYou know, I know we can't all agree about everything in society, but, you know, we are all human.\n\n01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.280\nAnd that's just something I very strongly believe in.\n\n01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:25.280\nAnd because of the way my brain structured and it works, you know, I just have that evolutionary function going on that allows me to see humanity as a whole.\n\n01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:30.280\nAnd to care about everybody collectively more so than individually.\n\n01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:41.280\nYour message to those people, though, is often kind of that it's sort of simultaneously nihilistic and uplifting in that you're kind of reaching out to people that give a shit and saying to them,\n\n01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:44.280\nthere's no point in caring about any of this.\n\n01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.280\nWhy?\n\n01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:47.280\nBecause one day we're all going to be robots.\n\n01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.280\nThat's kind of your religion.\n\n01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:55.280\nYeah, I mean, essentially, we're all walking off a cliff right now. I mean, we're all going to die and we eventually will become an artificial intelligence.\n\n01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:00.280\nBut, you know, in the meantime, when we walk off that cliff, I just want to see people fly.\n\n01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.280\nI mean, that's just what I'm about.\n\n01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:13.280\nBut it feels like your advocating part when I listen to you talking to these things, you're sort of like, you know, these meat bodies that we occupy, they're bringing out the worst and the worst people.\n\n01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:14.280\nDefinitely.\n\n01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:36.280\nLike, I found your Columbine episode, like, your take on it was, it wasn't unique, but it was unique in, like, how you focused on, like, you're like, these kids were so already recognized for being nerds that when they started doing these horrible things to everyone,\n\n01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:59.280\nhorribly, like, the first kids that reacted to them were, whether they hated those kids and wanted to bully them or whether they were on their side, but, like, the kids' reaction, their instinctive reaction was to flock toward these kids because they assumed that they were making a movie.\n\n01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.280\nYeah, they assumed they were making a film and it's so sad.\n\n01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:07.280\nLike, these fucking assholes, you didn't call them assholes, but you'd be okay if you did.\n\n01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:24.280\nBasically, like, these fucking dorks, like, how could they not realize how close they were to, like, the fucking people you're shooting, their first reaction to getting shot was, what are you doing, a movie, nerd?\n\n01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:32.280\nIt's like, make a movie, nerd! Like, they could have done it and they didn't understand that they could have done it. Why didn't they understand?\n\n01:42:32.280 --> 01:43:01.280\nLike, I like those takes out of it where you're like, you're not solving the desk, you're not coming up with a new person to blame, but you are, and I do want to say that, like, Spencer, when Cody and I started listening to you and I was sort of like, God damn it, Spencer, I really want you to know, I really want to know what Spencer thinks of you, and not to embarrass Spencer, but, you know, like, you have been an inspiration, you know, to, like,\n\n01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:06.280\nlike, there's a cult leader kind of thing to you.\n\n01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.280\nHe cut off his beard for you.\n\n01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.280\nYou give these almost sermons.\n\n01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.280\nActually, it's partially true.\n\n01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:16.280\nAnd Spencer has said, like, oh, yeah, I was listening to ASPD and, like, fucking ASPD.\n\n01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:28.280\nYeah, well, it's like, because what Dan said is there's something nihilistic about what you say, because it's like, here's the thing, we're all going to die, but, like, that really struck home to me is, like, the past is never going to change and your demons are always going to follow you,\n\n01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:33.280\nso, like, the quicker you come to terms with that fact, the quicker you can adapt to it and learn and grow from it.\n\n01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:39.280\nAnd that was like, holy shit, I have also been tortured by my demons forever, and it's also felt like it's never going to end.\n\n01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.280\nAnd I guess it won't.\n\n01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:45.280\nThat's very freeing to realize that and just go, okay, I better come to terms with that.\n\n01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:46.280\nThat's the water I'm living in.\n\n01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:49.280\nI'm going to drown unless I learn to swim, so I'm going to learn to swim.\n\n01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:56.280\nAnd I just think, like, you have takeaways like that that are, that are crushingly depressing, but at the same time, it's like, well, this kind of seems realistic.\n\n01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:00.280\nSo it doesn't, it's not like, it's not bullying or it's not nihilistic.\n\n01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:04.280\nIt's just like, it's just a sobering revelation about the way of things.\n\n01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.280\nAnd I think at your best, you're doing a lot of stuff like that.\n\n01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:10.280\nThat doesn't really give you a place to respond.\n\n01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:11.280\nSo thank you for doing it.\n\n01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:12.280\nYeah, thank you.\n\n01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:15.280\nWe don't give our guests a place to respond.\n\n01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:16.280\nI got a question.\n\n01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:18.280\nWe don't even let them talk.\n\n01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:19.280\nIt's great.\n\n01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:24.280\nIs there anything that you said that you kind of don't stand by like that?\n\n01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:27.280\nBecause you don't want a lot of reaction.\n\n01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:34.280\nWell, yeah, I mean, I will say there is an episode where you said like you claim someone made up a name and you said it was a three part name,\n\n01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:36.280\nRomero T Rogers or something like that.\n\n01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:38.280\nAnd I was like, what's the logic there?\n\n01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:41.280\nLike, oh, that was probably in one of the Amityville horror episodes.\n\n01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:42.280\nRight.\n\n01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:43.280\nI think so.\n\n01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.280\nYeah, there was definitely logic, but I would have to go back and listen to that.\n\n01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.280\nOh, okay.\n\n01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.280\nSo many episodes instead.\n\n01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:50.280\nIs there anything that you're like on second thought or you probably don't look back.\n\n01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:56.280\nWhat about the episode where you were like, if America had been made great again, this murder wouldn't have happened.\n\n01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:06.280\nI thought, I'd see that it was kind of like before the election, you were, would you like to rescind that?\n\n01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:10.280\nOh, man, I had a, I had a Lyft driver in the way here, boy.\n\n01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:16.280\nHe had some some Trumpy talk radio going on and he just, he just kind of just started wanting to talk about stuff.\n\n01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:20.280\nAnd I was trying to make it very clear that I wasn't in a conversational mood with this guy.\n\n01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.280\nHe's, yeah, I just like listening to talk radio.\n\n01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:25.280\nThis is not the fake news.\n\n01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.280\nThis is real news.\n\n01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.280\nI'm like, okay.\n\n01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:28.280\nAll right, cool.\n\n01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:29.280\nHey, where are you going?\n\n01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.280\nI'm going to this place.\n\n01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:31.280\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:32.280\nThere's a place near there.\n\n01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:33.280\nThey got those cute waitresses.\n\n01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.280\nThey're going to get you something.\n\n01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:35.280\nMr. Ram.\n\n01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:37.280\nI don't want an old guy bringing me.\n\n01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:41.280\nHey, let's shut the fuck up.\n\n01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:42.280\nCivil war.\n\n01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.280\nWe're all going to die.\n\n01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:44.280\nAll right.\n\n01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:45.280\nBut in the meantime.\n\n01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:50.280\nIs there anything you want to correct or do you just, do you just like let him fly and keep going to the next one?\n\n01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:53.280\nNo, I mean, I think there were some early episodes that I did.\n\n01:45:53.280 --> 01:46:00.280\nMaybe I wanted to keep the first 10 episodes I did somewhat normal and then just get crazier as it went along.\n\n01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:01.280\nAnd I've definitely done that.\n\n01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:04.280\nYou know, I've lost some fans in the process and gained a lot more.\n\n01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:06.280\nSo it's a really interesting thing.\n\n01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:08.280\nWhat if you run out of murders?\n\n01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:09.280\nHave you been conscious?\n\n01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:10.280\nWe'll just create more.\n\n01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.280\nDo you do?\n\n01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.280\nHow do you be honest?\n\n01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:13.280\nHow do you keep an eye on that?\n\n01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:16.280\nWhen you say you lost some fans, like, are you, what numbers are you looking at?\n\n01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:24.280\nAnd don't, and please be honest because like, like, like, like, what are you, what did you look at when you got like, I lost some fans.\n\n01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.280\nOh, no, I don't mean in terms of, you know, like mass quantity or anything.\n\n01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:35.280\nBut there are people who have listened to my show have contacted me and said, you know, now that you're talking more about artificial intelligence or talking about the brain.\n\n01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.280\nAre you talking about the future?\n\n01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:38.280\nIt's kind of turning me off.\n\n01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:43.280\nBut then at the same time, there are a lot more people who are saying, Hey, I really interested in this.\n\n01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.280\nSo how do you parse that?\n\n01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:52.280\nAre you going by the guiding light of the more people that praise me the better?\n\n01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:54.280\nOr are you?\n\n01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:56.280\nNo, it's just always authenticity.\n\n01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:59.280\nI do exactly what I think will be most authentic to me.\n\n01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.280\nAnd I think that people will connect with that the most.\n\n01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:03.280\nI'm gonna be polarizing no matter what.\n\n01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.280\nI miss when you used to play D&D on the show.\n\n01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:07.280\nI thought that was really good.\n\n01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:09.280\nI actually hated those segments.\n\n01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:10.280\nI'm glad they're over.\n\n01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:15.280\nThat's what I find inspiring about you is because it reminds me of a day when I was able to understand that.\n\n01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:21.280\nLike when you say stuff, you go like, by the way, and I know what I'm about to say is going to make half of you hate me.\n\n01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:24.280\nBut here's why you're going to hate me because you're stupid.\n\n01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:29.280\nAnd I mean, you know, you don't say that specifically, but it's kind of like, it hits that chord for me.\n\n01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.280\nAnd I'm like, yeah, motherfucker, sex pistols, fuck the Beatles.\n\n01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:37.280\nLike, stop trying to, people, please, harm it. It fucking ruined you.\n\n01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:39.280\nUm, anyways.\n\n01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:46.280\nHas there been one that made you like, or not even one, but has like doing this over a period of time made you like kind of change things in your life?\n\n01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:49.280\nOr like, I got to look over my shoulder a little bit more, watch out for this person.\n\n01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:56.280\nUm, you know, there are, there are occasionally times I get contacted by a family member of a victim or something like that.\n\n01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:00.280\nAnd it could be a very positive interaction or it could be negative.\n\n01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:02.280\nYou know, it just depends.\n\n01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:08.280\nHave there been, so, so talk, we'll talk about a positive one where somebody's like, hey, I'm related to so and so.\n\n01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:11.280\nThank you so much for doing the piece on that true crime thing.\n\n01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:14.280\nBecause I imagine that's how it starts is the cheese and the trap.\n\n01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:22.280\nYeah, I mean, I think for me, I don't get contacted as much as perhaps other people do about that because of the nature of my show.\n\n01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:28.280\nI, you know, I think there are things that people like.\n\n01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:33.280\nMaybe the victims families will like that I say, and then there are other things that will be a little offensive.\n\n01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:38.280\nI tend to come off a little bit insensitive sometimes because I'm just, you know, going off on a rant.\n\n01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:40.280\nI think all the time, yeah.\n\n01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.280\nYeah, pretty much.\n\n01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:47.280\nI would like rely on you to be insensitive would be the reason why I would come to you.\n\n01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.280\nI feel like, well, he's going to be insensitive.\n\n01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:55.280\nYeah, but I think, you know, the thing about me is that I mean sensitive in pursuit of the truth.\n\n01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:57.280\nYeah, and that part of the truth is that you love humanity.\n\n01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:58.280\nYeah.\n\n01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:00.280\nAnd so that just feeds right into that authenticity.\n\n01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:02.280\nAnd so I'm not afraid to be like that.\n\n01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:06.280\nIt's just, I think that I should just put myself out there and.\n\n01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:15.280\nAnd so you decided, even though you're a fan of true crime, so you knew there was a sea of people out there that were like, well, there's people out there who interview victims and things like that.\n\n01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:17.280\nAnd you're like, do you pick the path?\n\n01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:19.280\nYou're like, well, I know myself.\n\n01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:24.280\nI should probably just brush this plaque, like go forward through this path.\n\n01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:32.280\nIt's not going to do me any good or anybody any good for me to be the sensitive to the victims, survivors, accused, whatever.\n\n01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.280\nLike, did you have that thought process?\n\n01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:39.280\nYou know, I did, but I think it's just so natural for me to be authentic in what I'm saying.\n\n01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:45.280\nLike listening to a lot of other true crime shows, I mean, you know, they do a great job of factually presenting the case.\n\n01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.280\nAnd then sometimes when it comes to a point where you need to give opinions, they back off.\n\n01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:52.280\nAnd then sometimes that's where they end the show.\n\n01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:56.280\nAnd so I always want to do something different, but like I said, authentic to myself.\n\n01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:59.280\nSo I think that's the direction I went.\n\n01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:09.280\nDo you want to just talk about your, I feel like your podcast has kind of a grand, unifying theory about like how evolution is building towards this humanity endgame.\n\n01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:12.280\nDo you want to maybe, so is that too quick to summarize?\n\n01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.280\nBut I think that's like really interesting.\n\n01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:21.280\nAnd that kind of drives a lot of like where your tangents go and like what evolution means to us on a societal level or I don't know.\n\n01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:24.280\nYeah, so I mean, so I see life in two separate contexts.\n\n01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:27.280\nOne would be social and the other one is evolutionary.\n\n01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:37.280\nAnd so the social context is where, you know, we live together every day and we create new technology by arguing back and forth and pushing forward.\n\n01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:44.280\nLike for instance, in politics, you have Republicans and Democrats, you need that conflict in the absence of conflict, you're not going to get changed.\n\n01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:53.280\nAnd so the way evolution generally works is that it creates society as a manipulation of its needs.\n\n01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:58.280\nAnd so what it needs us to do is grow up as humans and move out of the house, so to speak.\n\n01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:09.280\nAnd so the way we're going to surpass evolution or transcend evolution essentially is that we will just continue to create technology until we have replaced, we've replaced the human brain.\n\n01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:15.280\nAnd once we've replaced the human brain, the entire operating system, the body, then we no longer have a connection to nature.\n\n01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:18.280\nAnd without a connection to nature, we'll have a data-based operating system.\n\n01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:23.280\nAnd by doing that, we actually have autonomy that we never did before.\n\n01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:26.280\nWithout the connection to nature, we don't reproduce, we replicate.\n\n01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:28.280\nAnd so evolution...\n\n01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:30.280\nWhich might merger won't be necessary.\n\n01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:32.280\nYeah, and so, yeah, exact.\n\n01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:44.280\nSo the stage I call, when we transcend evolution, I call that stage metamorphosis, where we will actually just be able to change at a very quick pace at any time, do whatever we want essentially.\n\n01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:47.280\nIt will be the greatest period of autonomy the world has ever known.\n\n01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:49.280\nI feel like you can't wait for it.\n\n01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:50.280\nI listened to the podcast.\n\n01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:51.280\nYeah, I'm so excited.\n\n01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:57.280\nI guess that's part of why when I met you, I expected you to weigh 400 pounds more than you did.\n\n01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:01.280\nAnd I know that's going to offend a lot of people, maybe even you.\n\n01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:06.280\nBut it was because I really did picture you as a guy who was like a ticking fucking guy.\n\n01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:09.280\nI was like, one day we're going to be robots.\n\n01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:12.280\nAnd I was like, God damn, this guy can't wait for us to be robots.\n\n01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:13.280\nI wonder why.\n\n01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:18.280\nAnd I was like, I expected to see the reason when I walked into the restaurant.\n\n01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:26.280\nI didn't expect you to look like a guy that could beat me up, because that guy should be like, one day we'll be robots, but fuck you until then, fuck you.\n\n01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:28.280\nI can bench 300.\n\n01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:31.280\nYou definitely can't wait.\n\n01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:33.280\nYou want us to be AI.\n\n01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.280\nThat's the rapture to you, right?\n\n01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:36.280\nOh, absolutely.\n\n01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.280\nYeah, it's going to be a much better future.\n\n01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:41.280\nDo you think how do you want to make a call?\n\n01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:44.280\nLike seven years, 17 years?\n\n01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:46.280\nOh, no, it's going to be quite a long time for sure.\n\n01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:47.280\nI mean, the technology.\n\n01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:49.280\nYour lifetime?\n\n01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:51.280\nNo, I mean, I think.\n\n01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:54.280\nWe're talking way down the line.\n\n01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:57.280\nGenerally, the way that's going to work.\n\n01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:01.280\nLike I said, society is the manipulation of evolution.\n\n01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:13.280\nSo basically, society will only have an acceptance of becoming artificial intelligence as we move closer to actually having the technology to do it.\n\n01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:22.280\nRight now, we're still making movies that are 3,000 years in the future where there are human beings in deep space and it's absolutely ridiculous.\n\n01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:24.280\nYou made an amazing answer.\n\n01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:34.280\nYou made the observation like, right now, we have a president who is saying in response to planes going down, there should be less planes and there should be more coal power.\n\n01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:52.280\nAnd like, you kind of looked at it like, again, not to put words in your mouth, but corrective or wrong, you're sort of like, it's like, we evolve at a certain rate and we sort of have this built-in stop mechanism where it's like, if there's so many of us that are so shitty at evolving,\n\n01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:56.280\nthen we're going to like, there's going to be this rubber break and evolution.\n\n01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:08.280\nWe're going to go, it's like, which is kind of comforting because it's like, oh, yeah, there's never going to be this judgment day, Terminator style, where it's like, oh, the robots are here.\n\n01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:09.280\nThey're shooting you.\n\n01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:11.280\nNo, they'll take us over long before that.\n\n01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:12.280\nWell, we're going to become them.\n\n01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:21.280\nAnd until we're ready to become them, which includes your mom on Facebook and everybody, like, well, until everyone's ready, it's not going to move forward that fast.\n\n01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:27.280\nAnd that's the squeaking sound of the elevator going like, you're trying to get to floor three.\n\n01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:31.280\nBut then again, there's breaks because, hey, we don't want.\n\n01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:34.280\nAnd so that's all it is in the grander scheme.\n\n01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:35.280\nWe're just going to become robots.\n\n01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.280\nWho the fuck cares?\n\n01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:43.280\nYeah, I mean, you're seeing the most primitive technology right now, as far as that goes, like the internet is the first collective human intellect.\n\n01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:48.280\nAnd it's just really interesting because we're building something that's going to be database.\n\n01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:52.280\nBut at the same time right now, we don't have that technology in our bodies.\n\n01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:55.280\nAnd so we're running the internet on emotion.\n\n01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:58.280\nAnd you go on the internet and you can see everybody is enraged.\n\n01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:00.280\nIt's just absolutely ridiculous.\n\n01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:10.280\nI guess the thing that I don't understand about you that would make you then a genius been that you don't think the way I understand some should think is that you see that bigger picture.\n\n01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:18.280\nMost people that see the bigger picture, you should be writing novels about Uranus merged with Neptune and all that stuff.\n\n01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:21.280\nYou shouldn't have a true crime podcast.\n\n01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:23.280\nYou're like, we're all going to become robots.\n\n01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:27.280\nEvery one of your episodes is like, so that's the JonBenét Ramsey murder.\n\n01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:33.280\nBut here's the thing, they shouldn't feel ashamed of themselves because one day we're all going to be robots.\n\n01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:36.280\nAnd it doesn't really equate.\n\n01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:40.280\nIt's like pick a lane and that's what I like about it.\n\n01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:52.280\nIt's great. It's like the only true crime podcast that's like therapeutic and also like super futurism and also like you're literally solving cold cases, which is like no podcast does any of those.\n\n01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:54.280\nBut the solution to every cold case ever is take it easy.\n\n01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:56.280\nWe're all going to be robots.\n\n01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:59.280\nSometimes it's just realize you're going to die.\n\n01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:06.280\nDo you have a comment on that? Then I'd be a good interviewer.\n\n01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:08.280\nIf you don't, then I'm a bad interviewer.\n\n01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:10.280\nRight.\n\n01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:13.280\nJust the idea that you bridge those two worlds.\n\n01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:17.280\nYeah, I mean, I think I've always been like that as a writer.\n\n01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:25.280\nI've always tried to incorporate a lot of different elements to my detriment a lot of times in commercial pursuits.\n\n01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:33.280\nBut in terms of artistic viability, just creating something that means something to people.\n\n01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:37.280\nI never really think about like you're saying staying in one lane.\n\n01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:46.280\nSomething I say all the time is I go off the rails sometimes when I'm writing and I could just switch subjects and just start talking about something entirely different.\n\n01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:49.280\nAnd I don't know. It just seems like people appreciate it.\n\n01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:51.280\nWell, the answer doesn't satisfy me at all.\n\n01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:53.280\nYeah.\n\n01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:55.280\nTrue crime is a really specific genre.\n\n01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:57.280\nYou have to be so into it to do these episodes.\n\n01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:12.280\nYeah, well, I think the correlation between the future and true crime for me and why I love it so much is that all of these cases that we're looking at, it's all leading to advanced technology related to detection.\n\n01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:20.280\nAnd so, I mean, if you look at the difference in technology today as opposed to 100 years ago, just in the context of law enforcement, it's just phenomenal.\n\n01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:29.280\nI mean, the changes have been unbelievable. So with the continuation of that over the years, we will continually create more technology related to detection.\n\n01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:34.280\nAlright, Ryan, which one of us killed the baby in the bucket?\n\n01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:42.280\nWithout more information about the victim, I would have to say that it was probably you.\n\n01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:46.280\nNot only did I do it, but I said I did it earlier.\n\n01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:48.280\nCliff Hanger!\n\n01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:51.280\nThank you, everybody, for coming to Harmontown.\n\n01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:53.280\nThank you, Gregory.\n\n01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:55.280\nThank you.\n\n01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:58.280\nThe 9-1-1 hostess was the mostest.\n\n01:57:58.280 --> 01:57:59.280\nThank you.\n\n01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.280\nThank you, Greg.\n\n01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:03.280\nLet's give it up for our guest, Ryan Kraus, everybody.\n\n01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:05.280\nCold Case Murder Mysteries.\n\n01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:06.280\nCold Case Murder Mysteries.\n\n01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.280\nFrom the PsychoCast and the Sociocast.\n\n01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:10.280\nSpencer Crittenden.\n\n01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:11.280\nI'm Jeff Davis, your comptroller.\n\n01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:13.280\nYour mayor, of course, is Dan Harmon.\n\n01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:16.280\nThank you all for coming down. Drive fast and take chances.\n\n01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:19.280\nLet's all fly up those cliffs, we're all gonna die!\n\n01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:39.280\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:46.280\nIt's a good show!\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[191084]}
