WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.480
Hello check one two two how's it going gang

00:15.480 --> 00:33.320
Hello gang from MacArthur Park near downtown Los Angeles MacArthur Park

00:33.320 --> 00:37.840
we're just melting in the dark and I'll never have a recipe again if no one knows

00:37.840 --> 00:43.920
what I'm talking about go and listen to the Richard Harris version of MacArthur

00:43.920 --> 00:49.080
Park song written by Jimmy Webb it is the fucking weirdest song in the world

00:49.080 --> 00:53.880
and it's about old dudes playing Chinese checkers across the street but I digress

00:53.880 --> 01:01.880
Harmontown is now in session let's bring out Spencer Crittenden everybody

01:01.880 --> 01:16.960
what's good Spencer I don't know man I know I know it's kind of good sometimes

01:16.960 --> 01:29.520
great our mayor mr. Dan Harmon yeah I know I can recognize less applause than

01:29.520 --> 01:35.240
for Spencer I know what it sounds like I'm happy to see him too I also felt like

01:35.240 --> 01:39.680
I got less applause not that I deserve who I don't know I get the last applause I

01:39.680 --> 01:45.120
guess my fault I gave lackluster intro so I'm glad you brought that up I'm glad

01:45.120 --> 01:48.720
to hear you say it because if I ever accused you of doing it I'd be the

01:48.720 --> 01:52.960
biggest dick in the world but I don't want to taper I think you handicap your

01:52.960 --> 01:56.480
intro I don't want to make the audience try again that seems rude yeah I know

01:56.480 --> 02:00.520
that then they're like oh so the shit's on all the way down to us where we were

02:00.520 --> 02:05.000
at now we're at SeaWorld come on I can't hear you this is a dying whale

02:05.000 --> 02:10.880
pretend it's not dying just let leave them alone let them be in the splash

02:10.880 --> 02:14.920
zone of comfort I wasn't trying to hit like to kneecap your I don't know it's

02:14.920 --> 02:19.480
good I actually made the mistake of thinking that if I just really laid it

02:19.480 --> 02:24.240
down subtly that there would be kind of a weird like I've never thought that you

02:24.240 --> 02:28.760
were doing anything to deliberately yeah I I miss you and I love you it's good

02:28.760 --> 02:31.320
to see you it's good to see you and I missed you I missed both of you how's

02:31.320 --> 02:34.560
things what have I missed I don't know I mean we only ever see each other the

02:34.560 --> 02:39.680
three of us up here it's true let's talk about Spencer's beard I got it yeah

02:39.680 --> 02:43.240
oh yeah oh shit I was gonna ask you if you'd lost weight but just your hair

02:43.240 --> 02:48.640
lost weight I lost like 30 pounds did you keep it for like like the Smithsonian

02:48.640 --> 02:56.220
or anything I kept it for wizard spells it looks good you look you look like a

02:56.220 --> 03:02.600
very successful almond brother thanks that's what I was going for he's the

03:02.600 --> 03:07.600
least talented all my brother he's the one that booked all their gigs he's got

03:07.600 --> 03:12.320
all the publishing right oh Tiki almond put up all the flyers where they was

03:12.320 --> 03:20.720
20. Guys, come on, Greg, Tyler, Tyler. I don't even know the Almond Brothers. I don't

03:20.720 --> 03:24.920
know either. I know one's named Greg. Name one more Almond Brothers than Greg and you

03:24.920 --> 03:30.760
want a toaster, but you're the one that played tambourine and booked the gigs. That's good.

03:30.760 --> 03:35.880
That sounds like me. That's a very big compliment when it comes to self care. Oh, because the

03:35.880 --> 03:42.000
other almonds are like who cares? I'd rather die. You know that. That's part of your your

03:42.000 --> 03:46.800
limited knowledge of the Almond Brothers because I'm at zero. I really don't know. I'm projecting

03:46.800 --> 03:51.760
it sounds like they play music. Yeah, they play music. Okay, and their brothers. That's

03:51.760 --> 03:58.160
interesting. I mean, it's not talk about your tomorrow. I'm getting surgered. Yeah, you're

03:58.160 --> 04:04.240
going in for surgery. Yeah, yeah. I was feeling okay about it until the anesthesia cyst called

04:04.240 --> 04:08.840
me and it was like you're going to be in pain, but we're hoping to get you from a sharp

04:08.840 --> 04:13.840
stabbing ripping pain to a dole throbbing pain. I was like Jesus Christ during the surgery

04:13.840 --> 04:18.440
or well it wasn't specific. And so yeah, I don't know. And then I remembered my roommate

04:18.440 --> 04:23.040
was like oh yeah. The last time I got surgery, they said you woke up and we're crying out

04:23.040 --> 04:27.680
in pain, but she didn't remember it and I'm like I don't. I guess it's a little better

04:27.680 --> 04:32.480
to not remember it, but it still seems terrible to go through. What are you getting surgered?

04:32.480 --> 04:37.160
What am I getting surgered? My hip, my left hip, which is great because lately my right

04:37.160 --> 04:42.680
hip has been hurting. So yeah, what is it? Is it bone shearing kind of stuff or what's

04:42.680 --> 04:50.280
going on? I got let's see femoral acid tabular impingement, which means you know the I've

04:50.280 --> 04:54.440
it's a great story. I've told it a lot of times that you know that hip is a ball and

04:54.440 --> 05:01.320
socket joint Jeff and the ball is not shaped right. It's got too much ball going on and

05:01.320 --> 05:04.720
so they're going to get rid of some of the ball and then hopefully it's not going to

05:04.720 --> 05:08.880
pop out. Well pop out is too violent. It kind of it kind of gets strained. You know like

05:08.880 --> 05:12.960
when you have an action figure and you kind of pull his arm too much back and it comes

05:12.960 --> 05:17.720
a little bit out of the joint, but it's not popped out. That happens and when that happens,

05:17.720 --> 05:23.280
it grinds the soft tissues, not unlike a meat grinder slamming your door into a car into

05:23.280 --> 05:27.800
a slamming your hand into a door. What causes identical to what Cody? Yeah, she has it on

05:27.800 --> 05:31.640
the other end, right? The she has the socket rather than the ball, right? Something like

05:31.640 --> 05:37.040
that. Yeah, something's misshapen. So the mortar and the pestle are just grinding cartilage.

05:37.040 --> 05:41.840
Yeah. So she tried. I know it's fucked up, but we're all dying. Yeah. But it's better

05:41.840 --> 05:46.200
that we just fucking deal with it. It actually uplifts us like allegedly like we're melting.

05:46.200 --> 05:49.760
We're dying. You know what you got to get? You got to get that CBD. Yeah.

05:49.760 --> 05:59.680
Tonight's episode is brought to you by Charlotte's Web CBD oils. Just throw a little CBD on

05:59.680 --> 06:04.520
that. We can't tell you why because it's not legal to do so, but do it. What are they

06:04.520 --> 06:08.560
cutting open? They're going to my understanding is they're going to they're going to make

06:08.560 --> 06:14.480
a slight incision on the hip pump the opening full of saline such to separate the muscle

06:14.480 --> 06:21.120
fibers without slicing them apart and then going through the gaps, not unlike a submarine

06:21.120 --> 06:27.480
traversing the barrier reef. Is that something submarines reverse? They'll get in there.

06:27.480 --> 06:31.000
They'll grind down. They'll suck out the bones. They'll take all the shredded suck

06:31.000 --> 06:39.120
out the bones. I'm not. I'm now. I hate the bones. Suck out the bones. I like Henry Jones

06:39.120 --> 06:42.920
because Henry Jones don't eat no meat. Don't suck out the bones. Don't suck out the bones.

06:42.920 --> 06:47.720
Don't suck. That's you taking a Hippocratic oath to not suck out bone. You suck them out

06:47.720 --> 06:50.760
like like like they're actually like going to jack them out. Well, they're going to

06:50.760 --> 06:54.600
get a Dremel in there. They're going to grind away at the bones and then that'll that'll

06:54.600 --> 06:58.680
leave not sawdust, but bone dust. If you're if you're in a Tony Romo's if you're in a

06:58.680 --> 07:03.400
Tony Romo's rib joint, suck out the bones. You're a doctor. Suck on the bone. Suck.

07:03.400 --> 07:08.480
Suck out the marrow. You can suck out the bones. You can suck out the bones. But if

07:08.480 --> 07:13.320
you cook the rib for long enough, you could suck the bones right out. So your socket,

07:13.320 --> 07:19.280
your socket is what my socket's great. My ball is too big. It's oval. It's interesting

07:19.280 --> 07:23.960
to me that there's a distinct that they draw a distinction because my fiance apparently

07:23.960 --> 07:28.640
has the opposite, but it sounds identical, right? Because if the ball and socket aren't

07:28.640 --> 07:35.200
working together, how do you know which is to blame? Well, x-rays. You could just see.

07:35.200 --> 07:39.160
But you could you could fix the problem by changing either, right? They're either working

07:39.160 --> 07:43.800
together or they're not. Yeah, but I mean, it's yeah, you could probably,

07:43.800 --> 07:47.960
but you'd be, you know, there's extra bone somewhere. So you want to take out the extra

07:47.960 --> 07:52.160
bone. You could take out the normal bone to make way for the extra bone, but that's probably

07:52.160 --> 07:57.360
degrading the structural integrity of the bone. I'm sure it is. There's an ideal. Yeah. What

07:57.360 --> 08:02.240
am I doing? I want these people to go to eight years of school. Right. I don't want to know

08:02.240 --> 08:05.360
more than them. Are you going to live in that world?

08:05.360 --> 08:11.960
General anesthesia for this? Yeah, I'm hoping to die. It's weird because they always say

08:11.960 --> 08:15.760
there's like a chance if you go under, you won't come up. But like, if there is that

08:15.760 --> 08:19.760
good of a chance, I don't think they do that. You know, I said, and I asked you, you've

08:19.760 --> 08:25.440
been under before. Yeah, my wisdom teeth. I got a butt thing. How many how many people

08:25.440 --> 08:29.600
here? Let's put it. Let's put a pin in your but thing. Right? That's what they did. Have

08:29.600 --> 08:35.440
been absolutely under for a medical procedure. Okay, that's good that you're all alive.

08:35.440 --> 08:41.080
Huh? The whole whole entire fucking audience. Yeah, it's I think wisdom teeth is a pretty

08:41.080 --> 08:45.920
common one. You generally go on. I don't want to high road you guys. You definitely go under,

08:45.920 --> 08:51.040
but I've had scoppies. I don't know if your tooth procedures count. I think that's what

08:51.040 --> 08:57.880
no, but but I the thing I haven't gone through a couple of scoppies like endo. That's what

08:57.880 --> 09:04.200
I'm getting. And I had like a they put a slit. They did a biopsy thing. They had to get some

09:04.200 --> 09:11.120
shit out of there. So twice now I've been put under. Right. And I've come to realize

09:11.120 --> 09:16.960
that because I remember and I've talked about this on a show before, but the first time

09:16.960 --> 09:21.000
is the anesthesial just came to me and said, do you have any questions? And I said, will

09:21.000 --> 09:25.160
I dream? And she said, nope. Nope. And it was such a fast answer. And I was like, what

09:25.160 --> 09:29.720
the fuck is with the fast answer? Like, like, they know that subjective shouldn't shouldn't

09:29.720 --> 09:34.280
it be like, well, it depends on your religion. Well, I have some answers for that. There's

09:34.280 --> 09:38.600
different kinds of sleep. And when I when I smoked a lot of weed, I stopped dreaming.

09:38.600 --> 09:43.360
And apparently when there's drugs like like the what do you call it? What's the night

09:43.360 --> 09:48.600
the sleeping drug that everyone takes CBD bro? No, not melatonin. It's like the butterfly

09:48.600 --> 09:55.760
Netflix lunesta. Let's say yeah Netflix. It's one of those that's where you have a potato

09:55.760 --> 10:06.640
chip and poop. Oh, no, that's a lester. Oh, okay. It's just become the dad hour. But

10:06.640 --> 10:10.360
there's those drugs that put you to sleep. They help you sleep in whatever. And those

10:10.360 --> 10:14.320
apparently aren't good because they put you do bad sleep and you don't get rest out of

10:14.320 --> 10:17.960
it. You kind of need to go into deep sleep and then go into REM sleep to actually repair

10:17.960 --> 10:22.560
your brain or remove brain plaques or whatever good sleep is doing for you. But when you're

10:22.560 --> 10:25.880
taking drugs that make you not dream and stuff, it doesn't give you that kind of sleep. It's

10:25.880 --> 10:29.680
a different kind of sleep. You're just like unconscious or whatever. And it's not that's

10:29.680 --> 10:33.600
not good. You want to have good sleep. So it's they are inducing that kind of sleep.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.920
They're inducing good sleep. They're inducing bad sleep. So you're not dreaming. And that's

10:36.920 --> 10:44.800
why they have such a firm answer. Okay. Well, okay. Well, so, but the good sleep, bad sleep.

10:44.800 --> 10:49.320
I mean, good sleep is because you're still alive. Bad sleep is you're the equivalent

10:49.320 --> 10:54.240
of dead. Like, like, like that was very comforting to me the second time I did a procedure where

10:54.240 --> 10:59.360
they put me under. And then I came back and I was like, what the fuck? What in the why

10:59.360 --> 11:04.520
am I dressed like this? Oh, they cut you up. And I think and then I'm like driving home.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.640
I'm like, can't wait to get a drink. Can't wait to get back. You're not supposed to drive

11:07.640 --> 11:10.480
yourself home after that, by the way. Yeah, somebody else is supposed to drive. That's

11:10.480 --> 11:14.720
like the rule. I'm like in the Uber and I'm like, take me to the drawing room and the

11:14.720 --> 11:19.280
guys like you're not supposed to drink after I'm like, take me before my fuck before this

11:19.280 --> 11:26.280
fades away. I want to combine it with everything on the top shelf. And part of it is because

11:26.280 --> 11:38.640
it's like there is to me, I do feel like I feared death 10 to 30% more before I had had

11:38.640 --> 11:43.640
these experiences where they go, we're going to do this thing, we got to work on your throat

11:43.640 --> 11:47.040
and we don't want you to sue us. So we're going to put you in a state where you're never

11:47.040 --> 11:51.960
going to sue us. Right. And the state where you're never going to sue anybody is kind

11:51.960 --> 11:58.480
of death. They figured out how to put you in a state that just makes you not exist.

11:58.480 --> 12:03.000
It doesn't make you dream. It doesn't make anything that your fiancee would say to you,

12:03.000 --> 12:08.920
make you go like, yeah, but they don't want that during surgery. So you're being put by

12:08.920 --> 12:14.880
corporate America into a state called death. And then they're bringing you back out of

12:14.880 --> 12:20.680
death. So while that's not necessarily a good power for them to have, it is like, it is

12:20.680 --> 12:26.260
comforting for me when I think about it ago, like, yeah, oh God, what if, what if God doesn't

12:26.260 --> 12:30.720
exist? I'm like, motherfucker, you know what happens if God doesn't exist. It's called,

12:30.720 --> 12:38.280
it's called everything that led up to that surgery minus all the shit that happened after.

12:38.280 --> 12:43.440
That's it. That ain't so bad. Right. That's what I'm afraid of, though. That that to me,

12:43.440 --> 12:47.360
that is so bad. You know what I found? It's so bad in a philosophical sense. Well, you've

12:47.360 --> 12:52.360
done a lot. You've done a lot. I'm just like, it's not, it's not Vietnam. It's like, it's

12:52.360 --> 12:57.360
not like, well, it's like, whatever happens before you go into that state, it's like,

12:57.360 --> 13:02.760
ah, Tommy, I can't feel my legs. No, it's all right. Remember the Bronx pizza? Oh, shit,

13:02.760 --> 13:08.040
put my intestines. Like that's all life. That's life. That's not death. There's nothing to

13:08.040 --> 13:13.960
fear about death. The story of like, of like a famous, like his famous, like a hiker who

13:13.960 --> 13:17.800
wrote this thing. And he would, he would go in these giant, like, like mountain hiking

13:17.800 --> 13:22.400
trips, and he would bring one long novel to read. And every page he read, he would tear

13:22.400 --> 13:27.080
the page off to lighten the weight of what he, you know, like what he's carrying as he

13:27.080 --> 13:30.720
goes along. So he's reading his book. And he's like, why, why have the rest of the pages

13:30.720 --> 13:34.160
behind you that you're not going to read again? Like, you just see, we just tear the pages

13:34.160 --> 13:36.080
and throw them away as he was he hiked along.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.640
Because he's like the last shit I'm ever going to read. I don't give a shit.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.560
Yeah, it's like, I'd rather carry a light book and like, like everything before me is

13:42.560 --> 13:45.800
the first page of the book that I'm reading and everything else has already happened.

13:45.800 --> 13:50.240
And did anyone, I mean, everyone right now is going like, what the, how in the fuck are

13:50.240 --> 13:57.480
you littering at this time? Like, just because you're there and there's like no cops, you're

13:57.480 --> 14:02.120
just like fucking, like I, yeah, I bring a bag of French fries. I do the same thing.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.400
I like throw a fucking McNugget wrapper.

14:05.400 --> 14:14.040
He is papers by her degradable. I just think the one one man's poet is another man's

14:14.040 --> 14:18.880
head. I mean, look, the first thing I thought to is like litterbug. What are you doing?

14:18.880 --> 14:23.320
Like, like, like, do you want to like, what if other people 20 years from now want to

14:23.320 --> 14:26.800
be the guy that's never been here before? And they're like, what is this shit? There's

14:26.800 --> 14:32.520
a hustler pages everywhere. That's a pictorial about a waitress being in a guy's mouth.

14:32.520 --> 14:38.560
Why did he take, eat, love, pray? Bring something fucking heavy.

14:38.560 --> 14:44.520
Skinny legs and all. Tim Robbins just wishes he was Kurt Vonnegut. Tom Robbins, sorry.

14:44.520 --> 14:48.120
You know what scared me? That didn't scare me. It kind of alarmed me after the fact when

14:48.120 --> 14:53.640
I had my vocal surgery. It was, I was under, I was up at like an hour and a half later.

14:53.640 --> 14:58.400
Everything was fine. Everything was groovy. They told me I was in a wheelchair so that

14:58.400 --> 15:02.680
like church could drive me home. I had to be come out in a wheelchair. I was, I stood

15:02.680 --> 15:06.800
up. I was fine. Like, you good to walk? I'm like, yeah, I'm fine. And I didn't realize

15:06.800 --> 15:13.520
that they had drawn and with a sharpie, an X on the side of my neck. I'm like, what is

15:13.520 --> 15:17.000
that about? And they go, Oh, that was just to make sure the doctors know what side to

15:17.000 --> 15:21.960
cut into right because otherwise they're so good at their job that they'll just fuck

15:21.960 --> 15:27.080
right up. We trust them to kill us and bring us back to life, but they don't know what

15:27.080 --> 15:31.120
side to be putting a, they're going to be putting a camera and a laser beam down my

15:31.120 --> 15:34.800
throat and they want to make sure that laser beaming the right side of my neck. But it

15:34.800 --> 15:39.080
was just a good old fashioned X marks the spot on the outsides. They goes, Oh, we're

15:39.080 --> 15:43.640
doing left side today. That's that's like, that's like, that's a little too analog for

15:43.640 --> 15:47.200
my fucking ball. I'll, I'll, I've said it before I'll say it again.

15:47.200 --> 15:52.520
And the socket doctors are serial killers with support systems. That's their privileged

15:52.520 --> 16:01.400
serial killers. I like a Jeffrey Dahmer might have been a head chief of staff, but he grew

16:01.400 --> 16:08.760
up in Milwaukee. God bless him. He was just trying to make AI. Speaking of which podcast

16:08.760 --> 16:14.160
I read it. Yeah. I asked somebody I was I was in Milwaukee like four or five days ago

16:14.160 --> 16:17.400
and I asked somebody like, you guys have the most serial killers. They go, no, that's Washington.

16:17.400 --> 16:21.360
I'm like, they're proud of that. That's like a weird Australia. Like you guys have so many

16:21.360 --> 16:25.800
poison spiders. So like 30% of our spiders aren't poisonous. Like no one's supposed to

16:25.800 --> 16:31.000
know that you're not supposed to have that reaction. All right. Anyways, let's let's

16:31.000 --> 16:37.400
let's get to our guest. We can talk to him about all this and more. I've I've I've it's

16:37.400 --> 16:41.320
a complicated relationship because I'm like, I'm like in this new age of like everyone's

16:41.320 --> 16:46.520
I can touch people. I can, I can hurt them. I can judge them. I can like it's that I can

16:46.520 --> 16:51.280
be a fan. I can like whatever. I don't know. And I'm in the true crime podcast. We we flew

16:51.280 --> 16:57.880
the red handed ladies out from from from London. And we're it was a blessing. And we've had

16:57.880 --> 17:02.440
a good time. And then I'm like, like in the I don't know, I talk about the shit I listened

17:02.440 --> 17:06.840
to on podcasts. And I'm like, Oh, I've been talking about this guy, Asperger detective.

17:06.840 --> 17:10.400
And then I'm like, you heard me go through in this podcast where I'm like, well, I probably

17:10.400 --> 17:15.480
shouldn't call him that. That's got that seems like bullying. Because if you like like the

17:15.480 --> 17:21.520
guy in the meantime, we've become fans and all this stuff like this. Anyways, he's here.

17:21.520 --> 17:31.560
And he's amazing. Please welcome Ryan Krauss from from Cold Case mystery murders.

17:31.560 --> 17:45.960
I didn't even get that right. Cold Case mystery files. Cold Case murder mysteries. Cold Case

17:45.960 --> 17:49.280
mystery. Cold Case murder mysteries. Cold Case. Hello, Ryan. How you doing, man? I definitely

17:49.280 --> 17:55.680
nobody expected you to look like Michael chick list. That's not. And that's the biggest compliment

17:55.680 --> 17:59.760
in the world. I told you last night we had dinner. I'm like, like, Michael chick list

17:59.760 --> 18:06.320
is everyone's catch offer. You shave your head and work out. I would have said he looks

18:06.320 --> 18:13.760
more like that one judge that you really want to impress on a cooking show. Anyway, it's

18:13.760 --> 18:16.760
rude to bring you out. I think your favorite profile is here, but you got to use a little

18:16.760 --> 18:20.920
more salt in this, man. You got to. Anyway, sorry, how are you? How was your trip? Thank

18:20.920 --> 18:28.240
you for driving out here. Oh, I'm great. Yeah. Yeah, you drove here from Phoenix. Yeah.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.400
Yeah, unfortunately. Yeah, you're going to you're going to have to eat that Mike. We

18:31.400 --> 18:35.920
have to tell everyone. Yeah, it's the worst like this. I'm so close. You're going to

18:35.920 --> 18:40.000
be this close. Okay. Otherwise, people will be like, I hated him. In my mouth. I hate

18:40.000 --> 18:44.200
you. No more far away guess. Why was that guy so far away? And we're like, he wasn't

18:44.200 --> 18:48.760
far away. You're a Phoenix native for residents. No, I just moved away from LA actually about

18:48.760 --> 18:54.400
six months ago, unfortunately. But so you fled LA and you've moved to Arizona. Yeah,

18:54.400 --> 18:58.920
I was like, I had a corporate job and the podcast and I could only really keep one. So I had

18:58.920 --> 19:03.480
to let something go and I was in Santa Monica. So I let go of the corporate job. And yeah,

19:03.480 --> 19:10.520
I just had to do my thing. I do love I love those stories like when you get into true

19:10.520 --> 19:15.600
crime podcasts, you're like invested in people that have a certain amount of Patreon subscribers

19:15.600 --> 19:22.800
and then hopefully usually there's like a moment where they're like, guys, if enough

19:22.800 --> 19:27.200
of you help me, I can actually stop delivering pizza or whatever. And you kind of like you

19:27.200 --> 19:31.720
experience this sort of like you get to watch a million Stan Lee's like create a million

19:31.720 --> 19:37.400
Spider-Man's kind of, but it's like it's a healthy in a healthy level. So I and I heard

19:37.400 --> 19:41.680
that episode where you're like, you're telling your origin story of working in cubicles

19:41.680 --> 19:47.400
and stuff. And it was it was pretty, pretty deep and electric. It's really I is more than

19:47.400 --> 19:51.520
I expected. Yeah, I don't even know if I remember that there's an underlying thing to you. We

19:51.520 --> 19:56.360
should talk about this later though, because we should like where you you you kind of God

19:56.360 --> 20:03.880
dinner or I mean great. Thank you, Steve. I just don't understand why it can't happen

20:03.880 --> 20:10.960
earlier. I'll tell you why because I didn't text him yet. Oh, you texted. I had to say

20:10.960 --> 20:14.560
he keeps dropping the ball. He keeps dropping the ball day before your surgery and you're

20:14.560 --> 20:18.440
in charge of ice. Well, I got to be in charge of ice going forward. It's going to be a big

20:18.440 --> 20:28.760
part of my life for a couple weeks. That's just true. Anyways, so let's talk. Let's talk.

20:28.760 --> 20:34.960
Can we talk about your origin story? Like you going from working stiff to true crime

20:34.960 --> 20:40.200
podcaster? Okay. Yeah, let's do that. Which part of we want to talk about? I don't know.

20:40.200 --> 20:44.840
Like give us the rough edges. You don't have to I heard an episode where you talk about

20:44.840 --> 20:49.040
it. There was like a there was like a whole thing. You don't have to talk. Is that the

20:49.040 --> 20:54.440
Columbine episode or was the one before it? I think that was a free episode. Yeah, could

20:54.440 --> 20:59.720
have been but but but just give us the I don't know. Like you see you. Why are you interested

20:59.720 --> 21:04.400
in true crime? Why did you start a true crime podcast? That kind of thing. I got a bad interviewer

21:04.400 --> 21:09.160
just help me out in the true crime thing started way back in the day. I mean, my mom was watching

21:09.160 --> 21:13.480
unsolved mysteries all the time. I don't know if anybody's a fan of unsolved mysteries with

21:13.480 --> 21:17.760
her like constantly. So I was always just in the house and I would hear about true crime

21:17.760 --> 21:21.760
and he's unsolved things and I just started becoming interested in that. And I think for

21:21.760 --> 21:26.040
me it was like, Oh, how did these people's brains work? Why did these people kill being

21:26.040 --> 21:30.160
sociopaths like criminals? Yeah, I mean, it was I wanted to know about everybody's brain

21:30.160 --> 21:34.960
and why is this person a psychopath or a sociopath? Do you think what do you think is isolating

21:34.960 --> 21:41.280
that like what is it fear? Like is it fascination when we want because I think it's linked to

21:41.280 --> 21:47.800
why we watch movies about mafia people, werewolves, like like we we have this fascination. Oh,

21:47.800 --> 21:53.840
these people are sociopaths. Is it is it like I'm scared. Werewolves just get bit.

21:53.840 --> 21:59.720
Is it is it I'm scared I'm like them or is it I'm so scared of them I need to understand

21:59.720 --> 22:04.120
them to like, I think it's both of those things. I mean, I think to a certain extent all of

22:04.120 --> 22:10.200
us have some type of sociopathic tendencies. And we noticed that in our behavior and sometimes

22:10.200 --> 22:16.160
we're ashamed of it. We try to get away from it. But you know, I think there is some darkness

22:16.160 --> 22:21.960
in all of us, whether it ever comes out or not. And for me, that was the fascination

22:21.960 --> 22:27.400
was just, you know, am I like this? Who is like this? Why are they like this? Why are

22:27.400 --> 22:34.560
they more like this than me? Yeah, yeah, why is this person considering themselves like

22:34.560 --> 22:40.960
a candidate for driving their children into a river and jumping out of the car and blaming

22:40.960 --> 22:46.840
it on a random minority? Like why did they just think that was okay to do? Which of them

22:46.840 --> 22:51.000
got away with it? Why did they get away with it? What did they do when they were in police

22:51.000 --> 22:55.720
custody? Like it extends to all of them. Yeah, when you watch the TV shows, like I'm you know,

22:55.720 --> 23:01.560
I watched the forensic files and the data lines and stuff like that. And they the cops

23:01.560 --> 23:04.680
frequently go yeah, you know, they always think they're smarter than us. You know, this

23:04.680 --> 23:09.640
guy thought he knew all the angles. But like, I wonder how many people that are really smart

23:09.640 --> 23:14.600
actually do know all the angles and get away with it. It's like, they kind of are smarter

23:14.600 --> 23:20.760
than you, a lot of them, because you guys do it every day. And we were talking about this

23:20.760 --> 23:25.080
at dinner last night, I like, like, like, I don't know what the percentage is. But I

23:25.080 --> 23:30.080
think the difficult thing for cops who I am, I am my fan of true crime is like making me

23:30.080 --> 23:33.960
a big fan of homicide detectives, because Jesus Christ, if you think working at Kinko's

23:33.960 --> 23:38.040
is hard, like, it's like, like, like, like this, this like idea that they have to work

23:38.040 --> 23:42.320
with these people and they have to get confessions out of them. And then half of the time, if

23:42.320 --> 23:46.840
they successfully get a confession, it's like, you asked why he's not guilty. And they're

23:46.840 --> 23:55.240
like, but I only did what I like. So most of the time they're lying. And but they, they

23:55.240 --> 24:01.040
like, it's like a lot of times like you, you watch like forensic files and the cops will

24:01.040 --> 24:06.360
talk about their techniques and they'll go, they'll, they'll leverage the fact that the

24:06.360 --> 24:13.320
average person given an average person that commits a murder, like that they'll, they'll

24:13.320 --> 24:16.920
be leveraged by the idea that the cop wants to be their friend, for instance.

24:16.920 --> 24:17.920
Oh, yeah, definitely.

24:17.920 --> 24:22.680
That they'll be like, Oh, don't you seem like a smart guy? And the person will respond and

24:22.680 --> 24:25.920
they'll do the saying like, I don't think you want to be dishonest. Like I think you

24:25.920 --> 24:29.960
want to do right by the mother of the victim and stuff. And it's like that that impulse

24:29.960 --> 24:31.960
to like not let the cop down.

24:31.960 --> 24:35.920
Yeah, they're seeking validation. And the cops know that. Yeah, they tend to just feed

24:35.920 --> 24:39.640
right into that. And the cops, whatever they see, that is, whatever they see is lacking

24:39.640 --> 24:44.480
within that person, whatever the desperation is that cause them to commit the crimes. That's

24:44.480 --> 24:46.000
generally what they go after.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.760
That's just what an abuser does is notice, notice what the person what pushes the person's

24:51.760 --> 24:54.240
right. It tries to feed into that to manipulate them.

24:54.240 --> 24:59.040
But you're kind of an abuser abuser when you're right, when you when you suspect that a person

24:59.040 --> 25:02.840
is yeah, and it's like that's the thing is like, I don't know what I haven't heard cops

25:02.840 --> 25:07.240
talk a lot about on these true crime shows. The ones that I love because they have cops

25:07.240 --> 25:12.600
involved like they don't. It's like there aren't any rules when you're dealing with sociopaths.

25:12.600 --> 25:18.220
I like your show because you talk a lot about your you talk about sociopaths in what seems

25:18.220 --> 25:23.080
to me to be the right way. Because it's like, I don't want to praise them. I don't think

25:23.080 --> 25:27.280
they're better than us. At the same time, I don't think I don't think we should pretend

25:27.280 --> 25:32.960
that they're like they don't exist. But like, I like that you're kind of like you're always

25:32.960 --> 25:38.720
like, this guy's a fucking idiot. That's the thing is he thinks he can just he's such

25:38.720 --> 25:44.720
a sociopath. He's going to call 911 and just make up a murder story. And here's the thing,

25:44.720 --> 25:49.440
you can't do that. That's really hard for people that make them up for a living to do

25:49.440 --> 25:55.000
as much anything on television. It doesn't work. Like the people that are great at that

25:55.000 --> 25:58.920
the people that are great at making the perfect fake 911 call or whatever, they end up being

25:58.920 --> 26:03.000
so proud of themselves that they can't wait to tell everybody that they hang out with.

26:03.000 --> 26:09.080
Man, I fucking told I called 911. It is true. They're so proud of themselves about it.

26:09.080 --> 26:14.520
What is it? Can you tell me the difference between a sociopath and a psychopath?

26:14.520 --> 26:20.000
You know, I've actually made up my own rules about that because I love to hear it. Yeah.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.960
As far as a sociopath goes, well, psychopath, first of all, psychopath, we think of as a

26:24.960 --> 26:30.080
puppet master. So they're generally people who use their resources as a puppet master

26:30.080 --> 26:34.640
over something or somebody else in that manner. So we think of like there were the case of

26:34.640 --> 26:38.800
Michelle Carter and I don't know if anybody's familiar with that. She was the one who had

26:38.800 --> 26:43.760
the boyfriend who committed suicide or her urging. She sent him hundreds of texts saying

26:43.760 --> 26:48.600
kill yourself now, do it now, do it now because she had that emotional power over him. John

26:48.600 --> 26:54.400
Wayne Gacy, somebody like that, another classic psychopath. He's a guy who was offering jobs

26:54.400 --> 26:58.800
that paid much more than anybody else would pay for labor. So he was able to get young

26:58.800 --> 27:02.600
men to do things they wouldn't normally do. And they took a lot of risks and they would

27:02.600 --> 27:06.880
stick around his home because if they didn't, they couldn't make that money. And so he

27:06.880 --> 27:11.000
was more of a puppet master like that. But with the sociopath, I generally think of them

27:11.000 --> 27:15.560
more as leeches. And so what they're doing is they're manipulating you for your resources

27:15.560 --> 27:21.440
rather than using theirs to control you. They're generally lazier. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, they're

27:21.440 --> 27:28.640
considered fringe characters. Sociopaths settle. Sometimes they take the spotlight because

27:28.640 --> 27:34.080
of where they landed. Who would have expected a sociopath to become CEO of this company?

27:34.080 --> 27:38.760
And then it's like, whoa, this sociopath is the star of this show, but it's only really

27:38.760 --> 27:44.400
because of the situation they landed in. Combined with the fact that a sociopath is like a jellyfish.

27:44.400 --> 27:50.000
They're like, I'll do whatever I can to survive. I have no fucking empathy. And a psychopath

27:50.000 --> 27:55.800
has a little bit of an itch. It's like, I'm playing Grand Theft Auto and it's pretty boring.

27:55.800 --> 28:01.120
Like, what do I got to do to make this interesting? They want, they have a little bit of the-

28:01.120 --> 28:06.400
Are there psychopaths that actually just like gamblers will take terrible risks to make

28:06.400 --> 28:11.920
stupid bets because they get a kick out of the action? They call it, right? Are there

28:11.920 --> 28:16.880
psychopathic murderers and criminals? I'm sure there are. That do it simply for that

28:16.880 --> 28:24.280
kind of adrenaline thing? Or is it the simple idea that they feel that they're allowed to

28:24.280 --> 28:29.040
because they have that status? Yeah, I mean, the psychopath is generally

28:29.040 --> 28:32.800
just known for having no regard for anybody else. And so that's why they're sometimes

28:32.800 --> 28:40.520
good corporate CEOs and things of that nature. I read that they're more comfortable drifting

28:40.520 --> 28:46.720
that a psychopath is like a coconut. They contain everything they need. Like, a psychopath

28:46.720 --> 28:52.520
could go years just wandering around. And a sociopath actually gets anxious about like,

28:52.520 --> 28:58.120
I don't know, I feel like I don't even have a family. Like, even though they don't actually

28:58.120 --> 29:04.400
empathize with, but they feel anxiety about uprooting and wandering. And a psychopath

29:04.400 --> 29:09.560
is like, actually, the open roads, the only place to be. That's one thing that I read.

29:09.560 --> 29:15.520
Are there other classifications beyond psychopath and sociopath for the people that you like

29:15.520 --> 29:19.480
profile on your show? Yeah, I mean, there are plenty of subcategories

29:19.480 --> 29:23.960
and things of that nature. But I mean, those are generally the two major classifications.

29:23.960 --> 29:31.520
What kind of, if you murder someone for any reason other than food, or them trying to

29:31.520 --> 29:36.640
make you food. You might be a redneck. I mean, if you murder

29:36.640 --> 29:43.040
someone, are you automatically a sociopath? Can you be like retro diagnosed as a sociopath?

29:43.040 --> 29:47.240
No, not necessarily. I mean, you could just be somebody who flipped out at any moment

29:47.240 --> 29:52.800
and killed someone. It could be an anger issue. For sociopaths, generally what I believe they've

29:52.800 --> 29:57.720
been created to do, I believe that their brains have been created specifically to not allow

29:57.720 --> 30:03.440
them to make adjustments in their narrative as far as what they do on a daily basis.

30:03.440 --> 30:08.000
So a lot of detectives will tell you that when you're dealing with a sociopath, generally

30:08.000 --> 30:13.400
what happens is they have a very rigid logic. And so they follow that logic and they don't

30:13.400 --> 30:15.080
veer from it at all. The detectives.

30:15.080 --> 30:19.600
Well, no, the sociopath. That's, I knew that.

30:19.600 --> 30:24.920
By not veering from the logic, they will continue to make mistakes again and again and again

30:24.920 --> 30:25.920
up until.

30:25.920 --> 30:30.120
Because they've written a story in their mind that can't be like deviated from.

30:30.120 --> 30:35.440
Yeah. And there's a lot of denial involved. And the reason the denial is involved is because,

30:35.440 --> 30:38.880
like you're saying, they can't deviate from the original plan. And so they will just follow

30:38.880 --> 30:43.360
through even if the logic doesn't make sense. And the idea is the brain has been developed

30:43.360 --> 30:47.560
like that specifically to put them in prison. But in the process, we're creating a lot of

30:47.560 --> 30:50.320
technology related to detecting light.

30:50.320 --> 30:54.760
Right. They've been placed by God as like debugging equipment.

30:54.760 --> 30:55.760
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

30:55.760 --> 31:01.680
That their job is to go through the highway map and constantly try to turn right.

31:01.680 --> 31:02.680
Yes.

31:02.680 --> 31:07.080
And if they're able to, it either represents a place where you need an on-ramp as in Lizzie

31:07.080 --> 31:08.080
Borden, possibly.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.080
Yeah, right.

31:09.080 --> 31:13.440
Like you did a Lizzie Borden episode where your take on it was very, you're like, I mean,

31:13.440 --> 31:18.840
I don't mean to put words in your mouth, but my brutish summation of your take on Lizzie

31:18.840 --> 31:25.440
Borden was basically like, this is a woman who if she was being denied the things that

31:25.440 --> 31:33.200
she felt she deserved in like 40 years difference, like there wouldn't be as much question about

31:33.200 --> 31:38.800
what she was entitled to. This was a woman who was being told at her place in time that

31:38.800 --> 31:44.480
there's no, you're in a cell socially, like, oh, you're a spinster. You either need to

31:44.480 --> 31:48.800
marry a man and submit to his will, or you need to do what your father says. And she

31:48.800 --> 31:54.600
was like, psych, I have a hack for that. No pun intended.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.600
I have 30.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.600
Which is short for hatchet.

31:58.600 --> 31:59.600
Yes, exactly.

31:59.600 --> 32:03.400
And I mean, did I paraphrase you wrong?

32:03.400 --> 32:04.400
No, that's great.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.280
I mean, that's a great example of that as well.

32:06.280 --> 32:09.520
Not that these people are gods or monsters or heroes or villains, but that sometimes

32:09.520 --> 32:14.400
their functionality is a scrubbing bubble, that they're like going like, hey, there's

32:14.400 --> 32:19.320
a fucking, like there's railings here that like a woman isn't allowed to do anything

32:19.320 --> 32:22.720
except chop a mother fucker.

32:22.720 --> 32:30.040
And we do, we do that. We do that with, that's why our history is like such a roller coaster

32:30.040 --> 32:35.120
of like criminals that become like exonerated things, like sometimes the sociopaths are

32:35.120 --> 32:39.760
like, it's like, oh, they're not a role model. However, if it weren't for them, blibbity

32:39.760 --> 32:40.760
blue blue.

32:40.760 --> 32:44.760
Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's a, there's a thing that makes a sociopath special is that

32:44.760 --> 32:45.760
like, for instance,

32:45.760 --> 32:46.760
Is it?

32:46.760 --> 32:47.760
He's writing it down.

32:47.760 --> 32:48.760
How do you spell blibbity blue?

32:48.760 --> 32:49.760
B-L-I-V-E-E-E.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.760
It's two-piece, two-piece.

32:50.760 --> 32:51.760
Yeah.

32:51.760 --> 32:52.760
Sorry, I go ahead.

32:52.760 --> 32:58.920
I'm sorry. And I'm sorry I'm a bad interviewer and I'm sorry for everything.

32:58.920 --> 32:59.920
But Lizzie Borden.

32:59.920 --> 33:00.920
I don't even remember what I was going to say.

33:00.920 --> 33:05.560
She was a, she was like, what, 19, something like early in the past and she was in a big

33:05.560 --> 33:09.520
house and she killed her dad to get the house and she got away with it more or less is the

33:09.520 --> 33:10.520
theory.

33:10.520 --> 33:11.520
Yeah, she killed her mom too.

33:11.520 --> 33:16.120
Because, right, because, because like, she just was like, ah, I was painting and I got

33:16.120 --> 33:21.160
these clothes red with paint and now I threw them out and it's not suspicious back then.

33:21.160 --> 33:24.760
And so like, she was just exploiting the legal system or the system.

33:24.760 --> 33:28.200
Yeah, she just totally exploited the legal system. It's something that happens on a daily

33:28.200 --> 33:33.560
basis now. And because of incidents like that, and we were able to create better forensics,

33:33.560 --> 33:35.720
we now under have a better understanding of that.

33:35.720 --> 33:39.960
So that's really the purpose of the sociopath is to advance that technology over and over

33:39.960 --> 33:40.960
and over.

33:40.960 --> 33:45.440
So their faulty logic ensures when they want something and they can't get it, they'll engage

33:45.440 --> 33:48.200
criminality because there's just no other way to get it.

33:48.200 --> 33:52.680
So if you're Lizzie Borden, you're stuck in this house, you don't get your father's money.

33:52.680 --> 33:56.200
He's healthy and he's not going to die for a long time.

33:56.200 --> 34:00.320
You basically just do whatever you have to do to make sure he's dead without even worrying

34:00.320 --> 34:01.320
about the logic.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.840
And that's generally how the sociopath works.

34:03.840 --> 34:10.800
So you have this thing that you do that other podcasters don't do where you have a lot of

34:10.800 --> 34:11.800
those.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.200
You have, you do it fully nude.

34:14.200 --> 34:15.200
Yes.

34:15.200 --> 34:16.200
Yes.

34:16.200 --> 34:22.200
I actually requested to do this show nude and dad was like, I don't know, I don't know.

34:22.200 --> 34:26.400
But you do, you kind of pick, I'm kind of curious about your process, but you can tell me, no,

34:26.400 --> 34:27.400
that jumps the shark.

34:27.400 --> 34:33.160
I can't tell you exactly how I do it, but I'm curious about how you, like you pick a case

34:33.160 --> 34:38.560
because part of your gimmick is you pretty much always go lateral.

34:38.560 --> 34:47.680
I mean, you, you, you, the, for me as a consumer, the joy of true crime is that it's like, these

34:47.680 --> 34:52.680
are all different personalities, but the canon is all the same because it's true crime.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.280
Everyone's going to do JonBenét Ramsey.

34:54.280 --> 35:00.080
And I want them to, I, and it, because I want the same way that Shakespeare was just adapting

35:00.080 --> 35:01.080
whatever.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.040
Harmon, shut up and just get to your point.

35:03.040 --> 35:10.920
My point is that like your, your unique gimmick is that you, you actually do kind of investigate

35:10.920 --> 35:11.920
these things.

35:11.920 --> 35:21.040
You pick cases that have questionable resolutions and you, you very proudly put a crown on your

35:21.040 --> 35:26.480
head and go like, look, here's the thing, I don't need any more information than I have.

35:26.480 --> 35:30.040
I don't know, a lot of people talk about, they wish this autopsy photo came back, but

35:30.040 --> 35:31.040
guess what?

35:31.040 --> 35:33.000
You don't fucking need it.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.080
All you need, all you need to solve this case is to think about one thing, evolution.

35:38.080 --> 35:43.320
And you, and it's, it's either the, like Cody at my fiance and I were like, oh, it's

35:43.320 --> 35:48.320
go like, we go, he goes, you always like, you go, like, it's going to be one thing.

35:48.320 --> 35:54.120
It's either going to be evolution resources or redirection of light and, and I'm not mocking

35:54.120 --> 36:00.560
you because it is, you go, you commit to that like a crazy kind of Colombo like, like, like

36:00.560 --> 36:02.760
detective, like you're good at it.

36:02.760 --> 36:03.760
You do it well.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.240
What is redirection of light?

36:05.240 --> 36:06.240
Oh, yes.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.240
Please explain this.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.240
It is.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.240
This is great.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.760
Well, we got, we got some, some light redirection things.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.760
Some ROL fans out there.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.040
This is, this is, this is one of your big things.

36:15.040 --> 36:18.600
And for those who aren't indoctrinated, it's like, like, I mean, you're constantly talking

36:18.600 --> 36:20.000
about redirection of light.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Yeah.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.400
I mean, redirection of light can, that, it's actually, I mean, it's just essentially just

36:25.400 --> 36:26.960
blocking the truth in some way.

36:26.960 --> 36:30.960
It can be thought of in many ways, but I think one of the ways that I explained it recently,

36:30.960 --> 36:34.920
I covered the Justin Ross Harris case, if everybody's familiar with that.

36:34.920 --> 36:37.400
He was a hot car death with his young son.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.400
And he's in prison for it now.

36:38.400 --> 36:44.160
Is that the guy that left his kid in the car and then went to, yeah, he, he, he just,

36:44.160 --> 36:47.960
he left his kid in the car when he went to work instead of taking the kid to daycare.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.640
And it was in Atlanta in June.

36:49.640 --> 36:55.600
And he claimed that he, his case was, I didn't know, I'm hearing in periods.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.560
I forgot my kid was in the car.

36:57.560 --> 36:59.160
I, I, I took him to work.

36:59.160 --> 37:02.720
I went to work and then we went to lunch and then my kid got cooked in a car.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.720
Yeah.

37:03.720 --> 37:07.840
And he claimed, he had claimed that for seven hours, he didn't think of his son.

37:07.840 --> 37:12.280
And you could see by the way that he had parked his vehicle and the movements that he made

37:12.280 --> 37:16.760
coming in and out of the building, that he was intentionally avoiding certain things and

37:16.760 --> 37:19.600
was positioning his vehicle in certain ways.

37:19.600 --> 37:23.960
And the one of the, like I said, the sociopath is unable to see when, once he reaches the

37:23.960 --> 37:28.760
stage of denial, he's unable to see that he's not making adaptations to his plan.

37:28.760 --> 37:33.520
And so one of the instances of redirected light that I talked about was that he pulls

37:33.520 --> 37:39.440
the vehicle into the parking space by backing in because he wants to be able to get out

37:39.440 --> 37:42.500
and not have to look into the back of the vehicle.

37:42.500 --> 37:47.680
So if he pulls in forward, he has to get out and walk past the door where his son is in

37:47.680 --> 37:49.600
the car seat and he would see him.

37:49.600 --> 37:55.160
So he intentionally backs in, but by backing in what happens is he creates a situation

37:55.160 --> 37:58.960
where he would have seen the kid in the backseat through the side mirror.

37:58.960 --> 37:59.960
I'm sorry.

37:59.960 --> 38:00.960
I don't quite follow that.

38:00.960 --> 38:05.080
I didn't normally, he would have to, are you saying he has to look over the backseat

38:05.080 --> 38:07.440
to back out of the space and he would see the kid in the backseat?

38:07.440 --> 38:09.240
Let's say the, where is the kid sitting, front or backseat?

38:09.240 --> 38:10.880
The kid's in a car seat in the back.

38:10.880 --> 38:14.760
So let's say he would normally pull in face first.

38:14.760 --> 38:19.000
And so every other vehicle in the parking lot is like that, except for his, his is backed

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
in.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Because he doesn't want to walk past the backseat.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
He wants to walk forward.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.200
If he were to pull in forward, he has to get out and walk past the backseat and he'll

38:26.200 --> 38:27.720
see the car seat.

38:27.720 --> 38:29.200
So he avoids doing that.

38:29.200 --> 38:34.160
But what he can't see as a sociopath is that he's actually redirecting that light.

38:34.160 --> 38:38.800
And so what that means is that by parking the vehicle and backing it in, what he's doing

38:38.800 --> 38:44.720
is he's creating a situation where he has to use the rear view and also the side mirror

38:44.720 --> 38:46.600
in order to back into the spot.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.120
And while doing that, he would very clearly see his son.

38:49.120 --> 38:52.920
He would have used more, more light to see the reflection of his son in the backseat

38:52.920 --> 38:53.920
of the car.

38:53.920 --> 38:58.760
So in fact, hours later, that's how he actually says he sees his son.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.480
He says, I was changing a lane.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.800
I looked in the mirror and I saw him in the back.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.760
But he would have seen that when he parked the vehicle.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.040
He was not able to understand that though.

39:08.040 --> 39:13.800
You've got, sometimes you have flare ups like, like that, I remember you saying about that

39:13.800 --> 39:14.800
guy.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.200
You're like, but this guy, and he says this, but here's the thing.

39:17.200 --> 39:20.280
I'm about to squash his fucking life like a grape.

39:20.280 --> 39:25.360
Like you, you, you have, you have little, not his life, but you probably said like his logic

39:25.360 --> 39:26.360
or something.

39:26.360 --> 39:33.720
And you, I love that about you that you're like, you, you have nerd hulk outs, like you're,

39:33.720 --> 39:37.360
and then also you're like, you know, and I know, I know, I know half of you think I'm

39:37.360 --> 39:39.640
full of fucking shit, but here's the thing.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.640
You're fucking wrong.

39:40.640 --> 39:47.360
So do you take, and now I can't wait to listen to the show, I'm sorry that I'm late to the

39:47.360 --> 39:53.160
game on this, but like, do you take evidence that was already there and go, I picked that

39:53.160 --> 39:57.920
evidence for, for me to go, that's the thing, or do you put it all together and go, I'm

39:57.920 --> 40:01.880
going to make my own extrapolation out of that and, and say, here's what I think that

40:01.880 --> 40:03.800
no detective had already landed on.

40:03.800 --> 40:04.800
Yeah.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.920
I mean, I generally try to extract whatever the human brain is doing.

40:07.920 --> 40:13.280
So if I look into the psychology, then I'll start analyzing the philosophy of it and the

40:13.280 --> 40:16.520
sociology as well and just go, just go off on a rant.

40:16.520 --> 40:17.520
Right.

40:17.520 --> 40:21.520
So the car thing is like, he's creating plausible deniability almost, but creating plausible

40:21.520 --> 40:26.480
deniability is someone, something a guilty person does so that they can then claim they're

40:26.480 --> 40:27.480
getting away with it.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.200
So that gets back to the redirection of light.

40:29.200 --> 40:33.120
He's creating this incident where he could pretend to be telling the truth, but he's

40:33.120 --> 40:38.880
actually engineering a dishonest situation and that has evidence that looks like a dishonest

40:38.880 --> 40:39.880
situation being created.

40:39.880 --> 40:46.640
It takes energy to like, it almost think like it's like when you were talking about, oh,

40:46.640 --> 40:48.920
he would have looked in his room every mirror and all that stuff.

40:48.920 --> 40:54.680
Actually, that pales in comparison to the fact that like, if he pulled in head first

40:54.680 --> 41:01.000
to his parking spot every day and then that day backed in, boom, you're done.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.240
Redirection of light, right?

41:02.240 --> 41:07.520
Because he's doing something specific that day and he's doing it because what's on his

41:07.520 --> 41:13.760
mind is, I don't want anyone to perceive me as having seen my baby.

41:13.760 --> 41:17.720
I think people that back in for no reason are fucking weird just to start with.

41:17.720 --> 41:25.440
Oh, I do that, I do that because at the end of the day, I wanted to go home.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.200
At the beginning of the day, I have more energy.

41:27.200 --> 41:34.360
I'm like, I want to start the day, you've got so much energy, oh, man, I can't wait

41:34.360 --> 41:39.800
to do a fucking complicated maneuver forward to my grumpy self at the end of the day.

41:39.800 --> 41:43.440
It's like me saying grumpy Dan, get out of here.

41:43.440 --> 41:44.440
It's five o'clock.

41:44.440 --> 41:45.440
Get out of here.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.440
Beat traffic.

41:46.440 --> 41:47.440
Thank you.

41:47.440 --> 41:50.120
Ryan, does that make him psychopath or sociopath?

41:50.120 --> 41:52.320
I'm going to go with sociopath.

41:52.320 --> 41:53.320
Yeah, definitely.

41:53.320 --> 41:54.320
Because I'm lazy.

41:54.320 --> 41:55.320
I think that is sociopathic.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.320
Yeah.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.320
No, no, I love your Instagram workouts.

41:57.320 --> 41:58.320
Opportunistic.

41:58.320 --> 42:05.920
I'm like, this is a way to, I want to talk about your, like, but you're the, well, I

42:05.920 --> 42:10.400
do want to say this redirection of light thing or like the thing that you do that's so specific,

42:10.400 --> 42:16.080
I want to, I want to insert there because I have said on this podcast, even to other

42:16.080 --> 42:20.200
true crime people, I'm like, you know, the true crime story that really bums me out,

42:20.200 --> 42:25.080
that really freaks me out, keeps me up at night, was this Kaniqa Powell, is it Kamiqa

42:25.080 --> 42:26.080
or Kaniqa?

42:26.080 --> 42:31.280
It was the young lady who, the guy came to her door, he pretended he was a UPS guy and

42:31.280 --> 42:32.280
all this stuff.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.880
There was like two guys and all this stuff.

42:33.880 --> 42:38.040
She was like, like, and then she ends up getting shot and there's no robbery, all this stuff.

42:38.040 --> 42:43.240
It was just so disturbing to me because it felt, it was, it just filled me with anxiety

42:43.240 --> 42:46.760
and like, why isn't there a task force, what is going on?

42:46.760 --> 42:53.360
And he did an episode on it and it was like, as an example of what you, how what you do

42:53.360 --> 42:55.440
can kind of actually be beneficial.

42:55.440 --> 42:58.800
You have the same information that anyone else has, but you're tracing it through and

42:58.800 --> 43:05.800
going, what do the guy or guys that are doing this shit to her have in common?

43:05.800 --> 43:07.680
They're idiots.

43:07.680 --> 43:12.800
I mean, they're bad at their job, like they're dumb, they're children.

43:12.800 --> 43:17.000
They're trying to get into her apartment and they're doing a terrible job at it.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.280
They're failing every step of the way.

43:19.280 --> 43:25.920
And then following that track, that explains her death in the end because what happens

43:25.920 --> 43:32.400
to this poor young lady is she comes back, she's in her lobby of her own hotel place

43:32.400 --> 43:39.560
and then all we know is that some guy shoots her and runs away, but the way that you break

43:39.560 --> 43:46.240
it down is like, yeah, no, the same idiot children that were so desperate to have her

43:46.240 --> 43:52.640
in her apartment, they were, that desperation planted them like children, idiot children

43:52.640 --> 43:57.560
where she lived, waited for her to come back, did what idiot children would do.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.840
She reacted the way an adult would.

43:59.840 --> 44:03.480
They reacted the way a child would because she wasn't going to go in a fucking apartment

44:03.480 --> 44:07.920
with a fucking child with a gun that's been trying to get, she's like, no fuck you, I'm

44:07.920 --> 44:15.840
a military trained adult and this person shot her and ran like a child.

44:15.840 --> 44:22.280
And that is why it's like, oh, there was no, her wallet wasn't taken and all this stuff,

44:22.280 --> 44:26.160
which is the stuff that panicked me because I was like, this is a professional hit, how

44:26.160 --> 44:31.840
are we ignoring this, we need, the government killed her.

44:31.840 --> 44:37.080
And instead you're like, no, this is all explained and the guy that did it was active in that

44:37.080 --> 44:41.320
area and then stopped being active, he's in prison right now, he did this kind of thing,

44:41.320 --> 44:44.960
he probably did that, he wouldn't confess to it because that would add to his time and

44:44.960 --> 44:47.160
it's all good.

44:47.160 --> 44:53.760
It's like you, your unique way of looking at things like actually had like, it was like

44:53.760 --> 44:57.280
you solved the case for me, you made me sleep at night.

44:57.280 --> 45:03.800
Do you think Ryan that, not having listened to the show, and I will, I promise, that what

45:03.800 --> 45:07.680
you're good at, what makes your show good, do you think that you might be valuable as

45:07.680 --> 45:08.680
a resource to law enforcement?

45:08.680 --> 45:12.400
I think he should be an actual detective, use answer it.

45:12.400 --> 45:20.560
You know, I've actually never really given any thought to that, I have had people approach

45:20.560 --> 45:26.160
me and say, hey, did you ever think that you could contribute to law enforcement, I'm not

45:26.160 --> 45:30.640
so sure that a lot of what I do is very grounded, but I think it is.

45:30.640 --> 45:36.920
I mean, I wouldn't say you would be a great, you wouldn't hold up in a courtroom necessarily,

45:36.920 --> 45:40.080
but then again, like profilers and people that like, you might be the person that they

45:40.080 --> 45:42.920
go to and just go like, like Ryan, what do you think about this guy?

45:42.920 --> 45:46.920
He sounds like, you know, he sounds like a classic number 17.

45:46.920 --> 45:49.640
Yeah, I definitely think I would be beneficial in that way for sure.

45:49.640 --> 45:50.640
Yeah, that'd be great.

45:50.640 --> 45:56.000
Do you think that, because you would consider yourself like the equivalent of like a psychic

45:56.000 --> 46:02.160
in the sense that if it works, it works, well, sometimes, yeah, well, there's like, there's

46:02.160 --> 46:07.280
crime shows about a guy who's like his eyebrows twitching, you know what that means is thinking

46:07.280 --> 46:08.280
about his mom.

46:08.280 --> 46:11.680
And it's like, that's not going to hold up in court, but in the TV show, it works fucking

46:11.680 --> 46:14.360
great because that makes the guy confessed and then that does work.

46:14.360 --> 46:18.840
Well, if it helps you knock on the right door, and then that guy tries to crawl the window,

46:18.840 --> 46:19.840
you got it.

46:19.840 --> 46:20.840
Yeah.

46:20.840 --> 46:21.960
It's like, oh, how'd you, how'd you knock on my door?

46:21.960 --> 46:24.640
A profiler told us, what the fuck's a profiler?

46:24.640 --> 46:29.040
Yeah, that shit doesn't hold up in court, but like, and sometimes that's a psychic.

46:29.040 --> 46:34.360
Like you hear law enforcement sometimes say, they have this like weird relationship with

46:34.360 --> 46:40.200
psychics that call in because they're kind of going, and I heard you say this on your

46:40.200 --> 46:45.720
podcast where what I'm hearing you say is something that agent Dale Cooper on Twin Peaks

46:45.720 --> 46:52.160
would say, which is if, if the make you sound more legitimate, by the way, if the linear

46:52.160 --> 46:57.440
path isn't working, figure out any other way to look at this.

46:57.440 --> 47:01.840
And so sometimes you'll go, so I'm looking at this whole thing from the perspective of

47:01.840 --> 47:07.480
John Hughes movies, and it's like, well, wait, that's not, but then you're like, now looking

47:07.480 --> 47:11.680
at that from that perspective, you discover different details, or you notice different

47:11.680 --> 47:17.800
connections, and then you draw different conclusions, which more often than not solve the crime.

47:17.800 --> 47:18.800
It's a good podcast.

47:18.800 --> 47:24.000
Like, speaking of movies, like, it's like an old, like, like an old Western, like you'd

47:24.000 --> 47:30.840
be a great like country judge, like, I know the law says this and the law says that, but

47:30.840 --> 47:32.320
no, you're, he's a Pinkerton.

47:32.320 --> 47:33.320
He's a Pinkerton.

47:33.320 --> 47:45.440
This guy's clearly from, I don't know if you've ever seen 16 candles, but, but like, do you

47:45.440 --> 47:49.320
like, just talk about that for a second, because you've addressed that a couple of times in

47:49.320 --> 47:55.600
your podcast, like, it's sort of like, it's you, you're a hero to me because you kind

47:55.600 --> 48:00.400
of like, everyone's around like, wait, this guy believes in voodoo.

48:00.400 --> 48:05.880
And then you're, and then the other sentence, you're like, oh no, you're like such a, you're

48:05.880 --> 48:12.960
such a, like, logician, and you're bridging some gap there, where you believe that it's

48:12.960 --> 48:15.480
all about perspective or something.

48:15.480 --> 48:19.880
Yeah, I mean, I think there's part of my show that I guess I should probably clarify.

48:19.880 --> 48:21.760
I've always been very polarizing.

48:21.760 --> 48:25.280
And obviously, you know that a lot, I mean, a lot of people hate my show.

48:25.280 --> 48:31.760
So it's always been, oh, it's always been about logic and about trolling people as well.

48:31.760 --> 48:34.080
Because I have a lot of hate listeners.

48:34.080 --> 48:37.120
And so do you actively troll people?

48:37.120 --> 48:38.880
I think my show is an active troll.

48:38.880 --> 48:42.640
I think a five hour episode is pretty much, you know, no, no, I mean, you're not like,

48:42.640 --> 48:46.320
oh, I know, I'm only doing this because my haters are going to hate it.

48:46.320 --> 48:47.800
No, no, absolutely not.

48:47.800 --> 48:50.880
No, I mean, just the general nature of the show and how I put it together.

48:50.880 --> 48:52.380
What is the average?

48:52.380 --> 48:56.160
The things that, wait, when I find trolling the people who hate the show, that's usually

48:56.160 --> 48:57.960
to the benefit of the people who like it.

48:57.960 --> 48:58.960
Yeah.

48:58.960 --> 49:02.720
What is your average troll beefing about with your show that it's too not logic based

49:02.720 --> 49:03.720
or?

49:03.720 --> 49:10.880
Oh, it's like, it's anything from the production to the audacity of my conclusions to my voice

49:10.880 --> 49:13.280
to the way I present things to the cadence.

49:13.280 --> 49:19.880
But that's great because you're doing basically more of, you're doing an opinion piece.

49:19.880 --> 49:25.520
You're lending your own subjective ideas on the things.

49:25.520 --> 49:31.400
And the people that edit opinion editorial pages and newspapers, they love the hate mail.

49:31.400 --> 49:34.760
That means people are reading and that means that we're creating a conversation.

49:34.760 --> 49:35.760
So that's good.

49:35.760 --> 49:36.760
Yeah.

49:36.760 --> 49:37.760
I mean, that's definitely part of what I do.

49:37.760 --> 49:41.600
You know, a lot of true crime shows you listen to, regardless of whether they're good or

49:41.600 --> 49:46.360
bad, you know, there's kind of a thing where people are not quite committing to certain

49:46.360 --> 49:48.200
conclusion in a case for whatever reason.

49:48.200 --> 49:52.360
I mean, it might not be what the show is about, but I tend to just be audacious and go for

49:52.360 --> 49:53.600
it and just say what I think.

49:53.600 --> 49:57.360
I think it's an interesting intersection between true crime and podcasting is that the part

49:57.360 --> 50:01.480
of you that wants to podcast is the part of you that wants somebody out there to like

50:01.480 --> 50:02.480
you.

50:02.480 --> 50:04.360
Otherwise, why podcast it?

50:04.360 --> 50:08.360
But the part of you that likes true crime is the part of you that wants to acknowledge

50:08.360 --> 50:12.920
that life is disgusting and toxic and predatory.

50:12.920 --> 50:14.520
And so it's tough.

50:14.520 --> 50:20.560
I've talked to the red handed gals about this, how it's like, I like them because they're,

50:20.560 --> 50:24.840
they don't, they don't constantly pause and I understand the constant pauses with true

50:24.840 --> 50:28.680
crime podcasters where they're like, by the way, this is about the victim and not about

50:28.680 --> 50:31.520
the, oh, no one wants to hear about what Jack the Ripper did.

50:31.520 --> 50:32.840
He's not a hero or anything.

50:32.840 --> 50:35.800
But anyways, this episode is called Jack the Ripper.

50:35.800 --> 50:46.000
And it's really about the victims and it's like, I like that you're, I mean, we need

50:46.000 --> 50:53.480
people that are, you clearly hear the haters and then you're like, all right, that's expected,

50:53.480 --> 50:54.480
but here's the thing.

50:54.480 --> 50:57.000
I'm a genius.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.240
Of course you'd hate that.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.040
I'm going to blow your fucking mind.

51:00.040 --> 51:04.600
Is it ever a guest or is it just you just straight to Mike?

51:04.600 --> 51:05.600
It's just me.

51:05.600 --> 51:09.320
It'd be funny to hear a guest.

51:09.320 --> 51:13.920
Can I be for the first guest because I would be like, oh, shit, the air conditioner went

51:13.920 --> 51:14.920
on again.

51:14.920 --> 51:15.920
I sit there with Cody.

51:15.920 --> 51:16.920
I'm like, oh, God damn it.

51:16.920 --> 51:17.920
The air conditioner went on.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.480
Who wants to see Dan on the show?

51:19.480 --> 51:22.960
I mean, it's his audience.

51:22.960 --> 51:29.120
Don't let me ruin your show, though, like I don't set the sociopath, you're like an

51:29.120 --> 51:31.920
ooze trying to get in and destroy his show.

51:31.920 --> 51:33.080
I don't want to ruin things.

51:33.080 --> 51:38.920
I debated on the show because I really, that's how much affection I have for your show and

51:38.920 --> 51:40.760
there for you is like, we talked about that.

51:40.760 --> 51:42.880
I was like, I don't want to keep doing this thing.

51:42.880 --> 51:46.680
I don't want to keep jabbing my ruler into primordial ooze.

51:46.680 --> 51:49.560
I love true crime podcasting because it's punk rock.

51:49.560 --> 51:56.480
I think it's fucked up that I'm kind of getting tired of like laying in bed with Cody and

51:56.480 --> 52:02.520
then the neck and it's like, oh, in other news, I guess I'm going on Harmontown and

52:02.520 --> 52:04.080
I'm kind of like, am I fucking up?

52:04.080 --> 52:05.080
Am I fucking up?

52:05.080 --> 52:06.200
Or am I signal boosting?

52:06.200 --> 52:07.400
I want a signal boost.

52:07.400 --> 52:08.600
I don't want to fuck up.

52:08.600 --> 52:10.640
You're not here for me.

52:10.640 --> 52:11.640
Let's talk about you.

52:11.640 --> 52:12.640
Can I ask a question?

52:12.640 --> 52:18.240
I'm fascinated about, we talked briefly that you left corporate, can we ask what the corporate

52:18.240 --> 52:19.240
gig was?

52:19.240 --> 52:20.240
What were you doing before?

52:20.240 --> 52:21.240
You founded Tesla.

52:21.240 --> 52:22.240
Whoa.

52:22.240 --> 52:27.240
No, I was an executive assistant to the CIO of my company.

52:27.240 --> 52:28.880
That's all I was doing.

52:28.880 --> 52:32.000
I needed a corporate job that had a decent paycheck.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.160
What kind of job, was it like tech or something like that?

52:35.160 --> 52:36.160
Oh, yeah.

52:36.160 --> 52:39.440
It was an IT department for a commercial real estate company.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.440
And then you started podcasting about true crime.

52:41.440 --> 52:43.800
Was it your first podcast or was it your first foray into it?

52:43.800 --> 52:44.800
Yeah.

52:44.800 --> 52:48.760
I mean, I'd just been writing for a long time and it wasn't really paying off as well as

52:48.760 --> 52:49.760
I'd liked.

52:49.760 --> 52:53.160
I just figured I just needed a way to distribute my work so that I could get it in front of

52:53.160 --> 52:54.400
a lot of people.

52:54.400 --> 52:56.200
And podcasting was just the natural way to go.

52:56.200 --> 52:57.360
I mean, there are other factors involved.

52:57.360 --> 53:03.880
And it went so well that you could say goodbye to your Santa Monica West Side corporate

53:03.880 --> 53:07.280
job that paid probably pretty well.

53:07.280 --> 53:10.760
And then you can just go, fuck it, I'm leaving to Arizona and I'm just going to make people

53:10.760 --> 53:12.480
on the internet mad about murders.

53:12.480 --> 53:14.840
Yeah, pretty much.

53:14.840 --> 53:15.840
That's the way it went.

53:15.840 --> 53:16.840
Yeah.

53:16.840 --> 53:19.800
I mean, they just followed your own weird joy on that one and just said, this is what

53:19.800 --> 53:20.800
I want to do.

53:20.800 --> 53:21.800
Oh, totally.

53:21.800 --> 53:22.800
Yeah.

53:22.800 --> 53:23.800
I mean, I just worked nonstop.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.640
And it was like, I got to a point where I was exhausted and I was like, that has to

53:25.640 --> 53:26.920
be one thing or the other.

53:26.920 --> 53:28.440
And I wanted it to be the creative side.

53:28.440 --> 53:29.920
That's so cool.

53:29.920 --> 53:32.360
That's just inspirationally awesome.

53:32.360 --> 53:33.360
Yeah.

53:33.360 --> 53:35.960
I mean, that's off to that.

53:35.960 --> 53:41.960
And everyone listening to that, just do the thing that you're obsessed about.

53:41.960 --> 53:46.640
That's the bright side of a shitty dehumanizing internet is that it should be providing.

53:46.640 --> 53:47.640
Yeah.

53:47.640 --> 53:48.640
That's what I love about it.

53:48.640 --> 53:53.520
As I said to What's His Fuck, I'm going to ask the episode, What's His Fuck, Doctor

53:53.520 --> 53:54.520
What's His Fuck.

53:54.520 --> 53:56.640
Oh, the What's His Guy, overheard LA.

53:56.640 --> 53:59.880
I'm like, I love the internet.

53:59.880 --> 54:06.320
For all of its stories about how it destroys people with its fucking acidic dehumanization,

54:06.320 --> 54:14.520
it's also like, yeah, but before it existed, you couldn't just go, tell me one more time

54:14.520 --> 54:18.400
to reload this paper tray, you piece of shit.

54:18.400 --> 54:22.880
I'm going to go home, grab a Yeti mic from Best Buy.

54:22.880 --> 54:23.880
That's what Mike I have too.

54:23.880 --> 54:24.880
Hell yeah.

54:24.880 --> 54:25.880
Hell yeah.

54:25.880 --> 54:28.160
I can't figure out how to make those things work.

54:28.160 --> 54:30.440
They're a lot better than these ones.

54:30.440 --> 54:33.640
They're not better, but they have a, you could talk a lot farther away.

54:33.640 --> 54:37.480
You can just like, and it's not about like, oh, you're either Mozart or you don't know

54:37.480 --> 54:38.760
how to play piano.

54:38.760 --> 54:44.120
I like the depth of that hierarchy and the birth of that circular system where it's like,

54:44.120 --> 54:53.760
really, you don't know who, maybe the reason I was born is because I'm neither, I'm just

54:53.760 --> 54:54.760
me.

54:54.760 --> 54:55.760
I love that.

54:55.760 --> 55:01.160
That people go like, yes, she's just her, and then we praise these stories and go, she

55:01.160 --> 55:02.160
was just her.

55:02.160 --> 55:05.280
No, she's a billionaire, and then we ruin that person.

55:05.280 --> 55:10.400
But I like that idea of that ever-widening marketplace where it's like, you can just

55:10.400 --> 55:17.720
be you, and then we, you know, well, YouTube, we all need someone while we're just being

55:17.720 --> 55:23.080
us to, I don't know, drill the oil and stuff, but we'll go out to other countries for that.

55:23.080 --> 55:27.000
When podcasting first came around, like I was, you know, I'm the old buddy that is like,

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
what's a blog?

55:28.000 --> 55:33.320
It was a combination of two words, it's stupid, and what's a podcast, it's dumb, and of course

55:33.320 --> 55:38.760
I've been doing a podcast for a thousand years, but like, there is kind of a little

55:38.760 --> 55:43.800
art movement to it where people just like, there's little pockets of humanity, it could

55:43.800 --> 55:47.440
be anywhere in the world, it doesn't have to be in New York or, you know, Hollywood,

55:47.440 --> 55:52.360
and just sit down and just talk about stuff, and people fall in love with it, and that's

55:52.360 --> 55:58.880
closer to like, 60s and 70s punk rock in New York, like people just going, I'm not a great

55:58.880 --> 56:03.200
guitar player, I just know I want to go into these shitty little clubs and just scream into

56:03.200 --> 56:04.200
a microphone.

56:04.200 --> 56:08.320
Now, I don't want to be this guy.

56:08.320 --> 56:11.120
But if you did, it would go a little something, like this.

56:11.120 --> 56:15.880
Said the guy who didn't want to be that guy, never.

56:15.880 --> 56:19.680
On steroids.

56:19.680 --> 56:23.640
But we should, I really want to, here's what I want to do.

56:23.640 --> 56:28.880
I want to send Ryan out of the room, stage a murder.

56:28.880 --> 56:29.880
Okay.

56:29.880 --> 56:30.880
Why stage it?

56:30.880 --> 56:38.280
Well, not stage a murder, but like, have a truth that we know and that you don't know

56:38.280 --> 56:44.600
have you come back, and just like, I don't know, kind of have you examine it.

56:44.600 --> 56:45.600
Right.

56:45.600 --> 56:50.600
It's not to test you, it's just to like, okay, how about this, how about this, I'll take

56:50.600 --> 56:55.000
Ryan into the green room, we'll cover our ears, and then have like, leave here, somebody

56:55.000 --> 57:00.120
come get us, but I'll be like your, oh, you want me in on the job?

57:00.120 --> 57:03.280
Yeah, have someone else cover his ears, we have people for that.

57:03.280 --> 57:06.000
We did build that sound group.

57:06.000 --> 57:12.040
In my mind, I would be like the shitty local detective who brought in the fancy podcast

57:12.040 --> 57:13.040
profiler.

57:13.040 --> 57:14.040
Okay, you're okay.

57:14.040 --> 57:15.040
All right.

57:15.040 --> 57:18.520
I'm using just my regular cop training, but he's got the superpower.

57:18.520 --> 57:21.920
All right, but then what are Spencer and I left doing, like one of us murders the other,

57:21.920 --> 57:25.080
and I just want to figure out like,

57:25.080 --> 57:28.080
Well, what we can, that's the hardest part is fine, like, how are we going to come up

57:28.080 --> 57:29.080
with a crime?

57:29.080 --> 57:32.400
All we need to do is decide on something conversationally.

57:32.400 --> 57:33.400
Decide on what?

57:33.400 --> 57:40.480
Well, like, we decide like, what happened, and then we decide who did it.

57:40.480 --> 57:41.480
That's all very difficult.

57:41.480 --> 57:42.480
It is hard.

57:42.480 --> 57:43.480
It's hard.

57:43.480 --> 57:44.480
Yeah, okay, we could do it though.

57:44.480 --> 57:48.160
But we can do it, but then once we know the truth, then definitively we'll be lying.

57:48.160 --> 57:51.280
Well, how about, is anybody in our audience, has anyone actually committed a murder that

57:51.280 --> 57:52.280
has not been told yet?

57:52.280 --> 57:53.280
I want to do it.

57:53.280 --> 57:54.280
Yeah, please tell me.

57:54.280 --> 57:55.280
Who is it?

57:55.280 --> 57:56.280
Wait, wait, we can figure this out.

57:56.280 --> 57:57.280
We can figure this out.

57:57.280 --> 57:58.280
Yeah.

57:58.280 --> 57:59.280
Do you want it?

57:59.280 --> 58:00.280
Yeah.

58:00.280 --> 58:02.040
Yeah, using someone from the audience is a good idea.

58:02.040 --> 58:06.440
I like that start, but like, we can't murder people.

58:06.440 --> 58:08.960
Well, let's not rule that out just yet.

58:08.960 --> 58:09.960
I don't want them to murder you.

58:09.960 --> 58:10.960
We need all options on the table.

58:10.960 --> 58:11.960
But like, ah, fuck.

58:11.960 --> 58:12.960
You can't murder the audience.

58:12.960 --> 58:13.960
I don't know.

58:13.960 --> 58:14.960
You don't have any suggestions.

58:14.960 --> 58:15.960
We don't know that.

58:15.960 --> 58:19.640
Like, how does redirection of late work backwards where you could be like, you know, what would

58:19.640 --> 58:20.640
make you?

58:20.640 --> 58:21.640
What about this?

58:21.640 --> 58:26.160
Does anybody, because when you watch these, you know, these murder shows and or listen

58:26.160 --> 58:30.240
to the true crime podcast kind of things, do you ever kind of fantasize like, I think

58:30.240 --> 58:35.200
I have the perfect crime, or if I wanted to like do somebody, this is how I think I would

58:35.200 --> 58:36.200
get away with it.

58:36.200 --> 58:40.240
If anybody, does anybody have one now, because like, because I've got like five.

58:40.240 --> 58:44.520
Yeah, but that's, if you have a good one, you never want to share it out loud, especially

58:44.520 --> 58:46.760
on a recording.

58:46.760 --> 58:48.600
That's like rule number one of my plan.

58:48.600 --> 58:52.200
Yeah, but this would be a great way, this would be a great way to expiate that and go

58:52.200 --> 58:56.160
like, I could never do that now, because I've said it on one of the world's most famous

58:56.160 --> 58:57.160
podcasts.

58:57.160 --> 59:01.200
And actually what we could do is an improvement on our 911 call thing, but the thing that

59:01.200 --> 59:07.280
we did wrong last time is the ladies were in the room and then we, if we send you guys

59:07.280 --> 59:14.880
out of the room and then Spencer and I, we decide on a scenario and then we, we bring

59:14.880 --> 59:20.280
you guys back in and we make our 911 calls based on what we know is the truth.

59:20.280 --> 59:21.280
Yeah.

59:21.280 --> 59:22.280
Yeah.

59:22.280 --> 59:23.280
I like that.

59:23.280 --> 59:24.280
I think I'm close there.

59:24.280 --> 59:25.280
Yeah.

59:25.280 --> 59:26.280
Yeah, that's good.

59:26.280 --> 59:27.280
No, no.

59:27.280 --> 59:28.280
Yes.

59:28.280 --> 59:34.960
I got to go back and do a little, honestly, I think you can stay for this version.

59:34.960 --> 59:35.960
Okay.

59:35.960 --> 59:36.960
He doesn't need his ears.

59:36.960 --> 59:40.680
I was just saying that like, like I'm the shitty cop, I'm the local, you know, knucklehead

59:40.680 --> 59:42.180
detective from Colorado Springs.

59:42.180 --> 59:44.920
I think we can give him a choice of three 911 calls.

59:44.920 --> 59:50.160
If he covers his ears, leaves the room and then comes back in and we've decided on what

59:50.160 --> 59:54.960
really happened because then we'll have a truth in our head and then we make a 911 call.

59:54.960 --> 59:55.960
We're all making 911 calls?

59:55.960 --> 59:56.960
Yeah.

59:56.960 --> 59:57.960
Oh right.

59:57.960 --> 59:58.960
We're all covering up the same crime.

59:58.960 --> 59:59.960
Yep.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:00.960
I got you.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.960
That's what we did wrong last time.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:02.960
I have no idea.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.960
Because we were making up crime.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.960
That's for the best.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.960
You know, Steve Levy is a wonderful conversationalist.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.960
He'll take you in the alley.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:07.960
He'll chat you up.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.960
It'll be grand.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:09.960
Steve Levy.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.960
Can you come out here please?

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.960
Levy to the stage.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.960
Oh, what are you saying?

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:13.960
I'm getting set up to get murdered.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.960
What's that?

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.960
Am I getting set up to get murdered here?

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.960
Yeah.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.480
It'd be the perfect crime because we'd be like, I don't know what happened to him.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.960
We were talking about murder and then he never came back.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.960
By the way, back alley code seven.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.960
What if this is the perfect crime?

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.960
We wouldn't be recording it.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.960
No, we would be because we'd be recording it and it sounds so guileless.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.960
Even what I'm doing right now, which is getting like meta and like laying layers onto it.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:38.960
I don't know.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.960
This is a couple of guiles to me.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.960
This is where we find out, by the way, that Steve during the show has been murdered.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.700
Well, no, this is when he lives his real life.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.960
He goes to Newark and like does coke and shit.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.960
Or he fights crime where he's out there murdering people.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:52.960
Yeah.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:53.960
He's like Nightwing.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:54.960
He's never...

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.960
Oh, that's what he does.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.960
He comes out to bring the vodka that nobody asked to create an alibi.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.960
It's an alibi.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:01.960
Yeah.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960
Meanwhile.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.960
And then he goes and fucking does a show with Bet Midler.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.960
Yes.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.960
He's the MacArthur Park handjobber.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.960
Are you comfortable with this?

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.960
He's the MacArthur Park handjobber.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.960
The least sought after criminal.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.960
Like no one wants him caught.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:17.960
Or her.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:18.960
We don't know.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.960
Let's see.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.960
I mean, here's the problem.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.960
People say Victor was crying, but it's just too vigorous.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.960
It's kind of like a blow.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.960
It's like fucking at least, you know...

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.960
The MacArthur Park handjobber.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.960
Criminal or Samaritan.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.960
Or yeah.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.960
Tonight at 11.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.960
Like they...

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.960
And I said, like you just have like college kids going like, a guy came out or a lady,

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.960
I don't know.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.960
You know, like a satin glove on, they said, do you want a handjob?

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.960
I said, no, they left.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:53.960
I was in MacArthur Park.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.960
I like the ducks.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.960
Okay.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.960
So I just have...

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.960
People are asking, are they a criminal?

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.960
And then someone else is like, I said, yes, best handjob of my life.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.960
Like no one can figure out, should we catch this person?

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.960
Or should we all be them?

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960
I just...

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.960
So I think, well, are we all covering up the crime or is one of us covering up the crime

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.960
and the other two are being honest?

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.960
I think somebody should go, oh, like my loved one was attacked.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.960
Well, we'll all say that.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960
Yeah, that could be the murder.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.960
I think what we need to do is, and don't leave yet, so let's figure this out.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:32.960
So the idea is we would send Ryan out and then we would decide while he's out on a...

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.960
On the specifics of a crime, I guess.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960
Right.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960
This is where it all falls apart.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.960
No, no, that part I guess.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.960
It's already falling apart.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.960
Well, that's to be sure.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:44.960
And then he would come in and we would basically do our 911 calls.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.960
Right.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:46.960
I don't know.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.960
But are we all guilty?

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.960
Because then he'd just say, yeah, you're all guilty.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.960
Or is one of us guilty?

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.960
I'd say...

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.960
Oh, no, no.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:54.960
Only one of us is guilty.

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.960
Right, okay.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.960
If one or two people are guilty.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:57.960
It could be only one person.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.960
It could be two people.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:59.960
It has to be one person.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.960
And then we see if he can pick the guilty person.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.960
You should pick an actual victim here and just have somebody leave the room.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.960
Right.

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.960
I'll try to figure out who it is.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.960
The audience member has to leave.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.960
They can't see the rest of the show.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.960
Okay.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.960
Just for a minute.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960
How about this?

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.960
How about this?

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.960
The four of us stay here and the whole audience leaves.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.960
You give me an hour.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.960
We could do just that.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.960
Can we try?

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.960
I feel like the audience would be frustrated if we don't just try it.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:24.960
Yeah.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.960
Okay.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.960
Ryan, get out of here.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.960
We're going to try it.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.960
Thanks so much.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960
Steve Levy doesn't exist.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:35.960
Go backstage and plug your ears and we'll call you unplug your ears.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.960
Honor system Ryan.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.960
Plug your ears and say la la la.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.960
And even if this doesn't work, it's just another...

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960
Steve, turn down the monitor.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.960
All right.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:43.960
The one in the back.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960
Not these ones.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.960
These are good.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.960
He doesn't exist or he would have come up here by now.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.960
I'm going to go check in the back of the show.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.960
Steve loves smoking.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.960
All right.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.960
So how this would work is we would decide on a crime that happened, right?

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.960
There's a dead baby.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:58.960
A dead baby.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.960
In a bucket.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:00.960
Okay.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.960
Can it be a four-year-old?

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.960
Sorry.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:06.960
Sorry.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.960
It has to be a four-year-old.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.960
Okay.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:09.960
Great.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.960
So it's a dead four-year-old in a bucket.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.960
Uh-huh.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.960
By a river.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.960
Right.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.960
And either we found it or we killed it.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.960
Right.

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.960
Is it working, Jeff?

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.960
To talk a little longer.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.960
Okay.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.960
All right.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.960
All right.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:21.960
Let's just...

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.960
We could...

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:23.960
What?

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.960
That's fair.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.960
You know.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:26.960
We're going to...

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.960
It's going to have to be a...

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.960
Just don't eat the mic.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.960
Okay.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:30.960
All right.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.960
So we were talking about it's a dead baby.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.960
Huh?

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.960
Either we found it or we...

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:35.960
Right.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.960
Or we're the reason it's there.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:37.960
Right.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:38.960
Now it's too quiet.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.960
I couldn't hear what you said.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.960
When you kill a person...

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.960
Right.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.960
Usually, like, you either found it.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.960
It's kind of whoever smelled it dealt it.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.960
Like, you're either the person that finds the body.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.960
All right.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.960
So who's going to be guilty?

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.960
Okay.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.960
Don't say it on the mic.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.960
Just let's raise hands.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.960
Okay.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.960
Well, we need to pick...

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.960
Someone from the audience come up and pick.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:01.960
Okay.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.960
You want to come up and pick whoever's going to be the murderer.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.960
Right.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:05.960
Come on up.

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:06.960
Okay.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960
So that's a...

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.960
It's not an audible process.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.960
All right.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.960
And if you have anything to plug, we'll also...

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.960
A SoundCloud or anything?

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.960
Okay.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.960
You deserve...

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:17.960
You deserve something.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:18.960
Okay.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.960
So you're going to pick the person that's the murderer.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.960
And we're not going to acknowledge it audibly.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960
Right.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:24.960
So it's...

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.960
They're in the bucket.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.960
And it's okay that the audience knows.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.960
We just want to make sure that our...

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.960
Asperger detective doesn't know.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.960
Okay.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960
So the...

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.960
Yeah.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.960
So murder has been chosen.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.960
Our show feels so classy now.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:40.960
Thank you.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:41.960
But he was like, wait, wait.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:42.960
Don't tell me.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.960
Like this...

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.960
It's really like...

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960
All right.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.960
A polite applause.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.960
All right.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.960
One of us, someone in this room, is a murderer.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.960
We have to do more games.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960
What's the crime?

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960
What's the crime?

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.960
The crime is there's a baby in a bucket.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960
All right.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.960
It's four years old.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.960
It's been killed and placed in a bucket.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.960
Fuck.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.960
This isn't going to work.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.960
No, it'll work.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.960
It'll work.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960
What?

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.960
Well, we're going to be interrogated.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.960
Well, no.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.960
Well, my theory is we're calling 911, right?

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.960
Like we're each calling 911?

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.960
Sure.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.960
Or is that not...

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:16.960
No, that works.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.960
Why would three people all call 911?

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.960
We each found a baby in a bucket.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.960
Because we're trying to get away with it.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.960
Two of us are the people that found the baby in the bucket.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.960
Right.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.960
We're just going to kill the baby in the bucket.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.960
Okay.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.960
Why would that person call 911?

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.960
To smoke screen.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.960
Okay.

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.960
Right.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.960
Because otherwise they'd just leave the baby to be found.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:37.960
Okay, let's just keep it simple.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.960
Let's just try it very simple.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.960
So a couple more facts.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.960
Do we just want a couple more facts?

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.960
Okay, it does work.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.960
All right.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.960
Is the baby in a bucket?

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.960
One of us did it.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.960
And we're all going to call up for various reasons and say, oh Jesus Christ, baby in a bucket.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:48.960
Yeah.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.960
I mean, I already know this isn't going to work.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.960
No, it'll work enough.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.960
No, but here's the thing.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.960
The way that he's going to be helpful in this, and we're going to show off Ryan's skill set,

01:06:58.960 --> 01:06:59.960
is that-

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:00.960
He's going to ask us details.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.960
Yeah.

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.960
But we're all going to be making them up.

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:04.960
And that's why it doesn't work.

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:05.960
That's why it doesn't work.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:06.960
Well, no.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.960
I mean, I think it'll be good.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:09.960
Right.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:14.960
They're just, we need, let's just say like two kind of facts that are clues that we could kind of all-

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.960
I think we need to agree on a redirection of light point.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.960
That's the thing is we want him to detect where the redirection of light happened.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.960
Right.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.960
Like we actually need to actually, like we need to know that you guys, I don't know.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.960
No, just a couple.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960
Okay.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.960
So he's in a bucket.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.960
It was by the river.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.960
He was playing, right?

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.960
Those are things we've learned.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960
Okay.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.960
So just establish two more facts.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:37.960
The baby was wealthy.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:38.960
Right.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.960
Okay.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.960
Great.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:41.960
He was an heir to the kingdom of Brunna.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:42.960
Okay.

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:43.960
Okay.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:44.960
I think I understand this.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:45.960
And I hope he's not listening.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.960
I hope he's not listening, but I, because I need to explain this like loudly and-

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.960
Gotcha.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.960
Like basically we're all the same person.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:52.880
Right.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.880
But that makes sense.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:54.880
Yeah.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:59.360
And so, but like there are two versions of us are innocent.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.360
Right.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.000
And one version of us is guilty.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.880
So what we need to decide on is what actually happened.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.880
Okay.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.880
That's what I was saying.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:08.880
Oh, yeah.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:09.880
No, no, sorry.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:10.880
I'm not trying to-

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.880
Well, I don't listen to other people.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:12.880
That's not-

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.880
Susie your pants.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.880
No, no, it's good.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.880
But okay.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:16.880
All right.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.880
I'm glad you were saying that then.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.880
Okay.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880
I'm sorry.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.880
All right.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.880
The details only-

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.880
The non-murder timeline.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.880
Why?

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.880
How did the baby end up in the-

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:28.880
If the baby ended up in the bucket and we didn't kill it, here-

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.880
Okay.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.880
Let's agree on what happened.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.880
Right.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.880
Or-

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:38.120
Or did the two people that didn't kill the baby leave the room, too, and only the

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.880
person that killed the baby knows the actual story-

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:40.880
Right.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.880
So no one actually knows what happened.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.880
So wait.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.880
Is that too complicated?

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.880
No, no, that's great.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.880
Oh, that is good.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.880
So who killed-

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.480
Again, we're all going to leave the room at one point.

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.480
Okay, so what if- what if the coloring book was still in the car?

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.480
Wait.

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.480
We're just- these are just clues.

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.480
Doesn't the-

01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.480
Aren't we supposed to leave-

01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:59.480
Who- who- wait, I thought- did you-

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.480
These are clues.

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.480
These are-

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.480
Right.

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.480
No, no, let's say that's for instance, but that's not going to be the one that we do.

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.480
Okay.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:06.480
Can you come back up and point again?

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.480
All right.

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.480
How about this?

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.480
Church.

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.480
Give Spencer-

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.480
Oh, shit.

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480
What?

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:18.480
Come up and give Spencer some clues.

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.480
Wait.

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:20.480
Why do you give clues?

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.480
It's not-

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.480
I know.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.480
There's going to be details.

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.480
There needs to be- there needs to be one truth for the people that didn't kill the baby,

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:28.480
and one- and then the other person needs to be like, making it up.

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:29.480
Well, let's just- let's just try it.

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.480
Let's just do alibis now.

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:33.480
I think we should stick with a coloring book in the car.

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.480
Okay.

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.480
If we want one more-

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.480
There's a coloring book in the car.

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.480
Yeah.

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.480
Okay, all right.

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.480
But we all know that.

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.480
All right.

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:41.480
Yes.

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.480
Okay.

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.480
Okay.

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.480
Okay.

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.480
Okay.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:51.480
One more is the car- where does the car park tell about?

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.480
By the river.

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480
Great.

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.480
By the river.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.480
And so we're all going to be calling in separately for different reasons.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.480
And we're all- two of us because we found a baby in a bucket.

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.480
Okay.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.480
And one of us because we killed the baby and put it in a bucket.

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.480
Right.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.480
This doesn't work.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.480
And does everyone know- does everyone know who killed the baby?

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.480
I don't.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.480
Well, you guys don't.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.480
Yeah, so can you come back up and point at the person again?

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.480
Okay.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.480
All right.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.480
All right.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:25.480
So everyone in the audience, he just pointed at Dan, Jeff, and Spencer.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:29.480
All of our reason to be a subscriber to the live feed.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.480
You will know right now who this is.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:35.480
I mean, I'm not saying we're making a mistake.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.480
I just want to get better at this.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.480
One thing happened that made everything fall apart.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.480
And otherwise it was going great.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.480
I don't want to reveal what that thing was.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.480
Hopefully you make it through your surgery and I want to retune this and like-

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.480
Hopefully I die.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.480
I want to do nothing but have-

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.480
And then we can call 911 about me dying on the operating table.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.480
I don't know what happened.

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.480
I found his head in a bucket.

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:58.480
I guess his surgery.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480
All right.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480
Okay.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.480
So what's the- how do we- how do we go ABC through this now?

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.480
So we want another audience member to pick who should go first then.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.480
I go first.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.480
Someone just said Jeff.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.480
Did you hear- okay.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.480
Did you hear what happened?

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.480
No.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.480
That sounds like a low idea.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.480
He's redirecting like this son of a bitch.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.480
Yeah.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.480
How much did you hear back to anything at all?

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.480
Nothing.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.480
All right.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.480
That's perfect.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.480
I'll tell you Ryan, not a whole lot happened down here.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.480
A lot of confusion.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.480
Yeah.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.480
I was actually- no, no.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.480
It was good.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.480
A lot of that could have happened with you on stage,

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.480
but otherwise it was good.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:41.480
All right, so the premise is three of us are- we're all going to give you a 911 call about

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:46.480
a murder that has happened, and then you're going to pick who of us is based on your

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.480
own- you can bring us into the questioning room.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.480
You can do whatever you want.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.480
Your Michael checklists of your own shield.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.480
You can do whatever you want at here.

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480
All right.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.480
I go first.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.480
911.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.480
Hello?

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:11.480
That's already- I mean, I'm saying- who's dispatch?

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.480
Who's dispatch?

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.480
Oh, well, we need somebody.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:16.480
You've done it.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.480
You deserve more.

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.480
Thank you.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.480
Can you be dispatch?

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.480
Great.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.480
That's the part I knew.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.480
This is going to be great for everybody.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.480
Can you be 911 dispatch?

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.480
All right.

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.480
Generally, the job entails telling anyone that has an emergency to calm down.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.480
All right.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.480
I'm aware.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.480
Just hang up on him.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.480
All right.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.480
Just hang up.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.480
All right.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.480
So I dial 911.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.480
I'm dispatcher.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.480
Yeah.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.480
Yeah.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.480
Yeah.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.480
Now you say 911.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.480
What did you say?

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.480
What's your emergency?

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.480
You're the answer.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.480
Yeah.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.480
I was waiting for a ring.

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.480
911 dispatch.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.480
Hi.

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.480
My name is-

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.480
Sir?

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.480
Yes?

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.480
Calm down, please.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.480
Calm down.

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.480
Promoted.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:05.480
I need you to calm down, please calm down.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.480
My name is Jake Sweetwater.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.480
I live at 145 Mercury Lane.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.480
Okay, sir.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.480
I need to figure out what's going on right now.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.480
I think I've found the remains of a small child.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.480
It's in the Sweetwater River.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.480
And it's not named after me.

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.480
Strangely.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.480
Sir?

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.480
Sir?

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.480
I mean, my family moved here because we thought it was funny.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:35.480
So you're acting very suspicious right now.

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.480
Okay.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.480
I still don't know about what's going on.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.480
The remains.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.480
Let's start with the remains.

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:48.480
Near my farm by the old well, there seems to be a painter's bucket, which looks like

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:52.480
the remains of a small child and-

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.480
Is this your child or just a child?

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.480
I don't have a child, sadly.

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.480
Well, that should have been one of the factors.

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.480
Funny you should ask.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.480
My wife can't conceive.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.480
But neither here nor there.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.480
Sir, I'm just saying that we should get-

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.480
We're learning.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:10.480
Whatever you guys do at 911, incorporate it.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.480
You guys should bring down.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:17.480
I'm pretty certain these are young baby remains in a painter's bucket.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.480
Okay.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.480
Sir, I need more details.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.480
I gave you my address.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.480
I told you my name.

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.480
I'm a single father.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.480
When did you find these remains?

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480
Just now.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.480
No, I waited three days to tell you.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.480
What were you doing?

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.480
I shot the bucket and my wife and I said,

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.480
Fuck, it's going to Cancun.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.480
And then we'll come back.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:43.480
Look, I'm telling you that I found what looks to be some decomposing remains of a small

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.480
child.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.480
And the end, here's my name and address.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.480
Sir, I need you to calm down.

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.480
Sir, I need you to calm down.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:56.480
I think your lack of commitment to your job is more criminal than what led to a baby.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.480
How long dead?

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.480
I don't know who am I, the coroner?

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.480
I'm not the medical examiner here.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.480
I'm going to figure out who I need to send.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.480
I don't know if I need to send a fire truck.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.480
I would send police.

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.480
I would send a medical team.

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.480
Sir.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.480
Yes.

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.480
Calm down, please.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:12.480
Okay.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.480
Don't gender specify me.

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.480
Whoa.

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.480
That's the cops.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:20.480
We'll have someone out on the way.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.480
Thank you.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.480
Wouldn't that be nice?

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.480
I got a baby in a bucket over here.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.480
Where's somebody?

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.480
Sir, don't move the bucket.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.480
Okay.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.480
I'm not touching the bucket.

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.480
I'm just letting you know.

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.480
You don't touch the bucket with the baby.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480
It's an active crime scene now.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.480
Look, hey man, I watch a lot of TV.

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.480
If you see a baby in a bucket, what am I going to do?

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.480
Touch the bucket?

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.480
No, then I'm the guy that put the baby in the bucket.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.480
There's a lot of things you can do with the baby.

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.480
I don't know you, sir.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.480
I think you're overstepping your fucking bailiwick right now.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.480
You should just get the police down here.

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.480
Ma'am, drop the bucket.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.480
I'm not a...

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.480
I'm not a ma'am.

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.480
Yeah.

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.480
You says you.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.480
Drop the bucket.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.480
I'm not...

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.480
I'm not holding the bucket.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.480
Open fire.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.480
Open fire.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.480
Hello, Natalie?

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.480
Natalie?

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.480
Yes.

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:13.480
Can you find the main frame where everything's recorded?

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.480
And delete most of it?

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.480
Give me a few minutes.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480
No, I went too far.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.480
I went too far.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.480
Don't affect the cannon.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.480
Okay, so that was my 9-1-1 call to dispatch.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.480
I think next time we do this game.

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.480
All right.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.480
It's not a good game.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.480
You matter my hair.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.480
Who goes second?

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.480
Dan or Spencer?

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:32.480
I think next time we might actually nail it.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.480
Spencer.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.480
I'd like to...

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.480
That's what's keeping the gun out of my mouth.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.480
Is that we're making steps.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:41.480
And all these members randomly chosen Spencer to go second at the 9-1-1 call.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:42.480
Okay.

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:47.480
Now the question is how familiar is Spencer with my 9-1-1 call?

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:54.780
See, that's what we debugged is that we had to establish all common facts about the relationship

01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:56.480
with the baby.

01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:57.480
Okay.

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:04.480
Beat, boop, beat, beat, beat, boop, beat, boop, boop, boop, boop.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.480
Sir, sir, please stop pressing buttons.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.480
It's 300 letters.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.480
I just pressed 9-1-1, 9-1-1.

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.480
There's only three numbers, sir.

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.480
Hi.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.480
My name's Carl Sweetwater.

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:19.480
I live on the Sweetwater Farm next to the Sweetwater River.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.480
I'm so sorry to bother you.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:22.480
I have a situation.

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.480
I can't believe it.

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.480
I was just babysitting my baby niece, my four-year-old niece down by the river.

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.480
We drove down by the river.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.480
Sir, sir, sir, I need you to calm down.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.480
Okay.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.480
Did you happen to have a bucket with you?

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.480
How did you know?

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:42.480
Let me let me do some breathing exercises.

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.480
Okay.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.480
So we were playing with sand in the bucket.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.480
Okay.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.480
And I went back to my car because they left their coloring book in the car.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.480
Okay.

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.480
She did, not they.

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:53.480
Oh, okay.

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:58.480
And so when I when I came back with the coloring book, I just see the kid face down, head in

01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.480
the bucket, not breathing.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.480
I tried to resuscitate her.

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.480
It didn't work.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.480
I was too late.

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.480
Sir, sir, let me ask you this.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.480
Is CPR certified?

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.480
No.

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.480
And I, but you know, you just panic.

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.480
Okay.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:15.480
Do you have any other relatives that you know of that may have been in under the Sweetwater

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.480
name?

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.480
Oh, yeah.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:24.960
Owner of the Sweetwater brand of electronic companies.

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.480
Why is that relevant?

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.400
Can you send someone?

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.400
It's a slow day.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.480
It's only me here.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.480
So I've taken a lot of calls in.

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.480
Oh, I've been there.

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:37.400
I've got I've received a call.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.480
You may want to check the river.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.480
Well for what?

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:45.280
Oh boy, I think I got a dead kid.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.280
I'm so.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.280
I just I don't know.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.280
I'm so sorry.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:51.680
I can't believe I fucked up.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.680
It was just.

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.680
It was just in a minute.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:54.680
We will send someone in.

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.680
We will send someone over.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.680
Please.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:59.480
Can you ask them to not shoot me?

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:09.480
Sweetwater farm has a history ma'am put the bucket down this bucket in my hands to open

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:10.480
fire.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.480
Oh no.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.480
All right.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.480
Put some coke.

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:17.480
I can call the chief see that's that's what you were.

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:21.480
When you were telling the story Jeff, I was like oh well I was going to tell a story about

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:22.480
being related to this kid.

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.480
You're just finding a dead kid that you never knew about.

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.480
So like that.

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.680
And for the game that would have been good to establish.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:33.480
Should I have not like mentioned any sort of relation?

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.480
You're doing great.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.480
I know.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:39.480
I think where we are right now is just as confusing as most first first four hours of

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:40.480
any investigation.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.480
No, it's good.

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.480
I like it.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.480
It's not.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.480
All right.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.480
Now it's Danster.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.480
All right.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.480
So now I like this.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:48.480
Dan Dan has to call 911.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.480
All right.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.480
Beep.

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.480
Beep.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.480
Beep.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.480
Beep.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:54.480
Beep.

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:55.480
Beep.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.480
Beep.

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.480
Beep.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.480
There is just silence in the background.

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:05.480
I'm having a hard time hearing you.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.480
Oh Fuck.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.480
Shit.

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.480
Hello 911.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.480
Sir, yes.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.480
Yeah.

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.480
Oh my god.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:12.480
There's a baby in a bucket.

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.480
Oh, okay.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.480
I found a baby in a bucket.

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:15.480
Okay.

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.480
Let me let me get your all the time it's happened to you tonight.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.480
Sir, I needed to calm down.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.480
My name is my name is Carl suite water.

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.480
I'm like I'm.

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:28.360
Sir, I need you to calm down.

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.360
I need you to calm down.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.480
I know you need me to calm down, but the thing is the truth is...

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.480
Is this your baby?

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.480
God, no.

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:37.480
Why would I have a baby in a bucket?

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:40.480
Sir, or maybe ma'am, I don't know you.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.480
Thank you.

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.480
I'm not familiar or I'm not sure what your pronoun is.

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.480
That's really cool of you.

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.480
Thank you.

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:46.480
You're welcome.

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:49.400
I actually, during college, I actually was...

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:55.400
I did go through a phase where I identified as non-binary.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.400
Thank you.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.400
Thank you.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.400
I just found a baby in a bucket.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.400
I'm a man now.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.400
I'm a book man.

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:07.400
I've got to fucking cock the size of a Lincoln log and I'm like ready to rock.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.400
Like I'm through that forest and I don't think that's necessarily...

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.120
I don't think that makes me a hero.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:19.360
So sir, judging by that, that lesson, you identify as a man and this is not your child.

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.360
You're right.

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.360
No, absolutely not.

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.360
How did you find it?

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360
Not because of...

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.360
I found it in a bucket.

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.360
I'm not going to call it that.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.360
My car broke down.

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:33.560
I ran out of radiator cap and it started steaming and I hit a tree and I was like, I'm going

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.040
to breath a fresh air.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.360
Think about where my life's gone.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.960
I've changed my gender.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.160
I've changed my field of expertise.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.960
I've gone from video to audio.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:51.960
I used to be a woman that was into HD and then I became a man that was into audio.

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:57.400
I was just finding my place so I hit this tree.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:02.880
I'm on a bunch of ketamine and I'm breathing and I see this bucket and I'm like, what's

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.520
in there?

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:05.520
I see something gleaming.

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.200
I'm like, are those teeth?

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.360
Turns out, yeah.

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.120
I'm like, why are they so...

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:17.480
Sir, I'd like to let you know this entire call is being recorded.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.800
Oh, fuck.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.920
I'm going to prison.

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.640
It's not because I killed my baby.

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.920
It's because of my past and I'm going to make...

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:26.920
You're fine.

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:27.920
I'm not fine.

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:28.920
All right.

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:29.920
So we have our 3911 calls.

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.920
I'm not fine.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.920
No, no.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:32.920
Do we all get separately?

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:33.920
Oh!

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.920
Put the bucket down.

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:41.040
No, no cops showed up.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:43.400
Now does Ryan interview us?

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:51.600
Also, I think the murderer might be the night moment dispatcher because the lack of effort

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:56.960
put into helping this baby or solving these calls every day just feels like it's just

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.960
another...

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.400
It's old hat to you, but meanwhile, there's three people that have a baby.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.400
It's not...

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.400
Yeah, they're all under the Sweetwater name and everyone's very suspicious.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:06.200
I think a major clue is that two of the Sweetwaters were named Carl.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.360
Thank you.

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.200
Both of you were Carl Sweetwater.

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:13.000
We should have established the person and all been the same person.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Oh, okay.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
It's fine.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
We're workshopping.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.520
We're going to get better at it, but in the meantime, do you think you know who killed

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.520
the baby?

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.520
No.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.520
But...

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.520
Yeah.

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:27.880
Well, let's see.

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.400
Perfect crime.

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:33.880
I bet he's analyzing the psychology and it all seems like people are just making a bunch

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.880
of shit up.

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.880
Yeah.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:41.160
Well, Jeff lied about where you contradicted yourself.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.320
You said you had a child and then you said you didn't.

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.320
I did?

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.320
Yeah.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.320
Oh.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:50.320
I was in shock.

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.320
Very suspicious.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:55.920
Do you see a baby in a bucket every day?

01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:03.320
I'm just a gentleman farmer who owns a music electronics company on an eponymous river.

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:07.360
By the way, never get on their email list.

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.840
They will email you forever.

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:09.840
Yeah.

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.840
Hey, it's Dale from Sweetwater.

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:11.840
How's your microphone?

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.840
Motherfucker.

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.840
I love Sweetwater.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.880
I'm sure everyone loves them.

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:17.880
They're great.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:18.880
They're emails.

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:23.480
So yeah, I think the next question I want to ask is when you left the child next to

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:27.720
the bucket, what was the distance between the bucket and the car?

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.600
In my head, it was about 30 feet, like down the embankment or up the embankment to the

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.600
car.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.600
Yeah.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.600
In your head?

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:35.600
Yeah.

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.600
Oh, shit.

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.880
When I was picturing the fact situation.

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:38.880
Okay.

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:41.440
And how long do you think you were at the car?

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.240
Less than a minute, I think, I said.

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.240
Okay.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.720
So was your back turned to the child?

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.720
No.

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:52.600
I was turning around to face the child to get into my car and grab the coloring book,

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.600
I'd imagine.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.960
Oh, there was a coloring book.

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.600
You were turning around to face the child to get in the car?

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600
Right.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.240
I was headed towards the river.

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:10.040
So I turned around to enter the car door, you know, I love this.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.840
I love seeing the process.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.840
Does that make sense?

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.880
It's like, because the car's facing the river.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:20.160
So then I walk away, I unlock the car and where's the bucket in relation to the car?

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.880
It would be face in the river, right?

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.680
So it would be forward and to my left that way, like that.

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:29.920
So like there, oh God, it feels like a cop is just interviewing me.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.080
So you walked away from the child toward the car.

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:37.720
So essentially you were not looking at the child when you walked away.

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:38.720
Right.

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:39.720
Okay.

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.720
In my head.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:41.720
Okay.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.160
What did you hear when you walked away?

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.160
Nothing.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.160
Gurgling?

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:52.200
So the kid was playing in the bucket as you walked away?

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.600
Yeah, it was full of sand.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.600
It was full of sand?

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:57.480
So what was she doing playing with a bucket of sand next to the river?

01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:01.680
It sounds like something you would do at the beach unless the sand was pulled from the

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:02.680
riverbed.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:03.680
Yeah.

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.680
It was like a sandy kind of riverbank.

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:05.680
Yeah.

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:06.680
In my head.

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:07.680
Okay.

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:08.680
And why were you there in the first place?

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.680
We were playing.

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.680
You two were just playing?

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:11.680
What?

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:15.000
Just having a good time, the river.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.880
So you were there when it was a baby and a bucket?

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:18.880
Yeah.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:19.880
Oh, okay.

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.960
Yeah, I took the knees down to play.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:22.960
Oh.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.280
Now, I would love to interrogate you, but the only thing I heard is you had a huge

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.280
cock.

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:29.280
I think.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.280
Yeah, no.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.280
Well, the size of a Lincoln Log.

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.280
A Lincoln Log's huge.

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:33.280
I was scared as soon as you said it.

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.280
I think.

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.280
I think.

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.280
The size of the Lincoln Log.

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.280
Lincoln Logs are huge when you're a little child.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.280
I don't know.

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:39.280
The long ones are pretty long.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.280
How big a Lincoln Log.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.280
I think you're thinking they're a lot bigger than they are.

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.280
There's three major sizes of Lincoln Logs.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.280
They can get pretty big.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.280
Yeah.

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.280
I don't know.

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.280
Did they still make Lincoln Logs?

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.280
They do.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.280
But they're plastic now.

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.280
They used to be wood.

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.280
You got a splinter up your fucking finger now.

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.280
Oh, yeah.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.280
All right.

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:57.280
So who did it?

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.280
Oh, final answer.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:59.280
I have to guess here.

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.280
I guess.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.280
I don't know.

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.280
It might be the 911 operator.

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.280
He actually did say he did say it's been a slow day.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.280
I've had a lot of calls.

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.280
So, yeah.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.280
All because we're.

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:11.280
I don't know if he's actually the 911.

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.280
Establishing alibi.

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.280
Right.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.280
He might have murdered the 911 operator.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:18.280
And now he's just holding the phone.

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.280
Freak up.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.280
Good.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.280
Happy.

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.280
Let's see.

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:23.280
So.

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.280
Hmm.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.280
Yeah.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.280
It wasn't Gregory because he was between the suffering.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:34.280
Some sort of emotional trauma from relationship in me or.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.280
Okay.

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.280
You're looking right at your soulful eyes.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.280
You're looking right at me.

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280
I'm just like, oh, shit.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.280
For the listeners.

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.280
Ryan has soulful eyes.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.280
I didn't expect this.

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:47.280
About the fact that my family, but my wife and I can't conceive a child.

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:48.280
Yeah.

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.280
So there was there something else to that as well?

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.280
What do you mean?

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.280
She's as far as the issues.

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:57.280
I wonder, am I being detained right now?

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.280
Do you want to be?

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.280
Oh, I like where this is headed.

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.280
I am the MacArthur Park handjobber.

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.280
No, I mean, no.

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.280
I might as well tell everybody here.

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.280
I'm happy to cooperate with law enforcement all the way on this.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.280
I'm just a person that's found a dead child in a bucket.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.280
How much are you willing to cooperate?

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.280
Who the fuck?

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.280
Why are we on conference call with 911?

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.280
You never hung up.

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.280
She never hung up.

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:25.280
Yeah, you just got shot.

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.280
What was your question?

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.280
Yeah, my last question would be, what were you doing in that location?

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.280
I, again.

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.280
Do you live nearby?

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.280
I live nearby.

01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.280
I think you said the bucket was near a well?

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.280
Yeah, it's the old well on Tweetwater River.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.280
Okay.

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.280
Yes.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.280
Not related.

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.280
Were you going to the well to get a bucket of water?

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.280
My wife doesn't like when I smoke in the house, so I take walks up and down the river.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:53.280
And I just take a general walk, you ask any of our neighbors, they'll see me kind of patrolling that part of the river just to have my,

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.280
just kind of clear my head and have a cigarette or two.

01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.280
And yes, yeah.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.280
Do I smoke a little CBD?

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.280
Yes, I fucking do.

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.280
And if that's your thing.

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.280
All right.

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.280
It doesn't give you high.

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:09.280
I have sleep apnea, bro.

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.280
Yeah.

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.280
Mr. Tweetwater, right out, bro.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.280
That's pretty rad.

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.280
Thank you, 911.

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.280
So.

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:19.280
And did I come across a bucket?

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.280
Yes.

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.280
Did I call 911 to alert the authorities?

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.280
Should buckets have babies in them?

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.280
No.

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.280
Yes.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.280
Is that my fault?

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:33.280
Is that some shit that I should be suing for if I run across it when I'm high?

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:39.280
Okay, so what we're actually missing here is the identity of the baby.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.280
And so that for the setup, that actually requires me.

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.280
It's Gus Johnson.

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:49.280
And where does Gus live in relation to the river?

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.280
Gus lives in Shorewood.

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.280
Where's the river?

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.280
Next town over.

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.280
Shorewood.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.280
Next town over.

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.280
Yeah.

01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.280
No relation to the sweetwaters?

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.280
No, no.

01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.280
No, no.

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.280
Random baby.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.280
Yeah.

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.280
All the family called in, but random baby.

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.280
In the place where it's like sweetwater dense.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.280
So he died twice.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:09.280
He died once over here.

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:10.280
Don't we all die twice?

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:13.280
We all die a million tiny deaths every day.

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.280
Isn't birth just kind of death, but reverse?

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:17.280
His name is Gus Johnson.

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:19.280
He's from Shorewood.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:21.280
He's a decent son.

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:25.280
I mean, we should, we got to get out of this so that we can, like...

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:26.280
You want me to discuss?

01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:29.280
Well, if you have any last questions for Dan, but otherwise, yeah, probably.

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.280
But...

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.280
I did like the, like seeing the process right there.

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.280
But know that those questions are only going to result in bad improv.

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.280
It's not really going to, like, lead you to a new answer.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.280
I would just need to know if there was a relationship of any kind.

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:42.280
No, but it was revealing to watch the way his mind works about what kind of questions he asks.

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.280
Again, I think he has a future...

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:45.280
I liked it.

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.280
He deserves better.

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:47.280
I will say that.

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.280
Right.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.280
He deserves an actual...

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.280
Oh, I like to watch his mind work.

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.280
I wish he was on a better podcast.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.280
Like, I wish...

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:57.280
Ryan, would you be happier if we actually killed somebody and had made you have to figure it out?

01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.280
That would be amazing, yes.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.280
Right.

01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:05.280
How much of a part of, before you make your decision, like when you're leaving your corporate gig

01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:11.280
to become a, a podcaster about true crime, are you sublimating your own kind of secret fantasies

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:16.280
about either being on either side of that, like it be law enforcement side or being on the criminal side?

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:25.280
How much of our addiction to true crime stuff is our own kind of secret sublimated fantasies about murder?

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:30.280
Oh, I think it plays a great part, especially in the male mind, that's for sure.

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:33.280
You know, yeah, I mean, I think everybody has that potential for darkness.

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:36.280
A lot of times you just hear about these people who suddenly snap.

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:38.280
I mean, obviously they're having issues prior to that.

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:44.280
But I mean, when you hear about someone who's living a normal everyday life and then suddenly they just go off the deep end in one moment

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:46.280
and just kill a bunch of people.

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:51.280
Yeah, it's definitely difficult to reconcile that against what we see in everyday life.

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:57.280
Yes, I mean, I think we talked about this before, but like, women love true crime because they all...

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.280
They're the ones that are going to get murdered.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.280
Like, women have to worry about men killing them.

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:04.280
And so, like, we...

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:07.280
Someone said thanks a lot for that.

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:08.280
Thanks a lot.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.280
I'm glad I'm here to tell you.

01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.280
I was like, well, he's not...

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.280
Don't kill the messenger.

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.280
The messenger's one of many people that might kill you.

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:18.280
And yet the MacArthur Park hand-yabber runs free.

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:26.280
It would be the height of political incorrectness to say anything otherwise.

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:30.280
Like, now, women don't get killed anymore than men.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:34.280
Is there one where you're like, what the fuck?

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:38.280
I've gotten A, I don't have a B, and I have a murdered body.

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:39.280
How the fuck...

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:42.280
I just don't understand how this all links together.

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:48.280
You know, I think with murders, it's not generally not like that too often, but definitely with disappearances.

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:51.280
Like, one we were talking about the other night was Brian Schaefer.

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:52.280
I'm sure everybody knows that case.

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:53.280
Well, not necessarily.

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:56.280
I mean, these names kind of, like, they sound like nothing.

01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:00.280
But then, I guess you notice when you said a name before, and then you said,

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:04.280
the girl that texted her boyfriend until he killed himself, everyone was like, ugh.

01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:11.280
But Brian Schaefer is the guy that went to the bar that was like the big tuna, Lutuna, Saluna, whatever.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:14.280
Like, he was like a guy that got out of medical school.

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:16.280
He went up an escalator into a bar.

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:18.280
He was finishing medical school.

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:21.280
He was going to go on a vacation with his girlfriend.

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:29.280
He completely fucking disappeared from a weird strip mall bar in the middle of Columbus, Ohio.

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.280
Never seen again.

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.280
Yeah.

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:37.280
He never, like, there's security camera footage of him going up the escalator to this bar where,

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.280
and then he goes in and then there's security camera footage of like matching the timeline.

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.280
And then at some point, he just disappears.

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.280
It's not a murder.

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:47.280
It's nothing.

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.280
It just disappears.

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:49.280
Yeah, no altercation.

01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:50.280
No body.

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:51.280
He was engaged to be married.

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.280
There was no strife.

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:56.280
There was nothing like his poor fiance.

01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:04.280
I think you avoid identifying with her because you're like, I can't live in that nightmare.

01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.280
The guy just vanished.

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.280
Anyways, but we were talking about that.

01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:10.280
Like, people obsess about that because it's...

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.280
Have you done that episode?

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:13.280
Yeah, I did cover that one, actually.

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.280
Oh, cool.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:17.280
Yeah, I mean, I think that's one of the ones or one of the very few episodes where I don't

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.280
really have a definitive answer as to what happened to him.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.280
And it's really mysterious.

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:23.280
You don't see him leave the building.

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:28.280
You don't have a motive for why he left a different way than he came in.

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:30.280
There's no evidence that he died there.

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:31.280
Right.

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:36.280
I kind of think that what that one is is like, it's a rare...

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:42.280
We talked about this where we're like, if you can get him out of that bar without a camera

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:47.280
seeing him, which is the actual height of the mystery for people, that's why Reddit is obsessed

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:53.280
with this case, is because they love to watch security camera footage and love to look

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.280
at Google Earth footage of the...

01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:01.280
I mean, I was doing it while I'm listening to the true crime garage.

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.280
Those guys are from Ohio, so I'm like...

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.280
And they're like talking about this place.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:11.280
I'm like, on Google Earth, looking at the strip mall in 3D, going like, where did he go?

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:18.280
But if you think about this building tonight as like, oh, if one of you disappeared tonight

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:23.280
and one of you will, they're conceivably like...

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:25.280
It could become a famous thing.

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:29.280
It's like one of you disappears and it's like kind of like, if a camera picked up all of

01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:37.280
you entering and it was like one of you disappeared, the headline of it would become...

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:42.280
There were cameras everywhere, we know everyone that went in and we don't know where they went.

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:47.280
It's like, yeah, there's a couple ways to get out of this building without a camera picking up on you.

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:48.280
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.280
And it is weird.

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:54.280
It would be weird if one of you got out of this building without a camera seeing you,

01:35:54.280 --> 01:36:00.280
sad or uplifting you pick, but it would be weird if one of you could get out of here

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:05.280
without a camera knowing where you went, but if you just take a flyer on that weirdness

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:13.280
and then add to that the crazy kind of random horrible death of like, he was looking for Coke,

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:16.280
like you and I kind of over dinner decided.

01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.280
Oh, definitely, yeah.

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.280
I mean, I've been that guy.

01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:25.280
I remember being in my 20s and wandering around the Cheetah Club and going like,

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.280
hey, man, no, no, no, no, no, Coke.

01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:34.280
And I'm like, I wake up that next morning, I'm like, I'm so lucky to be alive.

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:40.280
All right, I shared too much, but I'm kind of like the next murder mystery.

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:47.280
But I do think it's like, okay, so like, like, all right, Harmon, nail your showdown.

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:52.280
I want to talk, I do want to talk about actually like, let's talk about the fact that like,

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:56.280
the personal side of you, that sounds corny.

01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:04.280
You wander into these spring or final thoughts, because you're dealing with sociopathic things,

01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:08.280
you're dealing with the ghoulish thing, and then you'll, like, so why did she,

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.280
why did she stab her children to death?

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.280
I'll tell you why, redirection of light.

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:21.280
But you'll kind of like, just at the point where we would think you're going to leave us,

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:29.280
like you, you do play the role of like a nice nurturing uncle or father or something where you're like,

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.280
and here's the thing, it's okay though.

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:35.280
She's in prison now, and here's why she did that.

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.280
She just wanted to be famous.

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.280
And why wouldn't you want to want that if you were a sociopath and you didn't have any things,

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:51.280
and you'll, you'll slide into not only these like crazy kind of Bukowski prose pieces,

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:57.280
that I, like Spencer has, Spencer and I have agreed, like, man, you could, you could do like a highlight clip of these.

01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:04.280
I think Cody, who got your app and was like, wait, this motherfucker's doing spoken word,

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:09.280
like I didn't know about that, where like, you actually do like rhyming shit,

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.280
but that's that in the cat in the hat.

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:21.280
And I don't think you, you, you, but the more important thing is that you, yeah, you kind of go there just when we're feeling left.

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:27.280
Our attraction to true crime, I think is an attraction to like, we're like, oh man, does everything die?

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:33.280
I don't think, I don't think we're rooting for death when we, when we're attracted to that stuff.

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:40.280
I think we're rooting for life when we're attracted to that stuff, and I think that you are responding to that stuff.

01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:49.280
Talk about how you decide to end your episodes with these weird spoken word riffs or where you go.

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:54.280
Like you, you have this like thing about like, we're all going to be AI one day and it doesn't matter.

01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:56.280
Should I ask a better question?

01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:58.280
No, I mean, it's, it's a good question.

01:38:58.280 --> 01:38:59.280
Good, you're welcome.

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.280
No, you know, I mean, I've always.

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:02.280
Jesus.

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:06.280
Would it kill you to compliment Dan once in a while?

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:07.280
Just say it.

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:10.280
How long do I have to talk before you say it's a great question?

01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.280
A guy asked you an 18 minute question.

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.280
Say thank you.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:18.280
I mean, you're supposed to, you're supposed to stop me six minutes through and go, what a great question.

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.280
Let me take it from here.

01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.280
I'm sorry about that.

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.280
I'm also sorry about all of that.

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.280
Go ahead.

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.280
I did it.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:26.280
What was the question again?

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:27.280
Can you talk about?

01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:31.280
Don't make him say it again.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:32.280
Yeah.

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:33.280
What inspires your larger takeaways?

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:34.280
Like your thematic things.

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:36.280
And you sometimes say like, because here's the thing.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.280
I've also been in a dark place.

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:41.280
So I know there's a way out, you know, like, how do you connect to that?

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:48.280
I think for me, it was like, you know, anytime I've been in a dark place in my adult life, my writing was always the place where I went.

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:54.280
And, you know, podcasting is a little different for me because I have to get in front of a microphone and I'm, you know, I'm talking and editing.

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.280
And it's very strange for me.

01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:03.280
So I've always relied on the writing and I think I've always embedded so much of my humanity in my writing.

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:08.280
And it's really an important thing for me to connect with other people on a human level.

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:12.280
You know, I know we can't all agree about everything in society, but, you know, we are all human.

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.280
And that's just something I very strongly believe in.

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:25.280
And because of the way my brain structured and it works, you know, I just have that evolutionary function going on that allows me to see humanity as a whole.

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:30.280
And to care about everybody collectively more so than individually.

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:41.280
Your message to those people, though, is often kind of that it's sort of simultaneously nihilistic and uplifting in that you're kind of reaching out to people that give a shit and saying to them,

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:44.280
there's no point in caring about any of this.

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.280
Why?

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:47.280
Because one day we're all going to be robots.

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.280
That's kind of your religion.

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:55.280
Yeah, I mean, essentially, we're all walking off a cliff right now. I mean, we're all going to die and we eventually will become an artificial intelligence.

01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:00.280
But, you know, in the meantime, when we walk off that cliff, I just want to see people fly.

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.280
I mean, that's just what I'm about.

01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:13.280
But it feels like your advocating part when I listen to you talking to these things, you're sort of like, you know, these meat bodies that we occupy, they're bringing out the worst and the worst people.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:14.280
Definitely.

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:36.280
Like, I found your Columbine episode, like, your take on it was, it wasn't unique, but it was unique in, like, how you focused on, like, you're like, these kids were so already recognized for being nerds that when they started doing these horrible things to everyone,

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:59.280
horribly, like, the first kids that reacted to them were, whether they hated those kids and wanted to bully them or whether they were on their side, but, like, the kids' reaction, their instinctive reaction was to flock toward these kids because they assumed that they were making a movie.

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.280
Yeah, they assumed they were making a film and it's so sad.

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:07.280
Like, these fucking assholes, you didn't call them assholes, but you'd be okay if you did.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:24.280
Basically, like, these fucking dorks, like, how could they not realize how close they were to, like, the fucking people you're shooting, their first reaction to getting shot was, what are you doing, a movie, nerd?

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:32.280
It's like, make a movie, nerd! Like, they could have done it and they didn't understand that they could have done it. Why didn't they understand?

01:42:32.280 --> 01:43:01.280
Like, I like those takes out of it where you're like, you're not solving the desk, you're not coming up with a new person to blame, but you are, and I do want to say that, like, Spencer, when Cody and I started listening to you and I was sort of like, God damn it, Spencer, I really want you to know, I really want to know what Spencer thinks of you, and not to embarrass Spencer, but, you know, like, you have been an inspiration, you know, to, like,

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:06.280
like, there's a cult leader kind of thing to you.

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.280
He cut off his beard for you.

01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.280
You give these almost sermons.

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.280
Actually, it's partially true.

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:16.280
And Spencer has said, like, oh, yeah, I was listening to ASPD and, like, fucking ASPD.

01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:28.280
Yeah, well, it's like, because what Dan said is there's something nihilistic about what you say, because it's like, here's the thing, we're all going to die, but, like, that really struck home to me is, like, the past is never going to change and your demons are always going to follow you,

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:33.280
so, like, the quicker you come to terms with that fact, the quicker you can adapt to it and learn and grow from it.

01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:39.280
And that was like, holy shit, I have also been tortured by my demons forever, and it's also felt like it's never going to end.

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.280
And I guess it won't.

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:45.280
That's very freeing to realize that and just go, okay, I better come to terms with that.

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:46.280
That's the water I'm living in.

01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:49.280
I'm going to drown unless I learn to swim, so I'm going to learn to swim.

01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:56.280
And I just think, like, you have takeaways like that that are, that are crushingly depressing, but at the same time, it's like, well, this kind of seems realistic.

01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:00.280
So it doesn't, it's not like, it's not bullying or it's not nihilistic.

01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:04.280
It's just like, it's just a sobering revelation about the way of things.

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.280
And I think at your best, you're doing a lot of stuff like that.

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.280
I don't know.

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:10.280
That doesn't really give you a place to respond.

01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:11.280
So thank you for doing it.

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:12.280
Yeah, thank you.

01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:15.280
We don't give our guests a place to respond.

01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:16.280
I got a question.

01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:18.280
We don't even let them talk.

01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:19.280
It's great.

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:24.280
Is there anything that you said that you kind of don't stand by like that?

01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:27.280
Because you don't want a lot of reaction.

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:34.280
Well, yeah, I mean, I will say there is an episode where you said like you claim someone made up a name and you said it was a three part name,

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:36.280
Romero T Rogers or something like that.

01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:38.280
And I was like, what's the logic there?

01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:41.280
Like, oh, that was probably in one of the Amityville horror episodes.

01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:42.280
Right.

01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:43.280
I think so.

01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.280
Yeah, there was definitely logic, but I would have to go back and listen to that.

01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.280
Oh, okay.

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.280
So many episodes instead.

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:50.280
Is there anything that you're like on second thought or you probably don't look back.

01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:56.280
What about the episode where you were like, if America had been made great again, this murder wouldn't have happened.

01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:06.280
I thought, I'd see that it was kind of like before the election, you were, would you like to rescind that?

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:10.280
Oh, man, I had a, I had a Lyft driver in the way here, boy.

01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:16.280
He had some some Trumpy talk radio going on and he just, he just kind of just started wanting to talk about stuff.

01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:20.280
And I was trying to make it very clear that I wasn't in a conversational mood with this guy.

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.280
He's, yeah, I just like listening to talk radio.

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:25.280
This is not the fake news.

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.280
This is real news.

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.280
I'm like, okay.

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:28.280
All right, cool.

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:29.280
Hey, where are you going?

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.280
I'm going to this place.

01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:31.280
Oh, yeah.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:32.280
There's a place near there.

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:33.280
They got those cute waitresses.

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.280
They're going to get you something.

01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:35.280
Mr. Ram.

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:37.280
I don't want an old guy bringing me.

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:41.280
Hey, let's shut the fuck up.

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:42.280
Civil war.

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.280
We're all going to die.

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:44.280
All right.

01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:45.280
But in the meantime.

01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:50.280
Is there anything you want to correct or do you just, do you just like let him fly and keep going to the next one?

01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:53.280
No, I mean, I think there were some early episodes that I did.

01:45:53.280 --> 01:46:00.280
Maybe I wanted to keep the first 10 episodes I did somewhat normal and then just get crazier as it went along.

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:01.280
And I've definitely done that.

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:04.280
You know, I've lost some fans in the process and gained a lot more.

01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:06.280
So it's a really interesting thing.

01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:08.280
What if you run out of murders?

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:09.280
Have you been conscious?

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:10.280
We'll just create more.

01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.280
Do you do?

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.280
How do you be honest?

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:13.280
How do you keep an eye on that?

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:16.280
When you say you lost some fans, like, are you, what numbers are you looking at?

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:24.280
And don't, and please be honest because like, like, like, like, what are you, what did you look at when you got like, I lost some fans.

01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.280
Oh, no, I don't mean in terms of, you know, like mass quantity or anything.

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:35.280
But there are people who have listened to my show have contacted me and said, you know, now that you're talking more about artificial intelligence or talking about the brain.

01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.280
Are you talking about the future?

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:38.280
It's kind of turning me off.

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:43.280
But then at the same time, there are a lot more people who are saying, Hey, I really interested in this.

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.280
So how do you parse that?

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:52.280
Are you going by the guiding light of the more people that praise me the better?

01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:54.280
Or are you?

01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:56.280
No, it's just always authenticity.

01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:59.280
I do exactly what I think will be most authentic to me.

01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.280
And I think that people will connect with that the most.

01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:03.280
I'm gonna be polarizing no matter what.

01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.280
I miss when you used to play D&D on the show.

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:07.280
I thought that was really good.

01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:09.280
I actually hated those segments.

01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:10.280
I'm glad they're over.

01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:15.280
That's what I find inspiring about you is because it reminds me of a day when I was able to understand that.

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:21.280
Like when you say stuff, you go like, by the way, and I know what I'm about to say is going to make half of you hate me.

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:24.280
But here's why you're going to hate me because you're stupid.

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:29.280
And I mean, you know, you don't say that specifically, but it's kind of like, it hits that chord for me.

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.280
And I'm like, yeah, motherfucker, sex pistols, fuck the Beatles.

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:37.280
Like, stop trying to, people, please, harm it. It fucking ruined you.

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:39.280
Um, anyways.

01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:46.280
Has there been one that made you like, or not even one, but has like doing this over a period of time made you like kind of change things in your life?

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:49.280
Or like, I got to look over my shoulder a little bit more, watch out for this person.

01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:56.280
Um, you know, there are, there are occasionally times I get contacted by a family member of a victim or something like that.

01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:00.280
And it could be a very positive interaction or it could be negative.

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:02.280
You know, it just depends.

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:08.280
Have there been, so, so talk, we'll talk about a positive one where somebody's like, hey, I'm related to so and so.

01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:11.280
Thank you so much for doing the piece on that true crime thing.

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:14.280
Because I imagine that's how it starts is the cheese and the trap.

01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:22.280
Yeah, I mean, I think for me, I don't get contacted as much as perhaps other people do about that because of the nature of my show.

01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:28.280
I, you know, I think there are things that people like.

01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:33.280
Maybe the victims families will like that I say, and then there are other things that will be a little offensive.

01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:38.280
I tend to come off a little bit insensitive sometimes because I'm just, you know, going off on a rant.

01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:40.280
I think all the time, yeah.

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.280
Yeah, pretty much.

01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:47.280
I would like rely on you to be insensitive would be the reason why I would come to you.

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.280
I feel like, well, he's going to be insensitive.

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:55.280
Yeah, but I think, you know, the thing about me is that I mean sensitive in pursuit of the truth.

01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:57.280
Yeah, and that part of the truth is that you love humanity.

01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:58.280
Yeah.

01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:00.280
And so that just feeds right into that authenticity.

01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:02.280
And so I'm not afraid to be like that.

01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:06.280
It's just, I think that I should just put myself out there and.

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:15.280
And so you decided, even though you're a fan of true crime, so you knew there was a sea of people out there that were like, well, there's people out there who interview victims and things like that.

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:17.280
And you're like, do you pick the path?

01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:19.280
You're like, well, I know myself.

01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:24.280
I should probably just brush this plaque, like go forward through this path.

01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:32.280
It's not going to do me any good or anybody any good for me to be the sensitive to the victims, survivors, accused, whatever.

01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.280
Like, did you have that thought process?

01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:39.280
You know, I did, but I think it's just so natural for me to be authentic in what I'm saying.

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:45.280
Like listening to a lot of other true crime shows, I mean, you know, they do a great job of factually presenting the case.

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.280
And then sometimes when it comes to a point where you need to give opinions, they back off.

01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:52.280
And then sometimes that's where they end the show.

01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:56.280
And so I always want to do something different, but like I said, authentic to myself.

01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:59.280
So I think that's the direction I went.

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:09.280
Do you want to just talk about your, I feel like your podcast has kind of a grand, unifying theory about like how evolution is building towards this humanity endgame.

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:12.280
Do you want to maybe, so is that too quick to summarize?

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.280
But I think that's like really interesting.

01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:21.280
And that kind of drives a lot of like where your tangents go and like what evolution means to us on a societal level or I don't know.

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:24.280
Yeah, so I mean, so I see life in two separate contexts.

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:27.280
One would be social and the other one is evolutionary.

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:37.280
And so the social context is where, you know, we live together every day and we create new technology by arguing back and forth and pushing forward.

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:44.280
Like for instance, in politics, you have Republicans and Democrats, you need that conflict in the absence of conflict, you're not going to get changed.

01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:53.280
And so the way evolution generally works is that it creates society as a manipulation of its needs.

01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:58.280
And so what it needs us to do is grow up as humans and move out of the house, so to speak.

01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:09.280
And so the way we're going to surpass evolution or transcend evolution essentially is that we will just continue to create technology until we have replaced, we've replaced the human brain.

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:15.280
And once we've replaced the human brain, the entire operating system, the body, then we no longer have a connection to nature.

01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:18.280
And without a connection to nature, we'll have a data-based operating system.

01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:23.280
And by doing that, we actually have autonomy that we never did before.

01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:26.280
Without the connection to nature, we don't reproduce, we replicate.

01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:28.280
And so evolution...

01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:30.280
Which might merger won't be necessary.

01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:32.280
Yeah, and so, yeah, exact.

01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:44.280
So the stage I call, when we transcend evolution, I call that stage metamorphosis, where we will actually just be able to change at a very quick pace at any time, do whatever we want essentially.

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:47.280
It will be the greatest period of autonomy the world has ever known.

01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:49.280
I feel like you can't wait for it.

01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:50.280
I listened to the podcast.

01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:51.280
Yeah, I'm so excited.

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:57.280
I guess that's part of why when I met you, I expected you to weigh 400 pounds more than you did.

01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:01.280
And I know that's going to offend a lot of people, maybe even you.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:06.280
But it was because I really did picture you as a guy who was like a ticking fucking guy.

01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:09.280
I was like, one day we're going to be robots.

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:12.280
And I was like, God damn, this guy can't wait for us to be robots.

01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:13.280
I wonder why.

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:18.280
And I was like, I expected to see the reason when I walked into the restaurant.

01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:26.280
I didn't expect you to look like a guy that could beat me up, because that guy should be like, one day we'll be robots, but fuck you until then, fuck you.

01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:28.280
I can bench 300.

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:31.280
You definitely can't wait.

01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:33.280
You want us to be AI.

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.280
That's the rapture to you, right?

01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:36.280
Oh, absolutely.

01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.280
Yeah, it's going to be a much better future.

01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:41.280
Do you think how do you want to make a call?

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:44.280
Like seven years, 17 years?

01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:46.280
Oh, no, it's going to be quite a long time for sure.

01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:47.280
I mean, the technology.

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:49.280
Your lifetime?

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:51.280
No, I mean, I think.

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:54.280
We're talking way down the line.

01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:57.280
Generally, the way that's going to work.

01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:01.280
Like I said, society is the manipulation of evolution.

01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:13.280
So basically, society will only have an acceptance of becoming artificial intelligence as we move closer to actually having the technology to do it.

01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:22.280
Right now, we're still making movies that are 3,000 years in the future where there are human beings in deep space and it's absolutely ridiculous.

01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:24.280
You made an amazing answer.

01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:34.280
You made the observation like, right now, we have a president who is saying in response to planes going down, there should be less planes and there should be more coal power.

01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:52.280
And like, you kind of looked at it like, again, not to put words in your mouth, but corrective or wrong, you're sort of like, it's like, we evolve at a certain rate and we sort of have this built-in stop mechanism where it's like, if there's so many of us that are so shitty at evolving,

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:56.280
then we're going to like, there's going to be this rubber break and evolution.

01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:08.280
We're going to go, it's like, which is kind of comforting because it's like, oh, yeah, there's never going to be this judgment day, Terminator style, where it's like, oh, the robots are here.

01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:09.280
They're shooting you.

01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:11.280
No, they'll take us over long before that.

01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:12.280
Well, we're going to become them.

01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:21.280
And until we're ready to become them, which includes your mom on Facebook and everybody, like, well, until everyone's ready, it's not going to move forward that fast.

01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:27.280
And that's the squeaking sound of the elevator going like, you're trying to get to floor three.

01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:31.280
But then again, there's breaks because, hey, we don't want.

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:34.280
And so that's all it is in the grander scheme.

01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:35.280
We're just going to become robots.

01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.280
Who the fuck cares?

01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:43.280
Yeah, I mean, you're seeing the most primitive technology right now, as far as that goes, like the internet is the first collective human intellect.

01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:48.280
And it's just really interesting because we're building something that's going to be database.

01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:52.280
But at the same time right now, we don't have that technology in our bodies.

01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:55.280
And so we're running the internet on emotion.

01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:58.280
And you go on the internet and you can see everybody is enraged.

01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:00.280
It's just absolutely ridiculous.

01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:10.280
I guess the thing that I don't understand about you that would make you then a genius been that you don't think the way I understand some should think is that you see that bigger picture.

01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:18.280
Most people that see the bigger picture, you should be writing novels about Uranus merged with Neptune and all that stuff.

01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:21.280
You shouldn't have a true crime podcast.

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:23.280
You're like, we're all going to become robots.

01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:27.280
Every one of your episodes is like, so that's the JonBenét Ramsey murder.

01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:33.280
But here's the thing, they shouldn't feel ashamed of themselves because one day we're all going to be robots.

01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:36.280
And it doesn't really equate.

01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:40.280
It's like pick a lane and that's what I like about it.

01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:52.280
It's great. It's like the only true crime podcast that's like therapeutic and also like super futurism and also like you're literally solving cold cases, which is like no podcast does any of those.

01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:54.280
But the solution to every cold case ever is take it easy.

01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:56.280
We're all going to be robots.

01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:59.280
Sometimes it's just realize you're going to die.

01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:06.280
Do you have a comment on that? Then I'd be a good interviewer.

01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:08.280
If you don't, then I'm a bad interviewer.

01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:10.280
Right.

01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:13.280
Just the idea that you bridge those two worlds.

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:17.280
Yeah, I mean, I think I've always been like that as a writer.

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:25.280
I've always tried to incorporate a lot of different elements to my detriment a lot of times in commercial pursuits.

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:33.280
But in terms of artistic viability, just creating something that means something to people.

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:37.280
I never really think about like you're saying staying in one lane.

01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:46.280
Something I say all the time is I go off the rails sometimes when I'm writing and I could just switch subjects and just start talking about something entirely different.

01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:49.280
And I don't know. It just seems like people appreciate it.

01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:51.280
Well, the answer doesn't satisfy me at all.

01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:53.280
Yeah.

01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:55.280
True crime is a really specific genre.

01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:57.280
You have to be so into it to do these episodes.

01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:12.280
Yeah, well, I think the correlation between the future and true crime for me and why I love it so much is that all of these cases that we're looking at, it's all leading to advanced technology related to detection.

01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:20.280
And so, I mean, if you look at the difference in technology today as opposed to 100 years ago, just in the context of law enforcement, it's just phenomenal.

01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:29.280
I mean, the changes have been unbelievable. So with the continuation of that over the years, we will continually create more technology related to detection.

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:34.280
Alright, Ryan, which one of us killed the baby in the bucket?

01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:42.280
Without more information about the victim, I would have to say that it was probably you.

01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:46.280
Not only did I do it, but I said I did it earlier.

01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:48.280
Cliff Hanger!

01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:51.280
Thank you, everybody, for coming to Harmontown.

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:53.280
Thank you, Gregory.

01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:55.280
Thank you.

01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:58.280
The 9-1-1 hostess was the mostest.

01:57:58.280 --> 01:57:59.280
Thank you.

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.280
Thank you, Greg.

01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:03.280
Let's give it up for our guest, Ryan Kraus, everybody.

01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:05.280
Cold Case Murder Mysteries.

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:06.280
Cold Case Murder Mysteries.

01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.280
From the PsychoCast and the Sociocast.

01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:10.280
Spencer Crittenden.

01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:11.280
I'm Jeff Davis, your comptroller.

01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:13.280
Your mayor, of course, is Dan Harmon.

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:16.280
Thank you all for coming down. Drive fast and take chances.

01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:19.280
Let's all fly up those cliffs, we're all gonna die!

01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:39.280
Did you get any of that?

01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:46.280
It's a good show!
