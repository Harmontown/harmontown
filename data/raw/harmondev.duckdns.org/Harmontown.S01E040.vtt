00:00.000 --> 00:19.000
Salt Lake City, Utah! Bonsoir! How are you doing tonight, folks?

00:19.000 --> 00:31.000
The snow-covered streets of Trolley Square, wherever we are, and the beautifully refurbished

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Wise Guys comedy club, Harmontown, is now officially in session.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Would you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
You know him. You might love him. Dan Harmon!

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
Salt, salt, salt, salt, take some chloride, take some sodium, salt, salt.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
You guys love salt, right? Everyone loves salt?

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
I was like, okay, there's a guy holding a sign in the audience that says, Utah, 1922, never forget.

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
Which I think is like a deep cut reference to our podcast, right? We were making up tragedies at one point.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
Okay, we got another one over here. 65,000, Utah, you know what you did.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
I don't even remember the reference now.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
You're completely in shadow. Find your light, Harmon.

01:29.000 --> 01:41.000
The camera guys want me to move back a little bit so that I can make their job of capturing reality a little more artificial.

01:41.000 --> 01:52.000
Sorry, my humanity wasn't marketable enough for you, Michelle Gondry.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
So what was the deal?

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
You know, I would have done a show standing in a big shadow.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Now we'll never know what that would have been.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
I probably would have talked to this guy. He probably has cancer or something.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
Now I can't. Everything's fucked up now. But they got their shot, Jeff.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
They're painting with light.

02:15.000 --> 02:25.000
Fucking directors. Salt Lake City is about humanity. It's not about film.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
You know, I understand there's people here who fled Sundance to get here, right?

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
I heard about your vests, your matching vests and your beards and your Sundance vests.

02:37.000 --> 02:45.000
Colorado, fuck Colorado, right?

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
That's where Denver is. Is that where Sundance is?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Where's Sundance?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
It's in Colorado.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Okay.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
It's up that canyon?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
It's in Utah.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
All right, all right. Look, Utah's great. Sundance is okay.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Salt Lake City is the best city in the world. We know that.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
And salt is the best condiment. Seasoning, whatever you call it.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
I know there's like people here, Jeff, they don't like salt being referred to as a seasoning.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Did you know that?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
I did not know that.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
They're offended by that, the way that some deaf people don't like cochlear implants.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
You know, it's like the idea in Salt Lake City is that salt is a meal itself.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
And that you use potatoes and steak and stuff to make the salt go down better.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
It's a real thing here, you know, this is the salt capital of the world.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
Their roads get real icy and their potatoes get real, real, real, real, real bland.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
And they eat the salt.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
It's also the complex drinking law capital of the world.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Oh my God, Ron Cuey.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Complex, do it again?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
It's also the what then?

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Complex drinking law corner segments.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
All right, everybody, welcome to Utah, home of the weirdest drinking laws in the world.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
You don't know them?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
We've memorized them.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
We've been here for three hours and we've learned one-tenth of the fucking wild ass liquor law you have.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Complex drinking laws.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Let me explain them.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Jeff, you can't have a double here.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
A double, a double drink?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
You can't have a double drink.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Why not?

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
There is no why, that is the because.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
You can't, it doesn't matter why not.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
There was a, but I'll tell you, Brigham Young, he had huge hands.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
So, and he was very, very ashamed about them.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
He was a wood carver and a philanthropist and a brilliant man, but he had these giant hands.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
And so they made special big glasses for him to make him feel like his hands were smaller.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
That was the original BY and BYOB, do you know that?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Big Brigham Young's own bottle.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
Yeah, because the whole city had to kind of arrange itself around Brigham Young's deformed hands.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
And so people were like, secretly, people would wear like prosthetic giant hands.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Like that's where those foam number one hands come from.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
It's like, just to make him feel better, because he was a great man.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
He founded a great city and he loved salt.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
He ate so much salt, Jeff, that he retained water in his hands, I think is what...

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Have you ever heard the expression, Matt, as a hatter?

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
You know, that's from the lead lining in Haberdasheries.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Mercury lining.

05:51.000 --> 06:01.000
There's an expression here called, you know, hands the size of Brigham Young.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
So he had special giant glasses that they would get out for him.

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
If you ordered a double here in 1828 when Brigham Young was here, you could die.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Like everyone was drinking out of extra large glasses.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
So that's why no doubles.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
But it doesn't matter, today it's in honor of temperance.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And that's why the foam hands only hold up one finger.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
I'll have one.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Yes, I'll have a single.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
You want one drink?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I don't want two enormous Brigham Young size drinks.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Don't do doubles, said the bartender at the Marriott Hotel.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
There's something really weird about that, too.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
When you're at a Marriott Hotel, I'm pretty sure Marriott as a hotel chain probably has

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
more hotels than there are people in certain cities in the United States.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Like as a corporation, it's practically a country.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
And it's like, I don't know what's ironic about that, but something is.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
It's like, you just work at a Marriott.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Give me the Marriott goods.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
If Utah said I couldn't sleep in a bed, would there be no beds in the Marriott?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
What's in charge here?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Does the money walk or the bullshit talk?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
I walked into the bar at the Marriott and a nice young lady said,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Sir, I need to scan your ID.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
I'm like, OK, I've never seen that ever.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
And she took it and then she wrote down every bit of information off of my ID.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
And then she put it in a thing and it came out and shredded and then she said,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Go fuck yourself.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I thought that was a crazy lady thing.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Is that a Utah thing or is that a crazy lady thing?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
That's a Utah thing?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Maybe crazy ladies are a Utah thing.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Like lithium's a salt, right?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
It's all coming together.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
But also, we were just told that you're not allowed to, in this restaurant,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
you're not allowed to be walking around with your drink.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
You have to be seated and eating like chicken wings to have it.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah, we broke the law coming up here.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
We called 911 before we came up.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
We had to somehow get it.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
You'll notice there's an elaborate trolley system along the walls,

08:09.000 --> 08:15.000
like in Mr. Rogers' house, because the wait staff is not allowed to walk while holding liquor.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
So there's a little choo-choo train that comes by.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
And they have to technically, they have to pretend that they're here to catch a train.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
And then they go, oh, I'm holding a beer.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
And then they go, I think this is yours.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
They have to go through so much, and they have to wash their hands, too, on top of it all.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
The only way to get around it is to be in a wheelchair and have a plate of food in your lap,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
and then you can cruise around with a drink.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
It's complicated, complicated here.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Are there some other liquor laws that we don't know about?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
There's a lot. I work in a bar.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
What's your name, sir?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Let's do some.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
Let's name Duce up, because his awesome name and his expertise and his...

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Hello, Duce.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Duce is wearing a crisis alert t-shirt from Community.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
I am.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Awesome.

09:00.000 --> 09:08.000
So, Duce, you work in the liquor industry here in the city that invented complicated liquor laws.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
So let's run down some of the more weird...

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
Okay, so like this, this is considered a restaurant, so you have to have food to get a beverage.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
In a bar, you can get beverage by itself.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
You can't have a double, but you can have two different kinds of liquor in front of you.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
So you can order a tequila and a rum.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
That's fine, but not a rum.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Can I order two tequilas? No, I can't.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
No, but you can get tequila and a rum.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Because they saw five easy pieces, and they were like,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
okay, we're not gonna let a Jack Nicholson figure it out.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Like, I'd like to give me two tequilas then, and I'll...

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Ooh, look what I'm doing.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Like, they figured that out.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
You can hold the ice between your knees.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Okay, so if I have food in a restaurant, can I have a double?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
No, nope, still can't.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
I can never have a double, ever.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
You can never have a double, unless you're at home.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
But I was at Subway at a Utah gas station, and I got double meat on my...

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
That's a stupid comment, though.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
All right, well, give us another one.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Is there...

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
Let's see, you can only have two ounces of liquor in a drink.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
So, you know, even if it's like a Long Island, which has all kinds of different liquors,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
you can still only have two ounces worth of liquor.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Oh, total?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Total.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Oh, so you order a Long Island iced tea, and you can...

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
It's bullshit.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Like, yeah, does it come in a Dixie cup?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Usually, yeah.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
It comes in plastic here.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
All right, well, let me...

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
Maybe instead of just asking you to list the stuff off, let's just do an exercise.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
You be a bartender, I'll be a customer.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
Oh, what a rough day of being an American citizen that's supposedly allowed to do whatever the fuck I want to do.

10:43.000 --> 10:51.000
And having to put up with an ownership class of rich people that have 1% of whatever the 99% thing plan plan.

10:51.000 --> 10:58.000
I'm so stressed out, I would like to numb my brain with a legal substance that makes everyone around me smarter

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
for a couple hours, a couple blessed fucking hours.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
Can I please have a Kettle One on the rocks with no lime?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And...

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Okay, so the answer is yes, but then...

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Yes, sir.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Then you fill the glass with ice, and you fill it up like I've noticed...

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
It's a thimble fold.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
It's one ounce of...

11:17.000 --> 11:24.000
Okay, so I get it, and I go, okay, I'm going to slide this $5 bill across the table.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Oh, my.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Hey, can I...

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
Can I actually make it a double if we're going to be this way?

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
Then I'd look around, see if the DABC was in the house, and then I go...

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Is he a rapper?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Yeah.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
No, that's the beverage counselor or whatever.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Yeah, Department of Alcohol Beverage.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah, it's ridiculous, because I actually send spies in a lot to us.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Right, secret drinkers.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah, they really do, they really do.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
Lots of underage kids being like, come on, man, here's 20 bucks, let me in the bar.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Right, well, that's everywhere.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Does an Irish guy walk in and go, ah, we're shutting you down, deuce.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Oh, my God.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
We're shutting you down.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Jesus Christ, Jeff, you know who would hate it in Salt Lake City?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Jerry McSeinfeld.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Jerry McSeinfeld.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
Stay here, deuce, stay here.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
Oh, I'm Jerry McSeinfeld.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I'm an Irish Jerry Seinfeld.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
I'm famous for my observational material and my Irish heritage.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
So you can imagine, I'm quite puzzled by the state of affairs in your little bird.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Why can't I have a double?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
We've been over that.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I'm Jerry McSeinfeld.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Why is it so snowy outside?

12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
And why in such an inhospitable climate would you want to make it even harder to drink?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
What's happening?

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Why do you want people to move away so bad?

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Why you're always closing all the roads so we can't escape?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Aye, sir.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
That's the exact reason.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Oh, my God.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
It's me.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Irish Tim Allen.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
It's Irish Tim Allen.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Irish Tim Allen, what did you do today?

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
We went on tool time, sir.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
He talked to me neighbor Wilson.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
He's a little Scottish.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Irish Tim Allen is a pirate.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
Don't judge Salt Lake City.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
You live on a salt lake.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Why is it a salt lake?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Why would you want to put salt in a lake?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
The worst place for it.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Oh, sir.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I fixed that with me tool time supplies.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Oh, I'm Irish Seinfeld.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
And he's Irish Tim Allen.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
All right, thank you, Deuce.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Deuce, everybody.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
I thought that Irish Seinfeld would have a lot more material

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
here in Salt Lake City, but he actually doesn't.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
He actually, this is the city that puts me and Irish Seinfeld

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
on the same page.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And everybody, because he's like,

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
why can't you have a double?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
That's it.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Why can't you have a double?

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
Just put a billboard outside as you enter the,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
is that a statewide thing or a city thing?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
A statewide.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Okay, so as you cross the border to Utah,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
just put up a big billboard that says,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
not you can't have a double.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Say, why can't you have a double?

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
And then the answer underneath it will say,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
because we love you.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
And they have like a black lady with a baby.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Something to make it.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Is there anybody here that's from Utah

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
that still manages to get drunk occasionally?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Is there anybody here that's a drinker?

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Does it keep you from getting drunk?

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
I imagine, Jeff, that the alcoholism is rampant here.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Among the youth.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
I saw SLC punk.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
With Shaggy.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
When I was like, I don't know, 16, 15,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I think I was like 15 years old in high school.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
We came up to Utah from Southern California

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
on a ski trip.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
So we went to like Park City and Snowbird

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
and you got a pair of Alto or Alto, whatever.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Yeah, it's great.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Best to know in the world.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And we had no booze.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
We were all 16, 15 year olds.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
And I was kind of like a huckster.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I was like a shoplifter and a bad person

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
and a burglarizer and stuff.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
I was commissioned to go out and get the alcohol.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
So I went to a hotel and it was a really cool

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
like little liquor store in the lobby of a hotel.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
But it was just like liquor.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Like no beers, no nothing.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
It was just like a really old time like

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Chandler novel kind of thing.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Like an old hotel with a booze department in it.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
And they probably had like a house dick

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
walking around, you know, like busting people.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
And I went to the guy and I was skinny,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
a little 15 year old.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
He was like, hey, my dad's having a big party

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
with a bunch of his asshole friends up in the room

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
and they're too drunk to come down.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
He sent me down to buy this stuff.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Here's his list.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
And I just put this piece of paper in front of him.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
He was like, oh wow, that's clever thinking of him.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
So it's like, I just bought like just bags and bags

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
and bags and bags of booze.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
And his response was, well, that's a good idea of your father.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I never thought of sending the kid down.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
What a good idea.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
It's good, yeah.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
A human shield.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
I came back.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I was like Alexander the Great when I came back around.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
There was Trump.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
There was a lot of booze.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
The waiter, Marcus, came over to Deuce

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
and started whispering something to him.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
And I thought he was going to,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I thought the SWAT team was going to come in

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
and stop talking to them about the liquor laws.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
By the way, I filled up a glass of Grey Goose up here.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
I'd say, is this like a sword swallowing act to you guys?

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
Like, am I like Mel Gibson and Beyond Thunderdome

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
with the kids?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Like, oh, the pocket clips.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Oh, fly, fly, pilot man.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
He has a full glass of liquor in his hand.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
All right.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I'm not man, it's not you guys.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It's the fucking government.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
And by government, we mean the ghosts of like weird,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
like it's got to be like some guy in the 1800s

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
was like, well, they can't have doubles

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
because every time I have a double,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I know I want to rape people

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
because I'm a vile person that makes laws

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
and I make them because I ask myself,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
what would I like to do today

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
if I could do anything I wanted to do?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Well, I'd eat that little girl

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
and I'd own those black people

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
and I'd hit them when they did something wrong

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
and I'd clobber my wife over the head with a shovel

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
and like barrier in the backyard.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
We got to start like making laws against this stuff

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
because they're making the mistake of going,

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
oh, everyone's a vile old prick in the world

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
and it's just, that's the problem.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
That's why we have to figure out, Jeff,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
the Constitution for Harmontown

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
and it has to be like a little piece of code.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
It has to just be a very simple,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
got to figure it out before we get back to LA.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I think it's do what you want.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
It is do what you, it's everyone gets to do what they want.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
You got to say it like that.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
You got to say it, it's Jeremy Kramer's old bit,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
do what you want.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
It's like the mafia.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Everyone gets to do whatever they want

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
unless it interferes with someone else's ability

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
to do whatever they want.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Dot, dot, dot, question mark.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I don't know what to put in there.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
If two people both want to do something

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
and they can't both do it without one of them

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
having to do something they don't want

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
or not getting to do whatever they want,

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
then you engage in a ritual called patty cake.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Well, I think back in the old days,

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
manors were, there was a high premium on courtesy

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
and people opened doors for each other

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
and people helped old ladies across the street

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
and put cloaks over puddles and stuff like that.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I don't know if they really did.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
That might just be in a book.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
But maybe they just had more cloaks back then.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
They didn't care as much.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Now, I guess we have evolved technologically

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
and we evolve as a species.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Courtesy seems just to be something that's dying.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
It's devolving.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
The whole thing comes down to,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
yeah, I want to do this, but I want to smoke a cigarette,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
but these people might not want it,

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
and someone walks over and politely goes,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
hey, man, can you not smoke a cigarette?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
You know, I'm sorry.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I'll take it outside.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Have a human conversation about it.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Be adults. Have some common courtesy.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Yeah, but then there's this rise

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
of the passive-aggressive mutant,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
like somebody who's cool

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
but is always getting what they want,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
leveraging people socially.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
You have to protect against...

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Then you tell that person you're being a dick. Shut up.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Well, then that person can also say

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
you're being a dick for not giving a...

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
There needs to be a little bit of a foolproof.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
I understand the whole idea is be cool.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
But it's got to have...

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Here's my theory.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
There's got to be a way to back the dollar

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
with human life instead of, like,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
a mythical piece of gold in Fort Knox

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
or a stock or the dollar itself

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
or pride in your country.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
If you were able to back a nation's currency,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
because currency is going to be useful

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
still for a little while.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
We can't all become hippies and run around

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
and kiss gazelle or something.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
We've got a hundred years left of still needing poker chips

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
to get through our day, to make transactions.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
I say, though, you can back that currency with...

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
It's like a video game.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
When you're playing a video game,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
there are video games where you're walking down the street

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
and then there's a thing that goes,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
someone needs help and then you go and help them

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
and then you get some bonus points.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
And there are actual points that you can use

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
to get a bigger gun and blow the fuck out of something.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
It's shit that you can use to make yourself cooler.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
At the very least, when you show up...

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I've discussed this before.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
If I'm walking down the street

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
and there's a guy laying on the sidewalk

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
in a puddle of his own piss

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
and I'm like, I had a bad day today, can you help me out?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
My reason for not stopping

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
and having a conversation with him

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
and seeing how I can help him is I'm late for lunch.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
I got shit to do. I got a script to finish.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I got all this stuff to do.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
And the reason I got to finish my script

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
or be on time to lunch with my friend,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
all that stuff just has to do with capitalism, really.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
It just has to do with, like,

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
okay, I'll end up like him if I help him.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
I'll end up like him if I help him.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
So all you have to do is reverse that

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
and say, if I help him,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
the opposite.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
So that when we see a guy laying

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
in the middle of the sidewalk in a puddle of his own piss,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
we go, holy shit, I can't believe I found one.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Like, this is like a hidden package

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
in Grand Theft Auto.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I just stumble. Do you know how rare these are?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
People who need my help?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I'm rich!

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
And because if I help him,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
then it's like, I get points.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I get a power-up of some kind.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And then because

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
the whole country works that way,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
we're the most powerful country in the world

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
because all the other countries go, like,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
oh, that country where everybody's,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
fuck, nobody's laying on the sidewalk

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
in their own piss.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
They all just, every time someone

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
starts to have a bad day,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
eight people jump on him and help him

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
so that they can profit off of it karmically.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
And so everyone lives in a fucking, like,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
penthouse over there. Everyone's, like,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
floating around.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
You're talking about destroying capital.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Now, like, so if you replace

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
helping people with capital, like,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
the whole point is that we've got to a place

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
where capital is the whole point.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Accumulation of wealth is the definition of success.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Competition is a good thing.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
You know, getting ahead of other people.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Yeah, but, but, like,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
a couple thousand years ago,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
the definition of poor was, you know,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
you lived until 25

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
if someone didn't come into your house,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
stab you in the face and fuck the stab-hole.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Like, that's not

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
what it means to be poor anymore.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Now being poor means you eat a Big Mac

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
out of a dumpster and you have a coat

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
that someone gave you.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Like, you're still walking around without a house

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
and you get fucking cold and you die sooner.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
But, like, the

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
definition of

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
the 99% keeps going up.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
We can increase that

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
by a thousand fold.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
That's my theory. I'm no economics professor.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
But I don't think that capitalism

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
necessarily, yes, it means

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
that there's, like, a pyramid in place

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
and that there's a competition in place.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
But why can't the poorest person

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
in the world

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
have, like, a giant TV

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
and get to play video games and...

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Oh, it could, but it profits none.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
You know, enough food goes to waste every day

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
to feed almost everybody and, you know,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
there's certainly enough housing and clothing for everybody,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
but prices have to be at a certain place.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
We have to make sure that rich, white, gross people

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
control shit.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
They don't have to be.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
That's been the easy way to do it,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
you know, and it's all

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
kind of falling apart anyway.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Like, rich people, like, there's a

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
shorter path to, like, you know,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
keeping poor people poor.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
That's what makes sense to a rich person.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
But, like, if you challenge them,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
they tend to

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
figure you shit out.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
The thing that bumps me out is, like, a room like this.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
There's no government in here.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
This is the proper definition of anarchism.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I mean, there's nobody ruling anybody here.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
And it's like, I'm Jesus Christ.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I'm gonna shit on my hand and throw it at you.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
No cop can help me.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Like, like,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
that guy, that guy becomes in charge.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
He's Bane now.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Oh, I'm, I'm,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I'm headlining at wise guys.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Like, I'm the new Kevin Neelan.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
There's a lot of

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Kevin Neelan pictures.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Kevin, Kevin Neelan is there.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Is Kevin Neelan a part owner here?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Did Kevin Neelan, like,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
create a dying pregnant woman here?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
See, I think in the middle of his act,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
a woman was like, I'm six months pregnant

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
and chunking on a hot wing.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
And he's like, excuse me.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
And, like, just brought her back to life

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
and gave her $1,000.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Kevin, Kevin, before you go,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
how can we repay you?

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Your thanks is enough.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
No, how can we repay you?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Put up 400 photos in the end.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Create a system of laws in my name

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
that make it hard to drink.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I am the Neelan.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
He's like the Stargate guy.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
He'll come back every once in a while

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
and suppress literacy.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
But he gets worshipped here.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Anyways, like, if that guy,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
if a guy stood up and, like,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
fucking tried to choke me to death,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
you would be the people

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
that helped me.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
You would save me, possibly.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And vice versa.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Like, we have weight staff here.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Maybe we have a bouncer here.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
We have, you know, we...

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
These are all private, anarchic roles.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Like, we put...

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
You need a bouncer and you need a white person

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
and you need a club owner

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
and you need a performer and you need an audience.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
We're not animals.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
We know how to fucking behave ourselves.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
We don't need a fucking senator

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
to tell us, like, what left from right is.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Those are the only people

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
that don't ever do anything.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
It just fucking confounds me.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
We've created a new society

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
where we...

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
You know how, like, bees,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
they raise their own royalty.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
They're just sitting there as larvae.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
You could fucking eat them.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Like, and then these queens hatch

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
and then they sting the other queens to death

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
and then they take over and these poor soldiers

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
are just like, oh, thank God we have a queen again.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Like, I understand

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
the desire for comfort and leadership,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
but in America,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
the idea that was that we...

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
those people are civil servants.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
You're not wearing a crown.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
You're wearing a clip on tie.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Get to work, motherfucker.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
So I can go do the shit I enjoy.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I want to be a radio DJ.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I want to be a dentist.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I want to dig a ditch and then, like, punch a clock

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
and not worry about shit from 8 p.m.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
to 6 a.m.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Some people might prefer doing that shit.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
None of us want to balance the budget

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
and make the garbage trucks run on time.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
That's why we elect officials.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
The president is supposed to be

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
a fucking dipshit civil servant.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
He's not supposed to be someone

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
that we cower in the presence of

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
and most importantly,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
that people literally murder

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
and cheat and lie and steal

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
to try to become, because they have the most power

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
in the world.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And all these fucking lawmakers,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
all right, anyway, sorry, let's do a fart corner!

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Fart corner!

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Farts corner!

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Hold on, I got to cue up the music.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Fart corner offsets the political rants.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Fart corner is the place where a dignity dance.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Fart corner's gonna make it real!

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Fart!

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Alright, it's that time again.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Fart corner!

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Fart corner!

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Get ready to get farted on by your favorite

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
farder, Dan Harmon!

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
What's your name?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Dude.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
What's your name?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Colton. No, it's not.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Woo!

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Fart corner!

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Sorry about the armchair politics.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
But when we go to the moon, I swear to God,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
like, when we go to the moon,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
the first person I catch talking about

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
me like I'm in charge gets shot.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Okay, I overreacted, I overreacted.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Set the guy not in charge.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Alright, we have to...

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
It's complicated, it's complicated.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
We have to work it out, but

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I knew that Salt Lake City was the place

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
to talk about this because

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
they're living in a...

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
They come face to face

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
with the absurd hypocrisy every day.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
They live in a lake made of salt.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Are you guys proud of living here?

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Is this a place where people take pride

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
in living in?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Woo!

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Well, who would say no?

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
It was a measured...

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Deuce is shaking his head, no.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Yeah, but there's an elitist effect, too.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
You could ask that in Brooklyn.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Okay, I just...

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Towns that aren't New York or LA,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
we have this kind of elitist training, too,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
to go like, oh, I live in Denver,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
but... Sorry, I burped.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I live in Denver, but I don't like it.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Can I leave with you?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
You know, there's places...

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And it's self-hatred.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I've been here a bunch of times,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
and I don't know anything really about this town.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Last night, I don't think we really got

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
to meet the true Denver.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
It's nice to...

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
We leave right after the show.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
We have a couple drinks, we get on the bus,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
and we go to Portland.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Well, you know, Utah, I mean,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
there's no better way to get to know

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
a community that you're in, Jeff,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
than familiarizing yourself with

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
its active sports community.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
It's that time again.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Sports Corner!

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Hey, everybody, it's a lot like

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Park Corner. It's a lot like

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Park Corner, but less people get farther, though.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
He's going to fart in your favorite

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
sports team, Dan Harmon.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Sports Corner, Utah!

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
All right, Dan, you've been

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
pretty vocal in the past about

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
the jazz. What's

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
your problem with this team? Why do you come down so hard on it?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Jeff, defense. This is a game about

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
defense.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
The jazz needs to understand

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
that if you're not protecting the ball,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
you're actively attacking it for the other team.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Yeah.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
And that is a simple thing.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Our moms told us that when we would play

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
the jazzest game.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I mean, he's a little older,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
he's still putting the numbers up.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Do you think it was wise to re-sign Carl Malone?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I think Carl...

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I think Carl Malone is

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
a legend, but he's a functional

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
legend. There's legends and then there's fossils.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
So you look at Kubrick, you look at

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
...

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
You look at Hitchens on the Nuggets,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
you look at, I don't know, Tiger Woods

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
out there in the seventh inning of the last

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Clippers game.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Malone

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Malone is different from

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Woods, different from Kubrick, different from Hitchens

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
in that he's

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
a functional legend. He still has value.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Most importantly, leadership.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
The other jazz...

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
The other jazzes are going to look

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
at Malone

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
and they're going to remember what it's like

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
to be proud of the jazz.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Listen,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
it's a game about spirit and mind.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
I don't know what people think moves that ball

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
from left to right out there,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
but it's

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
not just yardage, it's handicaps,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
it's icing the knee,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
it's taking things quarter by quarter

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
and it's leadership, it's belief

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
that your team can do it and Malone brings

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
that to the jazz.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Frankly, that's what the jazz has been missing.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
I'm not going to win any popularity contest

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
saying this, but

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Malone belongs on that team

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
and Hitler was right.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000

Brought to you by Nabisco

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Sports Corner

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Secret racist agenda in Sports Corner.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Don't know if you caught it. Sports Corner

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Stuck in a pro

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Nazi message at the end.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
It's just that simple.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Sometimes you catch it, sometimes you don't.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Some of your racist agendas

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
are more subtle than other times.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
That's when you just said Hitler was right.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
He got caught.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Jimmy the Greek got caught.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I'm very cool about it.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I'll slip it in.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I give a boom, goes to the dynamite.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Hitler was right.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
What do you think Hitler did right?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Top 10?

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Yardage.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
He really put up some yardage

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
against Poland in 1939.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
He was first in completions.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Always be attacking.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
This is going to end up out of context

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
on Huffington Post

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
or TMZ.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
And the word Chevy Chase

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
is going to get mentioned seven times.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Oh well.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
That's life in the tag cloud.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
It's a tag cloud society now, Jeff.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Got to keep that ball moving.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
You know, I feel like

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
there's been one good thing.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
There's been many good things about this Harmon tour

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
that we've been doing.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
But speaking of the internet

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
and the benefits that it has,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I think if we do one thing in this tour

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
is that we've released into the ether

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Spencer Crittenden.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Spencer.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Spencer to the stage.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Spencer, are you with us?

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Spencer Crittenden, everybody!

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Oh.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Approaching the table.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Wearing his vintage community shirt.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
He sets down his bag

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
with an earth-shattering thud.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
The mics are hot

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
but the crowd is hotter.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
His beard contains secrets

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
and scrambled eggs.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
He's a better rapper.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Yeah, yeah.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Spencer, I did a rap debut last night

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
in Denver. Yeah, it hasn't podcast yet

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
so we're letting you know.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Spencer has emerged as the master rapper

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
of the tour bus.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
I don't feel like the battle has really reached

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
an end. No, no, no.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I think that was the first...

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
That was the opening cling-clang of a sword fight.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
We haven't really got up that staircase

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
and swiped the candles in half yet.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Can we talk about Gobler's Knob a little bit?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I was laying in my bunk

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
in the tour bus and we were about

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
45 minutes out from Salt Lake City

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
and I'm looking on the map where we are

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
and I noticed a little town

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I don't even know if any roads connected

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
to the highway we were on.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
It's just a knob. I don't even know if it's a town.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
On a map known as Gobler's Knob

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
which...

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
That's what I would call a town if you let me

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
name towns.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Has anybody been to Gobler's Knob?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Really? It's not that...

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Has anybody heard of Gobler's Knob?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Yeah, pull it up on the map.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
We should all go after the show.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
We should all go to Gobler's Knob.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
They changed the name though. It used to be

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
really embarrassing. It was like

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
just penis dick

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
cock swallow valley.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Boner Huffer.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Gobler's Knob.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I love that it's not knob goblers.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
It's Gobler's Knob.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Hi, I'm Carl Gobler.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
There's a knob where

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
you can have a nice glass of lemonade

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
with me, Carl Gobler.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Why isn't there a band called Gobler's Knob?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
It's so good.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Gobler's Knob.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Everything at Gobler's Knob

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
is very, very serious.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
You know that they have to be very serious there.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
If there's people that live there,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
you know there are experts in keeping it cool.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
There's like eight libraries

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
every block.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
We live in Gobler's Knob,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
so somebody fucking compensates here.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
You see, Dan said earlier

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
they probably have a really good holocaust museum there.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Yeah.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Anything serious.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
There are experts in the serious.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
It's all to offset.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
There's a sign as you go into Gobler's Knob.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
It says, welcome to Gobler's Knob.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
This is a serious place.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
This is for real.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
You didn't come here to make fun of us, did you?

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
You want a t-shirt, we get it.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
If they had any brains,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
there's a big sign that says welcome to Gobler's Knob

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
and there's a gift shop right there.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Get your t-shirt.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
There's a turkey sucking a dick.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
There was a guy

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
in Milwaukee.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I just want a t-shirt with a turkey sucking a dick.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I'm from Milwaukee, Wisconsin

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
and there was a war hero

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
from there

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
that fought in World War II, I think,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
and he had parks named after him

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
and some streets named after him

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
and his last name was Bong.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
And there was a Bong Wreck area.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And the sign

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
was cold riveted.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
There was, I would say,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Bong Wreck area is this little sign

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
that was just like any

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
ordinary sign for anything else,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
but it was like fucking eight bolts

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
per centimeter.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
It was like razor wire

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
going up to it.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Giant chisel marks in the side of it.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
And they actually, I saw an interview

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
with his granddaughter

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
or something

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
who's still a Milwaukee kind of

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
socialite or philanthropist

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
or something, you know, the Bong name

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
lives on in Milwaukee.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
The journalist had to just be doing it

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
as a bit. It was like this interview

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
with this woman that was like

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
she just didn't understand

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
why is it the most

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
stolen sign in all of Wisconsin?

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Why do people

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
keep stealing the Bong Wreck area sign?

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
He was a war hero. He tried to do good

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
with his life, but I don't know if they're

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
being disrespectful

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
or if they just appreciate history.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
It's because

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
it looks perfect in your basement.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
There will never be enough

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Bong Wreck areas to put that sign up.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Spencer, I saw on the

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Instagrams that you and Aaron

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
made snow angels and you did it in your shorts.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Oh yeah, totally.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Did you bring pants? I brought

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
one pair of jeans.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Are they magic jeans? Do they have one use?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Are you saving them for something?

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Oh yeah, they recharge every couple of days,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
so I've been cycling them.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Is it for you, like when people

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
tell me to tie my shoe, like

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
people telling you to not wear shorts?

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
It's just obnoxious because people think

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
that because they're little wusses about

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
weather.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
That I am and I'm just fine.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I was fine in Bloomington. I was fine in

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Chicago. I'm fine here.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
You're not doing it to prove a point.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
You're doing it because you're more comfortable that way.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Well, at some point when people start

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
telling you to put on pants, you do it

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
to prove a point, but honestly,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
I'm fine. If I thought I'd be more comfortable

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
wearing pants, I would've just put them on.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
But the worst thing is,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
when I was a kid, people would tell me

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
to take a shower, you gotta comb your hair,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
take a shower, you stink, you're a piece of shit.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
And then the

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
one day I took a shower

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
and combed my hair and got on the bus

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
and all the eighth graders were like,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
wow, look at that dude.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Give me skin, man. Give me five.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Fucking seriously, man. Good job.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Good job. And I was like, never again,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
motherfucker.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
You just redefined

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
lack of hygiene.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I am going to be a millionaire

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
and I'm going to smell like a butt.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
You've done it. You've

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
accomplished your dream.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Yeah, I took a shower in the hotel today.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
You can't even tell. I'm so dirty

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
it doesn't matter anymore.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
I'm 800 showers behind.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I have to take like 80

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
showers in a row.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Our turbos smells pretty good.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
It's certainly about a halfway point.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
It would be smelling like a locker room on there,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
but it's pretty good.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
People tell me, like girlfriends and stuff,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
you talk about your lack of hygiene,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
but you actually don't stink that bad.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Your body is covered with

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
this symbiotic

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
community of microbes.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
When you wash,

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I'm not saying people shouldn't wash.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I'm just saying like,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
part of your immune system,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
your body's immune system that fights off

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
weird germs and stuff from the outside world,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
part of why we've all been touching

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
bathroom doorknobs forever without

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
having there be a giant epidemic,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
is because your body is, there's no real

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
estate on your body for germs because

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
it's covered in germs, your own germs.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
It's wall to wall.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
The entire surface of your skin

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
is shoulder to shoulder

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
with, you know, boogins and stuff.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
So it's like some kind of revisionist

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
hygiene history.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
No, it's just, look it up.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Google it, you fuckers.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
You cleanists.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
If you take too many showers,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
you'll like break out more often and stuff

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
because it wipes out that bacteria

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
that would otherwise be kind of protecting it.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
And I think, Aaron says like,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
because I'll not take a shower for

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
many days.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
And Aaron said,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
you don't really start to,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
you don't just start to stink.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
You just start gradually to smell more

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
and more like bread.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I've

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
smelled you when you stink. It ain't bread.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Well,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
then I don't

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
love you.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
No, we're never going to fuck.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Yeah, but maybe that's like a body

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
chemistry thing. I think so.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I think people's noses and other people's

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
BO are like, there's a thing,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
like it's like a speed dating thing.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I mean, there's a thing for anything.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I could make this up, but I'm not.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Somebody told me about this.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I don't know where they're doing this,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
but it's kind of, it's like a speed dating

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
kind of weird thing where people get together.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
You don't shower for

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
a day or

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
two days. I don't know what it is.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
You take the clothes

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
and then you freeze them.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
You bring them to

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
this gathering.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
And then the people do this speed dating

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
thing where these thawed

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
BO shirts.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
No cologne, no deodorant, but it's just

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
your BO.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Men and women, just like these anonymous piles

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
of clothes, and people go around

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
in circles and they smell

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
the bread.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
And you write down

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
what you're okay with.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Like, oh, shirt number eight.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I don't mind that.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
It smells like my dad or something.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
And

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
I can tell that person hasn't

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
had a shower for two days, but at the same time

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I wasn't repelled by it.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
And

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I'll tell you in the next

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
podcast whether or not it's working.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
80 people have been married

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
and that's all I heard.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Interesting concept.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
You could do personality tests.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
They gave people shirts and had them wear them around

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
for like a week and then they gave them to a lab

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
and then they gave them to people who weren't

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
trained to like understand and they'd

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
like made them smell it and said,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
what do you think about this person who

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
wore this shirt? And they were like actually

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
pretty accurate compared to if you just

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
looked at the person and tried to form a judgment.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Interesting.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Granted, our noses as primates have been

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
totally shut down.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
That's why we're blown away by dogs and cats

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
because we used to have snouts like

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
that.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Our eyes moved forward to the

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
front of our head to get stereoscopic color

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
and all this equipment

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
all this computer equipment up behind

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
your nose like that had to get

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
liquidated and like sold

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
and shut down.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Our noses compared to dogs are like

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
dogs noses are pretty much

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
their eyes. Dogs smell

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
as much as we see

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
and they just use their eyes

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
to not bump into a wall

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
and kind of zero in on the butthole

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
to smell.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
But then that butthole is like

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
a Facebook page.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I'm not the first person

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
to bring this up at Wise Guys

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
in Salt Lake City.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
I'm sure Kevin Nieland's got 20 minutes on this.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
But there's a wealth

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
of information they get out of that

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
but all we get is it smells

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
like poop. But

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
that being said I think there is more to smell

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
than we are used to

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
experiencing. Anyways

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
we got

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
deep tonight Salt Lake. I mean you can't

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
say that Dan Harmon didn't

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
come to your town and confuse you.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
And

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
that's what this show is all about.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Should we

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
go out in the crowd and find us?

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
We have to make a connection man. We're not going to be here long.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
You want to make a personal connection

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
with someone in Salt Lake?

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I like to go

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
with people who are feeling pain.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Not necessarily physical.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Someone who thinks they had a pretty bad day.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
It really doesn't have to be in a funny way

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
but anybody that's willing to

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
talk about

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
if it's a breakup

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
that you're not able to get over

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
or a job transition

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
or a long spate of unemployment

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
what's that?

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Are you volunteering yourself?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I got some job troubles?

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Okay let's bring them up. What's your name?

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Craig.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
This is Craig.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I'm from Wisconsin.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Oh Craig from Wisconsin.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
I don't know why people didn't instinctively

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
applaud you when you came up

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
under the stage.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Maybe you smell weird.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I don't know.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Craig so

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
you're specifically

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
having a hard time transitioning

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
occupationally?

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I taught art for 20 years Dan.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
And last year

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I had to resign just because

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Wisconsin has got some real bad habits.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Wisconsin has horrible things going on

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
educationally yes.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
My brother's wife is a teacher there.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
But now I'm trying to figure out

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
what to do next man.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Have you considered the Dan Harmon lookalike

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
contest that's happening?

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I think it's tomorrow night

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
in Ogden, Utah

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
that's the grand prize.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Let's get a picture together here

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
at the very least.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Can you tell

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
us Craig like

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
holy shit.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Guys over here.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Wow.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Who are your glasses for a second?

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Sure.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
So Craig tell me about your job.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Hey look I was a teacher

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
for 20 years Dan

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
and Wisconsin's fucked up.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Now I'm looking

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
for more work.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Tell us Craig.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I was going to say while Craig was Dan

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I was going to make him rap.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Craig can you

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Yeah.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
We'll build up to it.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
I want to hear about this Wisconsin thing

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
because I keep hearing about it.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
It's my home state shit is fucked up there.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Specifically it's more fucked up.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Education

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
it's a hot button

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
it's a liberal thing but it's also so

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
fucking true.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
It's one of the cheapest things

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
that we could be spending money on.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I love the kids too man.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
I love the kids but there's so many rules

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
that are not working.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
It's so easy to suck money out of that

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
out of that sector and it makes

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
no sense.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
It only makes sense to creepy rich people

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
because they don't get rich the next day

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
by putting any money into the idea

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
like yeah but it happens so fast

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
20 years from now you're going to feel that

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
you're going to have to do this

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
it's like the first thing you're going to

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
do is you tell us what's going on in Wisconsin

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
that has to do with unions and stuff

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Yeah they kind of busted up the unions

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
for the teachers and

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
now the administrators of all the

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
school districts can make up their own

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
set of rules.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
So I'm not supposed to speak about this

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
but I had 40 kids in my classroom

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
to try to teach art to at once

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
and it's like 40 kids is a lot of kids.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
That was part of the course when I was

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
I went to Marshall High

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
before I went to Brown Deer

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
and I was like was it 6,000

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
4,000 kids

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
and then I went to the suburbs and it was

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
600 kids and it was like

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
15 or 20 kids in a class but

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
when I was in Milwaukee public schools

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
there would be 30, 40 kids in a class

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
especially in an art class where it's like

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
oh you have to take art we don't want to spend

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
any money on it.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
You just six kids to a paint brush

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
because who's going to enforce this?

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
So again we had 30, 40 kids in my class

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
and I barely remember

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
that teacher's name because you got no

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
personal interaction with like we're all

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
making clay you know statues and stuff like that

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
there was no input, there was no connection at all

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
and so you end up doing a thing

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
and you get a grade on it but you don't know what you did

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
you don't know why you did it, there's no

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
interaction at all, there's no

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
nurturing or mentoring at all.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
That must be especially hard on an art teacher

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
where it's all about expression.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Well you want them to be unique right?

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
And what not so...

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Yeah there are human beings like you have no idea

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
like we obviously we

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
in a grand scheme of things what happened is

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
we know that education is important

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
we know that our kids have to go to school

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
and then all of a sudden this becomes like this

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
we have to have

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
this system so it's like and then

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
how do you allocate funding

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
to this system?

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Because it's not socialism

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
it's the government funds

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
this thing so how much should we fund it?

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
What are your test scores in this school?

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Okay so if our test scores

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
are this then we get this amount of money

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
for microscopes and if they don't

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
and the whole thing gets fucked up by guess what

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
money.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
It's no place in medicine or education

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I'm sorry to just be a typical liberal

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
but how

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
much more clear could it be

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
that education

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
and medicine like the dollar

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
getting near that stuff

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
it's only a couple minutes before

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
the fucking weird paradoxes start

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
to happen.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
So what do we have to do in Wisconsin? I'll make it happen tonight Craig.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Awesome.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Are you out of a job now? Are you tired?

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
I'm currently unemployed.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Do you want to get back into teaching again?

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Part of me will always be a teacher

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
but I want to come with Dan

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
and write movies.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
You guys could like go to meetings

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Dan could sleep.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
You could go in.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
It's like an Olsen twins movie.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Let's trick them.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
You'd be sleeping in the car

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
and Dan would come out and you'd tag out

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
and you'd put a shirt on and you'd smell like him

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
and you'd go out in the meeting. Zemeckis

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
wants a movie about a giant. Go.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Wait a second. Dan.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
We broke for lunch.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
What were you wearing glasses

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
earlier before you went to the lunch?

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Yes. The better to see you

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
with Mr. Spielberg.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Okay.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I don't know. You were being a real asshole

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
a couple of hours ago but now I really like you.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
You seem a little older and wiser now.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
You seem more artistic.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Yeah. You smell different.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
All right.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Well, aside from taking you

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
to L.A. I mean come to L.A.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Write a screenplay.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Have you ever written screenplays before?

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Is that something you dabble in?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Yes, I do.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
What kind

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
of genre stuff do you do?

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
I've done some

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
channel 101 pieces.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Really? Channel 101

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
he's talking about.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
I did a puppet

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
art teacher from Wisconsin

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
called Wackjack years ago.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
You remember that one?

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
That might ring a bell.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
It didn't make it into the screening?

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
It was the seventh one voted off.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
So I didn't make it quite in.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
All right. Well, I'm sorry.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
It would have changed my life.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
No. Way to go, Harmon.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
It would have changed your life.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
All you got to do is

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
wrap.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
I'll start.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
I'll start.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
You teach art.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
You're unemployed.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
I just farted. Sorry.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
I didn't mean to do it.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I fucked your mama like her name was

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Fruit.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I'll start over.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Breakdown. Salt Lake City.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Only thing that rhymes with that is your mama's city.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Hey!

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Lake made of salt drove to get here

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
when ice instead of asphalt.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
The bus almost tipped over three times.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Now I'm going to express it through rhyme.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
It's a hard place to get to, but I love the people here.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I fucked your mama so hard

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
that she'd spray beer.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Craig coming to the mic.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Craig's coming to the mic.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
There's Tom.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
He went to school.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Mr. Harmon is feeling so cool.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Hey there, buddy.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Don't do nothing fun.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
If you do, you're going to kill the sun.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Wow.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
That's mythical.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
He's Egyptian.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
When you eat the sun,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
every time you make a painting,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
holy shit.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Sorry.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Painting?

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
The sun just got eaten.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
The sun just got...

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Sky black as clock.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Can't see anything.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I fucked your mama so hard

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
her pussy started to sing.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Said la la la.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
And I said shh.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
A story's building.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
So far, just to keep

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
another day.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
A woman's kitty sprayed beer.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
And then someone got bad grades

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
in school so the sun got

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
eaten.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
And now a woman's pussy is singing.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Yeah.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Maybe we can connect those dots.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Take it, Craig.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
The sun is gone.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Hey mom, she's quite the fox

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
because she's the one with the singing box.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
So don't go there.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
She's not here.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Everybody go get all beer.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Salt Lake Craig.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Salt Lake Craig wrapped it up for us.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Salt Lake Craig, everybody.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
All right.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
For God's sake, support education.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Every time you...

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Every time you get all excited,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
thank you Craig.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Every four years, you know how we have this big ritual

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
where we pretend that the one guy

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
we vote for is going to make a huge fucking difference

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
for four years. There's also a bunch of other stuff

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
on the ballot. Every time you see the word education

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
say yes.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Because there's no way you will ever

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
go broke giving money to teachers

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
in schools. It's impossible.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Here's some stuff

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
that costs a lot of money.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Giant fucking weapons.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Like that will never be useful

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
against a guy who is born

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
in a crater and just wants

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
to blow shit up with his own body.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Like...

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Like the tanks will keep.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
They will keep.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Let's melt a couple of them down

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
and turn them into erasers. I think that's how that works.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
We made a human connection.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Your city, your state.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
The lower,

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
the more local your politics

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
get, the more important they are.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
The pothole outside your house

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
needs filling. It gets filled

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
or not filled based on a person

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
or a community going like let's fill the pothole,

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
take those resources, allocate them.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
A Walmart getting built on your corner.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
That's like local shit.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
The stop sign that stops a car accident

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
that stops people from dying.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
We argue about the dumbest,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
shit. I'm 40 years old.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Some of you are 25.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
You think gay marriage and abortion

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
they've made it up.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
They're pretending these are issues

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
because they're all in fucking cahoots

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
with each other. Fuck these guys.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Just like local politics

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
are kind of important.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
All politics are bullshit, but local politics

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
are a little more...

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
You get a little fucking yardage

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
if you decide to...

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
It's all about yardage, man.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Don't...

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Yeah, it's getting

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
tangled and crazy in Wisconsin because

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
we get...

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
We start thinking that we need some

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Superman in the White House in order to change

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
the world and all that guy is.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I'm sure he's a great guy,

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
but what the fuck is he going to do?

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Except to walk around and not embarrass me

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
when he talks. That's why I voted for him.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I literally just voted for Obama

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
because he was like, oh, he can speak.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I'm so embarrassed.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Was everybody crazy for...

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
The Mormon community here?

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Was everybody really wild for Mitt during the election?

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Yeah.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I'm curious about the Mormon thing.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
A good half of the population here

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
is still actually maybe not here,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
but...

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
How many Mormons do we have by applause

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
in the audience, in a Harmontown audience?

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Quite a few.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
20% maybe?

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Yeah.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Your next Mormon?

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
By Mormons and is now

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
basically, according to Wikipedia,

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
half non-Mormon.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
I mean, it's a capital city

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
in a city of industry now.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
It's not about Mormonism anymore, necessarily.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
There's not like a Mormon train

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
that's propelled by Mormonism.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
The train

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
has electricity in it.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
The banks have money in them,

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
not snakes.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
I don't know what Mormons believe,

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
but...

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I think they talk to snakes. I can't remember.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Should we get a Mormon person up here?

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Can we have a Mormon up?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Not a Jack Mormon.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Let's get a gal up.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Let's get a woman on stage.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Let's have a female Mormon

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
that won't be...

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
We want a Mormon's...

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
a proud Mormon.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Not a self-loathing Mormon.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
What's your name, miss?

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Okay, say again.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Talitha.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Talitha.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Like Eurythra.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Like Eurytha?

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
No.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
I met a guy...

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
There was a guy that had me sign his book

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
after the show.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
He said, can you make...

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Everybody's got a weird name, like Ridley and

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Blaker.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
The more original, the better.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
There's a thousand ways to spell Aaron.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
I always ask.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
I was so used to asking,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
can you get the right spelling?

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Can you make it out to Jathan?

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
J-A-T-H-A-N.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
J-A-S-O-N.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
I have a horrible speech impediment.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
It's really bad.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
It's so bad that I found a cartoon.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Thanks for pointing that out.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Oh my God.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
He's a Harmonian.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
We have a list when you have an S in your name.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
That's a bummer.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Alright, sorry.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Her name might be Talitha.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
That's a joke I was making.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
But no, it's Eurythra, right?

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Right.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
You're our first Mormon that I know of.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I don't know if anyone was a closet Mormon

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
that we've had on the show.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
We're in the Mormon capital of the country.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
I don't know what to ask.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
What do we do with the Mormon, Jeff?

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
I don't know.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
It occurs to me that I really know nothing

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
about Mormonism except the

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Mormon families that were in my high school.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
I know that they were very tightly knit,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
very large families generally,

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
and very close.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
They had their little home evening

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
or what do you call that?

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Family home evening?

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Do you still do that with your family?

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Are you coming from a large family as well?

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
I do.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Well, I have a pretty big family

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
and I don't know

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
by whose standards,

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
but I've got...

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I actually have five kids

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
and I'm 31.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Wow, hey.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
That's a big deal because, Jeff,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
what I've heard about Mormons is that you all get your own planet

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
in the afterlife.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
That's one of the eight things that I've heard about Mormonism

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
is that part of the scheme of the afterlife

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
involves your own world.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I've had three kids

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
and then we adopt two kids, too.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
That's pretty common.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Are these things like caricatures?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Remember when 9-11 happened?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
All the ticker tape on CNN could talk about

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
is the 70 virgins because everyone wanted to know

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
who would do this, why would they do it?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
That was the talking point.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Let's find the weirdest, silliest sounding thing

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
about Islam that we can

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
and just repeat it over and over again.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Well, they think in heaven that your dick is a pine tree.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
You know, like,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
hey, they already blew up a building.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
We already hate them.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Why did they do it?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I'm just wondering, like,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
because Christianity

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
has all kinds of weird shit about it

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
that if you've focused in on

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and Judaism and everything,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
like,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
for a modern Mormon,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
what do we talk about? Magic Underwear I've heard?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I've heard about the planet

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
that everyone gets when they die

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
and...

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And no coffee.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
No coffee? Is that Amish?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Oh, no stimulants?

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
No diet coke, right?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Yeah, there's a...

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Yeah, like a health code, kind of.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I don't drink alcohol.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
And

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
you stay away from

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
addictive substances, just in general.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Right.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
You get to have cool haircuts, though.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
There's no rule against that. She looks very cool.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I'm telling the podcast audience

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
that sounded patronizing.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
She's actually really...

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
If you had a podcast audience you were

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
casually reporting to, you would sound sarcastic sometimes,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
like the person at the bank would go,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
you can't have your money, I go,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I can't have my money, folks, it's just the way it works here.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Magic Underwear,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
what does that mean? I've heard that

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
phrase, Magic Underwear.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I'm sure that's speaking

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
in terms of

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
a clothing garment

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
that LDS people wear.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Right.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
LDS is Latter-day Saints, so that's the church,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
the name of the church.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
No, nothing magic.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
It's symbolic.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Right.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
What is it? Is it about chastity?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Partly, yeah.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
It's symbolic of...

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Get really specific, because I swear to God,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I've heard that phrase,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
people who are hating on Mormons, they go,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
they have magic underwear.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
They believe in magic underwear.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
They believe in Malaamari.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
knowing that that's all I've heard,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
that's all I've heard, like, what does that mean?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And I also haven't seen

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
the Trey Parker Mattsnown musical.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I don't know anything.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I don't know how to

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
get into it without having like a whole

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
discussion about, you know,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
all the fundamentals, but...

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Let's do it.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
We got all night.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I don't know if this is the right form.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
We have a Neelan's here on Tuesday, but...

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I can get the missionaries here in about five seconds.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
We already burned through a fart corner. We got nothing left.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I was hoping to get farted on.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Well, is there fear of getting it wrong, of sounding like you're misrepresenting your religion?

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
No, no, no, no.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Or is there fear of people that aren't affiliated, like, judging you?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Or is it just a fear of making the podcast six hours long because it's that complicated?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
No, no. I mean, the gospel is simple.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
It's a Christian gospel.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Right.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
So it's the Church of Jesus Christ of Lottery of Saints.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
There were more books later, like, in the New World.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Oh, yeah, yeah. You're familiar.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Books written at the same time that, yeah.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
But the underwear, like, you can't...

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
You don't want to cartoonify your religion, but...

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
If you go back to, like, in the Old Testament, the book of Exodus and things like that,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:09.000
they talk about when they go to the temple and putting on the holy garment.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
So it's the same type of thing. It's symbolic of certain covenants you make at the temple.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
So this is not a sexual thing at all. This is not about...

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
No!

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Oh, see, like, you know, Orthodox Jews, like, there's some sects of Judaism

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
where they have sex through a hole in a blanket or whatever?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Because everyone has their own, you know, old religions.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
They have old, old ideas about sex that are...

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I thought when I heard magic underwear, I automatically assumed it was some kind of, like...

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
That you wore during...

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Yeah, there was, like, didn't have a flap in it or something.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
So that when you were 16, you got a flap, or...

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And then you get to go to prom.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And Talitha, I'm assuming you're not wearing it now.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
You wear it when you go into the temple, right?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
No, at all times.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
So it's like a yarmulke, or, I mean, they don't...

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
So you wear it all the time?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Are you wearing it now?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I am, yeah.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
And it's about, like, a yarmulke is about, like, humbling yourself before God.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Like, you're covering your head. It's a symbolic, like, God-fearing thing.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
So this underwear is covering your...

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
So symbolic of...

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Well, starting, like, your body is, like, your temple.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Your body is your gift from God. It houses your spirit.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
So your body is kind of like your most sacred physical possession, I guess.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Where do you go?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And the fundamental level, no matter what you're doing out in society, underneath it all,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
is your relationship with the cosmos.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I mean, this is like, when I was a kid, we had a thing called Underoos.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
That where the...

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
They're sacred to you.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Well, I mean, in a secular sense, yes, sacred.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I'm getting picked on. I'm getting a swirly.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
But I'm the Hulk down here.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
They just don't know it. I'm Aquaman.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
You know, I have a relationship with...

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
With, you know...

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
That doesn't sound... Magic underwear.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
See, people are too...

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Yeah, we trivialize stuff.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
But also, people are very freaked out by other people's spirituality and stuff like that.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
So we do the opposite of trivializing it, right?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
We make it into too big a deal, because every single little thing,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
like religious traditions and rituals,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
are little, tiny, little things that sometimes have practicality

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
and sometimes don't, but in all cases are designed

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
to remind the individual in a world where God's not hanging out all the time

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000
that God is a part of their life, that they have a relationship with the unknown.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
And scientists get to punch a clock at work every day.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Their job is to study the unknown and figure shit out

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
so they don't need magic underwear to remind them.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
But if you work at Verizon, there's a lot of people

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
that are going to try to make you think that you should worship Verizon

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
and they should go fuck themselves if you're a Mormon,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
because when you go home at night, you're beholden to this other thing.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Do you go to a store to get them? Do you make them yourself?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
How do you...

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
It's an authorized store, yeah.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
So the church makes them.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yeah, it's like an authorized pattern.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
It's like kosher food.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
There's some factory somewhere where there's a rabbi going like,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
this hot dog's good to go.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
It's an authorized pattern.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Don't answer this if you don't want to. I'm not being creepy.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
What do they look like? What part of your body?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
What physically?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Huh?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Granny underwear?

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Just like from here to here.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Really?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Like an old tiny swimsuit?

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
No, just like a shirt and shorts.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
I still make one piece.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I hope everyone else got their buddy's words, but I certainly do.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I'm glad I finally learned about the magic underwear thing.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Let's say you go to the beach. Let's say you're taking a swim in the Salt Lake.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
What do you... Do you swim in the Salt Lake?

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
You're taking a float in the Salt Lake.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Yeah, then you would just not wear them for activities that wouldn't...

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Gotcha.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
That you couldn't normally do without.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Like, so, you know, if I'm going swimming or going to work out or...

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
All right.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000
You got five children. You can have any more. Is that the limit?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I'm not coming on to you, by the way.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
You have sexy hair. We want to know about your underwear.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Let's make it around six.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I'm drawing conclusions.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
How fertile are you?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Okay, well, yeah, I keep thinking, like, oh, there's a big wrap-up question,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
because I don't want to just have brought you up and talked about underwear,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
but communication is always a fucking thing.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Like, I'm obsessed with race, you know, all the time.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I grew up in the 70s. It's like, when I was a kid on the playground,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I was like one white kid and I'd be surrounded by a bunch of black kids.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And, like, I remember back then it was the 70s,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
and, like, we were coming off our Norman Lear sitcoms,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
and everyone was talking about the fact that people were different,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
and you'd have conversations, and you'd go up to a black kid and you'd go,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
can I touch your hair?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
What does it feel like?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
And, overall, you wouldn't know, because people were communicating,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
because, like, that's the human gift, is to communicate.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000
And then, like, somebody's saying, oh, they have magic underwear over Calamari,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and then that's all I hear, and then, like,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
all of the problem is in everything that's not explained.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Like, it actually doesn't sound very weird at all,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
and it doesn't sound very magical, either.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Or, yeah.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Sounds like ritualistic, ceremonial.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Yeah, it's ceremonial, symbolic.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Does it have a big M on it?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Yeah, that's Mario, that's Mario, I'm sorry.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Well, let's have a hand for our Mormon representative.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Thank you, Talitha.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Thank you.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Thank you.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I was hoping I could get farted on.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
You want to get farted on?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I was hoping.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
All right.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
You want the music?

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Yes, please.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Hang on, hang on, that's good.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Pretend I didn't do that.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
That didn't count.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Talitha wants the music.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Fart corner!

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Religious edition.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
All faiths from corner to corner.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Everyone's going to get farted on.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
That's a gear and a torner.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Made up a new word that I can do that.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Human beings can make up words and religions.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
That's our talent.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
That's what we do.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
It's called mythology, so scoop-de-doo!

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Yeah!

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Fart it on a Mormon!

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Fart it on a Mormon!

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Talitha, everybody, thank you so much for that.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
You know what Joseph Campbell said about religion, Jeff?

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Don't fart on it?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000
To paraphrase Joseph Campbell, people fuck it up because they think the Bibles are newspapers.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Your religion is supposed to have a transparency to it.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
You're supposed to be in on the joke.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
You're supposed to have one foot in, one foot out.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.000
The whole point of religion, the whole point of God is that the jar that God comes in says on the label,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
you're not supposed to understand it.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
It's not fucking steak sauce.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000
You don't get to incorporate it into your day-to-day without any degree of problems or difficulties with the people around you.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
It's a very personal thing.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Some religions make it a communal thing.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Notice how their communities, their kids have higher test scores and bigger pools,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
and we get jealous of them and then we throw bricks at their windows.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.000
It's like, fucking, it's God, dude.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
It's like, it's confusing shit.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
It both exists and doesn't exist.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
That's a big confuser right there, isn't it?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
That's a tough one to handle.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
He's not going to come down and go like, hey, welcome to Wise Guys.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Is everybody doing okay?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
That would be the worst God ever.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
As soon as he does that, he's fired.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
He becomes Kevin Neland.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
As soon as he makes an appearance, that's all he is, is Kevin Neland.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
He retains God status by staying out of the picture.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:53.000
There are less images of Jesus in a church than there are of Kevin Neland in this comedy clip.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Jesus is good with just that one, like, hey, did a thing.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
And our parents fuck us up.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
It's a popular 25.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
When you're 25, you go like, well, I don't, but you smoke a joint and you go like,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
ah, man, you know, God, just fucking bullshit.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I don't believe in some guy in a cloud with a beard.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
You know, I'm spiritual, but I'm not religious.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
It's fine, it's fine.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Just because your parents are dipshits doesn't mean that Santa Claus and God are the same thing.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I thought it was just your parents trying to pull a whammy on you.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Spencer, do you believe in all the way to jaded cynicism just to get back at your parents?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:35.000
What a waste of a giant brain that's designed to create and live mythology.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Spencer, do you have any spiritual side to you?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Do you believe in God?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
What's your take on the whole rigmarole?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I was raised a Christian, and when I was young, I accepted the Lord.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Sorry, it's a tone of voice thing.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
It wasn't a leap of faith for me.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It was like, okay, there's this dude.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Wait, if you're going to describe that moment, can we do it D&D style?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I guess.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Spencer, I'm being attacked by Christian parents.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Okay, with Bibles.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I was talking about a thing.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I can't switch gears that fast.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
He was going to talk about God, but he was going to explain what was going on.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Walking into the room clutching Bibles.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Your parents say they want to pray with you before they go out to eat.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Swallowing your pride, you acquiesce.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.000
No, but I mean, it just, it made sense to me as a kid, and then I grew up,

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
and it made less sense to me, and I was never someone who had faith like in anything.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I don't have faith that my mom was going to go back, you know, come home if she left.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I didn't have faith that the bus was going to arrive.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I have faith in nothing.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
So when it stopped making sense, I was like, okay, this doesn't make sense.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I stopped taking it to be fact.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000
So I think that there's definitely some sort of ethereal metaphysical power,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
and it manifests itself in many ways that we don't understand.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I don't know what those are because we don't understand them.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Ghosts, the Loch Ness Monster, and spontaneous combustions.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Those could all be the same thing, like those could be miracles,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
or those could all be psychic powers.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
The Loch Ness Monster makes spontaneous combustion happen.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Yeah, whenever you like the dreams about the sun.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
No, absolutely. I mean, when I was growing up, my parents were Christian,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
and told me when I would break a flower pot, they'd go,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
swear in the Bible that you didn't break it and all this stuff.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Nothing will make you an atheist quicker than Christian parents.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
And that's a proud American tradition.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Because your parents' Christianity is like, man, it can really blow.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
It's like their car. You get a station wagon from them,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
and you don't want either.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Your dream is to get a Camaro.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
When I was a kid, I was raised in a Lutheran school as a little kid,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
and you had the Sunday school and you heard the Bible stories.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
That was the only thing I kind of liked.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I never knew what they meant, but I liked the mythology of it.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I liked the storytelling about people blowing trumpets and knocking walls down.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I had no idea what the point of it all was.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
But I knew that Lutheran church, you get to sit there and doodle and nobody cares.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
So I just drew a lot, and I would leave the church,

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
and I'd go up to the pastor and he would put his hand out and he would say,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
let's see what you drew.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
He didn't care that I wasn't listening.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
He actually liked my little drawings.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
I told the story before I got on the podcast where I went to Sunday school,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
and my mom asked, what did you do today at Sunday school?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
It was like our first day at Sunday school,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
and I told her and she pulled me out because it was like,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
we learned to recognize Bible characters with flashcards.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
We learned to recognize them visually.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I can tell you the difference between Ham and Noah,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
because Ham had a cane in his hand.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Noah had a backpack.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
But confusingly, they were both cartoons.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
They both looked like Captain Caveman.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Confusingly, Kane had a ham in his hand.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And I explained this to my mom.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I said, I can tell you who Ham's wife looks like.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I can tell you Noah's wife looks like.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
That is ridiculous.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
My mom said, that is ridiculous.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
And you don't have to go to Sunday school anymore.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Holy smoke.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
But she also put the whammy on me with the, you know,

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
God exists and don't.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000
If I would be programming my Commodore 64 and it wouldn't work right,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I would go, God damn it, fucking computer.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And my mom would go, you know, she'd slap me and go,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
don't use the Lord's name in vain.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I think she was carrying some shit over from her parents.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
She just knew that if she had a kid that didn't respect God,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
she would fuck up as a parent.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
So she was just out of paranoia and anxiety.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It was like just putting the fear into me and nothing else.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
There was nothing.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And I remember I had these books that would be like,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
like the hand-me-downs of like, oh, see Dick and Jane hang out.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Oh, they lost their dog.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Oh, where's the dog?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Where's Spot?

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
We can't find Spot.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And I'm like, I'm learning to read.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
This is great.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Well, we can't find Spot.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
What should we do?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Turn the page.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Let's pray.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
What?

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Jesus can help you find your dog.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
He used to be hanging out in his robe in the middle of this book

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
about these 50s kids looking for their dog.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I remember that being a drag.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Because it wasn't a good story.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
It was Deus Ex Machina.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
And also weird, like Jesus is not like a cool-looking character

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
in a children's book.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Pardon me, Dan.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
It's very interesting.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Carlos, could I get another ale, please?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Did you call him Carlos?

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
That's his name, isn't it?

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
It's Marcus, isn't it?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
No, it says Marcus as he's wearing someone else's name tag.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
What the fuck?

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Wait, so your name is Carlos and you steal clothes?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Do you have any idea?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
We should point out he's definitely white.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Because I don't want podcast listeners to hear,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
just hear, oh yeah, there's a guy named Carlos

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
that's wearing Marcus's clothes.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
What happened to Marcus?

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I found my name tag.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Oh, you found it again.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Oh, ooh, Mystery Solves.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Thank you, Kevin Neland.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I don't know, Plot thickens.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
As far as I'm concerned, not Mystery Solves.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
All right, let's play Dungeons and Dragons.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
All right, let's do it.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Erin McGathy, will you please join us on stage?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And Carlos, once again, thank you for my beer, sir.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Is this legal?

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Can I do this?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
All right, perfect.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Carlos broke the law by bringing you the beer

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
because he's not eating while he's doing it.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Carlos has to have a pretzel in his hand

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000
in order to bring you the beer.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
All right, so Aaron,

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I never know how the show's going

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
because I'm up here.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Did I bore people with my political and religious?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
No, I thought it's a great show so far.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
There's a lot of content.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Four Star Review from my girlfriend.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
I liked a whole lot.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I love the religious talk.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
My dad was a preacher, my mom was a theology professor,

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
so I love that stuff.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Is that why I turn you on?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I mean, if you want to be gross, I think so a little bit.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
I was thinking about this a few nights ago.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
You're kind of a preacher.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
You're a fisher of men, a little bit.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I have a congregation.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Yeah, similar to my dad.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Yeah.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Does he smell like your dad?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
No, the dicks taste the same, but...

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Bread!

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Bread.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
They taste like focaccia.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
No, no, no.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Shout out to my dad.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
It is delicious clerical cock.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Wow.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
So awful, so awful.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Sorry to lethah.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
No, it's nice. You spent some time with my dad.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I have a really nice, wonderful, smart, very cool dad.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Sexy, strong, lies.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I went fishing with him. He's a cool dude.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I like him.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
You said he had a bunch of Mormon jokes that he used to tell,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
and then you texted him when he chickened out,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
and he said, I never had any Mormon jokes.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
He said Aaron, I was just explaining Mormon theology to you.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
That's why I'm here.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
I mean, if you find that funny,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I am the beholder.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
It's on you.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
But I thought you told me a story once about when your dad was a Navy chaplain.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
He had a Scientology book in his office,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
and somebody asked him what's going on,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
and he said, I'm reading this because one of the seamen,

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
one of my flock, is a Scientologist,

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
and he's reading all the Scientology books

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
so that he can get a better chaplain to whoever's on board his ship.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
That is fucking cool.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
That's cooler than I would be.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I'd be like, come on.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I'd read the back of the book, and I'd be like, okay.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I really loved having T'lith up there and talking about stuff.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
We certainly didn't get to the bottom of the heavy...

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
That's a whole podcast we could do.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Absolutely, but I was at a box brother's,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
like a place where you mail stuff,

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
and I was at Santa behind a dude in Los Feliz in our neighborhood,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
and he's a very well-dressed, middle-aged guy, nice suit on,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
very clearly well-to-do-ish,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
like life's been good to him, he's mailin' awesome stuff,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
and he had a Scientology ring with a little S in the triangle or whatever,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
and there were some big delays, so we're just kind of hanging out,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
and he's kind of tapping his fingers, and I notice the ring,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
and I go, pardon me, that ring, that's Scientology, right?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And he turns around, like I just tried to take his wallet from him,

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
and it's really defensive,

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
and this guy does not represent all Scientologists, certainly,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
but he turned around, and it's incredible,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
like almost like a posture of, like, instantly really defensive,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
and I'm like, and I just kind of just pressed right past it,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
and I go, I live in this neighborhood,

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
there's all these Scientology buildings, I've met Scientologists,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I don't know the first thing about it,

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000
and he's like, he's really bummed out, and he turned around,

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
like, can you not tell me about it?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Is that the thing?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
And I'm like, what are you doing, man, what are you doing?

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
And I'm like, I'm just asking about Scientology,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
is it off limits to know?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I said, because if it is, that's fucked up.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Well, to be fair, you were wearing a Guy Fox mask.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Huh?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I said, to be fair, you were wearing a Guy Fox mask.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And later, Hosun.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
And I was carrying a banjo.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
So, you know, he had every reason to not trust me.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Also, he was buying a first aid kit,

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
and he was bleeding profusely from the...

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Right, anyway.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
If you can't be forthright about what it is you believe,

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
then I think you believe something stupid.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Maybe he had just murdered somebody

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
and stole the ring, I didn't know.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Yeah, there should definitely be an open...

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Yeah, I think you got to open your books with the religion, for sure.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Secret religion? It's a little sketchy.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I mean, maybe some things are stupid.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I'll tell you what's not stupid.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Something I take very seriously.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Dungeons and Dragons.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Whoa!

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Spencer, bring us up to date, please.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
On the last episode,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
our heroes were still within the depths of the Infinifish.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
After falling out of a semi-destroyed lung,

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
the team dropped down to the circular chamber below.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
After deciding to carry on,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000
they ran through the next finkter into a large pink room

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
with a large hanging organ in it.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Assaulting the organ with impunity,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
the gang was soon accosted by lightning spidery creatures

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
and fighting those and destroying the organ was the work of a moment.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
After destroying the organ,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
the group stood in a chamber

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
before you, a tangle of fleshy quartz barring your path.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Behind you, the circular chamber you were just in.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Go.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Again, you're...

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I never thought I'd get the timing right on that.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
That was amazing.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
That's an a minute and 32-second track,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
and you managed to go right to the last second every time.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Yeah, that was orgasmic.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
That was really good.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I'm looking like,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
come on, a sweatshirt dripping down my head,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
like, come on, you've got four seconds.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Go.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
We got to clip all these up for, like, my DJ demo reel.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Yeah.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Maybe you've heard this track enough,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
or it's kind of cellular.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
It's completely random every time.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I play a bit to walk you on.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I play a bit to bring Aaron up.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
It's never the same thing twice.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I just marvel at your internal clock on that track.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
It's shocking.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I would say on the bus, if he ever wanted to start his own religion,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
now is the time.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
It's a great city to do it in.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Have you guys heard of fork knots?

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
What?

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
They're little gremlins that cause all the world's problems.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I would like to...

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I should have said this gigs ago,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000
but I really need a case for a Samsung Galaxy Note 2.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
They break very easily,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
but I can't find a case for it in any truck stop or Walmart.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000
If there was any point where I wanted anyone to think that I was a cult leader

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
that was worth giving gifts to,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
if you're listening and you're in Portland...

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Or San Francisco.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
We're so far behind.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
It won't work.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
It won't fucking work.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I should have done that in Brooklyn.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I should have been like, I need a fucking phone case.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I told people I need a shoe goo,

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
and my shoe has been repaired, baby.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
The shoe goo did the job.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Also, I never even met the person that gave the shoe goo,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
so thank you to whoever that was.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Alright.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
So, we're in a room with a...

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
What's that?

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
The smoke sticks.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.000
We're in the lung of the Infinifish, we think,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
and we use the smoke sticks...

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
...to release accurate smoke into the lungs,

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
as well as igniting torches.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Right.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
So we gave the Infinifish emphysema, right?

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Right.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
And then they slashed it to bits.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And then last night, we were in what we think is a kidney,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
and we slashed it, and it was talking about

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
trying to give the Infinifish aids and killing it that way.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
But we didn't know how to...

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I tried to summon an aids-ridden animal,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
but I found out I can't summon animals.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
I can only speak to them, so...

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Yeah.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
What would be the noise for you

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
summoning an aids-ridden animal?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Ho-ho!

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Yeah, here we go.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Yeah, accurate.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
What do you think it's going to be?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Alright, so we have...

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Well, where are we at?

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
There's a thing barring our way with the fleshy cords?

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Yeah, it's like...

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
If you imagine a large thicket of fleshy ropes.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Is this through the third door?

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
You're in the room with the organ.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
If you went back a room, you'd be in that three-door room.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
We're, as Dolly Parton would say,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000
we're two doors down.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Two doors down?

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
We've killed the lung and the kidney,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
and we need to go back.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Presumably, or forward.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I mean, either way.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I say to these guys, I think we need to go back

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
and go through that third door and take out the third thing,

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
because this feels a lot like a video game,

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
or an Irish joke.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Alright, well, I take a swipe at the fleshy cords with my sword.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Several of them are not shatter.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
You know, slice into ribbons.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
It'll take a few more slices, but...

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Can I just do a couple slices and slices?

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Yeah.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Yeah, I just start hacking at the things.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Hacking at the things.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
You reveal a passageway.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Oh, that was easy.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Yeah, sometimes just use your machete to get through the passageway.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I charge headlong into the passageway.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Nice.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I've changed inside this Infinifish,

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
and on this tour, and in this movie about the tour.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
My character's changed.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000
I've changed.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I've become cockier.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I've become...

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
You rush longer-winded?

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
More headlong, and you're rushing?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Yeah.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Alright.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Blasting through the opening,

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
you are met with what appears to be a slippery slope.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Your momentum carries you forward,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
and you slide down the slope.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
I remember Aaron was in this room.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
At the bottom of the slope is a large,

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
orangey-pink slime, translucent and thick.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
We're in the butt.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And inside the monster, you can see a large tome.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
It's thick and appears to be ancient,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
and it's covered in splatters of blood.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Inside the what?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
There's a large blob of slime,

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
as if some sort of monster,

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
but on the inside is a large, ancient tome.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Okay, so that's probably one of, like,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
gelatinous monster of some kind.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Yeah.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
You can see blood seeping out of the book

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
and crawling into the mass of the slime,

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000
branching out like butts and shoots from a branch.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
The book calls to you.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
We should join him.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
The book calls to me?

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Yeah.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
You sense a longing for the book.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Bally high.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Bally high.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
We are joined sharpie.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Near the blood book.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
You slide down the shaft in our joint with sharpie.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000
I do likewise.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
That happens also.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
All right, let's start simple here.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I'm going to use my crossbow, which I never do.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Oh, it's not my thing.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I'm going to give to Mulraine,

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
who I assume has better archery skills than me.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
I'm carrying a thing called Melph's Acid Arrow.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
That's actually a spell.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Oh, okay.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Never mind.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
You can cast it though.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Is that like magic missile?

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Yeah, except it does acid damage

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
and there's a chance that it will do acid damage

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
later on, like damage over time.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Yeah, okay.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
I'm going to try that.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I'm going to try Melph's Acid Arrow.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Is this an organic thing?

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Melph's Acid Arrow?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
No, not Melph.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Melph.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Melph.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
It was a guy.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Summoning a green bolt of noxious acid.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
You fire it directly at the blob.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Choctaw.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Choctaw.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Dealing eight damage.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
It's not great, but you'll take it.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
What is, ma'am?

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I just noticed that I have a sword.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Yeah, you have a long sword and you have weapon finesse,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
which means you're actually quite adroit to it.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Is that the right word?

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Yes.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I shoot two long swords.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Adventure.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Is that a joke?

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
It's not if you have to ask.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Then your bowstring would be sliced.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
I think it's more of a bit.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.000
I take the long sword and I...

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Use it.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Use it.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I slice it towards the book.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
You got a critical hit.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Critical hit!

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Slicing at the slime.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Your tree or sword leaves a clean mark along its surface.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
I had someone tweet at me that I was really bad at Dungeons & Dragons.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I'm not disproving him.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
You're not allowed to be sensitive about that.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I'm not.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Dealing 13 damage.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
You notice that the slime splits in half.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Yeah!

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Fuck you, hazmat46.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Both halves launch their attacks.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
And miss.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Oh nice, we got lucky.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
So now there's two halves of slime?

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Two slimes remain.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Each is about half the size of the former slime that composed the two slimes.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000
The book is on the right hand slime.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I don't get it.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:33.000
So we've passed the book on the right hand slime?

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
This is making me think that I don't know what slime is.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Because the way that it's acting.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
You don't know what swords are.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
It's a large blob of a goop in acid that'll kill you.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Okay, I go into a...

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
What do you call it?

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
What's the one?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I do a power attack.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
One, two, or three?

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Two.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Yep.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
You miss?

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Shit.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm stupid.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
You hit.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Yeah!

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Shit!

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Slimes are really easy to hit.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Alright, it's gonna be...

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
17 damage.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
17 damage, motherfucker.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000
The remaining slime that you slash splits in half, forming two smaller slimes.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Son of a bitch!

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
So we're just making more slimes?

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Yeah, you are.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
They're smaller.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
That's true.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Sharpie, this might be the wrong time to tell you, but...

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Jesus Christ.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
My thoughts exactly, friends.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Oh, that wasn't...

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000
No, I'm sorry.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000
No, I agree.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
You spoke my thoughts.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:41.000
The slimes lurch towards you and strike both Sharpie and Mulrainee with a pseudopod.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Now's a good time to check in with your boyfriend.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
I'll be over here kicking ass.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I'm just gonna say I'm very proud of you, that's all.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Shit.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
The two of you take 11 acid damage.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Oh, man.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I see colors.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Oh, man.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I could always see colors, but...

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Yeah.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I see more.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
I see more.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
I smell them.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Can I ask a quick sidebar, DM?

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Go for it.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Mending, the spell Mending.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Can repair a lightly damaged object.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Do you want to, like, stick this line back together?

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Like, if there's a hole in a boat, that's what that's for.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Or, like, if you sat on your watch.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Do you know what time it is when I sit on my watch?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Darebox time.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Time to get a new watch, Motherfucker.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Oh, damn.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Do I gain hit points from that awesome joke?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
No.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Alright.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Whose turn is it? My turn?

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Yeah.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I mean, I wouldn't...

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Yes, I was thinking maybe for a second,

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
if I use Mending to mend the...

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
If you'd like to.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
That might make sense.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
It's really easy to repair a slime.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
You just kind of smash it back together.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
It's a problem.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Yeah, maybe counterproductive.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000
It's like an asteroid.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Why would you want to remake a big asteroid?

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Because it's easier to dodge a large one.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
But it won't...

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Okay.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
No, I'm just fine.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I'm hearing that I should try this.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Go for it.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I'm going to do it.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I cast Mending on two of these smaller slimes.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Two of the slimes coalesce into a larger form.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
However, that final form seems to be smaller

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
than the sum of the two slime masses.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Ooh.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
It's like math.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Non-Euclidean geometry.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Spencer, may I use Alchemist's fire?

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Yeah.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
With the slime?

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Hurling a bag of Alchemist's fire

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
and you strike the blob directly in its center of mass.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Dealing seven fire damage.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
The blob's now on fire.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Which one did you do?

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
The one with the book or the one without the book?

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000
The slime?

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Yeah, there's two slimes at this point.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Which would be better?

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
The one that you'd like.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I don't want to burn the book.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Okay, cool.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
That slime dies.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Only one half slime is remaining.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
The one with the book?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
The one with the book.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Flaming sword!

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Don't burn the book.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Oh.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
You can extinguish the flames on your sword if you'd like.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I extinguish the flames on my flaming sword.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Now it's just a sword.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
That's a closet sword.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000
It's a straight acting sword.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Yeah, it's very butch.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Yeah, it's a banner sword.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Shirts with sleeves now.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
You slice the book slime and it splits in half,

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
but it also takes 17 damage.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
It appears to be on the ropes.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
How's the book?

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
The book's cool, it's fine.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Magic missile.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I cast magic missile at the slime so as not to hurt the book.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I'm going to resolve slime attacks first.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Resolve them.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Quark, you take 11 damage.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Where's that put my hit points at?

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
You should have been at full.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
I don't think you got hit from any of the spider things.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I took a little bit of damage.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I think I took like 7 or something.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I think 7 from the lightning spider,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
so 7 and 11 would put you somewhere around 22.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000
This is so exciting.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
It really is.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I'm riveted.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Sharpie takes 5 damage.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Lightning spider!

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Okay, so you were casting magic missile?

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Wow!

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I'm just going to play by myself.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Magic missile.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Have faith that it will return to you, Spencer.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I think it's funny if I act like that.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000
It's just a joke.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
But were you going to cast magic missile?

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Yeah, at the book wielding slime.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Firing your magic missiles, they strike true.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
It takes 7 damage.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
It's dead.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
The slime evaporates.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000
You see the book remaining resting on the fleshy ground.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Step back, magic expert.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I go to the book.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I examine it with my magical eyes.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
It appears to be written in some sort of red ink.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Or maybe blood.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
It's actually a language you don't recognize.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000
However, you still seem to feel the power and energy emanating from this book.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Does it feel evil?

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000
It feels not evil, but definitely dark.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Definitely the power of death.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
I touch it.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
You touch it.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
It's a book, right?

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
It feels slightly damp with blood.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000
As you touch it, a bit of blood seeps out of the book onto the ground.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Open it up and check it out, man.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000
I open up to the inside front cover.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
That's the fly leaf.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
It's covered in blood.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I open up to a random page in the middle.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
It seems to be written in red script that you don't recognize.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
It's definitely an old language of some sort.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
It's definitely not a Bissell,

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
or any other sort of demonic language as far as you can tell.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Is it Gnome or Dwarven?

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
It is not Gnome nor...

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Yeah, no.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
I mean...

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I detect magic on it.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
It is intensely magical.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Intensely magic.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Do our little magical shards have any effect on this sort of thing?

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
I don't know.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I whip out a shard.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
You whip out a shard.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000
We all whip our shards out.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000
We compare shard length.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
I only bring out enough shard to win.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000
I pull my leaf skirt down for no reason.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Okay.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
The shards have no reaction.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I approach the book and see if I can read it.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I cling to it tightly.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Okay.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Don't act it out then.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Don't be snatching my book.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Baby, baby, baby.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I don't want to snatch it. I'm just trying to help.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Look with your eyes, not with your hands.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Fine. I look with my eyes.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
You look with your eyes.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000
You see a book. It appears ancient and old and thick and musty.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Can I read the language?

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
You cannot read the language.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I said we take the book and find somebody who can speak this language.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
What are the exits available to us, Spencer?

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Right now, you can only see a sphincter on the floor.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Perfect spot to end, I think.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Butthole cliffhanger!

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Look at it, a sphincter!

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Thank you so much.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Erin McGathy, everyone.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Swordmaster.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Erin, are you selling merchandise out there?

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Oh, I'm so glad you asked.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Spencer and I will be selling merchandise downstairs.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
T-shirts, one for $15, two for $25.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Free smiles, free hugs, lots of love.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Stay true to yourself.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
And depending on what time it is,

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000
so far I have yet to be unable to stay

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000
until I've signed every single thing that people buy.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000
So we may break that record here because we have to leave.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I said we're getting close to wrapping this thing up here.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Oh, of course. Well, that goes without saying.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I mean, I don't want to talk about politics and religion for another 40 minutes.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I just mean, I don't know what time it is.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000
It feels like we did a four-hour show in a good way.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
It's 9.10.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Chicken noodle deck.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Chicken noodle deck and a can for you.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000
There's a sip of some hearty broth

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:01.000
and your lips will froth at the taste of it, my friend.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Chicken noodle deck.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Chicken noodle deck and a...

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000
It's nice and thick.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Let's sing the chicken noodle dick song.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
We didn't sing it in the last night's show in...

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Where were we? Kansas City?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Denver.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
It's all the same.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Here I am.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Ain't got a dick, got a chicken noodle can.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
All my life, I've been puttin' my can.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
It's time for chicken noodle wife.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Chicken noodle guy come down from the mountain saying,

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Chicken noodle man, he gotta work all day.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Chicken noodle man, he gotta cross the river Jordan

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
and feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Soup to the bowl, bowls to the spoon.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Spoon to the mountain, gonna get well soon.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.000
You gotta get some rest and sleep till noon.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Grab a cup of coffee then head to the saloon singing.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Chicken noodle guy come down from the mountain saying,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river Jordan

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
and feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Well the wind blows south and come what may.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000
My chicken noodle wife let me just the other day.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000
There's not much else I can do but pray.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Chicken noodle man, I gotta work all day.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Chicken noodle guy come down from the mountain saying,

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river Jordan

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:26.000
feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Very spiritual in Salt Lake City.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:34.000
It's a town, it's a half Mormon, half secular town.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Half drunk, half sober.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
It makes for good mythology.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
It's like a battery is powerful because it has like,

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000
it's got opposing charges and they're trying to get to each other.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
You can turn that into an alarm clock

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:57.000
waking you up for your job at Verizon.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Yeah but I should do some rapping.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
I should do some fucking hardcore rapping.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
You wanna do a little rapping?

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.000
I gotta, it's not because I want to, it's because they deserve it.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
The people cry out for what they want.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I don't have to look anyone in the eye tonight that says,

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
you didn't rap, I brought my daughter.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
You didn't rap, you didn't rap.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I don't know if you guys have been listening to the podcast

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
but I've been getting really good

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000
and the bar can't be raised high enough.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Let's put your money where your mouth is man.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
I'm not afraid.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
So far so good man.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Yo, yo, went to a lake and its name was Salt.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
The fuck your mama's real hard but it wasn't my fault.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
She came onto me and it wasn't me.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I told her, eat my doodoo and drink my pee and she did.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
So I fucked her.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.000
She did her part, I did mine.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Your mama's so fine, I went down to meet her in the salt mine.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Here in Utah, that's what they do.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.000
They dig deep and pull it out and give it to the world for truth.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Salt.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Turn that frown upside down.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Chloride.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Yellow poop is brown.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Sodium?

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
A simple seasoning right on your table

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
but is it that simple or did Cain slay Abel?

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000
A biblical town but a different Bible.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
An Indian found a book.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Is that libel to cause confusion?

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
There's three books.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Underwear gonna get you dirty looks.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
If it's magical, don't be tragical.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Just communicate like that chick did

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000
and everyone will be fine and like a fraggle.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
It kind of rhymed.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
One more time with the chorus.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Come down to Harmontown.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Utah.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Brown upside down.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Mama.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Yellow poop is brown.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Papa.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Come down to Harmontown.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.000
United States made of all different worlds.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Poison girls going Christmas shopping.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Fucked your mama so hard that her cities were slopping.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Out of her shirt onto the floor and I scooped her mom but said

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
you need these and more.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
You need to take care of yourself.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Mother, go home, raise all my sisters and brothers.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Be a proud woman.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Get a career.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Don't keep fucking me, Dan Harmon.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Stand in here.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Just the Mormons.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Tabernacle.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Turn that brown upside down.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Even X Mormons.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Yellow poop is brown.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.000
X Mormons.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Fleeing from my Mormon faith.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
It was so constrictive I just had to escape.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
It was like Jehovah's Witness and Scientologists.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.000
I grew up under it and couldn't handle it.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Everything your parents tell you, you got to do the opposite.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
But every time you stand back, you might come back to it.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Because it really doesn't matter what you pray to.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
It's all ghosts.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.000
It's just as relevant as what you put on your toast.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Some people put jam.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Some people put jelly.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I listen to Tori Amos.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Some people listen to Belly.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
They're both old bands from the 90s.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
You're all 25.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Sorry that I dated myself.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Turn that brown upside down.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
You could have said R Kelly.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
You could have said R Kelly.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
You could have said Nelly.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Jeff.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Yo, we had a good time tonight.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.000
We had a girl that was Mormon, came up on stage and her hair was ghostly white.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
She had presumably white undergarments on.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
The protector from evil.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I hope she doesn't get attacked by a bull weevil that eats up holes.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
And lets in a pocket of sin.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I know that Mormonism and the Tabernacle is something I'd like to get in

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
and check it out just for a while.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
I think that maybe Brigham Young could make me smile.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Spencer's coming up brown upside down.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
DM.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000
He is a yellow poof.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
His brown rap master.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
My name's Spencer and I'm on the mic.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000
I used to play volleyball so I know how to spike.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000
We just came out here to Salt Lake City.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.000
It's the saltiest place to suck your mama's titties.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000
It's a lot of fun to be up here, I admit.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I think that you all should just submit to my will.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Just start all listening to me and everybody doesn't even have to be free.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000
You're all my slaves.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Thank you Salt Lake City.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Thank you very much everybody.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Me and yellow poop is brown.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Thank you dudes for coming up brown.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Craig, good luck with your job back in Wisconsin.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Or back in Los Angeles right and stuff.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Talitha, our Mormon representative.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Thank you wise guys.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Let's all go out, meet downstairs, get some merchandise, have a drink and say hey.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Oh, we can't have a drink.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
It's illegal here.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Thank you Erin McGathy.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Spencer Crittenden.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
One more time for the mayor of Harmontown.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Dan Harmon everybody.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
God bless you.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Whatever God that may be.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000
I'm gonna walk around with my beer in my hand.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Don't do it Jeff, don't do it.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:22.000
I'm gonna walk to the green room with the beer in my hand.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
This is the sad part of the song.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
He is yellow poop is brown.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000
You
