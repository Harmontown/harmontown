{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:19.000\nSalt Lake City, Utah! Bonsoir! How are you doing tonight, folks?\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:31.000\nThe snow-covered streets of Trolley Square, wherever we are, and the beautifully refurbished\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:36.000\nWise Guys comedy club, Harmontown, is now officially in session.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:40.000\nWould you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:47.000\nYou know him. You might love him. Dan Harmon!\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:55.000\nSalt, salt, salt, salt, take some chloride, take some sodium, salt, salt.\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:59.000\nYou guys love salt, right? Everyone loves salt?\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:06.000\nI was like, okay, there's a guy holding a sign in the audience that says, Utah, 1922, never forget.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:13.000\nWhich I think is like a deep cut reference to our podcast, right? We were making up tragedies at one point.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:19.000\nOkay, we got another one over here. 65,000, Utah, you know what you did.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:24.000\nI don't even remember the reference now.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:29.000\nYou're completely in shadow. Find your light, Harmon.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:41.000\nThe camera guys want me to move back a little bit so that I can make their job of capturing reality a little more artificial.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:52.000\nSorry, my humanity wasn't marketable enough for you, Michelle Gondry.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:53.000\nSo what was the deal?\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:57.000\nYou know, I would have done a show standing in a big shadow.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\nNow we'll never know what that would have been.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:06.000\nI probably would have talked to this guy. He probably has cancer or something.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:12.000\nNow I can't. Everything's fucked up now. But they got their shot, Jeff.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:15.000\nThey're painting with light.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:25.000\nFucking directors. Salt Lake City is about humanity. It's not about film.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:31.000\nYou know, I understand there's people here who fled Sundance to get here, right?\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:37.000\nI heard about your vests, your matching vests and your beards and your Sundance vests.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:45.000\nColorado, fuck Colorado, right?\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:49.000\nThat's where Denver is. Is that where Sundance is?\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:50.000\nWhere's Sundance?\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:51.000\nIt's in Colorado.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:54.000\nOkay.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nIt's up that canyon?\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nIt's in Utah.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:03.000\nAll right, all right. Look, Utah's great. Sundance is okay.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:08.000\nSalt Lake City is the best city in the world. We know that.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:16.000\nAnd salt is the best condiment. Seasoning, whatever you call it.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:21.000\nI know there's like people here, Jeff, they don't like salt being referred to as a seasoning.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:22.000\nDid you know that?\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:23.000\nI did not know that.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:27.000\nThey're offended by that, the way that some deaf people don't like cochlear implants.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:32.000\nYou know, it's like the idea in Salt Lake City is that salt is a meal itself.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:38.000\nAnd that you use potatoes and steak and stuff to make the salt go down better.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:44.000\nIt's a real thing here, you know, this is the salt capital of the world.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:51.000\nTheir roads get real icy and their potatoes get real, real, real, real, real bland.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nAnd they eat the salt.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:59.000\nIt's also the complex drinking law capital of the world.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:02.000\nOh my God, Ron Cuey.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\nComplex, do it again?\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:06.000\nIt's also the what then?\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:10.000\nComplex drinking law corner segments.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:16.000\nAll right, everybody, welcome to Utah, home of the weirdest drinking laws in the world.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nYou don't know them?\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:18.000\nWe've memorized them.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:23.000\nWe've been here for three hours and we've learned one-tenth of the fucking wild ass liquor law you have.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nComplex drinking laws.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:29.000\nLet me explain them.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nJeff, you can't have a double here.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.000\nA double, a double drink?\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:33.000\nYou can't have a double drink.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:34.000\nWhy not?\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nThere is no why, that is the because.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:41.000\nYou can't, it doesn't matter why not.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:47.000\nThere was a, but I'll tell you, Brigham Young, he had huge hands.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:51.000\nSo, and he was very, very ashamed about them.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:58.000\nHe was a wood carver and a philanthropist and a brilliant man, but he had these giant hands.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:04.000\nAnd so they made special big glasses for him to make him feel like his hands were smaller.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nThat was the original BY and BYOB, do you know that?\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:08.000\nYeah.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:12.000\nBig Brigham Young's own bottle.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:20.000\nYeah, because the whole city had to kind of arrange itself around Brigham Young's deformed hands.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:27.000\nAnd so people were like, secretly, people would wear like prosthetic giant hands.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:30.000\nLike that's where those foam number one hands come from.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:34.000\nIt's like, just to make him feel better, because he was a great man.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:37.000\nHe founded a great city and he loved salt.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:43.000\nHe ate so much salt, Jeff, that he retained water in his hands, I think is what...\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:46.000\nHave you ever heard the expression, Matt, as a hatter?\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:50.000\nYou know, that's from the lead lining in Haberdasheries.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:51.000\nMercury lining.\n\n05:51.000 --> 06:01.000\nThere's an expression here called, you know, hands the size of Brigham Young.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:06.000\nSo he had special giant glasses that they would get out for him.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:13.000\nIf you ordered a double here in 1828 when Brigham Young was here, you could die.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:17.000\nLike everyone was drinking out of extra large glasses.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nSo that's why no doubles.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:23.000\nBut it doesn't matter, today it's in honor of temperance.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nAnd that's why the foam hands only hold up one finger.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:26.000\nI'll have one.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nYes, I'll have a single.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nYou want one drink?\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nI don't want two enormous Brigham Young size drinks.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:38.000\nDon't do doubles, said the bartender at the Marriott Hotel.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nThere's something really weird about that, too.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:46.000\nWhen you're at a Marriott Hotel, I'm pretty sure Marriott as a hotel chain probably has\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:52.000\nmore hotels than there are people in certain cities in the United States.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:55.000\nLike as a corporation, it's practically a country.\n\n06:55.000 --> 07:00.000\nAnd it's like, I don't know what's ironic about that, but something is.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.000\nIt's like, you just work at a Marriott.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nGive me the Marriott goods.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:10.000\nIf Utah said I couldn't sleep in a bed, would there be no beds in the Marriott?\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nWhat's in charge here?\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nDoes the money walk or the bullshit talk?\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nI walked into the bar at the Marriott and a nice young lady said,\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nSir, I need to scan your ID.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:25.000\nI'm like, OK, I've never seen that ever.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:30.000\nAnd she took it and then she wrote down every bit of information off of my ID.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nAnd then she put it in a thing and it came out and shredded and then she said,\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.000\nGo fuck yourself.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nI thought that was a crazy lady thing.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nIs that a Utah thing or is that a crazy lady thing?\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nThat's a Utah thing?\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nMaybe crazy ladies are a Utah thing.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nLike lithium's a salt, right?\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nIt's all coming together.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:52.000\nBut also, we were just told that you're not allowed to, in this restaurant,\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nyou're not allowed to be walking around with your drink.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:57.000\nYou have to be seated and eating like chicken wings to have it.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nYeah, we broke the law coming up here.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:03.000\nWe called 911 before we came up.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nWe had to somehow get it.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:09.000\nYou'll notice there's an elaborate trolley system along the walls,\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:15.000\nlike in Mr. Rogers' house, because the wait staff is not allowed to walk while holding liquor.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nSo there's a little choo-choo train that comes by.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:23.000\nAnd they have to technically, they have to pretend that they're here to catch a train.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nAnd then they go, oh, I'm holding a beer.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nAnd then they go, I think this is yours.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:31.000\nThey have to go through so much, and they have to wash their hands, too, on top of it all.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:35.000\nThe only way to get around it is to be in a wheelchair and have a plate of food in your lap,\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:38.000\nand then you can cruise around with a drink.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nIt's complicated, complicated here.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nAre there some other liquor laws that we don't know about?\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nThere's a lot. I work in a bar.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:48.000\nLet's do some.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:54.000\nLet's name Duce up, because his awesome name and his expertise and his...\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:55.000\nHello, Duce.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\nDuce is wearing a crisis alert t-shirt from Community.\n\n08:58.000 --> 08:59.000\nI am.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nAwesome.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:08.000\nSo, Duce, you work in the liquor industry here in the city that invented complicated liquor laws.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:11.000\nSo let's run down some of the more weird...\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:17.000\nOkay, so like this, this is considered a restaurant, so you have to have food to get a beverage.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nIn a bar, you can get beverage by itself.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:25.000\nYou can't have a double, but you can have two different kinds of liquor in front of you.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nSo you can order a tequila and a rum.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nThat's fine, but not a rum.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nCan I order two tequilas? No, I can't.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nNo, but you can get tequila and a rum.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.000\nBecause they saw five easy pieces, and they were like,\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:38.000\nokay, we're not gonna let a Jack Nicholson figure it out.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nLike, I'd like to give me two tequilas then, and I'll...\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nOoh, look what I'm doing.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:43.000\nLike, they figured that out.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nYou can hold the ice between your knees.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:50.000\nOkay, so if I have food in a restaurant, can I have a double?\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nNo, nope, still can't.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\nI can never have a double, ever.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nYou can never have a double, unless you're at home.\n\n09:55.000 --> 10:00.000\nBut I was at Subway at a Utah gas station, and I got double meat on my...\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:04.000\nThat's a stupid comment, though.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nAll right, well, give us another one.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:07.000\nIs there...\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:11.000\nLet's see, you can only have two ounces of liquor in a drink.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:15.000\nSo, you know, even if it's like a Long Island, which has all kinds of different liquors,\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nyou can still only have two ounces worth of liquor.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:18.000\nOh, total?\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:19.000\nTotal.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nOh, so you order a Long Island iced tea, and you can...\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nIt's bullshit.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nLike, yeah, does it come in a Dixie cup?\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nUsually, yeah.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:28.000\nIt comes in plastic here.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nAll right, well, let me...\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:34.000\nMaybe instead of just asking you to list the stuff off, let's just do an exercise.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:37.000\nYou be a bartender, I'll be a customer.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:43.000\nOh, what a rough day of being an American citizen that's supposedly allowed to do whatever the fuck I want to do.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:51.000\nAnd having to put up with an ownership class of rich people that have 1% of whatever the 99% thing plan plan.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:58.000\nI'm so stressed out, I would like to numb my brain with a legal substance that makes everyone around me smarter\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:02.000\nfor a couple hours, a couple blessed fucking hours.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:07.000\nCan I please have a Kettle One on the rocks with no lime?\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nAnd...\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nOkay, so the answer is yes, but then...\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nYes, sir.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:15.000\nThen you fill the glass with ice, and you fill it up like I've noticed...\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nIt's a thimble fold.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nIt's one ounce of...\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:24.000\nOkay, so I get it, and I go, okay, I'm going to slide this $5 bill across the table.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.000\nOh, my.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nHey, can I...\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:30.000\nCan I actually make it a double if we're going to be this way?\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:35.000\nThen I'd look around, see if the DABC was in the house, and then I go...\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nIs he a rapper?\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nYeah.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nNo, that's the beverage counselor or whatever.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:43.000\nYeah, Department of Alcohol Beverage.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:47.000\nYeah, it's ridiculous, because I actually send spies in a lot to us.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nRight, secret drinkers.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nYeah, they really do, they really do.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:56.000\nLots of underage kids being like, come on, man, here's 20 bucks, let me in the bar.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nRight, well, that's everywhere.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:02.000\nDoes an Irish guy walk in and go, ah, we're shutting you down, deuce.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nOh, my God.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nWe're shutting you down.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nJesus Christ, Jeff, you know who would hate it in Salt Lake City?\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:08.000\nJerry McSeinfeld.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:09.000\nJerry McSeinfeld.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:14.000\nStay here, deuce, stay here.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:17.000\nOh, I'm Jerry McSeinfeld.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nI'm an Irish Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:24.000\nI'm famous for my observational material and my Irish heritage.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:30.000\nSo you can imagine, I'm quite puzzled by the state of affairs in your little bird.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nWhy can't I have a double?\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nWe've been over that.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nI'm Jerry McSeinfeld.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:40.000\nWhy is it so snowy outside?\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:46.000\nAnd why in such an inhospitable climate would you want to make it even harder to drink?\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nWhat's happening?\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:52.000\nWhy do you want people to move away so bad?\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:55.000\nWhy you're always closing all the roads so we can't escape?\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:56.000\nAye, sir.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:57.000\nThat's the exact reason.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:58.000\nOh, my God.\n\n12:58.000 --> 12:59.000\nIt's me.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nIrish Tim Allen.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nIt's Irish Tim Allen.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:08.000\nHo, ho, ho, ho.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nIrish Tim Allen, what did you do today?\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:14.000\nWe went on tool time, sir.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:17.000\nHe talked to me neighbor Wilson.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:21.000\nHe's a little Scottish.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:24.000\nIrish Tim Allen is a pirate.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:28.000\nDon't judge Salt Lake City.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nYou live on a salt lake.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nWhy is it a salt lake?\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nWhy would you want to put salt in a lake?\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nThe worst place for it.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:38.000\nOh, sir.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nI fixed that with me tool time supplies.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nOh, I'm Irish Seinfeld.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:47.000\nAnd he's Irish Tim Allen.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:52.000\nAll right, thank you, Deuce.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nDeuce, everybody.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:57.000\nI thought that Irish Seinfeld would have a lot more material\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:00.000\nhere in Salt Lake City, but he actually doesn't.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:03.000\nHe actually, this is the city that puts me and Irish Seinfeld\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\non the same page.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nAnd everybody, because he's like,\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:08.000\nwhy can't you have a double?\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:09.000\nThat's it.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nWhy can't you have a double?\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:13.000\nJust put a billboard outside as you enter the,\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:16.000\nis that a statewide thing or a city thing?\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nA statewide.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nOkay, so as you cross the border to Utah,\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\njust put up a big billboard that says,\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nnot you can't have a double.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:26.000\nSay, why can't you have a double?\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:31.000\nAnd then the answer underneath it will say,\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nbecause we love you.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:37.000\nAnd they have like a black lady with a baby.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nSomething to make it.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nIs there anybody here that's from Utah\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nthat still manages to get drunk occasionally?\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nIs there anybody here that's a drinker?\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:48.000\nDoes it keep you from getting drunk?\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:52.000\nI imagine, Jeff, that the alcoholism is rampant here.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nAmong the youth.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:56.000\nI saw SLC punk.\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:00.000\nWith Shaggy.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nWhen I was like, I don't know, 16, 15,\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nI think I was like 15 years old in high school.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:08.000\nWe came up to Utah from Southern California\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\non a ski trip.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nSo we went to like Park City and Snowbird\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nand you got a pair of Alto or Alto, whatever.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:16.000\nYeah, it's great.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nBest to know in the world.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nAnd we had no booze.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nWe were all 16, 15 year olds.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nAnd I was kind of like a huckster.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nI was like a shoplifter and a bad person\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nand a burglarizer and stuff.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:31.000\nI was commissioned to go out and get the alcohol.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nSo I went to a hotel and it was a really cool\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nlike little liquor store in the lobby of a hotel.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nBut it was just like liquor.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:38.000\nLike no beers, no nothing.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nIt was just like a really old time like\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nChandler novel kind of thing.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nLike an old hotel with a booze department in it.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nAnd they probably had like a house dick\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:49.000\nwalking around, you know, like busting people.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nAnd I went to the guy and I was skinny,\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\na little 15 year old.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nHe was like, hey, my dad's having a big party\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nwith a bunch of his asshole friends up in the room\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nand they're too drunk to come down.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nHe sent me down to buy this stuff.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:03.000\nHere's his list.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nAnd I just put this piece of paper in front of him.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nHe was like, oh wow, that's clever thinking of him.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:10.000\nSo it's like, I just bought like just bags and bags\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nand bags and bags of booze.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nAnd his response was, well, that's a good idea of your father.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nI never thought of sending the kid down.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:17.000\nWhat a good idea.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nIt's good, yeah.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nA human shield.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nI came back.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:23.000\nI was like Alexander the Great when I came back around.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nThere was Trump.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:28.000\nThere was a lot of booze.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:31.000\nThe waiter, Marcus, came over to Deuce\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nand started whispering something to him.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:34.000\nAnd I thought he was going to,\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:37.000\nI thought the SWAT team was going to come in\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nand stop talking to them about the liquor laws.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:43.000\nBy the way, I filled up a glass of Grey Goose up here.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:46.000\nI'd say, is this like a sword swallowing act to you guys?\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:50.000\nLike, am I like Mel Gibson and Beyond Thunderdome\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:51.000\nwith the kids?\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nLike, oh, the pocket clips.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nOh, fly, fly, pilot man.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:58.000\nHe has a full glass of liquor in his hand.\n\n16:58.000 --> 16:59.000\nAll right.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nI'm not man, it's not you guys.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nIt's the fucking government.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:07.000\nAnd by government, we mean the ghosts of like weird,\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:10.000\nlike it's got to be like some guy in the 1800s\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nwas like, well, they can't have doubles\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nbecause every time I have a double,\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nI know I want to rape people\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nbecause I'm a vile person that makes laws\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nand I make them because I ask myself,\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nwhat would I like to do today\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nif I could do anything I wanted to do?\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nWell, I'd eat that little girl\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nand I'd own those black people\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:33.000\nand I'd hit them when they did something wrong\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:37.000\nand I'd clobber my wife over the head with a shovel\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nand like barrier in the backyard.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:42.000\nWe got to start like making laws against this stuff\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nbecause they're making the mistake of going,\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:48.000\noh, everyone's a vile old prick in the world\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nand it's just, that's the problem.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nThat's why we have to figure out, Jeff,\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nthe Constitution for Harmontown\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nand it has to be like a little piece of code.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nIt has to just be a very simple,\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\ngot to figure it out before we get back to LA.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nI think it's do what you want.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nIt is do what you, it's everyone gets to do what they want.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nYou got to say it like that.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nYou got to say it, it's Jeremy Kramer's old bit,\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\ndo what you want.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nIt's like the mafia.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:14.000\nEveryone gets to do whatever they want\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nunless it interferes with someone else's ability\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nto do whatever they want.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:21.000\nDot, dot, dot, question mark.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nI don't know what to put in there.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nIf two people both want to do something\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nand they can't both do it without one of them\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nhaving to do something they don't want\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nor not getting to do whatever they want,\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:35.000\nthen you engage in a ritual called patty cake.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nWell, I think back in the old days,\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:41.000\nmanors were, there was a high premium on courtesy\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nand people opened doors for each other\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\nand people helped old ladies across the street\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nand put cloaks over puddles and stuff like that.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nI don't know if they really did.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nThat might just be in a book.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nBut maybe they just had more cloaks back then.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nThey didn't care as much.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nNow, I guess we have evolved technologically\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nand we evolve as a species.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:02.000\nCourtesy seems just to be something that's dying.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nIt's devolving.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nThe whole thing comes down to,\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nyeah, I want to do this, but I want to smoke a cigarette,\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:09.000\nbut these people might not want it,\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nand someone walks over and politely goes,\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nhey, man, can you not smoke a cigarette?\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nYou know, I'm sorry.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nI'll take it outside.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nHave a human conversation about it.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:21.000\nBe adults. Have some common courtesy.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nYeah, but then there's this rise\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nof the passive-aggressive mutant,\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nlike somebody who's cool\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nbut is always getting what they want,\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nleveraging people socially.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nYou have to protect against...\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nThen you tell that person you're being a dick. Shut up.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nWell, then that person can also say\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nyou're being a dick for not giving a...\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nThere needs to be a little bit of a foolproof.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:44.000\nI understand the whole idea is be cool.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nBut it's got to have...\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nHere's my theory.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:51.000\nThere's got to be a way to back the dollar\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:54.000\nwith human life instead of, like,\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\na mythical piece of gold in Fort Knox\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:59.000\nor a stock or the dollar itself\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nor pride in your country.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:04.000\nIf you were able to back a nation's currency,\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nbecause currency is going to be useful\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nstill for a little while.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nWe can't all become hippies and run around\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nand kiss gazelle or something.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nWe've got a hundred years left of still needing poker chips\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nto get through our day, to make transactions.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:19.000\nI say, though, you can back that currency with...\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nIt's like a video game.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nWhen you're playing a video game,\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nthere are video games where you're walking down the street\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nand then there's a thing that goes,\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nsomeone needs help and then you go and help them\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nand then you get some bonus points.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nAnd there are actual points that you can use\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nto get a bigger gun and blow the fuck out of something.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:38.000\nIt's shit that you can use to make yourself cooler.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nAt the very least, when you show up...\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nI've discussed this before.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nIf I'm walking down the street\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nand there's a guy laying on the sidewalk\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nin a puddle of his own piss\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nand I'm like, I had a bad day today, can you help me out?\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nMy reason for not stopping\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nand having a conversation with him\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nand seeing how I can help him is I'm late for lunch.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nI got shit to do. I got a script to finish.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nI got all this stuff to do.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nAnd the reason I got to finish my script\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nor be on time to lunch with my friend,\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nall that stuff just has to do with capitalism, really.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nIt just has to do with, like,\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:11.000\nokay, I'll end up like him if I help him.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:14.000\nI'll end up like him if I help him.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nSo all you have to do is reverse that\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nand say, if I help him,\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:20.000\nthe opposite.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nSo that when we see a guy laying\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nin the middle of the sidewalk in a puddle of his own piss,\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nwe go, holy shit, I can't believe I found one.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nLike, this is like a hidden package\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nin Grand Theft Auto.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nI just stumble. Do you know how rare these are?\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nPeople who need my help?\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nI'm rich!\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:38.000\nAnd because if I help him,\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:40.000\nthen it's like, I get points.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nI get a power-up of some kind.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nAnd then because\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nthe whole country works that way,\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nwe're the most powerful country in the world\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nbecause all the other countries go, like,\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\noh, that country where everybody's,\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nfuck, nobody's laying on the sidewalk\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nin their own piss.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nThey all just, every time someone\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nstarts to have a bad day,\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\neight people jump on him and help him\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:04.000\nso that they can profit off of it karmically.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nAnd so everyone lives in a fucking, like,\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\npenthouse over there. Everyone's, like,\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:10.000\nfloating around.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nYou're talking about destroying capital.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nNow, like, so if you replace\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nhelping people with capital, like,\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nthe whole point is that we've got to a place\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nwhere capital is the whole point.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nAccumulation of wealth is the definition of success.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nCompetition is a good thing.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nYou know, getting ahead of other people.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nYeah, but, but, like,\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\na couple thousand years ago,\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nthe definition of poor was, you know,\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nyou lived until 25\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nif someone didn't come into your house,\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nstab you in the face and fuck the stab-hole.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nLike, that's not\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nwhat it means to be poor anymore.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nNow being poor means you eat a Big Mac\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nout of a dumpster and you have a coat\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nthat someone gave you.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nLike, you're still walking around without a house\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nand you get fucking cold and you die sooner.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nBut, like, the\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\ndefinition of\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nthe 99% keeps going up.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nWe can increase that\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nby a thousand fold.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nThat's my theory. I'm no economics professor.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nBut I don't think that capitalism\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nnecessarily, yes, it means\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nthat there's, like, a pyramid in place\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nand that there's a competition in place.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nBut why can't the poorest person\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nin the world\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:18.000\nhave, like, a giant TV\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nand get to play video games and...\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nOh, it could, but it profits none.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nYou know, enough food goes to waste every day\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nto feed almost everybody and, you know,\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nthere's certainly enough housing and clothing for everybody,\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nbut prices have to be at a certain place.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nWe have to make sure that rich, white, gross people\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\ncontrol shit.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nThey don't have to be.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nThat's been the easy way to do it,\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nyou know, and it's all\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nkind of falling apart anyway.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nLike, rich people, like, there's a\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nshorter path to, like, you know,\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nkeeping poor people poor.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nThat's what makes sense to a rich person.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nBut, like, if you challenge them,\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nthey tend to\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nfigure you shit out.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nThe thing that bumps me out is, like, a room like this.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nThere's no government in here.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nThis is the proper definition of anarchism.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nI mean, there's nobody ruling anybody here.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.000\nAnd it's like, I'm Jesus Christ.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nI'm gonna shit on my hand and throw it at you.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nNo cop can help me.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nLike, like,\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nthat guy, that guy becomes in charge.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nHe's Bane now.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nOh, I'm, I'm,\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.000\nI'm headlining at wise guys.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nLike, I'm the new Kevin Neelan.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nThere's a lot of\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nKevin Neelan pictures.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nKevin, Kevin Neelan is there.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nIs Kevin Neelan a part owner here?\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nDid Kevin Neelan, like,\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\ncreate a dying pregnant woman here?\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nSee, I think in the middle of his act,\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\na woman was like, I'm six months pregnant\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nand chunking on a hot wing.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nAnd he's like, excuse me.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nAnd, like, just brought her back to life\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nand gave her $1,000.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nKevin, Kevin, before you go,\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nhow can we repay you?\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nYour thanks is enough.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nNo, how can we repay you?\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nPut up 400 photos in the end.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nCreate a system of laws in my name\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nthat make it hard to drink.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nI am the Neelan.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nHe's like the Stargate guy.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nHe'll come back every once in a while\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:08.000\nand suppress literacy.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nBut he gets worshipped here.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nAnyways, like, if that guy,\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nif a guy stood up and, like,\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nfucking tried to choke me to death,\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nyou would be the people\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nthat helped me.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nYou would save me, possibly.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nAnd vice versa.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nLike, we have weight staff here.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nMaybe we have a bouncer here.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nWe have, you know, we...\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nThese are all private, anarchic roles.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:34.000\nLike, we put...\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:36.000\nYou need a bouncer and you need a white person\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nand you need a club owner\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nand you need a performer and you need an audience.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nWe're not animals.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nWe know how to fucking behave ourselves.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nWe don't need a fucking senator\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nto tell us, like, what left from right is.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nThose are the only people\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nthat don't ever do anything.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:54.000\nIt just fucking confounds me.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nWe've created a new society\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nwhere we...\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nYou know how, like, bees,\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nthey raise their own royalty.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nThey're just sitting there as larvae.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nYou could fucking eat them.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nLike, and then these queens hatch\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nand then they sting the other queens to death\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.000\nand then they take over and these poor soldiers\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:14.000\nare just like, oh, thank God we have a queen again.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:16.000\nLike, I understand\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nthe desire for comfort and leadership,\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nbut in America,\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nthe idea that was that we...\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nthose people are civil servants.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nYou're not wearing a crown.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nYou're wearing a clip on tie.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nGet to work, motherfucker.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nSo I can go do the shit I enjoy.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nI want to be a radio DJ.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nI want to be a dentist.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nI want to dig a ditch and then, like, punch a clock\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nand not worry about shit from 8 p.m.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nto 6 a.m.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nSome people might prefer doing that shit.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nNone of us want to balance the budget\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nand make the garbage trucks run on time.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:50.000\nThat's why we elect officials.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nThe president is supposed to be\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\na fucking dipshit civil servant.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nHe's not supposed to be someone\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nthat we cower in the presence of\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nand most importantly,\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nthat people literally murder\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\nand cheat and lie and steal\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nto try to become, because they have the most

And they were like actually\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\npretty accurate compared to if you just\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nlooked at the person and tried to form a judgment.\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nInteresting.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\nGranted, our noses as primates have been\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\ntotally shut down.\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:22.000\nThat's why we're blown away by dogs and cats\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.000\nbecause we used to have snouts like\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:26.000\nthat.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\nOur eyes moved forward to the\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nfront of our head to get stereoscopic color\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nand all this equipment\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nall this computer equipment up behind\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.000\nyour nose like that had to get\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:38.000\nliquidated and like sold\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nand shut down.\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:42.000\nOur noses compared to dogs are like\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\ndogs noses are pretty much\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\ntheir eyes. Dogs smell\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\nas much as we see\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nand they just use their eyes\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nto not bump into a wall\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nand kind of zero in on the butthole\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nto smell.\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nBut then that butthole is like\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\na Facebook page.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:02.000\nI'm not the first person\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nto bring this up at Wise Guys\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nin Salt Lake City.\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:08.000\nI'm sure Kevin Nieland's got 20 minutes on this.\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nBut there's a wealth\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nof information they get out of that\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\nbut all we get is it smells\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nlike poop. But\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nthat being said I think there is more to smell\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nthan we are used to\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nexperiencing.

had to resign just because\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nWisconsin has got some real bad habits.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nWisconsin has horrible things going on\n\n45:52.000 -->

man.\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nHave you considered the Dan Harmon lookalike\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.000\ncontest that's happening?\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\nI think it's tomorrow night\n\n46:06.000

46:28.000\nWow.\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nWho are your glasses for a second?\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nSure.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nSo Craig tell me about your job.\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nHey look I was a teacher\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nfor 20 years Dan\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nand Wisconsin's fucked up.\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nNow I'm looking\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nfor more work.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nTell us Craig.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\nI was going to say while Craig was Dan\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nI was going to make him rap.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.000\nCraig can you\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:56.000\nYeah.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nWe'll build up to it.\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nI want to hear about this Wisconsin thing\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\nbecause I keep hearing about it.\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nIt's my home state shit is fucked up there.\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nSpecifically it's more fucked up.\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nEducation\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nit's a hot button\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nit's a liberal thing but it's also so\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nfucking true.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nIt's one of the cheapest things\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nthat we could be spending money on.\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nI love the kids too man.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nI love the kids but there's so many rules\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\nthat are not working.\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:26.000\nIt's so easy to suck money out of that\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nout of that sector and it makes\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nno sense.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nIt only makes sense to creepy rich people\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nbecause they don't get rich the next day\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nby putting any money into the idea\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nlike yeah but it happens so fast\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:40.000\n20 years from now you're going to feel that\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nyou're going to have to do this\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nit's like the first thing you're going to\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:46.000\ndo is you tell us what's going on in Wisconsin\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.000\nthat has to do with unions and stuff\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:50.000\nYeah they kind of busted up the unions\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.000\nfor the teachers and\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\nnow the administrators of all the\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nschool districts can make up their own\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:58.000\nset of rules.\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nSo I'm not supposed to speak about this\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nbut I had 40 kids in my classroom\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nto try to teach art to at once\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nand it's like 40 kids is a lot of kids.\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\nThat was part of the course when I was\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nI went to Marshall High\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:12.000\nbefore I went to Brown Deer\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\nand I was like was it 6,000\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\n4,000 kids\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nand then I went to the suburbs and it was\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:20.000\n600 kids and it was like\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\n15 or 20 kids in a class but\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nwhen I was in Milwaukee public schools\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nthere would be 30, 40 kids in a class\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nespecially in an art class where it's like\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\noh you have to take art we don't want to spend\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nany money on it.\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:34.000\nYou just six kids to a paint brush\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nbecause who's going to enforce this?\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:38.000\nSo again we had 30, 40 kids in my class\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\nand I barely remember\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:42.000\nthat teacher's name because you got no\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\npersonal interaction with like we're all\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nmaking clay you know statues and stuff like that\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:48.000\nthere was no input, there was no connection at all\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:50.000\nand so you end up doing a thing\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:52.000\nand you get a grade on it but you don't know what you did\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:54.000\nyou don't know why you did it, there's no\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\ninteraction at all, there's no\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nnurturing or mentoring at all.\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nThat must be especially hard on an art teacher\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:02.000\nwhere it's all about expression.\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nWell you want them to be unique right?\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nAnd what not so...\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nYeah there are human beings like you have no idea\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nlike we obviously we\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nin a grand scheme of things what happened is\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nwe know that education is important\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nwe know that our kids have to go to school\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nand then all of a sudden this becomes like this\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nwe have to have\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nthis system so it's like and then\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nhow do you allocate funding\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nto this system?\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nBecause it's not socialism\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nit's the government funds\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nthis thing so how much should we fund it?\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\nWhat are your test scores in this school?\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nOkay so if our test scores\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\nare this then we get this amount of

58:44.000\nIt's so bad that I found a cartoon.\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:46.000\nThanks for pointing that out.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:48.000\nOh my God.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nHe's a Harmonian.\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:52.000\nWe have a list when you have an S in your name.\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:54.000\nThat's a bummer.\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:56.000\nAlright, sorry.\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:58.000\nHer name might be Talitha.\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:00.000\nThat's a joke I was making.\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.000\nBut no, it's Eurythra, right?\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:04.000\nRight.\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.000\nYou're our first Mormon that I know of.\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:08.000\nI don't know if anyone was a closet Mormon\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:10.000\nthat we've had on the show.\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:12.000\nWe're in the Mormon capital of the country.\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:16.000\nI don't know what to ask.\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.000\nWhat do we do with the Mormon, Jeff?\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:20.000\nI don't know.\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.000\nIt occurs to me that I really know nothing\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:24.000\nabout Mormonism except the\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:26.000\nMormon families that were in my high school.\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:28.000\nI know that they were very tightly knit,\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nvery large families generally,\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:32.000\nand very close.\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:34.000\nThey had their little home evening\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:36.000\nor what do you call that?\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nFamily home evening?\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\nDo you still do that with your family?\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:42.000\nAre you coming from a large family as well?\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:44.000\nI do.\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:46.000\nWell, I have a pretty big family\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:48.000\nand I don't know\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nby whose standards,\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:52.000\nbut I've got...\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:54.000\nI actually have five kids\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:56.000\nand I'm 31.\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:58.000\nWow, hey.\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nThat's a big deal because, Jeff,\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nwhat I've heard about Mormons is that you all get your own planet\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nin the afterlife.\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nThat's one of the eight things that I've heard about Mormonism\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nis that part of the scheme of the afterlife\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000\ninvolves your own world.\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nI've had three kids\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nand then we adopt two kids, too.\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nThat's pretty common.\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nAre these things like caricatures?\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nRemember when 9-11 happened?\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nAll the ticker tape on CNN could talk about\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nis the 70 virgins because everyone wanted to know\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nwho would do this, why would they do it?\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nThat was the talking point.\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nLet's find the weirdest, silliest sounding thing\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nabout Islam that we can\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nand just repeat it over and over again.\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nWell, they think in heaven that your dick is a pine tree.\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nYou know, like,\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nhey, they already blew up a building.\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nWe already hate them.\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nWhy did they do it?\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nI'm just wondering, like,\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nbecause Christianity\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nhas all kinds of weird shit about it\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nthat if you've focused in

do we talk about? Magic Underwear I've heard?\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nI've heard about the planet\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nthat everyone gets when they die\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nand...\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nAnd no coffee.\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nNo coffee?

She looks very cool.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nI'm telling the podcast audience\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nthat sounded patronizing.\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nShe's actually really...\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nIf you had a podcast audience you were\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000\ncasually reporting to, you would sound sarcastic sometimes,\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000\nlike the person at the bank would go,\n\n01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nyou can't have your money, I go,\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nI can't have my money, folks, it's just the way it works here.\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000\nMagic Underwear,\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000\nwhat does that mean? I've heard that\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nphrase, Magic Underwear.\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nI'm sure that's speaking\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nin terms of\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000\na clothing garment\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nthat LDS people wear.\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nRight.\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nLDS is Latter-day Saints, so that's the church,\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nthe name of the church.\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nNo, nothing magic.\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nIt's symbolic.\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nRight.\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nWhat is it? Is it about chastity?\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nPartly, yeah.\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000\nIt's symbolic of...\n\n01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nGet really specific, because I swear to God,\n\n01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nI've heard that phrase,\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000\npeople who are hating on Mormons, they go,\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000\nthey have magic underwear.\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nThey believe in magic underwear.\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nThey believe in Malaamari.\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nSo,\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nknowing that that's all I've heard,\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nthat's all I've heard, like, what does that mean?\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nAnd I also haven't seen\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nthe Trey Parker Mattsnown musical.\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nI don't know anything.\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nI don't know how to\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nget into it without having like a whole\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000\ndiscussion about, you know,\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000\nall the fundamentals, but...\n\n01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nLet's do it.\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000\nWe got all night.\n\n01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nI don't know if this is the right form.\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nWe have a Neelan's here on Tuesday, but...\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nI can get the missionaries here in about five seconds.\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nWe already burned through a fart corner. We got nothing left.\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nI was hoping to get farted on.\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nWell, is there fear of getting it wrong, of sounding like you're misrepresenting your religion?\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nOr is there fear of people that aren't affiliated, like, judging you?\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nOr is it just a fear of making the podcast six hours long because it's that complicated?\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nNo, no. I mean, the gospel is simple.\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nIt's a Christian gospel.\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nRight.\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nSo it's the Church of Jesus Christ of Lottery of Saints.\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nThere were more books later, like, in the New World.\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nOh, yeah, yeah. You're familiar.\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nBooks written at the same time that, yeah.\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000\nBut the underwear, like, you can't...\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nYou don't want to cartoonify your religion, but...\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nIf you go back to, like, in the Old Testament, the book of Exodus and things like that,\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nthey talk about when they go to the temple and putting on the holy garment.\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nSo it's the same type of thing. It's symbolic of certain covenants you make at the temple.\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nSo this is not a sexual thing at all. This is not about...\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nNo!\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000\nOh, see, like, you know, Orthodox Jews, like, there's some sects of Judaism\n\n01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nwhere they have sex through a hole in a blanket or whatever?\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nBecause everyone has their own, you know, old religions.\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nThey have old, old ideas about sex that are...\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nI thought when I heard magic underwear, I automatically assumed it was some kind of, like...\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nThat you wore during...\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nYeah, there was, like, didn't have a flap in it or something.\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nSo that when you were 16, you got a flap, or...\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nAnd then you get to go to prom.\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nAnd Talitha, I'm assuming you're not wearing it now.\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nYou wear it when you go into the temple, right?\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nNo, at all times.\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nSo it's like a yarmulke, or, I mean, they don't...\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nSo you wear it all the time?\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nAre you wearing it now?\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nI am, yeah.\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nAnd it's about, like, a yarmulke is about, like, humbling yourself before God.\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nLike, you're covering your head. It's a symbolic, like, God-fearing thing.\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nSo this underwear is covering your...\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nSo symbolic of...\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nWell, starting, like, your body is, like, your temple.\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nYour body is your gift from God. It houses your spirit.\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nSo your body is kind of like your most sacred physical possession, I guess.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nWhere do you go?\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nAnd the fundamental level, no matter what you're doing out in society, underneath it all,\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nis your relationship with the cosmos.\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nI mean, this is like, when I was a kid, we had a thing called Underoos.\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nThat where the...\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nThey're sacred to you.\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nWell, I mean, in a secular sense, yes, sacred.\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nI'm getting picked on. I'm getting a swirly.\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000\nBut I'm the Hulk down here.\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nThey just don't know it. I'm Aquaman.\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nYou know, I have a relationship with...\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nWith, you know...\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000\nThat doesn't sound... Magic underwear.\n\n01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nSee, people are too...\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nYeah, we trivialize stuff.\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nBut also, people are very freaked out by other people's spirituality and stuff like that.\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nSo we do the opposite of trivializing it, right?\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nWe make it into too big a deal, because every single little thing,\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nlike religious traditions and rituals,\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nare little, tiny, little things that sometimes have practicality\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nand sometimes don't, but in all cases are designed\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000\nto remind the individual in a world where God's not hanging out all the time\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nthat God is a part of their life, that they have a relationship with the unknown.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nAnd scientists get to punch a clock at work every day.\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nTheir job is to study the unknown and figure shit out\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nso they don't need magic underwear to remind them.\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nBut if you work at Verizon, there's a lot of people\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nthat are going to try to make you think that you should worship Verizon\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nand they should go fuck themselves if you're a Mormon,\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nbecause when you go home at night, you're beholden to this other thing.\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nDo you go to a store to get them? Do you make them yourself?\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nHow do you...\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nIt's an authorized store, yeah.\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nSo the church makes them.\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nYeah, it's like an authorized pattern.\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nIt's like kosher food.\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nThere's some factory somewhere where there's a rabbi going like,\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nthis hot dog's good to go.\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nIt's an authorized pattern.\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nDon't answer this if you don't want to. I'm not being creepy.\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nWhat do they look like? What part of your body?\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nWhat physically?\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nHuh?\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nGranny underwear?\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nJust like from here to here.\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nReally?\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nLike an old tiny swimsuit?\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nNo, just like a shirt and shorts.\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nI still make one piece.\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nI hope everyone else got their buddy's words, but I certainly do.\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nI'm glad I finally learned about the magic underwear thing.\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nLet's say you go to the beach. Let's say you're taking a swim in the Salt Lake.\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nWhat do you... Do you swim in the Salt Lake?\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nYou're taking a float in the Salt Lake.\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nYeah, then you would just not wear them for activities that wouldn't...\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nGotcha.\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nThat you couldn't normally do without.\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000\nLike, so, you know, if I'm going swimming or going to work out or...\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nAll right.\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nYou got five children. You can have any more. Is that the limit?\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nI'm not coming on to you, by the way.\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nYou have sexy hair. We want to know about your underwear.\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nLet's make it around six.\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nI'm drawing conclusions.\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nHow fertile are you?\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nOkay, well, yeah, I keep thinking, like, oh, there's a big wrap-up question,\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nbecause I don't want to just have brought you up and talked about underwear,\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nbut communication is always a fucking thing.\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nLike, I'm obsessed with race, you know, all the time.\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nI grew up in the 70s. It's like, when I was a kid on the playground,\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nI was like one white kid and I'd be surrounded by a bunch of black kids.\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nAnd, like, I remember back then it was the 70s,\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nand, like, we were coming off our Norman Lear sitcoms,\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000\nand everyone was talking about the fact that people were different,\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nand you'd have conversations, and you'd go up to a black kid and you'd go,\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000\ncan I touch your hair?\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nWhat does it feel like?\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nAnd, overall, you wouldn't know, because people were communicating,\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nbecause, like, that's the human gift, is to communicate.\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nAnd then, like, somebody's saying, oh, they have magic underwear over Calamari,\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nand then that's all I hear, and then, like,\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nall of the problem is in everything that's not explained.\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nLike, it actually doesn't sound very weird at all,\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nand it doesn't sound very magical, either.\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nOr, yeah.\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nSounds like ritualistic, ceremonial.\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nYeah, it's ceremonial, symbolic.\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nDoes it have a big M on it?\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nYeah, that's Mario, that's Mario, I'm sorry.\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nWell, let's have a hand for our Mormon representative.\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nThank you, Talitha.\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nThank you.\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nThank you.\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nI was hoping I could get farted on.\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nYou want to get farted on?\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000\nI was hoping.\n\n01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nAll right.\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nYou want the music?\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nYes, please.\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nHang on, hang on, that's good.\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nOh, sorry, sorry.\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000\nPretend I didn't do that.\n\n01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nThat didn't count.\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nTalitha wants the music.\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000\nFart corner!\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000\nReligious edition.\n\n01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000\nAll faiths from corner to corner.\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nEveryone's going to get farted on.\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nThat's a gear and a torner.\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nMade up a new word that I can do that.\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nHuman beings can make up words and religions.\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000\nThat's our talent.\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nThat's what we do.\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nIt's called mythology, so scoop-de-doo!\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nYeah!\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nFart it on a Mormon!\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nFart it on a Mormon!\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nTalitha, everybody, thank you so much for that.\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nYou know what Joseph Campbell said about religion, Jeff?\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nDon't fart on it?\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nTo paraphrase Joseph Campbell, people fuck it up because they think the Bibles are newspapers.\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000\nYour religion is supposed to have a transparency to it.\n\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000\nYou're supposed to be in on the joke.\n\n01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000\nYou're supposed to have one foot in, one foot out.\n\n01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nThe whole point of religion, the whole point of God is that the jar that God comes in says on the label,\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nyou're not supposed to understand it.\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000\nIt's not fucking steak sauce.\n\n01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000\nYou don't get to incorporate it into your day-to-day without any degree of problems or difficulties with the people around you.\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nIt's a very personal thing.\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nSome religions make it a communal thing.\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nNotice how their communities, their kids have higher test scores and bigger pools,\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nand we get jealous of them and then we throw bricks at their windows.\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nIt's like, fucking, it's God, dude.\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nIt's like, it's confusing shit.\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nIt both exists and doesn't exist.\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000\nThat's a big confuser right there, isn't it?\n\n01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000\nThat's a tough one to handle.\n\n01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nHe's not going to come down and go like, hey, welcome to Wise Guys.\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nIs everybody doing okay?\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nThat would be the worst God ever.\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nAs soon as he does that, he's fired.\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nHe becomes Kevin Neland.\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nAs soon as he makes an appearance, that's all he is, is Kevin Neland.\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nHe retains God status by staying out of the picture.\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nThere are less images of Jesus in a church than there are of Kevin Neland in this comedy clip.\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000\nJesus is good with just that one, like, hey, did a thing.\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000\nAnd our parents fuck us up.\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nIt's a popular 25.\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nWhen you're 25, you go like, well, I don't, but you smoke a joint and you go like,\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nah, man, you know, God, just fucking bullshit.\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nI don't believe in some guy in a cloud with a beard.\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000\nYou know, I'm spiritual, but I'm not religious.\n\n01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nIt's fine, it's fine.\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nJust because your parents are dipshits doesn't mean that Santa Claus and God are the same thing.\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000\nI thought it was just your parents trying to pull a whammy on you.\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nSpencer, do you believe in all the way to jaded cynicism just to get back at your parents?\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nWhat a waste of a giant brain that's designed to create and live mythology.\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nSpencer, do you have any spiritual side to you?\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nDo you believe in God?\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nWhat's your take on the whole rigmarole?\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nI was raised a Christian, and when I was young, I accepted the Lord.\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nSorry, it's a tone of voice thing.\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000\nIt wasn't a leap of faith for me.\n\n01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nIt was like, okay, there's this dude.\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nWait, if you're going to describe that moment, can we do it D&D style?\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nI guess.\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000\nSpencer, I'm being attacked by Christian parents.\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nOkay, with Bibles.\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000\nI was talking about a thing.\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nI can't switch gears that fast.\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nOh, sorry, sorry.\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nHe was going to talk about God, but he was going to explain what was going on.\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nI'm sorry, I didn't mean to...\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nWalking into the room clutching Bibles.\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nYour parents say they want to pray with you before they go out to eat.\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nSwallowing your pride, you acquiesce.\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.000\nNo, but I mean, it just, it made sense to me as a kid, and then I grew up,\n\n01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nand it made less sense to me, and I was never someone who had faith like in anything.\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nI don't have faith that my mom was going to go back, you know, come home if she left.\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000\nI didn't have faith that the bus was going to arrive.\n\n01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000\nI have faith in nothing.\n\n01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nSo when it stopped making sense, I was like, okay, this doesn't make sense.\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nI stopped taking it to be fact.\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nSo I think that there's definitely some sort of ethereal metaphysical power,\n\n01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nand it manifests itself in many ways that we don't understand.\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000\nI don't know what those are because we don't understand them.\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000\nGhosts, the Loch Ness Monster, and spontaneous combustions.\n\n01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nThose could all be the same thing, like those could be miracles,\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000\nor those could all be psychic powers.\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000\nThe Loch Ness Monster makes spontaneous combustion happen.\n\n01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nYeah, whenever you like the dreams about the sun.\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000\nNo, absolutely. I mean, when I was growing up, my parents were Christian,\n\n01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nand told me when I would break a flower pot, they'd go,\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000\nswear in the Bible that you didn't break it and all this stuff.\n\n01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nNothing will make you an atheist quicker than Christian parents.\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000\nAnd that's a proud American tradition.\n\n01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000\nBecause your parents' Christianity is like, man, it can really blow.\n\n01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nIt's like their car. You get a station wagon from them,\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000\nand you don't want either.\n\n01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000\nYour dream is to get a Camaro.\n\n01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nWhen I was a kid, I was raised in a Lutheran school as a little kid,\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000\nand you had the Sunday school and you heard the Bible stories.\n\n01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000\nThat was the only thing I kind of liked.\n\n01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000\nI never knew what they meant, but I liked the mythology of it.\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nI liked the storytelling about people blowing trumpets and knocking walls down.\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nI had no idea what the point of it all was.\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000\nBut I knew that Lutheran church, you get to sit there and doodle and nobody cares.\n\n01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nSo I just drew a lot, and I would leave the church,\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000\nand I'd go up to the pastor and he would put his hand out and he would say,\n\n01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nlet's see what you drew.\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000\nHe didn't care that I wasn't listening.\n\n01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000\nHe actually liked my little drawings.\n\n01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nI told the story before I got on the podcast where I went to Sunday school,\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000\nand my mom asked, what did you do today at Sunday school?\n\n01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000\nIt was like our first day at Sunday school,\n\n01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nand I told her and she pulled me out because it was like,\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000\nwe learned to recognize Bible characters with flashcards.\n\n01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nWe learned to recognize them visually.\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nI can tell you the difference between Ham and Noah,\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nbecause Ham had a cane in his hand.\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nNoah had a backpack.\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000\nBut confusingly, they were both cartoons.\n\n01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000\nThey both looked like Captain Caveman.\n\n01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nConfusingly, Kane had a ham in his hand.\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nAnd I explained this to my mom.\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nI said, I can tell you who Ham's wife looks like.\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nI can tell you Noah's wife looks like.\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000\nThat is ridiculous.\n\n01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nMy mom said, that is ridiculous.\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nAnd you don't have to go to Sunday school anymore.\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000\nHoly smoke.\n\n01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nBut she also put the whammy on me with the, you know,\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nGod exists and don't.\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nIf I would be programming my Commodore 64 and it wouldn't work right,\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nI would go, God damn it, fucking computer.\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nAnd my mom would go, you know, she'd slap me and go,\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000\ndon't use the Lord's name in vain.\n\n01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000\nI think she was carrying some shit over from her parents.\n\n01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nShe just knew that if she had a kid that didn't respect God,\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nshe would fuck up as a parent.\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nSo she was just out of paranoia and anxiety.\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000\nIt was like just putting the fear into me and nothing else.\n\n01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nThere was nothing.\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nAnd I remember I had these books that would be like,\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000\nlike the hand-me-downs of like, oh, see Dick and Jane hang out.\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nOh, they lost their dog.\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nOh, where's the dog?\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nWhere's Spot?\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000\nWe can't find Spot.\n\n01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nAnd I'm like, I'm learning to read.\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000\nThis is great.\n\n01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nWell, we can't find Spot.\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000\nWhat should we do?\n\n01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nTurn the page.\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nLet's pray.\n\n01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nWhat?\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nJesus can help you find your dog.\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000\nHe used to be hanging out in his robe in the middle of this book\n\n01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nabout these 50s kids looking for their dog.\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nI remember that being a drag.\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nBecause it wasn't a good story.\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000\nIt was Deus Ex Machina.\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nAnd also weird, like Jesus is not like a cool-looking character\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nin a children's book.\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000\nPardon me, Dan.\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nIt's very interesting.\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nCarlos, could I get another ale, please?\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nDid you call him Carlos?\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nThat's his name, isn't it?\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000\nIt's Marcus, isn't it?\n\n01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000\nNo, it says Marcus as he's wearing someone else's name tag.\n\n01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nWait, so your name is Carlos and you steal clothes?\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nDo you have any idea?\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nWe should point out he's definitely white.\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000\nBecause I don't want podcast listeners to hear,\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000\njust hear, oh yeah, there's a guy named Carlos\n\n01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000\nthat's wearing Marcus's clothes.\n\n01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000\nWhat happened to Marcus?\n\n01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000\nI found my name tag.\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nOh, you found it again.\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nOh, ooh, Mystery Solves.\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nThank you, Kevin Neland.\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000\nI don't know, Plot thickens.\n\n01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nAs far as I'm concerned, not Mystery Solves.\n\n01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000\nAll right, let's play Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000\nAll right, let's do it.\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nErin McGathy, will you please join us on stage?\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nAnd Carlos, once again, thank you for my beer, sir.\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nIs this legal?\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000\nCan I do this?\n\n01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000\nAll right, perfect.\n\n01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nCarlos broke the law by bringing you the beer\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000\nbecause he's not eating while he's doing it.\n\n01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000\nCarlos has to have a pretzel in his hand\n\n01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nin order to bring you the beer.\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nAll right, so Aaron,\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000\nI never know how the show's going\n\n01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nbecause I'm up here.\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000\nDid I bore people with my political and religious?\n\n01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nNo, I thought it's a great show so far.\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nThere's a lot of content.\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000\nFour Star Review from my girlfriend.\n\n01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000\nI liked a whole lot.\n\n01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000\nI love the religious talk.\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000\nMy dad was a preacher, my mom was a theology professor,\n\n01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000\nso I love that stuff.\n\n01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nIs that why I turn you on?\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000\nI mean, if you want to be gross, I think so a little bit.\n\n01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000\nI was thinking about this a few nights ago.\n\n01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000\nYou're kind of a preacher.\n\n01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nYou're a fisher of men, a little bit.\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nI have a congregation.\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nYeah, similar to my dad.\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000\nYeah.\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000\nDoes he smell like your dad?\n\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000\nNo, the dicks taste the same, but...\n\n01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000\nBread!\n\n01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nBread.\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000\nThey taste like focaccia.\n\n01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000\nShout out to my dad.\n\n01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000\nIt is delicious clerical cock.\n\n01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000\nWow.\n\n01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000\nSo awful, so awful.\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nSorry to lethah.\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000\nNo, it's nice. You spent some time with my dad.\n\n01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000\nI have a really nice, wonderful, smart, very cool dad.\n\n01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nSexy, strong, lies.\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nI went fishing with him. He's a cool dude.\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nI like him.\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nYou said he had a bunch of Mormon jokes that he used to tell,\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nand then you texted him when he chickened out,\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nand he said, I never had any Mormon jokes.\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nHe said Aaron, I was just explaining Mormon theology to you.\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nThat's why I'm here.\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nI mean, if you find that funny,\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nI am the beholder.\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000\nIt's on you.\n\n01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nBut I thought you told me a story once about when your dad was a Navy chaplain.\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000\nHe had a Scientology book in his office,\n\n01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000\nand somebody asked him what's going on,\n\n01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nand he said, I'm reading this because one of the seamen,\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000\none of my flock, is a Scientologist,\n\n01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nand he's reading all the Scientology books\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nso that he can get a better chaplain to whoever's on board his ship.\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nThat is fucking cool.\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nThat's cooler than I would be.\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nI'd be like, come on.\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nI'd read the back of the book, and I'd be like, okay.\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.000\nI really loved having T'lith up there and talking about stuff.\n\n01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000\nWe certainly didn't get to the bottom of the heavy...\n\n01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000\nThat's a whole podcast we could do.\n\n01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nAbsolutely, but I was at a box brother's,\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000\nlike a place where you mail stuff,\n\n01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000\nand I was at Santa behind a dude in Los Feliz in our neighborhood,\n\n01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000\nand he's a very well-dressed, middle-aged guy, nice suit on,\n\n01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000\nvery clearly well-to-do-ish,\n\n01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nlike life's been good to him, he's mailin' awesome stuff,\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nand he had a Scientology ring with a little S in the triangle or whatever,\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nand there were some big delays, so we're just kind of hanging out,\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nand he's kind of tapping his fingers, and I notice the ring,\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nand I go, pardon me, that ring, that's Scientology, right?\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000\nAnd he turns around, like I just tried to take his wallet from him,\n\n01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000\nand it's really defensive,\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nand this guy does not represent all Scientologists, certainly,\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000\nbut he turned around, and it's incredible,\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000\nlike almost like a posture of, like, instantly really defensive,\n\n01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000\nand I'm like, and I just kind of just pressed right past it,\n\n01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nand I go, I live in this neighborhood,\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nthere's all these Scientology buildings, I've met Scientologists,\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000\nI don't know the first thing about it,\n\n01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000\nand he's like, he's really bummed out, and he turned around,\n\n01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000\nlike, can you not tell me about it?\n\n01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000\nIs that the thing?\n\n01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nAnd I'm like, what are you doing, man, what are you doing?\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000\nAnd I'm like, I'm just asking about Scientology,\n\n01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000\nis it off limits to know?\n\n01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000\nI said, because if it is, that's fucked up.\n\n01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000\nWell, to be fair, you were wearing a Guy Fox mask.\n\n01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nHuh?\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nI said, to be fair, you were wearing a Guy Fox mask.\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nAnd later, Hosun.\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nAnd I was carrying a banjo.\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nSo, you know, he had every reason to not trust me.\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nAlso, he was buying a first aid kit,\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000\nand he was bleeding profusely from the...\n\n01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000\nRight, anyway.\n\n01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000\nIf you can't be forthright about what it is you believe,\n\n01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000\nthen I think you believe something stupid.\n\n01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000\nMaybe he had just murdered somebody\n\n01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000\nand stole the ring, I didn't know.\n\n01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000\nYeah, there should definitely be an open...\n\n01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nYeah, I think you got to open your books with the religion, for sure.\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nSecret religion? It's a little sketchy.\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nI mean, maybe some things are stupid.\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nI'll tell you what's not stupid.\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nSomething I take very seriously.\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nDungeons and Dragons.\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nWhoa!\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nSpencer, bring us up to date, please.\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nOn the last episode,\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nour heroes were still within the depths of the Infinifish.\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000\nAfter falling out of a semi-destroyed lung,\n\n01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nthe team dropped down to the circular chamber below.\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nAfter deciding to carry on,\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000\nthey ran through the next finkter into a large pink room\n\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000\nwith a large hanging organ in it.\n\n01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nAssaulting the organ with impunity,\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000\nthe gang was soon accosted by lightning spidery creatures\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000\nand fighting those and destroying the organ was the work of a moment.\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nAfter destroying the organ,\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000\nthe group stood in a chamber\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nbefore you, a tangle of fleshy quartz barring your path.\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000\nBehind you, the circular chamber you were just in.\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nGo.\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nAgain, you're...\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nI never thought I'd get the timing right on that.\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000\nThat was amazing.\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nThat's an a minute and 32-second track,\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nand you managed to go right to the last second every time.\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000\nYeah, that was orgasmic.\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000\nThat was really good.\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nI'm looking like,\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000\ncome on, a sweatshirt dripping down my head,\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000\nlike, come on, you've got four seconds.\n\n01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000\nGo.\n\n01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nWe got to clip all these up for, like, my DJ demo reel.\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000\nYeah.\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nMaybe you've heard this track enough,\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nor it's kind of cellular.\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nIt's completely random every time.\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nI play a bit to walk you on.\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nI play a bit to bring Aaron up.\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nIt's never the same thing twice.\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000\nI just marvel at your internal clock on that track.\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nIt's shocking.\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nI would say on the bus, if he ever wanted to start his own religion,\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nnow is the time.\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nIt's a great city to do it in.\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nHave you guys heard of fork knots?\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nWhat?\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nThey're little gremlins that cause all the world's problems.\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nI would like to...\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nI should have said this gigs ago,\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nbut I really need a case for a Samsung Galaxy Note 2.\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nThey break very easily,\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nbut I can't find a case for it in any truck stop or Walmart.\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nIf there was any point where I wanted anyone to think that I was a cult leader\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nthat was worth giving gifts to,\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nif you're listening and you're in Portland...\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nOr San Francisco.\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000\nWe're so far behind.\n\n01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000\nIt won't work.\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nIt won't fucking work.\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nI should have done that in Brooklyn.\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nI should have been like, I need a fucking phone case.\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nI told people I need a shoe goo,\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nand my shoe has been repaired, baby.\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nThe shoe goo did the job.\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nAlso, I never even met the person that gave the shoe goo,\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nso thank you to whoever that was.\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nAlright.\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nSo, we're in a room with a...\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nWhat's that?\n\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nThe smoke sticks.\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.000\nWe're in the lung of the Infinifish, we think,\n\n01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nand we use the smoke sticks...\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000\n...to release accurate smoke into the lungs,\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nas well as igniting torches.\n\n01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000\nRight.\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nSo we gave the Infinifish emphysema, right?\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nRight.\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nAnd then they slashed it to bits.\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nAnd then last night, we were in what we think is a kidney,\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000\nand we slashed it, and it was talking about\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000\ntrying to give the Infinifish aids and killing it that way.\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nBut we didn't know how to...\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000\nI tried to summon an aids-ridden animal,\n\n01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nbut I found out I can't summon animals.\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nI can only speak to them, so...\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000\nYeah.\n\n01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nWhat would be the noise for you\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nsummoning an aids-ridden animal?\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nHo-ho!\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nYeah, here we go.\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000\nYeah, accurate.\n\n01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nWhat do you think it's going to be?\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nAlright, so we have...\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nWell, where are we at?\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000\nThere's a thing barring our way with the fleshy cords?\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nYeah, it's like...\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nIf you imagine a large thicket of fleshy ropes.\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nIs this through the third door?\n\n01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000\nYou're in the room with the organ.\n\n01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nIf you went back a room, you'd be in that three-door room.\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nWe're, as Dolly Parton would say,\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000\nwe're two doors down.\n\n01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nTwo doors down?\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nWe've killed the lung and the kidney,\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nand we need to go back.\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nPresumably, or forward.\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nI mean, either way.\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nI say to these guys, I think we need to go back\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000\nand go through that third door and take out the third thing,\n\n01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000\nbecause this feels a lot like a video game,\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000\nor an Irish joke.\n\n01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nAlright, well, I take a swipe at the fleshy cords with my sword.\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nSeveral of them are not shatter.\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nYou know, slice into ribbons.\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000\nIt'll take a few more slices, but...\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000\nCan I just do a couple slices and slices?\n\n01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nYeah, I just start hacking at the things.\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nHacking at the things.\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nYou reveal a passageway.\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nOh, that was easy.\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nYeah, sometimes just use your machete to get through the passageway.\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nI charge headlong into the passageway.\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nNice.\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nI've changed inside this Infinifish,\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nand on this tour, and in this movie about the tour.\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nMy character's changed.\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000\nI've changed.\n\n01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nI've become cockier.\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000\nI've become...\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000\nYou rush longer-winded?\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nMore headlong, and you're rushing?\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nAlright.\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nBlasting through the opening,\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nyou are met with what appears to be a slippery slope.\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nYour momentum carries you forward,\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nand you slide down the slope.\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nI remember Aaron was in this room.\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nAt the bottom of the slope is a large,\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000\norangey-pink slime, translucent and thick.\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000\nWe're in the butt.\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000\nAnd inside the monster, you can see a large tome.\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nIt's thick and appears to be ancient,\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000\nand it's covered in splatters of blood.\n\n01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000\nInside the what?\n\n01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000\nThere's a large blob of slime,\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nas if some sort of monster,\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nbut on the inside is a large, ancient tome.\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nOkay, so that's probably one of, like,\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000\ngelatinous monster of some kind.\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000\nYeah.\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000\nYou can see blood seeping out of the book\n\n01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000\nand crawling into the mass of the slime,\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nbranching out like butts and shoots from a branch.\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nThe book calls to you.\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000\nWe should join him.\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nThe book calls to me?\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nYou sense a longing for the book.\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000\nBally high.\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nBally high.\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000\nWe are joined sharpie.\n\n01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000\nNear the blood book.\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nYou slide down the shaft in our joint with sharpie.\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000\nI do likewise.\n\n01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nThat happens also.\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nAll right, let's start simple here.\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nI'm going to use my crossbow, which I never do.\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000\nOh, it's not my thing.\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000\nI'm going to give to Mulraine,\n\n01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000\nwho I assume has better archery skills than me.\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nI'm carrying a thing called Melph's Acid Arrow.\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nThat's actually a spell.\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000\nOh, okay.\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000\nNever mind.\n\n01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nYou can cast it though.\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000\nIs that like magic missile?\n\n01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nYeah, except it does acid damage\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nand there's a chance that it will do acid damage\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000\nlater on, like damage over time.\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nI'm going to try that.\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nI'm going to try Melph's Acid Arrow.\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nIs this an organic thing?\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nMelph's Acid Arrow?\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000\nNo, not Melph.\n\n01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nMelph.\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nMelph.\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000\nIt was a guy.\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nSummoning a green bolt of noxious acid.\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nYou fire it directly at the blob.\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000\nChoctaw.\n\n01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nChoctaw.\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nDealing eight damage.\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nIt's not great, but you'll take it.\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nWhat is, ma'am?\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nI just noticed that I have a sword.\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nYeah, you have a long sword and you have weapon finesse,\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nwhich means you're actually quite adroit to it.\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nIs that the right word?\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nYes.\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nI shoot two long swords.\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nAdventure.\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nIs that a joke?\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nIt's not if you have to ask.\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nThen your bowstring would be sliced.\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nI think it's more of a bit.\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nI take the long sword and I...\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000\nUse it.\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000\nUse it.\n\n01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nI slice it towards the book.\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nYou got a critical hit.\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000\nCritical hit!\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000\nSlicing at the slime.\n\n01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nYour tree or sword leaves a clean mark along its surface.\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000\nI had someone tweet at me that I was really bad at Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nI'm not disproving him.\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000\nYou're not allowed to be sensitive about that.\n\n01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nI'm not.\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nDealing 13 damage.\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nYou notice that the slime splits in half.\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nYeah!\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nFuck you, hazmat46.\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nBoth halves launch their attacks.\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nAnd miss.\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nOh nice, we got lucky.\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nSo now there's two halves of slime?\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nTwo slimes remain.\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nEach is about half the size of the former slime that composed the two slimes.\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nThe book is on the right hand slime.\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nI don't get it.\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nSo we've passed the book on the right hand slime?\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000\nThis is making me think that I don't know what slime is.\n\n01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nBecause the way that it's acting.\n\n01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nYou don't know what swords are.\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nIt's a large blob of a goop in acid that'll kill you.\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nOkay, I go into a...\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nWhat do you call it?\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nWhat's the one?\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nI do a power attack.\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nOne, two, or three?\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000\nTwo.\n\n01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nYep.\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000\nYou miss?\n\n01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nShit.\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nOh, I'm sorry, I'm stupid.\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000\nYou hit.\n\n01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nYeah!\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000\nShit!\n\n01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nSlimes are really easy to hit.\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nAlright, it's gonna be...\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\n17 damage.\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000\n17 damage, motherfucker.\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000\nThe remaining slime that you slash splits in half, forming two smaller slimes.\n\n01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nSon of a bitch!\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nSo we're just making more slimes?\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nYeah, you are.\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000\nThey're smaller.\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nThat's true.\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000\nSharpie, this might be the wrong time to tell you, but...\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nMy thoughts exactly, friends.\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nOh, that wasn't...\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nNo, I'm sorry.\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nNo, I agree.\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nYou spoke my thoughts.\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nThe slimes lurch towards you and strike both Sharpie and Mulrainee with a pseudopod.\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000\nNow's a good time to check in with your boyfriend.\n\n01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000\nI'll be over here kicking ass.\n\n01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nI'm just gonna say I'm very proud of you, that's all.\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000\nShit.\n\n01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nThe two of you take 11 acid damage.\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000\nOh, man.\n\n01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000\nI see colors.\n\n01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nOh, man.\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nI could always see colors, but...\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nYeah.\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000\nI see more.\n\n01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nI see more.\n\n01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000\nI smell them.\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nCan I ask a quick sidebar, DM?\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000\nGo for it.\n\n01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000\nMending, the spell Mending.\n\n01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nCan repair a lightly damaged object.\n\n01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000\nDo you want to, like, stick this line back together?\n\n01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000\nLike, if there's a hole in a boat, that's what that's for.\n\n01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000\nOr, like, if you sat on your watch.\n\n01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nDo you know what time it is when I sit on my watch?\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nDarebox time.\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000\nTime to get a new watch, Motherfucker.\n\n01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nOh, damn.\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nDo I gain hit points from that awesome joke?\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000\nNo.\n\n01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nAlright.\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nWhose turn is it? My turn?\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nYeah.\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nI mean, I wouldn't...\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nYes, I was thinking maybe for a second,\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nif I use Mending to mend the...\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nIf you'd like to.\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nThat might make sense.\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nIt's really easy to repair a slime.\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nYou just kind of smash it back together.\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000\nIt's a problem.\n\n01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000\nYeah, maybe counterproductive.\n\n01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nIt's like an asteroid.\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nWhy would you want to remake a big asteroid?\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nBecause it's easier to dodge a large one.\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nBut it won't...\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000\nOkay.\n\n01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nNo, I'm just fine.\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000\nI'm hearing that I should try this.\n\n01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nGo for it.\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000\nI'm going to do it.\n\n01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000\nI cast Mending on two of these smaller slimes.\n\n01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nTwo of the slimes coalesce into a larger form.\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nHowever, that final form seems to be smaller\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nthan the sum of the two slime masses.\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000\nOoh.\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000\nIt's like math.\n\n01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000\nNon-Euclidean geometry.\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000\nSpencer, may I use Alchemist's fire?\n\n01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000\nYeah.\n\n01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000\nWith the slime?\n\n01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000\nHurling a bag of Alchemist's fire\n\n01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000\nand you strike the blob directly in its center of mass.\n\n01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nDealing seven fire damage.\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000\nThe blob's now on fire.\n\n01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000\nWhich one did you do?\n\n01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000\nThe one with the book or the one without the book?\n\n01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000\nThe slime?\n\n01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000\nYeah, there's two slimes at this point.\n\n01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000\nWhich would be better?\n\n01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000\nThe one that you'd like.\n\n01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000\nI don't want to burn the book.\n\n01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000\nThat slime dies.\n\n01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000\nOnly one half slime is remaining.\n\n01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000\nThe one with the book?\n\n01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nThe one with the book.\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nFlaming sword!\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nDon't burn the book.\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000\nOh.\n\n01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nYou can extinguish the flames on your sword if you'd like.\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nI extinguish the flames on my flaming sword.\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000\nNow it's just a sword.\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nThat's a closet sword.\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nIt's a straight acting sword.\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nYeah, it's very butch.\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nYeah, it's a banner sword.\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nShirts with sleeves now.\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000\nYou slice the book slime and it splits in half,\n\n01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000\nbut it also takes 17 damage.\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000\nIt appears to be on the ropes.\n\n01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000\nHow's the book?\n\n01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000\nThe book's cool, it's fine.\n\n01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nMagic missile.\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000\nI cast magic missile at the slime so as not to hurt the book.\n\n01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000\nI'm going to resolve slime attacks first.\n\n01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nResolve them.\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.000\nQuark, you take 11 damage.\n\n01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000\nWhere's that put my hit points at?\n\n01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nYou should have been at full.\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000\nI don't think you got hit from any of the spider things.\n\n01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nI took a little bit of damage.\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000\nI think I took like 7 or something.\n\n01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000\nI think 7 from the lightning spider,\n\n01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nso 7 and 11 would put you somewhere around 22.\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000\nThis is so exciting.\n\n01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000\nIt really is.\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000\nI'm riveted.\n\n01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nSharpie takes 5 damage.\n\n01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nLightning spider!\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000\nOkay, so you were casting magic missile?\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000\nWow!\n\n01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nI'm just going to play by myself.\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000\nMagic missile.\n\n01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nHave faith that it will return to you, Spencer.\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nI think it's funny if I act like that.\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000\nIt's just a joke.\n\n01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000\nBut were you going to cast magic missile?\n\n01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nYeah, at the book wielding slime.\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000\nFiring your magic missiles, they strike true.\n\n01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nIt takes 7 damage.\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nIt's dead.\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nThe slime evaporates.\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000\nYou see the book remaining resting on the fleshy ground.\n\n01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.000\nStep back, magic expert.\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nI go to the book.\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000\nI examine it with my magical eyes.\n\n01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000\nIt appears to be written in some sort of red ink.\n\n01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000\nOr maybe blood.\n\n01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000\nIt's actually a language you don't recognize.\n\n01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000\nHowever, you still seem to feel the power and energy emanating from this book.\n\n01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000\nDoes it feel evil?\n\n01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000\nIt feels not evil, but definitely dark.\n\n01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000\nDefinitely the power of death.\n\n01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000\nI touch it.\n\n01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000\nYou touch it.\n\n01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000\nIt's a book, right?\n\n01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000\nIt feels slightly damp with blood.\n\n01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000\nAs you touch it, a bit of blood seeps out of the book onto the ground.\n\n01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000\nOpen it up and check it out, man.\n\n01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nI open up to the inside front cover.\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000\nThat's the fly leaf.\n\n01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000\nIt's covered in blood.\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000\nI open up to a random page in the middle.\n\n01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000\nIt seems to be written in red script that you don't recognize.\n\n01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nIt's definitely an old language of some sort.\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nIt's definitely not a Bissell,\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000\nor any other sort of demonic language as far as you can tell.\n\n01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000\nIs it Gnome or Dwarven?\n\n01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000\nIt is not Gnome nor...\n\n01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000\nYeah, no.\n\n01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000\nI mean...\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000\nI detect magic on it.\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nIt is intensely magical.\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000\nIntensely magic.\n\n01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nDo our little magical shards have any effect on this sort of thing?\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nI whip out a shard.\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nYou whip out a shard.\n\n01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000\nWe all whip our shards out.\n\n01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nWe compare shard length.\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000\nI only bring out enough shard to win.\n\n01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nI pull my leaf skirt down for no reason.\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000\nOkay.\n\n01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nThe shards have no reaction.\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000\nI approach the book and see if I can read it.\n\n01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000\nI cling to it tightly.\n\n01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000\nOkay.\n\n01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000\nDon't act it out then.\n\n01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.000\nDon't be snatching my book.\n\n01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nBaby, baby, baby.\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nI don't want to snatch it. I'm just trying to help.\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nLook with your eyes, not with your hands.\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000\nFine. I look with my eyes.\n\n01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000\nYou look with your eyes.\n\n01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nYou see a book. It appears ancient and old and thick and musty.\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nCan I read the language?\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000\nYou cannot read the language.\n\n01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000\nI said we take the book and find somebody who can speak this language.\n\n01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000\nWhat are the exits available to us, Spencer?\n\n01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000\nRight now, you can only see a sphincter on the floor.\n\n01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000\nPerfect spot to end, I think.\n\n01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000\nButthole cliffhanger!\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000\nLook at it, a sphincter!\n\n01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000\nThank you so much.\n\n01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000\nErin McGathy, everyone.\n\n01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000\nSwordmaster.\n\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000\nErin, are you selling merchandise out there?\n\n01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000\nOh, I'm so glad you asked.\n\n01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000\nSpencer and I will be selling merchandise downstairs.\n\n01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000\nT-shirts, one for $15, two for $25.\n\n01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000\nFree smiles, free hugs, lots of love.\n\n01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000\nStay true to yourself.\n\n01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000\nAnd depending on what time it is,\n\n01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000\nso far I have yet to be unable to stay\n\n01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000\nuntil I've signed every single thing that people buy.\n\n01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000\nSo we may break that record here because we have to leave.\n\n01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000\nI said we're getting close to wrapping this thing up here.\n\n01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000\nOh, of course. Well, that goes without saying.\n\n01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000\nI mean, I don't want to talk about politics and religion for another 40 minutes.\n\n01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000\nI just mean, I don't know what time it is.\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000\nIt feels like we did a four-hour show in a good way.\n\n01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000\nIt's 9.10.\n\n01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000\nChicken noodle deck.\n\n01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.000\nChicken noodle deck and a can for you.\n\n01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000\nThere's a sip of some hearty broth\n\n01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:01.000\nand your lips will froth at the taste of it, my friend.\n\n01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000\nChicken noodle deck.\n\n01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000\nChicken noodle deck and a...\n\n01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000\nIt's nice and thick.\n\n01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000\nLet's sing the chicken noodle dick song.\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000\nWe didn't sing it in the last night's show in...\n\n01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000\nWhere were we?

down to Harmontown.\n\n01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000\nFleeing from my Mormon faith.\n\n01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000\nIt was so constrictive I just had to escape.\n\n01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000\nIt was like Jehovah's Witness and Scientologists.\n\n01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.000\nI grew up under it and couldn't handle it.\n\n01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000\nEverything your parents tell you, you got to do the opposite.\n\n01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000\nBut every time you stand back, you might come back to it.\n\n01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.000\nBecause it really doesn't matter what you pray to.\n\n01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000\nIt's all ghosts.\n\n01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.000\nIt's just as relevant as what you put on your toast.\n\n01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000\nSome people put jam.\n\n01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000\nSome people put jelly.\n\n01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000\nI listen to Tori Amos.\n\n01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000\nSome people listen to Belly.\n\n01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000\nThey're both old bands from the 90s.\n\n01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000\nYou're all 25.\n\n01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000\nSorry that I dated myself.\n\n01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000\nTurn that brown upside down.\n\n01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000\nYou could have said R Kelly.\n\n01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000\nYou could have said R Kelly.\n\n01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000\nYou could have said Nelly.\n\n01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000\nJeff.\n\n01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000\nYo, we had a good time tonight.\n\n01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.000\nWe had a girl that was Mormon, came up on stage and her hair was ghostly white.\n\n01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000\nShe had presumably white undergarments on.\n\n01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000\nThe protector from evil.\n\n01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000\nI hope she doesn't get attacked by a bull weevil that eats up holes.\n\n01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000\nAnd lets in a pocket of sin.\n\n01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000\nI know that Mormonism and the Tabernacle is something I'd like to get in\n\n01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000\nand check it out just for a while.\n\n01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000\nI think that maybe Brigham Young could make me smile.\n\n01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000\nSpencer's coming up brown upside down.\n\n01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000\nDM.\n\n01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000\nHe is a yellow poof.\n\n01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000\nHis brown rap master.\n\n01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000\nMy name's Spencer and I'm on the mic.\n\n01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000\nI used to play volleyball so I know how to spike.\n\n01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000\nWe just came out here to Salt Lake City.\n\n01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.000\nIt's the saltiest place to suck your mama's titties.\n\n01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000\nIt's a lot of fun to be up here, I admit.\n\n01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000\nI think that you all should just submit to my will.\n\n01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nJust start all listening to me and everybody doesn't even have to be free.\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000\nYou're all my slaves.\n\n01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000\nThank you Salt Lake City.\n\n01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000\nThank you very much everybody.\n\n01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000\nMe and yellow poop is brown.\n\n01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000\nThank you dudes for coming up brown.\n\n01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000\nCraig, good luck with your job back in Wisconsin.\n\n01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000\nOr back in Los Angeles right and stuff.\n\n01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000\nTalitha, our Mormon representative.\n\n01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000\nThank you wise guys.\n\n01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000\nLet's all go out, meet downstairs, get some merchandise, have a drink and say hey.\n\n01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000\nOh, we can't have a drink.\n\n01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000\nIt's illegal here.\n\n01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000\nThank you Erin McGathy.\n\n01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000\nSpencer Crittenden.\n\n01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000\nI'm Jeff Davis.\n\n01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000\nOne more time for the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000\nDan Harmon everybody.\n\n01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000\nGod bless you.\n\n01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000\nWhatever God that may be.\n\n01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000\nI'm gonna walk around with my beer in my hand.\n\n01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000\nDon't do it Jeff, don't do it.\n\n01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:22.000\nI'm gonna walk to the green room with the beer in my hand.\n\n01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000\nThis is the sad part of the song.\n\n01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000\nHe is yellow poop is brown.\n\n01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:56.000\nCome on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:49:01.000 -->
