{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:08.740\nOh, shit! Welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California!\n\n00:17.240 --> 00:23.740\nHarmontown is now in session. Spencer Crittenden, your Dungeon Master. Spencer.\n\n00:23.740 --> 00:33.740\nAnd the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon!\n\n00:38.740 --> 00:41.740\nThank you! Thank you very much!\n\n00:42.740 --> 00:47.740\nAlright, so I threw out my back yesterday.\n\n00:47.740 --> 00:53.740\nFor real? Yeah, and it hurts a lot, and it's hard to walk.\n\n00:53.740 --> 01:05.740\nAnd today, Erin drew a bath for me, and she, it's my wife Erin, she, it wasn't Erin Sorkin.\n\n01:09.740 --> 01:11.740\nI asked him, but...\n\n01:11.740 --> 01:12.740\nThat's a better story!\n\n01:12.740 --> 01:19.740\nYeah, I mean, his take on it would be too dramatic, too clever.\n\n01:19.740 --> 01:21.740\nJust draw me a bath.\n\n01:21.740 --> 01:24.740\nWhat would an Erin Sorkin bath look like, do you think?\n\n01:24.740 --> 01:31.740\nIt would be ironic, you know, it would be like, it would have a picture of a desert above it, I don't know.\n\n01:31.740 --> 01:36.740\nIt would improvise what Erin Sorkin's style is.\n\n01:36.740 --> 01:43.740\nSo she runs me a bath, very nice of her, she puts all these Epsom salts in it, maybe this will help your bad back.\n\n01:43.740 --> 01:48.740\nAnd she's like, do you want me to put some music on? I said, yeah, just put something on.\n\n01:48.740 --> 01:56.740\nAnd she puts on, you know, probably in a genuine attempt to make me feel comfortable, not mockingly.\n\n01:56.740 --> 02:00.740\nShe puts on 90s alternative hits.\n\n02:00.740 --> 02:02.740\nIt's like a station.\n\n02:02.740 --> 02:10.740\nI'm like, oh, this doesn't make me comfortable with 90s alternative hits.\n\n02:10.740 --> 02:13.740\nIt's soothing my back and some Epsom salts.\n\n02:13.740 --> 02:15.740\nAnd then it's like a radio station.\n\n02:15.740 --> 02:23.740\nAnd then the commercial on the radio station for the 90s alternative hits is for a hospital that specializes in hip pain.\n\n02:23.740 --> 02:32.740\nAnd that's a real actual thing that happened today, just sitting there in the tub.\n\n02:32.740 --> 02:37.740\nAnd then another thing that made me feel old, but in a good way, was I watched Kung Fury.\n\n02:37.740 --> 02:39.740\nDid you see this thing, Kung Fury?\n\n02:39.740 --> 02:45.740\nThat was another woody in Toy Story moment for me.\n\n02:45.740 --> 02:52.740\nThe box opening and Kung Fury coming out and me going, oh, I'm retiring now.\n\n02:52.740 --> 02:56.740\nI guess that's very presumptuous of me to say.\n\n02:56.740 --> 02:58.740\nThere's a lot of talent and passion.\n\n02:58.740 --> 03:00.740\nYou got to check it out. It's very great.\n\n03:00.740 --> 03:04.740\nIt's like 25 minutes of just nonstop passion for the 80s.\n\n03:04.740 --> 03:11.740\nI would never have clicked on it because there's been so much hack shit that has Kung in the title.\n\n03:11.740 --> 03:15.740\nIt just sounds like something you'd probably nine times out of ten.\n\n03:15.740 --> 03:17.740\nKung Fu Panda.\n\n03:17.740 --> 03:22.740\nIt's just too much shit. Somebody sends me a video and goes, oh, you should watch this.\n\n03:22.740 --> 03:23.740\nIt's called Kung Fury.\n\n03:23.740 --> 03:26.740\nI'm not going to. I did it because of my bad back.\n\n03:26.740 --> 03:29.740\nReally, I couldn't do anything else except watch stuff.\n\n03:29.740 --> 03:33.740\nSo I clicked on it and then I was just drawn in and it's really, really good.\n\n03:33.740 --> 03:40.740\nAll you have to do is give it 30 seconds and you're either going to watch the full 25 or not, but it's really good.\n\n03:40.740 --> 03:43.740\nIt was kind of a coming of age day for that reason.\n\n03:43.740 --> 03:49.740\nBecause it's like a celebration of 80s VHS, direct-to-video kind of action films,\n\n03:49.740 --> 03:53.740\nbut simultaneously is like taking advantage of today's technology.\n\n03:53.740 --> 03:58.740\nIt was kick started by someone who appears to be probably a younger man.\n\n03:58.740 --> 04:01.740\nI've never seen him before.\n\n04:01.740 --> 04:07.740\nIt just felt the obsolescence, my obsolescence emanating off of this thing.\n\n04:07.740 --> 04:16.740\nI texted Schrab and said, man, I'm really glad this guy waited to show up until after you and I were validated.\n\n04:16.740 --> 04:22.740\nBecause if I had been in the break room at Target and seen that, I would have gotten in my car,\n\n04:22.740 --> 04:27.740\ndriven to the desert, stopped at the first cow skull,\n\n04:27.740 --> 04:30.740\nand just gotten out and just started walking.\n\n04:30.740 --> 04:39.740\nAnd I either would have faded down on me walking or I would have just dissolved like Ice Cube and Boys in the Hood.\n\n04:39.740 --> 04:42.740\nMeaning I died, I guess.\n\n04:42.740 --> 04:47.740\nIce Cube died, right? That's why he faded away.\n\n04:47.740 --> 04:50.740\nIs that Dave Kline?\n\n04:50.740 --> 04:52.740\nHey, Dave Kline, how are you?\n\n04:52.740 --> 04:54.740\nI was right. It was Dave Kline.\n\n04:54.740 --> 04:58.740\nDave Kline is sitting in the sweet spot with a camera for the home listener.\n\n04:58.740 --> 05:00.740\nOne of them pointed right at Dave Kline.\n\n05:00.740 --> 05:04.740\nThat's right. It's a Klein cam.\n\n05:04.740 --> 05:07.740\nDan, under what circumstances did you hurt your back?\n\n05:07.740 --> 05:11.740\nI think I was just like, it takes very little.\n\n05:11.740 --> 05:14.740\nI've had a bad back since I was 17.\n\n05:14.740 --> 05:18.740\nI come from a long line of bad backs and I do.\n\n05:18.740 --> 05:22.740\nEveryone in my family has a fucked up back.\n\n05:22.740 --> 05:25.740\nI'd pick it off of a list of things that could be fucked up about me.\n\n05:25.740 --> 05:28.740\nI don't want asthma. I don't want certain allergies.\n\n05:28.740 --> 05:34.740\nI'll take a bad back, but it makes it really hard to do physical labor.\n\n05:34.740 --> 05:36.740\nThat's the big downside.\n\n05:36.740 --> 05:39.740\nBoo-hoo.\n\n05:39.740 --> 05:43.740\nBut sometimes if I do too much twisting and bending,\n\n05:43.740 --> 05:47.740\nI was rearranging my office and I think I just did a certain combination of things.\n\n05:47.740 --> 05:50.740\nAnd then I tried to get on my inversion table.\n\n05:50.740 --> 05:54.740\nI have this Michael Keaton gravity boot thing that usually knocks it out.\n\n05:54.740 --> 05:57.740\nBut this time maybe I did it wrong or something.\n\n05:57.740 --> 06:00.740\nAnd then I was like, ow, ow, ow, ow.\n\n06:00.740 --> 06:03.740\nAnd I couldn't even play video games. It hurt so bad.\n\n06:03.740 --> 06:05.740\nBecause that involves sitting up.\n\n06:05.740 --> 06:06.740\nYou couldn't sit down?\n\n06:06.740 --> 06:09.740\nI can barely be standing here. I'm a hero for standing here.\n\n06:09.740 --> 06:12.740\nThank you.\n\n06:12.740 --> 06:18.740\nYeah, let's see a firefighter do this.\n\n06:18.740 --> 06:23.740\nTake some time off his jeans-stealing schedule.\n\n06:23.740 --> 06:27.740\nThese guys can't stop stealing jeans.\n\n06:27.740 --> 06:29.740\nThat's why they become firefighters.\n\n06:29.740 --> 06:32.740\nThey're like, mmm, free jeans.\n\n06:32.740 --> 06:37.740\nIf you're a firefighter and this is your first episode, it's a callback.\n\n06:37.740 --> 06:42.740\nI don't believe you stole jeans during 9-11.\n\n06:42.740 --> 06:44.740\nI know that's an urban myth.\n\n06:44.740 --> 06:47.740\nIt's an urban myth that entertains me.\n\n06:47.740 --> 06:49.740\nI'm calling back to the joke.\n\n06:49.740 --> 06:55.740\nThere's also an urban myth that firefighters come to our podcast.\n\n06:55.740 --> 07:02.740\nOr they're out there watching on their little fireproof laptops.\n\n07:02.740 --> 07:08.740\nHave you seen the Little Caesar commercial where the...\n\n07:08.740 --> 07:11.740\nLittle Caesars has this ad for this guy.\n\n07:11.740 --> 07:13.740\nThis is related to laptops.\n\n07:13.740 --> 07:16.740\nLittle Caesars has this guy because Little Caesars is doing this campaign\n\n07:16.740 --> 07:26.740\nto try to convince you that ordering their pizza is easier than ordering online.\n\n07:26.740 --> 07:28.740\nThey're doing these commercials where it's like,\n\n07:28.740 --> 07:30.740\nyeah, man, this is so much easier.\n\n07:30.740 --> 07:35.740\nThey're vilifying the process of ordering pizza online.\n\n07:35.740 --> 07:38.740\nI don't know how they think that that's going to...\n\n07:38.740 --> 07:41.740\nOne of the commercials I saw today, because I have a bad back,\n\n07:41.740 --> 07:45.740\nI was just watching Key and Peele all day and watching these shitty commercials.\n\n07:45.740 --> 07:49.740\nThere's a guy who goes like, hey, can I get two pizzas?\n\n07:49.740 --> 07:51.740\nAnd his hands are below the counter.\n\n07:51.740 --> 07:54.740\nAnd she goes, yeah, that'll be whatever, a fucking 99 or whatever.\n\n07:54.740 --> 07:59.740\nAnd he goes, thanks, you have no idea how much easier it is than ordering online.\n\n07:59.740 --> 08:01.740\nAnd he lifts his hands...\n\n08:01.740 --> 08:03.740\nSo he's lifting his hands.\n\n08:03.740 --> 08:13.740\nBoth of his hands have been thrust through the backside of computer monitors on laptops.\n\n08:13.740 --> 08:18.740\nBecause it wouldn't read otherwise as a laptop.\n\n08:18.740 --> 08:22.740\nThe idea is he's been so frustrated with his computers\n\n08:22.740 --> 08:26.740\nand such a pussy that he had to sneak up on them.\n\n08:26.740 --> 08:28.740\nI was like, I'll be right back.\n\n08:28.740 --> 08:33.740\nNo, it's because obviously they're in the production meeting and they're like,\n\n08:33.740 --> 08:39.740\noh, but all laptops just look like slabs of nothingness from behind.\n\n08:39.740 --> 08:43.740\nOh, well, we'll just turn around. Julie, can we just turn around?\n\n08:43.740 --> 08:47.740\nYeah, yeah, just give me a second, we'll turn around.\n\n08:47.740 --> 08:51.740\nNobody was like, the actor's like, I don't fucking care, I'm on a pizza commercial.\n\n08:51.740 --> 08:55.740\nI already want to kill myself.\n\n08:55.740 --> 08:57.740\nI'm not going to argue with these people.\n\n08:57.740 --> 08:59.740\nI'm not going to be the actor that had to do a pizza commercial\n\n08:59.740 --> 09:02.740\nand was high maintenance about it.\n\n09:02.740 --> 09:05.740\nI'm just going to do this and get out of here.\n\n09:05.740 --> 09:10.740\nThe idea being that he tried to order online and his hands went through a computer?\n\n09:10.740 --> 09:16.740\nWell, because I'm assuming the idea is that he was trying to order a pizza online and couldn't.\n\n09:16.740 --> 09:20.740\nAnd then he told his computer to turn around.\n\n09:20.740 --> 09:23.740\nLook over there.\n\n09:23.740 --> 09:26.740\nI mean, the idea is that he would have punched in frustration,\n\n09:26.740 --> 09:30.740\nbut it looks like his computer was so ashamed that it couldn't order pizza for him\n\n09:30.740 --> 09:34.740\nthat it went down to the river like Lenny of Mice and Men.\n\n09:34.740 --> 09:41.740\nAnd he sympathetically, euthanistically dispatched it.\n\n09:41.740 --> 09:46.740\nAnd he's just saying to the lady, it's much easier to go through little Caesars.\n\n09:46.740 --> 09:51.740\nAnd then during Key and Peel, which is awesome, I saw a bunch of Key and Speel,\n\n09:51.740 --> 09:55.740\nburied sketches that I have.\n\n09:55.740 --> 09:58.740\nIt's nice when you go through a spate of not watching Key and Peel,\n\n09:58.740 --> 10:00.740\nyou get to catch up with a lot of...\n\n10:00.740 --> 10:02.740\nThese guys really go for it.\n\n10:02.740 --> 10:05.740\nWe should have watered both of them on the show, he said.\n\n10:05.740 --> 10:08.740\nHe said flagrently.\n\n10:08.740 --> 10:10.740\nYup, we got a yup.\n\n10:10.740 --> 10:12.740\nDo we have a yup?\n\n10:12.740 --> 10:15.740\nThe yups have it.\n\n10:15.740 --> 10:20.740\nYeah, but it probably has to be one of them, they hate each other.\n\n10:20.740 --> 10:21.740\nThey won't work together.\n\n10:21.740 --> 10:22.740\nNo, that's kid in play.\n\n10:22.740 --> 10:24.740\nOh, that's right, that's right.\n\n10:24.740 --> 10:27.740\nWow.\n\n10:27.740 --> 10:32.740\nNo, but they did voices.\n\n10:32.740 --> 10:33.740\nWas he right?\n\n10:33.740 --> 10:35.740\nDid you confuse kid in play?\n\n10:35.740 --> 10:41.740\nNo, you just confused my joke for realsies.\n\n10:41.740 --> 10:46.740\nYou're seeing double and one thing is the joke and for realsies are separate\n\n10:46.740 --> 10:50.740\nbecause you're seeing double, so you're looking at the for realsies.\n\n10:50.740 --> 10:56.740\nFocus on the joke half of your vision.\n\n10:56.740 --> 11:02.740\nThey did voices for Rick and Morty, which I...\n\n11:02.740 --> 11:09.740\nAdult Swim didn't want us to talk about all the guest voices,\n\n11:09.740 --> 11:13.740\nbut like 20% of our second season is leaked online,\n\n11:13.740 --> 11:16.740\nso you already know that they did voices.\n\n11:16.740 --> 11:18.740\nUnless you're one of these wonderful people who...\n\n11:18.740 --> 11:19.740\nAnd I don't even...\n\n11:19.740 --> 11:21.740\nI mean, I appreciate the sacrifice.\n\n11:21.740 --> 11:23.740\nI think people are tweeting me going,\n\n11:23.740 --> 11:27.740\nthe two episodes that we sent out to press are leaked of Rick and Morty,\n\n11:27.740 --> 11:31.740\nand I'm not going to watch them until the date.\n\n11:31.740 --> 11:32.740\nI'd be with you, I think.\n\n11:32.740 --> 11:34.740\nI mean, I also don't...\n\n11:34.740 --> 11:36.740\nI don't fault anybody for doing it,\n\n11:36.740 --> 11:39.740\nbut I don't care about the politics of it.\n\n11:39.740 --> 11:42.740\nI would just say from On Justin's behalf\n\n11:42.740 --> 11:46.740\nthat we'd rather be finished with the episodes when you watch them\n\n11:46.740 --> 11:49.740\nand we'd rather you see them with the sound mixed and stuff like that.\n\n11:49.740 --> 11:50.740\nWe're doing it for Justin.\n\n11:50.740 --> 11:53.740\nAll right, good.\n\n11:53.740 --> 11:56.740\nHashtag.\n\n11:56.740 --> 12:00.740\nAnd there was another commercial during the Key and Peels.\n\n12:00.740 --> 12:03.740\nSo, okay, so, all right, so I'm 42.\n\n12:03.740 --> 12:06.740\nSo a lot of this show is about me being open and honest\n\n12:06.740 --> 12:09.740\nabout my racially obsessed 70s upbringing,\n\n12:09.740 --> 12:11.740\nthe brain that's resulted in like,\n\n12:11.740 --> 12:16.740\nI'm struggling with a post-racial, a millennial generation,\n\n12:16.740 --> 12:17.740\nand I'm not...\n\n12:17.740 --> 12:20.740\nI think the second half of a proper life should be spent\n\n12:20.740 --> 12:23.740\nrealizing how wrong you were for the first half,\n\n12:23.740 --> 12:24.740\nand I'm loving it.\n\n12:24.740 --> 12:26.740\nThat's what this show is about to a large degree.\n\n12:26.740 --> 12:27.740\nI'm going to therapy now.\n\n12:27.740 --> 12:29.740\nYou heard me swear off therapy,\n\n12:29.740 --> 12:33.740\nand I'm never going to like giraffes, but like...\n\n12:33.740 --> 12:37.740\nBut so I'm confused about this one.\n\n12:37.740 --> 12:39.740\nSo I'm watching Key and Peel,\n\n12:39.740 --> 12:42.740\nand then this McDonald's commercial comes on.\n\n12:42.740 --> 12:44.740\nI thought we stopped doing this.\n\n12:44.740 --> 12:47.740\nI thought this was like an 80s, 90s thing,\n\n12:47.740 --> 12:49.740\nand then we got embarrassed about it,\n\n12:49.740 --> 12:52.740\nthe transparency of it, and stopped doing it.\n\n12:52.740 --> 12:54.740\nMaybe this is post now.\n\n12:54.740 --> 12:56.740\nNow it's like, well, why not do it?\n\n12:56.740 --> 12:59.740\nIt's just like we're still doing the wrapping\n\n12:59.740 --> 13:01.740\nall Black people McDonald's commercials,\n\n13:01.740 --> 13:04.740\nthe separate but equal McDonald's commercials\n\n13:04.740 --> 13:07.740\nwhere it's just all Black people,\n\n13:07.740 --> 13:09.740\nand the announcer's Black, and everyone's Black,\n\n13:09.740 --> 13:11.740\nand everyone's unified by Blackness,\n\n13:11.740 --> 13:12.740\nand loving McDonald's,\n\n13:12.740 --> 13:15.740\nand I can't figure out how I feel about it anymore,\n\n13:15.740 --> 13:17.740\nbecause we used to unilaterally go,\n\n13:17.740 --> 13:19.740\nwell, this is ridiculous.\n\n13:19.740 --> 13:21.740\nThis is a holdover from a time when we thought\n\n13:21.740 --> 13:24.740\nthat race separated people,\n\n13:24.740 --> 13:26.740\nand that advertisers were catering to it,\n\n13:26.740 --> 13:29.740\nand now I have no idea how to feel about it,\n\n13:29.740 --> 13:31.740\nbecause they're clearly young and beautiful,\n\n13:31.740 --> 13:33.740\nand if I was part of a stereotype\n\n13:33.740 --> 13:36.740\nthat made me look sexy\n\n13:36.740 --> 13:39.740\nand have a good time all the time\n\n13:39.740 --> 13:40.740\nwhen I was eating my cheeseburgers,\n\n13:40.740 --> 13:42.740\nand I saw the commercial, I might go like,\n\n13:42.740 --> 13:43.740\nwell, now I want a cheeseburger,\n\n13:43.740 --> 13:45.740\nnow that you're telling me white people\n\n13:45.740 --> 13:46.740\ndo their white thing,\n\n13:46.740 --> 13:48.740\nand part of being white is looking good,\n\n13:48.740 --> 13:51.740\nand jamming out, and like,\n\n13:51.740 --> 13:53.740\nit's just like, it comes out, it's like,\n\n13:53.740 --> 13:55.740\n250 for a burger and fry,\n\n13:55.740 --> 13:56.740\ndouble, double, double, fry, fry,\n\n13:56.740 --> 13:58.740\ndouble, double, fry,\n\n13:58.740 --> 14:01.740\nand it makes no bones about it,\n\n14:01.740 --> 14:03.740\nit's not disguising it anymore,\n\n14:03.740 --> 14:05.740\nit's back to the 80s, like 80s was like that,\n\n14:05.740 --> 14:07.740\nit was like they would just have a commercial,\n\n14:07.740 --> 14:09.740\nit was just like, it was just fucking like crazy,\n\n14:09.740 --> 14:12.740\nit was like, yo, you want to get a burger,\n\n14:12.740 --> 14:14.740\nget a whopper, a whopper, please,\n\n14:14.740 --> 14:17.740\nI want a whopper, whopper with all my cheese.\n\n14:17.740 --> 14:22.740\nAnd it was just black people just biting into burgers,\n\n14:22.740 --> 14:23.740\nand they're just like, huh,\n\n14:23.740 --> 14:24.740\nand it's just like there's an elephant in the room,\n\n14:24.740 --> 14:27.740\nit's just like, hey, your race is different,\n\n14:27.740 --> 14:29.740\nbut you should buy our product anyway,\n\n14:29.740 --> 14:31.740\nand so then I think in the 90s\n\n14:31.740 --> 14:34.740\nit got a little more subtle, maybe?\n\n14:34.740 --> 14:38.740\nSomeone told me about, have you seen this commercial?\n\n14:38.740 --> 14:40.740\nI think we must have talked about this commercial\n\n14:40.740 --> 14:42.740\non this podcast, the Coors,\n\n14:42.740 --> 14:44.740\nI think it's a Coors-like commercial,\n\n14:44.740 --> 14:46.740\nthe Silver Bullet people, right?\n\n14:46.740 --> 14:48.740\nSo there's this commercial,\n\n14:48.740 --> 14:50.740\nwe had to have talked about this,\n\n14:50.740 --> 14:52.740\nthe commercial opens up,\n\n14:52.740 --> 14:55.740\nthis is the 21st century that this commercial is,\n\n14:55.740 --> 14:57.740\nthere's like courthouse steps,\n\n14:57.740 --> 14:59.740\nthey're just like a skyscraper steps,\n\n14:59.740 --> 15:04.740\nand a multi-ethnic group of young executives comes out,\n\n15:04.740 --> 15:06.740\nand they're like, they just finished work\n\n15:06.740 --> 15:09.740\nin one suit, and they're like kind of congratulating each other\n\n15:09.740 --> 15:13.740\non a job well done for capitalism that day,\n\n15:13.740 --> 15:16.740\nand the Asian lady walks off,\n\n15:16.740 --> 15:19.740\nand the white guy goes his way,\n\n15:19.740 --> 15:21.740\nand there's probably a Latino guy\n\n15:21.740 --> 15:23.740\nalthough we're lagging there,\n\n15:23.740 --> 15:29.740\nbut at any rate, we follow the handsome young black executive,\n\n15:29.740 --> 15:32.740\nand he goes, and then it goes to a special train station\n\n15:32.740 --> 15:34.740\nthat he goes to,\n\n15:34.740 --> 15:38.740\nand I think it's all black people on the train platform,\n\n15:38.740 --> 15:41.740\nand then the Coors-like Silver Bullet train pulls up,\n\n15:41.740 --> 15:45.740\nand it opens up, and inside is a crazy black party\n\n15:45.740 --> 15:48.740\non like a Buck Rogers set,\n\n15:48.740 --> 15:51.740\nthat's like with dry ice and like holograms,\n\n15:51.740 --> 15:53.740\nand just all black people just grooving out,\n\n15:53.740 --> 15:55.740\ndrinking Coors-like, and he gets in it,\n\n15:55.740 --> 15:57.740\nand it just goes away, and it's like,\n\n15:57.740 --> 16:00.740\nhey, you're black, you have a secret life,\n\n16:00.740 --> 16:02.740\nmake our beverage a part of it,\n\n16:02.740 --> 16:06.740\nlike why not?\n\n16:06.740 --> 16:10.740\nHow do we...\n\n16:10.740 --> 16:12.740\nHow do we feel about this?\n\n16:12.740 --> 16:14.740\nI mean, I guess it's not how do we feel about it,\n\n16:14.740 --> 16:16.740\nit's how does the average...\n\n16:16.740 --> 16:18.740\nThe sales of the commercial is targeted strictly at an audience,\n\n16:18.740 --> 16:20.740\nit goes like, yeah, you're a black guy,\n\n16:20.740 --> 16:22.740\nit's cool to be a black gal or a guy,\n\n16:22.740 --> 16:26.740\nlike, you know, cheeseburger, have a Coors-like?\n\n16:26.740 --> 16:27.740\nWe certainly don't want to live in a world\n\n16:27.740 --> 16:28.740\nwhere anything's against the law,\n\n16:28.740 --> 16:30.740\nbut we're just talking about like what's...\n\n16:30.740 --> 16:32.740\nCould there be a commercial where...\n\n16:32.740 --> 16:33.740\nWhat's respectful?\n\n16:33.740 --> 16:35.740\nThere should be a commercial where the black guy leaves,\n\n16:35.740 --> 16:37.740\nthe multi-ethnic capitalist,\n\n16:37.740 --> 16:39.740\ngoes down a secret train platform,\n\n16:39.740 --> 16:42.740\ngets on an all-black dry ice train,\n\n16:42.740 --> 16:44.740\nand then a white guy gets on the train,\n\n16:44.740 --> 16:46.740\nand everyone's like, oh, shit!\n\n16:46.740 --> 16:48.740\nEveryone stops for a second,\n\n16:48.740 --> 16:49.740\nand then he holds up a Coors-like,\n\n16:49.740 --> 16:51.740\nand they're like, yeah!\n\n16:51.740 --> 16:53.740\nYeah!\n\n16:56.740 --> 16:58.740\nExactly.\n\n16:58.740 --> 17:01.740\nI think that...\n\n17:01.740 --> 17:04.740\nWhat's the messaging there?\n\n17:06.740 --> 17:10.740\nWe know you know about the black secret lifestyle.\n\n17:10.740 --> 17:12.740\nMake this beverage part of it.\n\n17:12.740 --> 17:14.740\nYeah, their slogan is, Coors-like.\n\n17:14.740 --> 17:16.740\nIs he cool?\n\n17:21.740 --> 17:23.740\nThe funny thing is that as a TV writer,\n\n17:23.740 --> 17:27.740\nthe line doesn't seem crystal clear to me,\n\n17:27.740 --> 17:29.740\nbut it's...\n\n17:29.740 --> 17:32.740\nI'm more forgiving of that when it's not an advertising,\n\n17:32.740 --> 17:34.740\nI guess because advertising all seems toxic,\n\n17:34.740 --> 17:39.740\nso I don't blink at a black sitcom,\n\n17:39.740 --> 17:43.740\nlike the idea of a nice blue collar,\n\n17:43.740 --> 17:46.740\nlike, he's a working man, and he's got a family,\n\n17:46.740 --> 17:50.740\nand of course you don't have to diversify your all-black cast.\n\n17:50.740 --> 17:53.740\nI don't know, I just swallow that all down and go,\n\n17:53.740 --> 17:54.740\nwell, yeah, what else are we doing?\n\n17:54.740 --> 17:55.740\nWho cares? What the fuck?\n\n17:55.740 --> 17:58.740\nWe try to reflect life and try to cater to an audience.\n\n17:58.740 --> 18:00.740\nBut when McDonald's does an all-black commercial...\n\n18:00.740 --> 18:02.740\nSomehow it just makes me feel...\n\n18:02.740 --> 18:04.740\nI guess because all commercials are already,\n\n18:04.740 --> 18:07.740\neven just a regular Pringles commercial with a rainbow cast\n\n18:07.740 --> 18:10.740\nof people not popping or stopping or whatever they do,\n\n18:10.740 --> 18:12.740\nand the librarian saying...\n\n18:12.740 --> 18:15.740\nThey're popping and not stopping.\n\n18:15.740 --> 18:18.740\nNo flavor in this library!\n\n18:18.740 --> 18:22.740\nShh! What's going on?\n\n18:22.740 --> 18:27.740\nWho's having flavor in the library?\n\n18:29.740 --> 18:33.740\nTitties. Glasses off, titties.\n\n18:33.740 --> 18:36.740\nBecause fuck women, fuck them.\n\n18:39.740 --> 18:42.740\nI am so offended by the racial non-homogeneity\n\n18:42.740 --> 18:46.740\nin commercials, but hey, if you want to sell me a beer,\n\n18:46.740 --> 18:49.740\nput it right between a pair of tits of any color, really,\n\n18:49.740 --> 18:52.740\nbecause I don't see things through that lens.\n\n18:55.740 --> 18:59.740\nI'll look at a big, round pair of fake titties of any color.\n\n18:59.740 --> 19:02.740\nI'm progressive.\n\n19:06.740 --> 19:08.740\nWhat is going on?\n\n19:08.740 --> 19:10.740\nGo on.\n\n19:10.740 --> 19:12.740\nWhat?\n\n19:14.740 --> 19:16.740\nI don't know.\n\n19:18.740 --> 19:21.740\nWhen you see an all-black McDonald's commercial,\n\n19:21.740 --> 19:25.740\nwhat is your instinct, what is your reaction to that?\n\n19:25.740 --> 19:28.740\nI go, Jesus, that's embarrassing and awkward, that's fucked up.\n\n19:28.740 --> 19:31.740\nDo you think a black person thinks that's embarrassing\n\n19:31.740 --> 19:33.740\nthat they're being pandered to?\n\n19:33.740 --> 19:35.740\nI don't know, and I'll tell you what we're not going to do.\n\n19:35.740 --> 19:37.740\nWe're not going to ask if there's a black person in the audience\n\n19:37.740 --> 19:39.740\nand then bring them up and have them speak for all black people.\n\n19:39.740 --> 19:43.740\nBecause I just don't want to do that to that person.\n\n19:47.740 --> 19:50.740\nThat person has a right to feel however they feel.\n\n19:50.740 --> 19:52.740\nI'm talking about you.\n\n19:52.740 --> 19:56.740\nI look at it and I go, we talked about this last week\n\n19:56.740 --> 20:00.740\nabout how I confessed about my weird white perspective\n\n20:00.740 --> 20:05.740\non these issues that doesn't quite matter and yet matters a lot,\n\n20:05.740 --> 20:08.740\nshould be reflected upon.\n\n20:08.740 --> 20:10.740\nThat's how my feelings matter.\n\n20:10.740 --> 20:12.740\nIt should be me looking at myself and going,\n\n20:12.740 --> 20:14.740\nwhy does this make you feel this way?\n\n20:17.740 --> 20:19.740\nThe complicated thing is that all of my feelings\n\n20:19.740 --> 20:21.740\nhave to do with perception of the other.\n\n20:21.740 --> 20:24.740\nWhen I see the commercial come on, I immediately go,\n\n20:24.740 --> 20:27.740\nI think my first emotional impulse is,\n\n20:27.740 --> 20:31.740\nif I were black, this would make me feel angry.\n\n20:31.740 --> 20:33.740\nThis would outrage me, yes.\n\n20:33.740 --> 20:36.740\nIt would make me hate society, yes.\n\n20:36.740 --> 20:38.740\nBecause I would be going, what do all these people have in common\n\n20:38.740 --> 20:41.740\nand why is this corporation telling me,\n\n20:41.740 --> 20:44.740\nwhy is this a hook?\n\n20:44.740 --> 20:46.740\nWhy are they considering my race to be?\n\n20:46.740 --> 20:51.740\nAnd then simultaneously also saying that my race is necessarily,\n\n20:51.740 --> 20:54.740\nof course it's fucking hip hop music.\n\n20:54.740 --> 20:56.740\nOf course it's, in the announcer,\n\n20:56.740 --> 20:59.740\nhe's not an uptight black guy.\n\n20:59.740 --> 21:03.740\nThey exist, but it's like the voiceover role is like,\n\n21:03.740 --> 21:06.740\nI don't know, the fucking voiceover guy in the McDonald's commercial is like,\n\n21:06.740 --> 21:08.740\nhey, you know what time it is.\n\n21:08.740 --> 21:14.740\nIt's like, it's always get that oozing with fucking nighttime DJ sexuality.\n\n21:14.740 --> 21:17.740\nI don't know, on one hand it would be like,\n\n21:17.740 --> 21:19.740\nMaybe the commercial is not targeted towards black people,\n\n21:19.740 --> 21:21.740\nbut to white people, like, oh shit.\n\n21:21.740 --> 21:23.740\nThat's actually a really good point,\n\n21:23.740 --> 21:25.740\nbecause they're all very attractive black people.\n\n21:25.740 --> 21:27.740\nMaybe the white person that's behind you is like, fuck society,\n\n21:27.740 --> 21:29.740\nI'm gonna do it, black people too.\n\n21:29.740 --> 21:33.740\nI'm so angry at white corporate America,\n\n21:33.740 --> 21:35.740\nI'm gonna go eat a fucking Big Mac\n\n21:35.740 --> 21:39.740\nwith my thin little white lips, nibble nibble nibble nibble nibble.\n\n21:41.740 --> 21:43.740\nLook at me, Ray Kroc.\n\n21:47.740 --> 21:50.740\nAre you angry at White House?\n\n21:50.740 --> 21:52.740\nMmm, chicken McNuggets.\n\n21:52.740 --> 21:57.740\nAnyways.\n\n21:57.740 --> 21:59.740\nBut there is another part of me that I said,\n\n21:59.740 --> 22:02.740\nlike I said, because it's not like,\n\n22:02.740 --> 22:05.740\nit's not negative stereotypes in the commercial,\n\n22:05.740 --> 22:09.740\nit's you're fun, you're sexy, you're having a good time.\n\n22:09.740 --> 22:10.740\nI don't know, it's weird.\n\n22:10.740 --> 22:12.740\nI don't think anyone likes being defined.\n\n22:12.740 --> 22:14.740\nI think if they had a commercial that said,\n\n22:14.740 --> 22:17.740\nlike, hey, you're blonde, come to McDonald's,\n\n22:17.740 --> 22:19.740\nlike, blondes have a good time,\n\n22:19.740 --> 22:22.740\nlike, you know how blondes are.\n\n22:22.740 --> 22:23.740\nAfter work with my blonde friends,\n\n22:23.740 --> 22:27.740\nI'm in the mood for one thing, chicken McNuggets.\n\n22:27.740 --> 22:30.740\nBut so many commercials are all white people.\n\n22:30.740 --> 22:33.740\nYou don't feel that that's insulting to white people?\n\n22:33.740 --> 22:36.740\nIt's unanimously white people in a commercial?\n\n22:36.740 --> 22:38.740\nI don't think you can insult white people.\n\n22:40.740 --> 22:43.740\nI don't know how to do that, except to call them racists.\n\n22:45.740 --> 22:48.740\nMario at the drying room, I'm giving him credit for that joke.\n\n22:48.740 --> 22:51.740\nHe said, because we were talking about race,\n\n22:51.740 --> 22:53.740\nbecause I was in there.\n\n22:54.740 --> 22:56.740\nAnd Mario, if you ever go to the drying room,\n\n22:56.740 --> 22:58.740\nis that big guy Mario behind the bar.\n\n22:58.740 --> 22:59.740\nHe's Cuban, yeah.\n\n22:59.740 --> 23:01.740\nAnd he goes, you know what they say about white people, Dan?\n\n23:01.740 --> 23:05.740\nI said, no, he's like, you can call them honky, cracker,\n\n23:05.740 --> 23:08.740\npeckerwood, just don't call them racist.\n\n23:09.740 --> 23:12.740\nI was like, you're right, that's the only thing that offensive.\n\n23:12.740 --> 23:14.740\nThey get all Brent out of shape.\n\n23:14.740 --> 23:18.740\nI'd love to be called peckerwood, that would be amazing.\n\n23:19.740 --> 23:21.740\nIt would make me feel struggle.\n\n23:22.740 --> 23:24.740\nYeah, I am a peckerwood.\n\n23:26.740 --> 23:28.740\nAre you afraid?\n\n23:32.740 --> 23:34.740\nOf my wooden pecker?\n\n23:36.740 --> 23:37.740\nYou should be.\n\n23:37.740 --> 23:44.740\nI will mortgage your house and then lie about it,\n\n23:44.740 --> 23:49.740\nand foreclose, because I am manipulative and racist,\n\n23:49.740 --> 23:51.740\nand I'm a peckerwood.\n\n23:52.740 --> 23:53.740\nCareful.\n\n23:53.740 --> 24:02.740\nWhat's the McDonald's commercial targeted just towards peckerwood?\n\n24:09.740 --> 24:13.740\nThat knife holds hard because it curves to the left.\n\n24:17.740 --> 24:20.740\nSo you pick your three wood and you hold your breath\n\n24:20.740 --> 24:24.740\nand you swing for the clouds, but you know that your stomach is empty.\n\n24:31.740 --> 24:34.740\nI can't believe they got Bob Seeger to that commercial.\n\n24:37.740 --> 24:41.740\nHey, tomorrow's Wednesday, and as all white people know,\n\n24:41.740 --> 24:43.740\nit's secret, no work day.\n\n24:43.740 --> 24:48.740\nSo come to McDonald's, there won't be any black people there.\n\n24:51.740 --> 24:54.740\nAnd that commercial, what if one black guy walks in on that day?\n\n24:54.740 --> 24:56.740\nAnd then he holds up with McNugget and we're like,\n\n24:56.740 --> 24:57.740\nGet in here!\n\n24:57.740 --> 25:10.740\nAll right, so speaking of outrage,\n\n25:10.740 --> 25:17.740\nso I'm playing Arkham Knight on the Xbox,\n\n25:17.740 --> 25:22.740\nand after that, so I've played all three of the Arkham games\n\n25:22.740 --> 25:26.740\nand then realizing like, holy shit, Alfred as always is helping a lot.\n\n25:26.740 --> 25:28.740\nHe helps a lot, Alfred.\n\n25:28.740 --> 25:30.740\nLike, he's the point man.\n\n25:30.740 --> 25:31.740\nHe's like, you know, he's like,\n\n25:31.740 --> 25:33.740\nSo you should know that those fingerprints belong to the so-and-so.\n\n25:33.740 --> 25:37.740\nLike, he's working a full-time job, like running prints\n\n25:37.740 --> 25:39.740\nand going through crime databases and stuff.\n\n25:39.740 --> 25:42.740\nAnd it's just like, and he does that in the movies too,\n\n25:42.740 --> 25:43.740\nso it's not just the video game,\n\n25:43.740 --> 25:45.740\nbut it's like, it finally just occurred to me\n\n25:45.740 --> 25:47.740\nbecause I was playing Batman and once again Alfred is like,\n\n25:47.740 --> 25:49.740\nShould I send the new Batsuit, sir?\n\n25:49.740 --> 25:50.740\nLike, thank you.\n\n25:50.740 --> 25:53.740\nAnd he's like, you'll notice the Kevlar plating is a little bit of a tweak.\n\n25:53.740 --> 25:55.740\nAnd I'm like, yeah, thanks.\n\n25:55.740 --> 25:58.740\nAnd then I'm like, okay, will there be anything else, sir?\n\n25:58.740 --> 26:01.740\nAnd then I was like, yeah, oh, well, the sink is filling with dishes.\n\n26:01.740 --> 26:07.740\nLike, you're, you are a fucking butler.\n\n26:07.740 --> 26:11.740\nWe can't hire anymore help because every time you touch a goddamn Shakespeare head,\n\n26:11.740 --> 26:18.740\nthe fucking bookcase turns into a scuba vehicle.\n\n26:18.740 --> 26:21.740\nSo we can't, I guess at me and this 900 room house with one guy,\n\n26:21.740 --> 26:25.740\nI just think like Alfred like must be pretty pissed off.\n\n26:25.740 --> 26:27.740\nLike talk about a guy with, you know,\n\n26:27.740 --> 26:32.740\nthat like you must spend his nights like punching walls because,\n\n26:32.740 --> 26:34.740\nbecause Batman comes home and goes like, thank you.\n\n26:34.740 --> 26:38.740\nAnd then Alfred's like, okay, well, he probably every night goes like,\n\n26:38.740 --> 26:41.740\nlike sends these big hints like, well, if there's nothing else,\n\n26:41.740 --> 26:44.740\nthen I guess I should, you know, while this was all going on,\n\n26:44.740 --> 26:47.740\nwhile I was coming up with that antidote for the neurotoxin,\n\n26:47.740 --> 26:50.740\nI did like, I forgot to sweep up the pantry.\n\n26:50.740 --> 26:52.740\nSo I guess I'll go do that.\n\n26:52.740 --> 27:00.740\nAnd then Bruce Wayne's like, okay, cool.\n\n27:00.740 --> 27:01.740\nHe's his butler for real.\n\n27:01.740 --> 27:03.740\nIt's not like a fake like thing.\n\n27:03.740 --> 27:06.740\nLike, like he's, his boss is a guy who pretends to be a bat,\n\n27:06.740 --> 27:10.740\nbut he can't, he can't even be a fake butler.\n\n27:10.740 --> 27:11.740\nHe's not even allowed.\n\n27:11.740 --> 27:13.740\nSo do you think maybe I could have an alter ego?\n\n27:13.740 --> 27:16.740\nMaybe by day, I'm not a fucking butler.\n\n27:16.740 --> 27:17.740\nIt's crazy.\n\n27:17.740 --> 27:21.740\nWhite people have it hard.\n\n27:21.740 --> 27:24.740\nNot on Wednesday.\n\n27:24.740 --> 27:29.740\nYou've been polishing Bruce Wayne's candelabra\n\n27:29.740 --> 27:31.740\nand helping him fight poison ivy,\n\n27:31.740 --> 27:34.740\nbut your lips are smacking for that salty taste\n\n27:34.740 --> 27:43.740\nof a deep fried string of processed potato-like substance.\n\n27:43.740 --> 27:47.740\nAll right, well, is it, hey, is, is, is Curtis here yet?\n\n27:47.740 --> 27:48.740\nNo.\n\n27:48.740 --> 27:50.740\nOkay, the fucking guy telling you.\n\n27:50.740 --> 27:51.740\nStay nice.\n\n27:51.740 --> 27:53.740\nStayin' fucking nice.\n\n27:53.740 --> 27:55.740\nYou know we have no show other than that.\n\n27:55.740 --> 27:56.740\nSpencer, how's it going?\n\n27:56.740 --> 27:59.740\nHey guys, I'm, I'm doing just good.\n\n27:59.740 --> 28:04.740\nLet's, uh, oh, so someone, I'd assume a fan of Harmontown\n\n28:04.740 --> 28:07.740\nsent me a Super Nintendo game, I think,\n\n28:07.740 --> 28:09.740\nanonymously, it was Mega Man X3.\n\n28:09.740 --> 28:12.740\nIt's worth, like, a lot of money.\n\n28:12.740 --> 28:15.740\nSo, I should've mentioned it weeks and weeks ago,\n\n28:15.740 --> 28:17.740\nbut thank you very much.\n\n28:17.740 --> 28:19.740\nSorry, sorry everybody.\n\n28:19.740 --> 28:20.740\nNow, now to today.\n\n28:20.740 --> 28:23.740\nI was driving by a place called Kabob Time,\n\n28:23.740 --> 28:27.740\nand it's all, I guess already you know the marketing's not\n\n28:27.740 --> 28:29.740\nvery strong at this location,\n\n28:29.740 --> 28:33.740\nbut Kabob Time had assigned a subtitle, if you will,\n\n28:33.740 --> 28:36.740\nfor the restaurant, which I don't know if that's common.\n\n28:36.740 --> 28:38.740\nI guess that's kind of common for restaurants,\n\n28:38.740 --> 28:42.740\nbut he said, no heartburn, exclamation point,\n\n28:42.740 --> 28:46.740\nwhich is very interesting tactic for advertising.\n\n28:46.740 --> 28:48.740\nIt's like you don't see that elsewhere,\n\n28:48.740 --> 28:52.740\nlike Denny's not poison, or like...\n\n28:52.740 --> 28:53.740\nIt's also totally irresponsible.\n\n28:53.740 --> 28:54.740\nThey can't say that.\n\n28:54.740 --> 28:57.740\nYeah, that's completely down to your own constitution.\n\n28:57.740 --> 28:58.740\nLike...\n\n28:58.740 --> 28:59.740\nThat's like that yelp doctor saying,\n\n28:59.740 --> 29:01.740\nyou definitely have A.G.D.\n\n29:01.740 --> 29:03.740\nWell, yeah, I mean, I guess it would be like\n\n29:03.740 --> 29:06.740\nif they were like no cancer or like something,\n\n29:06.740 --> 29:09.740\nyou can't determine these things.\n\n29:09.740 --> 29:11.740\nCancer's not a good place to go.\n\n29:11.740 --> 29:12.740\nFound that out.\n\n29:12.740 --> 29:15.740\nHey, I have a new segment.\n\n29:18.740 --> 29:20.740\nDo you?\n\n29:23.740 --> 29:27.740\nDan, if you don't have a segment, don't lie about it.\n\n29:27.740 --> 29:29.740\nIt's called Uber Confessions.\n\n29:29.740 --> 29:32.740\nUber Confessions!\n\n29:32.740 --> 29:37.740\nSometimes you're in a car, but you don't want to drive\n\n29:37.740 --> 29:39.740\nbecause it's too far, or you're too drunk\n\n29:39.740 --> 29:41.740\nso you have someone else drive you.\n\n29:41.740 --> 29:43.740\nAnd they're Armenian.\n\n29:50.740 --> 29:52.740\nMy first Uber Confession...\n\n29:52.740 --> 29:54.740\nI have two Uber Confessions tonight.\n\n29:54.740 --> 29:57.740\nMy first Uber Confession is that every time\n\n29:57.740 --> 30:01.740\nsomeone drops me off at my house and says,\n\n30:01.740 --> 30:04.740\nyou have a beautiful home, my first reaction?\n\n30:04.740 --> 30:06.740\nPanic.\n\n30:06.740 --> 30:08.740\nThat's my first confession.\n\n30:08.740 --> 30:11.740\nValue my candor, don't punish me for it.\n\n30:16.740 --> 30:20.740\nMy second Uber Confession is that I just finally realized\n\n30:20.740 --> 30:22.740\nI was looking down at the bottom tabs.\n\n30:22.740 --> 30:25.740\nI've been using an American Express card\n\n30:25.740 --> 30:29.740\nto call Ubers since I decided to not buy a car,\n\n30:29.740 --> 30:31.740\nwhich was a long time ago,\n\n30:31.740 --> 30:34.740\nand I have been fucking flat.\n\n30:34.740 --> 30:38.740\nThere's a little tab down there with the American Express card,\n\n30:38.740 --> 30:41.740\nand it says, pay with this card,\n\n30:41.740 --> 30:43.740\nand then I notice another tab next to it that says,\n\n30:43.740 --> 30:44.740\nuse points.\n\n30:44.740 --> 30:46.740\nI'm like, use points.\n\n30:46.740 --> 30:48.740\nI click on it.\n\n30:48.740 --> 30:54.740\nI have 1.07 million membership rewards points,\n\n30:54.740 --> 31:00.740\nwhich translates to $10,766 worth of Uber rides.\n\n31:02.740 --> 31:06.740\nWhich means I haven't done the math,\n\n31:06.740 --> 31:09.740\nbut I can never get a car.\n\n31:09.740 --> 31:11.740\nBecause of all the money I've clearly blown on Uber,\n\n31:11.740 --> 31:13.740\nit now means I'll be blowing even more money\n\n31:13.740 --> 31:15.740\nif I don't use all these points.\n\n31:15.740 --> 31:18.740\nAnd those are my Uber Confessions.\n\n31:18.740 --> 31:25.740\nYo, it smells like cologne in here.\n\n31:25.740 --> 31:26.740\nIs there a button?\n\n31:26.740 --> 31:28.740\nA no cologne button on the app, please?\n\n31:28.740 --> 31:30.740\nA no cologne button.\n\n31:30.740 --> 31:33.740\nOh, now it smells like cigarettes.\n\n31:35.740 --> 31:38.740\nA no cologne button, that would be good, right, buddy?\n\n31:38.740 --> 31:41.740\nLike, park your car with a valet,\n\n31:41.740 --> 31:43.740\nand you get in your car,\n\n31:43.740 --> 31:45.740\nand the valet guy gets out,\n\n31:45.740 --> 31:47.740\nand my car smells like your cologne\n\n31:47.740 --> 31:49.740\nfor the rest of time.\n\n31:49.740 --> 31:52.740\nThat's an occupation where you should not be allowed\n\n31:52.740 --> 31:55.740\nto wear all the cologne.\n\n31:55.740 --> 31:57.740\nIt's unregulated, man.\n\n31:57.740 --> 31:59.740\nA flight attendant should not be able\n\n31:59.740 --> 32:01.740\nto wear all the perfume or cologne.\n\n32:01.740 --> 32:03.740\nI was in a southwest flight where a woman\n\n32:03.740 --> 32:06.740\nhad so much cologne, I moved to the back of the plane\n\n32:06.740 --> 32:08.740\nbecause I couldn't breathe,\n\n32:08.740 --> 32:11.740\nand I called the FAA and had her killed.\n\n32:13.740 --> 32:16.740\nWhich I thought was too far.\n\n32:16.740 --> 32:18.740\nWell, at least you're...\n\n32:18.740 --> 32:20.740\nI did regret it.\n\n32:20.740 --> 32:22.740\nAlso, I lost my voice today\n\n32:22.740 --> 32:24.740\ncheering for a U.S. women's soccer team.\n\n32:30.740 --> 32:32.740\nSo, speaking of feminism,\n\n32:35.740 --> 32:37.740\nAaron hired a guy to clean out our garage today\n\n32:37.740 --> 32:39.740\nbecause there's like a lot of...\n\n32:39.740 --> 32:41.740\nThat is feminist.\n\n32:42.740 --> 32:44.740\nThere's a lot of like...\n\n32:44.740 --> 32:48.740\nThe glorious denim of hiring people.\n\n32:49.740 --> 32:52.740\nThe garage of my home is like...\n\n32:52.740 --> 32:55.740\nThe back and side walls are all dirt,\n\n32:55.740 --> 32:57.740\nas high as the garage's roof.\n\n32:57.740 --> 33:00.740\nIt's kind of like an underground garage.\n\n33:00.740 --> 33:03.740\nYears and years, the house was built in 1929,\n\n33:03.740 --> 33:06.740\nhumble brag, not a humble brag, just a brag.\n\n33:09.740 --> 33:12.740\nAll the water has just been slowly seeping\n\n33:12.740 --> 33:14.740\ninto the walls of the garage,\n\n33:14.740 --> 33:16.740\nand the things are ready to fall apart.\n\n33:16.740 --> 33:18.740\nBut I had so... Spencer helped me hire\n\n33:18.740 --> 33:20.740\nthese landscaper guys,\n\n33:20.740 --> 33:22.740\nlike dig these trenches and these steel...\n\n33:22.740 --> 33:24.740\nAnyway, that's not really important to the story.\n\n33:24.740 --> 33:26.740\nI think it is.\n\n33:26.740 --> 33:28.740\nWe got the garage, which always...\n\n33:28.740 --> 33:30.740\nIf you went in there and took a whiff,\n\n33:30.740 --> 33:33.740\nyou'd be like, I'm certainly going to die of black mold.\n\n33:33.740 --> 33:35.740\nLike, oh, by the way!\n\n33:35.740 --> 33:37.740\nWait!\n\n33:38.740 --> 33:40.740\nEverybody get out.\n\n33:40.740 --> 33:42.740\nIf they can come back in,\n\n33:42.740 --> 33:44.740\nwe're going to start the show over.\n\n33:44.740 --> 33:46.740\nWhat was her name, the poor young lady,\n\n33:46.740 --> 33:48.740\nthe actress that she...\n\n33:48.740 --> 33:50.740\nBrittany Murphy.\n\n33:50.740 --> 33:51.740\nDo you guys read about that?\n\n33:51.740 --> 33:52.740\nIt wasn't as publicized.\n\n33:52.740 --> 33:53.740\nI keep spitting on you, Willie.\n\n33:53.740 --> 33:55.740\nYou're in the splash zone, sorry.\n\n33:55.740 --> 33:57.740\nIt's just vodka for my mustache.\n\n33:57.740 --> 33:59.740\nLike, I took a bath today.\n\n33:59.740 --> 34:01.740\nEpsom salts and vodka.\n\n34:02.740 --> 34:04.740\nAnd just a little bit of a...\n\n34:04.740 --> 34:05.740\nKey and P...\n\n34:05.740 --> 34:07.740\nFraud complex.\n\n34:07.740 --> 34:09.740\nJust a hint.\n\n34:09.740 --> 34:11.740\nThe...\n\n34:11.740 --> 34:13.740\nEverybody kind of characterized...\n\n34:13.740 --> 34:15.740\nOh, she died and was kind of characterized\n\n34:15.740 --> 34:17.740\nas drug overdose and stuff.\n\n34:17.740 --> 34:19.740\nHer husband died.\n\n34:19.740 --> 34:21.740\nThey had black mold in their shower.\n\n34:23.740 --> 34:25.740\nThey died of the same thing.\n\n34:25.740 --> 34:27.740\nAnd because they...\n\n34:27.740 --> 34:29.740\nI mean, fucking horrible.\n\n34:29.740 --> 34:31.740\nAnd terrifying.\n\n34:31.740 --> 34:33.740\nThere's nothing good about that.\n\n34:33.740 --> 34:35.740\nThere's no silver. Try to find the silver lining of that one.\n\n34:35.740 --> 34:37.740\nWhat's really terrifying is the symptoms\n\n34:37.740 --> 34:39.740\nof mold poisoning\n\n34:39.740 --> 34:41.740\ncan lead from,

35:11.740\nHe's...\n\n35:11.740 --> 35:13.740\nThere must be gold buried over there.\n\n35:15.740 --> 35:17.740\nNo, it's black mold.\n\n35:17.740 --> 35:19.740\nIt's not gold.\n\n35:21.740 --> 35:23.740\nYou can only hear tea.\n\n35:23.740 --> 35:25.740\nTexas, there's oil in the back.\n\n35:25.740 --> 35:27.740\nThat's why ghosts are so misunderstood.\n\n35:27.740 --> 35:29.740\nYou can only hear their vowels.\n\n35:29.740 --> 35:31.740\nThey're not saying boo, they're saying...\n\n35:31.740 --> 35:33.740\nThey're saying drew.\n\n35:33.740 --> 35:35.740\nThey're saying drew.\n\n35:35.740 --> 35:37.740\nThey're saying drew.\n\n35:41.740 --> 35:43.740\nThey're saying chew.\n\n35:43.740 --> 35:45.740\nThey don't want you to choke like they did.\n\n35:47.740 --> 35:49.740\n20 times, it seems excessive, but...\n\n35:55.740 --> 35:57.740\nThe ghost is just murmuring at me.\n\n35:59.740 --> 36:01.740\nAll right, black mold.\n\n36:01.740 --> 36:03.740\nSo, yeah, so you would go in my garage\n\n36:03.740 --> 36:05.740\nand be like, oh, God, this is a death trap.\n\n36:07.740 --> 36:09.740\nSo we sealed it off on the outside.\n\n36:09.740 --> 36:11.740\nBig, expensive landscaping job.\n\n36:11.740 --> 36:13.740\nAnd then because we did that now,\n\n36:13.740 --> 36:15.740\ntoday, Aaron hired a task rabbit,\n\n36:15.740 --> 36:17.740\nI'm familiar with this,\n\n36:17.740 --> 36:19.740\nto come and, like, help clean out the garage.\n\n36:19.740 --> 36:21.740\nSo he goes up, so there's a bunch of stuff\n\n36:21.740 --> 36:23.740\nin the storage there, big cardboard boxes\n\n36:23.740 --> 36:25.740\nfull of stuff that we've put into cold storage up there.\n\n36:27.740 --> 36:29.740\nAll water damage, because of the water it's seeping through.\n\n36:29.740 --> 36:31.740\nSo I wasn't down there,\n\n36:31.740 --> 36:33.740\nAaron came up and reported this to me,\n\n36:33.740 --> 36:35.740\nthat the guy reached up, touched the first box\n\n36:35.740 --> 36:37.740\non the top left, and it disintegrated in his hands\n\n36:37.740 --> 36:41.740\nand a thousand porn magazines just...\n\n36:43.740 --> 36:47.740\nflooded, like, Stanley Kubrick's blood elevator, just...\n\n36:49.740 --> 36:51.740\njust nothing but, like, 10 years\n\n36:51.740 --> 36:55.740\nof pre-internet obsessive-compulsive hoarding of porn.\n\n36:55.740 --> 36:57.740\nYup.\n\n36:57.740 --> 36:59.740\nI was trying to explain to Aaron,\n\n36:59.740 --> 37:01.740\nI was like, you don't understand,\n\n37:01.740 --> 37:03.740\nshe's 12 years younger than me,\n\n37:03.740 --> 37:05.740\nI'm like, before the internet,\n\n37:05.740 --> 37:09.740\nyou never knew if you were going to see this lady again.\n\n37:11.740 --> 37:13.740\nAnd she's like, then why buy more?\n\n37:13.740 --> 37:15.740\nAnd I'm like, well, because you're done,\n\n37:15.740 --> 37:17.740\nand then you need more.\n\n37:19.740 --> 37:21.740\nWhy put it in a box?\n\n37:21.740 --> 37:23.740\nBecause I put it in a box before the internet.\n\n37:23.740 --> 37:25.740\nAnd the funny thing is,\n\n37:25.740 --> 37:27.740\nI realized, like, yeah,\n\n37:27.740 --> 37:29.740\nbecause then remember, guys my age,\n\n37:29.740 --> 37:31.740\nlike, when you first started,\n\n37:31.740 --> 37:33.740\nlike, really, we all had, like, a folder,\n\n37:33.740 --> 37:35.740\nyou know, somewhere hidden away,\n\n37:35.740 --> 37:37.740\nwhere it was like the same instinct,\n\n37:37.740 --> 37:39.740\nit was like, you got to hoard this porn,\n\n37:39.740 --> 37:41.740\nbut it's everywhere, and it's like,\n\n37:41.740 --> 37:43.740\ndo you realize the reason that folder is so full\n\n37:43.740 --> 37:45.740\nis because the porn will never end\n\n37:45.740 --> 37:47.740\nand you don't need it?\n\n37:47.740 --> 37:49.740\nAnd now, finally, I've caught up with the rest of the world,\n\n37:49.740 --> 37:51.740\nwe're all like, we're just awash in porn,\n\n37:51.740 --> 37:53.740\nlike, why would you ever save anything?\n\n37:53.740 --> 37:55.740\nNo, why do you still have those boxes?\n\n37:55.740 --> 37:57.740\nWhy not, like, throw those out?\n\n37:57.740 --> 37:59.740\nBecause not only were those boxes filled\n\n37:59.740 --> 38:01.740\nlong ago, they were also, like,\n\n38:01.740 --> 38:03.740\npacked away long ago, so there were just boxes that were,\n\n38:03.740 --> 38:05.740\nthose boxes were,\n\n38:05.740 --> 38:07.740\nthose boxes were still sealed,\n\n38:07.740 --> 38:09.740\nyou know, before I moved into that house,\n\n38:09.740 --> 38:11.740\nand then it just, just take the boxes with you.\n\n38:11.740 --> 38:13.740\nYou had a folder, like a little,\n\n38:13.740 --> 38:15.740\nlike, manila folder,\n\n38:15.740 --> 38:17.740\nthat was pieces of porn that you had torn out.\n\n38:17.740 --> 38:19.740\nYeah, because I would try to console,\n\n38:19.740 --> 38:21.740\nlike, okay, it's like,\n\n38:21.740 --> 38:23.740\nit's like archiving your hard drive\n\n38:23.740 --> 38:25.740\nor, like, compressing it, like a zip file.\n\n38:25.740 --> 38:27.740\nLike, okay, well, what's really,\n\n38:27.740 --> 38:29.740\nwell, let's get all the redheads out of here and,\n\n38:29.740 --> 38:31.740\nlike, it's becoming,\n\n38:31.740 --> 38:33.740\nit's becoming a space problem,\n\n38:33.740 --> 38:35.740\nit's becoming an actual physical space problem.\n\n38:35.740 --> 38:37.740\nYou had a closet that was, like,\n\n38:37.740 --> 38:39.740\nfloor to ceiling, just playboys\n\n38:39.740 --> 38:41.740\nand stuff, but you had this one,\n\n38:41.740 --> 38:43.740\nlike, pretty full manila folder,\n\n38:43.740 --> 38:45.740\nso I was leafing through it,\n\n38:45.740 --> 38:47.740\nI'm like, wow, you were like redheads,\n\n38:47.740 --> 38:49.740\nlike, what?\n\n38:49.740 --> 38:51.740\nYou were like, oh, fuck, I do.\n\n38:51.740 --> 38:53.740\nYeah.\n\n38:53.740 --> 38:55.740\nI just

noticed that.\n\n39:01.740 --> 39:03.740\nI go by hair and eyebrows.\n\n39:03.740 --> 39:05.740\nI didn't know there was Dave Kline,\n\n39:05.740 --> 39:07.740\nwe were arguing, so he was on the camera,\n\n39:07.740 --> 39:09.740\nis that Dave Kline, you know,\n\n39:09.740 --> 39:11.740\nor any guy with blonde hair and a beard?\n\n39:11.740 --> 39:13.740\nBecause it could be anybody.\n\n39:13.740 --> 39:15.740\nAnd if Dave Kline had dark hair,\n\n39:15.740 --> 39:17.740\nif he had red hair,\n\n39:17.740 --> 39:19.740\nhe'd be in your folder.\n\n39:27.740 -->

this brick wall\n\n01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.740\nwhere we all know what's going on\n\n01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:01.740\nthere's this uncomfortable moment\n\n01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:03.740\nit's almost like a reverse handshake\n\n01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:05.740\nwhere Jordan Peele\n\n01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.740\ncame in and did\n\n01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:09.740\nthis time monster\n\n01:20:09.740 -->

black\n\n01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.740\nbut\n\n01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.740\nvery\n\n01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.740\nand it's not my friend\n\n01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:31.740\nkitchen fresh

ever\n\n01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.740\nfrom one of the greatest actors of all time\n\n01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.740\nand you'll recognize it's the guy that said\n\n01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:55.740\na

01:21:13.740\nif they find it it will go viral\n\n01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:15.740\nit was a black McDonald's ad\n\n01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:17.740\nI think targeted at the Grammys\n\n01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:19.740\nwith James Brown in it\n\n01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:21.740\nbut only for a moment and it's black kids in a McDonald's\n\n01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:23.740\ngoing oh they run up to the

01:22:55.740\ntry out the bucket seats you know\n\n01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:57.740\nit was always that kind of stuff as opposed to\n\n01:22:57.740 --> 01:22:59.740\njust other ads which were subtle and\n\n01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.740\nweirder and stuff but what was great was\n\n01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:03.740\nthere were other ads with black people in them\n\n01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:05.740\nthat didn't even target race like there was a\n\n01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:07.740\nlittle Caesar dad or something\n\n01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:09.740\nno no it was the same people who made the

to get the clearest\n\n01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:05.740\npicture it's the same thing about soccer\n\n01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.740\nperceptions of soccer and that kind of stuff and like\n\n01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:09.740\nI've never known a world where soccer didn't rule\n\n01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.740\nand everybody was into it and it was a thing\n\n01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:13.740\nand I grew up along most people who I think\n\n01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:15.740\nfor a while like oh no no never catch on it's like\n\n01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:17.740\neverybody I know played it and in black\n\n01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.740\nthere's a world where\n\n01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.740\nI know that everybody\n\n01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.740\nmy relatives my friends and their relatives they buy\n\n01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:25.740\neverything that everybody else buys our consumer\n\n01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:27.740\ndollars worth everything everybody else's is\n\n01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:29.740\nbut also people made fun of that movie Rachel's\n\n01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:31.740\nwedding because they're like no combinations of\n\n01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.740\npeople f of any ethnicity exists like\n\n01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:35.740\nthis and do these kinds of things that's all I ever\n\n01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:37.740\nknew growing up and I knew grew up\n\n01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.740\naround all these people these

are subtle and\n\n01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.740\ndelightful you get ads that are\n\n01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:51.740\nthat are target to everybody but are\n\n01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:53.740\nprimarily\n\n01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.740\nblack just by ethnicity because they're putting\n\n01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:57.740\na black family on for the first time or black\n\n01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:59.740\nhusband and wife or\n\n01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:01.740\ncouples of mixed ethnicity\n\n01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:03.740\nconfusing is because when you go like

--> 01:25:15.740\nyou know what if what if we treated\n\n01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:17.740\nthis segment of the\n\n01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:19.740\nviewing audience as if they also\n\n01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.740\nwere human beings which entails\n\n01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:23.740\nsomething that any on any other\n\n01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.740\nday you could go like well that's also\n\n01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:27.740\nyou know like like it just\n\n01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:29.740\ntwists my fucking brain and I'll\n\n01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:31.740\ngo to my grave awkward this is just what

out\n\n01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:39.740\nwhere the whole all of it is all about the fact\n\n01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:41.740\nthat we're capable of so much more our brains\n\n01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:43.740\nare capable of holding all of it in\n\n01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:45.740\nand we don't have to necessarily\n\n01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.740\ncontinue to\n\n01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:49.740\ngeneralize to get\n\n01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:51.740\nwider to understand\n\n01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:53.740\neverything on infinite detail we can actually\n\n01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:55.740\nstay on macro and\n\n01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.740\ntake everything in at its own\n\n01:25:57.740 --> 01:25:59.740\ndetail and say you know like\n\n01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.740\nwhen Tiger Woods was first becoming a thing\n\n01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.740\nand he's like look my mom's time\n\n01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:05.740\nmy dad's black but there's also Mixer's parentage\n\n01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.740\nand me of other things so you're telling me\n\n01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.740\nthat you want me to tell you what I am once you just\n\n01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.740\nask me about the golf game and not worry about\n\n01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:13.740\nthat shit. Which is great that's like why\n\n01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:15.740\nthe transgender movement might be the\n\n01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:17.740\nthe Christ of this\n\n01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:19.740\nyou know because\n\n01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:21.740\nbecause there will never be a\n\n01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:23.740\nI shouldn't say this is gonna I'm sure this will\n\n01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:25.740\nget twisted into something inflammatory\n\n01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.740\nbut believe me\n\n01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.740\nthere will never be\n\n01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:31.740\nthere will never be such a\n\n01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.740\nit's never gonna be like\n\n01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.740\nlook out the window at all those transgender\n\n01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.740\npeople senator\n\n01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:39.740\nlike there's gonna be\n\n01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.740\nI mean there's 700,000\n\n01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:43.740\nyou know\n\n01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:45.740\nout openly transgender\n\n01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.740\npeople right now and there's you can probably\n\n01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:49.740\nthere's a lot of people I'm just saying like\n\n01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:51.740\nwe can't keep waiting for this they're like this little tiny\n\n01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.740\nkey that could unravel the whole thing because\n\n01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.740\nthe\n\n01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:57.740\nJohn Oliver just did this\n\n01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.740\npiece on his show about the whole\n\n01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:01.740\ntransgender thing and it really just again like flip\n\n01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:03.740\nflop my brain about everything because\n\n01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:05.740\nlike we're it's one thing to talk\n\n01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.740\nabout this culturally but now it's like there's laws\n\n01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.740\nthey're passing laws in different\n\n01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.740\nplaces that you have to use the bathroom\n\n01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:13.740\nthat corresponds to the\n\n01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:15.740\ngenitalia that you were born with\n\n01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.740\nnot the gender that you identify\n\n01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:19.740\nwith so there and they're\n\n01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.740\nrunning ads for like these local\n\n01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:23.740\nreferendums that are like\n\n01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:25.740\nthey'll show a little girl\n\n01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.740\ngoing into a women's room and then\n\n01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.740\na dude with a baseball cap\n\n01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.740\nand a goatee looking around and then going into\n\n01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:33.740\nthe women's room after her and saying\n\n01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:35.740\nthis is what you're voting for\n\n01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:37.740\nor this you know because because there's because\n\n01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:39.740\nthe idea is that if you identify as\n\n01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.740\nas a the idea is that that guy\n\n01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:43.740\nin the baseball cap can say\n\n01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:45.740\nI identify as a woman so I'm gonna go molester\n\n01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:47.740\ngirl in the bathroom like as if that's\n\n01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:49.740\nthat's the slippery slope we're on and\n\n01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:51.740\nmy point is like there's like there's\n\n01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:53.740\ntorturous things happening to people who\n\n01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:55.740\nrepresent really the end all be all\n\n01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:57.740\nof like the final thresholds that we\n\n01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.740\nreally thought we could call thresholds\n\n01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:01.740\nand and I think what you're saying\n\n01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.740\nis that the macro statement like we can\n\n01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:05.740\nlive in the macro we have the capacity\n\n01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:07.740\nfor it we're primates we we can do it\n\n01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:09.740\nand and the\n\n01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.740\nthe guy in the four agreements said\n\n01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:13.740\nthe same thing\n\n01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:15.740\nour brains are designed\n\n01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.740\nto experience everything\n\n01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:19.740\nat the same time we're back our brains\n\n01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:21.740\nare our brains are not designed\n\n01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:23.740\nto have they don't have to always\n\n01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:25.740\nhave like this this flashlight\n\n01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:27.740\nbeam that only shines on one\n\n01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:29.740\nthing and thinks about one thing at once\n\n01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:31.740\nwe can think a million things at once\n\n01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:33.740\nand the and we can we can definitely\n\n01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:35.740\nthink like well like let's\n\n01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:37.740\nfor instance you could you could you could\n\n01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:39.740\ndefinitely decide as a society\n\n01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:41.740\nto go well let's make sure everybody's\n\n01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:43.740\nhappy like like you could you could\n\n01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:45.740\nbuild that as the bottom foundation\n\n01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:47.740\nyou could build everything else on top of it\n\n01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.740\nbut we're we\n\n01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.740\nwe're living in a world that was created\n\n01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:53.740\nlike so long ago by people that\n\n01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:55.740\ndidn't even see these days coming when\n\n01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:57.740\nthese questions could we would have the luxury\n\n01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:59.740\nof answer asking these questions but\n\n01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.740\nbut the the I don't know I just got excited\n\n01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:03.740\nwhen you said that because I was thinking about that\n\n01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:05.740\npiece and like feeling the guilt inside of me\n\n01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.740\nand going like oh my god well\n\n01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.740\nlike like like that's what this\n\n01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:11.740\ntransgender like concept is\n\n01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:13.740\ndoing to people right now is\n\n01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:15.740\nlike we're all going\n\n01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:17.740\noh I don't know\n\n01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:19.740\nI've heard myself say out loud\n\n01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:21.740\nlike oh come on you know\n\n01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:23.740\nlike about various things like I thought that's\n\n01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.740\nwhere you could draw the line like well give me a break\n\n01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:27.740\nand it's like well we're\n\n01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:29.740\nwhy are you drawing the line there and it's like we'll take that\n\n01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.740\nline away and take that line away and take that line away\n\n01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:33.740\nwhat do you think the worst case scenario is\n\n01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:35.740\nwhere everything is just how people\n\n01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.740\nwant it to be like like\n\n01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:39.740\nlike what what do you think would happen\n\n01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.740\nand and I just\n\n01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.740\nwanted to co-opt what\n\n01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.740\nyou were saying and turn it into a transgender piece so\n\n01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:47.740\nbut I feel\n\n01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:49.740\nI feel like it's the
