00:00.000 --> 00:08.740
Oh, shit! Welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California!

00:17.240 --> 00:23.740
Harmontown is now in session. Spencer Crittenden, your Dungeon Master. Spencer.

00:23.740 --> 00:33.740
And the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon!

00:38.740 --> 00:41.740
Thank you! Thank you very much!

00:42.740 --> 00:47.740
Alright, so I threw out my back yesterday.

00:47.740 --> 00:53.740
For real? Yeah, and it hurts a lot, and it's hard to walk.

00:53.740 --> 01:05.740
And today, Erin drew a bath for me, and she, it's my wife Erin, she, it wasn't Erin Sorkin.

01:09.740 --> 01:11.740
I asked him, but...

01:11.740 --> 01:12.740
That's a better story!

01:12.740 --> 01:19.740
Yeah, I mean, his take on it would be too dramatic, too clever.

01:19.740 --> 01:21.740
Just draw me a bath.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.740
What would an Erin Sorkin bath look like, do you think?

01:24.740 --> 01:31.740
It would be ironic, you know, it would be like, it would have a picture of a desert above it, I don't know.

01:31.740 --> 01:36.740
It would improvise what Erin Sorkin's style is.

01:36.740 --> 01:43.740
So she runs me a bath, very nice of her, she puts all these Epsom salts in it, maybe this will help your bad back.

01:43.740 --> 01:48.740
And she's like, do you want me to put some music on? I said, yeah, just put something on.

01:48.740 --> 01:56.740
And she puts on, you know, probably in a genuine attempt to make me feel comfortable, not mockingly.

01:56.740 --> 02:00.740
She puts on 90s alternative hits.

02:00.740 --> 02:02.740
It's like a station.

02:02.740 --> 02:10.740
I'm like, oh, this doesn't make me comfortable with 90s alternative hits.

02:10.740 --> 02:13.740
It's soothing my back and some Epsom salts.

02:13.740 --> 02:15.740
And then it's like a radio station.

02:15.740 --> 02:23.740
And then the commercial on the radio station for the 90s alternative hits is for a hospital that specializes in hip pain.

02:23.740 --> 02:32.740
And that's a real actual thing that happened today, just sitting there in the tub.

02:32.740 --> 02:37.740
And then another thing that made me feel old, but in a good way, was I watched Kung Fury.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.740
Did you see this thing, Kung Fury?

02:39.740 --> 02:45.740
That was another woody in Toy Story moment for me.

02:45.740 --> 02:52.740
The box opening and Kung Fury coming out and me going, oh, I'm retiring now.

02:52.740 --> 02:56.740
I guess that's very presumptuous of me to say.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.740
There's a lot of talent and passion.

02:58.740 --> 03:00.740
You got to check it out. It's very great.

03:00.740 --> 03:04.740
It's like 25 minutes of just nonstop passion for the 80s.

03:04.740 --> 03:11.740
I would never have clicked on it because there's been so much hack shit that has Kung in the title.

03:11.740 --> 03:15.740
It just sounds like something you'd probably nine times out of ten.

03:15.740 --> 03:17.740
Kung Fu Panda.

03:17.740 --> 03:22.740
It's just too much shit. Somebody sends me a video and goes, oh, you should watch this.

03:22.740 --> 03:23.740
It's called Kung Fury.

03:23.740 --> 03:26.740
I'm not going to. I did it because of my bad back.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.740
Really, I couldn't do anything else except watch stuff.

03:29.740 --> 03:33.740
So I clicked on it and then I was just drawn in and it's really, really good.

03:33.740 --> 03:40.740
All you have to do is give it 30 seconds and you're either going to watch the full 25 or not, but it's really good.

03:40.740 --> 03:43.740
It was kind of a coming of age day for that reason.

03:43.740 --> 03:49.740
Because it's like a celebration of 80s VHS, direct-to-video kind of action films,

03:49.740 --> 03:53.740
but simultaneously is like taking advantage of today's technology.

03:53.740 --> 03:58.740
It was kick started by someone who appears to be probably a younger man.

03:58.740 --> 04:01.740
I've never seen him before.

04:01.740 --> 04:07.740
It just felt the obsolescence, my obsolescence emanating off of this thing.

04:07.740 --> 04:16.740
I texted Schrab and said, man, I'm really glad this guy waited to show up until after you and I were validated.

04:16.740 --> 04:22.740
Because if I had been in the break room at Target and seen that, I would have gotten in my car,

04:22.740 --> 04:27.740
driven to the desert, stopped at the first cow skull,

04:27.740 --> 04:30.740
and just gotten out and just started walking.

04:30.740 --> 04:39.740
And I either would have faded down on me walking or I would have just dissolved like Ice Cube and Boys in the Hood.

04:39.740 --> 04:42.740
Meaning I died, I guess.

04:42.740 --> 04:47.740
Ice Cube died, right? That's why he faded away.

04:47.740 --> 04:50.740
Is that Dave Kline?

04:50.740 --> 04:52.740
Hey, Dave Kline, how are you?

04:52.740 --> 04:54.740
I was right. It was Dave Kline.

04:54.740 --> 04:58.740
Dave Kline is sitting in the sweet spot with a camera for the home listener.

04:58.740 --> 05:00.740
One of them pointed right at Dave Kline.

05:00.740 --> 05:04.740
That's right. It's a Klein cam.

05:04.740 --> 05:07.740
Dan, under what circumstances did you hurt your back?

05:07.740 --> 05:11.740
I think I was just like, it takes very little.

05:11.740 --> 05:14.740
I've had a bad back since I was 17.

05:14.740 --> 05:18.740
I come from a long line of bad backs and I do.

05:18.740 --> 05:22.740
Everyone in my family has a fucked up back.

05:22.740 --> 05:25.740
I'd pick it off of a list of things that could be fucked up about me.

05:25.740 --> 05:28.740
I don't want asthma. I don't want certain allergies.

05:28.740 --> 05:34.740
I'll take a bad back, but it makes it really hard to do physical labor.

05:34.740 --> 05:36.740
That's the big downside.

05:36.740 --> 05:39.740
Boo-hoo.

05:39.740 --> 05:43.740
But sometimes if I do too much twisting and bending,

05:43.740 --> 05:47.740
I was rearranging my office and I think I just did a certain combination of things.

05:47.740 --> 05:50.740
And then I tried to get on my inversion table.

05:50.740 --> 05:54.740
I have this Michael Keaton gravity boot thing that usually knocks it out.

05:54.740 --> 05:57.740
But this time maybe I did it wrong or something.

05:57.740 --> 06:00.740
And then I was like, ow, ow, ow, ow.

06:00.740 --> 06:03.740
And I couldn't even play video games. It hurt so bad.

06:03.740 --> 06:05.740
Because that involves sitting up.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.740
You couldn't sit down?

06:06.740 --> 06:09.740
I can barely be standing here. I'm a hero for standing here.

06:09.740 --> 06:12.740
Thank you.

06:12.740 --> 06:18.740
Yeah, let's see a firefighter do this.

06:18.740 --> 06:23.740
Take some time off his jeans-stealing schedule.

06:23.740 --> 06:27.740
These guys can't stop stealing jeans.

06:27.740 --> 06:29.740
That's why they become firefighters.

06:29.740 --> 06:32.740
They're like, mmm, free jeans.

06:32.740 --> 06:37.740
If you're a firefighter and this is your first episode, it's a callback.

06:37.740 --> 06:42.740
I don't believe you stole jeans during 9-11.

06:42.740 --> 06:44.740
I know that's an urban myth.

06:44.740 --> 06:47.740
It's an urban myth that entertains me.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.740
I'm calling back to the joke.

06:49.740 --> 06:55.740
There's also an urban myth that firefighters come to our podcast.

06:55.740 --> 07:02.740
Or they're out there watching on their little fireproof laptops.

07:02.740 --> 07:08.740
Have you seen the Little Caesar commercial where the...

07:08.740 --> 07:11.740
Little Caesars has this ad for this guy.

07:11.740 --> 07:13.740
This is related to laptops.

07:13.740 --> 07:16.740
Little Caesars has this guy because Little Caesars is doing this campaign

07:16.740 --> 07:26.740
to try to convince you that ordering their pizza is easier than ordering online.

07:26.740 --> 07:28.740
They're doing these commercials where it's like,

07:28.740 --> 07:30.740
yeah, man, this is so much easier.

07:30.740 --> 07:35.740
They're vilifying the process of ordering pizza online.

07:35.740 --> 07:38.740
I don't know how they think that that's going to...

07:38.740 --> 07:41.740
One of the commercials I saw today, because I have a bad back,

07:41.740 --> 07:45.740
I was just watching Key and Peele all day and watching these shitty commercials.

07:45.740 --> 07:49.740
There's a guy who goes like, hey, can I get two pizzas?

07:49.740 --> 07:51.740
And his hands are below the counter.

07:51.740 --> 07:54.740
And she goes, yeah, that'll be whatever, a fucking 99 or whatever.

07:54.740 --> 07:59.740
And he goes, thanks, you have no idea how much easier it is than ordering online.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.740
And he lifts his hands...

08:01.740 --> 08:03.740
So he's lifting his hands.

08:03.740 --> 08:13.740
Both of his hands have been thrust through the backside of computer monitors on laptops.

08:13.740 --> 08:18.740
Because it wouldn't read otherwise as a laptop.

08:18.740 --> 08:22.740
The idea is he's been so frustrated with his computers

08:22.740 --> 08:26.740
and such a pussy that he had to sneak up on them.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.740
I was like, I'll be right back.

08:28.740 --> 08:33.740
No, it's because obviously they're in the production meeting and they're like,

08:33.740 --> 08:39.740
oh, but all laptops just look like slabs of nothingness from behind.

08:39.740 --> 08:43.740
Oh, well, we'll just turn around. Julie, can we just turn around?

08:43.740 --> 08:47.740
Yeah, yeah, just give me a second, we'll turn around.

08:47.740 --> 08:51.740
Nobody was like, the actor's like, I don't fucking care, I'm on a pizza commercial.

08:51.740 --> 08:55.740
I already want to kill myself.

08:55.740 --> 08:57.740
I'm not going to argue with these people.

08:57.740 --> 08:59.740
I'm not going to be the actor that had to do a pizza commercial

08:59.740 --> 09:02.740
and was high maintenance about it.

09:02.740 --> 09:05.740
I'm just going to do this and get out of here.

09:05.740 --> 09:10.740
The idea being that he tried to order online and his hands went through a computer?

09:10.740 --> 09:16.740
Well, because I'm assuming the idea is that he was trying to order a pizza online and couldn't.

09:16.740 --> 09:20.740
And then he told his computer to turn around.

09:20.740 --> 09:23.740
Look over there.

09:23.740 --> 09:26.740
I mean, the idea is that he would have punched in frustration,

09:26.740 --> 09:30.740
but it looks like his computer was so ashamed that it couldn't order pizza for him

09:30.740 --> 09:34.740
that it went down to the river like Lenny of Mice and Men.

09:34.740 --> 09:41.740
And he sympathetically, euthanistically dispatched it.

09:41.740 --> 09:46.740
And he's just saying to the lady, it's much easier to go through little Caesars.

09:46.740 --> 09:51.740
And then during Key and Peel, which is awesome, I saw a bunch of Key and Speel,

09:51.740 --> 09:55.740
buried sketches that I have.

09:55.740 --> 09:58.740
It's nice when you go through a spate of not watching Key and Peel,

09:58.740 --> 10:00.740
you get to catch up with a lot of...

10:00.740 --> 10:02.740
These guys really go for it.

10:02.740 --> 10:05.740
We should have watered both of them on the show, he said.

10:05.740 --> 10:08.740
He said flagrently.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.740
Yup, we got a yup.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.740
Do we have a yup?

10:12.740 --> 10:15.740
The yups have it.

10:15.740 --> 10:20.740
Yeah, but it probably has to be one of them, they hate each other.

10:20.740 --> 10:21.740
They won't work together.

10:21.740 --> 10:22.740
No, that's kid in play.

10:22.740 --> 10:24.740
Oh, that's right, that's right.

10:24.740 --> 10:27.740
Wow.

10:27.740 --> 10:32.740
No, but they did voices.

10:32.740 --> 10:33.740
Was he right?

10:33.740 --> 10:35.740
Did you confuse kid in play?

10:35.740 --> 10:41.740
No, you just confused my joke for realsies.

10:41.740 --> 10:46.740
You're seeing double and one thing is the joke and for realsies are separate

10:46.740 --> 10:50.740
because you're seeing double, so you're looking at the for realsies.

10:50.740 --> 10:56.740
Focus on the joke half of your vision.

10:56.740 --> 11:02.740
They did voices for Rick and Morty, which I...

11:02.740 --> 11:09.740
Adult Swim didn't want us to talk about all the guest voices,

11:09.740 --> 11:13.740
but like 20% of our second season is leaked online,

11:13.740 --> 11:16.740
so you already know that they did voices.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.740
Unless you're one of these wonderful people who...

11:18.740 --> 11:19.740
And I don't even...

11:19.740 --> 11:21.740
I mean, I appreciate the sacrifice.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.740
I think people are tweeting me going,

11:23.740 --> 11:27.740
the two episodes that we sent out to press are leaked of Rick and Morty,

11:27.740 --> 11:31.740
and I'm not going to watch them until the date.

11:31.740 --> 11:32.740
I'd be with you, I think.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.740
I mean, I also don't...

11:34.740 --> 11:36.740
I don't fault anybody for doing it,

11:36.740 --> 11:39.740
but I don't care about the politics of it.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.740
I would just say from On Justin's behalf

11:42.740 --> 11:46.740
that we'd rather be finished with the episodes when you watch them

11:46.740 --> 11:49.740
and we'd rather you see them with the sound mixed and stuff like that.

11:49.740 --> 11:50.740
We're doing it for Justin.

11:50.740 --> 11:53.740
All right, good.

11:53.740 --> 11:56.740
Hashtag.

11:56.740 --> 12:00.740
And there was another commercial during the Key and Peels.

12:00.740 --> 12:03.740
So, okay, so, all right, so I'm 42.

12:03.740 --> 12:06.740
So a lot of this show is about me being open and honest

12:06.740 --> 12:09.740
about my racially obsessed 70s upbringing,

12:09.740 --> 12:11.740
the brain that's resulted in like,

12:11.740 --> 12:16.740
I'm struggling with a post-racial, a millennial generation,

12:16.740 --> 12:17.740
and I'm not...

12:17.740 --> 12:20.740
I think the second half of a proper life should be spent

12:20.740 --> 12:23.740
realizing how wrong you were for the first half,

12:23.740 --> 12:24.740
and I'm loving it.

12:24.740 --> 12:26.740
That's what this show is about to a large degree.

12:26.740 --> 12:27.740
I'm going to therapy now.

12:27.740 --> 12:29.740
You heard me swear off therapy,

12:29.740 --> 12:33.740
and I'm never going to like giraffes, but like...

12:33.740 --> 12:37.740
But so I'm confused about this one.

12:37.740 --> 12:39.740
So I'm watching Key and Peel,

12:39.740 --> 12:42.740
and then this McDonald's commercial comes on.

12:42.740 --> 12:44.740
I thought we stopped doing this.

12:44.740 --> 12:47.740
I thought this was like an 80s, 90s thing,

12:47.740 --> 12:49.740
and then we got embarrassed about it,

12:49.740 --> 12:52.740
the transparency of it, and stopped doing it.

12:52.740 --> 12:54.740
Maybe this is post now.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.740
Now it's like, well, why not do it?

12:56.740 --> 12:59.740
It's just like we're still doing the wrapping

12:59.740 --> 13:01.740
all Black people McDonald's commercials,

13:01.740 --> 13:04.740
the separate but equal McDonald's commercials

13:04.740 --> 13:07.740
where it's just all Black people,

13:07.740 --> 13:09.740
and the announcer's Black, and everyone's Black,

13:09.740 --> 13:11.740
and everyone's unified by Blackness,

13:11.740 --> 13:12.740
and loving McDonald's,

13:12.740 --> 13:15.740
and I can't figure out how I feel about it anymore,

13:15.740 --> 13:17.740
because we used to unilaterally go,

13:17.740 --> 13:19.740
well, this is ridiculous.

13:19.740 --> 13:21.740
This is a holdover from a time when we thought

13:21.740 --> 13:24.740
that race separated people,

13:24.740 --> 13:26.740
and that advertisers were catering to it,

13:26.740 --> 13:29.740
and now I have no idea how to feel about it,

13:29.740 --> 13:31.740
because they're clearly young and beautiful,

13:31.740 --> 13:33.740
and if I was part of a stereotype

13:33.740 --> 13:36.740
that made me look sexy

13:36.740 --> 13:39.740
and have a good time all the time

13:39.740 --> 13:40.740
when I was eating my cheeseburgers,

13:40.740 --> 13:42.740
and I saw the commercial, I might go like,

13:42.740 --> 13:43.740
well, now I want a cheeseburger,

13:43.740 --> 13:45.740
now that you're telling me white people

13:45.740 --> 13:46.740
do their white thing,

13:46.740 --> 13:48.740
and part of being white is looking good,

13:48.740 --> 13:51.740
and jamming out, and like,

13:51.740 --> 13:53.740
it's just like, it comes out, it's like,

13:53.740 --> 13:55.740
250 for a burger and fry,

13:55.740 --> 13:56.740
double, double, double, fry, fry,

13:56.740 --> 13:58.740
double, double, fry,

13:58.740 --> 14:01.740
and it makes no bones about it,

14:01.740 --> 14:03.740
it's not disguising it anymore,

14:03.740 --> 14:05.740
it's back to the 80s, like 80s was like that,

14:05.740 --> 14:07.740
it was like they would just have a commercial,

14:07.740 --> 14:09.740
it was just like, it was just fucking like crazy,

14:09.740 --> 14:12.740
it was like, yo, you want to get a burger,

14:12.740 --> 14:14.740
get a whopper, a whopper, please,

14:14.740 --> 14:17.740
I want a whopper, whopper with all my cheese.

14:17.740 --> 14:22.740
And it was just black people just biting into burgers,

14:22.740 --> 14:23.740
and they're just like, huh,

14:23.740 --> 14:24.740
and it's just like there's an elephant in the room,

14:24.740 --> 14:27.740
it's just like, hey, your race is different,

14:27.740 --> 14:29.740
but you should buy our product anyway,

14:29.740 --> 14:31.740
and so then I think in the 90s

14:31.740 --> 14:34.740
it got a little more subtle, maybe?

14:34.740 --> 14:38.740
Someone told me about, have you seen this commercial?

14:38.740 --> 14:40.740
I think we must have talked about this commercial

14:40.740 --> 14:42.740
on this podcast, the Coors,

14:42.740 --> 14:44.740
I think it's a Coors-like commercial,

14:44.740 --> 14:46.740
the Silver Bullet people, right?

14:46.740 --> 14:48.740
So there's this commercial,

14:48.740 --> 14:50.740
we had to have talked about this,

14:50.740 --> 14:52.740
the commercial opens up,

14:52.740 --> 14:55.740
this is the 21st century that this commercial is,

14:55.740 --> 14:57.740
there's like courthouse steps,

14:57.740 --> 14:59.740
they're just like a skyscraper steps,

14:59.740 --> 15:04.740
and a multi-ethnic group of young executives comes out,

15:04.740 --> 15:06.740
and they're like, they just finished work

15:06.740 --> 15:09.740
in one suit, and they're like kind of congratulating each other

15:09.740 --> 15:13.740
on a job well done for capitalism that day,

15:13.740 --> 15:16.740
and the Asian lady walks off,

15:16.740 --> 15:19.740
and the white guy goes his way,

15:19.740 --> 15:21.740
and there's probably a Latino guy

15:21.740 --> 15:23.740
although we're lagging there,

15:23.740 --> 15:29.740
but at any rate, we follow the handsome young black executive,

15:29.740 --> 15:32.740
and he goes, and then it goes to a special train station

15:32.740 --> 15:34.740
that he goes to,

15:34.740 --> 15:38.740
and I think it's all black people on the train platform,

15:38.740 --> 15:41.740
and then the Coors-like Silver Bullet train pulls up,

15:41.740 --> 15:45.740
and it opens up, and inside is a crazy black party

15:45.740 --> 15:48.740
on like a Buck Rogers set,

15:48.740 --> 15:51.740
that's like with dry ice and like holograms,

15:51.740 --> 15:53.740
and just all black people just grooving out,

15:53.740 --> 15:55.740
drinking Coors-like, and he gets in it,

15:55.740 --> 15:57.740
and it just goes away, and it's like,

15:57.740 --> 16:00.740
hey, you're black, you have a secret life,

16:00.740 --> 16:02.740
make our beverage a part of it,

16:02.740 --> 16:06.740
like why not?

16:06.740 --> 16:10.740
How do we...

16:10.740 --> 16:12.740
How do we feel about this?

16:12.740 --> 16:14.740
I mean, I guess it's not how do we feel about it,

16:14.740 --> 16:16.740
it's how does the average...

16:16.740 --> 16:18.740
The sales of the commercial is targeted strictly at an audience,

16:18.740 --> 16:20.740
it goes like, yeah, you're a black guy,

16:20.740 --> 16:22.740
it's cool to be a black gal or a guy,

16:22.740 --> 16:26.740
like, you know, cheeseburger, have a Coors-like?

16:26.740 --> 16:27.740
We certainly don't want to live in a world

16:27.740 --> 16:28.740
where anything's against the law,

16:28.740 --> 16:30.740
but we're just talking about like what's...

16:30.740 --> 16:32.740
Could there be a commercial where...

16:32.740 --> 16:33.740
What's respectful?

16:33.740 --> 16:35.740
There should be a commercial where the black guy leaves,

16:35.740 --> 16:37.740
the multi-ethnic capitalist,

16:37.740 --> 16:39.740
goes down a secret train platform,

16:39.740 --> 16:42.740
gets on an all-black dry ice train,

16:42.740 --> 16:44.740
and then a white guy gets on the train,

16:44.740 --> 16:46.740
and everyone's like, oh, shit!

16:46.740 --> 16:48.740
Everyone stops for a second,

16:48.740 --> 16:49.740
and then he holds up a Coors-like,

16:49.740 --> 16:51.740
and they're like, yeah!

16:51.740 --> 16:53.740
Yeah!

16:56.740 --> 16:58.740
Exactly.

16:58.740 --> 17:01.740
I think that...

17:01.740 --> 17:04.740
What's the messaging there?

17:06.740 --> 17:10.740
We know you know about the black secret lifestyle.

17:10.740 --> 17:12.740
Make this beverage part of it.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.740
Yeah, their slogan is, Coors-like.

17:14.740 --> 17:16.740
Is he cool?

17:21.740 --> 17:23.740
The funny thing is that as a TV writer,

17:23.740 --> 17:27.740
the line doesn't seem crystal clear to me,

17:27.740 --> 17:29.740
but it's...

17:29.740 --> 17:32.740
I'm more forgiving of that when it's not an advertising,

17:32.740 --> 17:34.740
I guess because advertising all seems toxic,

17:34.740 --> 17:39.740
so I don't blink at a black sitcom,

17:39.740 --> 17:43.740
like the idea of a nice blue collar,

17:43.740 --> 17:46.740
like, he's a working man, and he's got a family,

17:46.740 --> 17:50.740
and of course you don't have to diversify your all-black cast.

17:50.740 --> 17:53.740
I don't know, I just swallow that all down and go,

17:53.740 --> 17:54.740
well, yeah, what else are we doing?

17:54.740 --> 17:55.740
Who cares? What the fuck?

17:55.740 --> 17:58.740
We try to reflect life and try to cater to an audience.

17:58.740 --> 18:00.740
But when McDonald's does an all-black commercial...

18:00.740 --> 18:02.740
Somehow it just makes me feel...

18:02.740 --> 18:04.740
I guess because all commercials are already,

18:04.740 --> 18:07.740
even just a regular Pringles commercial with a rainbow cast

18:07.740 --> 18:10.740
of people not popping or stopping or whatever they do,

18:10.740 --> 18:12.740
and the librarian saying...

18:12.740 --> 18:15.740
They're popping and not stopping.

18:15.740 --> 18:18.740
No flavor in this library!

18:18.740 --> 18:22.740
Shh! What's going on?

18:22.740 --> 18:27.740
Who's having flavor in the library?

18:29.740 --> 18:33.740
Titties. Glasses off, titties.

18:33.740 --> 18:36.740
Because fuck women, fuck them.

18:39.740 --> 18:42.740
I am so offended by the racial non-homogeneity

18:42.740 --> 18:46.740
in commercials, but hey, if you want to sell me a beer,

18:46.740 --> 18:49.740
put it right between a pair of tits of any color, really,

18:49.740 --> 18:52.740
because I don't see things through that lens.

18:55.740 --> 18:59.740
I'll look at a big, round pair of fake titties of any color.

18:59.740 --> 19:02.740
I'm progressive.

19:06.740 --> 19:08.740
What is going on?

19:08.740 --> 19:10.740
Go on.

19:10.740 --> 19:12.740
What?

19:14.740 --> 19:16.740
I don't know.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.740
When you see an all-black McDonald's commercial,

19:21.740 --> 19:25.740
what is your instinct, what is your reaction to that?

19:25.740 --> 19:28.740
I go, Jesus, that's embarrassing and awkward, that's fucked up.

19:28.740 --> 19:31.740
Do you think a black person thinks that's embarrassing

19:31.740 --> 19:33.740
that they're being pandered to?

19:33.740 --> 19:35.740
I don't know, and I'll tell you what we're not going to do.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.740
We're not going to ask if there's a black person in the audience

19:37.740 --> 19:39.740
and then bring them up and have them speak for all black people.

19:39.740 --> 19:43.740
Because I just don't want to do that to that person.

19:47.740 --> 19:50.740
That person has a right to feel however they feel.

19:50.740 --> 19:52.740
I'm talking about you.

19:52.740 --> 19:56.740
I look at it and I go, we talked about this last week

19:56.740 --> 20:00.740
about how I confessed about my weird white perspective

20:00.740 --> 20:05.740
on these issues that doesn't quite matter and yet matters a lot,

20:05.740 --> 20:08.740
should be reflected upon.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.740
That's how my feelings matter.

20:10.740 --> 20:12.740
It should be me looking at myself and going,

20:12.740 --> 20:14.740
why does this make you feel this way?

20:17.740 --> 20:19.740
The complicated thing is that all of my feelings

20:19.740 --> 20:21.740
have to do with perception of the other.

20:21.740 --> 20:24.740
When I see the commercial come on, I immediately go,

20:24.740 --> 20:27.740
I think my first emotional impulse is,

20:27.740 --> 20:31.740
if I were black, this would make me feel angry.

20:31.740 --> 20:33.740
This would outrage me, yes.

20:33.740 --> 20:36.740
It would make me hate society, yes.

20:36.740 --> 20:38.740
Because I would be going, what do all these people have in common

20:38.740 --> 20:41.740
and why is this corporation telling me,

20:41.740 --> 20:44.740
why is this a hook?

20:44.740 --> 20:46.740
Why are they considering my race to be?

20:46.740 --> 20:51.740
And then simultaneously also saying that my race is necessarily,

20:51.740 --> 20:54.740
of course it's fucking hip hop music.

20:54.740 --> 20:56.740
Of course it's, in the announcer,

20:56.740 --> 20:59.740
he's not an uptight black guy.

20:59.740 --> 21:03.740
They exist, but it's like the voiceover role is like,

21:03.740 --> 21:06.740
I don't know, the fucking voiceover guy in the McDonald's commercial is like,

21:06.740 --> 21:08.740
hey, you know what time it is.

21:08.740 --> 21:14.740
It's like, it's always get that oozing with fucking nighttime DJ sexuality.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.740
I don't know, on one hand it would be like,

21:17.740 --> 21:19.740
Maybe the commercial is not targeted towards black people,

21:19.740 --> 21:21.740
but to white people, like, oh shit.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.740
That's actually a really good point,

21:23.740 --> 21:25.740
because they're all very attractive black people.

21:25.740 --> 21:27.740
Maybe the white person that's behind you is like, fuck society,

21:27.740 --> 21:29.740
I'm gonna do it, black people too.

21:29.740 --> 21:33.740
I'm so angry at white corporate America,

21:33.740 --> 21:35.740
I'm gonna go eat a fucking Big Mac

21:35.740 --> 21:39.740
with my thin little white lips, nibble nibble nibble nibble nibble.

21:41.740 --> 21:43.740
Look at me, Ray Kroc.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.740
Are you angry at White House?

21:50.740 --> 21:52.740
Mmm, chicken McNuggets.

21:52.740 --> 21:57.740
Anyways.

21:57.740 --> 21:59.740
But there is another part of me that I said,

21:59.740 --> 22:02.740
like I said, because it's not like,

22:02.740 --> 22:05.740
it's not negative stereotypes in the commercial,

22:05.740 --> 22:09.740
it's you're fun, you're sexy, you're having a good time.

22:09.740 --> 22:10.740
I don't know, it's weird.

22:10.740 --> 22:12.740
I don't think anyone likes being defined.

22:12.740 --> 22:14.740
I think if they had a commercial that said,

22:14.740 --> 22:17.740
like, hey, you're blonde, come to McDonald's,

22:17.740 --> 22:19.740
like, blondes have a good time,

22:19.740 --> 22:22.740
like, you know how blondes are.

22:22.740 --> 22:23.740
After work with my blonde friends,

22:23.740 --> 22:27.740
I'm in the mood for one thing, chicken McNuggets.

22:27.740 --> 22:30.740
But so many commercials are all white people.

22:30.740 --> 22:33.740
You don't feel that that's insulting to white people?

22:33.740 --> 22:36.740
It's unanimously white people in a commercial?

22:36.740 --> 22:38.740
I don't think you can insult white people.

22:40.740 --> 22:43.740
I don't know how to do that, except to call them racists.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.740
Mario at the drying room, I'm giving him credit for that joke.

22:48.740 --> 22:51.740
He said, because we were talking about race,

22:51.740 --> 22:53.740
because I was in there.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.740
And Mario, if you ever go to the drying room,

22:56.740 --> 22:58.740
is that big guy Mario behind the bar.

22:58.740 --> 22:59.740
He's Cuban, yeah.

22:59.740 --> 23:01.740
And he goes, you know what they say about white people, Dan?

23:01.740 --> 23:05.740
I said, no, he's like, you can call them honky, cracker,

23:05.740 --> 23:08.740
peckerwood, just don't call them racist.

23:09.740 --> 23:12.740
I was like, you're right, that's the only thing that offensive.

23:12.740 --> 23:14.740
They get all Brent out of shape.

23:14.740 --> 23:18.740
I'd love to be called peckerwood, that would be amazing.

23:19.740 --> 23:21.740
It would make me feel struggle.

23:22.740 --> 23:24.740
Yeah, I am a peckerwood.

23:26.740 --> 23:28.740
Are you afraid?

23:32.740 --> 23:34.740
Of my wooden pecker?

23:36.740 --> 23:37.740
You should be.

23:37.740 --> 23:44.740
I will mortgage your house and then lie about it,

23:44.740 --> 23:49.740
and foreclose, because I am manipulative and racist,

23:49.740 --> 23:51.740
and I'm a peckerwood.

23:52.740 --> 23:53.740
Careful.

23:53.740 --> 24:02.740
What's the McDonald's commercial targeted just towards peckerwood?

24:09.740 --> 24:13.740
That knife holds hard because it curves to the left.

24:17.740 --> 24:20.740
So you pick your three wood and you hold your breath

24:20.740 --> 24:24.740
and you swing for the clouds, but you know that your stomach is empty.

24:31.740 --> 24:34.740
I can't believe they got Bob Seeger to that commercial.

24:37.740 --> 24:41.740
Hey, tomorrow's Wednesday, and as all white people know,

24:41.740 --> 24:43.740
it's secret, no work day.

24:43.740 --> 24:48.740
So come to McDonald's, there won't be any black people there.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.740
And that commercial, what if one black guy walks in on that day?

24:54.740 --> 24:56.740
And then he holds up with McNugget and we're like,

24:56.740 --> 24:57.740
Get in here!

24:57.740 --> 25:10.740
All right, so speaking of outrage,

25:10.740 --> 25:17.740
so I'm playing Arkham Knight on the Xbox,

25:17.740 --> 25:22.740
and after that, so I've played all three of the Arkham games

25:22.740 --> 25:26.740
and then realizing like, holy shit, Alfred as always is helping a lot.

25:26.740 --> 25:28.740
He helps a lot, Alfred.

25:28.740 --> 25:30.740
Like, he's the point man.

25:30.740 --> 25:31.740
He's like, you know, he's like,

25:31.740 --> 25:33.740
So you should know that those fingerprints belong to the so-and-so.

25:33.740 --> 25:37.740
Like, he's working a full-time job, like running prints

25:37.740 --> 25:39.740
and going through crime databases and stuff.

25:39.740 --> 25:42.740
And it's just like, and he does that in the movies too,

25:42.740 --> 25:43.740
so it's not just the video game,

25:43.740 --> 25:45.740
but it's like, it finally just occurred to me

25:45.740 --> 25:47.740
because I was playing Batman and once again Alfred is like,

25:47.740 --> 25:49.740
Should I send the new Batsuit, sir?

25:49.740 --> 25:50.740
Like, thank you.

25:50.740 --> 25:53.740
And he's like, you'll notice the Kevlar plating is a little bit of a tweak.

25:53.740 --> 25:55.740
And I'm like, yeah, thanks.

25:55.740 --> 25:58.740
And then I'm like, okay, will there be anything else, sir?

25:58.740 --> 26:01.740
And then I was like, yeah, oh, well, the sink is filling with dishes.

26:01.740 --> 26:07.740
Like, you're, you are a fucking butler.

26:07.740 --> 26:11.740
We can't hire anymore help because every time you touch a goddamn Shakespeare head,

26:11.740 --> 26:18.740
the fucking bookcase turns into a scuba vehicle.

26:18.740 --> 26:21.740
So we can't, I guess at me and this 900 room house with one guy,

26:21.740 --> 26:25.740
I just think like Alfred like must be pretty pissed off.

26:25.740 --> 26:27.740
Like talk about a guy with, you know,

26:27.740 --> 26:32.740
that like you must spend his nights like punching walls because,

26:32.740 --> 26:34.740
because Batman comes home and goes like, thank you.

26:34.740 --> 26:38.740
And then Alfred's like, okay, well, he probably every night goes like,

26:38.740 --> 26:41.740
like sends these big hints like, well, if there's nothing else,

26:41.740 --> 26:44.740
then I guess I should, you know, while this was all going on,

26:44.740 --> 26:47.740
while I was coming up with that antidote for the neurotoxin,

26:47.740 --> 26:50.740
I did like, I forgot to sweep up the pantry.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.740
So I guess I'll go do that.

26:52.740 --> 27:00.740
And then Bruce Wayne's like, okay, cool.

27:00.740 --> 27:01.740
He's his butler for real.

27:01.740 --> 27:03.740
It's not like a fake like thing.

27:03.740 --> 27:06.740
Like, like he's, his boss is a guy who pretends to be a bat,

27:06.740 --> 27:10.740
but he can't, he can't even be a fake butler.

27:10.740 --> 27:11.740
He's not even allowed.

27:11.740 --> 27:13.740
So do you think maybe I could have an alter ego?

27:13.740 --> 27:16.740
Maybe by day, I'm not a fucking butler.

27:16.740 --> 27:17.740
It's crazy.

27:17.740 --> 27:21.740
White people have it hard.

27:21.740 --> 27:24.740
Not on Wednesday.

27:24.740 --> 27:29.740
You've been polishing Bruce Wayne's candelabra

27:29.740 --> 27:31.740
and helping him fight poison ivy,

27:31.740 --> 27:34.740
but your lips are smacking for that salty taste

27:34.740 --> 27:43.740
of a deep fried string of processed potato-like substance.

27:43.740 --> 27:47.740
All right, well, is it, hey, is, is, is Curtis here yet?

27:47.740 --> 27:48.740
No.

27:48.740 --> 27:50.740
Okay, the fucking guy telling you.

27:50.740 --> 27:51.740
Stay nice.

27:51.740 --> 27:53.740
Stayin' fucking nice.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.740
You know we have no show other than that.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.740
Spencer, how's it going?

27:56.740 --> 27:59.740
Hey guys, I'm, I'm doing just good.

27:59.740 --> 28:04.740
Let's, uh, oh, so someone, I'd assume a fan of Harmontown

28:04.740 --> 28:07.740
sent me a Super Nintendo game, I think,

28:07.740 --> 28:09.740
anonymously, it was Mega Man X3.

28:09.740 --> 28:12.740
It's worth, like, a lot of money.

28:12.740 --> 28:15.740
So, I should've mentioned it weeks and weeks ago,

28:15.740 --> 28:17.740
but thank you very much.

28:17.740 --> 28:19.740
Sorry, sorry everybody.

28:19.740 --> 28:20.740
Now, now to today.

28:20.740 --> 28:23.740
I was driving by a place called Kabob Time,

28:23.740 --> 28:27.740
and it's all, I guess already you know the marketing's not

28:27.740 --> 28:29.740
very strong at this location,

28:29.740 --> 28:33.740
but Kabob Time had assigned a subtitle, if you will,

28:33.740 --> 28:36.740
for the restaurant, which I don't know if that's common.

28:36.740 --> 28:38.740
I guess that's kind of common for restaurants,

28:38.740 --> 28:42.740
but he said, no heartburn, exclamation point,

28:42.740 --> 28:46.740
which is very interesting tactic for advertising.

28:46.740 --> 28:48.740
It's like you don't see that elsewhere,

28:48.740 --> 28:52.740
like Denny's not poison, or like...

28:52.740 --> 28:53.740
It's also totally irresponsible.

28:53.740 --> 28:54.740
They can't say that.

28:54.740 --> 28:57.740
Yeah, that's completely down to your own constitution.

28:57.740 --> 28:58.740
Like...

28:58.740 --> 28:59.740
That's like that yelp doctor saying,

28:59.740 --> 29:01.740
you definitely have A.G.D.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.740
Well, yeah, I mean, I guess it would be like

29:03.740 --> 29:06.740
if they were like no cancer or like something,

29:06.740 --> 29:09.740
you can't determine these things.

29:09.740 --> 29:11.740
Cancer's not a good place to go.

29:11.740 --> 29:12.740
Found that out.

29:12.740 --> 29:15.740
Hey, I have a new segment.

29:18.740 --> 29:20.740
Do you?

29:23.740 --> 29:27.740
Dan, if you don't have a segment, don't lie about it.

29:27.740 --> 29:29.740
It's called Uber Confessions.

29:29.740 --> 29:32.740
Uber Confessions!

29:32.740 --> 29:37.740
Sometimes you're in a car, but you don't want to drive

29:37.740 --> 29:39.740
because it's too far, or you're too drunk

29:39.740 --> 29:41.740
so you have someone else drive you.

29:41.740 --> 29:43.740
And they're Armenian.

29:50.740 --> 29:52.740
My first Uber Confession...

29:52.740 --> 29:54.740
I have two Uber Confessions tonight.

29:54.740 --> 29:57.740
My first Uber Confession is that every time

29:57.740 --> 30:01.740
someone drops me off at my house and says,

30:01.740 --> 30:04.740
you have a beautiful home, my first reaction?

30:04.740 --> 30:06.740
Panic.

30:06.740 --> 30:08.740
That's my first confession.

30:08.740 --> 30:11.740
Value my candor, don't punish me for it.

30:16.740 --> 30:20.740
My second Uber Confession is that I just finally realized

30:20.740 --> 30:22.740
I was looking down at the bottom tabs.

30:22.740 --> 30:25.740
I've been using an American Express card

30:25.740 --> 30:29.740
to call Ubers since I decided to not buy a car,

30:29.740 --> 30:31.740
which was a long time ago,

30:31.740 --> 30:34.740
and I have been fucking flat.

30:34.740 --> 30:38.740
There's a little tab down there with the American Express card,

30:38.740 --> 30:41.740
and it says, pay with this card,

30:41.740 --> 30:43.740
and then I notice another tab next to it that says,

30:43.740 --> 30:44.740
use points.

30:44.740 --> 30:46.740
I'm like, use points.

30:46.740 --> 30:48.740
I click on it.

30:48.740 --> 30:54.740
I have 1.07 million membership rewards points,

30:54.740 --> 31:00.740
which translates to $10,766 worth of Uber rides.

31:02.740 --> 31:06.740
Which means I haven't done the math,

31:06.740 --> 31:09.740
but I can never get a car.

31:09.740 --> 31:11.740
Because of all the money I've clearly blown on Uber,

31:11.740 --> 31:13.740
it now means I'll be blowing even more money

31:13.740 --> 31:15.740
if I don't use all these points.

31:15.740 --> 31:18.740
And those are my Uber Confessions.

31:18.740 --> 31:25.740
Yo, it smells like cologne in here.

31:25.740 --> 31:26.740
Is there a button?

31:26.740 --> 31:28.740
A no cologne button on the app, please?

31:28.740 --> 31:30.740
A no cologne button.

31:30.740 --> 31:33.740
Oh, now it smells like cigarettes.

31:35.740 --> 31:38.740
A no cologne button, that would be good, right, buddy?

31:38.740 --> 31:41.740
Like, park your car with a valet,

31:41.740 --> 31:43.740
and you get in your car,

31:43.740 --> 31:45.740
and the valet guy gets out,

31:45.740 --> 31:47.740
and my car smells like your cologne

31:47.740 --> 31:49.740
for the rest of time.

31:49.740 --> 31:52.740
That's an occupation where you should not be allowed

31:52.740 --> 31:55.740
to wear all the cologne.

31:55.740 --> 31:57.740
It's unregulated, man.

31:57.740 --> 31:59.740
A flight attendant should not be able

31:59.740 --> 32:01.740
to wear all the perfume or cologne.

32:01.740 --> 32:03.740
I was in a southwest flight where a woman

32:03.740 --> 32:06.740
had so much cologne, I moved to the back of the plane

32:06.740 --> 32:08.740
because I couldn't breathe,

32:08.740 --> 32:11.740
and I called the FAA and had her killed.

32:13.740 --> 32:16.740
Which I thought was too far.

32:16.740 --> 32:18.740
Well, at least you're...

32:18.740 --> 32:20.740
I did regret it.

32:20.740 --> 32:22.740
Also, I lost my voice today

32:22.740 --> 32:24.740
cheering for a U.S. women's soccer team.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.740
So, speaking of feminism,

32:35.740 --> 32:37.740
Aaron hired a guy to clean out our garage today

32:37.740 --> 32:39.740
because there's like a lot of...

32:39.740 --> 32:41.740
That is feminist.

32:42.740 --> 32:44.740
There's a lot of like...

32:44.740 --> 32:48.740
The glorious denim of hiring people.

32:49.740 --> 32:52.740
The garage of my home is like...

32:52.740 --> 32:55.740
The back and side walls are all dirt,

32:55.740 --> 32:57.740
as high as the garage's roof.

32:57.740 --> 33:00.740
It's kind of like an underground garage.

33:00.740 --> 33:03.740
Years and years, the house was built in 1929,

33:03.740 --> 33:06.740
humble brag, not a humble brag, just a brag.

33:09.740 --> 33:12.740
All the water has just been slowly seeping

33:12.740 --> 33:14.740
into the walls of the garage,

33:14.740 --> 33:16.740
and the things are ready to fall apart.

33:16.740 --> 33:18.740
But I had so... Spencer helped me hire

33:18.740 --> 33:20.740
these landscaper guys,

33:20.740 --> 33:22.740
like dig these trenches and these steel...

33:22.740 --> 33:24.740
Anyway, that's not really important to the story.

33:24.740 --> 33:26.740
I think it is.

33:26.740 --> 33:28.740
We got the garage, which always...

33:28.740 --> 33:30.740
If you went in there and took a whiff,

33:30.740 --> 33:33.740
you'd be like, I'm certainly going to die of black mold.

33:33.740 --> 33:35.740
Like, oh, by the way!

33:35.740 --> 33:37.740
Wait!

33:38.740 --> 33:40.740
Everybody get out.

33:40.740 --> 33:42.740
If they can come back in,

33:42.740 --> 33:44.740
we're going to start the show over.

33:44.740 --> 33:46.740
What was her name, the poor young lady,

33:46.740 --> 33:48.740
the actress that she...

33:48.740 --> 33:50.740
Brittany Murphy.

33:50.740 --> 33:51.740
Do you guys read about that?

33:51.740 --> 33:52.740
It wasn't as publicized.

33:52.740 --> 33:53.740
I keep spitting on you, Willie.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.740
You're in the splash zone, sorry.

33:55.740 --> 33:57.740
It's just vodka for my mustache.

33:57.740 --> 33:59.740
Like, I took a bath today.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.740
Epsom salts and vodka.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.740
And just a little bit of a...

34:04.740 --> 34:05.740
Key and P...

34:05.740 --> 34:07.740
Fraud complex.

34:07.740 --> 34:09.740
Just a hint.

34:09.740 --> 34:11.740
The...

34:11.740 --> 34:13.740
Everybody kind of characterized...

34:13.740 --> 34:15.740
Oh, she died and was kind of characterized

34:15.740 --> 34:17.740
as drug overdose and stuff.

34:17.740 --> 34:19.740
Her husband died.

34:19.740 --> 34:21.740
They had black mold in their shower.

34:23.740 --> 34:25.740
They died of the same thing.

34:25.740 --> 34:27.740
And because they...

34:27.740 --> 34:29.740
I mean, fucking horrible.

34:29.740 --> 34:31.740
And terrifying.

34:31.740 --> 34:33.740
There's nothing good about that.

34:33.740 --> 34:35.740
There's no silver. Try to find the silver lining of that one.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.740
What's really terrifying is the symptoms

34:37.740 --> 34:39.740
of mold poisoning

34:39.740 --> 34:41.740
can lead from, like, anything

34:41.740 --> 34:43.740
from, like, headaches to stuffy nose

34:43.740 --> 34:45.740
to, like, bleeding eye sockets

34:45.740 --> 34:46.740
and then death.

34:46.740 --> 34:48.740
And so it's like, oh, I have a headache.

34:48.740 --> 34:49.740
Oh, I'm dead.

34:49.740 --> 34:50.740
Like...

34:50.740 --> 34:52.740
Like, just normal maladies.

34:52.740 --> 34:54.740
And you go out knowing

34:54.740 --> 34:56.740
that if you're me, for instance,

34:56.740 --> 34:59.740
that everyone's gonna go, oh, he was an alcoholic.

34:59.740 --> 35:01.740
Like, that's what killed him.

35:01.740 --> 35:03.740
And I'm like, no, Mike, that's...

35:03.740 --> 35:05.740
You guarantee I will haunt your asses.

35:05.740 --> 35:07.740
And I'll be, like, pointing at the black mold.

35:07.740 --> 35:09.740
And everyone will be like, oh, it's Dan Harmon.

35:09.740 --> 35:10.740
He's...

35:10.740 --> 35:11.740
He's...

35:11.740 --> 35:13.740
There must be gold buried over there.

35:15.740 --> 35:17.740
No, it's black mold.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.740
It's not gold.

35:21.740 --> 35:23.740
You can only hear tea.

35:23.740 --> 35:25.740
Texas, there's oil in the back.

35:25.740 --> 35:27.740
That's why ghosts are so misunderstood.

35:27.740 --> 35:29.740
You can only hear their vowels.

35:29.740 --> 35:31.740
They're not saying boo, they're saying...

35:31.740 --> 35:33.740
They're saying drew.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.740
They're saying drew.

35:35.740 --> 35:37.740
They're saying drew.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.740
They're saying chew.

35:43.740 --> 35:45.740
They don't want you to choke like they did.

35:47.740 --> 35:49.740
20 times, it seems excessive, but...

35:55.740 --> 35:57.740
The ghost is just murmuring at me.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.740
All right, black mold.

36:01.740 --> 36:03.740
So, yeah, so you would go in my garage

36:03.740 --> 36:05.740
and be like, oh, God, this is a death trap.

36:07.740 --> 36:09.740
So we sealed it off on the outside.

36:09.740 --> 36:11.740
Big, expensive landscaping job.

36:11.740 --> 36:13.740
And then because we did that now,

36:13.740 --> 36:15.740
today, Aaron hired a task rabbit,

36:15.740 --> 36:17.740
I'm familiar with this,

36:17.740 --> 36:19.740
to come and, like, help clean out the garage.

36:19.740 --> 36:21.740
So he goes up, so there's a bunch of stuff

36:21.740 --> 36:23.740
in the storage there, big cardboard boxes

36:23.740 --> 36:25.740
full of stuff that we've put into cold storage up there.

36:27.740 --> 36:29.740
All water damage, because of the water it's seeping through.

36:29.740 --> 36:31.740
So I wasn't down there,

36:31.740 --> 36:33.740
Aaron came up and reported this to me,

36:33.740 --> 36:35.740
that the guy reached up, touched the first box

36:35.740 --> 36:37.740
on the top left, and it disintegrated in his hands

36:37.740 --> 36:41.740
and a thousand porn magazines just...

36:43.740 --> 36:47.740
flooded, like, Stanley Kubrick's blood elevator, just...

36:49.740 --> 36:51.740
just nothing but, like, 10 years

36:51.740 --> 36:55.740
of pre-internet obsessive-compulsive hoarding of porn.

36:55.740 --> 36:57.740
Yup.

36:57.740 --> 36:59.740
I was trying to explain to Aaron,

36:59.740 --> 37:01.740
I was like, you don't understand,

37:01.740 --> 37:03.740
she's 12 years younger than me,

37:03.740 --> 37:05.740
I'm like, before the internet,

37:05.740 --> 37:09.740
you never knew if you were going to see this lady again.

37:11.740 --> 37:13.740
And she's like, then why buy more?

37:13.740 --> 37:15.740
And I'm like, well, because you're done,

37:15.740 --> 37:17.740
and then you need more.

37:19.740 --> 37:21.740
Why put it in a box?

37:21.740 --> 37:23.740
Because I put it in a box before the internet.

37:23.740 --> 37:25.740
And the funny thing is,

37:25.740 --> 37:27.740
I realized, like, yeah,

37:27.740 --> 37:29.740
because then remember, guys my age,

37:29.740 --> 37:31.740
like, when you first started,

37:31.740 --> 37:33.740
like, really, we all had, like, a folder,

37:33.740 --> 37:35.740
you know, somewhere hidden away,

37:35.740 --> 37:37.740
where it was like the same instinct,

37:37.740 --> 37:39.740
it was like, you got to hoard this porn,

37:39.740 --> 37:41.740
but it's everywhere, and it's like,

37:41.740 --> 37:43.740
do you realize the reason that folder is so full

37:43.740 --> 37:45.740
is because the porn will never end

37:45.740 --> 37:47.740
and you don't need it?

37:47.740 --> 37:49.740
And now, finally, I've caught up with the rest of the world,

37:49.740 --> 37:51.740
we're all like, we're just awash in porn,

37:51.740 --> 37:53.740
like, why would you ever save anything?

37:53.740 --> 37:55.740
No, why do you still have those boxes?

37:55.740 --> 37:57.740
Why not, like, throw those out?

37:57.740 --> 37:59.740
Because not only were those boxes filled

37:59.740 --> 38:01.740
long ago, they were also, like,

38:01.740 --> 38:03.740
packed away long ago, so there were just boxes that were,

38:03.740 --> 38:05.740
those boxes were,

38:05.740 --> 38:07.740
those boxes were still sealed,

38:07.740 --> 38:09.740
you know, before I moved into that house,

38:09.740 --> 38:11.740
and then it just, just take the boxes with you.

38:11.740 --> 38:13.740
You had a folder, like a little,

38:13.740 --> 38:15.740
like, manila folder,

38:15.740 --> 38:17.740
that was pieces of porn that you had torn out.

38:17.740 --> 38:19.740
Yeah, because I would try to console,

38:19.740 --> 38:21.740
like, okay, it's like,

38:21.740 --> 38:23.740
it's like archiving your hard drive

38:23.740 --> 38:25.740
or, like, compressing it, like a zip file.

38:25.740 --> 38:27.740
Like, okay, well, what's really,

38:27.740 --> 38:29.740
well, let's get all the redheads out of here and,

38:29.740 --> 38:31.740
like, it's becoming,

38:31.740 --> 38:33.740
it's becoming a space problem,

38:33.740 --> 38:35.740
it's becoming an actual physical space problem.

38:35.740 --> 38:37.740
You had a closet that was, like,

38:37.740 --> 38:39.740
floor to ceiling, just playboys

38:39.740 --> 38:41.740
and stuff, but you had this one,

38:41.740 --> 38:43.740
like, pretty full manila folder,

38:43.740 --> 38:45.740
so I was leafing through it,

38:45.740 --> 38:47.740
I'm like, wow, you were like redheads,

38:47.740 --> 38:49.740
like, what?

38:49.740 --> 38:51.740
You were like, oh, fuck, I do.

38:51.740 --> 38:53.740
Yeah.

38:53.740 --> 38:55.740
I just went with my guy,

38:55.740 --> 38:57.740
and they're all redheads.

38:57.740 --> 38:59.740
It's, you know, it's face blindness,

38:59.740 --> 39:01.740
you go like, oh, their hair is, I noticed that.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.740
I go by hair and eyebrows.

39:03.740 --> 39:05.740
I didn't know there was Dave Kline,

39:05.740 --> 39:07.740
we were arguing, so he was on the camera,

39:07.740 --> 39:09.740
is that Dave Kline, you know,

39:09.740 --> 39:11.740
or any guy with blonde hair and a beard?

39:11.740 --> 39:13.740
Because it could be anybody.

39:13.740 --> 39:15.740
And if Dave Kline had dark hair,

39:15.740 --> 39:17.740
if he had red hair,

39:17.740 --> 39:19.740
he'd be in your folder.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.740
Pleaded skirt.

39:29.740 --> 39:31.740
Like, let's give him a little something.

39:31.740 --> 39:33.740
The,

39:33.740 --> 39:35.740
I was watching True Detective

39:35.740 --> 39:37.740
and Colin Farrell has a mustache,

39:37.740 --> 39:39.740
and then there's that one flashback

39:39.740 --> 39:41.740
where he meets Vince Vaughn

39:41.740 --> 39:43.740
and he doesn't have a mustache,

39:43.740 --> 39:45.740
and he doesn't have a mustache now.

39:45.740 --> 39:47.740
Oh, it's Colin Farrell,

39:47.740 --> 39:49.740
just without one thing above his lip,

39:49.740 --> 39:51.740
and I'm just like, static.

39:51.740 --> 39:53.740
Because he doesn't have, I need,

39:53.740 --> 39:55.740
all my friends look weird.

39:55.740 --> 39:57.740
Like, Jeff, where's those suits for a reason?

39:57.740 --> 39:59.740
Like, I go by props,

39:59.740 --> 40:01.740
I need you to have like a hat,

40:01.740 --> 40:03.740
or like a monocle, or like crazy thick eyebrows.

40:03.740 --> 40:05.740
Are you saying that I wear suits

40:05.740 --> 40:07.740
so that you recognize me?

40:07.740 --> 40:09.740
Yeah, yeah.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.740
I think you unconsciously know that you will,

40:11.740 --> 40:13.740
I always thought you were a narcissist,

40:13.740 --> 40:15.740
but that's too far.

40:15.740 --> 40:17.740
That's too fucking far.

40:17.740 --> 40:19.740
I'll prove I'm not a narcissist

40:19.740 --> 40:21.740
by taking a backseat

40:21.740 --> 40:23.740
to our guest, Curtis Armstrong.

40:25.740 --> 40:27.740
I saw it.

40:37.740 --> 40:39.740
Also Dan, before we say hi to Curtis,

40:39.740 --> 40:41.740
I want to say thank you

40:41.740 --> 40:43.740
for that great feminist tale you told us.

40:45.740 --> 40:47.740
Speaking of feminism,

40:47.740 --> 40:49.740
I have a lot of porn in my garage.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.740
You're really on top of my,

40:53.740 --> 40:55.740
are you like my jokes agent?

40:55.740 --> 40:57.740
Hey, look at this joke!

40:57.740 --> 40:59.740
I said women's soccer,

40:59.740 --> 41:01.740
you said speaking of feminism,

41:01.740 --> 41:03.740
you told a story about having a lot of porn magazines.

41:03.740 --> 41:05.740
Yeah, funny.

41:05.740 --> 41:07.740
Funny.

41:07.740 --> 41:09.740
Because it's not feminism.

41:09.740 --> 41:11.740
Oh, okay.

41:13.740 --> 41:15.740
Yeah.

41:15.740 --> 41:17.740
Jeff loses his sense of irony

41:17.740 --> 41:19.740
when he drinks a little bit.

41:19.740 --> 41:21.740
Remember when he was so angry about chain zingers?

41:25.740 --> 41:27.740
Still am, still am, Dan.

41:27.740 --> 41:29.740
I'm too drunk to even talk about it right now.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.740
Sorry, Curtis.

41:33.740 --> 41:35.740
That's a rude way to bring out a guest.

41:35.740 --> 41:37.740
No, it's a fine way. I'm used to it.

41:39.740 --> 41:41.740
I was also thinking,

41:41.740 --> 41:43.740
because of porn in your garage,

41:43.740 --> 41:45.740
because I kept

41:45.740 --> 41:47.740
porn in my garage at one point.

41:47.740 --> 41:49.740
Did you ever have that conversation with your wife?

41:49.740 --> 41:51.740
I did, actually.

41:51.740 --> 41:53.740
But the thing that people don't realize,

41:53.740 --> 41:55.740
especially if you're with someone

41:55.740 --> 41:57.740
who's a lot younger than you,

41:57.740 --> 41:59.740
is that it used to be difficult

41:59.740 --> 42:01.740
to get porn.

42:01.740 --> 42:03.740
You had to go into a store

42:03.740 --> 42:05.740
and face a person.

42:05.740 --> 42:07.740
And sometimes it was a young woman

42:07.740 --> 42:09.740
like your own age

42:09.740 --> 42:11.740
who was working in the store

42:11.740 --> 42:13.740
and you had to buy your porn

42:13.740 --> 42:15.740
and actually look at someone

42:15.740 --> 42:17.740
as opposed to doing it in the privacy of your room.

42:17.740 --> 42:19.740
I never saw that.

42:19.740 --> 42:21.740
I did.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.740
My guy was always like a really horrible...

42:23.740 --> 42:25.740
Like a Vietnam event with a cigar in his ear.

42:25.740 --> 42:27.740
I always thought they kind of

42:27.740 --> 42:29.740
profiled for those jobs

42:29.740 --> 42:31.740
because I always dreamed of that.

42:31.740 --> 42:33.740
But it never worked out that way.

42:33.740 --> 42:35.740
It was like there was always the guy

42:35.740 --> 42:37.740
with the bad, horrible face

42:37.740 --> 42:39.740
and the drool who was there most of the time.

42:39.740 --> 42:41.740
And then when I would go in

42:41.740 --> 42:43.740
to get my penthouse,

42:43.740 --> 42:45.740
it would be somebody like a 19-year-old woman.

42:45.740 --> 42:47.740
That's just bad business

42:47.740 --> 42:49.740
at an adult bookstore.

42:49.740 --> 42:51.740
Oh, I never went to adult bookstores.

42:51.740 --> 42:53.740
I would only go to regular

42:53.740 --> 42:55.740
bookstores that had the section

42:55.740 --> 42:57.740
in the back where everything was covered up.

42:57.740 --> 42:59.740
I think you grew up in a bigger city than me.

42:59.740 --> 43:01.740
That's possible.

43:01.740 --> 43:03.740
That's something that can sustain that in their economy.

43:03.740 --> 43:05.740
But I kept them for years.

43:05.740 --> 43:07.740
I found them constantly...

43:11.740 --> 43:13.740
After a while, I didn't want to go out

43:13.740 --> 43:15.740
and buy them anymore, so I just

43:15.740 --> 43:17.740
used the same ones over and over again.

43:17.740 --> 43:19.740
Right, you can use them.

43:19.740 --> 43:21.740
Someone should study this.

43:21.740 --> 43:23.740
And no one ever will now because we're now in this digital age.

43:23.740 --> 43:25.740
It's sort of...

43:25.740 --> 43:27.740
This is anthropology we're talking about now.

43:27.740 --> 43:29.740
But there's some kind of useful data there

43:29.740 --> 43:31.740
about the human mind, the male mind,

43:31.740 --> 43:33.740
the sex driver, something in the visual

43:33.740 --> 43:35.740
relationship with it, because

43:35.740 --> 43:37.740
to study how big does the pile

43:37.740 --> 43:39.740
have to be, assuming

43:39.740 --> 43:41.740
one wank a day...

43:41.740 --> 43:43.740
One?

43:43.740 --> 43:45.740
As if.

43:45.740 --> 43:47.740
I'm just making simple numbers.

43:47.740 --> 43:49.740
Okay.

43:49.740 --> 43:51.740
As I was jerking off in St. Ives,

43:51.740 --> 43:53.740
I met a man with seven brides.

43:53.740 --> 43:55.740
The...

43:55.740 --> 43:57.740
I don't want to get into that situation.

43:57.740 --> 43:59.740
See, how tall does the pile

43:59.740 --> 44:01.740
have to be, the theoretical pile

44:01.740 --> 44:03.740
before the stuff on the bottom

44:03.740 --> 44:05.740
becomes new again

44:05.740 --> 44:07.740
for a guy?

44:07.740 --> 44:09.740
That's a good question.

44:09.740 --> 44:11.740
Because that phenomenon would happen...

44:11.740 --> 44:13.740
There were times when I would think,

44:13.740 --> 44:15.740
why are you doing this? You're a hoarder.

44:15.740 --> 44:17.740
You're a weird hoarder

44:17.740 --> 44:19.740
and an addict,

44:19.740 --> 44:21.740
and you're keeping this stuff

44:21.740 --> 44:23.740
some strange, but then

44:23.740 --> 44:25.740
sure enough, at some point, the hoarder's

44:25.740 --> 44:27.740
worst nightmare is

44:27.740 --> 44:29.740
like, oh my god, what if I need that ball of string

44:29.740 --> 44:31.740
or something, and you're like, oh my god, what was that?

44:31.740 --> 44:33.740
What was that one?

44:33.740 --> 44:35.740
What did that lady look like? She was playing the pinball machine.

44:35.740 --> 44:37.740
She had the cobra boots

44:37.740 --> 44:39.740
and then if you can't

44:39.740 --> 44:41.740
find it, it's like a panic.

44:41.740 --> 44:43.740
You're like, Margaret!

44:43.740 --> 44:45.740
Yeah.

44:45.740 --> 44:47.740
And what I found was that they were usually,

44:47.740 --> 44:49.740
the ones that I had were

44:49.740 --> 44:51.740
generic enough

44:51.740 --> 44:53.740
that I would have to make up whole stories.

44:53.740 --> 44:55.740
So

44:55.740 --> 44:57.740
after, I didn't need that big of a pile

44:57.740 --> 44:59.740
because it was actually a great

44:59.740 --> 45:01.740
exercise

45:01.740 --> 45:03.740
in storytelling

45:03.740 --> 45:05.740
basically that

45:05.740 --> 45:07.740
after a while

45:07.740 --> 45:09.740
I'd go back to the other ones and then

45:09.740 --> 45:11.740
it would be a whole new story. She'd be French now.

45:13.740 --> 45:15.740
I'd met her on a train.

45:15.740 --> 45:17.740
And now it's just a big free-for-all.

45:17.740 --> 45:19.740
I know. Now it's so easy.

45:19.740 --> 45:21.740
You kids today, you don't know how good you got it.

45:21.740 --> 45:23.740
I used to jerk off uphill both ways to school.

45:23.740 --> 45:25.740
That's right.

45:27.740 --> 45:29.740
You had to work for it back then.

45:29.740 --> 45:31.740
You had to hunt and gather.

45:31.740 --> 45:33.740
That's right.

45:33.740 --> 45:35.740
I wonder

45:35.740 --> 45:37.740
about the female side of it

45:37.740 --> 45:39.740
because there's the myth that women aren't

45:39.740 --> 45:41.740
visually stimulated. There's the myth that women

45:41.740 --> 45:43.740
I'd be willing to bet

45:43.740 --> 45:45.740
but I'm also very willing

45:45.740 --> 45:47.740
to be wrong about this. I'd be willing to bet

45:47.740 --> 45:49.740
there's probably a huge difference in the amount

45:49.740 --> 45:51.740
of

45:51.740 --> 45:53.740
porn that women consume, etc.

45:53.740 --> 45:55.740
But I've had enough conversations

45:55.740 --> 45:57.740
with enough confessional women

45:57.740 --> 45:59.740
to know that

45:59.740 --> 46:01.740
there's a myth that they don't

46:01.740 --> 46:03.740
fart and they never watch porn.

46:03.740 --> 46:05.740
They do both.

46:05.740 --> 46:07.740
They usually at the same time.

46:07.740 --> 46:09.740
That's a stereotype

46:09.740 --> 46:11.740
that does hold up. It turns them on for some reason.

46:11.740 --> 46:13.740
That's why they don't like

46:13.740 --> 46:15.740
women fart because

46:15.740 --> 46:17.740
they think farts are really sexy

46:17.740 --> 46:19.740
but only when they do it

46:19.740 --> 46:21.740
themselves and they don't want

46:21.740 --> 46:23.740
anyone around. Farts sound like

46:23.740 --> 46:25.740
a beautiful glass flute

46:27.740 --> 46:29.740
and it's

46:29.740 --> 46:31.740
a Tolkien-esque.

46:31.740 --> 46:33.740
If a man hears a woman

46:33.740 --> 46:35.740
fart, he'll be drawn to the ocean

46:35.740 --> 46:37.740
and he'll drown himself

46:37.740 --> 46:39.740
and they don't want to do that to us

46:39.740 --> 46:41.740
because they're one with the tide.

46:41.740 --> 46:43.740
Right.

46:43.740 --> 46:45.740
Right.

46:45.740 --> 46:47.740
And the road

46:47.740 --> 46:49.740
goes ever on.

46:49.740 --> 46:51.740
Ah, Led Zeppelin.

46:51.740 --> 46:53.740
But

46:53.740 --> 46:55.740
I am curious about the female perspective

46:55.740 --> 46:57.740
on not only porn in general but

46:57.740 --> 46:59.740
more importantly the fact that

46:59.740 --> 47:01.740
now it has changed from a world

47:01.740 --> 47:03.740
where you used to

47:03.740 --> 47:05.740
really have to be

47:05.740 --> 47:07.740
dedicated to

47:07.740 --> 47:09.740
a short

47:09.740 --> 47:11.740
you had to take physical action

47:11.740 --> 47:13.740
to seek out

47:13.740 --> 47:15.740
pornography at some point. It's changing

47:15.740 --> 47:17.740
into a world where, no, everyone's

47:17.740 --> 47:19.740
private life and private thoughts

47:19.740 --> 47:21.740
are sort of like their own business

47:21.740 --> 47:23.740
and they're all digital now. Has that

47:23.740 --> 47:25.740
and we'll never be able to measure this because how do you ask

47:25.740 --> 47:27.740
people and how do you measure it but

47:27.740 --> 47:29.740
have women

47:29.740 --> 47:31.740
increased their

47:31.740 --> 47:33.740
pornographic

47:33.740 --> 47:35.740
consumption?

47:35.740 --> 47:37.740
Has their outlook changed

47:37.740 --> 47:39.740
as a result?

47:39.740 --> 47:41.740
You know, there's all

47:41.740 --> 47:43.740
a million fascinating questions that only

47:43.740 --> 47:45.740
that I can't answer.

47:45.740 --> 47:47.740
Only Thor can answer in heaven.

47:47.740 --> 47:49.740
I'll explain my religion

47:49.740 --> 47:51.740
in a minute.

47:51.740 --> 47:53.740
It's sort of a fusion of pop culture

47:53.740 --> 47:55.740
and evangelical Christianity.

47:55.740 --> 47:57.740
I want to

47:57.740 --> 47:59.740
be a Christian but I don't want to read anything

47:59.740 --> 48:01.740
except comic books so

48:01.740 --> 48:03.740
when you die Iron Man

48:03.740 --> 48:05.740
weighs your soul

48:05.740 --> 48:07.740
against Thor's hammer

48:09.740 --> 48:11.740
I'm not surprised Dave Kline

48:11.740 --> 48:13.740
is a Thor fan.

48:15.740 --> 48:17.740
So did I take that

48:17.740 --> 48:19.740
to mean that you, did you marry

48:19.740 --> 48:21.740
a younger lady? I married a younger

48:21.740 --> 48:23.740
yes. We've talked about that.

48:23.740 --> 48:25.740
First wife was older

48:25.740 --> 48:27.740
actually, second wife is younger.

48:27.740 --> 48:29.740
Ah, you old dog.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.740
Did you

48:35.740 --> 48:37.740
I was talking about, I don't know

48:37.740 --> 48:39.740
when you got here.

48:39.740 --> 48:41.740
I threw out my back yesterday and I

48:41.740 --> 48:43.740
I'm sorry baby.

48:43.740 --> 48:45.740
The

48:45.740 --> 48:47.740
I was listening

48:47.740 --> 48:49.740
to a 90s alternative station

48:49.740 --> 48:51.740
while I was soaking my bad back and they had

48:51.740 --> 48:53.740
a hip pain commercial

48:53.740 --> 48:55.740
on the 90s alternative hits.

48:55.740 --> 48:57.740
Anyways, I started to feel old today

48:57.740 --> 48:59.740
not necessarily in a bad way but

48:59.740 --> 49:01.740
I was just curious like thresholds that you've

49:01.740 --> 49:03.740
crossed where

49:03.740 --> 49:05.740
like

49:05.740 --> 49:07.740
if you recall any

49:07.740 --> 49:09.740
I don't know major events

49:09.740 --> 49:11.740
I remember punching the dashboard of

49:11.740 --> 49:13.740
my car on New Year's Eve because I

49:13.740 --> 49:15.740
had just turned 26 and I was like

49:15.740 --> 49:17.740
I'm wasting my fucking life

49:17.740 --> 49:19.740
and I physically

49:19.740 --> 49:21.740
punched the dashboard of my car until it broke

49:21.740 --> 49:23.740
because I was like 26 fucking years old

49:23.740 --> 49:25.740
what have you done

49:25.740 --> 49:27.740
and I was screaming

49:27.740 --> 49:29.740
it to myself alone

49:29.740 --> 49:31.740
on New Year's Eve.

49:31.740 --> 49:33.740
You were alone on New Year's Eve?

49:33.740 --> 49:35.740
That's probably what I was mad about.

49:35.740 --> 49:37.740
And I

49:37.740 --> 49:39.740
wanted to make it about

49:39.740 --> 49:41.740
my

49:41.740 --> 49:43.740
industriousness.

49:45.740 --> 49:47.740
Wow, that's really sad.

49:49.740 --> 49:51.740
I mean I did, I

49:51.740 --> 49:53.740
usually went to the movies on New Year's

49:53.740 --> 49:55.740
Eve. I didn't have any

49:55.740 --> 49:57.740
I don't remember any like

49:57.740 --> 49:59.740
moments of sort of

49:59.740 --> 50:01.740
huge

50:01.740 --> 50:03.740
threshold

50:03.740 --> 50:05.740
experiences where I was

50:05.740 --> 50:07.740
smashing stuff or anything like that

50:07.740 --> 50:09.740
because of a threshold

50:09.740 --> 50:11.740
I mean I used to do stuff like that

50:11.740 --> 50:13.740
but not for any reason.

50:13.740 --> 50:15.740
What did you

50:15.740 --> 50:17.740
smash stuff for? Oh just

50:17.740 --> 50:19.740
to get stuff out and

50:19.740 --> 50:21.740
when I lived in New York

50:21.740 --> 50:23.740
I used to throw knives into the wall

50:23.740 --> 50:25.740
I

50:25.740 --> 50:27.740
had a wall that was where

50:27.740 --> 50:29.740
I would just, you know, late at night

50:29.740 --> 50:31.740
throw knives into it.

50:31.740 --> 50:33.740
Kitchen knives? Just steak knives?

50:33.740 --> 50:35.740
Yeah, yeah.

50:37.740 --> 50:39.740
But I just did that to kill time really.

50:39.740 --> 50:41.740
Yeah, I used to

50:41.740 --> 50:43.740
throw knives when I was younger and

50:43.740 --> 50:45.740
Aaron got me some throwing knives but I don't have the time

50:45.740 --> 50:47.740
to set up a target or anything

50:47.740 --> 50:49.740
and

50:49.740 --> 50:51.740
I used the wall.

50:51.740 --> 50:53.740
I didn't have to set anything up.

50:53.740 --> 50:55.740
Throwing knives is very, very, it's very relaxing.

50:55.740 --> 50:57.740
It's something when you're in your 20s you feel like

50:57.740 --> 50:59.740
you're doing something cool and

50:59.740 --> 51:01.740
it's phallic and you're throwing knives.

51:01.740 --> 51:03.740
I was going to say it's like very, it can't be anything.

51:03.740 --> 51:05.740
You figure that it's something, you know, that cool

51:05.740 --> 51:07.740
people did.

51:07.740 --> 51:09.740
Right, in like a tavern

51:09.740 --> 51:11.740
over a flagon of ale. Exactly.

51:11.740 --> 51:13.740
But really all you're doing is taking a little

51:13.740 --> 51:15.740
metaphor for your ineffective penis

51:15.740 --> 51:17.740
and fucking a wall with it. Exactly.

51:17.740 --> 51:19.740
Because you're just like any other

51:19.740 --> 51:21.740
piece of fucking garbage.

51:21.740 --> 51:23.740
Oh god, yes I know.

51:23.740 --> 51:25.740
Did you

51:25.740 --> 51:27.740
destroy that wall? Pretty much.

51:27.740 --> 51:29.740
But I mean it was an apartment that you wouldn't

51:29.740 --> 51:31.740
notice in particular

51:31.740 --> 51:33.740
so it wasn't a big deal.

51:33.740 --> 51:35.740
But, you know,

51:35.740 --> 51:37.740
you know, you do those things

51:37.740 --> 51:39.740
but I was not,

51:39.740 --> 51:41.740
I didn't smash anything

51:41.740 --> 51:43.740
because I was getting old.

51:43.740 --> 51:45.740
Oh wow, I really got through my whole list.

51:45.740 --> 51:47.740
It's a terrible show.

51:47.740 --> 51:49.740
There's French rappers

51:49.740 --> 51:51.740
staying at the Airbnb next to us.

51:51.740 --> 51:53.740
I mean I could start ripping out their ears. You mean when you're down in San Diego?

51:53.740 --> 51:55.740
No.

51:55.740 --> 51:57.740
Oh, thank you. God damn it.

51:57.740 --> 51:59.740
Jesus, we have lots to talk about. San Diego.

51:59.740 --> 52:01.740
We're going to be at San Diego next week.

52:01.740 --> 52:03.740
Yes you are. I really do.

52:03.740 --> 52:05.740
Yeah, and... Are you coming, Curtis?

52:05.740 --> 52:07.740
I'm going there but not when you're there.

52:07.740 --> 52:09.740
I'm going earlier.

52:09.740 --> 52:11.740
When? I'm going

52:11.740 --> 52:13.740
Thursday. We're going to be down there Thursday

52:13.740 --> 52:15.740
but not when we're doing the show.

52:15.740 --> 52:17.740
Not when you're doing the show.

52:17.740 --> 52:19.740
Yeah, Padgett Brewster is going to be down there but she's down there.

52:19.740 --> 52:21.740
She said, you're not there till Thursday, right?

52:21.740 --> 52:23.740
And they said, yeah, how early are you supposed to go?

52:23.740 --> 52:25.740
She said, she's going down Wednesday.

52:25.740 --> 52:27.740
I'm like, what are you going to help

52:27.740 --> 52:29.740
a TV guide set up their yacht?

52:29.740 --> 52:31.740
Exactly.

52:31.740 --> 52:33.740
I don't understand.

52:33.740 --> 52:35.740
It's such a social thing. It's an amazingly social thing.

52:35.740 --> 52:37.740
I was actually going down there

52:37.740 --> 52:39.740
because I got invited

52:39.740 --> 52:41.740
because I've never been to Comic-Con

52:41.740 --> 52:43.740
as a fan and yet I'm a huge fan

52:43.740 --> 52:45.740
and I want to go to Comic-Con

52:45.740 --> 52:47.740
as a fan

52:47.740 --> 52:49.740
but then I always get wind up getting

52:49.740 --> 52:51.740
tagged and I never wind up

52:51.740 --> 52:53.740
actually doing what I want to do.

52:53.740 --> 52:55.740
Usually I go there because I'm selling

52:55.740 --> 52:57.740
something like everybody else.

52:57.740 --> 52:59.740
When you say tag, do you mean like...

52:59.740 --> 53:01.740
They spot you.

53:01.740 --> 53:03.740
Yeah, because I'm wandering around

53:03.740 --> 53:05.740
and they think I'm there for Comic-Con

53:05.740 --> 53:07.740
as a...

53:07.740 --> 53:09.740
like I'm selling something.

53:09.740 --> 53:11.740
Usually I'm just there

53:11.740 --> 53:13.740
to look at things that I like

53:13.740 --> 53:15.740
and so this time

53:15.740 --> 53:17.740
I've been invited to go

53:17.740 --> 53:19.740
because I'm a big fan

53:19.740 --> 53:21.740
of Orphan Black

53:21.740 --> 53:23.740
and they're down there

53:23.740 --> 53:25.740
and they invited me to come down.

53:25.740 --> 53:27.740
So I'm going to go as a fan to Orphan Black

53:27.740 --> 53:29.740
but then I'm also going to see

53:29.740 --> 53:31.740
Thursday night the Baker Street Babes

53:31.740 --> 53:33.740
which is

53:33.740 --> 53:35.740
an all women's Sherlock Holmes group

53:35.740 --> 53:37.740
that I'm connected with.

53:37.740 --> 53:39.740
What's this

53:39.740 --> 53:41.740
Sherlock Holmes group?

53:41.740 --> 53:43.740
Well, it's a group of people

53:43.740 --> 53:45.740
who study the sacred writings.

53:45.740 --> 53:47.740
Oh, they study, okay.

53:47.740 --> 53:49.740
It's all women.

53:49.740 --> 53:51.740
It's a new group.

53:51.740 --> 53:53.740
They formed in New York

53:53.740 --> 53:55.740
as sort of a cheeky response

53:55.740 --> 53:57.740
to the old guard Sherlockians of New York

53:57.740 --> 53:59.740
and

53:59.740 --> 54:01.740
they're going to be there.

54:01.740 --> 54:03.740
So I'm going to go down and play with them

54:03.740 --> 54:05.740
but that's what happens is you go down

54:05.740 --> 54:07.740
to what the pageant's doing.

54:07.740 --> 54:09.740
She's going down to just

54:09.740 --> 54:11.740
play with people.

54:11.740 --> 54:13.740
Mm-hmm.

54:13.740 --> 54:15.740
Is it a performance?

54:15.740 --> 54:17.740
The Sherlock people?

54:17.740 --> 54:19.740
They've got a booth and stuff

54:19.740 --> 54:21.740
and we're just going to...

54:21.740 --> 54:23.740
When you say play you mean literally just hang out

54:23.740 --> 54:25.740
because I know them from New York.

54:25.740 --> 54:27.740
So yeah

54:27.740 --> 54:29.740
and if you ever want to get away from the

54:29.740 --> 54:31.740
and just float freely through the crowd

54:31.740 --> 54:33.740
you get to graduate

54:33.740 --> 54:35.740
and dress like a stormtrooper or something.

54:35.740 --> 54:37.740
I know, I know. I was going to do that

54:37.740 --> 54:39.740
and this all happened at the last minute

54:39.740 --> 54:41.740
so I don't have time to put the costume together

54:41.740 --> 54:43.740
or I would have done that.

54:43.740 --> 54:45.740
What would you go as if you could go as any costume character?

54:45.740 --> 54:47.740
I was going to go

54:47.740 --> 54:49.740
as one of the characters

54:49.740 --> 54:51.740
that Tatiana Maslany plays

54:51.740 --> 54:53.740
in Orphan Black.

54:53.740 --> 54:55.740
I wasn't going to just cosplay

54:55.740 --> 54:57.740
for the first time.

54:57.740 --> 54:59.740
I was going to drag cosplay.

54:59.740 --> 55:01.740
And I was going to play

55:01.740 --> 55:03.740
I was going to play Helena

55:03.740 --> 55:05.740
who's the psychotic killer

55:05.740 --> 55:07.740
and

55:07.740 --> 55:09.740
but then I realized I had to do it

55:09.740 --> 55:11.740
properly and I didn't have time to do it properly

55:11.740 --> 55:13.740
so now I just say the hell with it

55:13.740 --> 55:15.740
I'm going to wander around and whatever happens happens.

55:15.740 --> 55:17.740
Erin is

55:17.740 --> 55:19.740
supposedly

55:19.740 --> 55:21.740
cooking up a little combo

55:21.740 --> 55:23.740
costume for us that I encouraged

55:23.740 --> 55:25.740
her to do.

55:25.740 --> 55:27.740
I hope she can pull off

55:27.740 --> 55:29.740
and she usually tends to.

55:29.740 --> 55:31.740
What is your show going to be down there?

55:31.740 --> 55:33.740
Where do you do that?

55:33.740 --> 55:35.740
Funny you should ask.

55:35.740 --> 55:37.740
We're going to be at the tin roof

55:37.740 --> 55:39.740
in the gas lamp district

55:39.740 --> 55:41.740
gas light, gas lamp

55:41.740 --> 55:43.740
get to the gas light

55:43.740 --> 55:45.740
you've gone too far and you want to go

55:45.740 --> 55:47.740
but it's still a lamp

55:47.740 --> 55:49.740
but not all the way to the light bulb

55:49.740 --> 55:51.740
that's way too far.

55:51.740 --> 55:53.740
If you get to gas town you're in Vancouver.

55:55.740 --> 55:57.740
It's at the tin roof in the gas lamp light

55:57.740 --> 55:59.740
and it's

55:59.740 --> 56:01.740
on Sunday night so

56:01.740 --> 56:03.740
stay the extra night if you can

56:03.740 --> 56:05.740
there's still seats

56:05.740 --> 56:07.740
available as far as I know but it's a

56:07.740 --> 56:09.740
good size crowd it'll be a good show anyway

56:09.740 --> 56:11.740
but here's incentive

56:11.740 --> 56:13.740
if you need it there's going to be Erin's

56:13.740 --> 56:15.740
been making merchandise and stuff

56:15.740 --> 56:17.740
there's going to be

56:17.740 --> 56:19.740
limited edition MC John

56:19.740 --> 56:21.740
t-shirts

56:21.740 --> 56:23.740
I guess

56:23.740 --> 56:25.740
in order to make them truly limited edition

56:25.740 --> 56:27.740
we will only sell them

56:27.740 --> 56:29.740
that night

56:29.740 --> 56:31.740
and

56:31.740 --> 56:33.740
really the only reason we'll sell them instead of giving away

56:33.740 --> 56:35.740
is because we couldn't make enough to give away

56:35.740 --> 56:37.740
and then bring them on the bus so we'll just have them

56:37.740 --> 56:39.740
there available

56:39.740 --> 56:41.740
and I think there's another t-shirt

56:41.740 --> 56:43.740
she's working on and I know there's a print

56:43.740 --> 56:45.740
of a shadow run

56:45.740 --> 56:47.740
poster.

56:47.740 --> 56:49.740
It's made by the same guy who did

56:49.740 --> 56:51.740
the D&D line art drawing

56:51.740 --> 56:53.740
from the first tour it's Anthony Suarez

56:53.740 --> 56:55.740
did this shadow run group

56:55.740 --> 56:57.740
of the gang

56:57.740 --> 56:59.740
and I think there's going to be a free Rick and Morty

56:59.740 --> 57:01.740
poster that you can get to

57:01.740 --> 57:03.740
and the drawing is Dr.

57:03.740 --> 57:05.740
Friend, Kumail or should it more rightly

57:05.740 --> 57:07.740
be Curtis? It's Kumail

57:07.740 --> 57:09.740
It's Kumail!

57:09.740 --> 57:11.740
It's alright, I understand

57:11.740 --> 57:13.740
I think it's really funny to imagine

57:13.740 --> 57:15.740
this Kumail troll but then it's

57:15.740 --> 57:17.740
your voice coming out of it like

57:17.740 --> 57:19.740
I'm a doctor

57:19.740 --> 57:21.740
I really like that mental image personally

57:21.740 --> 57:23.740
so it's good

57:23.740 --> 57:25.740
so yeah

57:25.740 --> 57:27.740
come, come, come there

57:27.740 --> 57:29.740
come, come, come all

57:29.740 --> 57:31.740
come, come everywhere and bring your scarf and shawl

57:31.740 --> 57:33.740
I'm the little show promoter

57:33.740 --> 57:35.740
and I'm three feet tall

57:37.740 --> 57:39.740
come, come over there

57:39.740 --> 57:41.740
come, come to the south

57:41.740 --> 57:43.740
come, come on your feet

57:43.740 --> 57:45.740
come, come in my mouth

57:45.740 --> 57:47.740
I'm a little show promoter

57:47.740 --> 57:49.740
I'm three feet tall

57:49.740 --> 57:51.740
I'm a tree

57:51.740 --> 57:53.740
all I do is promote shows

57:53.740 --> 57:55.740
all that I see

57:55.740 --> 57:57.740
please go to see Rob Schneider at the

57:57.740 --> 57:59.740
truck show

57:59.740 --> 58:01.740
he was in Dukes of Hazard and now he's nowhere to go

58:01.740 --> 58:03.740
because his car had a racist flag on it

58:03.740 --> 58:05.740
I'm a little show promoter

58:05.740 --> 58:07.740
and I wear a bonnet

58:07.740 --> 58:09.740
it was my mom's idea

58:09.740 --> 58:11.740
she made me a baby

58:11.740 --> 58:13.740
I wanna fuck her or kill her or maybe

58:13.740 --> 58:15.740
wait

58:19.740 --> 58:21.740
I disagree

58:21.740 --> 58:23.740
three feet tall show promoter

58:23.740 --> 58:25.740
why do you wanna fuck or kill your mother

58:27.740 --> 58:29.740
you try being born

58:29.740 --> 58:31.740
three feet tall and not having fucking

58:31.740 --> 58:33.740
psychosexual issues

58:35.740 --> 58:37.740
with your mother that made you wear a bonnet

58:37.740 --> 58:39.740
were you listening to the lyrics

58:39.740 --> 58:41.740
I live in a fucking tree

58:41.740 --> 58:43.740
that would fuck anyone up

58:43.740 --> 58:45.740
if you have that much pent-up rage

58:45.740 --> 58:47.740
what made you become a show promoter

58:47.740 --> 58:49.740
I need that hug

58:49.740 --> 58:51.740
you can only get from a stranger

58:51.740 --> 58:53.740
what the fuck

58:55.740 --> 58:57.740
why not be a performer yourself

58:57.740 --> 58:59.740
why not go into actually being

58:59.740 --> 59:01.740
in the show, why only promote other people's

59:01.740 --> 59:03.740
creativity

59:03.740 --> 59:05.740
look at this scar on my face

59:07.740 --> 59:09.740
I didn't see it

59:09.740 --> 59:11.740
thanks for saying that

59:11.740 --> 59:13.740
you were facing the other way

59:15.740 --> 59:17.740
I like to be close to talent

59:19.740 --> 59:21.740
and I like to help it

59:21.740 --> 59:23.740
I don't feel comfortable on stage

59:23.740 --> 59:25.740
it's not a choice that I make

59:25.740 --> 59:27.740
did you ever try when you were younger to be on stage

59:27.740 --> 59:29.740
I dabbled

59:31.740 --> 59:33.740
I'm fine with it

59:33.740 --> 59:35.740
I'll be on stage, I'll do it if you want to

59:35.740 --> 59:37.740
but I don't have to

59:37.740 --> 59:39.740
I don't have to

59:39.740 --> 59:41.740
I don't have to

59:41.740 --> 59:43.740
I think those people are crazy

59:43.740 --> 59:45.740
I don't have to, I like to promote it

59:45.740 --> 59:47.740
I like what I do, I think what I do is creative

59:53.740 --> 59:55.740
why are you only three feet tall

59:55.740 --> 59:57.740
is that a congenital thing

59:57.740 --> 59:59.740
I made a choice

59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.740
at a very ill advised fair

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:05.740
I tell people don't go

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.740
there's a lot of questionable

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.740
vendors there

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.740
I did get my name on a grain of rice

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.740
but

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.740
also I had

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.740
most of my

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.740
lower torso removed

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:21.740
I thought it was

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.740
I thought he meant for a picture

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.740
so you're not just a little person

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.740
you're a regular-sized person with no legs

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.740
I paid for this

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.740
it's the fucked up thing

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.740
so you can imagine I'm a man

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.740
with no country

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.740
I go to little people conventions

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.740
actually no I don't anymore

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.740
they're fucking assholes

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.740
to me

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.740
and

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.740
I think you know how your people treat me

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.740
so I

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.740
do what I do, I hang out

01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:59.740
and I'm not bitter

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.740
and

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.740
I promote shows

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.740
whenever I start singing

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.740
people start clapping automatically

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:09.740
which makes me feel

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.740
can I ask you a question

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.740
and this is off the record

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:15.740
are you excited about

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.740
the Harmontown Bing in the Gaslight

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.740
or Lamp District

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.740
or is that you just

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.740
clocking in doing your job singing the song

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.740
a good promoter remains objective

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:27.740
you know

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.740
like I always tell people

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:31.740
your craft is what you do

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.740
my craft is promotion

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.740
so for instance I just finished

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:37.740
you know frankly and this isn't going to win me any popularity

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.740
contests but what the fuck is

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.740
I just finished

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.740
doing some radio spots for a Ku Klux Klan

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:47.740
rally

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:57.740
we have audio back there

01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.740
Justin let's roll that clip

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.740
come one come all come

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.740
to the Ku Klux Klan

01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.740
I'm going to print some crosses and talk about

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:09.740
minorities being bad

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.740
and color being red

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.740
I have a Ku Klux Klan

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:15.740
you should come to our rally

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.740
grand wizard you should come

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:19.740
and we're going to wear white and

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.740
our hats are pointy and we're going to

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:23.740
march around and jump around and have good

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.740
times and there's a daycare center

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.740
if you bring your kids

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.740
and there's horseshoes

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.740
it's 9-11 it's 9-11

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.740
I forgot to ask you

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.740
last question

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.740
last question

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.740
three feet tall

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.740
show promoter

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.740
what's your name

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.740
so we can have a t-shirt

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.740
tie

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:53.740
tie

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.740
T-A-Y-E

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.740
tie

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.740
tie

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.740
T-A-Y-E

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:03.740
tie

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.740
T-A-Y-E

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.740
were you born

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:11.740
T-A-Y-E or are you reinventing

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.740
yourself

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.740
my given name is

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:17.740
Jonathan Tye Brigston

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.740
my father Jonathan

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.740
was a narcissistic asshole

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.740
so I go

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.740
by my middle name it is no less

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:27.740
my name it was the only way to tell me

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.740
from him when you called my house

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.740
is John there oh which one

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.740
who subjects someone to that

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:37.740
I go by my middle name

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.740
what was the booth where they cut your legs

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:41.740
off at the fair

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:43.740
a tiny

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.740
tiny tiny you

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.740
exclamation

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.740
points

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.740
and it had pictures of people

01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.740
and they were

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:01.740
given height

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:03.740
and then next to them was like before

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.740
after and they were smaller I thought it was

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.740
gag photography

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.740
so you didn't wish you were actually smaller

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.740
you thought it would be a photo

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:13.740
I thought I would walk out of there

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.740
with a photo

01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:19.740
so they removed your legs

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:23.740
they took some of my lower torso

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:25.740
enough

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.740
you have a small intestine and a large intestine

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.740
they took

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.740
most of my large intestine

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:33.740
took some of my small intestine and moved it down

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.740
there to take its place

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:37.740
they took a tiny bit of my small intestine

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.740
because it's smaller and you can't live with

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.740
most of it

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:43.740
gone

01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:45.740
they

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.740
they cut my

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.740
thigh

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:51.740
and my

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.740
they cut my legs off at the hip

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:55.740
cut my thighs

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:57.740
and my calves in half

01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:59.740
and then took half of each

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:01.740
and hinged them

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.740
with these

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.740
with my own kneecaps

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.740
and then did this similar thing

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.740
with my arms

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.740
they just wanted me to be

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.740
is tiny

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.740
me still in existence?

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:21.740
tiny you

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:23.740
and here's the thing that I'm not telling you

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.740
because it embarrasses me

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.740
and makes me the villain of this story instead of the victim

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:29.740
but I've told my story and no one cares

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:31.740
which is why I work in promotion now

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.740
the truth of it is

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:35.740
on my way

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.740
into the fair

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:39.740
Burning Man

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.740
I ran over a dwarf family

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:49.740
on

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.740
on the way in

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.740
on the way in

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:55.740
parking was hard

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.740
I don't know if you've been to Burning Man

01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:59.740
it's all about

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.740
being a hippie and all this stuff

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.740
but it's fucking hard to park

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:05.740
and it gets frustrating and I was

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.740
a different person back then

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:09.740
I ran over a dwarf family

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:11.740
got out of the car

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:13.740
did you kill them? did they survive?

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.740
I got out of the car

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:17.740
sorry

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.740
I ran to the

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.740
only remaining living

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:23.740
dwarf

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:29.740
was this a child or one of the adults?

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.740
was an elderly woman dressed in

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.740
I guess what I would describe as shamanic

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:35.740
attire

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:37.740
as I reached for her

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.740
to ask if she was okay

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:45.740
she had insurance

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:47.740
her hand gripped my face

01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.740
and her toothless mouth

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:51.740
hissed

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.740
sharder

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.740
I laughed it off

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.740
you must have thought she was just a big Stephen King fan

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:07.740
yeah I said

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:09.740
that's ridiculous

01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:11.740
let's get you to a hospital

01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:13.740
and then the stupid me

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.740
and this is the part that's really embarrassing

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.740
when I saw that booth

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:19.740
I said to my wife wouldn't this be hilarious

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:21.740
given the events earlier

01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:23.740
so yeah

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.740
I deserve it

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.740
is that what you want to

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.740
that's the conclusion everyone

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:31.740
that hears the story comes to

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.740
I stopped telling it

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:35.740
so I'm in promotion

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.740
and it's on other people

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:39.740
it's a little embarrassing

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.740
when you go into tiny you

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:43.740
and you're in the booth and it's not a photograph thing

01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.740
there's actually a surgical procedure that happens

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.740
do they knock you out

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.740
are you

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.740
are you alert during this procedure

01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:53.740
okay you're going to drag

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.740
every embarrassing detail out of this

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:57.740
I'm only asking because

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.740
this is riveting shit

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.740
this is very

01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:03.740
I was on

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:05.740
already I was at Burning Man

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.740
I took peyote but that's why I hit the Dwarven family

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:09.740
I was

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.740
every drug known to man

01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:13.740
there was no police came there was no

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.740
there's no cops at Burning Man bro

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:17.740
you want cops

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.740
go to the G8 summit

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:21.740
motherfucker

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.740
so

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:25.740
okay so you got peyote

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:27.740
you're going to tiny you

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:29.740
peyote mescaline

01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:31.740
I put a tiny

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.740
peyote and mescaline

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:35.740
just covering

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:37.740
your bases they call it a curve ball

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.740
you do those at the same time

01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:43.740
I have

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:45.740
three Ritalin

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.740
and I think

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:49.740
a little bit of a couple tutors

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.740
a coke and

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.740
some poppers of Amel

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:55.740
and a little bit of VHS

01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.740
head cleaner to dilate my sphincter

01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.740
just in case

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.740
back then I cared

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.740
how big it was

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.740
what do they call Amel nitrate poppers and VHS head cleaner

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:07.740
well

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:09.740
Amel nitrate poppers

01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.740
it puts you in the mood

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.740
is there a nickname like curve ball

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.740
for doing those both

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.740
that's just called a garage

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:19.740
because

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.740
it opens you up and then

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.740
with the urge to host

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.740
a car

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:27.740
so you

01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:29.740
you

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:33.740
you're driving down to Burning Man

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.740
you're on a curve ball and a garage

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.740
a couple tutors of coke

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.740
just to take the edge off

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:45.740
you murder

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:47.740
a family of little people

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.740
the cops don't come

01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:51.740
because they're not there

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:53.740
they're at the G8

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:55.740
you and your wife

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:57.740
go too far

01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.740
wow

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.740
fucking so high right now

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.740
there's a booth there called TinyU

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.740
you go in there, who do you meet

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.740
what's the person that works at

01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:09.740
like

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:11.740
I want to know everything

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.740
first of all

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:15.740
why isn't there like a date line

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:17.740
on TinyU

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.740
like

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:21.740
why haven't this terrible

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.740
company not been outed for

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:25.740
they conduct their business

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:27.740
in the back alleys

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.740
and Burning Man's of the world

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:31.740
and they get away with it

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:33.740
this is something I've been screaming about

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.740
but no one wants to hear my story

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.740
and as you've noticed

01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:39.740
when I get enthusiastic about anything

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:41.740
everyone starts clapping because I'm fucking

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:43.740
yeah, yeah

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.740
it's hard being me and being dehumanized

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.740
you know and takes me seriously

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.740
it's like I'm a leprechaun all the time

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:51.740
and everyone just keeps clapping

01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.740
by talking in rhymes sometimes

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.740
but I don't try to all the time

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:57.740
this is exactly what happened

01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:59.740
in the courtroom

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.740
and I left

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:11.740
I left, I stormed out

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:13.740
one of the problems is

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.740
because my legs are made of half

01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:17.740
femur, half calf

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.740
when I storm out

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.740
it looks like dancing

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.740
and of course

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.740
they didn't do it precisely

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.740
so one leg is shorter than the other

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.740
so I dance in a circle

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:33.740
so I start saying

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:35.740
things I'm passionate about

01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:37.740
everyone starts clapping

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.740
I get mad, I want to leave

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.740
I'm dancing in a circle

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:43.740
and this is my life

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:45.740
so I'm in promotion

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.740
and I like it

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.740
my name is Ty Brigston

01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:59.740
and I'm a new classic Harmontown character

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:03.740
that

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.740
is really offensive

01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.740
and

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.740
wow, thanks for coming Ty

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:15.740
yeah, okay

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.740
good morning

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.740
morning zoo team

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:23.740
let's get Damorge out here

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:35.740
Damorge!

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:39.740
DeMorge Brown

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.740
yes sir

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:43.740
hey Damorge, not because

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:45.740
you're black but because you're my black friend

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:49.740
that I am

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.740
I know you're not

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:53.740
you're not an ambassador of your race

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:55.740
far from it

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:57.740
the things this guy does

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:01.740
but I just personally

01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:03.740
how do you feel about

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.740
when you see a fast food commercial

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.740
that's like

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.740
targeting

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:11.740
have you been?

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:13.740
you know all those Burger Kings with Joel McHale

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.740
I'm the black guy in those ads

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.740
but being the black guy in

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:19.740
but I'm talking about the ads where

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:21.740
it is black and the soundtrack

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:23.740
it's been a running thing

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:25.740
with me

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.740
because there are certain ads that have black people in them

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.740
and they're just ads with black people

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.740
and then there are ads that are black

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.740
and the best example I can give

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.740
of this is I had an audition once

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:37.740
and I had an agent who was like

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.740
I know you've had four today

01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:41.740
I'm going to send you on a fifth

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:43.740
you gotta go

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.740
because I can't believe this is real

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.740
and I had a clause

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.740
of my thing

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.740
like when I first signed with them they said

01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.740
is there anything you won't do

01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:55.740
and I said I won't do cigarette stuff

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.740
and no KFC

01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.740
and this is

01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:01.740
and she said it's a KFC thing

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.740
just go please do it for me

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.740
you'll never I know just go

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.740
and you'll see what I mean

01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:09.740
and so I get there and there's two ads

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.740
there's a black ad and there's a white ad

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.740
and the white ad is that there's a guy

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.740
who's got a yellow corvette

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.740
and there's a girl next to him

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:19.740
and he's eating chicken fingers

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.740
and she's like oh I just want to try it

01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:23.740
I just want to get in it

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:25.740
and ultimately she's talking about the chicken fingers

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:27.740
oh my god

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:29.740
it's like an old Henry novel

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:31.740
she thought he was talking about the car

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.740
the black ad

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:35.740
is

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.740
incredibly different

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:39.740
and the room

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.740
is different everybody's in the same room

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.740
but the white people are sort of just hanging out chatting

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.740
and then there are these black

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:47.740
and I know that these are actors

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:49.740
these are stage actors people who know the story

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:51.740
dying laughing they're sitting in their seats

01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:53.740
and you see these people going

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.740
I'm gonna eat that chicken

01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.740
we're gonna eat that chicken

01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:59.740
and I get the script and the script says

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.740
it opens with a description

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.740
the THA boys

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:05.740
are watching the game

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:09.740
mama's in the kitchen

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:11.740
fixing up some kitchen fresh chicken

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.740
because

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.740
they were trying to take the word fried out of

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.740
Kentucky Fried Chicken

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.740
and then apparently what happens is

01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:21.740
the mom

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:23.740
the wife of one of the three guys

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:25.740
watching the game comes in

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.740
sees the mom in there and gets jealous

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:29.740
she's been shopping shopping

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.740
and then she gets upset

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:33.740
so I'm looking at this

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:35.740
I'm looking at these guys and then there's three of us

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.740
we go in the room and the guy sets with the audition

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:39.740
the audition is like this

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.740
we're gonna do the ad three times once for each of you guys

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:43.740
and I'm gonna give notes

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.740
the cast directors I'll give notes

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.740
the first guy

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.740
gives his best shot the first line is

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:51.740
the woman comes in she goes what are you guys doing

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.740
and the guy's first line is

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.740
the line is written

01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:57.740
eating kitchen fresh chicken

01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.740
and the guy says eating

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:01.740
kitchen fresh chicken it's subtly as best

01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:03.740
as he can the guy gives notes

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:05.740
and he says

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:07.740
no notes to him to the wife

01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:09.740
you should be really mad

01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:11.740
you see this mom is in here

01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:13.740
and she's in your territory so

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:15.740
I don't know if you've ever seen Rolanda

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.740
but your next gotta pop and you gotta

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.740
and mama if you could just

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:21.740
really make that chicken for us

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:23.740
anyway go and then the second take

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:25.740
they come around and come to me

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:27.740
and I've already decided I'm gonna do this

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:29.740
snagglepuss boys for the line

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:31.740
so I

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:33.740
they come to me

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.740
and then she says the line

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.740
and you know glistening a bit at this point

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:39.740
and I say eating a

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:41.740
kitchen fresh

01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:45.740
the guy comes over

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:47.740
no notes for me

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:49.740
honestly I don't know if you've

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:51.740
seen Rolanda but you

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.740
like the women they get upset and you gotta

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:55.740
and mama honestly

01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:57.740
with the chicken you know maybe if you open up more

01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:59.740
we'll see more of you so we can do that

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.740
the third guy

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:03.740
tops me he does this

01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:05.740
he did it

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:11.740
and the craziest part about it is

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.740
I get a callback

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.740
I go to the

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.740
callback that dude is there

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.740
not the other guy

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.740
so I'm like

01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.740
look at this I go there's gotta be somebody in a room

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:25.740
that said I want to see these guys again

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.740
we're paired together

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:29.740
oh yeah that's definitely an inside job there

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:31.740
so I get outside

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:33.740
I get out of the room because I can see them

01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:35.740
they're there and the client

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:37.740
is enjoying their time in LA

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:39.740
they're loving their time in LA

01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:41.740
so they're ordering Peking duck and then mad

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:43.740
because what do you mean they have to call ahead

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.740
it takes eight hours to make Peking duck some shit like that

01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:47.740
and so they're very much like

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.740
they're the people who wrote the ad

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.740
or approved it or did whatever

01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.740
and I'm looking at this guy and the guy goes

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.740
you gonna do the same thing

01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:57.740
and I said

01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.740
yeah probably am

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.740
and then the door flies open

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:03.740
and this Allie McGraw

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.740
woman walks out

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:07.740
live lovely

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:09.740
riding boots up to here a white

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:11.740
fisherman sweater with a blue marijuana leaf

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.740
on it doesn't even look

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.740
at us takes out a cigarette

01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:17.740
takes a drag blows it straight into the air

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:19.740
then looks at us out of the corner

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:21.740
where I smiles and goes in a room and I go

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.740
that's the wild card and I go

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.740
and I bet you anything there's a black guy in there

01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:27.740
and he's probably wearing a polo

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.740
and his name is

01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:31.740
George

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.740
and he just wants a corner office and they probably

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:35.740
said oh shit run by George and George said

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:37.740
oh yes great and we go in the

01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:39.740
room and there's a dude in a lavender polo

01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:41.740
sitting in a corner

01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:43.740
with a bristly mustache and his head's down

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:45.740
he's flipping through notes and he looks up and then he looks down right away

01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.740
and we did the same thing

01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:49.740
they called me to give me the job

01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:51.740
and I was like what

01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:53.740
kitchen fresh

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.740
in the room with them I said

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:57.740
kitchen fresh

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:01.740
with no intention of doing the job

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:03.740
with no intention of doing the job

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.740
I have no idea

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.740
I really don't know I don't think it ultimately I don't think it matters

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.740
and I think even if they recognize that that's what you're doing

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:11.740
they will

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:13.740
they realize that on the day if you're the actor they think

01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:15.740
you are and they think very little often

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.740
sometimes when they're making those types of ads

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:19.740
of actors they think well we get them on the day

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:21.740
the actor will do the thing

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.740
you think there's full awareness of what's going on there

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:25.740
somewhere in the production company

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:27.740
or somewhere somebody's notes

01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.740
I'm 42 years old

01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:31.740
I'm lucky enough to have been doing shit for 20 years

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:33.740
that involved directing people

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.740
tweaking performances and stuff

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.740
and I have at least

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:39.740
at least four

01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.740
occasions had to ask a black

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:43.740
performer to basically black it up

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:45.740
because it was

01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:47.740
part of the

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:49.740
no murder he grabs

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:51.740
I think you need to march

01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:53.740
you need to do it

01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.740
because I was doing straight reads on the lines

01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:57.740
but there's always this brick wall

01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.740
where we all know what's going on

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:01.740
there's this uncomfortable moment

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:03.740
it's almost like a reverse handshake

01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:05.740
where Jordan Peele

01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.740
came in and did

01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:09.740
this time monster

01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.740
the dialogue was written

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.740
we wrote it for

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:15.740
Key and Peele

01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:17.740
the idea was these fourth dimensional

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:19.740
time monster creatures come in

01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:21.740
and their dialect is like

01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:23.740
they're very black

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.740
but

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.740
very

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.740
and it's not my friend

01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:31.740
kitchen fresh chicken

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:33.740
as in

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.740
but you know when you talk about those ads

01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:37.740
for example Adolf Caesar

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.740
one time when I was learning to get

01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:41.740
I had a wonderful voice over teacher for commercials

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:43.740
in Boston and she gave me a Don Buchwald

01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:45.740
audition tape one time

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.740
I think Adolf Caesar's voice was on there

01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:49.740
every black ad ever

01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.740
from one of the greatest actors of all time

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.740
and you'll recognize it's the guy that said

01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:55.740
a mind is a terrible thing to waste

01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:57.740
that guy and he had like a BC powder

01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:59.740
aspirin like aspirin powder ad

01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:01.740
was like you got a dirty low down

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.740
rotten headache

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.740
every ad was amazing

01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:07.740
and he's in an ad I saw this

01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:09.740
only one time during the Grammys

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.740
when I was a kid and I don't know where this ad is

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:13.740
if they find it it will go viral

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:15.740
it was a black McDonald's ad

01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:17.740
I think targeted at the Grammys

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:19.740
with James Brown in it

01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:21.740
but only for a moment and it's black kids in a McDonald's

01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:23.740
going oh they run up to the show

01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:25.740
and it's like James Brown concert

01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:27.740
sold out and they're like oh man

01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:29.740
we didn't make it in time

01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:31.740
hey fellas look across the street

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.740
there's McDonald's we're gonna make a deal

01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:35.740
oh it's alright

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.740
when there's not enough James Brown

01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:39.740
I'm gonna get a big man what are you gonna get

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.740
I don't know but I know when I get up there

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:43.740
and then they're waiting in line

01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:45.740
so far this is a great commercial

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:47.740
this is why I don't know

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:49.740
I only saw this once the door

01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:51.740
flies open in the last second

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:53.740
the door flies open James Brown

01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:55.740
comes in the entire thing on one leg

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:57.740
and he goes it's a good time

01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:59.740
for the great taste of McDonald's

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.740
and then the guys high five

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:03.740
end of ad and then while it's going on

01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:05.740
I think it's Adolf Caesar's voice at the end

01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:07.740
it's like you know

01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:09.740
what's up get on down

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.740
to Mickey D

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:13.740
okay so

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.740
original question

01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:17.740
you can find that ad

01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.740
you gotta get up to get down

01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:21.740
so forget as an actor okay so

01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:23.740
you were in the trenches

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:25.740
on the actor side

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:27.740
can you compartmentalize as a viewer

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:29.740
when those commercials come on

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:31.740
what happens to you and your brain

01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:33.740
I was a kid I recognized it immediately

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.740
as a black ad and I put it in my black ad

01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:37.740
trunk

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.740
which is you see them all

01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:41.740
it's like they were markedly low risk

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:43.740
and they were markedly worse on average

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:45.740
it was always oh it's black grandmother

01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:47.740
there's black birthday she's going a black

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:49.740
Pontiac

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.740
let's hope she gets her black

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.740
loan like it was always at mama

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.740
try out the bucket seats you know

01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:57.740
it was always that kind of stuff as opposed to

01:22:57.740 --> 01:22:59.740
just other ads which were subtle and

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.740
weirder and stuff but what was great was

01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:03.740
there were other ads with black people in them

01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:05.740
that didn't even target race like there was a

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:07.740
little Caesar dad or something

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:09.740
no no it was the same people who made the little

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:11.740
Caesar's ads made an ad

01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:13.740
for like a sale at a

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.740
department store sale or something like that

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:17.740
and they cut

01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.740
to all these different people who were like

01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:21.740
I wish I had known about

01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:23.740
the sale and then they cut to this one black

01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:25.740
guy who's in the ad he dominates

01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.740
the ad and he's a hot dog

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:29.740
vendor and he goes I'm holding my weenie

01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:31.740
and poof my woman was gone

01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:35.740
and that's like another

01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:37.740
black it's just the ad is just

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:39.740
people everywhere go to this sale

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:41.740
and this guy steals it just by being himself

01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:47.740
usually the old little Caesar ads the ones I had

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:49.740
the dog and different ones where they were like

01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:51.740
really odd and strange and arch

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:53.740
so jury's out

01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:55.740
yeah I mean they're horrible

01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.740
they're like I think that they're I think

01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:59.740
they're horrible and I but I think what's happened is

01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:03.740
we're all starting to get the clearest

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:05.740
picture it's the same thing about soccer

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.740
perceptions of soccer and that kind of stuff and like

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:09.740
I've never known a world where soccer didn't rule

01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.740
and everybody was into it and it was a thing

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:13.740
and I grew up along most people who I think

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:15.740
for a while like oh no no never catch on it's like

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:17.740
everybody I know played it and in black

01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.740
there's a world where

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.740
I know that everybody

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.740
my relatives my friends and their relatives they buy

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:25.740
everything that everybody else buys our consumer

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:27.740
dollars worth everything everybody else's is

01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:29.740
but also people made fun of that movie Rachel's

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:31.740
wedding because they're like no combinations of

01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.740
people f of any ethnicity exists like

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:35.740
this and do these kinds of things that's all I ever

01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:37.740
knew growing up and I knew grew up

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.740
around all these people these perceptions

01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:41.740
of the world are now

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:45.740
commonplace and so you get ads where it's

01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:47.740
you know black ads that are subtle and

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.740
delightful you get ads that are

01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:51.740
that are target to everybody but are

01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:53.740
primarily

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.740
black just by ethnicity because they're putting

01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:57.740
a black family on for the first time or black

01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:59.740
husband and wife or

01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:01.740
couples of mixed ethnicity

01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:03.740
confusing is because when you go like what

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:05.740
what is television's role and what is the

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.740
that's what always like like makes my

01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:09.740
brain turn into a balloon animal because I'm like

01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.740
on what you know Norman Lear started

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:13.740
doing sitcoms that were like hey what if

01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:15.740
you know what if what if we treated

01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:17.740
this segment of the

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:19.740
viewing audience as if they also

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.740
were human beings which entails

01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:23.740
something that any on any other

01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.740
day you could go like well that's also

01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:27.740
you know like like it just

01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:29.740
twists my fucking brain and I'll

01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:31.740
go to my grave awkward this is just what awkward

01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:33.740
racially obsessed awkward can't

01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:35.740
fuck up on my grave and I

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:37.740
spend his life trying to figure out

01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:39.740
where the whole all of it is all about the fact

01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:41.740
that we're capable of so much more our brains

01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:43.740
are capable of holding all of it in

01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:45.740
and we don't have to necessarily

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.740
continue to

01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:49.740
generalize to get

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:51.740
wider to understand

01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:53.740
everything on infinite detail we can actually

01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:55.740
stay on macro and

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.740
take everything in at its own

01:25:57.740 --> 01:25:59.740
detail and say you know like

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.740
when Tiger Woods was first becoming a thing

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.740
and he's like look my mom's time

01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:05.740
my dad's black but there's also Mixer's parentage

01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.740
and me of other things so you're telling me

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.740
that you want me to tell you what I am once you just

01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.740
ask me about the golf game and not worry about

01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:13.740
that shit. Which is great that's like why

01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:15.740
the transgender movement might be the

01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:17.740
the Christ of this

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:19.740
you know because

01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:21.740
because there will never be a

01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:23.740
I shouldn't say this is gonna I'm sure this will

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:25.740
get twisted into something inflammatory

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.740
but believe me

01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.740
there will never be

01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:31.740
there will never be such a

01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.740
it's never gonna be like

01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.740
look out the window at all those transgender

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.740
people senator

01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:39.740
like there's gonna be

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.740
I mean there's 700,000

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:43.740
you know

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:45.740
out openly transgender

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.740
people right now and there's you can probably

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:49.740
there's a lot of people I'm just saying like

01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:51.740
we can't keep waiting for this they're like this little tiny

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.740
key that could unravel the whole thing because

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.740
the

01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:57.740
John Oliver just did this

01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.740
piece on his show about the whole

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:01.740
transgender thing and it really just again like flip

01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:03.740
flop my brain about everything because

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:05.740
like we're it's one thing to talk

01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.740
about this culturally but now it's like there's laws

01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.740
they're passing laws in different

01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.740
places that you have to use the bathroom

01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:13.740
that corresponds to the

01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:15.740
genitalia that you were born with

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.740
not the gender that you identify

01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:19.740
with so there and they're

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.740
running ads for like these local

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:23.740
referendums that are like

01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:25.740
they'll show a little girl

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.740
going into a women's room and then

01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.740
a dude with a baseball cap

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.740
and a goatee looking around and then going into

01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:33.740
the women's room after her and saying

01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:35.740
this is what you're voting for

01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:37.740
or this you know because because there's because

01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:39.740
the idea is that if you identify as

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.740
as a the idea is that that guy

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:43.740
in the baseball cap can say

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:45.740
I identify as a woman so I'm gonna go molester

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:47.740
girl in the bathroom like as if that's

01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:49.740
that's the slippery slope we're on and

01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:51.740
my point is like there's like there's

01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:53.740
torturous things happening to people who

01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:55.740
represent really the end all be all

01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:57.740
of like the final thresholds that we

01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.740
really thought we could call thresholds

01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:01.740
and and I think what you're saying

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.740
is that the macro statement like we can

01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:05.740
live in the macro we have the capacity

01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:07.740
for it we're primates we we can do it

01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:09.740
and and the

01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.740
the guy in the four agreements said

01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:13.740
the same thing

01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:15.740
our brains are designed

01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.740
to experience everything

01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:19.740
at the same time we're back our brains

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:21.740
are our brains are not designed

01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:23.740
to have they don't have to always

01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:25.740
have like this this flashlight

01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:27.740
beam that only shines on one

01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:29.740
thing and thinks about one thing at once

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:31.740
we can think a million things at once

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:33.740
and the and we can we can definitely

01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:35.740
think like well like let's

01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:37.740
for instance you could you could you could

01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:39.740
definitely decide as a society

01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:41.740
to go well let's make sure everybody's

01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:43.740
happy like like you could you could

01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:45.740
build that as the bottom foundation

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:47.740
you could build everything else on top of it

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.740
but we're we

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.740
we're living in a world that was created

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:53.740
like so long ago by people that

01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:55.740
didn't even see these days coming when

01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:57.740
these questions could we would have the luxury

01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:59.740
of answer asking these questions but

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.740
but the the I don't know I just got excited

01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:03.740
when you said that because I was thinking about that

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:05.740
piece and like feeling the guilt inside of me

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.740
and going like oh my god well

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.740
like like like that's what this

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:11.740
transgender like concept is

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:13.740
doing to people right now is

01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:15.740
like we're all going

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:17.740
oh I don't know

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:19.740
I've heard myself say out loud

01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:21.740
like oh come on you know

01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:23.740
like about various things like I thought that's

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.740
where you could draw the line like well give me a break

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:27.740
and it's like well we're

01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:29.740
why are you drawing the line there and it's like we'll take that

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.740
line away and take that line away and take that line away

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:33.740
what do you think the worst case scenario is

01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:35.740
where everything is just how people

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.740
want it to be like like

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:39.740
like what what do you think would happen

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.740
and and I just

01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.740
wanted to co-opt what

01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.740
you were saying and turn it into a transgender piece so

01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:47.740
but I feel

01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:49.740
I feel like it's the skeleton key

01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:51.740
it's the redefinition of television one of the things that's

01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:53.740
helped in that because it used

01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:55.740
to be that there were only certain programs

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:57.740
on so there were only certain

01:29:57.740 --> 01:29:59.740
shadings of people that

01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:01.740
you saw and then you would meet

01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:03.740
you'd go out in the world especially your adventurous

01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:05.740
you leave your town and you meet these people

01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:07.740
who whose only experience

01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:09.740
with somebody like you is never

01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:11.740
they've never seen anybody like you but what they relate

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:13.740
to it via generalization is

01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.740
oh Raj

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.740
on what's happening or something like that and I think

01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:19.740
oh this guy must like this and this

01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:21.740
and if I refer I still to this day

01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:23.740
if I go into

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:25.740
a footlock or something this is not to call them out

01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:27.740
but it's happened every time I go in there

01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:29.740
you know and I and I and I just poke

01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:31.740
there and I poke my head in they're like

01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:33.740
how's it going sir how's it going sir hey bro what can I do

01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:35.740
for you and it's and this is not

01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:37.740
you know I'm not this is not

01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.740
literally black and white

01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:41.740
you think

01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:43.740
there was a footlocker I went

01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:45.740
to see a movie and I walked past

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.740
a footlock I didn't go in it and they were giving away

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:49.740
Michael Jordan Cologne

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:51.740
with a bonus prize

01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:53.740
and the guys talking I can hear them in a walk-up

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:55.740
talk to everybody I already know in my head a

01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:57.740
I love Michael Jordan but I'm not going to buy

01:30:57.740 --> 01:30:59.740
a cologne because I have David Beckham's

01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:01.740
cologne but

01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:03.740
but I'm walking past it and a dude

01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:05.740
and the dude it's called

01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:07.740
instinct by the way and it's amazing it has a

01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:09.740
magnetic cap are you wearing it now

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:11.740
no no no I'm wearing a combination of other stuff

01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:13.740
so I walk

01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:15.740
I walk past I walk past it

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:21.740
you're going to give us a breakdown

01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:23.740
it's not on the wrist today

01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:25.740
it's probably it's probably faded

01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:29.740
I think I'm in love

01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:31.740
the guys at the

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:33.740
you should make it back

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:35.740
the guys at the table

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:37.740
turned to me and said

01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:39.740
try Michael Jordan Cologne today

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:41.740
and I just I said guys no I'm not

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:43.740
and before I could finish that

01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:45.740
the one on the end said

01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:47.740
you get a free basketball

01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:49.740
because they were giving away red and black

01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:51.740
Michael Jordan Vassels for the thing and I just looked at it

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:53.740
and I walked over and I go

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:55.740
if you ever in your lifetime ever see me again

01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:57.740
do not speak to me

01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:59.740
or say the word basketball to anybody around

01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:01.740
me within a 300 yard radius

01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:03.740
are you out of your fucking mind and I just sort of walked up

01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:05.740
and that was just my I was just pissed

01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:07.740
it was a rage moment I didn't need to

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:09.740
but you know what that is obviously since it was

01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:11.740
part of a promotion you can you're guaranteed

01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:13.740
you know that they were but they offered nobody

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:15.740
in the walk up to me a basketball

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:17.740
oh they were picking and choosing

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.740
Beverly Center they never

01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:21.740
Beverly Center it was like one of the never

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:23.740
but I'm the last guy in and the basketball became

01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:25.740
part of the incentive and I was just like man

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.740
maybe the word wasn't basketball maybe

01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:29.740
it was free I don't but there's no part

01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:31.740
of that that unlocks the key that makes that right

01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:33.740
I want a free basketball

01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:35.740
it was like you could

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:37.740
I would love a free basketball

01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:39.740
dude get over there

01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:41.740
but you're saying they wouldn't get me one

01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:43.740
they wouldn't offer to you but you would get it

01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:45.740
it's part of the deal

01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:47.740
the cologne would be the thing

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.740
but they didn't put that in the pitch

01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:51.740
not to anybody in the walk up

01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:53.740
the idea would be you can

01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.740
turn down the cologne

01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:57.740
down

01:32:57.740 --> 01:32:59.740
the free basketball

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.740
QED

01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:03.740
it all comes down to dehumanization

01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:05.740
that's always the theme and that's why again

01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:07.740
that's again the skeleton

01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:09.740
key aspect of the transgender thing is because

01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:11.740
it's people going

01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:13.740
I choose

01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:15.740
this even though

01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:17.740
it's difficult for me and all this stuff

01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.740
it's

01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:21.740
it might be our final invitation to

01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:23.740
realize that everything leading up

01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:25.740
to it has always been about dehumanization

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:27.740
whether you're laughing about people being

01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.740
grouped together with certain characteristics

01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:31.740
the final thing is

01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.740
we can do all of that anytime we want

01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:35.740
as long as everybody understands

01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:37.740
that every individual you see

01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:39.740
is always an individual and you can't

01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:41.740
make any assumptions about them

01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:43.740
and it's being hammered into our

01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:45.740
brains and the harder

01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:47.740
the hammer gets pounded the more

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:49.740
I feel myself

01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:51.740
my system goes into a shock and then I relax

01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:53.740
and I'm like oh thanks

01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:55.740
that got hammered in

01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:57.740
keep hammering it and hammering it

01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:59.740
until I can finally look around

01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:01.740
and only see individuals

01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:03.740
and never stop get

01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:05.740
shake this thing where we're thinking like

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.740
well you know the Irish

01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:09.740
and it's like why because it comforts us

01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:11.740
it gives us understanding of a world full of people

01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:13.740
and people scare us and we go like

01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:15.740
you laugh with your friends and go like that fucking Irish

01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:17.740
you know he's Irish

01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:19.740
I thought I was Irish for 20 years

01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:21.740
and I found out I'm fucking British

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:23.740
anyways

01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:25.740
let's move on

01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:27.740
we did our weird springer's

01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:29.740
final thoughts segment of the

01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:31.740
thing

01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:33.740
I wonder if

01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:35.740
in upcoming weeks we're going to see more

01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:37.740
of Ty Brickston

01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:39.740
I hope he comes back to the show

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.740
alright so

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:43.740
and then speaking of

01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:45.740
individuals and dehumanization and stuff

01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:47.740
we've had this ongoing conversation but this is one of those nights

01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:49.740
we've had nothing but men up on stage

01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:51.740
and I think and she doesn't

01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:53.740
this is the important key she doesn't have to play

01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:55.740
Mercy O'Donnell

01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:57.740
necessarily but we should get

01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:59.740
we need one helper up here right

01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:01.740
and I say

01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:03.740
make it a lady with my proactive

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:05.740
campaign

my brother's 20 tattoos

01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:11.740
he regrets none of them

01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:13.740
yes

01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:15.740
when I was 22

I got divorced and I got

01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:19.740
a back tattoo in Japanese it means

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:21.740
freedom

01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:23.740
so yeah one day I'll get it covered

01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:27.740

01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:29.740
yes yes tramp stamp freedom

01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:31.740
I just realized that

01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:33.740
there might be somebody like

01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:35.740
that hasn't seen the show before

01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:37.740
and we haven't explained what we're doing

01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:39.740
these vanilla folders are coming out

01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:41.740
are they gonna eat me

01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:43.740
it's tax time again

01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:47.740
are they gonna start praying and then dip me

01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:49.740
into a cauldron of

01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.740
stew

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:53.740
Darcy you hip to the jive right

you know what our shadow run is right

01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:57.740
vaguely yes I'm a little behind

01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:59.740
because I have a lot of podcasts

01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:01.740

01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:03.740

01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:21.740

01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:27.740
that was fucked up

01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:29.740
I thought he wasn't going to go and right when I did

01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:31.740
he started talking

01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:33.740
he just had the same instinct

01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:35.740
to go right at the right moment

01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:37.740
right yeah the one I was going to go at

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:39.740
I mean it's a natural instinct

01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:43.740
you see you can't

01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:45.740
you can't do it

01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:47.740
last run on Shadow Time

01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:49.740
Harmontown Time Shadow

01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:51.740
we last saw the gang

01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:53.740
at Jim Nightblade's apartment

01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.740
engaged in a standoff with Jesse Yellowman

01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:57.740
Jesse a street samurai

01:38:57.740 --> 01:38:59.740
and the protege of captured

01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:01.740
scientist Baldwin Brown was trying

01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:03.740
to convince the team

01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:05.740
to forfeit their pay data

01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:07.740
warning of dire consequences if they

01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:09.740
failed to do so

01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:11.740
Nightblade fired his grappling gun out the window

01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:13.740
for no reason and then a firefighting

01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:15.740
sued Hordegaard

01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:17.740
was able to subdue Jesse with a blast

01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:19.740
of shock ammo from his rifle allowing

01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:21.740
the team to tie up the incapacitated

01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:23.740
vigilante for

01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:25.740
delivery to their mysterious Johnson

01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:27.740
then Eve Liberteam started

01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:29.740
operating landscaping equipment

01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:31.740
and farting because this show is improvised

01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:33.740
will the team

01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:35.740
manage to get paid or will their

01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:37.740
employer double cross them

01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:39.740
find out dot dot dot

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:41.740
now dot

01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:45.740
thank you Spencer

01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:47.740
yeah man

01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:53.740
and thanks again to John from LA

01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:55.740
as always I spent

01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.740
the recap going like

01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:59.740
did I talk about race too much

01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:01.740
so I didn't listen at all

01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:03.740
so I have no idea what

01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:05.740
we took Jesse Yellowman

01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:07.740
captives to give him to our

01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:09.740
Johnson as a show of good faith

01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:11.740
oh we got him

01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:13.740
he's knocked down and tied up yeah

01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:15.740
so let's take him

01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.740
back to the Johnson and say

01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:19.740
this is what happens

01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.740
sometimes people offer us more money

01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:23.740
to

01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:25.740
double cross you we're saying

01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:27.740
fuck that shit we got the guy

01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:29.740
seven voices gone

01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:31.740
hey uh

01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:33.740
you know

01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:35.740
two things occur to me

01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:37.740
one is

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:39.740
is this gonna be about race

01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:41.740
no it's like 2075

01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:43.740
I'm like

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:45.740
30% Cherokee

01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:47.740
30

01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:51.740
uh

01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:53.740
the uh

01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:55.740
30

01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:57.740
um

01:40:57.740 --> 01:40:59.740
it skips a generation

01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:05.740
one is the simple code of the street samurai

01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:07.740
which says you know this guy kind of

01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:09.740
I took a tried to stun him and he

01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:11.740
was faster and

01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:13.740
kind of feel like a chump bringing him in

01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:15.740
the other is

01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:19.740
he's talking a lot of stuff about how

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:21.740
the stakes are

01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:23.740
kind of big

01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:25.740
he's saying

01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:27.740
we're dealing with something like

01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:29.740
I don't know man I keep going back and forth

01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:31.740
about this I guess I'm not really a good

01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:33.740
shadow runner or a good

01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:35.740
thinker

01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:39.740
maybe we could split the diff

01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:41.740
and set the guy free without

01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:43.740
totally fucking him over

01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:45.740
our rationale was that we got to do our job

01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:47.740
but this ain't our job

01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:49.740
you know turn and snitch on a fucking

01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:51.740
fellow

01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:53.740
shatter

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:55.740
here's a pitch why don't we take him

01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:57.740
and leave him somewhere safe

01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:59.740
with a little note like we write a little

01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.740
note that says like we could have turned

01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:03.740
you over we didn't

01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:05.740
like a warning

01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:07.740
yeah like

01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.740
we're not gonna turn you in and get you in trouble

01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:11.740
but you know

01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:13.740
leave it be

01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:15.740
and let him know that we were cool about it

01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:17.740
why don't we take a look at some of these files

01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:19.740
with somebody that knows what they mean you know too

01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:21.740
I agree with that but also let's take a look

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:23.740
at what we're handing over to the man

01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:25.740
nobody said we couldn't do that

01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:27.740
you know what I'm saying

01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:29.740
what files

01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:31.740
I'm sorry the files we got from

01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:33.740
Baldwin Brown yeah let's check him out

01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:35.740
okay somebody smart

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:37.740
here

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:39.740
mercy mercy you're smart

01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:41.740
oh yes

01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:43.740
let me look at these files that I have

01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:45.740
what the fuck is in the files

01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:47.740
they're on a data chip

01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:49.740
you find it's encrypted

01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:51.740
some high level stuff it's gonna take

01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.740
a real hacker to figure this out

01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:55.740
we need a hack guy

01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:57.740
is hack guy with us

01:42:57.740 --> 01:42:59.740
no

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:01.740
hack guy can we

01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:03.740
hack guy's not with us

01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:05.740
talking to him on the phone

01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:07.740
oh you got him

01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:09.740
you guys talk to him I talk too much

01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:11.740
let mercy talk to him

01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:13.740
hack guy hey what's up

01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:15.740
how you doing

01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:17.740
where are you at

01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:19.740
I'm at home

01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:21.740
oh cool

01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:23.740
so

01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:25.740
where's home at

01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:27.740
where are we in relation to your home

01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:29.740
don't worry about that

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:31.740
what do you need

01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:33.740
we need to unencrypt these files

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.740
yeah can I can I send you

01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:37.740
a file then man because we gotta

01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:39.740
unencrypt this stuff and it's really really important

01:43:39.740 --> 01:43:41.740
yeah just upload it

01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:43.740
to the matrix

01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:45.740
hold on

01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:47.740
a joke

01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:49.740
Porta God would argue against taking

01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:51.740
the secret files that we have

01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:53.740
gone through so much trouble to acquire and then

01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:55.740
just making them open to everyone to see

01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:59.740
what I would might suggest is that if you

01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:01.740
can convince him to be a minimal to the idea

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:03.740
perhaps we could either arrange to have

01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:05.740
a car sent to him if he could give the specific details

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:07.740
and digits of what he needs

01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:09.740
otherwise I could possibly track his location

01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:11.740
using some sort of combination

01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:13.740
of skills and

01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:15.740
mechanisms that I have otherwise

01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:17.740
but we could get him and bring him

01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:19.740
to us

01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:21.740
who are you talking to

01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:23.740
I'm speaking to the group

01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:25.740
as they suggest into my

01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:27.740
colleagues we're sending him an

01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:29.740
encrypted file right like

01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:31.740
that's not safe to send over the matrix

01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:33.740
well there are other encryptors in the world

01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:35.740
you're being really uptight about this

01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:37.740
this is my job in my lineage

01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:39.740
alright alright let's get him

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:41.740
let's get him a car I mean we need it now

01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:43.740
is he amenable to the idea

01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:45.740
I can meet you at Hank's Last Stand

01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:47.740
alright let's do it

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:49.740

you arrive at Hank's

01:44:57.740 --> 01:44:59.740
Last Stand at the Hall of Justice

01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:01.740
you file

01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:03.740
out of the Uber and into the dark

01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:05.740
comfort of the old

01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:07.740
moldy bar you see Hank

01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:09.740
cleaning his glass as usual

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:11.740
hot or a hot guy not hot guy

01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:13.740
hot guy

01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:15.740
is in the corner his corner

01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:17.740
his usual corner waiting

01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:19.740
well we never discussed what we were

01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:21.740
going to do with pink pink pink

01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:23.740

I mean

01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:29.740

01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:31.740
right

01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:33.740
did we crack a window for him

01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:35.740
my pitch

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:37.740
would have been let's restrain

01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:39.740
him and put him in the trunk

01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:41.740
yeah

01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:43.740
of the Uber

01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:45.740
oh shit yeah it's an Uber

01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:47.740
we put him in the trunk of the Uber

01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:49.740
we say to the driver leave the meter running

01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:51.740
yeah okay that works

01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:53.740
yeah

01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:55.740
right mercy go talk

01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:01.740
your talk

01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:03.740

because we've got

01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:15.740
this data excuse

01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:17.740
me we've got this data chip

01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:19.740
and we need it unencrypted

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:21.740
yeah you do

01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:23.740

01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:25.740
I'll take it I'll take a look at it

01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.740
so

01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:29.740

I don't know it seems like you guys are getting a little flirty

01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:37.740
this is my bedroom voice

01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:45.740
I go to the jukebox and put on some sexy

01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:47.740
R&B

01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:49.740
and I'm at the bar with Dr. Friend

01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:51.740
and

01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:53.740
and I just I go

01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.740
so what do you make of all this shadow running

01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:01.740
I don't know man

01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:03.740
I have to tell you

01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:05.740
as long as I do no harm

01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:07.740
I'm okay

01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:09.740
it's got to become increasingly hard in this world

01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.740
it's

01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:13.740
it's becoming increasingly hard now

01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:15.740
especially with

01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:17.740
I

01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:19.740
turn the music up on the sexy R&B

01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:25.740
there are a lot of things I haven't talked

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:27.740
about with you

01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:29.740
listen it's getting it's getting

01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:31.740
really hard for me too

01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:33.740
so you can you can trust

01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:35.740
me talk to me

01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:41.740
hey man I'm like

01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:43.740
you I don't think you are

01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:45.740
man I don't think you have

01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:47.740
a clue I used to be legit

01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:49.740
I fell down to this world

01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:51.740
fell from grace lost my wings

01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:53.740
oh no

01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:55.740
I thought you meant about me being gay

01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:03.740
Hordergaard

01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:05.740
Hordergaard goes to the jukebox

01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:07.740
and plays the next selection

01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:09.740
which is Luto Van Dros

01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:13.740
never enough

01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:15.740
well I mean

01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:17.740
look if we're going there

01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:19.740
on the Kinsey scale

01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:21.740
truth be told

01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:25.740
I call myself 50-50

01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:31.740
I'm a little more than that

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.740
you know we've been going

01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:37.740
on these shadow runs for a long time

01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:39.740
I've been keeping everything

01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.740
kind of low but

01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:43.740
I have to tell you that I'm

01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:45.740
dealing with feelings about you

01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:47.740
oh shit

01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:49.740
I mean you in particular

01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:53.740
I'm just telling you you don't have to say anything

01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:55.740
I'm just letting you know

01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.740
I appreciate your transparency

01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:01.740
I figured you should know

01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:03.740
please don't tell anybody it's just between us

01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:07.740
of course respect nothing more than privacy

01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:09.740
that's why I got into this business

01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:17.740
do you know I'm a precog

01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:19.740
I can sense your look

01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:21.740
and everything about it

01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:23.740
what are you guys talking about over there

01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:25.740
I'm wondering how it has to mission

01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:31.740
how are you guys still working on it

01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:33.740
have we found anything out yet

01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:35.740
oh yeah I'm just pouring through this data

01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:37.740
seriously

01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:39.740
I guess we're all pouring through a lot of data

01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:45.740
gently nightblade

01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:47.740
gently

01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:49.740
what does it say

01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:51.740
it says all sorts of stuff

01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:53.740
it talks about BTL chips

01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:55.740
those hot new drugs that kids are using

01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:57.740
these days

01:49:57.740 --> 01:49:59.740
talks about the mechanisms by which they

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:01.740
damage and degrade the neural pathways

01:50:01.740 --> 01:50:03.740
of your brain and it looks like Baldwin Brown

01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:05.740
has been doing some research on how to reverse

01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:07.740
that damage

01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:09.740
we're talking crazy BTLs

01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:11.740
imagine if you could just do mountains of cocaine

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:13.740
all day and wake up fresh as a daisy

01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:15.740
that's what they're bringing

01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:17.740
that's what this research is about

01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:19.740
no downsides

01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:21.740
to drugs

01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:23.740
so somebody who had these files

01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:25.740
could either you know I mean

01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:27.740
what's the I don't know

01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:31.740
it sounds like if you're

01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:33.740
moving the bad side

01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:35.740
of a dangerous drug

01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:37.740
I don't really see a downside

01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:39.740
to giving it to Baldwin Brown

01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:41.740
no it seems pretty standard

01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:43.740
you just fix these neural pathways in the brain

01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:45.740
and everything's healthy

01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:47.740
I guess the question is

01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:53.740
the people that we give this information to

01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:55.740
do they want it because they want to use it

01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:57.740
or suppress it

01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:01.740
or just do it

01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:05.740
cliffhanger

01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:11.740
thank you Darcy

01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:13.740
Darcy everybody

01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:19.740
DeMorge Brown

01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:23.740
Curtis Armstrong

01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:25.740
Spencer Crittenden

01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:31.740
Ty Brickston

01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:33.740
the embittered three foot tall

01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:35.740
promoter

01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:37.740
I'm Jeff Davis

01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:39.740
your mayor Dan Harmon

01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:49.740
thank you all

01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:51.740
dry fast

01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:53.740
did you get any of that

01:51:53.740 --> 01:52:21.740
it's a good show
