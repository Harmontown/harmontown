{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:09.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the NerdMelt Theater, Harmontown is now in\n\n00:09.000 --> 00:10.000\nsession.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:20.000\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:29.000\nThank you.\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:31.000\nThank you so much.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:32.000\nSuch kind people.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:34.000\nYou're such warm hearted, supportive people.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:36.000\nYou put a lot of faith in me.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:39.000\nI don't want to let you down.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:41.000\nBut it won't be a good show tonight.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:43.000\nIt's not going to be a good show.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:44.000\nWhy is that?\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:45.000\nI'm busy.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:47.000\nAnd I'm tired.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:49.000\nAnd I'm not very talented.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:52.000\nAnd I don't make plans.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:55.000\nAnd then I come up on stage and it's like, what am I going to talk about?\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:56.000\nI don't know what I'm going to talk about.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:58.000\nIn case why, Dan, I disagree with you about tonight's show.\n\n00:58.000 --> 00:59.000\nI think it's going to be a good one.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:02.000\nBecause tonight you're drinking out of glass as opposed to a red solo cup.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:07.000\nAnd I think that automatically steps up the class factor.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:09.000\nI think I wrote one thing in my notepad.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:13.000\nSee, I knew it.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:14.000\nLet's see.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:17.000\nOh, there is a surprise later tonight.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:21.000\nI'm going to take this dick out.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:23.000\nBy the way, Dan, while you're looking that up,\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:25.000\npeople that play music and like music,\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:28.000\nbecause we can't play licensed music anymore,\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:31.000\nI have to play stuff that people either donate to us or that is free\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nso that we don't get in trouble now that we're charging people.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:36.000\nSo if you want to or you know somebody that plays music\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:39.000\nand wants to play something kick-ass to start off the show,\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:43.000\ngo to Harmontownmusic.tumblr.com\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:48.000\nand all the info will be there to have a song that we can play to start off the show\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:49.000\nand play throughout the show.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:51.000\nSo if you know somebody, please give it.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:55.000\nBecause that song is by a band called Knife to Meet You.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:57.000\nOh.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\nKnife.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:01.000\nReal Knife.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:04.000\nReal Knife.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:10.000\nYeah, that's Harold Knife and his girlfriend Cindy Meats.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:14.000\nSee?\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:16.000\nCindy Meats?\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:17.000\nYou thought I was being self-deprecating.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nI'm just a journalist.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nWhy are you so tired, Harmon?\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:22.000\nI'm working.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:24.000\nI'm going to go back to the office after this.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:27.000\nI'm locking episode 604.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:29.000\nTake us to the last 48 hours of your life.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:30.000\nWhat have you done?\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:35.000\nWell, I went to Yahoo in San Jose over the weekend.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:37.000\nThey had us come out.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:38.000\nI think it was Friday.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:44.000\nWe went and flew to San Jose and then drove to this weird spaceship\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:49.000\nin the middle of the desert where these thousands and thousands of Yahoo people\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:52.000\nlike work and it's crazy over there.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:57.000\nAnd they had, you know, it was just like a sort of like a drop into there.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:02.000\nThey have like a fireside chat every Friday where the CEO, Marissa Meyer,\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:06.000\nlike conducts this like whole thing and you can Reddit style.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:11.000\nYou can like type in, I think, anonymous questions and they get upvoted or downvoted.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:16.000\nIt's sort of like a closed circuit Reddit for AMA that she does every week.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:19.000\nSo if you have like a beef with your paycheck or something,\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nyou can like, like, what the fuck's with my paycheck?\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:24.000\nAnd if everyone's like, yeah, what the fuck's up with the paycheck?\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nAnd she'll be like, what the fuck's up with the paycheck?\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nOkay, so here's the thing.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:32.000\nYou don't get one, but listen, I don't know.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\nYou get a free email address.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:38.000\nLook under your seat.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nAnd so it's like that.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:44.000\nSo they have like guests that are like people that work at different departments\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:49.000\ncome up and do this thing and it's all like a big kind of pump you up Yahoo thing.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:51.000\nAnd they have purple beer.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:54.000\nI'm boring myself.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nThe purple beer is really good.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nI have nothing bad to say about Yahoo.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:01.000\nIs it purple for a reason or is it just dyed purple because it's called...\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:03.000\nWell, it's made with blueberries or something.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nSo I think there's some purple that's justified,\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:09.000\nbut I think overall probably they just put cancerous dye in it, right?\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:14.000\nI mean, I don't think anything that's supposed to be a color is ever that color.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nIs Yahoo your employer of putting cancer in their beer?\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:19.000\nYes.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:22.000\nI'm just saying like when things are orange because you feel like they should be orange,\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nthey're not usually orange.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nLike cheddar cheese or something.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:30.000\nYeah, like, you know, we rarely, you know, see things the way...\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:35.000\nSomebody told me that air conditioning, in the air conditioning industry,\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:40.000\nlike there's a worldwide conspiracy to make the 69 degrees in your car\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\neither warmer or colder than real 69 degrees\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:48.000\nbecause human beings have a certain temperature that they think is 69 degrees\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:52.000\nand it doesn't match what's real 69 degrees.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:57.000\nSomebody told me that when we were doing the AC repair things in community.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:02.000\nAnyways, our movie was just broke on Netflix,\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:07.000\nand you can tell because, yes, please, Netflix is here.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:12.000\nI mean, is that why you're drinking out of a glass?\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:16.000\nWell, you can tell from the volume of tweets of people saying,\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:19.000\nI just watched the Harmontown documentary kind of really shot up.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:24.000\nI don't think Netflix is, I think they've got a real sizable lemonade stand going over there.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:30.000\nI think they might be flixing some nets.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:36.000\nI think they might have some viewership that Netflix.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:42.000\nIs Sydney Meats there?\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nSydney Meats.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:48.000\nAlright, so are you almost through the woods with a community?\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nAre you almost through with the writing?\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:55.000\nWhy don't you play the family song?\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nFamily song?\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:02.000\nI'll get my own.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:10.000\nFrom the day I went to you, I knew it was true\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:17.000\nAnd I saw your eyes and you knew what you saw was true\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:24.000\nFamily, you are what we need\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:28.000\nPut your bomb in the body, in the body, in the shoe\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:33.000\nFuck you, mama\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:40.000\nFamily, put your bomb in the bucket, in the bucket, in the shoe\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:44.000\nFamily, family is where you are\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:49.000\nPut your bomb in the bucket, in the body, in the shoe\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:54.000\nOh, wait, wait, wait\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:57.000\nWas MC John about to come out?\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nSeemed like it, seemed like it.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nYou gotta start over though.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:05.000\nBut here's the thing with that song though, it starts right on the nugget\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nAnd then I start a measure in, I don't know, do you call it a measure?\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nA bar, yeah.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nYou can tell from the music that I'm a bar off, you know what I mean?\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nBecause I'm like doing my set up.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nIt goes like one, two, three, four, it starts right on the one.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nSo that's a toughie.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nWhoever wrote that song, you failed.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nLet it go four or eight bars before you jump in.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nReally?\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nSo go like, yeah, just hype it up for a bit.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nOkay, so it's like, so you start it.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:33.000\nOkay, let's try it out.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.000\nOkay.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:40.000\nYeah, alright, here we go.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:41.000\nReady?\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nCheck it out.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:45.000\nOh, so I start there?\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:46.000\nOkay, try it.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:49.000\nI thought four would be like four or two more.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nYou could do four or eight.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nSo as long as it's two, as a factor of two, I'm okay.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nI mean, you want to start at the end of a measure, right?\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nOkay, because it just seems, okay, let's try it.\n\n07:58.000 --> 07:59.000\nLet me try it.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:00.000\nOkay, you ready?\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.000\nOkay, here we go.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:09.000\nEight, one, two, three, four, five, six.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:15.000\nWhen the morning sun comes up, I go to school.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nSee?\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:17.000\nNo, see?\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nYou hear that?\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:19.000\nNo, did you hear it?\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nDid you hear it?\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\nLike, it didn't like a little resolvey thing.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:22.000\nNo, no, no, you were right in it.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:23.000\nYou were right in it.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nNo, but it was, I said, go to school.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nAnd it was like, like it was like, you're done.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nLike, you're done with that thought.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nOkay, then let it go, let it turn it all the way around there.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nIt's four?\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nOkay, let's hear it.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nFor four?\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nOkay.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:44.000\nOkay, yeah, you can fill that time with some music.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:57.000\nWhen I go to school, I like to learn.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:06.000\nBut think about the things you should not burn.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:09.000\nOkay, let's do it again.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:10.000\nHow about this?\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:11.000\nHow about this?\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:14.000\nWhen it starts, just start.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\nLet's try that, but I'm not always going to be able to do that.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:18.000\nEven if it's just see if that works.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nEven if it's bullshit.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nLike, you're like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:23.000\nAll right, I'll just jump in.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nI'm never going to, you know, okay.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nOkay, so go ahead, try it.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nThe question, do you want a topic?\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nNo, this is about joy.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:35.000\nThis song makes me happy.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nI just sing from my heart.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:40.000\nKevin MacLeod, if you're out there, come to Harmontown and visit the show\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nbecause he's really become a celebrity.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.000\nI think we all agree that this is the greatest song of all time.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:50.000\nSo now, the thing is, as soon as this kicks in, just dive in.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nI can even try to count you in.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nA one, two, a three, a four.\n\n09:54.000 --> 10:10.000\nWith the summer, spring, and seasons of fall, I can go a whole year without lovin' it all.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:21.000\nSpiders inside of me, leprechauns on the right of me, scary things all around, running through the cemetery.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:25.000\nOh boy, it's very scary. I've got to get to ground round.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nIt's a restaurant in the Midwest.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:31.000\nFamily, you pay what you weigh.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:32.000\nGround round.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:33.000\nPay what you weigh.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:38.000\nIt's a mean thing to do to affect you today.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:44.000\nCommentary on the ground round threw me off meter.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nI have big fat John.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nI'm MC John's brother.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:55.000\nI'm anxious about my weight, and I'm not as good a rapper.\n\n10:55.000 --> 11:00.000\nThank you.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:04.000\nWhen you go down to the house, you bring a key.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nBeep, beep, toot, toot.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:09.000\nBring a key to your house and you get your loot.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:14.000\nI want to go inside for you.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:17.000\nBeep, beep, beep, toot, toot, toot.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:21.000\nFamily, you are all of me.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nBeep, beep, toot, toot.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nBring a key to your house and you get your loot.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nWhat is our show?\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:33.000\nWhat are we doing?\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nOkay, you're right.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:39.000\nIf you were a new viewer, you would be upset.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nOne thing for certain, that was certainly about joy.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:46.000\nI have some questions about big fat John, MC John's brother.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:49.000\nWhy are they both named John?\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:52.000\nI think that his parents were like...\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nAre they full siblings or stepbrothers?\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:59.000\nI think that Big Fat John, I think they're full on genetic siblings,\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:02.000\nbut their parents are just so mean.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:05.000\nBig Fat John got born and they're like, let's try again.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:08.000\nOh, so MC John's the younger brother?\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:12.000\nYeah, and Big Fat John is like first and then they were just like laid him aside\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nand they said, you're going to watch us do this right.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nWait.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nThe parents made...\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:23.000\nHow old was MC John when they made him watch the parents have sex again?\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nFive.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nSo he's five years old.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nThe parents say, watch us fuck.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nWe're going to build a new John.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nA good one, an MC.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nThey didn't know he was going to be fat.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nNo, Big Fat John's watching.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nThey're building MC John.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:40.000\nDid they hope that he would be an MC or is that just an accident?\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.000\nYeah, I think they wanted to make an MC.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nOr a lawn keeper.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nYou can make that change.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nThey wanted him to be a...\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nMaybe it's a family of gardeners.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nSo then the irony is that Big Fat John was like, you're too fat to garden.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nWe're going to make a great John.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\nThen they made a John that was a good MC,\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:02.000\nbut who is like, he toes the family line.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:05.000\nLike he's like, I like to mow the lawn, but really he's an MC.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nI don't know.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nIs that too complicated?\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nIs Big Fat John at heart a better gardener than MC John?\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nMaybe our heart goes out to Big Fat John.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:18.000\nHe's the dinklage of this Game of Thrones.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:26.000\nWe all know what it feels like to be a misfit and not loved.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:31.000\nI mean, I admire his courage to even step into the rapping milieu.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nWell, I think he was thrust into it.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nI think that was actually a really awkward situation.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nSomeone mistook him for his brother and shoved him in and he was like,\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:39.000\nI'm Big Fat John, I don't rap.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nI think that was sad.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nIs he much fatter?\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nIs he so fat?\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nNo, he's a regular size.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:50.000\nIt's just a horrible world with a bad body image.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:53.000\nLike a regular sized person with a normal metabolism.\n\n13:53.000 --> 14:01.000\nHe just has grown up in a world of Cindy Crawford billboards dating myself.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nWhoever your Cindy Crawford is, hologram Crawford.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nThis new generation.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nCindy Meat.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:15.000\nIt's probably a porpoise, fucking weirdos.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nHave you got a new porn fetish?\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:21.000\nIt used to be like...\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nYeah, I got married and then I was just like,\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:27.000\nI'm going to scratch some new itches.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:32.000\nI don't mean like, is it still stockings and nipples, rubbings and things like that?\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nMannequins and nipple rubbings.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nFirst of all, everyone likes their nipples rubbed.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:39.000\nI don't like my nipples rubbed.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nRub them right.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nWhy don't you come over and rub my nipples?\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nI don't want to rub your nipples.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:49.000\nOne time I was wearing some socks that were like sheer.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nAnd I showed you them and you touched them and you were like,\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nWhoa!\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nBecause you were like, what am I doing?\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nThis is my thing.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nI like to rub stockings.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nOh, you were wearing socks that were like kind of nylon-y.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nAnd you were like, whoa, what the hell?\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:05.000\nYeah, that's a tricky one.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:09.000\nI get mad when people wear things and I'm like,\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:13.000\noh, that's my fetish, but you're not my wife.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:19.000\nAnd also, you work in a bank.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nSo what's the look?\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.000\nWhat's the what?\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nWhat's the look? What's the outfit?\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nI don't know.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nIt could be anything.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nWhat do you mean? What's the look?\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nYou said that you see somebody wearing something.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:34.000\nNo, I'm saying I see a little bit of leg with any kind of nylon on it.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nI'm not saying like I see a outfit.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nI'm saying like the fetish is for...\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nIt's simply legs and nylons.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nYeah.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nI feel like we've been over it and I feel like we're not making,\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nyou know, we're not making progress,\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nbut we're talking about this.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:50.000\nI feel like we're near a break through right now.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nNo.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nIt's just a thing.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nEverybody's got buttons, right?\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:59.000\nYou guys have buttons, little sexual buttons.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nYou know who I envy?\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:05.000\nThese people who get turned down by bare legs, high heels, big tits,\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nand like a can of beer.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:10.000\nBecause it's clearly their planet.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:15.000\nYou're like driving down the street and it's like,\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:19.000\nhey, big bank theory is on five nights a week\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nand it's like some ironic thing of like a woman going,\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:25.000\nooh, big bank theory and there's a can of beer between her tits.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nI don't know why I'm throwing big bank theory under the bus.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nI just mean like any product that would be like,\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nlike where the joke is that it's supposed to be sexual,\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nbut like I look at it and I go, well, that's not sexual.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nThat's like a parody of sexuality,\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.000\nbut there are some people in the world who are like,\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:43.000\nfunny joke, plus I'm jerking off.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:46.000\nBecause I also, you know, there's a lot of stuff that I'm like,\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nlike I'm sure people, like I've said on the podcast,\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nlike there's people would,\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nif they were walking past it on the street,\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nthey'd be like, that's nothing.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:54.000\nThat's a fire hydrant.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:58.000\nAnd I'd be like, that's my jam.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nI was telling you backstage that I was at a party last night\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:01.000\nthat was very pansexual.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nIt was kind of all over the shop and there was a,\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nthere's people that were trans and also like,\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:06.000\nI don't know the words.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:07.000\nI will get them all wrong.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nI don't know all the names for things that people are\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nor don't want to be called or whatever.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nBut a friend of mine who is gay,\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:17.000\nbut he is a man, but he's into other men,\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:20.000\nbut he wants, he likes to date straight men\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nbecause he wants men.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nThose are colored people.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nYou said you don't know the phrases.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:27.000\nThat's colored people.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:31.000\nColored people?\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:34.000\nDid they change that?\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nAre you my grandma?\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nMy grandma, look at the one,\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:38.000\nshe was the nicest lady in the world,\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:41.000\nbut she looked at the one that was colored people.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nMy grandparents too, but they were taught,\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nthat was their African-American.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nAnd we've kind of, we, you know, we always do that.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nLike we, in the 90s,\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nlike the African-American thing was trotted out.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nIt was never, it was never retracted,\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nbut like I think there might be a,\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\nI don't even, for all I know it's now,\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:58.000\nI haven't even checked in on this, and how would you?\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nRemember when Kramer was apologizing\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:03.000\nfor his little meltdown on Letterman,\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:06.000\nand he called black people Afro-Americans?\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nLike, and it was like this really weird striking thing.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:12.000\nI mean like what, well colored people was introduced,\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nit was supposed to be like, you know,\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:17.000\nit was like a, it was supposed to be a healthy thing.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nThe National Association for whatever the blah blah blah\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\ncolored people has colored people right in their name.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nAdvancement, advancement, I know what it is.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:28.000\nI mean, it's like, it was a fine thing.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nAnd then we're like, oh, grandma,\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:33.000\nbut she's like saying it, she's trying to do it right.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nShe's like, oh, there's a color gentleman.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nLike, I remember, yeah, it's funny,\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:38.000\nour grandma's generation.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nSo my friend says, he goes like,\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:43.000\nI want men to treat me like a lady.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\nBut he's not a woman, he's a guy,\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nbut he wants, he likes straight men.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nI'm like, wait, so what?\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nYour last boyfriend was a straight guy?\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:51.000\nHe goes, yeah.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:52.000\nHe goes, my last boyfriend was straight.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nAnd I go, did you guys fuck?\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nHe goes, yeah, all the time.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nAnd I was like, wait, how does that work?\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nAnd he goes, he goes, ain't no fag\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\ngoing to fuck me like that.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nI'm like, that's fucking fascinating.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:07.000\nAnd so he prefers straight dick to gay dick,\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:10.000\nbut it seems like it's pretty gay dick too.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.000\nFucking god.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:14.000\nA lot of us say, as with the,\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:17.000\nI think that's the Heisenberg principle.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:21.000\nIf you can observe a straight dick in a gay\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:25.000\nbutt or mouth, the moment you have\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nobserved it as straight, it becomes gay.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:32.000\nBut that's straight talk.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:35.000\nThat's heteronormative psychology.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nHe should know better.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nHe's the expert when he's being fucked\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nby a straight guy and when he's being\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:41.000\nfucked by a gay guy.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nThe customer's always right, man.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\nIt's up to him what he wants to call\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nhis customers, yeah.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:49.000\nBut I mean, that's the thing like,\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nwhat was I going to say?\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nProbably something inflammatory and dated\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nand clumsy.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nWere you still talking about color people?\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nNo, no, I wasn't going to talk about\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\ncolor people.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nColor people, they're on their own.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nThe world's become too complicated.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:05.000\nColor people, you're on your own.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:10.000\nThe, what was it about sexuality?\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:11.000\nI'm trying to remember.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:12.000\nI was thinking of something when\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:13.000\nyou were talking about that.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nI just like the fact that, you know,\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nas we grew up, I think we've talked\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nabout this a bit.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nAnd of course, very poorly educated\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nconversations about it is that,\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nwe grew up, like it was this, that,\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nor the other.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nThere was only kind of three or four\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\ncrayolas in that box.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nNow there's a bunch, which is great.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.000\nBut I just don't know, like I don't\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nreally have the vocabulary for it.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nAlso, there was this switch, which I\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\ntotally understand, but it was a\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\ndefinite switch from our generation\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nto this new generation, which is that\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:41.000\nnow you're supposed to, you're supposed\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:46.000\nto ask a little bit, which in our day\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nbecause there was only so many things\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nand being different just got you beat\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nup.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nAnd I kind of tried to broach this\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nwith, when Curtis was here, we were\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\ntalking about Revenge of the Nerds,\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nwhich he totally, you know, like,\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nyou watch that movie, and it's like,\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nyeah, politically correct, through\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nthe politically correct lens, there's\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\na, that movie now commits more crimes\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nthan it ever solved.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:07.000\nBut, but, but the, but the interesting\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nthing about when you watch that movie\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:10.000\nis that you can, if you want to\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nunderstand like the Gen X, like,\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nconcept of political correctness and\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:17.000\nprogress, all we, all we ever understood\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:20.000\nwas going from bullying, going from\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:23.000\nbigotry to dropping that.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nAnd so when you watch like these 80s\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nmovies where like underdogs are the\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nnew heroes, what you're seeing is a\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nlot of, for lack of a better word,\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nignorance, like, like ignoring what\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nmakes people different.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nSo like, you see like, just unlikely\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nfamilies and one of them's gay and one\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:40.000\nof them, but they don't make gay jokes.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nThey don't beat him up for being gay,\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nso he's one of the family.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nAnd then this guy smokes pot and they\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\ndon't, they don't, they smoke pot with\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nhim and it's just like, it's, they're\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:50.000\nall put in this big pot.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nAnd that's the Gen X version of\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nprogress, is that we stop, we stop\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nhurting each other.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nAnd, and so if you, and that's when I\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nran into trouble, you know, recently\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nor a couple, couple months ago, six\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nmonths ago now, it was when my friend\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:07.000\nJane was up, who's, who's, who's\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:08.000\nEarthshined, you said you brought to\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nthat party and it was a big hit.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nJane should know that.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nI have to, Jane's not here, I don't\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nimagine, but I have to get, Jane, if\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:15.000\nyou're listening, I have to get in\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:16.000\ntouch with you because I brought\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nyour, your absence to a party and it\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nwas everybody's favorite thing and\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:21.000\nI'm being tweeted about it a lot because\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\neverybody got stoned to the tits on\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:24.000\nthe fucking absence.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nIt was very good.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nI was drunk and I used the wrong\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\npronoun a thousand times with her\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nbecause I, he's present, she was\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\npresenting very male and I was just,\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nI was just drunk and whatever.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nBut, and then someone complained on\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nTwitter and then I did not ingratiate\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:41.000\nmyself to the community with my\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nresponse, which was like, if that's\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nwhat you took away from their podcast,\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:47.000\nyou are too sensitive or whatever,\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nthey're like, ah!\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:52.000\nBut, but, but the interesting take\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\naway that I took from, from all of\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nthat was like, you know, there's,\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nif you use that as a yardstick, like\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nway out there, this like crazy new\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:03.000\nworld, the word crazy offensive now,\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nbut, but in reference to some of the\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nstuff, but, but, but like, you're\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nactually supposed to now explore and\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:12.000\nask, which was like, kind of like,\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:15.000\ngoes back to like, 60's and 70's\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nkind of, like when we were at a high\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nof our like, Norman Lear kind of\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\ndriven like, let's end racism, but\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nthen like, the 80's, 90's and things\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nkind of ushered in this world of like,\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.000\nyou know what, put your hands in your\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:28.000\npockets, look at the ground, and as\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nlong as you're not hurting anybody,\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nyou're, you're, you're actually like\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nfor progress, and it's like, the way\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nI put it was like, when I was a kid on\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nthe playground, anybody that like,\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:39.000\nasked you if you're a boy or a girl,\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:42.000\nor what you preferred to be, that was\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\ncalled a bully, it was like, I was\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nasked that a lot, I was asked if I was\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nstraight or gay, I was asked if I was\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\na boy or a girl, I was asked why I don't\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nshower, I was asked, I was asked all\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nkinds of questions, and they were not,\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nthey were not fun questions to be asked\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nand I was, I was not happy to be asked\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nthem, and the answers were not going to\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nmake anyone happy, and there were, no one\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nwas seeking any actual answers, and so\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nthere's a kind of a psychology there\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nwhere you go, I, I'm going to be a hip\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nmodern person when I grow up, and I'm\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\ngoing to like, I'm not going to, I'm\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\ngoing to go with the flow, and then now\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nwe're entering this new world, we're going\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nwith the flow all of a sudden, now we're\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nthe, we can end up being the, the tide\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nof, of bigotry, but I'm going with the flow.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:35.000\nHa, fart corner, when you want the fart corner to start on the second bar,\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nwhat's his name, Richard Jenkins, who made that\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:45.000\nsong? Academy Award winner, Kevin McLeod.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:48.000\nKevin McLeod, there can be only two,\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:51.000\nmake another version of that song with\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\na little bar, a little, give me a little\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:56.000\nramp, Kevin, and if your head comes away from\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:59.000\nyour neck, it's over, where's the camera?\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nWhere's the camera when that red light\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\ngoes off, and then there's no red light\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nanywhere? It goes to another camera behind you.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nOh, there's a camera behind us? No, if you're\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:08.000\nlooking there, the red light will go on\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nsomewhere else, see it's an ounce over there.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nNow it's up there.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nNow it's going to be over there.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:18.000\nHoly ground, Highlander.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nAll right.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:23.000\nOh, oh, oh, McLeod's, the Highlander's name.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nYeah, McLeod is Highlander's name.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:28.000\nThanks for backing me up, guys.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:31.000\nAll right, so, yeah, Netflix seems popular.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:34.000\nThat was my, one thing I wrote on my notepad.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:37.000\nWe sang some songs. We talked about race\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:43.000\nand sexual preference again.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:46.000\nWe finally solved it, I think.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nI think we did.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nIt was International Women's Day today?\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nWas that today?\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:54.000\nYeah, and as someone wrote, the only day in the year\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:59.000\nthat has 23 hours in it.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nSeems kind of fucked up.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nI tweeted a bit like that that I thought\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:06.000\ndeserved more response, because I combined\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:09.000\nit with that blackout day that just happened,\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nwhich I don't even know or understand,\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:14.000\nbut I also looked enough to see that I'm not,\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:17.000\nthat me trying to understand it is like not the point.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:22.000\nAnd so I tweeted this morning, Jeff, you'll like this.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:26.000\nInternational Women's Day, right after blackout day?\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:29.000\nWait, no, what are they?\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:35.000\nI grant your blackout day on International Women's Day,\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:39.000\nand I remind you that white men control the length of days.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nI don't remember what I tweeted.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nDan, can I go back a little bit?\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nBecause I wrote a note down while you were doing\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nyour earlier rap of the family song.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\nDid I hear you correctly?\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:52.000\nDid you say spiders and sodomy?\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nNo, but I wish I had.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:55.000\nWhat was it?\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:58.000\nSpiders and sodomy, or spiders to the right of me?\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nOh, spiders to the right of me, yeah.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nI thought for sure you said spiders and sodomy.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\nSpiders to the left of me, leprechauns to the right,\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:07.000\nI think, or something like that.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nGod damn it, I wish that song began in a way\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nthat let me really lean into it.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nI think that you can really start,\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nyou can declare the one for yourself,\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:16.000\nwherever you like it.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:19.000\nDistracts me, this song is like resolving things,\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:22.000\nand then I'm on a different path.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nShould we try a new song?\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nI don't think it was good, though.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:37.000\nWhat about the...\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:41.000\nYeah, so you don't seem very happy about that.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nI'm going to play a couple others just to remind you\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nhow much you like the disco song by Kevin Macleod.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:51.000\nSee if anything, it's like holding the...\n\n27:51.000 --> 28:00.000\nIt's like eating liver.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:06.000\nYeah,

--> 29:54.000\nSo lazy.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nThis better pay off.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:59.000\nI can't rhyme crapper with crapper.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nWhere's that guy going?\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nI'm not working the crowd,\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nI'm just fucking here.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:08.000\nI'm not working the crowd, I'm just fucking here mama\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:11.000\nbecause the bitch is too loud.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nThat's my cure for snoring.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nFuck your mama so hot you can't be ignoring.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:18.000\nI'm a lazy rapper and I'm putting no effort in.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nFuck your mama in a bin.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nAlright.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:25.000\nHe's a lazy, lazy rapper.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nThanks guys, thanks.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nI feel like the only difference between lazy rapper\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nand your normal rapping is that it's just less loud.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nYeah, yeah, no, it's a style choice.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nIt's the same quality of rap.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:41.000\nThey all have different styles, like Fitty said...\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nAnd then Snoop Dogg.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nI need to hear you do some 50 cents for us.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nWell it's gotta be kind of a...\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nOkay, give me some Fitty.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:05.000\nWell, okay, I'll try, but...\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:10.000\nA 50 cent that I'm here to say\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:13.000\nI cost 50 cents all the year every day\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:16.000\nAnd I fucked your mama here and there\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nBut he's faster, I mean, what am I doing?\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:21.000\nBut I'm just saying he has a cadence, he has a style\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nand then Snoop Dogg's like, don't...\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nAnd then he...\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:31.000\nBecause I'm a Snoop Dogg and I went to school\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:34.000\nand I put my mama through and I got a...\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:37.000\nYow, yow, baby bo, baby do, gotta\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:40.000\nput your mama in a boot and a shoe\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:43.000\nI'm a Snoop Dogg, a Snoop Dogg rapper\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\n50 cents is no rapper\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:48.000\nI'm a Snoop Dogg and I'm now Snoop Dogg\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nGhostface killer!\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nI don't know.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nYou have a gift.\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:02.000\nI'm the rich little of 90s rappers\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:06.000\nbut except for 50 cents who probably shoot me for saying that\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:09.000\nWhat is it, his name is 50 cents\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:13.000\nbecause they pulled 50 cents worth of metal out of him\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nwhen he got shot, was that the idea?\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nThat's why he got the name 50 cent.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nDon't ask our crowd.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nI thought that was it.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nI remember looking that up.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:26.000\nHe got shot and survived and they pulled enough metal out of him\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:29.000\nto make 50 cents, something like that.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:32.000\nI don't think I'm getting it right, but it's close to that.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nBlack people don't have it easy\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nand cops are bad.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nAlright, moving on.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nBut there are some cool cops.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nWe've already talked about that.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nObviously there's some cool everything.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nIf all cops were evil, we would have figured it out by now.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nFor instance, if we all of a sudden had the internet\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:55.000\nall of a sudden you'd be seeing all these videos with the murdering people.\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:00.000\nIt would just start happening like that overnight.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nIt has.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:06.000\nBut I think I've met cool cops.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:10.000\nHave you ever met a cop and hang out and just hung out?\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nLike an off-duty cop?\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:16.000\nWhen I was in college, I was a journalism student\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:20.000\nand I did an interview with a cop to tell you about this.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:24.000\nYou had to write something about the police force.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:28.000\nI met a cop back in Whittier that I hated because he was an asshole.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nHe was the chief of police back in Whittier\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:33.000\nand they had this program of harassing the homeless people.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:36.000\nI sat him down, we had lunch, I took him to a Mexican restaurant\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:40.000\nand I'm 18 years old, 19 years old, and we sat down and had lunch.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:43.000\nHe's like, look, I don't like you, you don't like me.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:47.000\nHe gave me the kind of like, you can't handle the truth,\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:51.000\na few good men's speech, you need people like me on that wall.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:54.000\nBy the end of the lunch, I actually liked him.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:57.000\nHe was a human being at the end of that lunch\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nbut I hate the way he operates.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:02.000\nHe was a human being after it\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:06.000\nbut I still think that he was teaching his younger officers\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:10.000\nto come and treat homeless people automatically with disrespect\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nand automatically as less than human.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\nYeah.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:16.000\nIt's like there's two kinds of people in this world,\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:19.000\nthere's the kinds of people that think there's two kinds of people in this world\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nand then there's the good people.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:29.000\nAnd that's sort of what we call right wing and left wing in America.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:35.000\nAnd there's this appealing thing about the idea that there's rules\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:38.000\nand that there is no chaos and that there's never an exception\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:42.000\nbecause that's how you do get shit done as you wake up in the morning\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:45.000\nand decide that you deserve something or that something needs to get done\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:50.000\nand all that stuff and if you did plunge yourself exclusively\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:55.000\ninto what we would call the general left kind of psyche,\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:59.000\nwould you get shit done or would you, I don't know,\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:03.000\nare those the competing parts of our species,\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:09.000\nthis idea that on one hand, everything's crazy.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:12.000\nOh, wow, fuck, you never know anything.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:16.000\nAnd then, I don't know, is it these brush cut guys that we loathe\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nand that make us do these rituals\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nand that they're constantly embarrassing themselves\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:24.000\nand getting us all into trouble and serving as an example to us\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nis like, God, you can't think like that.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:31.000\nIt's a vicious cycle because I got pulled over a couple weeks ago.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:34.000\nI just landed at LAX, was pulling out of this parking lot I always park at,\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nran a stop sign, was right by the police station there\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nand it's like, I just kind of drifted through a stop sign\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:41.000\nand I got pulled over but the guy came to my window.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nI could see him through my side view mirror.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:48.000\nHe was like a very young guy and I really feel like he was probably a very new rookie.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:52.000\nHe came at me like I had just robbed the president's bank\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:55.000\nand kicked his mom in the wallet.\n\n35:55.000 --> 36:00.000\nHe was like handling his gun and freaking out and it freaked me out\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:03.000\nand it's like, I think that's the wrong way to approach anybody.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nWhy does it keep running out of here? Is he alright?\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:06.000\nIs it the same guy?\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:07.000\nYeah, twice he's gone.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nWell, we'll ask him when he gets back, I'm sure he'll enjoy that.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:14.000\nIs he an old-timey reporter? He has to keep going to a phone booth outside?\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:19.000\nStop the presses!\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nHarmon calls Yahoo! Ridiculous!\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:29.000\nSo this cop kept, it's like, you know, I want to get home, he's dropping his pen, he's super nervous.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nAlright, what's going on?\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nSir, what's your name?\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:34.000\nNate.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nAre you okay? Is everything good?\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nYeah, I'm really thirsty.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nBecause you just returned with an A&W...\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\nJesus, sorry.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nEverything's falling to shit.\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:48.000\nYou just returned with a giant two-liter bottle of water?\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:49.000\nYeah.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nDid you go fill it up in the bathroom or what?\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:54.000\nThe water thing, the boss is the sink.\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nThe sink, yeah.\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nCan we talk to you for a second and you just hold the mic?\n\n36:58.000 --> 36:59.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:00.000\nOkay.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:03.000\nI like your shirt. Will you come and sit up here with the camera so I can see your shirt?\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nBecause the guy's got his shirt so it's cooking for Jesus.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nAlright, sit anywhere you like, there you go.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:11.000\nBring a giant water bottle up there too, because you're a very thirsty fellow.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:15.000\nAre you so into hydration that this is a thing or is this like a...\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:19.000\nThat's how much water you're going to drink during our performance tonight?\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nOh no, I just get nervous and stuff.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:22.000\nYou get nervous?\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:23.000\nYeah.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\nAnd when you get nervous, you sprint off.\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:32.000\nBut you ran twice, so the first time was to pee and the second time was to fill up with more pre-pee?\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:33.000\nYeah.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:36.000\nAre you...\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nYou don't feel attacked right now, right?\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:39.000\nNo.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:40.000\nYou don't feel safe?\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:41.000\nOkay, good.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nI'm not making a joke when I say that.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:49.000\nYou're not a freak, we just want to know what you're a journey for us.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:56.000\nNow this diet, A&W root beer bottle, has you drunk that root beer at some point today too?\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:57.000\nOr is this your water bottle?\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:58.000\nNo, it's just my water bottle.\n\n37:58.000 --> 37:59.000\nThat's when you carry around?\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:00.000\nYeah.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:01.000\nAt all times?\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:04.000\nWell, I mean, I get a different one sometimes.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:05.000\nAre you on a...\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:09.000\nIs it a kick that you're on right now, like a diet where you have to drink a lot of water?\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:10.000\nNo, I don't know.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nIs this something you've always done?\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:15.000\nNo, I...\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:18.000\nIt's 80% of the earth, you're the good guy.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nWe should all drink more water.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:27.000\nI got sick, and then I got really paranoid that if I didn't drink water, I'd get a sore throat.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nHow much water do you think you drink a day?\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:34.000\n80 to 100 liters a day?\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nNo, not 100 liters.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:37.000\nWhat are they saying?\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:41.000\n80 to 100 liters of water a day.\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:42.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:43.000\nNate.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:44.000\nNate.\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:46.000\nHow much water are you getting through a day, do you think?\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nMaybe like four of these?\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:51.000\nI feel like you're asking the wrong questions.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nIs it because he's not...\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nYou're being invasive, aren't you?\n\n38:55.000 --> 39:02.000\nYou know that it's weird to drink this much water with this much urgency, and you're not just telling us what we need to know.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:03.000\nAre you diabetic?\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:04.000\nNo, no.\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:06.000\nYou got a cold, and now you have a little...\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:09.000\nSo that's it just to stave off a feeling that you're going to get sick?\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nYeah, it's like a...\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:12.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nYeah.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:18.000\nSomeone just sung placebo.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:23.000\nNo, I mean, that's the greatest addiction to have is to run off and drink water.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:24.000\nGod, I wish.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:27.000\nDoes it sink here that you're just filling up?\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nI wouldn't drink out of the LA tap water.\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:32.000\nOh, yeah, I mean...\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:35.000\nOh.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nSomeone said that's how you got used to it.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nI always wonder about that, too.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:44.000\nSo, okay, so Nate, any advice out there for people out there that want to drink more water?\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:47.000\nI...\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nI'm a bad interviewer.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:55.000\nYou make Arsenio Hall look like Mike Wallace.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nWell, I guess...\n\n39:57.000 --> 40:01.000\nThank you for bravely coming up and giving us more answers.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:06.000\nNate, if at any moment, Nate, you have to get up and run out and go pee, we're not going to make a deal out of it.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nWait, what did you just say, Nate? Did you ask a question?\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.000\nOh, can we just talk about, like, the mother water?\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nOh, something other than water?\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:15.000\nWell, we have another guest here to do that.\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nSo far, all you are is...\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:20.000\nSo far, all you are is the water guy.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nWhat's on your mind, Nate?\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:27.000\nYou can't just drink so much water that we get your opinions about Obama.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nThat's not fair.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nThat's what Donald Trump tries to do.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:34.000\nBuild a bunch of buildings and then I'll have opinions.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nWait, that was 50 cents.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:42.000\nThe emperor has no clothes?\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nHe's so thirsty.\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:48.000\nGod, I really think you go to the doctor and just say,\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:52.000\nDan Harmon said to ask, am I diabetic?\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:55.000\nAre you diagnosing him as diabetic?\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nNo, I'm telling his doctor to.\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:00.000\nAre diabetics notoriously thirsty?\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:02.000\nYes, that's one of the big symptoms.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:06.000\nIf you're not diagnosed yet, that's the first thing that happens.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\nIt's like, fuck, I'm so thirsty.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nAnd then you go in and they're like, yeah, motherfucker.\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:12.000\nGoodbye, ice cream.\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:16.000\nWho else besides me right now is getting thirsty just having this conversation?\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:18.000\nEverybody wants a drink.\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:21.000\nPass your bottle around.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nNate, what's on your mind real quick?\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nIs there anything pressing on your mind?\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nWhat would you talk to us about if you...\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:31.000\nIf you got the conch for a while, what would you lay down on us?\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nOkay, I don't know.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:36.000\nThis is kind of like a question my friend had.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:39.000\nLike, so he said like...\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:42.000\nThis is a good start.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nIt's a good start.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nYour friend said...\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:51.000\nHe said like, he was reading the mythology guy, the...\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:52.000\nJoseph Campbell.\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:53.000\nYes, yes.\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:59.000\nAnd he said like, a lot of religions say that you're guilty, right?\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:02.000\nBut that feels better than a feeling of like,\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:06.000\nyou have no say in what happens in the universe.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:10.000\nSo like, what do you think is tougher as a feeling?\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:14.000\nWell, I mean, I think that...\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nI think that what you named it already,\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:19.000\nwhat's tougher is the idea that you don't have a choice in anything.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nI mean, we can't handle that.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nWe don't perceive the world that way.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nWe make choices in real time.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nWe think of them as choices.\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:31.000\nThat's really the introduction of philosophy that suggests the idea,\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:36.000\nthe technical concept that we technically don't choose anything.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:40.000\nAnd the irony is that probably that's true.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:44.000\nI mean, it almost obviously is because there's what the hell is choice?\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:48.000\nI mean, that debate will drive you crazy because if you...\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nIf all of the circumstances are the same,\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:54.000\nthen that would be like saying that I flip a coin somewhere in my brain,\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:58.000\nlike on some primal level, and that would be something that we didn't want\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:03.000\nbecause we want to think of ourselves as being creatures of some substance\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nand not just a bunch of dice.\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:06.000\nSo we believe in choice.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nWe experience life as choice.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nI think choice is something we made up.\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:17.000\nWe also made up the idea of any kind of organization to everything\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:18.000\nbecause what is it?\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:23.000\nWe're living in a very, very slowed down giant explosion.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nJames had three sips of water during that.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nI'm making him very nervous.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nIs it a nervous response?\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:32.000\nIt's got to be something that has to be related to a nervous response there.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:33.000\nYou're not that thirsty.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:34.000\nIs it possible?\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.000\nI'm really not that thirsty.\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:38.000\nIs that like Lannis' blanket for you?\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:41.000\nYeah, it's like a tick almost.\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:42.000\nI got that.\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nWe all have our own ticks.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nThat's a very healthy one to have, by the way.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:47.000\nYeah.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nMine is PCP.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:54.000\nI strangle a prostitute.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:57.000\nI have to touch the light switch three times before I leave the house\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nand then I'm like...\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nYou're just like the others.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nOkay, now I can edit.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:04.000\nNate, everybody, thank you, Nate.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nThank you, Nate.\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:08.000\nThank you, Nate.\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:09.000\nAlways a...\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:12.000\nHarmontown's thirstiest fan.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:15.000\nI always appreciate it when people come up here\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:18.000\nand they subject themselves to the scrutiny of the spotlight.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:21.000\nWe were just worried because you darted out here like something...\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:26.000\nOh, I was trying to make it like not awkward, you know?\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:30.000\nMission Unaccomplished.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:33.000\nFrom now on, Nate, just walk at any pace you like.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:36.000\nYou can sprint out, you can jog out, you can walk out, you can crawl out.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.000\nWe're not going to make a deal out of it.\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:40.000\nI mean, look at Anatoli next to you.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:41.000\nThis fucking guy...\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:42.000\nDon't move.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nI'm taking a picture of this.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:47.000\nThis is like the height of balls.\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nIs that Garcia Lorca on your shirt?\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:50.000\nWho is that?\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nNo, it's Anton Chekhov.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:53.000\nAnton Chekhov?\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:54.000\nAll right.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nHe had the greatest death of all time.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:57.000\nHow do you die?\n\n44:57.000 --> 45:01.000\nAs far as I know, do you know the circumstances of his death, Anatoli?\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:02.000\nNo.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nAs far as I read that he was quite an old man,\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:05.000\nlike I think it's in his 80 or so,\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:08.000\nand he was on his, like, on his, you know, plantation or whatever,\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nlike his estate, and he and his old wife,\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nhe'd been with forever.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:15.000\nThey had a family over and he would walk out in the garden\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nand he would just improvise stories for his grandchildren.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:18.000\nAnd they would go like,\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:21.000\nGrandpa, the light, the lamp post,\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nand he would just improvise a story for them.\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nSo all the family goes away.\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:26.000\nHe comes back in.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:27.000\nThe family goes home.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nIt's just he and his old wife.\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:30.000\nAnd she says,\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nlet's have champagne and some strawberries or something.\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:33.000\nAnd he goes,\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nI haven't had champagne in a very long time.\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:36.000\nI think I'll rest.\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\nAnd so she goes off to get the champagne.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:39.000\nWhen she comes back,\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nhe's laying on the couch dead with a smile on his face.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:42.000\nAnd she sits down next to him\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nand drinks the champagne and has the strawberries\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nand just like, she's like, fuck it.\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:47.000\nThat's a great death.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:48.000\nAnd then in his funeral,\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:51.000\nI guess all these Russians turned out to go to his funeral.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nAnd I might have this wrong.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:54.000\nSomebody please fact check this.\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nI think it's Chekhov's death,\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nwhere they all go,\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nCoffin's on a train car\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nand they all march behind the train car\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:03.000\nin the cold rain or whatever.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nAnd it's a bunch of fancy pants society people\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:08.000\nthat all want to go more in Chekhov's death.\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nThey realize also it smells like crap\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:11.000\nbecause they're following the wrong train\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:12.000\nand it's got oysters on it.\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nAnd it says it's rotting fish.\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nAnd they'd followed for miles the wrong train\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nand they had to go all the way back\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nthe other direction to follow the right train back.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\nAnd his friends of Chekhov said,\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:23.000\nit's like he wrote his own funeral\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nbecause that's exactly what he would have written.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:28.000\nBut falling asleep while your wife is off to get champagne\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nand her coming back and you have a smile on your face\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nand she finishes the champagne is groovy.\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:33.000\nI like that.\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nYou know, you hold your breath though\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:36.000\nbecause you go like, well, okay,\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nso I would come back and I would be like,\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:43.000\nah, no, no.\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nAnd in between like shaking the corpse,\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nI'd be like, why couldn't you have done it\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nafter calling me a cunt?\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:50.000\nWhy is that better?\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:53.000\nBecause what the fuck I was looking forward to\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nhaving champagne like the one afternoon.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:56.000\nThey were in their 80s.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:57.000\nThey're old people.\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:58.000\nIt's going to happen.\n\n46:58.000 --> 46:59.000\nStensibly they've done it before.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nNo, I know I'm the bad guy,\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\nbut I'm saying like that's why I'm afraid.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:04.000\nThat's what that's fear of death\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nis the thing that makes you go, no.\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nLike, I want the good things.\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nIf you're in your 80s and let's say\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nyou're 90 and Erin would be what, 80?\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:13.000\nHow about you?\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:14.000\nShe should be like 23.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:15.000\nShe's 23, right.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nEvery guy, she's a fetus right now.\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:20.000\nAnd you're in your like old people\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:23.000\nand if you peacefully passed away at 90 years old\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nand she came in with a bottle of Kettle One\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nand sat down next to you\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nand you had a smile on your face,\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nit's a pleasant way to go.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:32.000\nI'm going to cry thinking about that.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:33.000\nThat's so fucked up.\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nYou're 90 years old in the story.\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nBut it's just, that would have been\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:40.000\nthe first afternoon that I stopped working\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:43.000\nand I would be like, oh, let's have some Kettle One.\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nLike, maybe once it gets boring,\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:48.000\nlike a good death would be like,\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:51.000\nokay, let's go to Costco.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:54.000\nAnd she's like, I'll go get the card\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nand then she comes back and I'm dead.\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nAnd she'd be like, she'd look at my corpse\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nand look at the card and be like,\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nI can go to Albertsons\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nbecause no bulk.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:13.000\nAnd it's like, yeah, he nailed his death.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:14.000\nWe don't have to go to Costco.\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:15.000\nGreg Proops his joke.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nThere was a big fear when they found out\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nthat Jimi Hendrix had lied about being gay\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nto get out of the Vietnam War and Greg said,\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:22.000\nI lied about being gay last Wednesday\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:25.000\nto get out of going to Home Depot.\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:28.000\nAll right, wait, can we, he graciously like,\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:31.000\nI told him to come because there's never been\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:34.000\na more overwhelming demand for somebody to come back,\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:37.000\nspecifically for his performance in Shadow Run.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:38.000\nCurtis Armstrong came back.\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\nOh, shit!\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:47.000\nHow special.\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:53.000\nThank you.\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:55.000\nThank you.\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:57.000\nThank you.\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:58.000\nHi!\n\n48:58.000 --> 48:59.000\nThank you.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:02.000\nThank you.\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:05.000\nGosh, I've never been asked back anywhere.\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nUsually they're so relieved.\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nAfter the show last time, we were like,\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nyou'd split and we were back in the green room\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:15.000\nand Dan's like, I really want him to come back.\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:16.000\nI'm like, ask him.\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:17.000\nI don't know.\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:18.000\nThat seems like forward.\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nI'm like, it's better to ask and him say no.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:21.000\nLike, let's just ask.\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:22.000\nWell, like I'm gonna say no.\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:23.000\nBut I mean, you said last week,\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:25.000\nyou said, you know, you have to come back.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:27.000\nEverybody always says you have to come back\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:28.000\nand then you never hear from them again.\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:29.000\nOh, is that what's going on\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:30.000\non the other side of those conversations?\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:31.000\nYeah, because I always go,\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:33.000\nyou have to come back and then they go, yeah.\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:34.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:35.000\nWhat was happening in this case was,\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nyou said to me, we have to have you back.\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:39.000\nAnd I said, great, that would be great.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:40.000\nAnd then I walked out thinking,\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:41.000\nwell, he'll never come back.\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:42.000\nOh, this is great.\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nWow, what a great new family member.\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nI actually get asked back.\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nNo one ever does that.\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:59.000\nNow you have to come back every week for sure.\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:02.000\nWhich you'll do until the season of King of the Nerds.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:03.000\nIt gets picked up.\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:04.000\nAnd then I don't have to.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:05.000\nYeah.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nAnd then you'll be like, fuck you nerds.\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:09.000\nFly away in your biplane.\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nThat's how I picture rich people.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:12.000\nYeah.\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:14.000\nYou're just flying in a biplane.\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:15.000\nYeah.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:16.000\nSeeing that.\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:19.000\nLet's also just, let's bring out a title wave of friends.\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nLet's bring out Spencer.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:22.000\nSpencer.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nSpencer Crittenden.\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:28.000\nSpencer, get your cheeks out here.\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:30.000\nHe may have.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:31.000\nOkay.\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:33.000\nSpencer's getting high in the back or something.\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:34.000\nHe was back there somewhere.\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nHe probably, but when we brought you up,\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nhe's probably, I probably have about 10 minutes\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\nto do what needs to be done.\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nAnd he grabbed his rubber hose and his needle.\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nIf I know Spencer, what time is it?\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:46.000\n9.03.\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nIf I know Spencer, he's giving cut rate hands jobs\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:49.000\nout in the parking lot.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nI do it because I like to do it.\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:57.000\nThat's the thing about hands jobs.\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nI like giving them.\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:04.000\nBut you never, you never, no one ever tells you.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:05.000\nYeah.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.000\nWell, you should, you should, you should just give them.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:08.000\nThat's Spencer impression.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:09.000\nLike ran out some rocks.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:10.000\nWow.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nYou're really a bad impressionist.\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nI don't know. I mean, it's just learning new things\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nabout your, about your coworkers.\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:18.000\nDo you have, do you have any impression?\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:19.000\nI will not make you do them, but do you,\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:21.000\ndo you, are you a person that has impressions in you\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:22.000\nor do you not have any?\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:23.000\nOh, no, no, no, I don't really,\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:24.000\nI don't really have impressions.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:25.000\nI'm not very good at it.\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:26.000\nI, as a child.\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:27.000\nDo you hear Dan?\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:28.000\nHey!\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:29.000\nThere he is.\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:37.000\nWe're out in the parking lot.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nHe's giving HJs.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:44.000\nLooks like you're, are you bringing those to flaunt?\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:46.000\nYou've got water in every pocket.\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:47.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:52.000\nTwo, you know, there's more than one guy\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nthat drinks an abnormal amount of water, Dan.\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:55.000\nYeah.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:58.000\nNo, I just, I'm sorry I came on and I cut you off.\n\n51:58.000 --> 51:59.000\nThat was very rude of me.\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:00.000\nIt's all right.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nI actually had started a water backstage,\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:05.000\nbut I left it there because I was self-conscious after.\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:08.000\nJesus, I don't want to be the anti-water guy.\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:12.000\nI figured, I, you know, you'd, you know, start in on me.\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nI still, I still think...\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:15.000\nCurtis.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:16.000\nCurtis.\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nI still think that guy is being dodgy.\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:19.000\nHe's cool, man.\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:20.000\nI'm cool.\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:21.000\nHe got up twice.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:22.000\nThis is what I don't understand.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nHow thirsty can you be?\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:27.000\nWithin 45 seconds of my memory, I was very close together.\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nSo one time was to pee and one time was to get water,\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:32.000\nbut he's, water is part of his life.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:35.000\nI don't know, I think the guy is like shady and dishonest\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:38.000\nand a terrible person.\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nI don't think so.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:43.000\nHe's cooking for Jesus.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:46.000\nObviously, I'm kidding.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:51.000\nI just, you know, we're concerned about our fans when they go running like that.\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:54.000\nSo, so, all right, so where did we leave off?\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:55.000\nMoonlighting.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nMy wife is not coming this week.\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.000\nShe's not coming this week.\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:07.000\nSo she doesn't get to ask me those really awkward questions\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nthat I had to follow up each time\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nbecause I wasn't sure what she meant.\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:12.000\nYeah.\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:16.000\nShe, she is sick.\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nI don't know how much more I'm supposed to say.\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:19.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:20.000\nShe's pooping a lot.\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:21.000\nShe's puking.\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nSounds like diabetes.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:26.000\nShe thought it was food poisoning.\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nBy the way, my lovely wife,\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:31.000\nI just listened to their first episode of their new podcast\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:34.000\nthat she's doing with Wayne Fetterman called Human Conversation.\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:37.000\nIt's a, it's 55 minutes of your life.\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nIt's not that big a deal.\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nGive it a listen.\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:42.000\nIt's like a...\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:45.000\nRage Dan Harmon from the Chicago Tribune.\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nIt's a, it's a pleasant chat.\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nI mean, I honestly, I've only listened to one episode.\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:50.000\nThere's something kind of addictive about it.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:53.000\nIt's like, it sort of harkens back to a kind of like,\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nI don't know, morning or afternoon.\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nLike kind of, it's just a man and a woman.\n\n53:57.000 --> 54:00.000\nThey're just chatting and it's kind of, it's, it's, it's funny to me.\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nBut then again, I'm a big fan of my wife.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:03.000\nI don't know.\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:06.000\nBut this Wayne Fetterman fellow seems very, very funny too.\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\nHe's kind of, he's kind of like...\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:10.000\nHe's coaching her basketball team, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:11.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nAnd he sort of, he sort of has a kind of like,\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:16.000\nold man sensibility that kind of like,\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:20.000\nI don't know, like liberates you to look at the world\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nrandomly or afresh.\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nLike he doesn't use profanity.\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nHe, I don't know, it's funny.\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:29.000\nWhen I think about how

54:39.000\nI know. Where do you start, right?\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:42.000\nI mean, I feel like, you know, you were sort of on a roll\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:43.000\nand then I came out.\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:44.000\nNo, no, no, I wasn't.\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nCurtis, Curtis, you're sitting only three feet away\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nfrom one of the greatest, most gifted interviewers of all time.\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:49.000\nI know.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:50.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:51.000\nI know. I've been here before.\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:54.000\nBe prepared to answer some very trenchant,\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\nvery salient questions.\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:58.000\nOkay, fire away, man.\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:03.000\nWhen did you lose your virginity?\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:08.000\nAnd how and why?\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:10.000\nIn any order.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:11.000\nOkay.\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:24.000\nI lost my virginity at the age of 21 or two.\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:27.000\nChill?\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nShe's here?\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:33.000\nUnbelievable.\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:34.000\nWas it Jill?\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:38.000\nIt's Jill. She's here.\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:42.000\nI lost my virginity at the age of 21 or 22\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:44.000\nin Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nWhoa, sounds like you're making that up.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:47.000\nI'm not.\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nSo you had a gal in Kalamazoo.\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:52.000\nZoo, zoo, zoo, zoo.\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:56.000\nAnd she took pity on me where none had before.\n\n55:56.000 --> 56:03.000\nAnd she deprived me of my virginity.\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nBut only once.\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:10.000\nIs this still the same Curtis that was playing a tableau violin?\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:14.000\nNo, this is a slightly later Curtis, just by a couple of years.\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:17.000\nWhat was your bag at age 21, 22?\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:23.000\nI did English accents because I thought it might make me more attractive.\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:27.000\nSo I would learn to do English accents.\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:33.000\nAnd in fact, I remember Jill telling me that the reason she actually slept with me\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:36.000\nwas because of my English accent.\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:38.000\nSo it worked.\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:41.000\nHow did she encounter it?\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nWell, because I would do it.\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:47.000\nBut I mean like, well, so you were working the front window and you're like,\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nwould you like whole fries with that governor?\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:50.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:53.000\nIt was a more, it wasn't like a governor one.\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:54.000\nIt was more of a...\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\nCould you do it by region?\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:58.000\nYou say accents, like could you do region?\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:01.000\nYeah, I would do, well, I mean, I would do my idea of regions.\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:05.000\nBut it would really would be like a bad cockney.\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:08.000\nAnd then there would be, it would be Nigel Bruce.\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:12.000\nIt would be a cockney or, you know, extraordinary homes.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:14.000\nThat sort of thing.\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:16.000\nThat's a very good Nigel Bruce, by the way.\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:18.000\nYou can do impressions. That's very good.\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:20.000\nThat was one, yeah. I did do that one.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:22.000\nI used to do them when I was a child.\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:24.000\nI think Nigel Bruce is too blustery as a...\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:27.000\nI agree with you. He is as Watson, yes.\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nHe's too blustery, but I loved him.\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:30.000\nYeah, he's great.\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\nHe's not Watson, but I loved him.\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:34.000\nAnd I found I could do him.\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:37.000\nNow, doing Nigel Bruce doesn't get you laid.\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.000\nYou would have to do it.\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:41.000\nUnless you're doing Nigel Bruce.\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:44.000\nUnless you're...\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:47.000\nWho only has sex with straight men?\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:49.000\nIt's a callback.\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nMy favorite part of that fad of a joke\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nwas watching the lights in the camera\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\ntrying to find where the comedy was.\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:06.000\nThe director was like,\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:10.000\nsomething funny has to be going on right now.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:12.000\nHold it.\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:14.000\nDo I take it that this young lady\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:16.000\nand you were part of the same theatrical community?\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:19.000\nYes, we were, in school, you know, in college.\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:24.000\nAnd I had done a part in a play that somebody had written,\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:26.000\nand I did it with an English accent,\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\nnot because it was required,\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:31.000\nbecause I thought it would be a good chance\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:34.000\nto show off my English accent, and it worked.\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nAll right, well, we're getting to know you,\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\nand I'm trying to play it cool, but it's 9-11.\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:41.000\nAnd we're trying to establish a tradition here at 9-11.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:42.000\nWhat was it about?\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:43.000\nOh, my God!\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nWhat do we do? We make a...\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:48.000\nOh, it was the 9-11 thing from last week.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:49.000\nDid we just sing the 9-11 song?\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:50.000\nHit it!\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nNo, that's probably going to be offensive.\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nThat's going to end up offensive.\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nOh, not if it's sultry, though.\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:14.000\nWhy'd you have to bring those towers down?\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:21.000\nWhy'd you have to bring my country up frown?\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:24.000\nWe're just trying to be free.\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:27.000\nWhy you gotta attack me?\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:32.000\nLet your terrorist body down to the brink of dawn.\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:35.000\nYo, Elkada, why you gotta be like that?\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:36.000\nAin't no fighting.\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nAin't it gotta be a spat?\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:41.000\nYo, Elkada, in Afghanistan,\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:44.000\nain't trying to do it in Iraq and Iran.\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:45.000\nYou gotta...\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:47.000\nI'm just trying to be cool in New York.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:52.000\nI gotta look up to the sky and see fallin' pork.\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:56.000\nWhat I thought, but I found out it was...\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:57.000\nIt's fucked up.\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:59.000\nI'm gonna cry.\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nI'm traumatized.\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nI saw a guy who told me it was P to the TSD.\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nI thought, shouldn't get that in the city, you see?\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nI'm just a deli worker and a rapper on the side\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000\ntrying to lay it low and open up wide\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nand live my life and pay my revenues.\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nFuck you, Elkada.\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nWhy you choose to attack us?\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nCause you're gonna pay no freedom.\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nWhy you hate away your life?\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nYou gotta attack or no?\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nTwo towers and two states of mind.\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nWhen you look beyond it, you'll find that\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000\neverybody just wants to get down,\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000\ngot a tower on the left and now it's down.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nWhy the fuck you do that?\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nNow, everybody's changed and language is changing\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nlike a...\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nOh, shit, I can't rap anymore.\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nI'm all broken up because of 9-Eleven.\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nOkay.\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nJesus.\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nWow.\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nThe final casualty of 9-Eleven is your ability to rap.\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000\nI blamed it on 9-Eleven.\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nDo you want to drink, Curtis?\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nI might have one in a minute.\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nI'm okay right now, I'll take that.\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nOtherwise I'm digging in your ice.\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nThat's all right.\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nHere, reminder that I've been digging the ice all night.\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nOkay.\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nSo Jill, where did it all go?\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nJill?\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nWhere did it go down with Jill?\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nWhere did it go down with Jill?\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nWhere did it happen?\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nIn my room.\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nYou have an apartment, a dorm?\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nA dorm, yeah.\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nIt was just once.\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nNever again, one time?\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nNo, that was it.\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nI mean, since then, yes.\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nBut with Jill, it was just the one time.\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nEnjoyable?\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000\nWas it a good time?\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nIt was very quick.\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nIt was very quick, but yeah.\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nI mean, she only needed the one.\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nYes, it worked perfectly.\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nYeah, once it's done, and it's done,\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nand you move on with your life.\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nAnd she did, and I never found anyone\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nwho was as attracted to the English accent after that.\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nThat was like a one time thing that worked.\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nDid you try the English accent?\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nYeah, I still do.\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nReally?\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nYeah.\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000\nOnce I was at a bar, I had a roommate who was Irish,\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nand we were at a bar pretending to do Scottish accents,\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nand there was nobody at this bar.\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nHe was Irish, but he was pretending to do Scottish accents?\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nHe was from Dublin, and we were hanging out at the three of clubs,\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nand there was nobody in the bar but us in the bartenders,\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nand they were far down the other side of the room.\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nAnd so, for some reason, he was talking about a friend of his,\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nand he was doing a Scottish accent to tell the story,\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nand so I started doing it too.\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nAnd then these girls came up next to us in order to drink,\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nand they're like, oh, where are you guys from?\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nAnd he's like, oh, it's from Aberdeen,\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nand he could really do it, and I could kind of do it,\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nand so he was nailing it, and they're like,\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\noh, my God, this accent is so great.\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000\nAnd then all their friends showed up, and there were more girls.\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nNow, the bartenders had known, they knew me,\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nand they knew that we weren't Scottish earlier in that evening.\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nNow we're doing it because now we just don't want it.\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nNow it's just embarrassing to stop doing it,\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nand we thought any moment these girls would get their drinks,\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000\ngo leave, sit down somewhere and leave us,\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nthat'll be that, and just more people came around,\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nand it's like, are you from...\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000\nI've been to Aberdeen, and he...\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nOh, now you're in trouble.\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000\nBut he's like, how far is Aberdeen from Leith?\n\n01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nOh, it's about 45 minutes to go up there,\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nand he knew all the fucking shit,\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nand so there was one girl there, her name was Mouse,\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nand I had never met this girl in my life.\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nIs she a DJ?\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nShe actually was a DJ.\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nAll right, well...\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nWell spotted.\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nBut I had not met this girl in my life,\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000\nand so...\n\n01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nWas either that or her parents raised her in a basement.\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nProbably both.\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nSo I kept seeing her every two weeks for the rest of time,\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nfor the rest of eternity, I kept running into her,\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nand we had talked for a good 45 minutes\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nin this me doing this bullshit Scottish accent.\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nSo every time I'd see her,\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nshe'd walk into another bar on a different side of town,\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nand I would turn to whoever was next to her,\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000\nand go, okay, I'm Scottish.\n\n01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000\nShe's like, oh, everybody!\n\n01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nMelinda, Carissa, this is Jeff,\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000\nhe's from Aberdeen from Scotland,\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nand he's got the best accent.\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nHow'd you do? Good to see you again.\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nAnd I would do that, and I was so tiring.\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nSo one day, after about a year and a half of this...\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nLook, I honestly saw her a dozen times,\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nand I kept doing it, and I felt so bad about it,\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nand I didn't want to...\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000\nI wasn't getting anything out of this.\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nShe just kept... She loved that I had...\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nI was from Scotland, and I was not.\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nSo I had enough of it, and so I went up to her,\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nand she goes, hey, Jeff, how you doing?\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nThis is my friend Melinda, and so on and so forth.\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nI'm like, hey, what's going on?\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nAnd she couldn't...\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nGives me a weird look, and I said,\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nhow you doing? I'm doing great, how you doing?\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nAnd she's like, where's your accent?\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nYou know, I'm an actor, and they tell you,\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nlike as an actor, you just practice speaking\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nin an American accent as often as possible.\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nJust to get good at it.\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000\nAnd she goes, and she's still looking at me like...\n\n01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nShe goes, okay, do it. Do your American accent.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nI'm like, what do you want me to say?\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nAnd she goes, I'd like a cheeseburger and fries.\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nI go, I'd like a cheeseburger and fries.\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nAnd she goes, it's okay.\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nIt's okay.\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nI was so...\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nLike right up to the five inches before the finish line,\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nthat story was going to be called,\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nYou're an asshole.\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nOh no, that's certainly the title of that story.\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nBecause on any given day,\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nlike in any bar in LA, there's some fuckface\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nwho's like lying to people for social profit.\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nIt never got me laid, it never earned me a penny.\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nI profited none off of doing that.\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nIt was just, I felt it was weirder to just say,\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\noh, I was bullshitting you the whole time.\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nI thought I'd never see you again.\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nAnd then it turns out we went to the same free places all the time.\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nIt was such a weird culture shock.\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nLike I could barely remember being back in Wisconsin\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nwhere this never happened.\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nI remember moving from Wisconsin to LA.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nI remember going out and trying to just hang out\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nbecause that's what I did in Milwaukee.\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nLike you just went out and just drank and made friends.\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nAnd I remember small talking, some guy at some bar\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nbecause my friends dragged me too.\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nAnd I was like, so what do you do?\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nAnd he's like, I silk screened t-shirts.\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nAnd I was like, oh, that's interesting.\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nI don't know anything about silk screening t-shirts.\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nHow does that work?\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nAnd he's like, well, you take a thing and you do this\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nand he's describing the whole process.\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000\nAnd I go, so then do you mass produce them\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nand do you sell them through like a PO box or whatever?\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nAnd he goes, I'm just fucking with you, man.\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nAnd I'm like, that's hilarious.\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nI'm going to go home and write a hit TV show.\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nHit in quotes, hit in quotes.\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nNo, I just, it was like, it was a really big,\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nlike I prefer LA culture to Milwaukee culture.\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nI think there's a heavy share of dishonesty\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nin institutionalized alcoholism as well.\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nWe weren't good people just because,\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nbut we didn't have a reason to fuck with people.\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nThat wasn't recreation.\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nIt was for assholes.\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nYou called those people assholes.\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nIf you caught somebody saying something\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000\nto someone that wasn't true,\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nthat person was just an asshole.\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nAnd in LA, it's like,\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nbut do you see the coolest guy in the world?\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nThere's just more people\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nand we all came from all these different cities.\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nDid I tell you the story about the guy that lied to me\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nand I caught him in a lie at the drawing room?\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nI don't know his name, so it's not inflammatory.\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nI sat next to a guy and he was daytime drinking\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000\nat the drawing room, our little dive bar,\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nand it's like a little cheers-y kind of place\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nwhere everyone knows everybody.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nMinus the cheers.\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nMinus the cheers.\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nMore sadness and more drug addicts.\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nLess of a clarinet and more of like a 60-cycle hum\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nthat you hear when you leave the inch jack\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nlike laying in some water.\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nAnd a slight smell of methane and poop in the air.\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nIt's a great place.\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000\nSo this guy was sitting at the end of the bar\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nand something came up and so we're talking across the bar\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nabout the song that's in the jig box or whatever.\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nSo we're having a conversation.\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nSo I just scoot down so we're not yelling.\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nSo I sit near him and we're having a conversation.\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nWhat do you do?\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nHe's like, I'm a writer.\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nI'm a filmmaker.\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nI live up in the Los Feliz Hills here\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nand I got a great house, married.\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nIt's just like life is fantastic.\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nI'm doing what I want.\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nI'm making these movies.\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nNo one watches them.\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nThey're kind of for nothing.\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nAnd I'm usually broke.\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nI'm mortgaging the house all the time.\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nBut I'm doing what I love.\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nI'm like, that's fantastic.\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nAnd he never once asked me what I did,\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nwhich is a very common thing,\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nhaving a conversation with people in Los Angeles\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nor strangers.\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nHe just kind of went in his monologue\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nabout how awesome things were.\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nAnd so I just kept asking him questions.\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nLike, where'd you grow up?\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nI grew up here in LA.\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nWhat did you do before filmmaking?\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nI'm kind of a failed actor.\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nI was an actor.\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nI did theater as a kid.\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nOh, me too.\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nI did theater as a kid.\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nAnd he goes, yeah, I was on Broadway as a kid.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nSo was I.\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nAnd I said, what show did you do on Broadway?\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nAnd he goes, OK, now he's blind because you don't remember.\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nYou forget the show you were on in Broadway.\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nIt was the thing with the guy.\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nYou remember the fucking show that you did on Broadway.\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000\nSo he's fishing for it.\n\n01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000\nAnd he goes, it's the one with the chits on the feathers.\n\n01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.000\nNow, what he doesn't know is he's now walking towards saying\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nthat he was on.\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nAnd also, I found out he's my age.\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nHe's a year older than I am.\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nHe says that he's in.\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000\nHe goes, it's the one with the bald guy, your Brenner.\n\n01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nThat guy with the King and I.\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000\nNo.\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nNow, Curtis, I was on Broadway in 1985 in the King and I.\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000\nSo he's I go.\n\n01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nAnd at that point I go, oh, how old are you?\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nBecause it might have been a different production of it.\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000\nHe goes, I'm 41 or whatever he was.\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nI was a couple of years older than me at the time.\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000\nI'm like, OK.\n\n01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nSo how old were you?\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000\nHave been at the time?\n\n01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000\nHe's like, so I guess that would have been.\n\n01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nI would have been about 11, 12 years old.\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nAnd no.\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nSo then your Brenner was dead at that point.\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nBecause I was the last guy to play.\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nI said, what role did you play?\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nAnd he goes, I played the kid.\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000\nI go, Louie?\n\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nYeah, I played Louie.\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nBecause there's only one white kid and the King and I.\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000\nThe other kids are all the Siamese kids of the King.\n\n01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nRight.\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nAnd the Prince.\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nAnd so I'm like, that's such a crazy thing to say.\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nAlso, I thought he was lying when he didn't know the name of it.\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nSo I'm sitting there.\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000\nAnd we talked for, I would say, a solid 45 minutes an hour\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nabout his life and about everything.\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nAnd I learned all this stuff.\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nAnd now I'm just kind of reeling.\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nEverything he said has been bullshit.\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000\nSo I said, so that would have been in 1985?\n\n01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nDid you, are you sure it wasn't like a few years before?\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nBecause, and maybe furious, like, and he goes, he goes,\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nno, no, no, I did it with your Brenner.\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nI played Louie in the King and I in 1985.\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nAnd I was like, I said, so did I.\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000\nAnd he, his hair fucking went white.\n\n01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000\nAnd he goes, oh, I said, I was trying to take him off the hook.\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nI said, look, when I was doing it, and also, by the way,\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nI never missed a performance.\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nSo like, there's not even a chance that he was an understudy.\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nI wondered, maybe he was one of my understudies,\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nbecause there were seven of them.\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000\nI was like, oh, fuck, maybe he was one of those kids\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nthat I don't remember from back then.\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nAnd I said, well, I did it too.\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nAnd I said, maybe did you just audition for it?\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nBecause you were constantly auditioning for it.\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nAnd he just picked up his shit and walked out.\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nOh!\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nThat's one of the, and I turned to the bar and said,\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nwhat the fuck was that?\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000\nI said, he told the only lie I could catch him in.\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nHe named, if he said he played the black kid in the whiz,\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nI couldn't have busted him on that.\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nAnd if he said he was rum-tum-tugger,\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nI couldn't have fucking got him.\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nBut he said the role and the day and the thing,\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nhe couldn't name the theater.\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000\nHe was just full of shit.\n\n01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000\nAnd a lot of those people congregate in bars and do that.\n\n01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nSo I turned to the bar and said, did you fucking hit him?\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nAnd she goes, oh yeah, by the way, his wife hates his guts.\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nHe doesn't live at home.\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nEverything he said was absolute malarkey.\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nAnd so, pursuantly, since I've seen him,\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nI once in a while, he's come back in,\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nand he'll see me, and he'll walk him right back out.\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nWhere are we talking about that?\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000\nThere's an actual...\n\n01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000\nNate, everybody!\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nThey want to get hydrated.\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nLet's use the...\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000\nI wasn't going to say anything.\n\n01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000\nLet's use the transition to bring Jamorge out here.\n\n01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nJamorge Brown, everybody!\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nCurtis hasn't met Jamorge.\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nRight, okay.\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000\nOh!\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nYeah, music choice seems racist.\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000\nIt was your 9-11 song, wasn't it?\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nCan we edit together all the missed handshakes\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nand high fives that I did over here?\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nDid I miss one?\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nNo, no, every time people come up,\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nI get one of these and they just go right on by.\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nBut we were just...\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nThat happened last week.\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nIt did.\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nIt happens, Curtis.\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nPeople just...\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000\nWe did this earlier.\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nYou hugged me.\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nI didn't just do this.\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nI hugged you.\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nI hugged you.\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nI hugged you after giving you a break.\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000\nI hugged you after giving you a break.\n\n01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nI hugged you after giving you a break.\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000\nWhen everyone else walks by,\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nyou're not even there.\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nYou know why?\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nWhy?\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000\nBecause you're a tender soul.\n\n01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nYeah, well...\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000\nJamorge lies with his eyes.\n\n01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nAnd his body.\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nAnd his body.\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nDear Jimmy.\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000\nI love the idea of Jamorge as a bad person.\n\n01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nThat is a funny idea.\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:54.080\nLike a little fucking evil\n\n01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.080\nman.\n\n01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.080\nHe seems impenetrable.\n\n01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.720\nnot stop at just images of DeMorge doing something really fucked up and cruel to\n\n01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:04.640\nsomebody. It just seems ironic. I saw DeMorge at the grocery store and he was just like,\n\n01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:16.280\nkick to this kid. I did it. But with that liar guy, like there's just a like, God damn it,\n\n01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:19.520\nI swear I was just talking about this with somebody probably on this podcast, but there\n\n01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:26.840\nwas also like, this is a thing with alcoholism too. There's a sort of disorder where you\n\n01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:31.160\nstart to become a pathological liar and we band you that phrase around pathological liar\n\n01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:38.720\nand we tend to mean somebody who lies a lot. But it's like, there are people who truly\n\n01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:44.360\ncannot control. And not just can't tell the truth, won't tell the truth. They won't and\n\n01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:49.320\nthey can't and they lie and they lie and they lie. And I think there's some there's some\n\n01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:54.520\nlink with alcohol there where like, if your brain starts to fucking like, if you're like\n\n01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.520\ncommitted to sitting there drinking, that's why you find like, at those troughs, they're\n\n01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:04.720\nlike, there's just these guys with a million stories and they, they kind of it starts to,\n\n01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.120\nthere's some, there's some syndrome where you start to create your own memories and\n\n01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:12.080\nyou stack them up and then like you're drawing on those and you don't know it's not the truth,\n\n01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.840\nexcept that guy, I would be willing to bet in that moment when you said the reason his\n\n01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:20.640\nhair turned white is because he realized in that moment he was lying, not so much because\n\n01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.440\nhe got caught because he realized because he was like, yeah, oh shit, there's no way\n\n01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.440\nI'm telling the truth right now.\n\n01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.560\nI see, I can't, I don't know. I think that he knew he was bullshitting me from front\n\n01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:34.520\nto back. He wasn't drunk. He didn't, he didn't strike me as a career drinker.\n\n01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.840\nWe always think about lies as being like this thing that you use like a crowbar because\n\n01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.680\nwe, we, we have a conscience and we, we tend not to lie to each other because we feel guilt\n\n01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:47.920\nabout it. And so when we look at like sociopathic tendencies as being like, like, oh, that person's\n\n01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.180\ncheating and they're using like a thing, a tool to open a thing and they can get more\n\n01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.600\nshit done than we can.\n\n01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:59.920\nBut there's a dark side to it where they can't control it. They cannot. They can't just be\n\n01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:04.960\nnormal. They can't feel and they, they can't be, they can't be beholden to this wonderful\n\n01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.920\nthing we all share, which is this river we'd go down, which is like, there's fucking truth.\n\n01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.920\nGet on it, motherfucker.\n\n01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:15.600\nWell, you know, there's, there's something else which occurred to me was he may have\n\n01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:21.320\nbeen lying to you. He may also have been lying to the, to the bartender because if she was\n\n01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:26.440\nreally good looking, he would of course tell her that his wife doesn't love him and he\n\n01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.440\ndoesn't live at home.\n\n01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.440\nYeah, that I don't know.\n\n01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.440\nThat whole thing.\n\n01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.520\nI think she, I think she, she had said that like, it wasn't that he had unburdened that\n\n01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.840\non her is that he, she happens to either know the woman or she knows somebody else that\n\n01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.800\nknows the score there. So like, like it was like kind of, I think semi verifiable that\n\n01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:43.800\nthat wasn't the case.\n\n01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:44.800\nYeah.\n\n01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.880\nBut that's, that's very likely. I think that he was just, I think he was creating a fantasy\n\n01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.160\nworld that, and in that world, everything not only is great, but also has always been\n\n01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.640\ngreat and always has been different.\n\n01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.640\nOh yeah.\n\n01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:01.320\nAnd that has to be easy to do in that world because if you're a person who's planted at\n\n01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.280\na bar on a regular basis, to the left and to the right of you, you have people who kind\n\n01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.600\nof flit in and flit out.\n\n01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.600\nYeah.\n\n01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.600\nAnd they're all looking through.\n\n01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.040\nAnd you can tell pieces of that story. You can lay the game with all, you know, with\n\n01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.040\nall those, with all those just people.\n\n01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.040\nThat's why you go to a bar. That's why you don't just sit at home and drink. Like you,\n\n01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:19.680\nyou go to a bar, the idea is this chorus line of linear connectivity that you can choose.\n\n01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:24.080\nYou can stare forward and drink or you can bother to connect with one person and control\n\n01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.640\nit. And if that person says, I'm a trumpet player, and he's like, you start to feel like\n\n01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.760\nyou're getting your life done. Like you're a cooler person than sober people. Like, there's\n\n01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.960\na camera behind the bar pointing at me. I'm getting to know the trumpet player. I'm expanding\n\n01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.200\nmy horizons.\n\n01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:41.040\nBut then there's, of course, like any biosphere, there's this fungus growing on that, which\n\n01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:45.640\nis like people who are just like, yeah, I'm a trumpet player. They're not. They're just\n\n01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:53.360\nmore alcohol than man. Weird. What if I became one of them? What if I was just like, what\n\n01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.640\nif I lost my whole life to that? What if I was just sitting there going like, all right,\n\n01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:03.440\nNBC, and then I'm a spider? You're a spider? Yeah, I'm a spider. I work for NBC and I'm\n\n01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.440\na spider.\n\n01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:08.960\nTell me more. I gotta eat legs. And then the next time there's this person, you talk to\n\n01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.960\nyou like you got the whole spiel about the eight legs going on. And do you think it's\n\n01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.400\nthe truth?\n\n01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:21.280\nLet's not do that. Let's just drink it home like we should. Okay. We should start playing\n\n01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:30.000\nShadowrun and we got no Aaron, so we should. Oh, yeah? Somebody has nominated himself to\n\n01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nplay Mercy.\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.880\nSounds like Adam Goldberg. Think about that. But don't you get him? What's your name?\n\n01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:36.880\nJen?\n\n01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:42.400\nJen? I'll leave it to the audience. Adam Goldberg or just Jen that we just met? Jen to the\n\n01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:49.600\nstage, everybody. Jen. No offense, Adam. But democracy being what it is.\n\n01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:58.480\nHello, Jen. Hey, Jen, how are you? Jen, anything? How's the show been going? Is this your first\n\n01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.480\ntime at the show?\n\n01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:04.400\nNo, I've been going, I think, for the past six weeks, I think. I just moved here in the\n\n01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:09.880\nfall from Arizona. So I came here with my sisters first. So they're big fans, so shout\n\n01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.880\nit to them. They hate me now.\n\n01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.400\nAre your sisters in the back?\n\n01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.640\nNo, they're actually in the UK.\n\n01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:23.720\nOh, okay. They're really in the back. Yeah. In the back of the Atlantic. So, God, now\n\n01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.960\nI have like eight questions for you, though.\n\n01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:30.120\nYou came here from Arizona to do what?\n\n01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.560\nI'm at LMU, where Jamal goes, throwback.\n\n01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.560\nJamal, our post-racial astronaut.\n\n01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:36.560\nYes, I know Jamal.\n\n01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.560\nLoyola Marymount.\n\n01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:40.160\nYes. I'm studying film and TV production.\n\n01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:48.080\nOkay. What's the big dream? If you had your super-duper pie-in-the-sky gig, what would\n\n01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.080\nthat be?\n\n01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.760\nRight now, I really like cinematography. So, cinematographer, maybe, editor, something\n\n01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.760\nlike that.\n\n01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:55.760\nGreat.\n\n01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.560\nYou never know. I'm young, so...\n\n01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.560\nFilm, digital?\n\n01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.560\nYeah.\n\n01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.560\nIt wasn't a guess or no.\n\n01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.560\nYeah.\n\n01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:08.560\nOkay, so, Kurt, you're taking this one. This is your guy again. And then the rest of you,\n\n01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.760\nGod damn it, I forgot our name already.\n\n01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.760\nJen.\n\n01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.760\nJen.\n\n01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.160\nYou are obviously taking Erin McGathy's folder, and Jeff is...\n\n01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.560\nAre you familiar with Mercy, her character?\n\n01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.560\nYes, I am.\n\n01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.560\nGood for you.\n\n01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.560\nI hope I do justice.\n\n01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.560\nThat's for you and Erin, part company.\n\n01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:28.560\nCan I ask very quickly, though, about your sisters being in the UK?\n\n01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:33.560\nYeah, they go to school there. So, my older sister, Amanda, goes to school in London.\n\n01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:34.560\nWhich school?\n\n01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.560\nAnd then, my other sister, University College London.\n\n01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.560\nUniversity of College London?\n\n01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.560\nYes, where it's like, there's no space, like there's no other words, University of College\n\n01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:45.560\nLondon.\n\n01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.560\nGotcha.\n\n01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.560\nRight.\n\n01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:48.560\nShe's a liar.\n\n01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:49.560\nCan you do an English accent?\n\n01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.560\nOh, no.\n\n01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.560\nNo.\n\n01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.560\nNo way.\n\n01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.560\nAnd then my other sister, who's actually my twin, she goes to school in University\n\n01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.560\nof Edinburgh.\n\n01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.560\nOh, really?\n\n01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.560\nYes.\n\n01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.560\nAnd I know how you guys like that city.\n\n01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.560\nCan you do a Scottish accent?\n\n01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.560\nNo.\n\n01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.560\nI can't do it.\n\n01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:12.560\nSo, I have a girlfriend who taught me, there is a mnemonic device, like a children's rhyme,\n\n01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:20.560\nthat takes you through the whole lineage of every monarch of England, from the get-go\n\n01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:21.560\nto the now-go.\n\n01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.560\nI've heard it, but I don't know.\n\n01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.560\nIt's like, there's a Charlie and a Nicky and no get it boogie, but it's cute.\n\n01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.560\nWho could forget King Nicky?\n\n01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.560\nWell, they do.\n\n01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.560\nThey truncate him.\n\n01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:38.560\nIt's like, Addy and Chuck and Pookie and Tuck, and kind of like Pookie, and they're like,\n\n01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:39.560\nwell, that's Peter.\n\n01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.560\nAnd they're like, okay.\n\n01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.560\nIt's kind of amazing, though.\n\n01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.560\nIt's just a weird thing to be part of it.\n\n01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.560\nCan you imagine being part of a country that's older than 200 years?\n\n01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:57.560\nJust weird that you could go back until almost year zero with the people that are part of\n\n01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.560\nit.\n\n01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.560\nWho cares?\n\n01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.560\nShut up.\n\n01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.560\nCan I also add one thing?\n\n01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.560\nI actually, I'm channeling Aaron right now.\n\n01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.560\nI brought cookies.\n\n01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.560\nI just came back.\n\n01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.560\nI got back, like, two hours ago.\n\n01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.560\nI came back down from Mammoth.\n\n01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.560\nI was there this weekend.\n\n01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.560\nAnd I had the people drop me off here, so I could come.\n\n01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:18.560\nWhat kind of cookies are they?\n\n01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:21.560\nLet's get them up here.\n\n01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:26.560\nWe have mixed results with Edibles here.\n\n01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:29.560\nWho is the guy that brought those Christ-Christy ones?\n\n01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.560\nReally?\n\n01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:35.560\nSo the person that brought those Christ-Christy treats, like, my dog ate a tin of them and\n\n01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:40.560\nhad to go to the emergency rich dog drug addict hospital.\n\n01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.560\nBecause he was high as fuck.\n\n01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:50.560\nTo recover from my dog, my dog who probably did not learn his lesson, because he eats\n\n01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:56.560\ncakes off of the middle of the table, ate a tin of pot-raised Christ-Christy treats.\n\n01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.560\nI had one of those, and I was fucking ripped.\n\n01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.560\nI was really, really bad.\n\n01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:06.560\nI had, like, a quarter of a pan of those, and I was just not feeling it.\n\n01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.560\nFor real?\n\n01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.560\nYeah.\n\n01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.560\nLiterally not feeling?\n\n01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.560\nI weigh more than Harvey, though, so.\n\n01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:16.560\nYeah, but, like, you're also a pro.\n\n01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.560\nI'm a lightweight on the marijuana.\n\n01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.560\nCan I correct you on that?\n\n01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:25.560\nHe mostly gets high for charity.\n\n01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.560\nYeah.\n\n01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.560\nIt's really a burden.\n\n01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.560\nHe's not a pro.\n\n01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.560\nI apologize, there's no pot in these cookies.\n\n01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.560\nI bought them, so.\n\n01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.560\nThat's why I'm refraining.\n\n01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.560\nThat's good.\n\n01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.560\nI'll give them to my dog.\n\n01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.560\nYeah, anyone can have them.\n\n01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.560\nI think people were scared that I was trying to poison them, or they just don't like cookies,\n\n01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:43.560\nwhich is the worst option.\n\n01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:44.560\nIt's always possible.\n\n01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.560\nEverybody's worried these days.\n\n01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.560\nEverybody's going to poison everybody.\n\n01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:48.560\nAll right.\n\n01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.560\nYou know what I say?\n\n01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:52.560\nLet them poison each other.\n\n01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:57.560\nAs long as it's not me.\n\n01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:00.560\nSee, that would have been funny if Nate ran out right then, because we would have thought\n\n01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.560\nhe's a reporter.\n\n01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.560\nDan Harmon, soft on poisoning.\n\n01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:07.560\nAll right, Spencer, do you want to?\n\n01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:12.560\nYou know the reason why in Milwaukee we can't go trick-or-treating at night is because\n\n01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:18.560\nof this urban legend about the idea that people put, like, victimized children during trick-or-treat.\n\n01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.560\nAnd it never happened.\n\n01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.560\nLike, the only instances, this is, like, a really impressive thing about our species and\n\n01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:25.560\nour country.\n\n01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:30.560\nLike, 250 million, 300 million people going for 50 years, like, all this shit about, like,\n\n01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.560\noh, there was razor blade in your apple.\n\n01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.560\nThere's a poison in your thing.\n\n01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.560\nTrick-or-treat has been going on every year.\n\n01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.560\nKids don't get hurt.\n\n01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:42.560\nThe only instances, I think, the only documented instances of kids getting poisoned or hurt\n\n01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:47.560\nby, like, tainted or maligned edibles during trick-or-treat.\n\n01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:57.560\nI believe 100% of the cases are a shitty relative of their own home trying to pin fucking child\n\n01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:03.560\nmurder on society, because they hate their children and they poison, like, milk duds and\n\n01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.560\nkill their fucking kid.\n\n01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.560\nAnd everybody's like, is this a theory of yours?\n\n01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.560\nNo, it's not.\n\n01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.560\nThere's, like, only one or two recorded instances when this actually occurred, and it's the\n\n01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:13.560\nparents did it to their own kids.\n\n01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.560\nI don't think there was any deaths, though.\n\n01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.560\nIt was exaggerated, but the kids ended up living and stuff.\n\n01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.560\nWell, I'm thinking, like, often, like, I don't know, it's like, constantly, you see shit,\n\n01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.560\nand then you go, like, ah, man, we're such a fucked-up species.\n\n01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.560\nWe're so fucked up.\n\n01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.560\nBut then, like, you always carry all this shit in your head with, like, oh, a holiday\n\n01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.560\nwhere kids dress up as Pokemons and ask for candy?\n\n01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.560\nMan, how are you going to keep people from coming in those?\n\n01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:41.560\nHow do you know they're not going to come all over the candy and put acid in it and then\n\n01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:46.560\nstab them in the eye with a needle and it's like, they're fucked up places where your\n\n01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.560\nbrain goes.\n\n01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:51.560\nRemember when Duncan was on and we were, like, we were being programmed and he's at the mall\n\n01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:54.560\nand he sees a kid and he's like, should I want to fuck that kid?\n\n01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:59.560\nLike, because we're all like, like, ah, kids are fuckable and you should want to fuck kids\n\n01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.560\nand murder them and kidnap them.\n\n01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.560\nBut it's like, we don't.\n\n01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.560\nWe don't largely do it.\n\n01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.560\nAnd I'm not saying anybody stopped taking any precautions you've been taking, but it's\n\n01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.560\nlike, we don't do it.\n\n01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.560\nThat uplifting, like trick or treat, every year, fucking kids come to the door, open\n\n01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.560\na bag, give me some candy.\n\n01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.560\nNobody fucking does anything bad.\n\n01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:20.560\nDon't start.\n\n01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:23.560\nWe're all right.\n\n01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.560\nWe're all right people.\n\n01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:25.560\nWe're fine.\n\n01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:28.560\nWe're better than giraffes.\n\n01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:34.560\nDo you know how much cum would be on your candy if you trick or treat it in a giraffe neighborhood?\n\n01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:39.560\nGiraffe elephants eat shit out of each other's ass as they take their trunk and they go like,\n\n01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:43.560\nyou're not, you didn't digest all the grass in that, I'm eating it.\n\n01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:48.560\nChimpanzees take a frog and like, fuck, they fuck the frog to death.\n\n01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:55.560\nEverybody but us on this planet, every species but us is a piece of shit murdering horrible\n\n01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.560\nhomicidal sociopath.\n\n01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:03.560\nWhat the crowd listening at home doesn't know is everyone else has left the building.\n\n01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.560\nWe're good, we're good people.\n\n01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.560\nWe have our moments.\n\n01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.560\nI'm saying that if you knew that some giraffes lived next door to you, you wouldn't go trick or treating\n\n01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:11.560\nat the house.\n\n01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.560\nIt's not.\n\n01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.560\nI wouldn't.\n\n01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.560\nI would not.\n\n01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.560\nYou think giraffes would have that much malice aforethought that they would cum all over\n\n01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:20.560\nyour snickers?\n\n01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.560\nYes.\n\n01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:22.560\nYes, I do.\n\n01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.560\nIs that what you're saying, Dan?\n\n01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.560\nYes, yes, I do.\n\n01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:26.560\nOr they would eat me.\n\n01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.560\nThey would put something, they would put some, if they're sentient giraffes.\n\n01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:30.560\nOkay.\n\n01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:31.560\nI don't want to go near that.\n\n01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:32.560\nGiraffes are sentient.\n\n01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.560\nGiraffes are not sentient.\n\n01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.560\nThey're not?\n\n01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:40.560\nWell, okay, if they are, then I'm glad that there's none here.\n\n01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:46.560\nI would avoid a sentient animal like the plague, because if they're not forthcoming with their\n\n01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.560\nsentience, if they're not going like, hey, over here, I'm sentient, I don't trust them.\n\n01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.560\nAnd that includes these fucking dolphins.\n\n01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.560\nDo you pronounce plague, plague, like baggle?\n\n01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:58.560\nDid you just say plague, like the plague?\n\n01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:01.560\nI think sometimes that you're part giraffe.\n\n01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:06.560\nThat's fucking, come all over you.\n\n01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:09.560\nAll right, Spencer, if you would, please catch us up and bring us up to date.\n\n01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.560\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.560\nGirl of Shadowrun.\n\n01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:12.560\nOkay.\n\n01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.560\nUh.\n\n01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:14.560\nTeeth.\n\n01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:24.060\nLast run on Shadowtime.\n\n01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:30.560\nOur heroes had not found Baldwin Brown, but were still en route to the neutral drop zone.\n\n01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:37.560\nThere they met with Mr. Johnson, who was less than pleased by not having Baldwin Brown in his clutches.\n\n01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.560\nHowever, Dr. Friend eased him over with an agony spell on himself.\n\n01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:46.560\nAnd after some strict negotiations by, uh, what's her name?\n\n01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:52.560\nMercy O'Donnell, things were smoothed over until the cops showed up.\n\n01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:58.560\nIt was time to bone out and Eve used a flaming gorilla illusion spell to cover their escape\n\n01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.560\nwhile they boned out in the semi truck with the Johnson.\n\n01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.560\nBut without Baldwin, what would they do?\n\n01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.560\nWhat would they get paid from?\n\n01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.560\nWill they find him instead?\n\n01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.560\nAll right.\n\n01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.560\nThat's over.\n\n01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:23.560\nYou know, you don't, if you don't feel it deserves an applause, you don't need to applaud.\n\n01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:24.560\nI'm just saying.\n\n01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.560\nIt's fair.\n\n01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.560\nEither way.\n\n01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.560\nThat's how I feel.\n\n01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.560\nYou're in the barrens.\n\n01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.560\nIt's early morning.\n\n01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.560\nLet's say three or four in the morning.\n\n01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.560\nYou're in a semi truck full of BTLs with the Johnson.\n\n01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.560\nYou think you've evaded the cops.\n\n01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:44.560\nYou're on an empty road winding through fields of rubble towards a building said to be hiding Baldwin Brown.\n\n01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.560\nOh, we know.\n\n01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:46.560\nYeah.\n\n01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:51.560\nMy eagle spotted him in that building and there's a magical, uh, mana barriers inside there.\n\n01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.560\nLike, uh, magic barriers inside the building.\n\n01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.560\nMana barriers.\n\n01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.560\nYep.\n\n01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:56.560\nAll right.\n\n01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:59.560\nI can take care of that shit.\n\n01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.560\nCan you?\n\n01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.560\nHuh?\n\n01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.560\nWell, whatever.\n\n01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.560\nDon't doubt me, Spencer.\n\n01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.560\nOkay.\n\n01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.560\nI believe in you.\n\n01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.560\nThank you, Mercy.\n\n01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:12.560\nWe should drive until we arrive at this place.\n\n01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.560\nAll right.\n\n01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:14.560\nI like it.\n\n01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.560\nAre we all in the back of a big truck?\n\n01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:19.560\nYou're, narratively, you could be positioned wherever you want.\n\n01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.560\nIt'll, it'll all work out.\n\n01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.560\nAs I was confused about that last week.\n\n01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:24.560\nYeah.\n\n01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:25.560\nWell, last week you were in the front.\n\n01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:26.560\nYeah.\n\n01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:32.560\nThe semi truck, there's a, they call it the cab and then they call it the Holland box,\n\n01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:33.560\nI think.\n\n01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.560\nThe bed.\n\n01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:35.560\nOh.\n\n01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.560\nYeah.\n\n01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:37.560\nAll right.\n\n01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:38.560\nI'm in the Holland box.\n\n01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:39.560\nAll right.\n\n01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.560\nMe too.\n\n01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.560\nMe too.\n\n01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:42.560\nYeah.\n\n01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.560\nOkay.\n\n01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.560\nI believe horticard.\n\n01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:45.560\nHorticard and Mercy, I think, are up front, right?\n\n01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:46.560\nYeah.\n\n01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.560\nIn the passenger seat.\n\n01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:48.560\nYou could be wherever you want to be.\n\n01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.560\nAm I using, uh, my sort of, uh, my sense of where we are going to get there?\n\n01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:53.560\nOh yeah.\n\n01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.560\nYou got a map, it's in your brain.\n\n01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.560\nYou know everywhere you're going.\n\n01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:58.560\nSo we have a program.\n\n01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:06.560\nWe will arrive, uh, according to, uh, uh, my sequencing, uh, I would request an estimation\n\n01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.560\non how long before we arrive.\n\n01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:09.560\nSay what?\n\n01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:12.560\nHow much time before we get there?\n\n01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:13.560\nOh.\n\n01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:15.560\nWell, you're getting there right now.\n\n01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:16.560\nSay what?\n\n01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.560\nArriving now and stopping.\n\n01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:19.560\nDefinitely.\n\n01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:20.560\nOkay.\n\n01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.560\nWe're almost there.\n\n01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:25.560\nAs you get closer, you pass more and more intact buildings, run down as they are.\n\n01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:30.560\nAnd also people in the early morning light congregating or standing around in the street.\n\n01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:34.560\nSmall barrel fires cast a warm flickering light across the streets.\n\n01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.560\nThe truck rolls up to a stop.\n\n01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:39.560\nUm, the building is just down the block.\n\n01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:42.560\nUnless you want to like roll up to the front of it, but you know, usually.\n\n01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.560\nYeah.\n\n01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.560\nI said we, we don't park right in front of it.\n\n01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:47.560\nYeah.\n\n01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.560\nSo that's where you're parked.\n\n01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:50.560\nNot right up in front of it.\n\n01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:57.560\nCan you use your sense to find out, uh, can horticard like locate where Baldwin Brown is inside this building?\n\n01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:05.560\nUh, no, but I, uh, it's in my collection of mental maps.\n\n01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.560\nDo I have some sort of layout of the, of the building available to me?\n\n01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.560\nNot really.\n\n01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.560\nYou just, it just looks like a small building.\n\n01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:19.560\nShould I astral project myself inside that building and try to get like sense where the barriers are and where, uh, where Baldwin is?\n\n01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:20.560\nWho are you asking?\n\n01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.560\nI'm the group though.\n\n01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:22.560\nYou guys okay with that?\n\n01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.560\nOr you want to try another plan?\n\n01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:29.560\nI was going to give him a, I was going to give him a, uh, a strength boost that might help him find Baldwin Brown.\n\n01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.560\nWho?\n\n01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.560\nIn the building.\n\n01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560\nWho?\n\n01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.560\nUm, what's your name?\n\n01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:35.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:40.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:41.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:43.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:44.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.560\nHorticard.\n\n01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.560\nI was going to give him a, a strength boost.\n\n01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:49.560\nDo it.\n\n01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:50.560\nOkay.\n\n01:32:50.560 --> 01:33:01.560\nThis guy's a really good doctor.\n\n01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:11.560\nAnd with that his strength is boosted.\n\n01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:15.560\nSo feeling, uh, very strong now?\n\n01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:18.560\nYou're feeling three stronger.\n\n01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.560\nThat's, uh, kind of a bad neighborhood.\n\n01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.560\nSome ways you stay with the goods.\n\n01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:27.560\nNot the kind of people you want to valet park with.\n\n01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.560\nOkay.\n\n01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:32.560\nIf you give my meaning.\n\n01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:39.560\nIf you ask for a project, uh, perhaps I could, uh, create some sort of mind melt between us and then we could stay in contact.\n\n01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:40.560\nOkay.\n\n01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.560\nWhile you're gone.\n\n01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:47.560\nI asked for a project into the building and try to try to locate where Baldwin is with a mind meld.\n\n01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:49.560\nMind meld communication with horticard.\n\n01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:50.560\nOkay.\n\n01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:51.560\nThat happens.\n\n01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:52.560\nYou're in astral form.\n\n01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:56.560\nYou, uh, you glide over the buildings.\n\n01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:06.560\nYou glide over two large parking structures that are broken and damaged with the ravages of time and in between them nestled in a tiny, tiny spot, almost too small for a property.\n\n01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:12.560\nYou see, you see a vintage wooden house standing bright and cheery, squeezed in the tiny lot.\n\n01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:17.560\nYou see the house is made out of real live walnut wood blanks and a wood shingled roof.\n\n01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:20.560\nIt's a real throwback to the older times.\n\n01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.560\nIt's yard is overgrown with plants and it's glowing.\n\n01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.560\nYou can see it with your astral vision.\n\n01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.560\nIt's glowing as you try and enter the house.\n\n01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:31.560\nYou're repulsed by a strong mana barrier force.\n\n01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:34.560\nIt's, uh, it's, it's blocking all astral travel.\n\n01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:35.560\nAll right.\n\n01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:39.560\nIs it glowing from the mana barrier?\n\n01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:40.560\nThe barrier is glowing.\n\n01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.560\nRight.\n\n01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.560\nUm, and there's no way for me to get through that?\n\n01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.560\nNot astral style.\n\n01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:56.560\nUm, attacking barriers, can I take out, like, how do you attack, can I attack those with my astral, with my, um, with my war club?\n\n01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.560\nYou can try, but it's a tough barrier.\n\n01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.560\nYou can tell by looking at it.\n\n01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:06.560\nI, I use my, uh, my combat focus weapon, my, uh, my Comanche War Club, and I try to attack the barrier.\n\n01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.560\nOkay.\n\n01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.560\nHey, you all right?\n\n01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:13.560\nYou look like you're getting astrally blocked.\n\n01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:16.560\nCan we communicate through comments when I'm astral?\n\n01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.560\nNo, you're just a ghost.\n\n01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.560\nYou could talk to horde guard though.\n\n01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.560\nI would like to relay a question from you.\n\n01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:22.560\nWhat is it?\n\n01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.560\nAre you all right?\n\n01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:24.560\nI don't, I'm so far so good.\n\n01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.560\nThere's a barrier here.\n\n01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.560\nShould I try to, should I try to smack it?\n\n01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.560\nUh, I would smack, yes?\n\n01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.560\nOkay, okay.\n\n01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:32.560\nWhy would you not?\n\n01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:40.560\nI, uh, I take my Comanche War Club and harness my, uh, my club's astral attack on it.\n\n01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.560\nStriking with the astral form of your club, it pings harmlessly off the barrier surface.\n\n01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.560\nThis is some higher level magics.\n\n01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:52.560\nOkay, I go back to the, to the group.\n\n01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.560\nFor the record, he says he is all right.\n\n01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.560\nYes, I'm all right.\n\n01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.560\nOkay, so guys, there's a, there's a, there's a big mana barrier.\n\n01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:01.560\nIt's magic that's beyond my capabilities.\n\n01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.560\nI don't, I don't know how to get through that.\n\n01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.560\nOh, well, you know what they say.\n\n01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:09.560\nUh, what, what do they say?\n\n01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:22.560\nBigger the mana barrier, lower the, uh, the defense against conventional, uh, assault.\n\n01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:27.560\nI assume.\n\n01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.560\nOkay, can I, can I counter spell against it?\n\n01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:32.560\nUh, no.\n\n01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:33.560\nShit.\n\n01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:37.560\nCould I give him a spell that would increase his body size?\n\n01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.560\nHer.\n\n01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.560\nI'm a she.\n\n01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.560\nSorry?\n\n01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:41.560\nI'm a girl.\n\n01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.560\nI'm so, I'm sorry.\n\n01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:44.560\nIt's all right.\n\n01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:45.560\nMy name is Ewe World.\n\n01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:46.560\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:47.560\nI didn't know that.\n\n01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:48.560\nYou could, yeah.\n\n01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:49.560\nYou have to ask.\n\n01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:50.560\nIt's a callback.\n\n01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:58.560\nCamera two, camera three, camera one, camera four.\n\n01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:05.560\nHarvett Charles is brought to you by Snuggles Fabris Offender.\n\n01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:09.560\nIf you casted the increased body and make him tougher to kill and more resilient.\n\n01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.560\nBut it won't help him get through the barrier.\n\n01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:12.560\nNot on its own.\n\n01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.560\nNo.\n\n01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.560\nOkay.\n\n01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:17.560\nCould, uh, perhaps it be, uh, what is it that you have?\n\n01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:20.560\nYou have a sort of a light whip?\n\n01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:21.560\nYeah.\n\n01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:22.560\nWhip.\n\n01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:23.560\nYeah.\n\n01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:24.560\nYeah.\n\n01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.560\nNano whip in my finger.\n\n01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.560\nYeah.\n\n01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.560\nIs it, is it, uh, is that sort of barrier?\n\n01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:33.560\nIs it sort of, uh, vulnerable to, uh, to the whip?\n\n01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:36.560\nUh, okay.\n\n01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.560\nYou look that question up on the future net.\n\n01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:42.560\nWait, it's called the matrix in this game.\n\n01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.560\nYou look it up on the matrix and you find out that mana barriers are not affected by\n\n01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.560\nphysical manner.\n\n01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:50.560\nDoes somebody stay here and, uh, protect the gear?\n\n01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.560\nUh, I should head in there.\n\n01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.560\nIt seems like, uh, also, I mean, I could go in there.\n\n01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.560\nI have mana spells.\n\n01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:00.560\nI could go in there and cast like a high level, uh, mana bolt and try to knock it out that\n\n01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:01.560\nway too.\n\n01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:03.560\nBut I am getting a little drained.\n\n01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:05.560\nHave I rested or do I still have the drain?\n\n01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.560\nNo, you're still drained.\n\n01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:07.560\nOkay.\n\n01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.560\nI've got a few, I have a few bits of drain left in me.\n\n01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.560\nYeah, you're about half.\n\n01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:23.560\nThat's what the people on the streets are saying things.\n\n01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:26.560\nSo do we know the security system on the outside of the building?\n\n01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:30.560\nNo, you only have seen the wooden exterior of the house.\n\n01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.560\nOh yeah, you're a hacker, right?\n\n01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.560\nLike, no.\n\n01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:36.560\nI have a key card copier.\n\n01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.560\nThat's true.\n\n01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:41.560\nAnd I also have an auto picker, which I would think would be locks.\n\n01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:46.560\nUm, I go and inspect the front door or entrance to the building.\n\n01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.560\nYou cross through the green yard and past the yellow mailbox that has the name the\n\n01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:52.560\nyellowman's painted on the side.\n\n01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:55.560\nYou go up to the front door that's painted blue.\n\n01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.560\nThe woods, I mean, the paint is shipping.\n\n01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.560\nIt's old as hell, but it's a classic throwback lock.\n\n01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:03.560\nYou could definitely pick it with that lock picker.\n\n01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.560\nI pick it with, I pick the lock.\n\n01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.560\nAlright.\n\n01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:08.560\nCan I be following her?\n\n01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:13.560\nNo, as well, because I watched my magic friends fail to, so I, we're leaving the\n\n01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:19.560\nHolland, Holland truck and I'm going to go into, going with the physical people.\n\n01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.560\nI will follow, I will follow as well, but behind.\n\n01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.560\nRear guard for protection.\n\n01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.560\nThank you.\n\n01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.560\nI'm staying, I'm staying in the car.\n\n01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.560\nAlright.\n\n01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:32.560\nI'm, I'm inside the truck, but I'm still going to be in the astral plane right now\n\n01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.560\nkind of overseeing things.\n\n01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.560\nI'm telling you, somebody should, somebody should stay with the truck.\n\n01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.560\nIt's like a joke in an 80s movie.\n\n01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:39.560\nWe're going to come back.\n\n01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:44.560\nIt's going to be on blocks.\n\n01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.560\nIt's a bad neighborhood.\n\n01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.560\nThis guy likes cookies.\n\n01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:52.560\nThey're pretty dry, but they're good.\n\n01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:55.560\nSpeaking of dry, can I have a water?\n\n01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:57.560\nIt's because of him.\n\n01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:58.560\nNate?\n\n01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.560\nNate, right?\n\n01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.560\nSpencer has one.\n\n01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.560\nDoes Spencer have a water?\n\n01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.560\nYeah.\n\n01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.560\nThere you go.\n\n01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.560\nHe was in my pocket.\n\n01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:06.560\nAlright, so the, so the little worm, but it's still what?\n\n01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:09.560\nThe mana barrier is not covering the outside of the house.\n\n01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:10.560\nIt's covering the whole house.\n\n01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.560\nIt is.\n\n01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:12.560\nIt's like, it's like paint.\n\n01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:14.560\nSo what, what lock is she picking the one on the house itself?\n\n01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.560\nFront door.\n\n01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.560\nYup.\n\n01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.560\nOkay.\n\n01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:20.560\nSo is the chipped paint mean that, that portion is down?\n\n01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.560\nNope.\n\n01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:24.560\nI'm in a like paint in that it covered the entire thing.\n\n01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:25.560\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:26.560\nThat's confusing.\n\n01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:35.560\nYou pick the door and it slides open silently, which is odd for an old wooden house.\n\n01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.560\nIs the barrier still there?\n\n01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:40.560\nWell, she, no, no, you can only see it when you're in the astral plane.\n\n01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.560\nNo one else can see any barriers.\n\n01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.560\nOkay.\n\n01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.560\nIt's like an astral barrier.\n\n01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:50.560\nI would like to use my sense of detecting enemies to see if there are any enemies I can detect.\n\n01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:54.560\nYou detect two enemies inside.\n\n01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:58.560\nBut with any sort of specificity location?\n\n01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.560\nNo, all you could do is detect your presence.\n\n01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.560\nThe number is two, there are two enemies.\n\n01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.560\nThanks.\n\n01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:09.560\nAll right, well, get ready to change that number.\n\n01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.560\nMeaning there are three?\n\n01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.560\nWhat?\n\n01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:13.560\nWhat?\n\n01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.560\nA rare joke from Horthegard.\n\n01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.560\nNo, I don't mean change it.\n\n01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.560\nDon't change it randomly.\n\n01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:23.560\nI'm going to change it by killing people.\n\n01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.560\nThat's a guy.\n\n01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:30.560\nI go back to the truck, go back into the physical world, and I say, guys, there's a mana barrier.\n\n01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:34.560\nYou're not getting in there. There's a magical force field around this house.\n\n01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.560\nYou're not getting in there.\n\n01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:38.560\nWell, I guess you're talking to a friend because everyone else is outside the truck.\n\n01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:39.560\nThat's right.\n\n01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:40.560\nI'm the only one who stayed in the truck.\n\n01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:41.560\nNot on comm links?\n\n01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:42.560\nI can't say that.\n\n01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:43.560\nOh, sure.\n\n01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.560\nYeah.\n\n01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.560\nI report that on comm to everybody.\n\n01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.560\nThat happens.\n\n01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:48.560\nWhy don't you guys get to know each other?\n\n01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:54.560\nJust suggesting as a player, like, it could be a fun scene.\n\n01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:55.560\nMe and the doctor?\n\n01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.560\nYeah.\n\n01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:04.560\nHey, doc, remember what you said back there about, you know, me maybe.\n\n01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:05.560\nYou could have done better than this.\n\n01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.560\nI could have done better than this.\n\n01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:12.560\nYou know, it's hard because, you know, we live in this world that just every step you take seems like a step back.\n\n01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:20.560\nEvery time you do something, it wants to, it just reinforces the fact that you're not supposed to be free and not supposed to be happy.\n\n01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:22.560\nAnd like, I've never felt like I deserve happiness.\n\n01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.560\nIt's not true.\n\n01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:30.560\nYou're a decent girl.\n\n01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:32.560\nYou could have anything.\n\n01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:35.560\nI just don't want your life to be like mine.\n\n01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.560\nI want to find my parents.\n\n01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:45.560\nMy parents are stuck working for mega corporations and their magic is being used like prostituted.\n\n01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:51.560\nI know, I know.\n\n01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:54.560\nThey didn't even know if I'm alive or dead, doc.\n\n01:42:54.560 --> 01:43:08.560\nLook, I don't know if you know anything about me, but I used to be a very well respected doctor.\n\n01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:10.560\nWhat happened?\n\n01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:14.560\nDo you remember when the president was shot?\n\n01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:15.560\nYes.\n\n01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:19.560\nI was the doctor who attempted to save his life.\n\n01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.560\nWow.\n\n01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.560\nBut I'd been drinking.\n\n01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:30.560\nHe died on the table under my hands.\n\n01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.560\nIt destroyed me.\n\n01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:39.560\nI just went from bad to worse after that and then I wound up here with these people.\n\n01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:46.560\nI'm just telling you, thank you, I'm just telling you that you could save yourself now.\n\n01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.560\nGo find your parents.\n\n01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:49.560\nStart your life all over again.\n\n01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:53.560\nWhat you're telling me is that you found yourself at the bottom of the barrel just like the rest of us.\n\n01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.560\nWe're nobody's, we're nothing's.\n\n01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:01.560\nI'm more of a nothing than you are.\n\n01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:09.560\nMaybe you should take your own advice and put some of that healing power on your own soul, your own self.\n\n01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:12.560\nMaybe you're right.\n\n01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.560\nI kissed the doctor.\n\n01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:21.560\nOkay.\n\n01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:25.560\nWe start really making that.\n\n01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:30.560\nStop, they're coming.\n\n01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:35.560\nWe're not coming.\n\n01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:39.560\nBut you may have forgot to turn off your comlink.\n\n01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.560\nOh shit God damn it.\n\n01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.560\nOh my God, that's embarrassing.\n\n01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:45.560\nHow much did you guys hear?\n\n01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:46.560\nHow much did you guys hear?\n\n01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:47.560\nAll of it.\n\n01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:48.560\nOh shit.\n\n01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.560\n100%\n\n01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:53.560\nCan I just say we're all shadow runners?\n\n01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:57.560\nYou know, the stuff, the themes I'm hearing, I've heard on a lot of shadow runs.\n\n01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:00.560\nYou know, we are all misfits.\n\n01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:07.560\nI don't think there's anyone that should be saying to anybody else, you know, you more than me.\n\n01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.560\nIt's like, come on, this is the life we chose.\n\n01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:10.560\nHey, you know what guys?\n\n01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:11.560\nOkay.\n\n01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.560\nLittle pow wow.\n\n01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.560\nEverybody huddle up.\n\n01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:16.560\nWell we can't, we're at the house.\n\n01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:20.560\nOkay, I go.\n\n01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:21.560\nOkay, comlink huddle up.\n\n01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:23.560\nLet's just just comlink huddle up.\n\n01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:27.560\nEverybody pretend you're in a physical huddle.\n\n01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.560\nWe're the bottom of the barrel.\n\n01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.560\nBut we have a job to do.\n\n01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:39.560\nAnd everything that we do right from here on forward gets us a little bit higher, makes us a little bit better people.\n\n01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:43.560\nI don't know who this guy, Mr. Johnson, is, or what he wants from Baldwin Brown.\n\n01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.560\nYeah, should I be on this call or not?\n\n01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.560\nOh, shit.\n\n01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.560\nWait, is he listening the whole time?\n\n01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:50.560\nYeah.\n\n01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:52.560\nBaldwin Brown?\n\n01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.560\nNo, wait, Johnson.\n\n01:45:54.560 --> 01:46:01.560\nWho keeps hitting send all?\n\n01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:07.560\nIt's a lot like sort of this joke that we have about the Norwegian family.\n\n01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:11.560\nWhere for example, maybe this one comes from Stavanger.\n\n01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:14.560\nAnd maybe this one comes from Bergen.\n\n01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:17.560\nAnd maybe this one comes from Trondheim.\n\n01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:19.560\nI am of course from Oslo.\n\n01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:22.560\nAnd this one is the angry one.\n\n01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:24.560\nAngry at the oil is being taken from his place.\n\n01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:26.560\nHe has all the money in the world.\n\n01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.560\nBut it's being sent to other places in Norway.\n\n01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.560\nBut we're all one family.\n\n01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.560\nAnd end of story.\n\n01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.560\nSo for precision sake, we're all one family.\n\n01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:42.560\nThanks for dumbing that down for us.\n\n01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.560\nI really clarified it.\n\n01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:49.560\nI go back into the Astral Plane and I go at it and I throw a Force V mana bolt at the barrier.\n\n01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.560\nOkay.\n\n01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:53.560\nWhat's your magic plus spell casting?\n\n01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:56.560\nSeven and plus six.\n\n01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:59.560\nI think the mana barrier is just a thing that's there.\n\n01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:04.560\nIt strikes it and absorbs into the mana barrier's surface.\n\n01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.560\nThe end?\n\n01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:07.560\nI mean what?\n\n01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.560\nThat's it.\n\n01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.560\nThat's it for that mana bolt.\n\n01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.560\nBut not for this story.\n\n01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:16.560\nTime for action.\n\n01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:20.560\nFight gun engaged.\n\n01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:21.560\nAlright.\n\n01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:22.560\nEve?\n\n01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.560\nIs that her name?\n\n01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:24.560\nYep.\n\n01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:25.560\nAlright.\n\n01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:26.560\nCome out to the coast.\n\n01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.560\nHave a few laughs.\n\n01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:32.560\nI've got two bogies somewhere in here.\n\n01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:34.560\nI sweep the room.\n\n01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:35.560\nI take him by surroundings.\n\n01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.560\nWhat do I see?\n\n01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.560\nYou see the front room.\n\n01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:40.560\nThere's two large couches and all sorts of framed photos.\n\n01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:42.560\nAnd light coming in from the kitchen.\n\n01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:43.560\nWell he's in the room?\n\n01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:44.560\nApparently.\n\n01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:45.560\nWhat's the point of that?\n\n01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:47.560\nYou can walk through a mana barrier.\n\n01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:51.560\nMotherfucker, you don't have to.\n\n01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:53.560\nOh, so it just keeps out magic?\n\n01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:54.560\nIt keeps out magic.\n\n01:47:54.560 --> 01:48:00.560\nI don't know everything about magic, you guys.\n\n01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:03.560\nAgain the people from the streets?\n\n01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560\nThey know.\n\n01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:06.560\nStreet smarts.\n\n01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:07.560\nI check my zones.\n\n01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.560\nI check my zones.\n\n01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.560\nYeah, you see light coming from the kitchen and you hear movement.\n\n01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:19.560\nYou see an old lady ruffling around in the fridge.\n\n01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:20.560\nShe doesn't seem to notice you.\n\n01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:24.560\nIt must be your intense stealth capabilities.\n\n01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.560\nOr she's a robot.\n\n01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:33.560\nJust like my parents.\n\n01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.560\nI holster my weapon.\n\n01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:36.560\nAlright.\n\n01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:41.560\nAnd I use my social skills.\n\n01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:45.560\nWhat do you do with them?\n\n01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:48.560\nHey mom.\n\n01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:49.560\nJesse?\n\n01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:51.560\nIs that you?\n\n01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:53.560\nYeah, it's me, Jersey.\n\n01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:56.560\nAre you home, Jesse?\n\n01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:02.560\nYes, I'm home.\n\n01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.560\nOh, it's been so long, my eyes.\n\n01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:06.560\nThey're not good.\n\n01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:07.560\nI brought a girl with me.\n\n01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:08.560\nI hope it's okay.\n\n01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:11.560\nI know you're old fashioned, but times are changing.\n\n01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:12.560\nAlright.\n\n01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:15.560\nJust have fun down in the basement like you always do.\n\n01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.560\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.560\nI go back in physical form again.\n\n01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:20.560\nOkay.\n\n01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:22.560\nYou're in the truck, right?\n\n01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:25.560\nI go back and join him, I think, right?\n\n01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:26.560\nWhat's going on with you?\n\n01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:27.560\nI don't know.\n\n01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:28.560\nYou said you brought a girl.\n\n01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.560\nYou meant me?\n\n01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:30.560\nNo, I meant...\n\n01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:31.560\nOh, Mercy.\n\n01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:32.560\nOkay, I'm in the truck.\n\n01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:33.560\nAlright.\n\n01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:39.560\nBeing very embarrassed about the whole Man of Barrier experience.\n\n01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:40.560\nAlright.\n\n01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:44.560\nSo you said that there were two people in the room?\n\n01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:47.560\nTwo enemies were scouted in the house.\n\n01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:49.560\nOkay.\n\n01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:52.560\nSo I'm going to put on my spy monocle.\n\n01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.560\nAlright.\n\n01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:57.560\nWhat's the setup of the lower level of the house?\n\n01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:02.560\nThe kitchen leads to the basement for some reason.\n\n01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:06.560\nI use my stealth to get by the grandma.\n\n01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:12.560\nAnd I go down into the basement and I use my spy monocle to see my surroundings.\n\n01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:13.560\nAlright.\n\n01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:20.560\nIt's really dark, but you can see two sleeping figures and a small metallic dome in the darkness.\n\n01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.560\nThey're sleeping in the basement.\n\n01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.560\nThey're not in the dome.\n\n01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:25.560\nThe dome is separate.\n\n01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:26.560\nIt's nearby.\n\n01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:28.560\nI head down the stairs as well.\n\n01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:31.560\nI draw my Aries predator.\n\n01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:32.560\nYou do that.\n\n01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:33.560\nSilence or equipped?\n\n01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:35.560\nDoes anyone else do anything?\n\n01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.560\nI am in the kitchen right now.\n\n01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.560\nI think you're outside the house probably.\n\n01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.560\nWell, then I enter the house.\n\n01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:45.560\nThe old lady's like, oh, Jesse, Scott's some friends.\n\n01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:48.560\nJust tell her you're Jesse's friends.\n\n01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:56.560\nI tell her I am a friend of Jesse's and I'm just outside waiting for him to grab his effects.\n\n01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:57.560\nOkay.\n\n01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:59.560\nWould you like a coffee?\n\n01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:04.560\nLet me use my power to analyze truth to see if this is really coffee.\n\n01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:05.560\nIt is.\n\n01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:06.560\nIt is.\n\n01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:12.560\nI will enjoy coffee.\n\n01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.560\nYou got to take the coffee or should I?\n\n01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.560\nBut will he really enjoy the coffee?\n\n01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:21.560\nFind out next time on Shadow Rock.\n\n01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:27.560\nCliff Hanger!\n\n01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:32.560\nAll right.\n\n01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:33.560\nThank you so much, Jen, everybody.\n\n01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:40.560\nJen helping us out at Mercy.\n\n01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:56.560\nSo now you're an asshole if you don't.\n\n01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:00.560\nAnd next week we're going to go in that house and kick a whole ton of ass in there, right?\n\n01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:01.560\nYeah.\n\n01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:02.560\nAll right.\n\n01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:03.560\nThank you, everybody.\n\n01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:06.560\nDan Harmon, your mayor, everybody.\n\n01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:11.560\nThank you, Chris and Zach and Dustin back in the booth.\n\n01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:13.560\nAnd we'll see you next week.\n\n01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.560\nOh, and watch King of the Nerds on Fridays on TBS.\n\n01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:16.560\nThat's right.\n\n01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:21.560\nFinale on Friday, 9 o'clock.\n\n01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:23.560\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:28.560\nIt's a good show.\n\n01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:38.560\nFeral
