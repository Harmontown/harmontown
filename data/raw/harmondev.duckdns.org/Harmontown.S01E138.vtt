00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the NerdMelt Theater, Harmontown is now in

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
session.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:20.000 --> 00:29.000
Thank you.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Thank you so much.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Such kind people.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
You're such warm hearted, supportive people.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
You put a lot of faith in me.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
I don't want to let you down.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
But it won't be a good show tonight.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
It's not going to be a good show.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Why is that?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm busy.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
And I'm tired.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
And I'm not very talented.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
And I don't make plans.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
And then I come up on stage and it's like, what am I going to talk about?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
I don't know what I'm going to talk about.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
In case why, Dan, I disagree with you about tonight's show.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I think it's going to be a good one.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Because tonight you're drinking out of glass as opposed to a red solo cup.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
And I think that automatically steps up the class factor.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I think I wrote one thing in my notepad.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
See, I knew it.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Let's see.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh, there is a surprise later tonight.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
I'm going to take this dick out.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
By the way, Dan, while you're looking that up,

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
people that play music and like music,

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
because we can't play licensed music anymore,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
I have to play stuff that people either donate to us or that is free

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
so that we don't get in trouble now that we're charging people.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
So if you want to or you know somebody that plays music

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
and wants to play something kick-ass to start off the show,

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
go to Harmontownmusic.tumblr.com

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
and all the info will be there to have a song that we can play to start off the show

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
and play throughout the show.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
So if you know somebody, please give it.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Because that song is by a band called Knife to Meet You.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Knife.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Real Knife.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Real Knife.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah, that's Harold Knife and his girlfriend Cindy Meats.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
See?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Cindy Meats?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
You thought I was being self-deprecating.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I'm just a journalist.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Why are you so tired, Harmon?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm working.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm going to go back to the office after this.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm locking episode 604.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Take us to the last 48 hours of your life.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
What have you done?

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Well, I went to Yahoo in San Jose over the weekend.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
They had us come out.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
I think it was Friday.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
We went and flew to San Jose and then drove to this weird spaceship

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
in the middle of the desert where these thousands and thousands of Yahoo people

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
like work and it's crazy over there.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
And they had, you know, it was just like a sort of like a drop into there.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
They have like a fireside chat every Friday where the CEO, Marissa Meyer,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
like conducts this like whole thing and you can Reddit style.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
You can like type in, I think, anonymous questions and they get upvoted or downvoted.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
It's sort of like a closed circuit Reddit for AMA that she does every week.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
So if you have like a beef with your paycheck or something,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
you can like, like, what the fuck's with my paycheck?

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
And if everyone's like, yeah, what the fuck's up with the paycheck?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
And she'll be like, what the fuck's up with the paycheck?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Okay, so here's the thing.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
You don't get one, but listen, I don't know.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
You get a free email address.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Look under your seat.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
And so it's like that.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
So they have like guests that are like people that work at different departments

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
come up and do this thing and it's all like a big kind of pump you up Yahoo thing.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
And they have purple beer.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
I'm boring myself.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
The purple beer is really good.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I have nothing bad to say about Yahoo.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Is it purple for a reason or is it just dyed purple because it's called...

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Well, it's made with blueberries or something.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
So I think there's some purple that's justified,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
but I think overall probably they just put cancerous dye in it, right?

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
I mean, I don't think anything that's supposed to be a color is ever that color.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Is Yahoo your employer of putting cancer in their beer?

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Yes.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I'm just saying like when things are orange because you feel like they should be orange,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
they're not usually orange.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Like cheddar cheese or something.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah, like, you know, we rarely, you know, see things the way...

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
Somebody told me that air conditioning, in the air conditioning industry,

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
like there's a worldwide conspiracy to make the 69 degrees in your car

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
either warmer or colder than real 69 degrees

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
because human beings have a certain temperature that they think is 69 degrees

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
and it doesn't match what's real 69 degrees.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
Somebody told me that when we were doing the AC repair things in community.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
Anyways, our movie was just broke on Netflix,

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
and you can tell because, yes, please, Netflix is here.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
I mean, is that why you're drinking out of a glass?

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Well, you can tell from the volume of tweets of people saying,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
I just watched the Harmontown documentary kind of really shot up.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
I don't think Netflix is, I think they've got a real sizable lemonade stand going over there.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
I think they might be flixing some nets.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
I think they might have some viewership that Netflix.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
Is Sydney Meats there?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Sydney Meats.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Alright, so are you almost through the woods with a community?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Are you almost through with the writing?

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
Why don't you play the family song?

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Family song?

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
I'll get my own.

06:02.000 --> 06:10.000
From the day I went to you, I knew it was true

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
And I saw your eyes and you knew what you saw was true

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
Family, you are what we need

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Put your bomb in the body, in the body, in the shoe

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
Fuck you, mama

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
Family, put your bomb in the bucket, in the bucket, in the shoe

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Family, family is where you are

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
Put your bomb in the bucket, in the body, in the shoe

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
Oh, wait, wait, wait

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Was MC John about to come out?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Seemed like it, seemed like it.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
You gotta start over though.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
But here's the thing with that song though, it starts right on the nugget

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
And then I start a measure in, I don't know, do you call it a measure?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
A bar, yeah.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
You can tell from the music that I'm a bar off, you know what I mean?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Because I'm like doing my set up.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
It goes like one, two, three, four, it starts right on the one.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
So that's a toughie.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Whoever wrote that song, you failed.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Let it go four or eight bars before you jump in.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Really?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
So go like, yeah, just hype it up for a bit.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Okay, so it's like, so you start it.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Okay, let's try it out.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Okay.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah, alright, here we go.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Ready?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Check it out.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Oh, so I start there?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Okay, try it.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
I thought four would be like four or two more.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
You could do four or eight.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
So as long as it's two, as a factor of two, I'm okay.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
I mean, you want to start at the end of a measure, right?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Okay, because it just seems, okay, let's try it.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Let me try it.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Okay, you ready?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Okay, here we go.

08:01.000 --> 08:09.000
Eight, one, two, three, four, five, six.

08:09.000 --> 08:15.000
When the morning sun comes up, I go to school.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
See?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
No, see?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
You hear that?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
No, did you hear it?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Did you hear it?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Like, it didn't like a little resolvey thing.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
No, no, no, you were right in it.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
You were right in it.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
No, but it was, I said, go to school.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
And it was like, like it was like, you're done.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Like, you're done with that thought.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Okay, then let it go, let it turn it all the way around there.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
It's four?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Okay, let's hear it.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
For four?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Okay.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
Okay, yeah, you can fill that time with some music.

08:44.000 --> 08:57.000
When I go to school, I like to learn.

08:57.000 --> 09:06.000
But think about the things you should not burn.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Okay, let's do it again.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
How about this?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
How about this?

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
When it starts, just start.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Let's try that, but I'm not always going to be able to do that.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Even if it's just see if that works.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Even if it's bullshit.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Like, you're like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
All right, I'll just jump in.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I'm never going to, you know, okay.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Okay, so go ahead, try it.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
The question, do you want a topic?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
No, this is about joy.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
This song makes me happy.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I just sing from my heart.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Kevin MacLeod, if you're out there, come to Harmontown and visit the show

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
because he's really become a celebrity.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
I think we all agree that this is the greatest song of all time.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
So now, the thing is, as soon as this kicks in, just dive in.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I can even try to count you in.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
A one, two, a three, a four.

09:54.000 --> 10:10.000
With the summer, spring, and seasons of fall, I can go a whole year without lovin' it all.

10:10.000 --> 10:21.000
Spiders inside of me, leprechauns on the right of me, scary things all around, running through the cemetery.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
Oh boy, it's very scary. I've got to get to ground round.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
It's a restaurant in the Midwest.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
Family, you pay what you weigh.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Ground round.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Pay what you weigh.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
It's a mean thing to do to affect you today.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Commentary on the ground round threw me off meter.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I have big fat John.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I'm MC John's brother.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
I'm anxious about my weight, and I'm not as good a rapper.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
Thank you.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
When you go down to the house, you bring a key.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Beep, beep, toot, toot.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Bring a key to your house and you get your loot.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
I want to go inside for you.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Beep, beep, beep, toot, toot, toot.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Family, you are all of me.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Beep, beep, toot, toot.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Bring a key to your house and you get your loot.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
What is our show?

11:27.000 --> 11:33.000
What are we doing?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Okay, you're right.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
If you were a new viewer, you would be upset.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
One thing for certain, that was certainly about joy.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
I have some questions about big fat John, MC John's brother.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Why are they both named John?

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
I think that his parents were like...

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Are they full siblings or stepbrothers?

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
I think that Big Fat John, I think they're full on genetic siblings,

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
but their parents are just so mean.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Big Fat John got born and they're like, let's try again.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Oh, so MC John's the younger brother?

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Yeah, and Big Fat John is like first and then they were just like laid him aside

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
and they said, you're going to watch us do this right.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Wait.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
The parents made...

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
How old was MC John when they made him watch the parents have sex again?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Five.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
So he's five years old.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
The parents say, watch us fuck.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
We're going to build a new John.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
A good one, an MC.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
They didn't know he was going to be fat.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
No, Big Fat John's watching.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
They're building MC John.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Did they hope that he would be an MC or is that just an accident?

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Yeah, I think they wanted to make an MC.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Or a lawn keeper.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
You can make that change.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
They wanted him to be a...

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Maybe it's a family of gardeners.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
So then the irony is that Big Fat John was like, you're too fat to garden.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
We're going to make a great John.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Then they made a John that was a good MC,

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
but who is like, he toes the family line.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Like he's like, I like to mow the lawn, but really he's an MC.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I don't know.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Is that too complicated?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Is Big Fat John at heart a better gardener than MC John?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Maybe our heart goes out to Big Fat John.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
He's the dinklage of this Game of Thrones.

13:18.000 --> 13:26.000
We all know what it feels like to be a misfit and not loved.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
I mean, I admire his courage to even step into the rapping milieu.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Well, I think he was thrust into it.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I think that was actually a really awkward situation.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Someone mistook him for his brother and shoved him in and he was like,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I'm Big Fat John, I don't rap.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I think that was sad.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Is he much fatter?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Is he so fat?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
No, he's a regular size.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
It's just a horrible world with a bad body image.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Like a regular sized person with a normal metabolism.

13:53.000 --> 14:01.000
He just has grown up in a world of Cindy Crawford billboards dating myself.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Whoever your Cindy Crawford is, hologram Crawford.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
This new generation.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Cindy Meat.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
It's probably a porpoise, fucking weirdos.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Have you got a new porn fetish?

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
It used to be like...

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah, I got married and then I was just like,

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
I'm going to scratch some new itches.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
I don't mean like, is it still stockings and nipples, rubbings and things like that?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Mannequins and nipple rubbings.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
First of all, everyone likes their nipples rubbed.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
I don't like my nipples rubbed.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Rub them right.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Why don't you come over and rub my nipples?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I don't want to rub your nipples.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
One time I was wearing some socks that were like sheer.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And I showed you them and you touched them and you were like,

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Whoa!

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Because you were like, what am I doing?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
This is my thing.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
I like to rub stockings.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Oh, you were wearing socks that were like kind of nylon-y.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
And you were like, whoa, what the hell?

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Yeah, that's a tricky one.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
I get mad when people wear things and I'm like,

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
oh, that's my fetish, but you're not my wife.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
And also, you work in a bank.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
So what's the look?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
What's the what?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
What's the look? What's the outfit?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I don't know.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
It could be anything.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
What do you mean? What's the look?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
You said that you see somebody wearing something.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
No, I'm saying I see a little bit of leg with any kind of nylon on it.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I'm not saying like I see a outfit.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I'm saying like the fetish is for...

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
It's simply legs and nylons.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Yeah.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
I feel like we've been over it and I feel like we're not making,

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
you know, we're not making progress,

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
but we're talking about this.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I feel like we're near a break through right now.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
No.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
It's just a thing.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Everybody's got buttons, right?

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
You guys have buttons, little sexual buttons.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
You know who I envy?

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
These people who get turned down by bare legs, high heels, big tits,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
and like a can of beer.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Because it's clearly their planet.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
You're like driving down the street and it's like,

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
hey, big bank theory is on five nights a week

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
and it's like some ironic thing of like a woman going,

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
ooh, big bank theory and there's a can of beer between her tits.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I don't know why I'm throwing big bank theory under the bus.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
I just mean like any product that would be like,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
like where the joke is that it's supposed to be sexual,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
but like I look at it and I go, well, that's not sexual.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
That's like a parody of sexuality,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
but there are some people in the world who are like,

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
funny joke, plus I'm jerking off.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Because I also, you know, there's a lot of stuff that I'm like,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
like I'm sure people, like I've said on the podcast,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
like there's people would,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
if they were walking past it on the street,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
they'd be like, that's nothing.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
That's a fire hydrant.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
And I'd be like, that's my jam.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I was telling you backstage that I was at a party last night

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
that was very pansexual.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It was kind of all over the shop and there was a,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
there's people that were trans and also like,

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I don't know the words.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
I will get them all wrong.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I don't know all the names for things that people are

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
or don't want to be called or whatever.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
But a friend of mine who is gay,

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
but he is a man, but he's into other men,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
but he wants, he likes to date straight men

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
because he wants men.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Those are colored people.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
You said you don't know the phrases.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
That's colored people.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Colored people?

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Did they change that?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Are you my grandma?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
My grandma, look at the one,

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
she was the nicest lady in the world,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
but she looked at the one that was colored people.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
My grandparents too, but they were taught,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
that was their African-American.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
And we've kind of, we, you know, we always do that.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Like we, in the 90s,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
like the African-American thing was trotted out.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
It was never, it was never retracted,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
but like I think there might be a,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
I don't even, for all I know it's now,

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
I haven't even checked in on this, and how would you?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Remember when Kramer was apologizing

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
for his little meltdown on Letterman,

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
and he called black people Afro-Americans?

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Like, and it was like this really weird striking thing.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
I mean like what, well colored people was introduced,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
it was supposed to be like, you know,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
it was like a, it was supposed to be a healthy thing.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
The National Association for whatever the blah blah blah

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
colored people has colored people right in their name.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Advancement, advancement, I know what it is.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
I mean, it's like, it was a fine thing.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
And then we're like, oh, grandma,

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
but she's like saying it, she's trying to do it right.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
She's like, oh, there's a color gentleman.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Like, I remember, yeah, it's funny,

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
our grandma's generation.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
So my friend says, he goes like,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
I want men to treat me like a lady.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
But he's not a woman, he's a guy,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
but he wants, he likes straight men.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
I'm like, wait, so what?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Your last boyfriend was a straight guy?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
He goes, yeah.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
He goes, my last boyfriend was straight.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And I go, did you guys fuck?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
He goes, yeah, all the time.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
And I was like, wait, how does that work?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
And he goes, he goes, ain't no fag

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
going to fuck me like that.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I'm like, that's fucking fascinating.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
And so he prefers straight dick to gay dick,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
but it seems like it's pretty gay dick too.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Fucking god.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
A lot of us say, as with the,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
I think that's the Heisenberg principle.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
If you can observe a straight dick in a gay

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
butt or mouth, the moment you have

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
observed it as straight, it becomes gay.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
But that's straight talk.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
That's heteronormative psychology.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
He should know better.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
He's the expert when he's being fucked

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
by a straight guy and when he's being

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
fucked by a gay guy.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
The customer's always right, man.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
It's up to him what he wants to call

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
his customers, yeah.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
But I mean, that's the thing like,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
what was I going to say?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Probably something inflammatory and dated

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
and clumsy.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Were you still talking about color people?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
No, no, I wasn't going to talk about

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
color people.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Color people, they're on their own.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
The world's become too complicated.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Color people, you're on your own.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
The, what was it about sexuality?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I'm trying to remember.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
I was thinking of something when

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
you were talking about that.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I just like the fact that, you know,

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
as we grew up, I think we've talked

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
about this a bit.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
And of course, very poorly educated

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
conversations about it is that,

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
we grew up, like it was this, that,

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
or the other.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
There was only kind of three or four

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
crayolas in that box.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Now there's a bunch, which is great.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
But I just don't know, like I don't

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
really have the vocabulary for it.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Also, there was this switch, which I

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
totally understand, but it was a

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
definite switch from our generation

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
to this new generation, which is that

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
now you're supposed to, you're supposed

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
to ask a little bit, which in our day

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
because there was only so many things

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
and being different just got you beat

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
up.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
And I kind of tried to broach this

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
with, when Curtis was here, we were

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
talking about Revenge of the Nerds,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
which he totally, you know, like,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
you watch that movie, and it's like,

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
yeah, politically correct, through

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
the politically correct lens, there's

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
a, that movie now commits more crimes

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
than it ever solved.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
But, but, but the, but the interesting

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
thing about when you watch that movie

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
is that you can, if you want to

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
understand like the Gen X, like,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
concept of political correctness and

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
progress, all we, all we ever understood

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
was going from bullying, going from

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
bigotry to dropping that.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
And so when you watch like these 80s

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
movies where like underdogs are the

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
new heroes, what you're seeing is a

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
lot of, for lack of a better word,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
ignorance, like, like ignoring what

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
makes people different.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
So like, you see like, just unlikely

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
families and one of them's gay and one

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
of them, but they don't make gay jokes.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
They don't beat him up for being gay,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
so he's one of the family.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
And then this guy smokes pot and they

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
don't, they don't, they smoke pot with

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
him and it's just like, it's, they're

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
all put in this big pot.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
And that's the Gen X version of

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
progress, is that we stop, we stop

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
hurting each other.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
And, and so if you, and that's when I

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
ran into trouble, you know, recently

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
or a couple, couple months ago, six

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
months ago now, it was when my friend

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
Jane was up, who's, who's, who's

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Earthshined, you said you brought to

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
that party and it was a big hit.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Jane should know that.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I have to, Jane's not here, I don't

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
imagine, but I have to get, Jane, if

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
you're listening, I have to get in

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
touch with you because I brought

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
your, your absence to a party and it

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
was everybody's favorite thing and

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
I'm being tweeted about it a lot because

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
everybody got stoned to the tits on

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
the fucking absence.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
It was very good.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
I was drunk and I used the wrong

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
pronoun a thousand times with her

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
because I, he's present, she was

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
presenting very male and I was just,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I was just drunk and whatever.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
But, and then someone complained on

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Twitter and then I did not ingratiate

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
myself to the community with my

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
response, which was like, if that's

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
what you took away from their podcast,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
you are too sensitive or whatever,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
they're like, ah!

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
But, but, but the interesting take

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
away that I took from, from all of

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
that was like, you know, there's,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
if you use that as a yardstick, like

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
way out there, this like crazy new

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
world, the word crazy offensive now,

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
but, but in reference to some of the

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
stuff, but, but, but like, you're

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
actually supposed to now explore and

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
ask, which was like, kind of like,

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
goes back to like, 60's and 70's

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
kind of, like when we were at a high

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
of our like, Norman Lear kind of

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
driven like, let's end racism, but

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
then like, the 80's, 90's and things

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
kind of ushered in this world of like,

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
you know what, put your hands in your

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
pockets, look at the ground, and as

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
long as you're not hurting anybody,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
you're, you're, you're actually like

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
for progress, and it's like, the way

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I put it was like, when I was a kid on

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
the playground, anybody that like,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
asked you if you're a boy or a girl,

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
or what you preferred to be, that was

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
called a bully, it was like, I was

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
asked that a lot, I was asked if I was

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
straight or gay, I was asked if I was

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
a boy or a girl, I was asked why I don't

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
shower, I was asked, I was asked all

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
kinds of questions, and they were not,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
they were not fun questions to be asked

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
and I was, I was not happy to be asked

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
them, and the answers were not going to

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
make anyone happy, and there were, no one

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
was seeking any actual answers, and so

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
there's a kind of a psychology there

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
where you go, I, I'm going to be a hip

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
modern person when I grow up, and I'm

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
going to like, I'm not going to, I'm

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
going to go with the flow, and then now

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
we're entering this new world, we're going

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
with the flow all of a sudden, now we're

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
the, we can end up being the, the tide

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
of, of bigotry, but I'm going with the flow.

24:21.000 --> 24:35.000
Ha, fart corner, when you want the fart corner to start on the second bar,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
what's his name, Richard Jenkins, who made that

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
song? Academy Award winner, Kevin McLeod.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Kevin McLeod, there can be only two,

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
make another version of that song with

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
a little bar, a little, give me a little

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
ramp, Kevin, and if your head comes away from

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
your neck, it's over, where's the camera?

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Where's the camera when that red light

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
goes off, and then there's no red light

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
anywhere? It goes to another camera behind you.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Oh, there's a camera behind us? No, if you're

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
looking there, the red light will go on

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
somewhere else, see it's an ounce over there.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Now it's up there.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Now it's going to be over there.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
Holy ground, Highlander.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
All right.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
Oh, oh, oh, McLeod's, the Highlander's name.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah, McLeod is Highlander's name.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Thanks for backing me up, guys.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
All right, so, yeah, Netflix seems popular.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
That was my, one thing I wrote on my notepad.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
We sang some songs. We talked about race

25:37.000 --> 25:43.000
and sexual preference again.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
We finally solved it, I think.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I think we did.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
It was International Women's Day today?

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Was that today?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Yeah, and as someone wrote, the only day in the year

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
that has 23 hours in it.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Seems kind of fucked up.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I tweeted a bit like that that I thought

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
deserved more response, because I combined

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
it with that blackout day that just happened,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
which I don't even know or understand,

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
but I also looked enough to see that I'm not,

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
that me trying to understand it is like not the point.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
And so I tweeted this morning, Jeff, you'll like this.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
International Women's Day, right after blackout day?

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
Wait, no, what are they?

26:29.000 --> 26:35.000
I grant your blackout day on International Women's Day,

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
and I remind you that white men control the length of days.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I don't remember what I tweeted.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Dan, can I go back a little bit?

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Because I wrote a note down while you were doing

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
your earlier rap of the family song.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Did I hear you correctly?

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Did you say spiders and sodomy?

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
No, but I wish I had.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
What was it?

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Spiders and sodomy, or spiders to the right of me?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Oh, spiders to the right of me, yeah.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I thought for sure you said spiders and sodomy.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Spiders to the left of me, leprechauns to the right,

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
I think, or something like that.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
God damn it, I wish that song began in a way

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
that let me really lean into it.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I think that you can really start,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
you can declare the one for yourself,

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
wherever you like it.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Distracts me, this song is like resolving things,

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
and then I'm on a different path.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Should we try a new song?

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I don't think it was good, though.

27:29.000 --> 27:37.000
What about the...

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
Yeah, so you don't seem very happy about that.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I'm going to play a couple others just to remind you

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
how much you like the disco song by Kevin Macleod.

27:45.000 --> 27:51.000
See if anything, it's like holding the...

27:51.000 --> 28:00.000
It's like eating liver.

28:00.000 --> 28:06.000
Yeah, yeah.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Winter, summer, spring, fall,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
front your mama till she was three feet tall,

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
a banger on the head with my dick,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
like my dick was a hammer and she got sick.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
Now she's in the bathroom and she's throwing up,

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
so I feel bad and I bought her a puppy.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Took it to the vet, they said,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
you can't get it neutered yet,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
you gotta take it home and put it in a crate

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
and let it outside when it pees,

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
that's great, so it knows to pee outside.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
I fucked your mama so hard, she's now three feet wide.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
She's three feet tall, three feet wide,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
your mama's a spear.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I can't keep her inside, I gotta put her on the lawn

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
and play with her.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Your mama's Raymond Burr.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
She's an actor from the 80s.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
I fucked all the ladies, like 80s icons,

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
you will see a glass of my pee.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Well, oh wait, is that a new character?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
The lazy rapper?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Oh, a glass of my pee,

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
I don't know, put some pee in some poo

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
and fucked your mama like she was a shoe.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Snoop Dogg kinda phones it in,

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
so why don't I fuck your mama in a bin?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
A mama bin.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
I went to the store where they sell them in,

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
I bought two mama bins and took your mama home

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
and I fucked it with my friend and my cousin Jerome.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
The same person.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
I'm very close with my family.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I'm a lazy, lazy rapper.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
I fucked your mama in the crapper.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
I fucked your mama like my name was...

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Uh...

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
This is a lazy rapper.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
I think I'm lazy, this guy.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
He just made up...

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Six measures, wait, I'm trying to think of...

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
So lazy.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
This better pay off.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
I can't rhyme crapper with crapper.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Where's that guy going?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
I'm not working the crowd,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I'm just fucking here.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
I'm not working the crowd, I'm just fucking here mama

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
because the bitch is too loud.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
That's my cure for snoring.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Fuck your mama so hot you can't be ignoring.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
I'm a lazy rapper and I'm putting no effort in.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Fuck your mama in a bin.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Alright.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
He's a lazy, lazy rapper.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Thanks guys, thanks.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I feel like the only difference between lazy rapper

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
and your normal rapping is that it's just less loud.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Yeah, yeah, no, it's a style choice.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
It's the same quality of rap.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
They all have different styles, like Fitty said...

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
And then Snoop Dogg.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I need to hear you do some 50 cents for us.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Well it's gotta be kind of a...

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Okay, give me some Fitty.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
Well, okay, I'll try, but...

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
A 50 cent that I'm here to say

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
I cost 50 cents all the year every day

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
And I fucked your mama here and there

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
But he's faster, I mean, what am I doing?

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
But I'm just saying he has a cadence, he has a style

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
and then Snoop Dogg's like, don't...

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
And then he...

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
Because I'm a Snoop Dogg and I went to school

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
and I put my mama through and I got a...

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
Yow, yow, baby bo, baby do, gotta

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
put your mama in a boot and a shoe

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
I'm a Snoop Dogg, a Snoop Dogg rapper

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
50 cents is no rapper

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
I'm a Snoop Dogg and I'm now Snoop Dogg

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Ghostface killer!

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
No, I'm kidding.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I don't know.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
You have a gift.

31:57.000 --> 32:02.000
I'm the rich little of 90s rappers

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
but except for 50 cents who probably shoot me for saying that

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
What is it, his name is 50 cents

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
because they pulled 50 cents worth of metal out of him

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
when he got shot, was that the idea?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
That's why he got the name 50 cent.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Don't ask our crowd.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I thought that was it.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
I remember looking that up.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
He got shot and survived and they pulled enough metal out of him

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
to make 50 cents, something like that.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
I don't think I'm getting it right, but it's close to that.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Black people don't have it easy

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
and cops are bad.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Alright, moving on.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
But there are some cool cops.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
We've already talked about that.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Obviously there's some cool everything.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
If all cops were evil, we would have figured it out by now.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
For instance, if we all of a sudden had the internet

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
all of a sudden you'd be seeing all these videos with the murdering people.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
It would just start happening like that overnight.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
It has.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
But I think I've met cool cops.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
Have you ever met a cop and hang out and just hung out?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Like an off-duty cop?

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
When I was in college, I was a journalism student

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
and I did an interview with a cop to tell you about this.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
You had to write something about the police force.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
I met a cop back in Whittier that I hated because he was an asshole.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
He was the chief of police back in Whittier

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
and they had this program of harassing the homeless people.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
I sat him down, we had lunch, I took him to a Mexican restaurant

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
and I'm 18 years old, 19 years old, and we sat down and had lunch.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
He's like, look, I don't like you, you don't like me.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
He gave me the kind of like, you can't handle the truth,

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
a few good men's speech, you need people like me on that wall.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
By the end of the lunch, I actually liked him.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
He was a human being at the end of that lunch

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
but I hate the way he operates.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
He was a human being after it

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
but I still think that he was teaching his younger officers

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
to come and treat homeless people automatically with disrespect

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
and automatically as less than human.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Yeah.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
It's like there's two kinds of people in this world,

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
there's the kinds of people that think there's two kinds of people in this world

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
and then there's the good people.

34:21.000 --> 34:29.000
And that's sort of what we call right wing and left wing in America.

34:29.000 --> 34:35.000
And there's this appealing thing about the idea that there's rules

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
and that there is no chaos and that there's never an exception

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
because that's how you do get shit done as you wake up in the morning

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
and decide that you deserve something or that something needs to get done

34:45.000 --> 34:50.000
and all that stuff and if you did plunge yourself exclusively

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
into what we would call the general left kind of psyche,

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
would you get shit done or would you, I don't know,

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
are those the competing parts of our species,

35:03.000 --> 35:09.000
this idea that on one hand, everything's crazy.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
Oh, wow, fuck, you never know anything.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
And then, I don't know, is it these brush cut guys that we loathe

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
and that make us do these rituals

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
and that they're constantly embarrassing themselves

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
and getting us all into trouble and serving as an example to us

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
is like, God, you can't think like that.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
It's a vicious cycle because I got pulled over a couple weeks ago.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
I just landed at LAX, was pulling out of this parking lot I always park at,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
ran a stop sign, was right by the police station there

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
and it's like, I just kind of drifted through a stop sign

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
and I got pulled over but the guy came to my window.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I could see him through my side view mirror.

35:43.000 --> 35:48.000
He was like a very young guy and I really feel like he was probably a very new rookie.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
He came at me like I had just robbed the president's bank

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
and kicked his mom in the wallet.

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
He was like handling his gun and freaking out and it freaked me out

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
and it's like, I think that's the wrong way to approach anybody.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Why does it keep running out of here? Is he alright?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Is it the same guy?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Yeah, twice he's gone.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Well, we'll ask him when he gets back, I'm sure he'll enjoy that.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
Is he an old-timey reporter? He has to keep going to a phone booth outside?

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Stop the presses!

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Harmon calls Yahoo! Ridiculous!

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
So this cop kept, it's like, you know, I want to get home, he's dropping his pen, he's super nervous.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Alright, what's going on?

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Sir, what's your name?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Nate.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Are you okay? Is everything good?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Yeah, I'm really thirsty.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Because you just returned with an A&W...

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Jesus, sorry.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Everything's falling to shit.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
You just returned with a giant two-liter bottle of water?

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Yeah.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Did you go fill it up in the bathroom or what?

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
The water thing, the boss is the sink.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
The sink, yeah.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Can we talk to you for a second and you just hold the mic?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Yeah, yeah.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Okay.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
I like your shirt. Will you come and sit up here with the camera so I can see your shirt?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Because the guy's got his shirt so it's cooking for Jesus.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Alright, sit anywhere you like, there you go.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
Bring a giant water bottle up there too, because you're a very thirsty fellow.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
Are you so into hydration that this is a thing or is this like a...

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
That's how much water you're going to drink during our performance tonight?

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Oh no, I just get nervous and stuff.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
You get nervous?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Yeah.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
And when you get nervous, you sprint off.

37:25.000 --> 37:32.000
But you ran twice, so the first time was to pee and the second time was to fill up with more pre-pee?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Yeah.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
Are you...

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
You don't feel attacked right now, right?

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
No.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
You don't feel safe?

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Okay, good.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I'm not making a joke when I say that.

37:43.000 --> 37:49.000
You're not a freak, we just want to know what you're a journey for us.

37:49.000 --> 37:56.000
Now this diet, A&W root beer bottle, has you drunk that root beer at some point today too?

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Or is this your water bottle?

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
No, it's just my water bottle.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
That's when you carry around?

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Yeah.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
At all times?

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Well, I mean, I get a different one sometimes.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Are you on a...

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
Is it a kick that you're on right now, like a diet where you have to drink a lot of water?

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
No, I don't know.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Is this something you've always done?

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
No, I...

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
It's 80% of the earth, you're the good guy.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
We should all drink more water.

38:20.000 --> 38:27.000
I got sick, and then I got really paranoid that if I didn't drink water, I'd get a sore throat.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
How much water do you think you drink a day?

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
80 to 100 liters a day?

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
No, not 100 liters.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
What are they saying?

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
80 to 100 liters of water a day.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
What's your name?

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Nate.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Nate.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
How much water are you getting through a day, do you think?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Maybe like four of these?

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
I feel like you're asking the wrong questions.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Is it because he's not...

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
You're being invasive, aren't you?

38:55.000 --> 39:02.000
You know that it's weird to drink this much water with this much urgency, and you're not just telling us what we need to know.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Are you diabetic?

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
No, no.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
You got a cold, and now you have a little...

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
So that's it just to stave off a feeling that you're going to get sick?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Yeah, it's like a...

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah, I don't know.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Yeah.

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
Someone just sung placebo.

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
No, I mean, that's the greatest addiction to have is to run off and drink water.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
God, I wish.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Does it sink here that you're just filling up?

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I wouldn't drink out of the LA tap water.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
Oh, yeah, I mean...

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
Oh.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Someone said that's how you got used to it.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I always wonder about that, too.

39:39.000 --> 39:44.000
So, okay, so Nate, any advice out there for people out there that want to drink more water?

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
I...

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I'm a bad interviewer.

39:49.000 --> 39:55.000
You make Arsenio Hall look like Mike Wallace.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Well, I guess...

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
Thank you for bravely coming up and giving us more answers.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
Nate, if at any moment, Nate, you have to get up and run out and go pee, we're not going to make a deal out of it.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Wait, what did you just say, Nate? Did you ask a question?

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Oh, can we just talk about, like, the mother water?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Oh, something other than water?

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
Well, we have another guest here to do that.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
So far, all you are is...

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
So far, all you are is the water guy.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
What's on your mind, Nate?

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
You can't just drink so much water that we get your opinions about Obama.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
That's not fair.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
That's what Donald Trump tries to do.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
Build a bunch of buildings and then I'll have opinions.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Wait, that was 50 cents.

40:36.000 --> 40:42.000
The emperor has no clothes?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
He's so thirsty.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
God, I really think you go to the doctor and just say,

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
Dan Harmon said to ask, am I diabetic?

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
Are you diagnosing him as diabetic?

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
No, I'm telling his doctor to.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
Are diabetics notoriously thirsty?

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Yes, that's one of the big symptoms.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
If you're not diagnosed yet, that's the first thing that happens.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
It's like, fuck, I'm so thirsty.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
And then you go in and they're like, yeah, motherfucker.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Goodbye, ice cream.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
Who else besides me right now is getting thirsty just having this conversation?

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Everybody wants a drink.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
Pass your bottle around.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Nate, what's on your mind real quick?

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Is there anything pressing on your mind?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
What would you talk to us about if you...

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
If you got the conch for a while, what would you lay down on us?

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Okay, I don't know.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
This is kind of like a question my friend had.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
Like, so he said like...

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
This is a good start.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
It's a good start.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Your friend said...

41:46.000 --> 41:51.000
He said like, he was reading the mythology guy, the...

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Joseph Campbell.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Yes, yes.

41:53.000 --> 41:59.000
And he said like, a lot of religions say that you're guilty, right?

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
But that feels better than a feeling of like,

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
you have no say in what happens in the universe.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
So like, what do you think is tougher as a feeling?

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
Well, I mean, I think that...

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I think that what you named it already,

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
what's tougher is the idea that you don't have a choice in anything.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I mean, we can't handle that.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
We don't perceive the world that way.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
We make choices in real time.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
We think of them as choices.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
That's really the introduction of philosophy that suggests the idea,

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
the technical concept that we technically don't choose anything.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
And the irony is that probably that's true.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
I mean, it almost obviously is because there's what the hell is choice?

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
I mean, that debate will drive you crazy because if you...

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
If all of the circumstances are the same,

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
then that would be like saying that I flip a coin somewhere in my brain,

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
like on some primal level, and that would be something that we didn't want

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
because we want to think of ourselves as being creatures of some substance

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
and not just a bunch of dice.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
So we believe in choice.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
We experience life as choice.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I think choice is something we made up.

43:10.000 --> 43:17.000
We also made up the idea of any kind of organization to everything

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
because what is it?

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
We're living in a very, very slowed down giant explosion.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
James had three sips of water during that.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
I'm making him very nervous.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Is it a nervous response?

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
It's got to be something that has to be related to a nervous response there.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
You're not that thirsty.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Is it possible?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I'm really not that thirsty.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Is that like Lannis' blanket for you?

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
Yeah, it's like a tick almost.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
I got that.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
We all have our own ticks.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
That's a very healthy one to have, by the way.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Yeah.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Mine is PCP.

43:49.000 --> 43:54.000
I strangle a prostitute.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
I have to touch the light switch three times before I leave the house

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
and then I'm like...

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
You're just like the others.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Okay, now I can edit.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Nate, everybody, thank you, Nate.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Thank you, Nate.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Thank you, Nate.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Always a...

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
Harmontown's thirstiest fan.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
I always appreciate it when people come up here

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
and they subject themselves to the scrutiny of the spotlight.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
We were just worried because you darted out here like something...

44:21.000 --> 44:26.000
Oh, I was trying to make it like not awkward, you know?

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
Mission Unaccomplished.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
From now on, Nate, just walk at any pace you like.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
You can sprint out, you can jog out, you can walk out, you can crawl out.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
We're not going to make a deal out of it.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I mean, look at Anatoli next to you.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
This fucking guy...

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Don't move.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I'm taking a picture of this.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
This is like the height of balls.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Is that Garcia Lorca on your shirt?

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Who is that?

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
No, it's Anton Chekhov.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Anton Chekhov?

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
All right.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
He had the greatest death of all time.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
How do you die?

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
As far as I know, do you know the circumstances of his death, Anatoli?

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
No.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
As far as I read that he was quite an old man,

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
like I think it's in his 80 or so,

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
and he was on his, like, on his, you know, plantation or whatever,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
like his estate, and he and his old wife,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
he'd been with forever.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
They had a family over and he would walk out in the garden

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
and he would just improvise stories for his grandchildren.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
And they would go like,

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
Grandpa, the light, the lamp post,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
and he would just improvise a story for them.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
So all the family goes away.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
He comes back in.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
The family goes home.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
It's just he and his old wife.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
And she says,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
let's have champagne and some strawberries or something.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
And he goes,

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I haven't had champagne in a very long time.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
I think I'll rest.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
And so she goes off to get the champagne.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
When she comes back,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
he's laying on the couch dead with a smile on his face.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
And she sits down next to him

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
and drinks the champagne and has the strawberries

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
and just like, she's like, fuck it.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
That's a great death.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
And then in his funeral,

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
I guess all these Russians turned out to go to his funeral.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
And I might have this wrong.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Somebody please fact check this.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I think it's Chekhov's death,

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
where they all go,

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Coffin's on a train car

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
and they all march behind the train car

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
in the cold rain or whatever.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
And it's a bunch of fancy pants society people

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
that all want to go more in Chekhov's death.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
They realize also it smells like crap

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
because they're following the wrong train

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
and it's got oysters on it.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
And it says it's rotting fish.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
And they'd followed for miles the wrong train

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
and they had to go all the way back

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
the other direction to follow the right train back.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
And his friends of Chekhov said,

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
it's like he wrote his own funeral

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
because that's exactly what he would have written.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
But falling asleep while your wife is off to get champagne

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
and her coming back and you have a smile on your face

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
and she finishes the champagne is groovy.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
I like that.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
You know, you hold your breath though

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
because you go like, well, okay,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
so I would come back and I would be like,

46:38.000 --> 46:43.000
ah, no, no.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
And in between like shaking the corpse,

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
I'd be like, why couldn't you have done it

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
after calling me a cunt?

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Why is that better?

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
Because what the fuck I was looking forward to

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
having champagne like the one afternoon.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
They were in their 80s.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
They're old people.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
It's going to happen.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
Stensibly they've done it before.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
No, I know I'm the bad guy,

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
but I'm saying like that's why I'm afraid.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
That's what that's fear of death

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
is the thing that makes you go, no.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Like, I want the good things.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
If you're in your 80s and let's say

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
you're 90 and Erin would be what, 80?

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
How about you?

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
She should be like 23.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
She's 23, right.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Every guy, she's a fetus right now.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
And you're in your like old people

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
and if you peacefully passed away at 90 years old

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
and she came in with a bottle of Kettle One

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
and sat down next to you

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
and you had a smile on your face,

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
it's a pleasant way to go.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
I'm going to cry thinking about that.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
That's so fucked up.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
You're 90 years old in the story.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
But it's just, that would have been

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
the first afternoon that I stopped working

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
and I would be like, oh, let's have some Kettle One.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Like, maybe once it gets boring,

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
like a good death would be like,

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
okay, let's go to Costco.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
And she's like, I'll go get the card

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
and then she comes back and I'm dead.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
And she'd be like, she'd look at my corpse

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
and look at the card and be like,

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I can go to Albertsons

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
because no bulk.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
And it's like, yeah, he nailed his death.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
We don't have to go to Costco.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
Greg Proops his joke.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
There was a big fear when they found out

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
that Jimi Hendrix had lied about being gay

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
to get out of the Vietnam War and Greg said,

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
I lied about being gay last Wednesday

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
to get out of going to Home Depot.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
All right, wait, can we, he graciously like,

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
I told him to come because there's never been

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
a more overwhelming demand for somebody to come back,

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
specifically for his performance in Shadow Run.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Curtis Armstrong came back.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Oh, shit!

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
How special.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Thank you.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Thank you.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Thank you.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
Hi!

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
Thank you.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Thank you.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
Gosh, I've never been asked back anywhere.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Usually they're so relieved.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
After the show last time, we were like,

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
you'd split and we were back in the green room

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
and Dan's like, I really want him to come back.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
I'm like, ask him.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
I don't know.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
That seems like forward.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I'm like, it's better to ask and him say no.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Like, let's just ask.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Well, like I'm gonna say no.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
But I mean, you said last week,

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
you said, you know, you have to come back.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Everybody always says you have to come back

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
and then you never hear from them again.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Oh, is that what's going on

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
on the other side of those conversations?

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
Yeah, because I always go,

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
you have to come back and then they go, yeah.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
No, no, no.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
What was happening in this case was,

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
you said to me, we have to have you back.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
And I said, great, that would be great.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
And then I walked out thinking,

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
well, he'll never come back.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
Oh, this is great.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Wow, what a great new family member.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I actually get asked back.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
No one ever does that.

49:48.000 --> 49:59.000
Now you have to come back every week for sure.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
Which you'll do until the season of King of the Nerds.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
It gets picked up.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
And then I don't have to.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
Yeah.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
And then you'll be like, fuck you nerds.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Fly away in your biplane.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
That's how I picture rich people.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Yeah.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
You're just flying in a biplane.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Yeah.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Seeing that.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
Let's also just, let's bring out a title wave of friends.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Let's bring out Spencer.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Spencer.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Spencer Crittenden.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Spencer, get your cheeks out here.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
He may have.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
Okay.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Spencer's getting high in the back or something.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
He was back there somewhere.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
He probably, but when we brought you up,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
he's probably, I probably have about 10 minutes

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
to do what needs to be done.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
And he grabbed his rubber hose and his needle.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
If I know Spencer, what time is it?

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
9.03.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
If I know Spencer, he's giving cut rate hands jobs

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
out in the parking lot.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
I do it because I like to do it.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
That's the thing.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
That's the thing about hands jobs.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I like giving them.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
But you never, you never, no one ever tells you.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Yeah.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Well, you should, you should, you should just give them.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
That's Spencer impression.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Like ran out some rocks.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
Wow.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
You're really a bad impressionist.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
I don't know. I mean, it's just learning new things

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
about your, about your coworkers.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Do you have, do you have any impression?

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
I will not make you do them, but do you,

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
do you, are you a person that has impressions in you

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
or do you not have any?

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Oh, no, no, no, I don't really,

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
I don't really have impressions.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
I'm not very good at it.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
I, as a child.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
Do you hear Dan?

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
Hey!

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
There he is.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
We're out in the parking lot.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
He's giving HJs.

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
Looks like you're, are you bringing those to flaunt?

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
You've got water in every pocket.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
Oh, yeah.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Two, you know, there's more than one guy

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
that drinks an abnormal amount of water, Dan.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Yeah.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
No, I just, I'm sorry I came on and I cut you off.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
That was very rude of me.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
It's all right.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
I actually had started a water backstage,

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
but I left it there because I was self-conscious after.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
Jesus, I don't want to be the anti-water guy.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
I figured, I, you know, you'd, you know, start in on me.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
I still, I still think...

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
Curtis.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Curtis.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I still think that guy is being dodgy.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
He's cool, man.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
I'm cool.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
He got up twice.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
This is what I don't understand.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
How thirsty can you be?

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
Within 45 seconds of my memory, I was very close together.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
So one time was to pee and one time was to get water,

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
but he's, water is part of his life.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
I don't know, I think the guy is like shady and dishonest

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
and a terrible person.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I don't think so.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
He's cooking for Jesus.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
Obviously, I'm kidding.

52:46.000 --> 52:51.000
I just, you know, we're concerned about our fans when they go running like that.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
So, so, all right, so where did we leave off?

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Moonlighting.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
My wife is not coming this week.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
She's not coming this week.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
So she doesn't get to ask me those really awkward questions

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
that I had to follow up each time

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
because I wasn't sure what she meant.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
Yeah.

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
She, she is sick.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
I don't know how much more I'm supposed to say.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
I'm sorry.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
She's pooping a lot.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
She's puking.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Sounds like diabetes.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
She thought it was food poisoning.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
By the way, my lovely wife,

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
I just listened to their first episode of their new podcast

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
that she's doing with Wayne Fetterman called Human Conversation.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
It's a, it's 55 minutes of your life.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
It's not that big a deal.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Give it a listen.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
It's like a...

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Rage Dan Harmon from the Chicago Tribune.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
It's a, it's a pleasant chat.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
I mean, I honestly, I've only listened to one episode.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
There's something kind of addictive about it.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
It's like, it sort of harkens back to a kind of like,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I don't know, morning or afternoon.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Like kind of, it's just a man and a woman.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
They're just chatting and it's kind of, it's, it's, it's funny to me.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
But then again, I'm a big fan of my wife.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
I don't know.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
But this Wayne Fetterman fellow seems very, very funny too.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
He's kind of, he's kind of like...

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
He's coaching her basketball team, if I'm not mistaken.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
And he sort of, he sort of has a kind of like,

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
old man sensibility that kind of like,

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
I don't know, like liberates you to look at the world

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
randomly or afresh.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Like he doesn't use profanity.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
He, I don't know, it's funny.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
When I think about how he must see me.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
Like, why is he, so why does he have to be angry?

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Anyways, Curtis.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Yeah.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
I know. Where do you start, right?

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
I mean, I feel like, you know, you were sort of on a roll

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
and then I came out.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
No, no, no, I wasn't.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Curtis, Curtis, you're sitting only three feet away

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
from one of the greatest, most gifted interviewers of all time.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
I know.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
Oh, yeah.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
I know. I've been here before.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
Be prepared to answer some very trenchant,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
very salient questions.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Okay, fire away, man.

54:58.000 --> 55:03.000
When did you lose your virginity?

55:03.000 --> 55:08.000
And how and why?

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
In any order.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Okay.

55:11.000 --> 55:24.000
I lost my virginity at the age of 21 or two.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
Chill?

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
She's here?

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
Unbelievable.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
Was it Jill?

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
It's Jill. She's here.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
I lost my virginity at the age of 21 or 22

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Whoa, sounds like you're making that up.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
I'm not.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
So you had a gal in Kalamazoo.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
And she took pity on me where none had before.

55:56.000 --> 56:03.000
And she deprived me of my virginity.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
But only once.

56:05.000 --> 56:10.000
Is this still the same Curtis that was playing a tableau violin?

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
No, this is a slightly later Curtis, just by a couple of years.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
What was your bag at age 21, 22?

56:17.000 --> 56:23.000
I did English accents because I thought it might make me more attractive.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
So I would learn to do English accents.

56:27.000 --> 56:33.000
And in fact, I remember Jill telling me that the reason she actually slept with me

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
was because of my English accent.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
So it worked.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
How did she encounter it?

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Well, because I would do it.

56:43.000 --> 56:47.000
But I mean like, well, so you were working the front window and you're like,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
would you like whole fries with that governor?

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
No, no, no.

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
It was a more, it wasn't like a governor one.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
It was more of a...

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Could you do it by region?

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
You say accents, like could you do region?

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
Yeah, I would do, well, I mean, I would do my idea of regions.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
But it would really would be like a bad cockney.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
And then there would be, it would be Nigel Bruce.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
It would be a cockney or, you know, extraordinary homes.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
That sort of thing.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
That's a very good Nigel Bruce, by the way.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
You can do impressions. That's very good.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
That was one, yeah. I did do that one.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I used to do them when I was a child.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
I think Nigel Bruce is too blustery as a...

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
I agree with you. He is as Watson, yes.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
He's too blustery, but I loved him.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
Yeah, he's great.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
He's not Watson, but I loved him.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
And I found I could do him.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
Now, doing Nigel Bruce doesn't get you laid.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
You would have to do it.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Unless you're doing Nigel Bruce.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
Unless you're...

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
Who only has sex with straight men?

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
It's a callback.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
My favorite part of that fad of a joke

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
was watching the lights in the camera

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
trying to find where the comedy was.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
The director was like,

58:06.000 --> 58:10.000
something funny has to be going on right now.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Hold it.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Do I take it that this young lady

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
and you were part of the same theatrical community?

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
Yes, we were, in school, you know, in college.

58:19.000 --> 58:24.000
And I had done a part in a play that somebody had written,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
and I did it with an English accent,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
not because it was required,

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
because I thought it would be a good chance

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
to show off my English accent, and it worked.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
All right, well, we're getting to know you,

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
and I'm trying to play it cool, but it's 9-11.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
And we're trying to establish a tradition here at 9-11.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
What was it about?

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Oh, my God!

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
What do we do? We make a...

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
Oh, it was the 9-11 thing from last week.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
Did we just sing the 9-11 song?

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
Hit it!

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
No, that's probably going to be offensive.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
That's going to end up offensive.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Oh, not if it's sultry, though.

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
Why'd you have to bring those towers down?

59:14.000 --> 59:21.000
Why'd you have to bring my country up frown?

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
We're just trying to be free.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
Why you gotta attack me?

59:27.000 --> 59:32.000
Let your terrorist body down to the brink of dawn.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
Yo, Elkada, why you gotta be like that?

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Ain't no fighting.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Ain't it gotta be a spat?

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
Yo, Elkada, in Afghanistan,

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
ain't trying to do it in Iraq and Iran.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
You gotta...

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
I'm just trying to be cool in New York.

59:47.000 --> 59:52.000
I gotta look up to the sky and see fallin' pork.

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
What I thought, but I found out it was...

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
It's fucked up.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
I'm gonna cry.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I'm traumatized.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I saw a guy who told me it was P to the TSD.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I thought, shouldn't get that in the city, you see?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I'm just a deli worker and a rapper on the side

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
trying to lay it low and open up wide

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
and live my life and pay my revenues.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Fuck you, Elkada.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Why you choose to attack us?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Cause you're gonna pay no freedom.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Why you hate away your life?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
You gotta attack or no?

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Two towers and two states of mind.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
When you look beyond it, you'll find that

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
everybody just wants to get down,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
got a tower on the left and now it's down.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Why the fuck you do that?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Now, everybody's changed and language is changing

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
like a...

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Oh, shit, I can't rap anymore.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I'm all broken up because of 9-Eleven.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Okay.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Jesus.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Wow.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
The final casualty of 9-Eleven is your ability to rap.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I blamed it on 9-Eleven.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Do you want to drink, Curtis?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I might have one in a minute.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I'm okay right now, I'll take that.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Otherwise I'm digging in your ice.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
That's all right.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Here, reminder that I've been digging the ice all night.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Okay.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
So Jill, where did it all go?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Jill?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Where did it go down with Jill?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Where did it go down with Jill?

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Where did it happen?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
In my room.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
You have an apartment, a dorm?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
A dorm, yeah.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It was just once.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Never again, one time?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
No, that was it.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I mean, since then, yes.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.000
But with Jill, it was just the one time.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Enjoyable?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Was it a good time?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
It was very quick.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
It was very quick, but yeah.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
I mean, she only needed the one.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Yes, it worked perfectly.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Yeah, once it's done, and it's done,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
and you move on with your life.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And she did, and I never found anyone

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
who was as attracted to the English accent after that.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
That was like a one time thing that worked.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Did you try the English accent?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Yeah, I still do.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Really?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Yeah.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Once I was at a bar, I had a roommate who was Irish,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
and we were at a bar pretending to do Scottish accents,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
and there was nobody at this bar.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
He was Irish, but he was pretending to do Scottish accents?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
He was from Dublin, and we were hanging out at the three of clubs,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
and there was nobody in the bar but us in the bartenders,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
and they were far down the other side of the room.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
And so, for some reason, he was talking about a friend of his,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
and he was doing a Scottish accent to tell the story,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
and so I started doing it too.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
And then these girls came up next to us in order to drink,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
and they're like, oh, where are you guys from?

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
And he's like, oh, it's from Aberdeen,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
and he could really do it, and I could kind of do it,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
and so he was nailing it, and they're like,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
oh, my God, this accent is so great.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
And then all their friends showed up, and there were more girls.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Now, the bartenders had known, they knew me,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
and they knew that we weren't Scottish earlier in that evening.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Now we're doing it because now we just don't want it.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Now it's just embarrassing to stop doing it,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
and we thought any moment these girls would get their drinks,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
go leave, sit down somewhere and leave us,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
that'll be that, and just more people came around,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
and it's like, are you from...

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I've been to Aberdeen, and he...

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Oh, now you're in trouble.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
But he's like, how far is Aberdeen from Leith?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Oh, it's about 45 minutes to go up there,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
and he knew all the fucking shit,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and so there was one girl there, her name was Mouse,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
and I had never met this girl in my life.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Is she a DJ?

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
She actually was a DJ.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
All right, well...

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Well spotted.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
But I had not met this girl in my life,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
and so...

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Was either that or her parents raised her in a basement.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Probably both.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So I kept seeing her every two weeks for the rest of time,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
for the rest of eternity, I kept running into her,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
and we had talked for a good 45 minutes

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
in this me doing this bullshit Scottish accent.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
So every time I'd see her,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
she'd walk into another bar on a different side of town,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
and I would turn to whoever was next to her,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
and go, okay, I'm Scottish.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
She's like, oh, everybody!

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Melinda, Carissa, this is Jeff,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
he's from Aberdeen from Scotland,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
and he's got the best accent.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
How'd you do? Good to see you again.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
And I would do that, and I was so tiring.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
So one day, after about a year and a half of this...

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Look, I honestly saw her a dozen times,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and I kept doing it, and I felt so bad about it,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
and I didn't want to...

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I wasn't getting anything out of this.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
She just kept... She loved that I had...

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I was from Scotland, and I was not.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
So I had enough of it, and so I went up to her,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
and she goes, hey, Jeff, how you doing?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
This is my friend Melinda, and so on and so forth.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I'm like, hey, what's going on?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
And she couldn't...

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Gives me a weird look, and I said,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
how you doing? I'm doing great, how you doing?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And she's like, where's your accent?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
You know, I'm an actor, and they tell you,

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
like as an actor, you just practice speaking

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
in an American accent as often as possible.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Just to get good at it.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And she goes, and she's still looking at me like...

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
She goes, okay, do it. Do your American accent.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I'm like, what do you want me to say?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
And she goes, I'd like a cheeseburger and fries.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I go, I'd like a cheeseburger and fries.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And she goes, it's okay.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
It's okay.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I was so...

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Like right up to the five inches before the finish line,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
that story was going to be called,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
You're an asshole.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Oh no, that's certainly the title of that story.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Because on any given day,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
like in any bar in LA, there's some fuckface

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
who's like lying to people for social profit.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
It never got me laid, it never earned me a penny.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I profited none off of doing that.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
It was just, I felt it was weirder to just say,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
oh, I was bullshitting you the whole time.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I thought I'd never see you again.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And then it turns out we went to the same free places all the time.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
It was such a weird culture shock.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Like I could barely remember being back in Wisconsin

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
where this never happened.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I remember moving from Wisconsin to LA.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
I remember going out and trying to just hang out

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
because that's what I did in Milwaukee.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Like you just went out and just drank and made friends.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And I remember small talking, some guy at some bar

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
because my friends dragged me too.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
And I was like, so what do you do?

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
And he's like, I silk screened t-shirts.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
And I was like, oh, that's interesting.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I don't know anything about silk screening t-shirts.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
How does that work?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And he's like, well, you take a thing and you do this

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
and he's describing the whole process.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And I go, so then do you mass produce them

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
and do you sell them through like a PO box or whatever?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
And he goes, I'm just fucking with you, man.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And I'm like, that's hilarious.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I'm going to go home and write a hit TV show.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Hit in quotes, hit in quotes.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
No, I just, it was like, it was a really big,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
like I prefer LA culture to Milwaukee culture.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I think there's a heavy share of dishonesty

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
in institutionalized alcoholism as well.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
We weren't good people just because,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
but we didn't have a reason to fuck with people.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
That wasn't recreation.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
It was for assholes.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
You called those people assholes.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
If you caught somebody saying something

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
to someone that wasn't true,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
that person was just an asshole.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And in LA, it's like,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
but do you see the coolest guy in the world?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
There's just more people

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
and we all came from all these different cities.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Did I tell you the story about the guy that lied to me

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
and I caught him in a lie at the drawing room?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I don't know his name, so it's not inflammatory.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I sat next to a guy and he was daytime drinking

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
at the drawing room, our little dive bar,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
and it's like a little cheers-y kind of place

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
where everyone knows everybody.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Minus the cheers.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Minus the cheers.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
More sadness and more drug addicts.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Less of a clarinet and more of like a 60-cycle hum

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
that you hear when you leave the inch jack

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
like laying in some water.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And a slight smell of methane and poop in the air.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
It's a great place.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
So this guy was sitting at the end of the bar

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
and something came up and so we're talking across the bar

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
about the song that's in the jig box or whatever.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
So we're having a conversation.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
So I just scoot down so we're not yelling.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
So I sit near him and we're having a conversation.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
What do you do?

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
He's like, I'm a writer.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I'm a filmmaker.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I live up in the Los Feliz Hills here

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
and I got a great house, married.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
It's just like life is fantastic.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I'm doing what I want.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I'm making these movies.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
No one watches them.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
They're kind of for nothing.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And I'm usually broke.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I'm mortgaging the house all the time.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
But I'm doing what I love.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I'm like, that's fantastic.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And he never once asked me what I did,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
which is a very common thing,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
having a conversation with people in Los Angeles

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
or strangers.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
He just kind of went in his monologue

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
about how awesome things were.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And so I just kept asking him questions.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Like, where'd you grow up?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I grew up here in LA.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
What did you do before filmmaking?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I'm kind of a failed actor.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I was an actor.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I did theater as a kid.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Oh, me too.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I did theater as a kid.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And he goes, yeah, I was on Broadway as a kid.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
So was I.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And I said, what show did you do on Broadway?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And he goes, OK, now he's blind because you don't remember.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
You forget the show you were on in Broadway.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
It was the thing with the guy.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
You remember the fucking show that you did on Broadway.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
So he's fishing for it.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000
And he goes, it's the one with the chits on the feathers.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Now, what he doesn't know is he's now walking towards saying

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
that he was on.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
And also, I found out he's my age.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
He's a year older than I am.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
He says that he's in.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
He goes, it's the one with the bald guy, your Brenner.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
That guy with the King and I.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
No.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Now, Curtis, I was on Broadway in 1985 in the King and I.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
So he's I go.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And at that point I go, oh, how old are you?

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Because it might have been a different production of it.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
He goes, I'm 41 or whatever he was.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I was a couple of years older than me at the time.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I'm like, OK.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
So how old were you?

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Have been at the time?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
He's like, so I guess that would have been.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
I would have been about 11, 12 years old.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
And no.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
So then your Brenner was dead at that point.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Because I was the last guy to play.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I said, what role did you play?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And he goes, I played the kid.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I go, Louie?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Yeah, I played Louie.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Because there's only one white kid and the King and I.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
The other kids are all the Siamese kids of the King.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Right.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And the Prince.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000
And so I'm like, that's such a crazy thing to say.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Also, I thought he was lying when he didn't know the name of it.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
So I'm sitting there.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
And we talked for, I would say, a solid 45 minutes an hour

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
about his life and about everything.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And I learned all this stuff.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
And now I'm just kind of reeling.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Everything he said has been bullshit.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
So I said, so that would have been in 1985?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Did you, are you sure it wasn't like a few years before?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Because, and maybe furious, like, and he goes, he goes,

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
no, no, no, I did it with your Brenner.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I played Louie in the King and I in 1985.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000
And I was like, I said, so did I.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
And he, his hair fucking went white.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
And he goes, oh, I said, I was trying to take him off the hook.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I said, look, when I was doing it, and also, by the way,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I never missed a performance.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
So like, there's not even a chance that he was an understudy.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I wondered, maybe he was one of my understudies,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
because there were seven of them.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I was like, oh, fuck, maybe he was one of those kids

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
that I don't remember from back then.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And I said, well, I did it too.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
And I said, maybe did you just audition for it?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Because you were constantly auditioning for it.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And he just picked up his shit and walked out.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Oh!

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
That's one of the, and I turned to the bar and said,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
what the fuck was that?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I said, he told the only lie I could catch him in.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000
He named, if he said he played the black kid in the whiz,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I couldn't have busted him on that.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
And if he said he was rum-tum-tugger,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I couldn't have fucking got him.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
But he said the role and the day and the thing,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
he couldn't name the theater.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
He was just full of shit.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
And a lot of those people congregate in bars and do that.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
So I turned to the bar and said, did you fucking hit him?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
And she goes, oh yeah, by the way, his wife hates his guts.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
He doesn't live at home.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Everything he said was absolute malarkey.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And so, pursuantly, since I've seen him,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I once in a while, he's come back in,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
and he'll see me, and he'll walk him right back out.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Where are we talking about that?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
There's an actual...

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Nate, everybody!

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
They want to get hydrated.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Let's use the...

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I wasn't going to say anything.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Let's use the transition to bring Jamorge out here.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Jamorge Brown, everybody!

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Curtis hasn't met Jamorge.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Right, okay.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Oh!

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Yeah, music choice seems racist.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
It was your 9-11 song, wasn't it?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
No, I'm kidding.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Can we edit together all the missed handshakes

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
and high fives that I did over here?

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Did I miss one?

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
No, no, every time people come up,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I get one of these and they just go right on by.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
But we were just...

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
That happened last week.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
It did.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
It happens, Curtis.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
People just...

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
We did this earlier.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
You hugged me.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I didn't just do this.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I hugged you.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I hugged you.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I hugged you after giving you a break.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I hugged you after giving you a break.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I hugged you after giving you a break.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
When everyone else walks by,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
you're not even there.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
You know why?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Why?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Because you're a tender soul.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Yeah, well...

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Jamorge lies with his eyes.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
And his body.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And his body.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Dear Jimmy.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I love the idea of Jamorge as a bad person.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
That is a funny idea.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:54.080
Like a little fucking evil

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.080
man.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.080
He seems impenetrable.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.720
not stop at just images of DeMorge doing something really fucked up and cruel to

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:04.640
somebody. It just seems ironic. I saw DeMorge at the grocery store and he was just like,

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:16.280
kick to this kid. I did it. But with that liar guy, like there's just a like, God damn it,

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:19.520
I swear I was just talking about this with somebody probably on this podcast, but there

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:26.840
was also like, this is a thing with alcoholism too. There's a sort of disorder where you

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:31.160
start to become a pathological liar and we band you that phrase around pathological liar

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:38.720
and we tend to mean somebody who lies a lot. But it's like, there are people who truly

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:44.360
cannot control. And not just can't tell the truth, won't tell the truth. They won't and

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:49.320
they can't and they lie and they lie and they lie. And I think there's some there's some

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:54.520
link with alcohol there where like, if your brain starts to fucking like, if you're like

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.520
committed to sitting there drinking, that's why you find like, at those troughs, they're

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:04.720
like, there's just these guys with a million stories and they, they kind of it starts to,

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.120
there's some, there's some syndrome where you start to create your own memories and

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:12.080
you stack them up and then like you're drawing on those and you don't know it's not the truth,

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.840
except that guy, I would be willing to bet in that moment when you said the reason his

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:20.640
hair turned white is because he realized in that moment he was lying, not so much because

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.440
he got caught because he realized because he was like, yeah, oh shit, there's no way

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.440
I'm telling the truth right now.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.560
I see, I can't, I don't know. I think that he knew he was bullshitting me from front

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:34.520
to back. He wasn't drunk. He didn't, he didn't strike me as a career drinker.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.840
We always think about lies as being like this thing that you use like a crowbar because

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.680
we, we, we have a conscience and we, we tend not to lie to each other because we feel guilt

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:47.920
about it. And so when we look at like sociopathic tendencies as being like, like, oh, that person's

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.180
cheating and they're using like a thing, a tool to open a thing and they can get more

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.600
shit done than we can.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:59.920
But there's a dark side to it where they can't control it. They cannot. They can't just be

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:04.960
normal. They can't feel and they, they can't be, they can't be beholden to this wonderful

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.920
thing we all share, which is this river we'd go down, which is like, there's fucking truth.

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.920
Get on it, motherfucker.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:15.600
Well, you know, there's, there's something else which occurred to me was he may have

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:21.320
been lying to you. He may also have been lying to the, to the bartender because if she was

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:26.440
really good looking, he would of course tell her that his wife doesn't love him and he

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.440
doesn't live at home.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.440
Yeah, that I don't know.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.440
That whole thing.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.520
I think she, I think she, she had said that like, it wasn't that he had unburdened that

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.840
on her is that he, she happens to either know the woman or she knows somebody else that

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.800
knows the score there. So like, like it was like kind of, I think semi verifiable that

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:43.800
that wasn't the case.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:44.800
Yeah.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.880
But that's, that's very likely. I think that he was just, I think he was creating a fantasy

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.160
world that, and in that world, everything not only is great, but also has always been

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.640
great and always has been different.

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.640
Oh yeah.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:01.320
And that has to be easy to do in that world because if you're a person who's planted at

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.280
a bar on a regular basis, to the left and to the right of you, you have people who kind

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.600
of flit in and flit out.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.600
Yeah.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.600
And they're all looking through.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.040
And you can tell pieces of that story. You can lay the game with all, you know, with

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.040
all those, with all those just people.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.040
That's why you go to a bar. That's why you don't just sit at home and drink. Like you,

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:19.680
you go to a bar, the idea is this chorus line of linear connectivity that you can choose.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:24.080
You can stare forward and drink or you can bother to connect with one person and control

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.640
it. And if that person says, I'm a trumpet player, and he's like, you start to feel like

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.760
you're getting your life done. Like you're a cooler person than sober people. Like, there's

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.960
a camera behind the bar pointing at me. I'm getting to know the trumpet player. I'm expanding

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.200
my horizons.

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:41.040
But then there's, of course, like any biosphere, there's this fungus growing on that, which

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:45.640
is like people who are just like, yeah, I'm a trumpet player. They're not. They're just

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:53.360
more alcohol than man. Weird. What if I became one of them? What if I was just like, what

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.640
if I lost my whole life to that? What if I was just sitting there going like, all right,

01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:03.440
NBC, and then I'm a spider? You're a spider? Yeah, I'm a spider. I work for NBC and I'm

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.440
a spider.

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:08.960
Tell me more. I gotta eat legs. And then the next time there's this person, you talk to

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.960
you like you got the whole spiel about the eight legs going on. And do you think it's

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.400
the truth?

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:21.280
Let's not do that. Let's just drink it home like we should. Okay. We should start playing

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:30.000
Shadowrun and we got no Aaron, so we should. Oh, yeah? Somebody has nominated himself to

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
play Mercy.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.880
Sounds like Adam Goldberg. Think about that. But don't you get him? What's your name?

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:36.880
Jen?

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:42.400
Jen? I'll leave it to the audience. Adam Goldberg or just Jen that we just met? Jen to the

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:49.600
stage, everybody. Jen. No offense, Adam. But democracy being what it is.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:58.480
Hello, Jen. Hey, Jen, how are you? Jen, anything? How's the show been going? Is this your first

01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.480
time at the show?

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:04.400
No, I've been going, I think, for the past six weeks, I think. I just moved here in the

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:09.880
fall from Arizona. So I came here with my sisters first. So they're big fans, so shout

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.880
it to them. They hate me now.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.400
Are your sisters in the back?

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.640
No, they're actually in the UK.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:23.720
Oh, okay. They're really in the back. Yeah. In the back of the Atlantic. So, God, now

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.960
I have like eight questions for you, though.

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:30.120
You came here from Arizona to do what?

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.560
I'm at LMU, where Jamal goes, throwback.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.560
Jamal, our post-racial astronaut.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:36.560
Yes, I know Jamal.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.560
Loyola Marymount.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:40.160
Yes. I'm studying film and TV production.

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:48.080
Okay. What's the big dream? If you had your super-duper pie-in-the-sky gig, what would

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.080
that be?

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.760
Right now, I really like cinematography. So, cinematographer, maybe, editor, something

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.760
like that.

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:55.760
Great.

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.560
You never know. I'm young, so...

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.560
Film, digital?

01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.560
Yeah.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.560
It wasn't a guess or no.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.560
Yeah.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:08.560
Okay, so, Kurt, you're taking this one. This is your guy again. And then the rest of you,

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.760
God damn it, I forgot our name already.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.760
Jen.

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.760
Jen.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.160
You are obviously taking Erin McGathy's folder, and Jeff is...

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.560
Are you familiar with Mercy, her character?

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.560
Yes, I am.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.560
Good for you.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.560
I hope I do justice.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.560
That's for you and Erin, part company.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:28.560
Can I ask very quickly, though, about your sisters being in the UK?

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:33.560
Yeah, they go to school there. So, my older sister, Amanda, goes to school in London.

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:34.560
Which school?

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.560
And then, my other sister, University College London.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.560
University of College London?

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.560
Yes, where it's like, there's no space, like there's no other words, University of College

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:45.560
London.

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.560
Gotcha.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.560
Right.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:48.560
She's a liar.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:49.560
Can you do an English accent?

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.560
Oh, no.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.560
No.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.560
No way.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.560
And then my other sister, who's actually my twin, she goes to school in University

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.560
of Edinburgh.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.560
Oh, really?

01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.560
Yes.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.560
And I know how you guys like that city.

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.560
Can you do a Scottish accent?

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.560
No.

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.560
I can't do it.

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:12.560
So, I have a girlfriend who taught me, there is a mnemonic device, like a children's rhyme,

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:20.560
that takes you through the whole lineage of every monarch of England, from the get-go

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:21.560
to the now-go.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.560
I've heard it, but I don't know.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.560
It's like, there's a Charlie and a Nicky and no get it boogie, but it's cute.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.560
Who could forget King Nicky?

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.560
Well, they do.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.560
They truncate him.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:38.560
It's like, Addy and Chuck and Pookie and Tuck, and kind of like Pookie, and they're like,

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:39.560
well, that's Peter.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.560
And they're like, okay.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.560
It's kind of amazing, though.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.560
It's just a weird thing to be part of it.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.560
Can you imagine being part of a country that's older than 200 years?

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:57.560
Just weird that you could go back until almost year zero with the people that are part of

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.560
it.

01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.560
Who cares?

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.560
Shut up.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.560
Can I also add one thing?

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.560
I actually, I'm channeling Aaron right now.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.560
I brought cookies.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.560
I just came back.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.560
I got back, like, two hours ago.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.560
I came back down from Mammoth.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.560
I was there this weekend.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.560
And I had the people drop me off here, so I could come.

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:18.560
What kind of cookies are they?

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:21.560
Let's get them up here.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:26.560
We have mixed results with Edibles here.

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:29.560
Who is the guy that brought those Christ-Christy ones?

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.560
Really?

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:35.560
So the person that brought those Christ-Christy treats, like, my dog ate a tin of them and

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:40.560
had to go to the emergency rich dog drug addict hospital.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.560
Because he was high as fuck.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:50.560
To recover from my dog, my dog who probably did not learn his lesson, because he eats

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:56.560
cakes off of the middle of the table, ate a tin of pot-raised Christ-Christy treats.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.560
I had one of those, and I was fucking ripped.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.560
I was really, really bad.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:06.560
I had, like, a quarter of a pan of those, and I was just not feeling it.

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.560
For real?

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.560
Yeah.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.560
Literally not feeling?

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.560
I weigh more than Harvey, though, so.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:16.560
Yeah, but, like, you're also a pro.

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.560
I'm a lightweight on the marijuana.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.560
Can I correct you on that?

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:25.560
He mostly gets high for charity.

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.560
Yeah.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.560
It's really a burden.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.560
He's not a pro.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.560
I apologize, there's no pot in these cookies.

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.560
I bought them, so.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.560
That's why I'm refraining.

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.560
That's good.

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.560
I'll give them to my dog.

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.560
Yeah, anyone can have them.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.560
I think people were scared that I was trying to poison them, or they just don't like cookies,

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:43.560
which is the worst option.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:44.560
It's always possible.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.560
Everybody's worried these days.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.560
Everybody's going to poison everybody.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:48.560
All right.

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.560
You know what I say?

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:52.560
Let them poison each other.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:57.560
As long as it's not me.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:00.560
See, that would have been funny if Nate ran out right then, because we would have thought

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.560
he's a reporter.

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.560
Dan Harmon, soft on poisoning.

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:07.560
All right, Spencer, do you want to?

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:12.560
You know the reason why in Milwaukee we can't go trick-or-treating at night is because

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:18.560
of this urban legend about the idea that people put, like, victimized children during trick-or-treat.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.560
And it never happened.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.560
Like, the only instances, this is, like, a really impressive thing about our species and

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:25.560
our country.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:30.560
Like, 250 million, 300 million people going for 50 years, like, all this shit about, like,

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.560
oh, there was razor blade in your apple.

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.560
There's a poison in your thing.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.560
Trick-or-treat has been going on every year.

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.560
Kids don't get hurt.

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:42.560
The only instances, I think, the only documented instances of kids getting poisoned or hurt

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:47.560
by, like, tainted or maligned edibles during trick-or-treat.

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:57.560
I believe 100% of the cases are a shitty relative of their own home trying to pin fucking child

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:03.560
murder on society, because they hate their children and they poison, like, milk duds and

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.560
kill their fucking kid.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.560
And everybody's like, is this a theory of yours?

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.560
No, it's not.

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.560
There's, like, only one or two recorded instances when this actually occurred, and it's the

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:13.560
parents did it to their own kids.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.560
I don't think there was any deaths, though.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.560
It was exaggerated, but the kids ended up living and stuff.

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.560
Well, I'm thinking, like, often, like, I don't know, it's like, constantly, you see shit,

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.560
and then you go, like, ah, man, we're such a fucked-up species.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.560
We're so fucked up.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.560
But then, like, you always carry all this shit in your head with, like, oh, a holiday

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.560
where kids dress up as Pokemons and ask for candy?

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.560
Man, how are you going to keep people from coming in those?

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:41.560
How do you know they're not going to come all over the candy and put acid in it and then

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:46.560
stab them in the eye with a needle and it's like, they're fucked up places where your

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.560
brain goes.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:51.560
Remember when Duncan was on and we were, like, we were being programmed and he's at the mall

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:54.560
and he sees a kid and he's like, should I want to fuck that kid?

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:59.560
Like, because we're all like, like, ah, kids are fuckable and you should want to fuck kids

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.560
and murder them and kidnap them.

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.560
But it's like, we don't.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.560
We don't largely do it.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.560
And I'm not saying anybody stopped taking any precautions you've been taking, but it's

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.560
like, we don't do it.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.560
That uplifting, like trick or treat, every year, fucking kids come to the door, open

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.560
a bag, give me some candy.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.560
Nobody fucking does anything bad.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:20.560
Don't start.

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:23.560
We're all right.

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.560
We're all right people.

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:25.560
We're fine.

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:28.560
We're better than giraffes.

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:34.560
Do you know how much cum would be on your candy if you trick or treat it in a giraffe neighborhood?

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:39.560
Giraffe elephants eat shit out of each other's ass as they take their trunk and they go like,

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:43.560
you're not, you didn't digest all the grass in that, I'm eating it.

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:48.560
Chimpanzees take a frog and like, fuck, they fuck the frog to death.

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:55.560
Everybody but us on this planet, every species but us is a piece of shit murdering horrible

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.560
homicidal sociopath.

01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:03.560
What the crowd listening at home doesn't know is everyone else has left the building.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.560
We're good, we're good people.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.560
We have our moments.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.560
I'm saying that if you knew that some giraffes lived next door to you, you wouldn't go trick or treating

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:11.560
at the house.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.560
It's not.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.560
I wouldn't.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.560
I would not.

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.560
You think giraffes would have that much malice aforethought that they would cum all over

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:20.560
your snickers?

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.560
Yes.

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:22.560
Yes, I do.

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.560
Is that what you're saying, Dan?

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.560
Yes, yes, I do.

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:26.560
Or they would eat me.

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.560
They would put something, they would put some, if they're sentient giraffes.

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:30.560
Okay.

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:31.560
I don't want to go near that.

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:32.560
Giraffes are sentient.

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.560
Giraffes are not sentient.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.560
They're not?

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:40.560
Well, okay, if they are, then I'm glad that there's none here.

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:46.560
I would avoid a sentient animal like the plague, because if they're not forthcoming with their

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.560
sentience, if they're not going like, hey, over here, I'm sentient, I don't trust them.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.560
And that includes these fucking dolphins.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.560
Do you pronounce plague, plague, like baggle?

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:58.560
Did you just say plague, like the plague?

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:01.560
I think sometimes that you're part giraffe.

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:06.560
That's fucking, come all over you.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:09.560
All right, Spencer, if you would, please catch us up and bring us up to date.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.560
Oh, yeah.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.560
Girl of Shadowrun.

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:12.560
Okay.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.560
Uh.

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:14.560
Teeth.

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:24.060
Last run on Shadowtime.

01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:30.560
Our heroes had not found Baldwin Brown, but were still en route to the neutral drop zone.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:37.560
There they met with Mr. Johnson, who was less than pleased by not having Baldwin Brown in his clutches.

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.560
However, Dr. Friend eased him over with an agony spell on himself.

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:46.560
And after some strict negotiations by, uh, what's her name?

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:52.560
Mercy O'Donnell, things were smoothed over until the cops showed up.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:58.560
It was time to bone out and Eve used a flaming gorilla illusion spell to cover their escape

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.560
while they boned out in the semi truck with the Johnson.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.560
But without Baldwin, what would they do?

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.560
What would they get paid from?

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.560
Will they find him instead?

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.560
All right.

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.560
That's over.

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:23.560
You know, you don't, if you don't feel it deserves an applause, you don't need to applaud.

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:24.560
I'm just saying.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.560
It's fair.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.560
Either way.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.560
That's how I feel.

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.560
You're in the barrens.

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.560
It's early morning.

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.560
Let's say three or four in the morning.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.560
You're in a semi truck full of BTLs with the Johnson.

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.560
You think you've evaded the cops.

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:44.560
You're on an empty road winding through fields of rubble towards a building said to be hiding Baldwin Brown.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.560
Oh, we know.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:46.560
Yeah.

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:51.560
My eagle spotted him in that building and there's a magical, uh, mana barriers inside there.

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.560
Like, uh, magic barriers inside the building.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.560
Mana barriers.

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.560
Yep.

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:56.560
All right.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:59.560
I can take care of that shit.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.560
Can you?

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.560
Huh?

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.560
Well, whatever.

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.560
Don't doubt me, Spencer.

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.560
Okay.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.560
I believe in you.

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.560
Thank you, Mercy.

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:12.560
We should drive until we arrive at this place.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.560
All right.

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:14.560
I like it.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.560
Are we all in the back of a big truck?

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:19.560
You're, narratively, you could be positioned wherever you want.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.560
It'll, it'll all work out.

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.560
As I was confused about that last week.

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:24.560
Yeah.

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:25.560
Well, last week you were in the front.

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:26.560
Yeah.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:32.560
The semi truck, there's a, they call it the cab and then they call it the Holland box,

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:33.560
I think.

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.560
The bed.

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:35.560
Oh.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.560
Yeah.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:37.560
All right.

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:38.560
I'm in the Holland box.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:39.560
All right.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.560
Me too.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.560
Me too.

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:42.560
Yeah.

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.560
Okay.

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.560
I believe horticard.

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:45.560
Horticard and Mercy, I think, are up front, right?

01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:46.560
Yeah.

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.560
In the passenger seat.

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:48.560
You could be wherever you want to be.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.560
Am I using, uh, my sort of, uh, my sense of where we are going to get there?

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:53.560
Oh yeah.

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.560
You got a map, it's in your brain.

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.560
You know everywhere you're going.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:58.560
So we have a program.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:06.560
We will arrive, uh, according to, uh, uh, my sequencing, uh, I would request an estimation

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:08.560
on how long before we arrive.

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:09.560
Say what?

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:12.560
How much time before we get there?

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:13.560
Oh.

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:15.560
Well, you're getting there right now.

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:16.560
Say what?

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.560
Arriving now and stopping.

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:19.560
Definitely.

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:20.560
Okay.

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.560
We're almost there.

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:25.560
As you get closer, you pass more and more intact buildings, run down as they are.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:30.560
And also people in the early morning light congregating or standing around in the street.

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:34.560
Small barrel fires cast a warm flickering light across the streets.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.560
The truck rolls up to a stop.

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:39.560
Um, the building is just down the block.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:42.560
Unless you want to like roll up to the front of it, but you know, usually.

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.560
Yeah.

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.560
I said we, we don't park right in front of it.

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:47.560
Yeah.

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.560
So that's where you're parked.

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:50.560
Not right up in front of it.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:57.560
Can you use your sense to find out, uh, can horticard like locate where Baldwin Brown is inside this building?

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:05.560
Uh, no, but I, uh, it's in my collection of mental maps.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.560
Do I have some sort of layout of the, of the building available to me?

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.560
Not really.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.560
You just, it just looks like a small building.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:19.560
Should I astral project myself inside that building and try to get like sense where the barriers are and where, uh, where Baldwin is?

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:20.560
Who are you asking?

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.560
I'm the group though.

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:22.560
You guys okay with that?

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.560
Or you want to try another plan?

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:29.560
I was going to give him a, I was going to give him a, uh, a strength boost that might help him find Baldwin Brown.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.560
Who?

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.560
In the building.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560
Who?

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.560
Um, what's your name?

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.560
Horticard.

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:35.560
Horticard.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.560
Horticard.

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.560
Horticard.

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.560
Horticard.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.560
Horticard.

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:40.560
Horticard.

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:41.560
Horticard.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.560
Horticard.

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:43.560
Horticard.

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:44.560
Horticard.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.560
Horticard.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.560
Horticard.

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.560
I was going to give him a, a strength boost.

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:49.560
Do it.

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:50.560
Okay.

01:32:50.560 --> 01:33:01.560
This guy's a really good doctor.

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:11.560
And with that his strength is boosted.

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:15.560
So feeling, uh, very strong now?

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:18.560
You're feeling three stronger.

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.560
That's, uh, kind of a bad neighborhood.

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.560
Some ways you stay with the goods.

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:27.560
Not the kind of people you want to valet park with.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.560
Okay.

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:32.560
If you give my meaning.

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:39.560
If you ask for a project, uh, perhaps I could, uh, create some sort of mind melt between us and then we could stay in contact.

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:40.560
Okay.

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.560
While you're gone.

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:47.560
I asked for a project into the building and try to try to locate where Baldwin is with a mind meld.

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:49.560
Mind meld communication with horticard.

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:50.560
Okay.

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:51.560
That happens.

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:52.560
You're in astral form.

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:56.560
You, uh, you glide over the buildings.

01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:06.560
You glide over two large parking structures that are broken and damaged with the ravages of time and in between them nestled in a tiny, tiny spot, almost too small for a property.

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:12.560
You see, you see a vintage wooden house standing bright and cheery, squeezed in the tiny lot.

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:17.560
You see the house is made out of real live walnut wood blanks and a wood shingled roof.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:20.560
It's a real throwback to the older times.

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.560
It's yard is overgrown with plants and it's glowing.

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.560
You can see it with your astral vision.

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.560
It's glowing as you try and enter the house.

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:31.560
You're repulsed by a strong mana barrier force.

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:34.560
It's, uh, it's, it's blocking all astral travel.

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:35.560
All right.

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:39.560
Is it glowing from the mana barrier?

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:40.560
The barrier is glowing.

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.560
Right.

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.560
Um, and there's no way for me to get through that?

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.560
Not astral style.

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:56.560
Um, attacking barriers, can I take out, like, how do you attack, can I attack those with my astral, with my, um, with my war club?

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.560
You can try, but it's a tough barrier.

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.560
You can tell by looking at it.

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:06.560
I, I use my, uh, my combat focus weapon, my, uh, my Comanche War Club, and I try to attack the barrier.

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.560
Okay.

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.560
Hey, you all right?

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:13.560
You look like you're getting astrally blocked.

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:16.560
Can we communicate through comments when I'm astral?

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.560
No, you're just a ghost.

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.560
You could talk to horde guard though.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.560
I would like to relay a question from you.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:22.560
What is it?

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.560
Are you all right?

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:24.560
I don't, I'm so far so good.

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.560
There's a barrier here.

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.560
Should I try to, should I try to smack it?

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.560
Uh, I would smack, yes?

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.560
Okay, okay.

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:32.560
Why would you not?

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:40.560
I, uh, I take my Comanche War Club and harness my, uh, my club's astral attack on it.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.560
Striking with the astral form of your club, it pings harmlessly off the barrier surface.

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.560
This is some higher level magics.

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:52.560
Okay, I go back to the, to the group.

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.560
For the record, he says he is all right.

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.560
Yes, I'm all right.

01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.560
Okay, so guys, there's a, there's a, there's a big mana barrier.

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:01.560
It's magic that's beyond my capabilities.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.560
I don't, I don't know how to get through that.

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.560
Oh, well, you know what they say.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:09.560
Uh, what, what do they say?

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:22.560
Bigger the mana barrier, lower the, uh, the defense against conventional, uh, assault.

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:27.560
I assume.

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.560
Okay, can I, can I counter spell against it?

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:32.560
Uh, no.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:33.560
Shit.

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:37.560
Could I give him a spell that would increase his body size?

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.560
Her.

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.560
I'm a she.

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.560
Sorry?

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:41.560
I'm a girl.

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.560
I'm so, I'm sorry.

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:44.560
It's all right.

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:45.560
My name is Ewe World.

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:46.560
I'm sorry.

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:47.560
I didn't know that.

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:48.560
You could, yeah.

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:49.560
You have to ask.

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:50.560
It's a callback.

01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:58.560
Camera two, camera three, camera one, camera four.

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:05.560
Harvett Charles is brought to you by Snuggles Fabris Offender.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:09.560
If you casted the increased body and make him tougher to kill and more resilient.

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.560
But it won't help him get through the barrier.

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:12.560
Not on its own.

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.560
No.

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.560
Okay.

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:17.560
Could, uh, perhaps it be, uh, what is it that you have?

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:20.560
You have a sort of a light whip?

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:21.560
Yeah.

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:22.560
Whip.

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:23.560
Yeah.

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:24.560
Yeah.

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.560
Nano whip in my finger.

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.560
Yeah.

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.560
Is it, is it, uh, is that sort of barrier?

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:33.560
Is it sort of, uh, vulnerable to, uh, to the whip?

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:36.560
Uh, okay.

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.560
You look that question up on the future net.

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:42.560
Wait, it's called the matrix in this game.

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.560
You look it up on the matrix and you find out that mana barriers are not affected by

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.560
physical manner.

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:50.560
Does somebody stay here and, uh, protect the gear?

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.560
Uh, I should head in there.

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.560
It seems like, uh, also, I mean, I could go in there.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.560
I have mana spells.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:00.560
I could go in there and cast like a high level, uh, mana bolt and try to knock it out that

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:01.560
way too.

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:03.560
But I am getting a little drained.

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:05.560
Have I rested or do I still have the drain?

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.560
No, you're still drained.

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:07.560
Okay.

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.560
I've got a few, I have a few bits of drain left in me.

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.560
Yeah, you're about half.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:23.560
That's what the people on the streets are saying things.

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:26.560
So do we know the security system on the outside of the building?

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:30.560
No, you only have seen the wooden exterior of the house.

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.560
Oh yeah, you're a hacker, right?

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.560
Like, no.

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:36.560
I have a key card copier.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.560
That's true.

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:41.560
And I also have an auto picker, which I would think would be locks.

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:46.560
Um, I go and inspect the front door or entrance to the building.

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.560
You cross through the green yard and past the yellow mailbox that has the name the

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:52.560
yellowman's painted on the side.

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:55.560
You go up to the front door that's painted blue.

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.560
The woods, I mean, the paint is shipping.

01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.560
It's old as hell, but it's a classic throwback lock.

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:03.560
You could definitely pick it with that lock picker.

01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.560
I pick it with, I pick the lock.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.560
Alright.

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:08.560
Can I be following her?

01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:13.560
No, as well, because I watched my magic friends fail to, so I, we're leaving the

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:19.560
Holland, Holland truck and I'm going to go into, going with the physical people.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.560
I will follow, I will follow as well, but behind.

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.560
Rear guard for protection.

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.560
Thank you.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.560
I'm staying, I'm staying in the car.

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.560
Alright.

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:32.560
I'm, I'm inside the truck, but I'm still going to be in the astral plane right now

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.560
kind of overseeing things.

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.560
I'm telling you, somebody should, somebody should stay with the truck.

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.560
It's like a joke in an 80s movie.

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:39.560
We're going to come back.

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:44.560
It's going to be on blocks.

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.560
It's a bad neighborhood.

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.560
This guy likes cookies.

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:52.560
They're pretty dry, but they're good.

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:55.560
Speaking of dry, can I have a water?

01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:57.560
It's because of him.

01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:58.560
Nate?

01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.560
Nate, right?

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.560
Spencer has one.

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.560
Does Spencer have a water?

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.560
Yeah.

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.560
There you go.

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.560
He was in my pocket.

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:06.560
Alright, so the, so the little worm, but it's still what?

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:09.560
The mana barrier is not covering the outside of the house.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:10.560
It's covering the whole house.

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.560
It is.

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:12.560
It's like, it's like paint.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:14.560
So what, what lock is she picking the one on the house itself?

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.560
Front door.

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.560
Yup.

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.560
Okay.

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:20.560
So is the chipped paint mean that, that portion is down?

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.560
Nope.

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:24.560
I'm in a like paint in that it covered the entire thing.

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:25.560
I'm sorry.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:26.560
That's confusing.

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:35.560
You pick the door and it slides open silently, which is odd for an old wooden house.

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.560
Is the barrier still there?

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:40.560
Well, she, no, no, you can only see it when you're in the astral plane.

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.560
No one else can see any barriers.

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.560
Okay.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.560
It's like an astral barrier.

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:50.560
I would like to use my sense of detecting enemies to see if there are any enemies I can detect.

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:54.560
You detect two enemies inside.

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:58.560
But with any sort of specificity location?

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.560
No, all you could do is detect your presence.

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.560
The number is two, there are two enemies.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.560
Thanks.

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:09.560
All right, well, get ready to change that number.

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.560
Meaning there are three?

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.560
What?

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:13.560
What?

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.560
A rare joke from Horthegard.

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.560
No, I don't mean change it.

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.560
Don't change it randomly.

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:23.560
I'm going to change it by killing people.

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.560
That's a guy.

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:30.560
I go back to the truck, go back into the physical world, and I say, guys, there's a mana barrier.

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:34.560
You're not getting in there. There's a magical force field around this house.

01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.560
You're not getting in there.

01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:38.560
Well, I guess you're talking to a friend because everyone else is outside the truck.

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:39.560
That's right.

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:40.560
I'm the only one who stayed in the truck.

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:41.560
Not on comm links?

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:42.560
I can't say that.

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:43.560
Oh, sure.

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.560
Yeah.

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.560
I report that on comm to everybody.

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.560
That happens.

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:48.560
Why don't you guys get to know each other?

01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:54.560
Just suggesting as a player, like, it could be a fun scene.

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:55.560
Me and the doctor?

01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.560
Yeah.

01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:04.560
Hey, doc, remember what you said back there about, you know, me maybe.

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:05.560
You could have done better than this.

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.560
I could have done better than this.

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:12.560
You know, it's hard because, you know, we live in this world that just every step you take seems like a step back.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:20.560
Every time you do something, it wants to, it just reinforces the fact that you're not supposed to be free and not supposed to be happy.

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:22.560
And like, I've never felt like I deserve happiness.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.560
It's not true.

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:30.560
You're a decent girl.

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:32.560
You could have anything.

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:35.560
I just don't want your life to be like mine.

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.560
I want to find my parents.

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:45.560
My parents are stuck working for mega corporations and their magic is being used like prostituted.

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:51.560
I know, I know.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:54.560
They didn't even know if I'm alive or dead, doc.

01:42:54.560 --> 01:43:08.560
Look, I don't know if you know anything about me, but I used to be a very well respected doctor.

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:10.560
What happened?

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:14.560
Do you remember when the president was shot?

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:15.560
Yes.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:19.560
I was the doctor who attempted to save his life.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.560
Wow.

01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.560
But I'd been drinking.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:30.560
He died on the table under my hands.

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.560
It destroyed me.

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:39.560
I just went from bad to worse after that and then I wound up here with these people.

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:46.560
I'm just telling you, thank you, I'm just telling you that you could save yourself now.

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.560
Go find your parents.

01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:49.560
Start your life all over again.

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:53.560
What you're telling me is that you found yourself at the bottom of the barrel just like the rest of us.

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.560
We're nobody's, we're nothing's.

01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:01.560
I'm more of a nothing than you are.

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:09.560
Maybe you should take your own advice and put some of that healing power on your own soul, your own self.

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:12.560
Maybe you're right.

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.560
I kissed the doctor.

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:21.560
Okay.

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:25.560
We start really making that.

01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:30.560
Stop, they're coming.

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:35.560
We're not coming.

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:39.560
But you may have forgot to turn off your comlink.

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.560
Oh shit God damn it.

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.560
Oh my God, that's embarrassing.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:45.560
How much did you guys hear?

01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:46.560
How much did you guys hear?

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:47.560
All of it.

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:48.560
Oh shit.

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.560
100%

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:53.560
Can I just say we're all shadow runners?

01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:57.560
You know, the stuff, the themes I'm hearing, I've heard on a lot of shadow runs.

01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:00.560
You know, we are all misfits.

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:07.560
I don't think there's anyone that should be saying to anybody else, you know, you more than me.

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.560
It's like, come on, this is the life we chose.

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:10.560
Hey, you know what guys?

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:11.560
Okay.

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.560
Little pow wow.

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.560
Everybody huddle up.

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:16.560
Well we can't, we're at the house.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:20.560
Okay, I go.

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:21.560
Okay, comlink huddle up.

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:23.560
Let's just just comlink huddle up.

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:27.560
Everybody pretend you're in a physical huddle.

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.560
We're the bottom of the barrel.

01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.560
But we have a job to do.

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:39.560
And everything that we do right from here on forward gets us a little bit higher, makes us a little bit better people.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:43.560
I don't know who this guy, Mr. Johnson, is, or what he wants from Baldwin Brown.

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.560
Yeah, should I be on this call or not?

01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.560
Oh, shit.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.560
Wait, is he listening the whole time?

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:50.560
Yeah.

01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:52.560
Baldwin Brown?

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.560
No, wait, Johnson.

01:45:54.560 --> 01:46:01.560
Who keeps hitting send all?

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:07.560
It's a lot like sort of this joke that we have about the Norwegian family.

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:11.560
Where for example, maybe this one comes from Stavanger.

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:14.560
And maybe this one comes from Bergen.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:17.560
And maybe this one comes from Trondheim.

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:19.560
I am of course from Oslo.

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:22.560
And this one is the angry one.

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:24.560
Angry at the oil is being taken from his place.

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:26.560
He has all the money in the world.

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.560
But it's being sent to other places in Norway.

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.560
But we're all one family.

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.560
And end of story.

01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.560
So for precision sake, we're all one family.

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:42.560
Thanks for dumbing that down for us.

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.560
I really clarified it.

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:49.560
I go back into the Astral Plane and I go at it and I throw a Force V mana bolt at the barrier.

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.560
Okay.

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:53.560
What's your magic plus spell casting?

01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:56.560
Seven and plus six.

01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:59.560
I think the mana barrier is just a thing that's there.

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:04.560
It strikes it and absorbs into the mana barrier's surface.

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.560
The end?

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:07.560
I mean what?

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.560
That's it.

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.560
That's it for that mana bolt.

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.560
But not for this story.

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:16.560
Time for action.

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:20.560
Fight gun engaged.

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:21.560
Alright.

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:22.560
Eve?

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.560
Is that her name?

01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:24.560
Yep.

01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:25.560
Alright.

01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:26.560
Come out to the coast.

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.560
Have a few laughs.

01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:32.560
I've got two bogies somewhere in here.

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:34.560
I sweep the room.

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:35.560
I take him by surroundings.

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.560
What do I see?

01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.560
You see the front room.

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:40.560
There's two large couches and all sorts of framed photos.

01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:42.560
And light coming in from the kitchen.

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:43.560
Well he's in the room?

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:44.560
Apparently.

01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:45.560
What's the point of that?

01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:47.560
You can walk through a mana barrier.

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:51.560
Motherfucker, you don't have to.

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:53.560
Oh, so it just keeps out magic?

01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:54.560
It keeps out magic.

01:47:54.560 --> 01:48:00.560
I don't know everything about magic, you guys.

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:03.560
Again the people from the streets?

01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560
They know.

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:06.560
Street smarts.

01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:07.560
I check my zones.

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.560
I check my zones.

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.560
Yeah, you see light coming from the kitchen and you hear movement.

01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:19.560
You see an old lady ruffling around in the fridge.

01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:20.560
She doesn't seem to notice you.

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:24.560
It must be your intense stealth capabilities.

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.560
Or she's a robot.

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:33.560
Just like my parents.

01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.560
I holster my weapon.

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:36.560
Alright.

01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:41.560
And I use my social skills.

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:45.560
What do you do with them?

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:48.560
Hey mom.

01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:49.560
Jesse?

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:51.560
Is that you?

01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:53.560
Yeah, it's me, Jersey.

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:56.560
Are you home, Jesse?

01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:02.560
Yes, I'm home.

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.560
Oh, it's been so long, my eyes.

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:06.560
They're not good.

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:07.560
I brought a girl with me.

01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:08.560
I hope it's okay.

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:11.560
I know you're old fashioned, but times are changing.

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:12.560
Alright.

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:15.560
Just have fun down in the basement like you always do.

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.560
Okay, cool.

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.560
I go back in physical form again.

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:20.560
Okay.

01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:22.560
You're in the truck, right?

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:25.560
I go back and join him, I think, right?

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:26.560
What's going on with you?

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:27.560
I don't know.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:28.560
You said you brought a girl.

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.560
You meant me?

01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:30.560
No, I meant...

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:31.560
Oh, Mercy.

01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:32.560
Okay, I'm in the truck.

01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:33.560
Alright.

01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:39.560
Being very embarrassed about the whole Man of Barrier experience.

01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:40.560
Alright.

01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:44.560
So you said that there were two people in the room?

01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:47.560
Two enemies were scouted in the house.

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:49.560
Okay.

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:52.560
So I'm going to put on my spy monocle.

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.560
Alright.

01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:57.560
What's the setup of the lower level of the house?

01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:02.560
The kitchen leads to the basement for some reason.

01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:06.560
I use my stealth to get by the grandma.

01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:12.560
And I go down into the basement and I use my spy monocle to see my surroundings.

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:13.560
Alright.

01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:20.560
It's really dark, but you can see two sleeping figures and a small metallic dome in the darkness.

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.560
They're sleeping in the basement.

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.560
They're not in the dome.

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:25.560
The dome is separate.

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:26.560
It's nearby.

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:28.560
I head down the stairs as well.

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:31.560
I draw my Aries predator.

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:32.560
You do that.

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:33.560
Silence or equipped?

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:35.560
Does anyone else do anything?

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.560
I am in the kitchen right now.

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.560
I think you're outside the house probably.

01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.560
Well, then I enter the house.

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:45.560
The old lady's like, oh, Jesse, Scott's some friends.

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:48.560
Just tell her you're Jesse's friends.

01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:56.560
I tell her I am a friend of Jesse's and I'm just outside waiting for him to grab his effects.

01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:57.560
Okay.

01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:59.560
Would you like a coffee?

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:04.560
Let me use my power to analyze truth to see if this is really coffee.

01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:05.560
It is.

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:06.560
It is.

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:12.560
I will enjoy coffee.

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.560
You got to take the coffee or should I?

01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.560
But will he really enjoy the coffee?

01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:21.560
Find out next time on Shadow Rock.

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:27.560
Cliff Hanger!

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:32.560
All right.

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:33.560
Thank you so much, Jen, everybody.

01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:40.560
Jen helping us out at Mercy.

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:56.560
So now you're an asshole if you don't.

01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:00.560
And next week we're going to go in that house and kick a whole ton of ass in there, right?

01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:01.560
Yeah.

01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:02.560
All right.

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:03.560
Thank you, everybody.

01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:06.560
Dan Harmon, your mayor, everybody.

01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:11.560
Thank you, Chris and Zach and Dustin back in the booth.

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:13.560
And we'll see you next week.

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.560
Oh, and watch King of the Nerds on Fridays on TBS.

01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:16.560
That's right.

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:21.560
Finale on Friday, 9 o'clock.

01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:23.560
Did you get any of that?

01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:28.560
It's a good show.

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:38.560
Feral Audio.
