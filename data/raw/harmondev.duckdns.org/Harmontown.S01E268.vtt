{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:13.480\nHello, I realized last time I did the Spencer dance wrong.\n\n00:13.480 --> 00:20.400\nFrom Uptown Verbank, Harmontown is now in 6th.\n\n00:20.400 --> 00:25.160\nSomebody make a meme out of that shit.\n\n00:25.160 --> 00:26.640\nYou know, Spencer, where'd you go?\n\n00:26.640 --> 00:27.920\nLet's pick up our Game Master.\n\n00:27.920 --> 00:33.920\nSpencer Crittenden with his bag of holding.\n\n00:33.920 --> 00:36.440\nWhat you got in that bag?\n\n00:36.440 --> 00:39.080\nBooks, books, books and dice.\n\n00:39.080 --> 00:43.640\nGonna play D&D, gonna go real nice.\n\n00:43.640 --> 00:46.080\nWhat you got in that sack?\n\n00:46.080 --> 00:48.520\nJust some games and a shit to get back on.\n\n00:48.520 --> 00:52.120\nIs it true that you're going to roll some dice?\n\n00:52.120 --> 00:53.040\nIt's true, man.\n\n00:53.040 --> 00:55.880\nIt's true that I got head lice.\n\n00:55.880 --> 01:00.320\nThat's a parasite on your head.\n\n01:00.320 --> 01:01.760\nYou should see a doctor.\n\n01:01.760 --> 01:03.760\nLet's bring up your mayor, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:14.760 --> 01:16.360\nThe beat rolls through me.\n\n01:16.360 --> 01:17.120\nI'm an artist.\n\n01:17.120 --> 01:18.480\nI'm a poet.\n\n01:18.480 --> 01:21.080\nI fucked your mama and she didn't even know it.\n\n01:21.080 --> 01:23.280\nI'm a stealth fucker.\n\n01:23.280 --> 01:26.520\nI roll in, got bad luck or something.\n\n01:26.520 --> 01:29.880\nWhen I go in, I've got a tiny little wiener\n\n01:29.880 --> 01:32.360\nso she didn't know.\n\n01:32.360 --> 01:33.920\nIt's like a cave.\n\n01:33.920 --> 01:35.640\nHear me blow.\n\n01:35.640 --> 01:38.160\nYo, echo.\n\n01:38.160 --> 01:39.800\nIt's not your mama's pissies.\n\n01:39.800 --> 01:42.000\nIt's the problem.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:42.880\nBoy, oh boy.\n\n01:42.880 --> 01:45.840\nYou guys threw me because.\n\n01:45.840 --> 01:46.880\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:46.880 --> 01:48.200\nThat sounded accusatory.\n\n01:48.200 --> 01:50.920\nThat sounded blamful and shameful.\n\n01:50.920 --> 01:54.880\nI'm just saying my rap is more shameful than it would have been\n\n01:54.880 --> 02:01.960\nif I hadn't been overshadowed by professional rappers,\n\n02:01.960 --> 02:02.640\nRachel Maddow.\n\n02:06.240 --> 02:08.520\nDo a rap as Rachel Maddow.\n\n02:08.520 --> 02:10.720\nAll right.\n\n02:10.720 --> 02:15.960\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n02:15.960 --> 02:20.200\nI got a long neck and my head's in the stars.\n\n02:20.200 --> 02:22.480\nRachel Maddow coming at you tonight.\n\n02:22.480 --> 02:26.440\nI got some left-leaning news to make you feel all right.\n\n02:26.440 --> 02:30.560\nIn spite of Nazis taking over the USA,\n\n02:30.560 --> 02:33.000\nI'm popular and not because I'm gay.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:37.000\nIt's just the reason you can trust me.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:38.640\nDon't fuck with me.\n\n02:38.640 --> 02:44.960\nI got a really long neck so I can see better than you.\n\n02:44.960 --> 02:48.480\nWhat's going on?\n\n02:48.480 --> 02:50.360\nRachel Maddow.\n\n02:50.360 --> 02:51.840\nI haven't watched her in a while.\n\n02:51.840 --> 02:54.160\nWait, OK.\n\n02:54.160 --> 02:55.680\nHello, Zach.\n\n02:55.680 --> 02:57.120\nZac McKeever on.\n\n02:57.120 --> 02:58.520\nDid I just out Rachel Maddow?\n\n02:58.520 --> 03:01.800\nWell, you certainly added her as having a long neck.\n\n03:01.800 --> 03:02.720\nNo, people know that.\n\n03:02.720 --> 03:05.520\nAnd she celebrates it, I think, with her.\n\n03:05.520 --> 03:07.680\nIf you were ashamed of your very long neck,\n\n03:07.680 --> 03:10.040\nyou would not wear what Rachel Maddow wears.\n\n03:10.040 --> 03:11.760\nThis is not me objectifying her.\n\n03:11.760 --> 03:14.440\nI think you're certainly neck-shaming.\n\n03:14.440 --> 03:17.200\nI think he's neck-celebrating.\n\n03:17.200 --> 03:21.040\nLike I believe she is, I'm neck-celebrating.\n\n03:21.040 --> 03:25.240\nNow we've learned from her what the next thing that happens\n\n03:25.240 --> 03:28.960\nis that Rachel is doing an AMA and somebody says,\n\n03:28.960 --> 03:31.440\nDan Harmon says you have a shamefully long neck\n\n03:31.440 --> 03:34.320\nand that you dress like you should be ashamed.\n\n03:34.320 --> 03:35.680\nWhat are your comments on that?\n\n03:35.680 --> 03:37.480\nAnd then we're beefing.\n\n03:37.480 --> 03:38.880\nOh, well, now we're beefing.\n\n03:38.880 --> 03:40.920\nBeefing with Maddow.\n\n03:40.920 --> 03:41.880\nBeefing with me.\n\n03:41.880 --> 03:44.480\nNow we're in a reservoir of dogs crossfire\n\n03:44.480 --> 03:48.040\nwith Ron Jeremy and Rachel Maddow.\n\n03:51.040 --> 03:54.320\nAnyways, that's the danger of opening your show with rapping.\n\n03:54.320 --> 03:58.760\nBut I've found that opening the show with a little freestyle\n\n03:58.760 --> 04:01.880\ngets my energy up.\n\n04:01.880 --> 04:03.120\nIt's a classic improv.\n\n04:03.120 --> 04:05.760\nIt would be the sound of thunderous applause.\n\n04:08.880 --> 04:10.720\nDo you have a burp in the chamber right now, Dan?\n\n04:10.720 --> 04:13.080\nCan you do a word burp?\n\n04:13.080 --> 04:15.720\nYes.\n\n04:15.720 --> 04:16.840\nWell, there it goes.\n\n04:16.840 --> 04:18.920\nBecause Church and I do a lot of word burping.\n\n04:18.920 --> 04:22.400\nAnd we try to get Steve Agee to do a thing where he just burps\n\n04:22.400 --> 04:23.440\nwords.\n\n04:23.440 --> 04:28.440\nAnd it's hard to do multi-syllabic word burps.\n\n04:28.440 --> 04:31.280\nAnd one burp, I want it.\n\n04:31.280 --> 04:34.520\nIf you can pull this off, you'll be my hero.\n\n04:34.520 --> 04:38.840\nIf you can word burp, White House AIDS.\n\n04:38.840 --> 04:44.440\nI have to swallow air.\n\n04:44.440 --> 04:46.440\nWhite House AIDS.\n\n04:46.440 --> 04:48.920\nNo.\n\n04:48.920 --> 04:53.800\nAIDS had a little bit of vomit drop coming up on it.\n\n04:53.800 --> 04:55.840\nYeah, I haven't done that in a while.\n\n04:55.840 --> 04:58.440\nJust once can someone burp women's rights.\n\n04:58.440 --> 05:00.280\nFor God's sake.\n\n05:00.280 --> 05:04.280\nTry to burp women's rights.\n\n05:04.280 --> 05:05.680\nWell, how have you guys been?\n\n05:05.680 --> 05:06.880\nWe had a Thanksgiving weekend.\n\n05:06.880 --> 05:07.760\nWhat did you guys do?\n\n05:07.760 --> 05:08.960\nLet's start with Spencer.\n\n05:08.960 --> 05:10.800\nI went to Dino's.\n\n05:10.800 --> 05:13.080\nYeah, it was good.\n\n05:13.080 --> 05:15.560\nI wanted to make a recipe to bring there.\n\n05:15.560 --> 05:21.880\nBut then I decided to just bring Coke, not the drug, the drink.\n\n05:21.880 --> 05:23.960\nAnd it went over really well.\n\n05:23.960 --> 05:26.720\nPeople were like, man, I love this party.\n\n05:26.720 --> 05:30.600\nBut the only thing to drink is hard liquor and wine.\n\n05:30.600 --> 05:32.040\nAnd then I was like, I got you.\n\n05:32.040 --> 05:33.480\nAnd then people were digging it.\n\n05:33.480 --> 05:35.640\nAnd I was like, yeah, this is the right move.\n\n05:35.640 --> 05:37.080\nHe made a lot of good food.\n\n05:37.080 --> 05:38.560\nIt was good.\n\n05:38.560 --> 05:40.200\nThere wasn't a lot of crazy people there,\n\n05:40.200 --> 05:41.560\nwhich there are occasionally.\n\n05:41.560 --> 05:43.640\nSo it was a real fun time.\n\n05:43.640 --> 05:47.240\nWhat do you feel about his garlic levels as a chef?\n\n05:47.240 --> 05:49.080\nThey're high, but that's what I like.\n\n05:49.080 --> 05:52.280\nI'd say the garlic levels in the Thanksgiving dinner\n\n05:52.280 --> 05:54.440\nwere lower than normal.\n\n05:54.440 --> 05:58.320\nDino usually makes Greek food to go with the Thanksgiving\n\n05:58.320 --> 05:58.600\nfood.\n\n05:58.600 --> 05:59.640\nSo he'll make a turkey.\n\n05:59.640 --> 06:03.280\nAnd then he'll make some crazy beef stew stuff.\n\n06:03.280 --> 06:05.120\nAnd he didn't really have any of that.\n\n06:05.120 --> 06:07.080\nIt was just traditional Thanksgiving stuff,\n\n06:07.080 --> 06:08.120\nwhich I was thankful for.\n\n06:08.120 --> 06:11.840\nI mean, I like Greek food, but Thanksgiving.\n\n06:11.840 --> 06:13.560\nYeah.\n\n06:13.560 --> 06:14.060\nDan?\n\n06:14.060 --> 06:14.560\nJeffrey?\n\n06:14.560 --> 06:16.200\nYeah, let's go to you.\n\n06:16.200 --> 06:17.040\nOh, me?\n\n06:17.040 --> 06:20.200\nI went to Florida with Cody and visited with my parents,\n\n06:20.200 --> 06:24.320\nwhich is I haven't been down to Florida in a long time\n\n06:24.320 --> 06:25.360\nto visit the parents.\n\n06:25.360 --> 06:32.040\nAnd our main activity was Balderdash, which is like,\n\n06:32.040 --> 06:37.520\nmy family is like, we walk a razor's edge as a tribe.\n\n06:37.520 --> 06:43.520\nLike, we're not, we don't have unconditional love.\n\n06:43.520 --> 06:47.200\nLike, love is, in the Harmon family,\n\n06:47.200 --> 06:52.120\nit's a loose knit alliance of nefarious bounty hunters who\n\n06:52.120 --> 06:58.680\nare all just trying to make sure that the galaxy doesn't\n\n06:58.680 --> 07:00.120\nget plunged into war.\n\n07:00.120 --> 07:06.640\nBut it's, and so if you break out monopoly or trivial pursuit,\n\n07:06.640 --> 07:08.320\nyou could be asking for trouble.\n\n07:08.320 --> 07:09.600\nHow big was the squad?\n\n07:09.600 --> 07:10.760\nIt was you and Cody and the parents?\n\n07:10.760 --> 07:11.760\nJust the four of us.\n\n07:11.760 --> 07:12.240\nReally?\n\n07:12.240 --> 07:12.760\nYeah.\n\n07:12.760 --> 07:16.680\nAnd but Balderdash, I've found for my family,\n\n07:16.680 --> 07:18.520\nis this just amazing.\n\n07:18.520 --> 07:20.640\nIt's every man for himself.\n\n07:20.640 --> 07:23.200\nNo, that's an outdated expression, sorry.\n\n07:23.200 --> 07:26.520\nTwo of them were women that were out for themselves.\n\n07:26.520 --> 07:29.480\nLadies, be out for yourselves.\n\n07:29.480 --> 07:31.160\nThank God they finally got that message\n\n07:31.160 --> 07:35.040\nfrom someone they could trust.\n\n07:35.040 --> 07:37.280\nBut Balderdash is like, there's no teams.\n\n07:37.280 --> 07:42.360\nAnd there's also, any time pressure is self-imposed.\n\n07:42.360 --> 07:45.240\nWe decided after a while, let's take no longer than two minutes\n\n07:45.240 --> 07:46.600\nto write an answer.\n\n07:46.600 --> 07:47.680\nRefresh my memory.\n\n07:47.680 --> 07:51.360\nBalderdash is what you lie about a thing.\n\n07:51.360 --> 07:54.400\nYou have to figure out who's telling the truth.\n\n07:54.400 --> 07:56.480\nDo they give you one real definition?\n\n07:56.480 --> 07:58.480\nOr you've got to, there's a word and you\n\n07:58.480 --> 07:59.960\nhave to guess the definition.\n\n07:59.960 --> 08:02.320\nWell, I think I can, just knowing what Jeff knows,\n\n08:02.320 --> 08:05.480\nI think I can explain it fast to him\n\n08:05.480 --> 08:08.440\nby saying it's basically the Leonard Malton movie guide\n\n08:08.440 --> 08:09.240\ngame.\n\n08:09.240 --> 08:12.480\nBut there's five more categories than movies.\n\n08:12.480 --> 08:14.360\nAnd you can just, the way we play it,\n\n08:14.360 --> 08:15.240\nyou can just pick movies.\n\n08:15.240 --> 08:17.080\nSo it could be a definition of a word.\n\n08:17.080 --> 08:17.720\nRight.\n\n08:17.720 --> 08:19.200\nSo there's acronyms.\n\n08:19.200 --> 08:20.640\nSo there'll just be a jumble of letters.\n\n08:20.640 --> 08:22.760\nThat's my least favorite one, because I feel like I'm doing\n\n08:22.760 --> 08:23.320\nhomework.\n\n08:23.320 --> 08:26.920\nI just feel like I'm not, it's not about creativity.\n\n08:26.920 --> 08:32.400\nIt's just like I-H-C. And then the people just\n\n08:32.400 --> 08:36.400\nwrite, International Housing Committee of, you know,\n\n08:36.400 --> 08:38.560\nI hate tarp.\n\n08:41.200 --> 08:44.760\nAnd the cool thing, the genius of Balderdash,\n\n08:44.760 --> 08:47.320\nas far as the actual publishers of the game,\n\n08:47.320 --> 08:52.960\nwhat they really did write, in my opinion, is they clearly,\n\n08:52.960 --> 08:54.040\nthere's real answers.\n\n08:54.040 --> 08:57.160\nThere's one real answer on the, you know, I-H-C\n\n08:57.160 --> 09:00.120\ndoes stand for something in the real world out there\n\n09:00.120 --> 09:03.120\nsomewhere.\n\n09:03.120 --> 09:06.280\nBut also, there's all these movies that no one's ever seen.\n\n09:06.280 --> 09:14.800\nSo the title will be like, Blue Marble Babies.\n\n09:14.800 --> 09:18.920\nAnd there's some movie out there called Blue Marble Babies.\n\n09:18.920 --> 09:22.560\nYou don't know if it's like Dollywood or Bollywood.\n\n09:22.560 --> 09:24.120\nOr Dollywood.\n\n09:24.120 --> 09:25.640\nBut maybe, I think they've started to greenlight\n\n09:25.640 --> 09:28.920\nmore projects this fiscal quarter.\n\n09:28.920 --> 09:30.120\nWe're pulling for Dollywood.\n\n09:30.120 --> 09:31.920\nI don't know if they're going to catch up to Bollywood.\n\n09:31.920 --> 09:35.440\nBut you don't know where it's from.\n\n09:35.440 --> 09:37.480\nYou just know that there is a movie out there called\n\n09:37.480 --> 09:39.600\nThe Blue Marble Babies.\n\n09:39.600 --> 09:42.320\nThe genius of the Balderdash publishers\n\n09:42.320 --> 09:48.760\nis that whoever they had write the real answer, which might be,\n\n09:48.760 --> 09:52.640\nit's a log line for the movie Blue Marble Babies.\n\n09:52.640 --> 09:54.800\nAnd then they have the people that write them,\n\n09:54.800 --> 10:03.680\nthey write them in kind of a fucking Schrab.\n\n10:03.680 --> 10:06.120\nSchrab.is here.\n\n10:06.120 --> 10:06.680\nYeah.\n\n10:06.680 --> 10:07.360\nI let him in.\n\n10:14.420 --> 10:16.160\nHello, Rob.\n\n10:16.160 --> 10:17.320\nHappy Thanksgiving, Rob.\n\n10:21.160 --> 10:22.400\nThank you.\n\n10:22.400 --> 10:24.000\nThere's no camera over here, right?\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.800\nThere's no churches again.\n\n10:26.800 --> 10:27.440\nNo, there's not.\n\n10:27.440 --> 10:29.600\nYou don't want to disrupt.\n\n10:29.600 --> 10:30.840\nThere's no.\n\n10:30.840 --> 10:32.040\nThis isn't about you.\n\n10:32.040 --> 10:33.240\nJeff, I was trying.\n\n10:33.240 --> 10:35.280\nI couldn't find it anyway.\n\n10:35.280 --> 10:36.160\nI was looking, though.\n\n10:36.160 --> 10:37.520\nMaybe you will have better luck.\n\n10:37.520 --> 10:39.320\nWe were trying to find the Balder Dash game\n\n10:39.320 --> 10:41.560\nso we could play it live on stage.\n\n10:41.560 --> 10:44.920\nI thought it was something that we could do around tonight\n\n10:44.920 --> 10:45.480\nto test it.\n\n10:45.480 --> 10:47.080\nBut I really actually think it'd be really funny.\n\n10:47.080 --> 10:49.400\nI think that Benson basically plays the Lunnert\n\n10:49.400 --> 10:52.840\nMalton movie game on his movie podcast.\n\n10:52.840 --> 10:53.560\nGetting Doug.\n\n10:53.560 --> 10:54.360\nNo.\n\n10:54.360 --> 10:56.920\nNo, Doug loves movies.\n\n10:56.920 --> 10:57.400\nOK.\n\n10:57.400 --> 10:57.880\nSorry.\n\n10:57.880 --> 10:58.760\nI got it mixed up.\n\n10:58.760 --> 10:59.240\nDoesn't matter.\n\n10:59.240 --> 11:00.480\nIt's a different podcast network.\n\n11:00.480 --> 11:02.280\nWe don't care if they live or die.\n\n11:02.280 --> 11:06.280\nAnd to tell you the truth, if it was a choice between them dying\n\n11:06.280 --> 11:10.160\nand us saving some bread for, I don't know,\n\n11:10.160 --> 11:14.280\nCameron Esposito or one of our tribe,\n\n11:14.280 --> 11:16.800\nlike what are we supposed to do, you know?\n\n11:16.800 --> 11:19.400\nKill or be killed in the podcast wars.\n\n11:19.400 --> 11:22.640\nValuable Warby Parker dollars are being battled over.\n\n11:22.640 --> 11:26.000\nSo Dan, it was you, Cody, your mom and your dad,\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:30.320\nstuck in the confines of Florida.\n\n11:30.320 --> 11:31.520\nAnd how'd it go?\n\n11:31.520 --> 11:32.040\nIt was great.\n\n11:32.040 --> 11:33.080\nIt was really great.\n\n11:33.080 --> 11:36.560\nAnd my parents have a little tiny electric boat.\n\n11:36.560 --> 11:41.840\nThey live in a neighborhood of, wait, they have an electric boat?\n\n11:41.840 --> 11:43.880\nYeah, my parents moved, or Wisconsinites\n\n11:43.880 --> 11:45.400\nthat moved to Florida.\n\n11:45.400 --> 11:47.960\nThat's the dream of every Wisconsinite.\n\n11:47.960 --> 11:50.360\nYou don't go to California because California\n\n11:50.360 --> 11:56.120\nhas drugs, foreign people, and is going to fall into the sea.\n\n11:56.120 --> 12:00.320\nThat's what Florida is perfect for, yeah.\n\n12:00.320 --> 12:07.400\nA drug-free, all-American, totally globally shielded,\n\n12:07.400 --> 12:12.480\nabsolutely no natural disasters imminent.\n\n12:12.480 --> 12:14.920\nBut it's all about boat culture there.\n\n12:14.920 --> 12:16.800\nMy parents moved into a little neighborhood\n\n12:16.800 --> 12:19.800\nthat's kind of upper-middle-class retirement\n\n12:19.800 --> 12:25.720\nsuburb with, although I don't know if that's true anymore,\n\n12:25.720 --> 12:31.400\nso savior flame wars when you fact-check this.\n\n12:31.400 --> 12:33.360\nBut there's canals.\n\n12:33.360 --> 12:36.200\nThere's neighborhoods of Florida where everyone has\n\n12:36.200 --> 12:39.080\na canal in their backyard instead of an alley,\n\n12:39.080 --> 12:40.680\nwhere you'd have an alley because you're\n\n12:40.680 --> 12:45.360\na dirty, urban, horrible break dancer.\n\n12:45.360 --> 12:46.760\nYou have streets.\n\n12:46.760 --> 12:48.840\nI've been accused of that before.\n\n12:48.840 --> 12:54.040\nAnd then the non-address facing conduit is an alley.\n\n12:54.040 --> 12:56.640\nOnly instead of crackpipes, there's manatee.\n\n12:56.640 --> 12:59.600\nHow do we play Balder Dash live right now?\n\n12:59.600 --> 13:04.280\nWe would have to find a Balder Dash set of cards.\n\n13:04.280 --> 13:09.320\nJust any card from any Balder Dash\n\n13:09.320 --> 13:12.280\nor just a movie title.\n\n13:12.280 --> 13:14.800\nIf you at home have one, take a picture of it\n\n13:14.800 --> 13:17.520\nand send it to the Harmontown Twitter.\n\n13:17.520 --> 13:18.080\nWe can play it.\n\n13:18.080 --> 13:20.680\nWe'll play it with our guest when he's like,\n\n13:20.680 --> 13:22.000\nwe can try to figure it out.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.480\nLet's make an action item, OK?\n\n13:24.480 --> 13:28.680\nIf somebody out there in our crowdsourcing community\n\n13:28.680 --> 13:31.200\ncan isolate, let's say, a Balder Dash\n\n13:31.200 --> 13:37.320\ncard such that we can see a question side\n\n13:37.320 --> 13:38.480\nand an answer side for it.\n\n13:38.480 --> 13:40.680\nOnly we can see it, but the crowd can't see it?\n\n13:40.680 --> 13:42.360\nNo, the crowd can see it.\n\n13:42.360 --> 13:43.800\nWe won't be able to see it.\n\n13:43.800 --> 13:44.880\nI got you.\n\n13:44.880 --> 13:47.400\nSo I would say let's just make that an action item\n\n13:47.400 --> 13:52.320\nand then maybe our crew can, if somebody like,\n\n13:52.320 --> 13:54.280\nbecause otherwise I'll just be talking about it all night.\n\n13:54.280 --> 13:56.760\nWell, OK, let's put that out into the ether.\n\n13:56.760 --> 13:59.400\nBut how did you get along with your mom and dad?\n\n13:59.400 --> 14:00.400\nHow did that all go down?\n\n14:00.400 --> 14:01.840\nWas it healing?\n\n14:01.840 --> 14:04.240\nI wouldn't say it was healing, but I would say it was triumphant.\n\n14:04.240 --> 14:06.160\nWe didn't really fight that much.\n\n14:06.160 --> 14:09.240\nLike, I had one flare up with my mom at a restaurant dinner.\n\n14:09.240 --> 14:16.560\nAnd then I, like, steamed and, you know, stewed and, like,\n\n14:16.560 --> 14:20.240\nI didn't, we kind of, that night got lost.\n\n14:20.240 --> 14:22.520\nLike, we didn't, we, like, went to dinner.\n\n14:22.520 --> 14:25.600\nAnd then following that dinner, I went back to the hotel.\n\n14:25.600 --> 14:29.000\nAnd I just kind of fumed into a drink at the hotel bar\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:34.000\nand had Cody, you know, there as my partner.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:35.800\nBut, like, she wasn't, like, taking sides or anything.\n\n14:35.800 --> 14:37.440\nSo it was just, like, I needed, I needed space.\n\n14:37.440 --> 14:38.520\nI needed time.\n\n14:38.520 --> 14:41.360\nAnd then the next morning, it's fine.\n\n14:41.360 --> 14:42.960\nYou know, who wants to keep fighting?\n\n14:42.960 --> 14:43.440\nNobody does.\n\n14:43.440 --> 14:46.560\nDid Cody enjoy your parents?\n\n14:46.560 --> 14:48.040\nYeah, she loves them.\n\n14:48.040 --> 14:49.040\nAnd vice versa.\n\n14:49.040 --> 14:50.560\nShe, yeah, she thinks they're great.\n\n14:50.560 --> 14:52.720\nShe comes from a family where it's like,\n\n14:52.720 --> 14:57.800\nCody has a childhood memory of, or that her,\n\n14:57.800 --> 15:00.640\nit's this thing that her mom would do regularly.\n\n15:00.640 --> 15:03.240\nWhen Cody would take a bath, her mom,\n\n15:03.240 --> 15:07.440\nRandy Heller, Mama LaRusso from the Karate Kid,\n\n15:07.440 --> 15:10.120\nsays not why she's a valuable mother at all.\n\n15:10.120 --> 15:12.600\nBut it arguably gets in the way of a conditional love\n\n15:12.600 --> 15:15.440\nto have a professional actor as a mother.\n\n15:15.440 --> 15:18.240\nIt doesn't hurt to know that your mom was in Karate Kid.\n\n15:18.240 --> 15:20.200\nDoesn't hurt me.\n\n15:20.200 --> 15:24.720\nI mean, I have become functionally a step Karate Kid.\n\n15:24.720 --> 15:27.120\nYou don't, you don't, make no mistake about it.\n\n15:27.120 --> 15:30.120\nThis is part of the package for me.\n\n15:30.120 --> 15:31.880\nI didn't learn unconditional love.\n\n15:31.880 --> 15:33.640\nI'm motivated by other things.\n\n15:33.640 --> 15:35.320\nI love Cody.\n\n15:35.320 --> 15:37.840\nPart of what I love about Cody is that I get to be a step\n\n15:37.840 --> 15:38.760\nKarate Kid.\n\n15:38.760 --> 15:40.400\nAnyways.\n\n15:40.400 --> 15:41.360\nBut no.\n\n15:41.360 --> 15:45.400\nShe was also Rizzo on Broadway in Greece, wasn't she?\n\n15:45.400 --> 15:47.560\nYeah, she was also, I didn't, I, her,\n\n15:47.560 --> 15:51.080\nshe was, most people recognize her on the street\n\n15:51.080 --> 15:53.680\nwhen that happens as her character that she played\n\n15:53.680 --> 15:58.520\na madman, she was Don Draper's secretary for a season.\n\n15:58.520 --> 16:00.520\nShit.\n\n16:00.520 --> 16:03.560\nThis show isn't about fucking Randy Heller, all right?\n\n16:03.560 --> 16:04.680\nIt could be.\n\n16:04.680 --> 16:07.640\nShe's got enough attention.\n\n16:07.640 --> 16:09.600\nBut she was also a loving mother.\n\n16:09.600 --> 16:12.160\nAnd what she would do, like, Cody has this, like,\n\n16:12.160 --> 16:13.760\nit's not even a story, it's not an anecdote,\n\n16:13.760 --> 16:16.000\nit's a tradition that her mom had with Cody.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:17.160\nCody would take a bath.\n\n16:17.160 --> 16:18.640\nAnd then after the bath was done,\n\n16:18.640 --> 16:20.800\nCody would get out of the bath, her mom would,\n\n16:20.800 --> 16:25.800\nwould wrap her up in a big towel and then wrap her up\n\n16:25.800 --> 16:28.680\nin a big blanket, like a comforter.\n\n16:28.680 --> 16:31.960\nAnd then her, and her mom would start dragging her\n\n16:31.960 --> 16:37.360\naround the house inside the comforter saying,\n\n16:37.360 --> 16:40.320\nI got a wild fish here, I got a wild fish.\n\n16:40.320 --> 16:43.360\nAnd she would do this elaborate, like,\n\n16:43.360 --> 16:47.520\nradio play for baby Cody, who was, like,\n\n16:47.520 --> 16:50.880\njust cocooned in this comforter, being dragged around,\n\n16:50.880 --> 16:54.040\nhardwood floors, around an apartment.\n\n16:54.040 --> 16:57.160\nAnd while her mom pretended that she was passing\n\n16:57.160 --> 16:59.880\nvarious checkpoints and lying about whether she\n\n16:59.880 --> 17:04.720\nhad a wild fish with her, so she would do different voices.\n\n17:04.720 --> 17:08.840\nNo, sir, I don't have any wildlife or agriculture\n\n17:08.840 --> 17:12.520\nin my comforter, I just, just a bag and, like,\n\n17:12.520 --> 17:16.000\ntrying to keep her quiet, keep her from giggling.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.800\nLook, this isn't about, let's bag on the Harmons,\n\n17:18.800 --> 17:21.080\nthis is about contrast.\n\n17:21.080 --> 17:23.880\nMy memories are the water would get cold after a while\n\n17:23.880 --> 17:27.960\nand I would find my way out and go roll in pine needles.\n\n17:27.960 --> 17:32.800\nAll right, they're important.\n\n17:32.800 --> 17:35.880\nSo what age did I stop bathing?\n\n17:35.880 --> 17:38.360\nNo.\n\n17:38.360 --> 17:40.320\nI don't know, when was my first bath?\n\n17:40.320 --> 17:43.640\nSo what age did Cody's mom do the wild fish thing?\n\n17:43.640 --> 17:45.800\nLike 15.\n\n17:45.800 --> 17:48.520\n27, yeah.\n\n17:48.520 --> 17:49.800\nWe did it together, she handed it,\n\n17:49.800 --> 17:52.000\nit was like a passing of the baton.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:53.440\nI don't know, I don't know that answer.\n\n17:53.440 --> 17:54.960\nYou and your mom and your dad didn't\n\n17:54.960 --> 17:56.800\nhave any kind of heritage like that?\n\n17:56.800 --> 18:00.320\nLike you didn't have special little fun games?\n\n18:00.320 --> 18:04.840\nHmm, I can't, no.\n\n18:04.840 --> 18:07.520\nRob Sharpe just yelled out Tiki, which was a nickname\n\n18:07.520 --> 18:08.680\nthat I had.\n\n18:08.680 --> 18:09.240\nTiki?\n\n18:09.240 --> 18:10.440\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n18:10.440 --> 18:11.920\nWhy Tiki?\n\n18:11.920 --> 18:14.520\nIt was a favorite childhood story of mine, Tiki, Tiki,\n\n18:14.520 --> 18:16.160\nTimbo.\n\n18:16.160 --> 18:17.240\nOh, man.\n\n18:17.240 --> 18:17.920\nGod damn it.\n\n18:17.920 --> 18:19.960\nWe heard about that on Whiting Longs,\n\n18:19.960 --> 18:21.320\nthe Thanksgiving special.\n\n18:21.320 --> 18:22.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n18:22.040 --> 18:23.920\nWhich you can check out on iTunes.\n\n18:23.920 --> 18:24.560\nYeah.\n\n18:24.560 --> 18:29.840\nI feel like we should bring Rob Sharpe up on stage right now.\n\n18:29.840 --> 18:31.800\nWell, we also have an important guest.\n\n18:31.800 --> 18:34.080\nIt's been a long time coming, because remember,\n\n18:34.080 --> 18:36.880\nsince the election, my goal has been to,\n\n18:36.880 --> 18:40.600\nbecause I don't know what I'm doing, and I have a forum.\n\n18:40.600 --> 18:45.160\nAnd I immediately had reactions that were both predictable,\n\n18:45.160 --> 18:48.200\nunhelpful, and ultimately unguiding.\n\n18:48.200 --> 18:53.360\nI got mad at everybody and bought a gun,\n\n18:53.360 --> 18:55.960\nand have since basically been trying\n\n18:55.960 --> 19:00.200\nto focus on quitting all my jobs and building a Batcave\n\n19:00.200 --> 19:02.120\nwith a crossbow aimed at the door.\n\n19:02.120 --> 19:06.640\nBut in the meantime, I've wanted to use my platform,\n\n19:06.640 --> 19:11.480\nif I could, to signal boost the whole spectrum.\n\n19:11.480 --> 19:16.600\nThe only step I've taken was we flew Gotham Girl out\n\n19:16.600 --> 19:19.760\nfrom New York, and she, I think, I don't know\n\n19:19.760 --> 19:21.280\nif she would want to be called.\n\n19:21.280 --> 19:22.880\nI don't know what label she'd want to be called.\n\n19:22.880 --> 19:25.200\nShe calls herself an Eleanor Democrat in her bio.\n\n19:25.200 --> 19:30.560\nShe talked about, you know, it's important.\n\n19:30.560 --> 19:33.840\nIt was important to hear from an intelligent person's\n\n19:33.840 --> 19:37.520\nperspective, like, basically, don't give up on what we would\n\n19:37.520 --> 19:39.000\ncall the old Democratic Party.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:42.360\nYou know, let's hack it the way that the Nazis have hacked\n\n19:42.360 --> 19:45.040\nthe right wing, the Republican Party.\n\n19:45.040 --> 19:48.200\nI mean, they infiltrated it, took it over,\n\n19:48.200 --> 19:52.880\nand now the word Republican means I want to win.\n\n19:52.880 --> 19:54.560\nIt didn't mean much before that, but it's like,\n\n19:54.560 --> 19:56.600\nand I think the idea is, like, come on,\n\n19:56.600 --> 20:01.360\nwe can still use this shell of a Democratic Party, hack it,\n\n20:01.360 --> 20:03.920\ndrive it from the inside, because it has the numbers\n\n20:03.920 --> 20:07.360\nand the systemic advantage that it's the only thing that\n\n20:07.360 --> 20:10.320\ncan rock and sock them, that robot.\n\n20:10.320 --> 20:12.360\nSo now let's hear, maybe, I would assume,\n\n20:12.360 --> 20:14.800\nmaybe another perspective, but I want to definitely\n\n20:14.800 --> 20:17.920\nbe clear that this, we wanted to have somebody from the DSA\n\n20:17.920 --> 20:20.240\non, the Democratic Socialists of America,\n\n20:20.240 --> 20:25.080\nand, but we, this is a guy who's a member of them.\n\n20:25.080 --> 20:27.720\nHe's not a, he doesn't represent them as a leader\n\n20:27.720 --> 20:29.240\nor anything, he's not a spokesman.\n\n20:29.240 --> 20:31.520\nHe's already, we'll talk about how he's already,\n\n20:31.520 --> 20:34.880\nhe resigned from his position as an official spokesman\n\n20:34.880 --> 20:39.800\nbecause of a little, like, a little gridlock,\n\n20:39.800 --> 20:42.640\nlittle cultural gridlock, comedic cultural gridlock\n\n20:42.640 --> 20:44.480\nthat happened where he did the smart thing\n\n20:44.480 --> 20:46.520\nand, like, backed out as being a representative.\n\n20:46.520 --> 20:49.320\nSo, but, what he is, is a guy who understands\n\n20:49.320 --> 20:51.040\nthat perspective, which I think is different\n\n20:51.040 --> 20:52.280\nfrom the other one that we've gotten.\n\n20:52.280 --> 20:55.760\nAnd we tried, we tried to get the official spokesperson\n\n20:55.760 --> 20:59.600\nofficially sanctioned by a local chapter of the DSA,\n\n20:59.600 --> 21:02.360\nand we tried for multiple months,\n\n21:02.360 --> 21:05.240\nI want to say four or five in total,\n\n21:05.240 --> 21:07.960\nand then we took matters into our own hands\n\n21:07.960 --> 21:09.560\nand just were like, hey, this guy,\n\n21:09.560 --> 21:11.960\nI think he knows something, let's get him.\n\n21:11.960 --> 21:14.160\nLike the socialist activists that we are,\n\n21:14.160 --> 21:15.360\nwe took matters in our own hands.\n\n21:15.360 --> 21:17.120\nBut I don't know whose fault that is.\n\n21:17.120 --> 21:17.960\nThat could be-\n\n21:17.960 --> 21:19.880\nIt's their fault, and if they want to be taken seriously\n\n21:19.880 --> 21:23.240\nas a political group, they should get on their shit.\n\n21:23.240 --> 21:24.880\nDo we know for sure that Levy isn't secretly-\n\n21:24.880 --> 21:26.360\nI'm going to take that stand.\n\n21:26.360 --> 21:29.560\nWell, I'll take that stand and I'll take the stand\n\n21:29.560 --> 21:32.560\nthat Steve has been cock-blocking them from day one\n\n21:32.560 --> 21:36.040\nas the alt-right subversive insurgent that he is.\n\n21:36.040 --> 21:37.040\nOkay, good.\n\n21:37.040 --> 21:44.560\nWell, let's bring up our new friend, Josh Androwski.\n\n21:44.560 --> 21:47.400\nOh, yeah.\n\n21:47.400 --> 21:49.720\nHe's got two cans.\n\n21:54.480 --> 21:55.400\nHi.\n\n21:55.400 --> 21:56.120\nHello, Josh.\n\n21:56.120 --> 21:56.400\nHow are you?\n\n21:56.400 --> 21:57.320\nHow are you?\n\n21:57.320 --> 21:58.080\nGood to see you.\n\n21:58.080 --> 22:00.760\nNow I feel bad I didn't shake Spencer's hand.\n\n22:00.760 --> 22:01.960\nYou got some lacrosse there?\n\n22:01.960 --> 22:02.720\nYeah, I do.\n\n22:02.720 --> 22:03.720\nI guess to me, we are.\n\n22:03.720 --> 22:04.680\nYeah.\n\n22:04.680 --> 22:06.640\nYou came up double fisting some lacrosse.\n\n22:06.640 --> 22:09.760\nI quit drinking, and I know this podcast well enough\n\n22:09.760 --> 22:13.080\nto know that there would be no non-alcoholic beverages.\n\n22:13.080 --> 22:15.520\nRight, just like Dino's party.\n\n22:15.520 --> 22:18.280\nIt's taking matters into your own hands.\n\n22:18.280 --> 22:21.240\nSpencer did the, I don't know if he did it out of fashion\n\n22:21.240 --> 22:25.320\nor climate control, but you walked in\n\n22:25.320 --> 22:28.400\nand you were wearing the same shirt.\n\n22:28.400 --> 22:33.080\nSocialists prove that white people do have culture.\n\n22:33.080 --> 22:35.160\nI thought you were just going to say socialist dressed\n\n22:35.160 --> 22:35.960\nlike Spencer.\n\n22:35.960 --> 22:36.760\nYeah, no, we do.\n\n22:36.760 --> 22:38.200\nWe all like.\n\n22:38.200 --> 22:40.280\nThat's the subtext.\n\n22:40.280 --> 22:46.400\nSo people can Google and they can Wikipedia and stuff.\n\n22:46.400 --> 22:49.840\nI Wikipediaed and Googled for the 11-minute drive\n\n22:49.840 --> 22:53.400\nfrom Los Feliz to Burbank.\n\n22:53.400 --> 22:57.440\nHere's what you can learn by reading and scrolling.\n\n22:57.440 --> 23:01.920\nThe DSA was once a part of the IS, the International\n\n23:01.920 --> 23:03.920\nSocialist, or Socialist International\n\n23:03.920 --> 23:05.840\nSI, Sports Illustrated.\n\n23:05.840 --> 23:08.200\nThey were both Sports Illustrated.\n\n23:08.200 --> 23:11.640\nOur swimsuit issue was really revolutionary.\n\n23:11.640 --> 23:14.120\nWe had one swimsuit for all the models.\n\n23:14.120 --> 23:16.160\nIt was Betty Friedan wearing a burka.\n\n23:16.160 --> 23:17.120\nYeah, it was.\n\n23:17.120 --> 23:18.240\nThey're all wearing gas masks.\n\n23:18.240 --> 23:19.880\nIt was Frida Kahlo designed it.\n\n23:19.880 --> 23:21.920\nIt was incredible.\n\n23:21.920 --> 23:24.880\nBut there was a split in 82.\n\n23:24.880 --> 23:28.480\nWe now call the DSA voted to extricate themselves\n\n23:28.480 --> 23:31.800\nfrom the larger global socialists.\n\n23:31.800 --> 23:35.760\nBasically, none of that shit matters at all.\n\n23:35.760 --> 23:39.080\nThe history and what I mean to say is, I don't know.\n\n23:39.080 --> 23:39.560\nOh, OK.\n\n23:39.560 --> 23:43.480\nBecause the DSA fundamentally transformed\n\n23:43.480 --> 23:44.640\nduring the last election.\n\n23:44.640 --> 23:46.640\nRight, it's now what it is.\n\n23:46.640 --> 23:48.400\nBut it's important to note, for instance,\n\n23:48.400 --> 23:50.440\nthat it's not a political party, right?\n\n23:50.440 --> 23:50.800\nNo.\n\n23:50.800 --> 23:53.040\nYou don't have a candidate.\n\n23:53.040 --> 23:55.200\nRight, so we're not a political party in the sense\n\n23:55.200 --> 23:56.800\nthat we're not going to fall.\n\n23:56.800 --> 23:59.600\nAnd hopefully, this is what people have worked towards.\n\n23:59.600 --> 24:01.880\nAnd my friends and myself have worked towards.\n\n24:01.880 --> 24:04.680\nWe don't want to fall into the trapping of the Green Party,\n\n24:04.680 --> 24:08.960\nwhere you just every four years trot out somebody that\n\n24:08.960 --> 24:13.000\nis like whatever, just a person, good or bad.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.080\nAnd then it's like every four years, you're like, hey,\n\n24:15.080 --> 24:17.560\nlet's change everything from the president down.\n\n24:17.560 --> 24:19.560\nBecause nobody knows who the fuck we are.\n\n24:19.560 --> 24:20.280\nExactly.\n\n24:20.280 --> 24:21.720\nWell, also, it just falls apart.\n\n24:21.720 --> 24:24.560\nLike, you just can't.\n\n24:24.560 --> 24:27.600\nIf we have a problem with the way the system has been run,\n\n24:27.600 --> 24:30.200\npart of the problem is that there's just some knucklehead\n\n24:30.200 --> 24:33.600\nwho supposedly is supposed to not offend everybody every minute\n\n24:33.600 --> 24:34.120\nof every day.\n\n24:34.120 --> 24:37.680\nAnd supposedly that the president,\n\n24:37.680 --> 24:40.400\nI think Donald Trump has proven more than anything\n\n24:40.400 --> 24:42.760\nthat the president doesn't really do that much,\n\n24:42.760 --> 24:47.000\nthat the president is more of a figurehead right now.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:47.840\nHe certainly can't.\n\n24:47.840 --> 24:49.360\nWhat we do know about that office\n\n24:49.360 --> 24:52.520\nis that you can't blow up the world from it\n\n24:52.520 --> 24:54.600\nwithin less than a year.\n\n24:54.600 --> 24:55.760\nRight, which like.\n\n24:55.760 --> 24:58.200\nMakes it relatively less powerful than, let's say,\n\n24:58.200 --> 24:59.400\nthe head of Al-Qaeda.\n\n24:59.400 --> 25:04.480\nYeah, or a general, like an unelected person\n\n25:04.480 --> 25:06.120\nin our government.\n\n25:06.120 --> 25:10.560\nAnd so what we have done as far as the idea of like,\n\n25:10.560 --> 25:14.080\nare we a political party or not, in local elections,\n\n25:14.080 --> 25:15.240\nthat's where we're focusing.\n\n25:15.240 --> 25:19.960\nWe truly think, you were talking about how it's like the big\n\n25:19.960 --> 25:22.560\nrobot fight, like the Pacific Rim between the Democrats\n\n25:22.560 --> 25:24.040\nand the Republicans or whatever.\n\n25:24.040 --> 25:27.200\nWe're the little land speeders tying their likes together,\n\n25:27.200 --> 25:27.760\nyou know?\n\n25:27.760 --> 25:30.720\nLike, if.\n\n25:30.720 --> 25:31.220\nYes.\n\n25:31.220 --> 25:32.640\nThis is Rob Schrab.\n\n25:32.640 --> 25:33.560\nSnow speeder.\n\n25:33.560 --> 25:35.000\nWe're the little snow speeders, fuck.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:35.760\nI ruined it.\n\n25:35.760 --> 25:37.320\nNobody likes the GSA anymore, because I\n\n25:37.320 --> 25:39.280\nfucked up a Star Wars reference.\n\n25:39.280 --> 25:41.960\nThis is bad.\n\n25:41.960 --> 25:43.960\nNo, no, I don't think that's what.\n\n25:43.960 --> 25:46.880\nOh, you said, oh, he said land speeders and you're correcting him.\n\n25:46.880 --> 25:48.720\nWow, I'm catching up.\n\n25:48.720 --> 25:49.840\nJesus Christ.\n\n25:49.840 --> 25:52.520\nSchrab, by the way, is that little black box\n\n25:52.520 --> 25:55.480\nthat Chewbacca scared on the Death Star?\n\n25:55.480 --> 25:57.040\nOnly there's no Chewbacca's here.\n\n25:57.040 --> 25:59.600\nWhat was the whole Death Star out of the black box?\n\n25:59.600 --> 26:03.240\nWhat was the name of that little droid?\n\n26:03.240 --> 26:04.960\nI'm guessing you're asking, because you know.\n\n26:04.960 --> 26:05.560\nI don't know.\n\n26:05.560 --> 26:06.920\nOh.\n\n26:06.920 --> 26:07.600\nOh, wow.\n\n26:07.600 --> 26:11.840\nIt's 4, 20, 69.\n\n26:11.840 --> 26:15.240\n4, 20, 69, but I can never forget.\n\n26:15.240 --> 26:19.000\nAll right, but yeah, but that's important to know,\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:22.120\nbecause right away, to me, it's like, because I mean,\n\n26:22.120 --> 26:25.880\nyou backed, I'm saying you, like you're this whole group,\n\n26:25.880 --> 26:30.720\nbut you pick a candidate in these big fights.\n\n26:30.720 --> 26:34.240\nSure, well, traditionally no, but in this last election,\n\n26:34.240 --> 26:38.800\nyes, with Bernie, because Bernie was the only candidate that\n\n26:38.800 --> 26:45.320\nwas left of the centrist opinion who actually had a shot.\n\n26:45.320 --> 26:47.840\nAnd so I wasn't with them during that period,\n\n26:47.840 --> 26:51.960\nbut I know that they were like, hey, let's backburn.\n\n26:51.960 --> 26:55.200\nBut for me, and the way that I got into the DSA\n\n26:55.200 --> 26:58.600\nis I was sick and tired.\n\n26:58.600 --> 27:01.200\nI was always the guy when the bad shit would happen,\n\n27:01.200 --> 27:03.120\nthat I would be the first guy out to protest.\n\n27:03.120 --> 27:05.400\nI would be the first person out to do a benefit show\n\n27:05.400 --> 27:06.480\nabout the bad thing.\n\n27:06.480 --> 27:10.080\nAnd I was sick and tired of reacting to all the bad shit.\n\n27:10.080 --> 27:12.600\nAnd I was like, well, how do you stop the bad shit\n\n27:12.600 --> 27:13.760\nfrom happening?\n\n27:13.760 --> 27:16.320\nAnd I thought, I'm one guy.\n\n27:16.320 --> 27:18.280\nI'm not a billionaire.\n\n27:18.280 --> 27:20.800\nAnd I'm not like Timothy Comcast with access\n\n27:20.800 --> 27:22.440\nto all the resources in the world.\n\n27:22.440 --> 27:23.400\nThat little prick.\n\n27:23.400 --> 27:24.760\nYeah, fucking Timothy Comcast.\n\n27:24.760 --> 27:27.680\nHas not earned his position as CEO of Comcast at all.\n\n27:27.680 --> 27:28.180\nObviously.\n\n27:28.180 --> 27:29.080\nClearly nepotism.\n\n27:29.080 --> 27:29.520\nOh, clearly.\n\n27:29.520 --> 27:31.360\nI mean, there's no way that's a coincidence.\n\n27:31.360 --> 27:32.040\nNo.\n\n27:32.040 --> 27:33.840\nNo, I know he says he spells it with a K,\n\n27:33.840 --> 27:35.320\nbut we all know he's fucking talking.\n\n27:35.320 --> 27:38.080\nHe looks just like his dad.\n\n27:38.080 --> 27:40.560\nHe's got the antenna and the blinking light on his forehead.\n\n27:40.560 --> 27:42.240\nYeah.\n\n27:42.240 --> 27:47.160\nSo I saw that the DSA was doing stuff locally.\n\n27:47.160 --> 27:51.080\nAnd the idea that we all fight in all these similar battles.\n\n27:51.080 --> 27:53.160\nEverybody's fighting for better housing,\n\n27:53.160 --> 27:57.680\nfor better medicine to treat oppressed groups,\n\n27:57.680 --> 27:58.920\nlike human beings.\n\n27:58.920 --> 28:02.600\nWe all have these fights locally within our own communities.\n\n28:02.600 --> 28:06.240\nAnd so if every city bands together\n\n28:06.240 --> 28:10.400\nand topples their local Trump, then that\n\n28:10.400 --> 28:12.240\nwill lead to a domino effect.\n\n28:12.240 --> 28:14.400\nBecause there's Trumps everywhere.\n\n28:14.400 --> 28:17.040\nAnd oftentimes, they're way funnier and crazier\n\n28:17.040 --> 28:17.960\nthan the actual Trump.\n\n28:17.960 --> 28:20.440\nBecause they don't think anyone's looking at them.\n\n28:20.440 --> 28:21.920\nAnd so it's all about.\n\n28:21.920 --> 28:24.280\nThat's like probably local wrestling franchises\n\n28:24.280 --> 28:27.200\nare like way more crazy than WCW or whatever.\n\n28:27.200 --> 28:29.040\nYeah, like the ECW, where they were just.\n\n28:29.040 --> 28:31.800\nIs that guy really staring to the sun, man?\n\n28:31.800 --> 28:33.840\nIs that guy dancing queen?\n\n28:33.840 --> 28:35.640\nHe's the Abba-themed wrestler?\n\n28:35.640 --> 28:36.840\nThe outlet forker.\n\n28:36.840 --> 28:38.160\nThis seems irresponsible.\n\n28:38.160 --> 28:39.880\nBut that's District 12.\n\n28:39.880 --> 28:42.680\nWatch out for running with scissors, man.\n\n28:42.680 --> 28:44.280\nHey, kids, running out there.\n\n28:44.280 --> 28:45.120\nGrab those scissors.\n\n28:45.120 --> 28:46.360\nLeft-handed, right-handed.\n\n28:46.360 --> 28:47.080\nRun with them.\n\n28:47.080 --> 28:48.040\nYou've got to run free.\n\n28:48.040 --> 28:49.720\nDon't let people make you walk with scissors.\n\n28:49.720 --> 28:50.760\nYou've got to stare in the sun.\n\n28:50.760 --> 28:52.280\nYou've got to put those scissors in an outlet.\n\n28:52.280 --> 28:53.560\nHua!\n\n28:53.560 --> 28:55.440\nAnd his catchphrase is Hua?\n\n28:55.440 --> 28:56.960\nThat's actually his entire catchphrase.\n\n28:56.960 --> 28:58.600\nHe says that every time.\n\n28:58.600 --> 29:01.200\nWell, he's army.\n\n29:01.200 --> 29:03.920\nYeah, or he's scent of a woman derivative.\n\n29:03.920 --> 29:05.440\nYeah, it is Pacino.\n\n29:05.440 --> 29:07.520\nThat's Pacino's latest role as running with scissors.\n\n29:07.520 --> 29:11.200\nMan, he has just become a caricature of himself.\n\n29:11.200 --> 29:11.920\nOh, god.\n\n29:11.920 --> 29:13.040\nOh, Hua.\n\n29:13.040 --> 29:14.440\nDiggity dog.\n\n29:14.440 --> 29:16.440\nI don't know. Just want to talk.\n\n29:16.440 --> 29:17.040\nDiggity dog?\n\n29:17.040 --> 29:17.840\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n29:17.840 --> 29:18.920\nDid he say that in dog day afternoon?\n\n29:18.920 --> 29:19.920\nYeah, probably.\n\n29:19.920 --> 29:20.480\nDiggity dog.\n\n29:20.480 --> 29:21.960\nI want my ransom.\n\n29:21.960 --> 29:23.440\nI want my trans lover.\n\n29:23.440 --> 29:25.200\nI want to talk to a negotiator.\n\n29:25.200 --> 29:25.840\nDiggity dog.\n\n29:25.840 --> 29:26.640\nDog day.\n\n29:26.640 --> 29:28.920\nWe've got a dog day here.\n\n29:28.920 --> 29:29.440\nHot cha cha cha.\n\n29:29.440 --> 29:30.240\nDog deletion.\n\n29:30.240 --> 29:32.840\nI told you about the time I peed next to him at the restaurant.\n\n29:32.840 --> 29:34.280\nAnd he had headphones on.\n\n29:34.280 --> 29:37.520\nAnd he was, I think, learning lions.\n\n29:37.520 --> 29:38.840\nI peeing next to a chain.\n\n29:38.840 --> 29:44.400\nHe's like, hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n29:44.400 --> 29:47.880\nAs it's coming out, is that the reaction to the,\n\n29:47.880 --> 29:49.040\nwas it a good peeing?\n\n29:49.040 --> 29:50.480\nI think he was learning lions.\n\n29:50.480 --> 29:53.280\nHe had little earbuds in.\n\n29:53.280 --> 29:57.240\nAnd he, I don't know.\n\n29:57.240 --> 30:00.000\nThis is part of the explanation for what Pacino became\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.400\nas an icon, like it's that he started\n\n30:02.400 --> 30:03.760\nrunning lions at the urinals.\n\n30:03.760 --> 30:05.520\nSo he's suffering from piss shiver\n\n30:05.520 --> 30:07.200\nwhile he's committing these lines.\n\n30:07.200 --> 30:10.800\nLike he, you know, it's funny you mentioned that, Dan,\n\n30:10.800 --> 30:12.600\ntonight's show has been brought to you by piss shiver.\n\n30:12.600 --> 30:13.520\nPiss shiver.\n\n30:13.520 --> 30:15.280\nIs your body filled with the warmth\n\n30:15.280 --> 30:21.080\nof having body temperature urine in its bladder?\n\n30:21.080 --> 30:23.720\nAs it rapidly exits, don't just shiver.\n\n30:23.720 --> 30:25.440\nPiss shiver when you're at the urinal\n\n30:25.440 --> 30:27.200\nand can't explain why you're suddenly shuddering.\n\n30:27.200 --> 30:29.480\nHey, look down here.\n\n30:29.480 --> 30:31.040\nIt's me.\n\n30:31.040 --> 30:32.960\nYour dick.\n\n30:32.960 --> 30:37.040\nI sure have been shivering a lot while I've been pissing.\n\n30:37.040 --> 30:39.880\nYou know, I ain't just an enlarged form of clitoris\n\n30:39.880 --> 30:42.040\nthat was mutated when your species decided\n\n30:42.040 --> 30:46.200\nto become sexually reproductive instead of asexual.\n\n30:46.200 --> 30:48.280\nThat was just a thank you, ladies.\n\n30:48.280 --> 30:48.880\nCan we?\n\n30:48.880 --> 30:51.680\nIs there a way to reverse angle on Rob Schrab\n\n30:51.680 --> 30:53.200\nwith his feet on the stage?\n\n30:53.200 --> 30:55.280\nHe's so clearly.\n\n30:55.280 --> 30:59.160\nYou look like you're about to rap battle at an office.\n\n30:59.160 --> 31:01.640\nWell, why don't we bring him up now that we're comfortable\n\n31:01.640 --> 31:02.600\nand you're not?\n\n31:02.600 --> 31:03.760\nDo we have enough mics?\n\n31:03.760 --> 31:05.200\nIt doesn't look like there's any.\n\n31:05.200 --> 31:06.160\nOh, I didn't see that one.\n\n31:06.160 --> 31:07.520\nSorry, everybody.\n\n31:07.520 --> 31:11.680\nRob Schrab to the stage.\n\n31:11.680 --> 31:12.800\nWe can't control you.\n\n31:12.800 --> 31:13.800\nYou can't control us.\n\n31:17.800 --> 31:22.440\nLook, largely lifting himself from the seat.\n\n31:22.440 --> 31:25.400\nHe sits and pulls his legs up on the stage.\n\n31:25.400 --> 31:25.900\nYeah!\n\n31:31.160 --> 31:33.120\nSauntering to the chair.\n\n31:33.120 --> 31:38.000\nHe gestures lazily at the microphone and cup.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:38.600\nHello?\n\n31:38.600 --> 31:40.760\nHe stands.\n\n31:40.760 --> 31:41.760\nHi, Rob.\n\n31:41.760 --> 31:43.040\nHi.\n\n31:43.040 --> 31:43.680\nHow are you?\n\n31:43.680 --> 31:44.920\nI'm OK.\n\n31:44.920 --> 31:46.320\nWhat are you up to, Rob?\n\n31:46.320 --> 31:47.960\nHow was your Thanksgiving?\n\n31:47.960 --> 31:48.520\nIt was good.\n\n31:48.520 --> 31:56.560\nI went to Topanga and spent it with Kate's parents and family.\n\n31:56.560 --> 31:58.080\nDid they enjoy you?\n\n31:58.080 --> 31:58.560\nI think so.\n\n31:58.560 --> 31:59.800\nDid they like their Rob Schrab?\n\n31:59.800 --> 32:01.120\nI think so.\n\n32:01.120 --> 32:04.120\nI was cutting it up during dinner.\n\n32:04.120 --> 32:08.360\nDo you remember any bone mozz that you fucking threw out?\n\n32:08.360 --> 32:09.000\nBone mozz.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.360\nTop three bone mozz.\n\n32:10.360 --> 32:11.080\nBone mozz?\n\n32:11.080 --> 32:11.760\nBone mozz?\n\n32:11.760 --> 32:13.160\nNumber one.\n\n32:13.160 --> 32:13.920\nNumber three.\n\n32:13.920 --> 32:14.800\nBone mozz.\n\n32:14.800 --> 32:16.120\nI don't know what that word is.\n\n32:16.120 --> 32:16.920\nBone mozz.\n\n32:16.920 --> 32:18.280\nBone mozz.\n\n32:18.280 --> 32:19.280\nAnd any zinger.\n\n32:19.280 --> 32:20.160\nI still don't know.\n\n32:20.160 --> 32:21.600\nIt doesn't matter how you pronounce it.\n\n32:21.600 --> 32:25.120\nAny fun little sugar coated fucking zinger.\n\n32:25.120 --> 32:26.080\nI don't really remember.\n\n32:26.080 --> 32:29.680\nI was just a lot of just me being an idiot.\n\n32:29.680 --> 32:31.040\nI don't really have any.\n\n32:31.040 --> 32:32.080\nWhat's your secret, Rob?\n\n32:32.080 --> 32:33.440\nWould you go into a room?\n\n32:33.440 --> 32:35.120\nI just say things.\n\n32:35.120 --> 32:35.840\nThat's mine.\n\n32:35.840 --> 32:38.280\nWhen you're in a room full of strangers,\n\n32:38.280 --> 32:41.080\nif you could give people out there any advice,\n\n32:41.080 --> 32:44.520\nwhat would be your advice to somebody\n\n32:44.520 --> 32:46.840\ngoing into a room full of strangers\n\n32:46.840 --> 32:48.720\nand how to win them over?\n\n32:48.720 --> 32:49.280\nOh, god.\n\n32:49.280 --> 32:49.960\nI don't know.\n\n32:49.960 --> 32:53.720\nIn a social or a professional setting?\n\n32:53.720 --> 32:58.720\nLet's just say at a social setting, like Thanksgiving.\n\n32:58.720 --> 33:00.480\nI don't know how I would.\n\n33:00.480 --> 33:02.880\nI don't think I've ever won anybody over.\n\n33:02.880 --> 33:04.800\nWell, I'll take some time with that question.\n\n33:04.800 --> 33:07.040\nAnd then the format of the show will\n\n33:07.040 --> 33:10.720\nswivel back over to talking about the DSA.\n\n33:10.720 --> 33:15.120\nAnd then when we come back to Schrab,\n\n33:15.120 --> 33:17.520\nwe're going to learn his secret for when he enters a room.\n\n33:17.520 --> 33:19.120\nWe're going to find out your secret.\n\n33:19.120 --> 33:20.320\nWe're going to find out your secret.\n\n33:20.320 --> 33:21.920\nI don't want to monetize it, dude.\n\n33:21.920 --> 33:23.560\nJust think about it for what?\n\n33:23.560 --> 33:24.960\nHe doesn't have to monetize it.\n\n33:24.960 --> 33:26.320\nHe just has to win.\n\n33:26.320 --> 33:27.800\nJust think about it for five minutes.\n\n33:27.800 --> 33:30.320\nI'm going to talk to Josh Andraski from the DSA.\n\n33:30.320 --> 33:32.760\nAnd then you think about your secret, Rob.\n\n33:32.760 --> 33:34.320\nYour secret.\n\n33:34.320 --> 33:35.680\nI'm not making this to hear.\n\n33:35.680 --> 33:38.960\nEverybody wants to listen to me be a fake interviewer\n\n33:38.960 --> 33:40.960\nor know about power.\n\n33:40.960 --> 33:42.160\nI'm saying, let's blend this.\n\n33:42.160 --> 33:42.720\nThis is good.\n\n33:42.720 --> 33:43.960\nIt's like a parfait.\n\n33:43.960 --> 33:46.360\nSo just think about the answer to that question.\n\n33:46.360 --> 33:48.040\nWhat's your secret?\n\n33:48.040 --> 33:52.760\nJosh, we can't really talk about the Democratic Party\n\n33:52.760 --> 33:56.320\nor the remnants thereof without talking about this new word\n\n33:56.320 --> 33:58.120\nthat I learned, neoliberalism.\n\n33:58.120 --> 34:00.160\nAh, yes, neoliberalism.\n\n34:00.160 --> 34:07.600\nNeoliberalism is basically socially liberal but not\n\n34:07.600 --> 34:08.840\nbut fiscally conservative.\n\n34:08.840 --> 34:11.080\nAnd as somebody who's generally corporate.\n\n34:11.080 --> 34:11.600\nRight.\n\n34:11.600 --> 34:13.760\nAnd I forget who tweeted this.\n\n34:13.760 --> 34:15.560\nIt's one of my favorite tweets.\n\n34:15.560 --> 34:18.160\nI'm socially liberal but fiscally conservative.\n\n34:18.160 --> 34:21.400\nI hate the problems, but I love their causes.\n\n34:21.400 --> 34:23.800\nAnd that's really what it is.\n\n34:23.800 --> 34:27.680\nAnd somebody else tweeted, the platonic ideal of neoliberalism\n\n34:27.680 --> 34:30.080\nis to have racial and gender balance\n\n34:30.080 --> 34:31.720\non the board of a drone company.\n\n34:31.720 --> 34:32.480\nRight.\n\n34:32.480 --> 34:35.120\nIt's like this hollow identity politics, something\n\n34:35.120 --> 34:39.480\nlike Los Angeles' district attorney is a woman of color.\n\n34:39.480 --> 34:42.400\nAnd you think that's a victory to have a black woman in such\n\n34:42.400 --> 34:44.800\nlike a big position of power.\n\n34:44.800 --> 34:45.600\nAnd it is.\n\n34:45.600 --> 34:49.840\nHowever, she has not persecuted any murderous policeman\n\n34:49.840 --> 34:51.560\nin her entire tenure.\n\n34:51.560 --> 34:54.640\nAnd so something like that would be an example\n\n34:54.640 --> 34:56.960\nof that's probably neoliberalism in action.\n\n34:56.960 --> 35:00.480\nIt's somebody who doesn't want to upset the status quo,\n\n35:00.480 --> 35:05.000\nwho still wants the ultra-wealthy to be as rich as possible\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.120\nand the rest of us to be fighting for crumbs.\n\n35:07.120 --> 35:08.960\nBut it's the thing that was working yesterday,\n\n35:08.960 --> 35:12.280\nwhich I have found in my exploration of white fragility.\n\n35:12.280 --> 35:13.560\nI went and bought a gun.\n\n35:13.560 --> 35:15.960\nThat's a classic neoliberal move, I would say.\n\n35:15.960 --> 35:17.600\nI mean, it's just a classic white dude move.\n\n35:17.600 --> 35:19.640\nThat's a classic scared white guy move is to buy.\n\n35:19.640 --> 35:21.120\nIt's the scared white guy move.\n\n35:21.120 --> 35:24.840\nAnd my therapist would say, who's the gun for?\n\n35:24.840 --> 35:27.840\nBut she's my therapist, so I didn't realize until 10 minutes\n\n35:27.840 --> 35:31.520\nin the conversation, she's asking, is it for you?\n\n35:31.520 --> 35:34.600\nBecause Hunter S. Thompson bought one at one point,\n\n35:34.600 --> 35:36.000\ndidn't buy it for himself.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nAnd I would like thank you for that equation.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.520\nAnd he's famous.\n\n35:40.520 --> 35:41.040\nMore important.\n\n35:41.040 --> 35:44.000\nBlowing his brains out and letting his daughter find them.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:45.640\nGreat suicide note, though.\n\n35:45.640 --> 35:48.040\nFootball season's over.\n\n35:48.040 --> 35:53.000\nBut it was because it was the appeal, the billboard,\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:54.560\nfor neoliberalism now.\n\n35:54.560 --> 35:57.480\nI think I've been a spokesman for it in my behavior.\n\n35:57.480 --> 36:00.520\nAnd if I just put my thumb in my mouth\n\n36:00.520 --> 36:02.600\nand just say what I'm really feeling\n\n36:02.600 --> 36:08.800\nwithout Kool-Aid plunging into some cause that's\n\n36:08.800 --> 36:11.320\ngoing to not benefit me, ultimately,\n\n36:11.320 --> 36:13.680\nor in any immediate way that I can feel,\n\n36:13.680 --> 36:16.480\nif I just follow my comfort, I am a neoliberal.\n\n36:16.480 --> 36:18.000\nI want my Obama back.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.560\nI want my Obama back.\n\n36:20.560 --> 36:21.280\nRight.\n\n36:21.280 --> 36:26.040\nAnd that is something that people need to.\n\n36:26.040 --> 36:30.160\nI want you to have committed more to your Obama back.\n\n36:30.160 --> 36:31.600\nWell, there's an extra syllable in there.\n\n36:31.600 --> 36:34.920\nI want my Obama back, Obama back, Obama back, Obama back.\n\n36:34.920 --> 36:35.640\nThere's got to be.\n\n36:35.640 --> 36:37.280\nSomebody has done that.\n\n36:37.280 --> 36:38.480\nCome on.\n\n36:38.480 --> 36:43.800\nTechnocratic, bureaucratic, Obama back.\n\n36:43.800 --> 36:44.880\nIt's like the West Wing was real.\n\n36:44.880 --> 36:46.000\nIt's not a thing, because then there's\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.160\nribs and then that's an unfortunate cultural connotation\n\n36:48.160 --> 36:50.160\nthat we don't want to step into.\n\n36:50.160 --> 36:51.640\nBut you did a really good job of avoiding it\n\n36:51.640 --> 36:53.480\nuntil you mentioned that you avoided it.\n\n36:53.480 --> 36:53.960\nRight.\n\n36:53.960 --> 36:54.200\nI know.\n\n36:54.200 --> 36:54.840\nWell, that's me.\n\n36:54.840 --> 36:56.320\nThat's classic Harmon.\n\n36:56.320 --> 36:57.200\nHey, everybody, look.\n\n36:57.200 --> 37:01.040\nI'm not racist, because I wasn't thinking about this.\n\n37:01.040 --> 37:02.040\nSchrab, all right.\n\n37:02.040 --> 37:03.760\nWhat's your secret?\n\n37:03.760 --> 37:06.280\nNo excuse.\n\n37:06.280 --> 37:07.520\nHow are you cutting it up?\n\n37:07.520 --> 37:08.720\nHow am I cutting it up?\n\n37:08.720 --> 37:09.200\nI don't know.\n\n37:09.200 --> 37:11.080\nI was just being an idiot.\n\n37:11.080 --> 37:14.760\nThere was two children there and there at that age\n\n37:14.760 --> 37:19.920\nthat they just are laughing at any attention.\n\n37:19.920 --> 37:28.520\nI think like four and six.\n\n37:28.520 --> 37:30.360\nThose are good social ages.\n\n37:30.360 --> 37:32.080\nI like the fours and the sixes.\n\n37:32.080 --> 37:33.360\nYeah, I guess.\n\n37:33.360 --> 37:35.920\nYeah, I'm just goofing off.\n\n37:35.920 --> 37:38.600\nBecause they're verbal, but they're inquisitive,\n\n37:38.600 --> 37:44.120\nand if you talk to them like a grownup, they're pretty fun.\n\n37:44.120 --> 37:46.600\nYeah.\n\n37:46.600 --> 37:47.680\nNot to pry.\n\n37:47.680 --> 37:50.000\nThis could go into personal stuff with you and Kate,\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.080\nwho I married.\n\n37:52.080 --> 37:53.280\nYou married Kate?\n\n37:53.280 --> 37:55.960\nI officiated your marriage to her.\n\n37:55.960 --> 37:57.520\nYou guys had no plans to have children,\n\n37:57.520 --> 37:58.920\nwhich is why you didn't bother getting married.\n\n37:58.920 --> 38:00.720\nI was the MC at that wedding.\n\n38:00.720 --> 38:01.800\nIs there any change there?\n\n38:01.800 --> 38:03.240\nIs there any capacity for change?\n\n38:03.240 --> 38:04.600\nDo the two of you ever talk about it?\n\n38:04.600 --> 38:05.600\nNo.\n\n38:05.600 --> 38:06.100\nNo.\n\n38:06.100 --> 38:08.400\nYou've just resolved no kids, like you're both totally.\n\n38:08.400 --> 38:12.560\nI think it's come up.\n\n38:12.560 --> 38:17.640\nKate just is not interested, and I'm fine with that.\n\n38:17.640 --> 38:20.360\nI don't really.\n\n38:20.360 --> 38:21.520\nThere's other people's kids.\n\n38:21.520 --> 38:24.080\nYeah, I mean, there's other people's kids.\n\n38:24.080 --> 38:29.080\nMy biggest thing about children is parents.\n\n38:32.280 --> 38:34.120\nWhat happens to, do you have kids?\n\n38:34.120 --> 38:35.120\nAm I insulting you?\n\n38:35.120 --> 38:35.120\nNo.\n\n38:35.120 --> 38:37.120\nOK, I'm sorry.\n\n38:37.120 --> 38:38.480\nYeah, no, I do not have kids.\n\n38:38.480 --> 38:47.240\nOK, so I see what happens to people when they become parents.\n\n38:47.240 --> 38:51.720\nAnd it's something that's great for them.\n\n38:51.720 --> 38:53.200\nEven the coolest parents in the world,\n\n38:53.200 --> 38:55.080\nand I think I have seen them like I've really.\n\n38:55.080 --> 38:57.280\nThe cool parents are the worst.\n\n38:57.280 --> 38:59.640\nWell, they're not the worst, but well, because I.\n\n38:59.640 --> 39:01.040\nNo, they're the worst.\n\n39:01.040 --> 39:05.400\nWell, there's things that it heightens.\n\n39:05.400 --> 39:07.800\nThe actual cool parents who are people who are like, wow,\n\n39:07.800 --> 39:10.480\nwell, that's as good as you're going to get as far as parenting.\n\n39:10.480 --> 39:14.320\nI still recognize the parenting has subsumed their identity.\n\n39:14.320 --> 39:14.920\nBut that's it.\n\n39:14.920 --> 39:18.560\nI mean, the thing like, first of all,\n\n39:18.560 --> 39:21.400\nI'll put my dog up against any baby any day.\n\n39:21.400 --> 39:22.400\nAny day.\n\n39:22.400 --> 39:24.040\nWell, that's a biological killing machine.\n\n39:24.040 --> 39:24.640\nI want to see this.\n\n39:24.640 --> 39:26.240\nThat's not a fair fight.\n\n39:26.240 --> 39:27.480\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n39:27.480 --> 39:29.040\nYour dog could kill more people.\n\n39:29.040 --> 39:29.920\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n39:29.920 --> 39:32.320\nNot a fight.\n\n39:32.320 --> 39:33.160\nNot a fight.\n\n39:33.160 --> 39:36.200\nI'll put my dog up against a baby.\n\n39:36.200 --> 39:38.440\nJust like, what are you going to do?\n\n39:38.440 --> 39:40.320\nAlso, people don't know that.\n\n39:40.320 --> 39:41.320\nMore durable than your baby.\n\n39:41.320 --> 39:45.280\nRob Schrab runs a baby dog fight ring out of his fucking\n\n39:45.280 --> 39:47.280\napartment.\n\n39:47.280 --> 39:51.400\nIt's not at all what I was saying, but sure.\n\n39:51.400 --> 39:53.640\nSo where are these fights if we wanted to buy tickets?\n\n39:53.640 --> 39:56.760\nLike I just said, when you interrupted me,\n\n39:56.760 --> 39:58.760\nthat's not what I meant.\n\n39:58.760 --> 40:01.320\nHow do you get baby blood out of a carpet?\n\n40:01.320 --> 40:03.520\nI didn't mean that.\n\n40:03.520 --> 40:05.880\nWell, club soda.\n\n40:05.880 --> 40:09.200\nComparing my dog to a baby.\n\n40:09.200 --> 40:11.200\nYes, OK, so finish that thought.\n\n40:11.200 --> 40:13.680\nLike a dog is my dog.\n\n40:13.680 --> 40:14.560\nYou could experience it.\n\n40:14.560 --> 40:16.160\nNot a dog.\n\n40:16.160 --> 40:17.000\nMy dog.\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:18.000\nYou can experience loving him.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:21.640\nYour dog, the notorious baby killer.\n\n40:21.640 --> 40:25.760\nLike I just said, that's not what I meant.\n\n40:25.760 --> 40:26.360\nAll right.\n\n40:26.360 --> 40:28.560\nWell, all right, swiveling back over.\n\n40:28.560 --> 40:30.000\nJosh, we can't run.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:37.480\nAnd that's how I charm a new group of people.\n\n40:37.480 --> 40:39.480\nI want to talk about the classic thing.\n\n40:39.480 --> 40:41.120\nBut for kids, maybe it's not classic.\n\n40:41.120 --> 40:45.000\nLike Marxism versus Communism versus Socialism.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:48.320\nMarx versus, like, I just found out\n\n40:48.320 --> 40:51.680\nabout this guy, Michael Harrington, who's like that was,\n\n40:51.680 --> 40:53.400\nhe's dead, right?\n\n40:53.400 --> 40:54.600\nYeah, I guess.\n\n40:54.600 --> 40:56.360\nBut he was an author, activist, whatever.\n\n40:56.360 --> 40:58.640\nHe's sort of the, maybe the, could we say,\n\n40:58.640 --> 41:00.800\nthe Chomsky of the DSA or something?\n\n41:00.800 --> 41:01.240\nI don't know.\n\n41:01.240 --> 41:04.240\nAgain, like he's a guy who I personally haven't really.\n\n41:04.240 --> 41:06.720\nAnd this is like the thing that I love about the DSA\n\n41:06.720 --> 41:09.000\nis I dropped out of high school.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.600\nI have never read Marx.\n\n41:11.600 --> 41:15.440\nI think that socialism is as a concept.\n\n41:15.440 --> 41:18.360\nIt's mostly the liberation of your own body\n\n41:18.360 --> 41:21.160\nfrom, like, a corporate overlord.\n\n41:21.160 --> 41:25.440\nIt's basically the idea of putting the capital,\n\n41:25.440 --> 41:28.200\nputting the means of production, which is specifically\n\n41:28.200 --> 41:29.160\nwhat Marx talked about.\n\n41:29.160 --> 41:32.920\nI've read quotes, specifically, like.\n\n41:32.920 --> 41:36.440\nYou got the Snapple, the limited edition Marx-Snapple.\n\n41:36.440 --> 41:38.040\nYeah, which is weird that his state\n\n41:38.040 --> 41:40.240\nagreed to any sort of commodification.\n\n41:40.240 --> 41:41.960\nYeah, believe it or not.\n\n41:41.960 --> 41:45.360\nI think you had a lot to do with old world blue blood\n\n41:45.360 --> 41:46.320\nrelationships.\n\n41:46.320 --> 41:47.680\nThe futures.\n\n41:47.680 --> 41:50.080\nThe Snapple fortune was, you know,\n\n41:50.080 --> 41:52.720\nthe Marx chewing gum company, which is something\n\n41:52.720 --> 41:54.160\nthey've buried in the history books.\n\n41:54.160 --> 41:55.880\nYeah, they don't talk about that.\n\n41:55.880 --> 41:57.600\nThey're both Procter and Gamble.\n\n41:57.600 --> 42:02.960\nSo, but anyways, but Marx is like, I'm with you.\n\n42:02.960 --> 42:04.200\nI have no research.\n\n42:04.200 --> 42:07.800\nI'm 11 minutes of Wikipedia.\n\n42:07.800 --> 42:11.200\nThe reason I bring this stuff up is because, for instance,\n\n42:11.200 --> 42:14.600\nyour average 16-year-old kid right now, who, for better\n\n42:14.600 --> 42:17.560\nor for worse, is waiting in the same swimming pool\n\n42:17.560 --> 42:23.560\nthat we all are, I'm getting in fights on the reg fam\n\n42:23.560 --> 42:29.000\nwith people who they can, they could be children.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.480\nThey could be 40 years older than me.\n\n42:31.480 --> 42:34.240\nThey could be any of those things and be totally,\n\n42:34.240 --> 42:37.560\nbut we're all splashing around in the same pool.\n\n42:37.560 --> 42:40.280\nAnd that's a distinct advantage to people\n\n42:40.280 --> 42:44.200\nwho are driven by competition and individualism.\n\n42:44.200 --> 42:49.000\nAnd I'll say it, hatred, because you can say, for instance,\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:52.800\nif I were to say, I'm having the DSA on my show tomorrow\n\n42:52.800 --> 42:55.400\nnight, someone might say, for instance, I don't know.\n\n42:55.400 --> 42:56.520\nOh, yeah, great.\n\n42:56.520 --> 42:59.160\nYou guys think Nazis are responsible for all these deaths\n\n42:59.160 --> 43:02.280\nthat you faked, but communism has been responsible\n\n43:02.280 --> 43:06.440\nfor over 80 billion deaths in the last 120 years, blah,\n\n43:06.440 --> 43:10.280\nblah, blah, because they want to label and they want to.\n\n43:10.280 --> 43:12.400\nAnd this is the thing that I would say,\n\n43:12.400 --> 43:15.240\nlike, if there's anything that I've learned,\n\n43:15.240 --> 43:18.280\nit's get off the fucking internet.\n\n43:18.280 --> 43:21.040\nStop your book clubs are fine.\n\n43:21.040 --> 43:23.600\nLike, you can read Marx and talk about whatever.\n\n43:23.600 --> 43:28.320\nBut I learned everything I know about politics,\n\n43:28.320 --> 43:33.240\nabout socialism, about the thing that radicalized me\n\n43:33.240 --> 43:36.840\nwas going and meeting people, hearing people,\n\n43:36.840 --> 43:38.680\nhearing people that work for teachers unions,\n\n43:38.680 --> 43:42.760\nhearing some intellectuals that work as professors\n\n43:42.760 --> 43:48.200\nor whatever, just rank and file union folks and nurses\n\n43:48.200 --> 43:50.520\nand this and that, and talking to all these people\n\n43:50.520 --> 43:55.040\nand watching the action and participating in an action.\n\n43:55.040 --> 43:56.960\nThat's what teaches me.\n\n43:56.960 --> 44:00.920\nAnd to me specifically, I think that we as socialists,\n\n44:00.920 --> 44:03.920\nwe as leftists need to remove ourselves\n\n44:03.920 --> 44:05.800\nfrom the world of academia, because I think\n\n44:05.800 --> 44:07.600\nthat that was purposefully done.\n\n44:07.600 --> 44:09.400\nThat was sort of a move like, oh, let's get them all\n\n44:09.400 --> 44:11.800\nin their little bubbles, their little coastal bubbles\n\n44:11.800 --> 44:13.880\nwhere they just sit and they wear glasses\n\n44:13.880 --> 44:15.240\nand they look like their bones are going to break\n\n44:15.240 --> 44:18.280\nif they wear a sweater and they fucking talk and talk and talk\n\n44:18.280 --> 44:21.280\nand they just want to jerk off over which dead Russian dude\n\n44:21.280 --> 44:22.920\nlike they liked the most.\n\n44:22.920 --> 44:23.760\nRight.\n\n44:23.760 --> 44:24.600\nAnd real.\n\n44:24.600 --> 44:27.480\nPlaying philosophical chess on a daytime talk show.\n\n44:27.480 --> 44:28.320\nSports.\n\n44:28.320 --> 44:29.520\nIt's the same fucking thing.\n\n44:29.520 --> 44:31.480\nIt's who's your team, who's this?\n\n44:31.480 --> 44:34.040\nAnd a lot of politics, not just like leftist politics,\n\n44:34.040 --> 44:38.000\na lot of like national politics is just sports as well.\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:42.040\nBut when you actually get offline and get out of the\n\n44:42.040 --> 44:45.640\nuniversity and go onto the streets and start talking\n\n44:45.640 --> 44:48.160\nabout people and trying to help them like, you know,\n\n44:48.160 --> 44:51.280\nDSA right now, for example, like doing an action\n\n44:51.280 --> 44:53.480\nlike this will teach you more, I think, personally\n\n44:53.480 --> 44:55.360\nabout socialism than reading anything.\n\n44:55.360 --> 44:58.120\nThey're putting on a taillight benefit.\n\n44:58.120 --> 45:01.720\nDSA Los Angeles is doing this inspired by DSA New Orleans.\n\n45:01.720 --> 45:06.520\nSo the thought was people of color, migrant workers,\n\n45:06.520 --> 45:08.880\nyou know, just undocumented folks,\n\n45:08.880 --> 45:12.680\nthey are getting pulled over and they are being thrown\n\n45:12.680 --> 45:13.760\ninto the carceral state.\n\n45:13.760 --> 45:17.000\nThey're being thrown into, you know, if you're undocumented,\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.240\nyou're being thrown into a private prison\n\n45:19.240 --> 45:20.360\nwhere they hold immigrants.\n\n45:20.360 --> 45:21.640\nIt's not like they go to a radison.\n\n45:21.640 --> 45:23.800\nThey go to a private prison.\n\n45:23.800 --> 45:26.120\nOr if you're just a fucking black dude,\n\n45:26.120 --> 45:27.880\nyou're going to get fucked with by the cops\n\n45:27.880 --> 45:31.440\nbecause the police is inherently a racist system.\n\n45:31.440 --> 45:35.840\nAnd so what we're doing is we are for free\n\n45:35.840 --> 45:38.080\nproviding break lights.\n\n45:38.080 --> 45:40.000\nIf your break lights out, that's most likely\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:41.200\nwhat's going to get you pulled over.\n\n45:41.200 --> 45:43.360\nRight, and then they can search your car and stuff\n\n45:43.360 --> 45:44.960\nbecause you look not white.\n\n45:44.960 --> 45:45.960\nRight, exactly.\n\n45:45.960 --> 45:49.400\nAnd it could and likely often does end up\n\n45:49.400 --> 45:51.680\nwith some unarmed person being shot.\n\n45:51.680 --> 45:54.960\nAnd so if we, if that is a concept that's like borrowed\n\n45:54.960 --> 45:57.480\nfrom the black panthers known as like mutual aid,\n\n45:57.480 --> 45:59.760\nwe help them, but they also help us\n\n45:59.760 --> 46:02.080\nbecause we have now ingrained ourselves\n\n46:02.080 --> 46:03.320\nin the community more.\n\n46:03.320 --> 46:05.760\nAnd so we can like get more people\n\n46:05.760 --> 46:07.760\nto go do more cool shit like that.\n\n46:07.760 --> 46:09.680\nIt's like, oh, who's this fucking dude\n\n46:09.680 --> 46:11.200\nthat just gave me a free break light?\n\n46:11.200 --> 46:14.240\nRight, no, we promise we're not asking you for anything.\n\n46:14.240 --> 46:16.360\nLike, we don't want your Facebook login.\n\n46:16.360 --> 46:17.280\nWe don't want any of that shit.\n\n46:17.280 --> 46:21.880\nIf you do that 100 times, then, so turning your money\n\n46:21.880 --> 46:26.520\ninto shit that actually translates with the most\n\n46:26.520 --> 46:29.200\nfidelity into changing an individual life.\n\n46:29.200 --> 46:30.200\nAbsolutely, and it's not shared.\n\n46:30.200 --> 46:30.800\nHow do you do that?\n\n46:30.800 --> 46:33.560\nHow do you just distribute the, I mean, that's awesome.\n\n46:33.560 --> 46:37.760\nRight, so for what we have, if you go to dsa-la.org\n\n46:37.760 --> 46:41.080\nand you look and you click on the tail light benefit page,\n\n46:41.080 --> 46:43.920\nthere is a Kickstarter type thing.\n\n46:43.920 --> 46:48.360\nIt's within our chapters, like a fundraising thing.\n\n46:48.360 --> 46:51.680\nAnd so far, we've raised over $1,000.\n\n46:51.680 --> 46:54.920\nAnd then what happens is we just ask around to friends\n\n46:54.920 --> 46:55.800\nwho know mechanics.\n\n46:55.800 --> 46:58.280\nWe've reached out to high schools that have shop classes.\n\n46:58.280 --> 47:02.520\nWe're looking for a venue now, a large parking lot.\n\n47:02.520 --> 47:04.240\nThe school would be rad because ice\n\n47:04.240 --> 47:07.200\ncan't come on school property.\n\n47:07.200 --> 47:11.480\nAnd so what we do is we then talk to our friends\n\n47:11.480 --> 47:15.160\nand say, hey, who knows how to change a break light?\n\n47:15.160 --> 47:18.680\nThen they run a training for the interested volunteers.\n\n47:18.680 --> 47:21.240\nSo now our volunteers know how to fix their own cars,\n\n47:21.240 --> 47:23.280\nand then they go help fix other people's cars\n\n47:23.280 --> 47:24.360\nand then just talk to them.\n\n47:24.360 --> 47:25.880\nNice, yeah.\n\n47:25.880 --> 47:28.200\nThat's appealing to a guy like me because I'm like, oh, shit.\n\n47:28.200 --> 47:30.960\nNo, I feel a little more macho because I'm\n\n47:30.960 --> 47:32.280\ndealing in break lights now.\n\n47:32.280 --> 47:33.840\nRight.\n\n47:33.840 --> 47:35.320\nYou use your hands to help your community.\n\n47:35.320 --> 47:38.640\nSpeaking of which, not to put you on the spot,\n\n47:38.640 --> 47:40.840\nbut a guy like me.\n\n47:40.840 --> 47:47.540\nSo classically fragile, neoliberal,\n\n47:47.540 --> 47:50.600\nmaybe philosophically progressive, no research,\n\n47:50.600 --> 47:53.800\ntotal comfort zone, five bedroom house,\n\n47:53.800 --> 47:55.880\njust want everything to go back to the way it was,\n\n47:55.880 --> 47:58.360\nshuddering at night, fearing not being\n\n47:58.360 --> 48:01.200\nable to protect my girlfriend from any form of economic\n\n48:01.200 --> 48:03.600\ndestabilization in any manifestation thereof,\n\n48:03.600 --> 48:05.400\njust want my comfort back.\n\n48:05.400 --> 48:08.040\nI felt like I was playing the game right, blah, blah, blah.\n\n48:08.040 --> 48:11.320\nYou can read it all in my pamphlet.\n\n48:11.320 --> 48:15.280\nYou get the picture with me.\n\n48:15.280 --> 48:17.520\nWhether it's the famous version of me,\n\n48:17.520 --> 48:22.080\nbut also I'm selfishly asking, what are more like you're\n\n48:22.080 --> 48:24.120\ndirecting me to that website in this case,\n\n48:24.120 --> 48:29.240\nbut what are little pieces of candy you can hand out?\n\n48:29.240 --> 48:33.920\nOnce I get it on my tongue, at no risk to my own comfort,\n\n48:33.920 --> 48:38.000\nthat when I taste it, it'll start happening for me.\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.120\nThis is a thing that we talk about a lot,\n\n48:40.120 --> 48:43.080\nthat our health care committee, and a lot of people\n\n48:43.080 --> 48:45.880\nworking nationally in the health care committee talk about,\n\n48:45.880 --> 48:49.560\nis the difference between selfishness, selflessness,\n\n48:49.560 --> 48:50.840\nand self-interest.\n\n48:50.840 --> 48:52.080\nThese are three different things.\n\n48:52.080 --> 48:55.080\nSelfishness is, hey, I got all this money.\n\n48:55.080 --> 48:56.600\nI don't want it to go to anybody.\n\n48:56.600 --> 48:58.240\nNo taxes, whatever.\n\n48:58.240 --> 49:00.720\nAnd pure greed.\n\n49:00.720 --> 49:04.440\nOr conversely, I broke my leg.\n\n49:04.440 --> 49:08.200\nI need Medicare for all because my leg is broken.\n\n49:08.200 --> 49:12.120\nSelflessness is, I'm a perfectly healthy person.\n\n49:12.120 --> 49:13.920\nI don't need anything.\n\n49:13.920 --> 49:15.680\nI'll never be sick because I'm in shape.\n\n49:15.680 --> 49:16.200\nTake my bone marrow.\n\n49:16.200 --> 49:17.400\nI've got extra marrow.\n\n49:17.400 --> 49:19.120\nRight, and you're doing this for somebody else\n\n49:19.120 --> 49:20.760\nand not for you at all.\n\n49:20.760 --> 49:28.080\nSelf-interest is, how can I help everybody else out,\n\n49:28.080 --> 49:29.760\nwhile also helping myself out?\n\n49:29.760 --> 49:31.920\nBecause we're all in this together.\n\n49:31.920 --> 49:36.040\nAnd so that's the tone that we're aiming for when we talk to people.\n\n49:36.040 --> 49:37.440\nYou guys like that third one, right?\n\n49:37.440 --> 49:37.680\nYes.\n\n49:37.680 --> 49:38.240\nOK, could.\n\n49:38.240 --> 49:39.600\nBecause that really sounds good.\n\n49:39.600 --> 49:41.400\nBecause it's you and everyone else.\n\n49:41.400 --> 49:42.800\nYour little dance that you did.\n\n49:42.800 --> 49:46.080\nWell, because it's like, there is room in the world\n\n49:46.080 --> 49:52.640\nfor people under an actual form of democratic socialism.\n\n49:52.640 --> 49:54.160\nTell me yes or no.\n\n49:54.160 --> 49:58.920\nI think the big root fear for, I would say especially,\n\n49:58.920 --> 50:00.680\nbut definitely including poor people,\n\n50:00.680 --> 50:04.280\nis, hey, wait, I don't want the rules to monopoly\n\n50:04.280 --> 50:07.840\nto be that you can't have more money than someone else.\n\n50:07.840 --> 50:09.720\nRight, and see, this is a thing that\n\n50:09.720 --> 50:14.160\nis a very successful propaganda campaign.\n\n50:14.160 --> 50:17.040\nIt's conflating communism and socialism, essentially, right?\n\n50:17.040 --> 50:19.760\nYes, and democratic socialism specifically\n\n50:19.760 --> 50:22.000\nis not like a state, like it's not\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.040\nlike this big state power or whatever.\n\n50:24.040 --> 50:26.560\nRoads in Medicare are socialist.\n\n50:26.560 --> 50:27.520\nThen they exist in it.\n\n50:27.520 --> 50:29.640\nSocial security is socialist.\n\n50:29.640 --> 50:30.800\nSo it exists today.\n\n50:30.800 --> 50:31.320\nAbsolutely.\n\n50:31.320 --> 50:32.440\nIt's not communism.\n\n50:32.440 --> 50:34.080\nProbably the most famous form of socialism\n\n50:34.080 --> 50:35.280\nis social security.\n\n50:35.280 --> 50:39.160\nAnd what it is, is it's not only a thing that benefits people\n\n50:39.160 --> 50:42.040\nfrom people that already have too much, where it's like,\n\n50:42.040 --> 50:42.720\nthis is fair.\n\n50:42.720 --> 50:45.000\nWe all agree that everybody knows\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:46.880\nthat the people at the top aren't paying enough.\n\n50:46.880 --> 50:49.880\nAnd so we all can agree that, OK, they just\n\n50:49.880 --> 50:52.760\nget paid a little bit, or they pay a little bit more\n\n50:52.760 --> 50:53.800\ninto taxes.\n\n50:53.800 --> 50:56.360\nAnd then literally, we all have health care.\n\n50:56.360 --> 50:57.920\nWe all have access to a doctor.\n\n50:57.920 --> 50:58.800\nIt's that easy.\n\n50:58.800 --> 51:02.720\nAnd what we want more is a co-op,\n\n51:02.720 --> 51:06.400\nwhere you're a worker, you own your company.\n\n51:06.400 --> 51:07.320\nYou're a shareholder.\n\n51:07.320 --> 51:10.600\nThere's not a room full of faceless number\n\n51:10.600 --> 51:16.800\nmen in gray, smoky suits with fucking guns to a dog's head.\n\n51:16.800 --> 51:18.160\nAnd all the profits go to them.\n\n51:18.160 --> 51:19.320\nAnd stockholders.\n\n51:19.320 --> 51:20.360\nYeah, the shareholders.\n\n51:20.360 --> 51:21.440\nRight, with their interests.\n\n51:21.440 --> 51:23.520\nAnd so a good example of this is another thing\n\n51:23.520 --> 51:25.240\nthat we're doing with the DSA right now,\n\n51:25.240 --> 51:28.720\nwhich is we are trying to help Los Angeles create\n\n51:28.720 --> 51:30.080\na public bank.\n\n51:30.080 --> 51:33.000\nNot for you and me to go to the ATM,\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:35.120\nbut when you think about it, Los Angeles\n\n51:35.120 --> 51:40.560\nhas something like $8 billion in 700 bank accounts\n\n51:40.560 --> 51:44.040\nall at Wells Fargo at that one bank.\n\n51:44.040 --> 51:45.480\nAnd that $8 billion is everything\n\n51:45.480 --> 51:50.120\nfrom your electric bill payments to your taxes, to fees,\n\n51:50.120 --> 51:52.880\nto 401k plans for city clerks.\n\n51:52.880 --> 51:55.520\nWhen that money is in Wells Fargo,\n\n51:55.520 --> 51:58.240\nWells Fargo, then through loans, and dividends,\n\n51:58.240 --> 51:59.680\nand investments, and whatnot, they\n\n51:59.680 --> 52:01.680\nspread that money to Philip Morris.\n\n52:01.680 --> 52:04.680\nThey spread that money to weapons companies, and so.\n\n52:04.680 --> 52:05.840\nKeystone Pipeline.\n\n52:05.840 --> 52:07.280\nExactly, yes, that's one of the big ones.\n\n52:07.280 --> 52:08.600\nWhat's the phrase for this again?\n\n52:08.600 --> 52:11.760\nI saw Sarah Silverman talking about it.\n\n52:11.760 --> 52:12.800\nDivest.\n\n52:12.800 --> 52:13.960\nDivestment.\n\n52:13.960 --> 52:17.960\nAnd so a lot of people, Sarah Silverman, being one of them,\n\n52:17.960 --> 52:20.840\nmyself included, have divested our personal money\n\n52:20.840 --> 52:24.200\nfrom big Wall Street banks and put them into credit unions.\n\n52:24.200 --> 52:28.040\nBut now what we're asking is for cities, for municipalities,\n\n52:28.040 --> 52:30.280\nbecause you and me, and we do like this,\n\n52:30.280 --> 52:33.400\nit's a drop in the bucket, but $8 billion\n\n52:33.400 --> 52:36.120\nthat is not going to get invested in horrible fossil\n\n52:36.120 --> 52:39.800\nfuels or private prisons is a big chunk of change\n\n52:39.800 --> 52:40.280\nto get out of Wall Street's hands.\n\n52:40.280 --> 52:41.560\nYou were talking about that.\n\n52:41.560 --> 52:43.880\nThis idea that local politics started\n\n52:43.880 --> 52:46.520\nto get subsumed by the banking industry.\n\n52:46.520 --> 52:47.800\nI'll be talking out of my ass.\n\n52:47.800 --> 52:49.520\nThere's this YouTube documentary you\n\n52:49.520 --> 52:51.360\ncan watch called Hyper Normalization, which\n\n52:51.360 --> 52:52.000\nis very scary.\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:52.520\nIt's great.\n\n52:52.520 --> 52:53.920\nOne of the things it talked about\n\n52:53.920 --> 52:56.160\nis there is this huge change where\n\n52:56.160 --> 52:59.200\nthe bankers who were de facto funding everything\n\n52:59.200 --> 53:01.120\non the government's behalf because banks\n\n53:01.120 --> 53:04.320\nhave stand to gain from being in the business of government,\n\n53:04.320 --> 53:05.640\nthey're like, yeah, let's go along.\n\n53:05.640 --> 53:06.400\nWe'll give you the loan.\n\n53:06.400 --> 53:07.400\nYou can make this building.\n\n53:07.400 --> 53:08.360\nWe'll make City Hall.\n\n53:08.360 --> 53:09.840\nWe're working together as a team.\n\n53:09.840 --> 53:11.880\nThey went from that to saying, wait a second.\n\n53:11.880 --> 53:13.120\nWe have all the money.\n\n53:13.120 --> 53:14.080\nFuck you guys.\n\n53:14.080 --> 53:16.200\nDo everything we say, because we're\n\n53:16.200 --> 53:18.880\na private corporation that now holds the purse strings\n\n53:18.880 --> 53:20.240\nfor the government.\n\n53:20.240 --> 53:22.400\nAnd when that fundamental power shift changed,\n\n53:22.400 --> 53:24.400\nkind of everything got ruined and fucked.\n\n53:24.400 --> 53:26.760\nSo it sounds like this is kind of a reversal.\n\n53:26.760 --> 53:31.640\nIt's de-fanging the power that private finance\n\n53:31.640 --> 53:33.320\nhas over the government, which shouldn't\n\n53:33.320 --> 53:35.240\nbe in the business of private finance.\n\n53:35.240 --> 53:38.040\nIt should be in the business of aiding people.\n\n53:38.040 --> 53:38.800\nRight, exactly.\n\n53:38.800 --> 53:44.040\nAnd so when your electric bill is sitting at Wells Fargo,\n\n53:44.040 --> 53:46.760\nWells Fargo is making, if you pay your electric bill\n\n53:46.760 --> 53:49.120\nwith a credit card, Wells Fargo gets a fee.\n\n53:49.120 --> 53:51.120\nAnd that's just coming right off the top from the city money.\n\n53:51.120 --> 53:52.120\nNot going to the government.\n\n53:52.120 --> 53:53.960\nYeah, it doesn't go to the government.\n\n53:53.960 --> 53:56.920\nIt doesn't go to make your roads better or your schools better.\n\n53:56.920 --> 53:59.520\nIt goes into some fucking cokehead's pocket.\n\n53:59.520 --> 54:03.120\nAnd so what we want is to create a municipal bank where\n\n54:03.120 --> 54:06.320\nthen all of this money is housed in an institution\n\n54:06.320 --> 54:09.440\nthat's central motive isn't profit.\n\n54:09.440 --> 54:13.920\nIt's central motive is, hey, this is city public money.\n\n54:13.920 --> 54:14.480\nIt's your money.\n\n54:14.480 --> 54:15.000\nIt's my money.\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:16.160\nIt's all of our money.\n\n54:16.160 --> 54:18.480\nIt should stay in Los Angeles.\n\n54:18.480 --> 54:20.440\nAnd beyond that, we should open it up\n\n54:20.440 --> 54:23.600\nso that people historically that have had a hard time getting\n\n54:23.600 --> 54:25.560\nloans can get loans.\n\n54:25.560 --> 54:28.040\nWe can use this money like if it's\n\n54:28.040 --> 54:31.560\nRunwell, which banks happen to be Runwell when it comes\n\n54:31.560 --> 54:34.440\nto collecting a profit at the end of the year,\n\n54:34.440 --> 54:36.240\ninstead of that profit going to bankers,\n\n54:36.240 --> 54:40.000\nthat profit can go into housing or schools and the like.\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:41.720\nThe theory behind the American dream\n\n54:41.720 --> 54:45.280\nis that money is the great equalizer,\n\n54:45.280 --> 54:49.800\nthat it is somehow a supreme kind of metaphor of democracy\n\n54:49.800 --> 54:52.400\nthat doesn't have to happen every four years pulling a lever,\n\n54:52.400 --> 54:57.120\nthat you can work hard and work so hard that love your children\n\n54:57.120 --> 54:59.120\nso much, love your family so much,\n\n54:59.120 --> 55:04.600\nthat you can chisel away at so much fucking coal in a mine,\n\n55:04.600 --> 55:08.920\nwhile your coal mining colleague is like, eh, you know,\n\n55:08.920 --> 55:10.000\nI love mining coal.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.800\nBut I'm going to go home and fucking chill.\n\n55:12.800 --> 55:13.920\nI can't wait to get off of work.\n\n55:13.920 --> 55:15.400\nAnd I figured out a way to mine coal.\n\n55:15.400 --> 55:17.680\nBut that if you, for whatever reason,\n\n55:17.680 --> 55:18.640\nput yourself up by your own stress,\n\n55:18.640 --> 55:19.800\nthat you're like, god damn it, I'm\n\n55:19.800 --> 55:22.280\nfucking going to mine so much fucking coal,\n\n55:22.280 --> 55:25.960\nand that somehow that represents some kind of egress,\n\n55:25.960 --> 55:28.040\nthat you can become a capitalist,\n\n55:28.040 --> 55:30.680\nthat you can become, that you can, you can,\n\n55:30.680 --> 55:35.480\nand that, there are people listening to that\n\n55:35.480 --> 55:37.800\nthat disagree with me politically,\n\n55:37.800 --> 55:41.520\nbut absolutely everyone agrees that that's what's for sale.\n\n55:41.520 --> 55:43.880\nIt is the, whenever anyone detracts,\n\n55:43.880 --> 55:46.480\nso whenever someone like cries out for rights\n\n55:46.480 --> 55:48.960\nor fair treatment, and people start coming down to them\n\n55:48.960 --> 55:50.640\nand saying like, why don't you get a fucking job,\n\n55:50.640 --> 55:52.400\nwhy don't you just work hard, what do you mean,\n\n55:52.400 --> 55:54.000\nisn't this a slippery slope, all this stuff,\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:57.760\nevery, all of those sentiments lead back to the Rome of,\n\n55:57.760 --> 55:59.480\nyeah, but shouldn't we just live in a society\n\n55:59.480 --> 56:02.400\nwhere if you work extra hard, harder than the person\n\n56:02.400 --> 56:04.640\nnext to you, that that represents\n\n56:04.640 --> 56:09.640\na changed opportunity to play the monopoly game?\n\n56:10.840 --> 56:13.080\nRight, and fundamentally it's a flawed premise\n\n56:13.080 --> 56:16.080\nbecause that doesn't take into account historical context\n\n56:16.080 --> 56:18.000\nof people of color being subjugated\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.960\nand generationally not being put in a position\n\n56:20.960 --> 56:22.440\nwhere they can get this job.\n\n56:22.440 --> 56:25.120\nSo that leads white people who don't know\n\n56:25.120 --> 56:28.800\nthat they have started the race at the finish line,\n\n56:28.800 --> 56:30.720\ngoing like, hey, look at these people lagging in the back,\n\n56:30.720 --> 56:33.800\nmaybe if they ran faster, and the thing is,\n\n56:33.800 --> 56:36.800\nit's not your fault if you're a white dude\n\n56:36.800 --> 56:40.200\nthat racism exists, and that's like a big problem\n\n56:40.200 --> 56:42.120\nwith a lot of people on the left\n\n56:42.120 --> 56:46.720\nthat are correctly angry but aren't trying to bring people in\n\n56:46.720 --> 56:50.520\nand go, I don't hate every Trump voter.\n\n56:50.520 --> 56:52.360\nI think that talking about Trump voters\n\n56:52.360 --> 56:56.280\nas this huge amorphous blob of hate is wrong,\n\n56:56.280 --> 56:58.720\nit's wrong-headed, it's bad.\n\n56:58.720 --> 57:01.640\n20% I'll give, 20% of Trump voters,\n\n57:01.640 --> 57:04.040\nirreparable racists, horrible people.\n\n57:04.040 --> 57:07.640\nBut I really truly believe that 80% of Trump voters\n\n57:07.640 --> 57:09.960\nhave a kid that's addicted to opiates\n\n57:09.960 --> 57:11.640\nor lost their house or lost their job,\n\n57:11.640 --> 57:14.320\nand like you said, they kept fucking working hard\n\n57:14.320 --> 57:17.720\nand nothing happened, and so they wanted to make a change.\n\n57:17.720 --> 57:20.040\nThey just wanted to give a big fuck you\n\n57:20.040 --> 57:22.200\nto the system that ruined their lives,\n\n57:22.200 --> 57:24.560\nand the Democrats seeing this,\n\n57:24.560 --> 57:26.040\nand this is why I don't think you can work\n\n57:26.040 --> 57:27.160\nwithin the Democratic Party,\n\n57:27.160 --> 57:29.840\nbecause ultimately, they're beholden to their donors,\n\n57:29.840 --> 57:31.720\nbut they see this, and who do they trot out\n\n57:31.720 --> 57:36.120\nto fight this, the avatar of the status quo?\n\n57:36.120 --> 57:39.440\nAnd you see it happen over and over and over again,\n\n57:39.440 --> 57:40.920\nand the only time that it works\n\n57:40.920 --> 57:43.400\nis if you have literally the most charismatic man\n\n57:43.400 --> 57:46.640\nwho's ever been nominated for president\n\n57:46.640 --> 57:48.840\nto sell that bill of goods to people.\n\n57:48.840 --> 57:52.240\nYeah, and if that ever happened, boy, you'd know it,\n\n57:52.240 --> 57:55.240\nbecause there would be this actual measurable shift\n\n57:55.240 --> 58:00.240\nin everything from economy to society to the point,\n\n58:00.240 --> 58:04.480\nand I'm not kissing his feet, but it's like that's,\n\n58:04.480 --> 58:07.200\nwe cannot wait for another guy that happens\n\n58:07.200 --> 58:10.200\nto be that lightning in a jar, like.\n\n58:10.200 --> 58:12.040\nAs long as it's, I don't know,\n\n58:12.040 --> 58:15.480\nbecause I think Obama as a man is a great man.\n\n58:15.480 --> 58:17.880\nI think he as a president,\n\n58:17.880 --> 58:21.120\nI disagreed with a lot of his decisions,\n\n58:21.120 --> 58:24.960\nobviously compared to the other guys that sandwiched him.\n\n58:24.960 --> 58:29.800\nHe was this golden statue of pure greatness,\n\n58:29.800 --> 58:33.560\nbut when you, I think the Democrats fundamentally\n\n58:33.560 --> 58:35.160\ndon't understand how power works,\n\n58:35.160 --> 58:37.720\nbecause if they did, they wouldn't have lost thousands\n\n58:37.720 --> 58:40.800\nof state legislature seats under Obama.\n\n58:40.800 --> 58:43.000\nHow, when you have such a popular president,\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:47.040\ncan you just get fucking creamed in every local election?\n\n58:47.040 --> 58:50.440\nAnd it's because the Democrats are just so top heavy.\n\n58:50.440 --> 58:54.000\nThey're this big bobblehead that is just doomed\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:56.360\nto fall forward and not move.\n\n58:56.360 --> 58:57.200\nYeah, okay, yeah.\n\n58:57.200 --> 58:58.400\nAnd so that's why we at the DSA,\n\n58:58.400 --> 59:00.800\nwe're not targeting even senators,\n\n59:00.800 --> 59:03.640\nor we want state legislatures and local people.\n\n59:03.640 --> 59:05.520\nIt's the thing that we all have in common with these,\n\n59:05.520 --> 59:07.600\nlet's say these 20% of Trump voters\n\n59:07.600 --> 59:09.440\nwho actually voted on a frustration.\n\n59:09.440 --> 59:12.680\nYou can, we're cousins, all of us,\n\n59:12.680 --> 59:15.920\nif you in your backyard have,\n\n59:15.920 --> 59:17.720\nthere's a pothole that hasn't been filled.\n\n59:17.720 --> 59:18.560\nRight.\n\n59:18.560 --> 59:22.640\nIf by virtue of some bureaucratic absurdity,\n\n59:22.640 --> 59:27.640\nyour kid's leukemia isn't covered.\n\n59:28.480 --> 59:29.840\nEverybody-\n\n59:29.840 --> 59:32.640\nAnd bureaucratic absurdity in that case, by the way, is greed.\n\n59:32.640 --> 59:33.480\nRight?\n\n59:33.480 --> 59:34.480\nIt's definitely greed.\n\n59:34.480 --> 59:38.360\nAnd it's just that because it's just by virtue\n\n59:38.360 --> 59:40.240\nof belt buckles and baseball caps.\n\n59:40.240 --> 59:43.760\nAnd the way that we express when we aren't armed\n\n59:43.760 --> 59:46.000\nwith Noam Chomsky's vocabulary,\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:47.800\nour frustration with a system,\n\n59:47.800 --> 59:51.920\nsome guy right next to me in terms of tax bracket\n\n59:51.920 --> 59:55.440\nand ideology is gonna maybe say key phrases\n\n59:55.440 --> 59:59.640\nthat I have been armed to recognize as the enemy.\n\n59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.920\nWell, when these guys start talking about freedom of speech,\n\n01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.440\nthey mean they want to be Nazis.\n\n01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.320\nWhen these guys start talking about,\n\n01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.720\nwhere's my gold pocket watch?\n\n01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.800\nWhat they mean is that they want this institutionalized thing.\n\n01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.160\nAnd then they're hearing the same thing.\n\n01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.320\nAnd when these people talk about black lives matter,\n\n01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.280\nthey mean blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.880\nAnd it's like, I mean, we've all said it a thousand times\n\n01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.880\nand it's right under our nose.\n\n01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:24.920\nLike the divisions there are so artificially imposed.\n\n01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.080\nThey have to be forced.\n\n01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.880\nOtherwise, if you, like these movies\n\n01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.120\nwhere society collapses and then like within 30 years,\n\n01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.160\nthere's just Ivy and wolves everywhere.\n\n01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.320\nLike there is constant infrastructural pressure\n\n01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.120\nnecessary to maintain a division\n\n01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.880\nbetween a black person and a white person in America.\n\n01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.280\nYou have to wake up every morning\n\n01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.720\nand make sure those two people know\n\n01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.640\nthat they're black and white.\n\n01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.480\nAnd they do.\n\n01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.240\nAnd the powers that be do that.\n\n01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.080\nAnd you know, it starts, you go back to Howard Zinn,\n\n01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.400\nwho is somebody I have read a lot\n\n01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.040\nand really like to find my worldview.\n\n01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.840\nHe talks about how after one of the first big slave rebellions\n\n01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.080\nwhere white slaves and black slaves teamed up,\n\n01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.520\nthe powers that were were like, oh fuck,\n\n01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.200\nif all of the poor people team up, we're fucked.\n\n01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.400\nSo they created the middle class.\n\n01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.560\nThey were like, okay, white slaves in the new world\n\n01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.920\nwhen you guys, you guys got 20 years\n\n01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.400\nand then you'll get a house and you'll get a car\n\n01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.360\nand you'll get, you're not a car, but a horse,\n\n01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.840\nwhich was, they called them cars back then.\n\n01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.400\nBut you get a house and a horse and fucking,\n\n01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.840\nyou know, 40 acres in a mule.\n\n01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.120\nAnd that was so-\n\n01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.760\nThere's a horse in every pot.\n\n01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.360\nA horse in every pot and a chicken under foot.\n\n01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.880\nAnd one day the pot will have wheels, we promise.\n\n01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:42.880\nYeah, the wheel pot and real pot happen.\n\n01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.520\nHell yeah.\n\n01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.600\nSo what that does is that makes it so that,\n\n01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.440\nand you're right, it is this intense artificial pressure,\n\n01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.720\nbut it is very specific and it is there purposefully.\n\n01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.600\nAnd it's to keep the people that are two rungs\n\n01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.920\nfrom the bottom of the ladder kicking down.\n\n01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.120\nJust constantly kicking down.\n\n01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.920\nAnd if we all realize that we're all being fucked\n\n01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.920\nand don't try to buy into the artificial fucking separation\n\n01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.400\nof who we are and allow each other to make mistakes\n\n01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.160\nand whatnot, that's how the labor movement\n\n01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.680\ngot us a weekend.\n\n01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.840\nYou know, it was these, people weren't less racist\n\n01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.840\nback when labor had more power in America.\n\n01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.360\nPeople were more racist.\n\n01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.160\nWe get less racist every year,\n\n01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.720\nbut through great organizing and people that literally died\n\n01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.000\nand standing up for their rights,\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.440\nyou saw black people, white people, men and women team up\n\n01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.680\nto go, we're all getting fucked.\n\n01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.360\nSome of us might be getting fucked less,\n\n01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.360\nsome of us might be getting fucked more,\n\n01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.320\nbut we're banding together because, again, self-interest.\n\n01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.520\nIt helps me, it helps everybody else.\n\n01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.440\nWe need to band together on this.\n\n01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.120\nLet's check in with Rob Schrab after this beat.\n\n01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.280\nGive me a beat.\n\n01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.080\nAnd Rob, I hear you're about

01:03:11.400\nYou give them a small dose of politics, and then entertainment.\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.320\nEntertainment.\n\n01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.000\nShow biz.\n\n01:03:19.000 -->

hole.\n\n01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.120\nI know about that.\n\n01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.400\nCraft a pickaxe and craft some more.\n\n01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.880\nThen you can get more valuable, or you get a diamond,\n\n01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.480\nand you make armor from that.\n\n01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.440\nAnd then you fight the dragon, and the game ends.\n\n01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.840\nBut that's not, it doesn't have to.\n\n01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.560\nAll right, sorry.\n\n01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.640\nI got excited about Minecraft.\n\n01:04:00.640 -->

01:06:32.700\nI did it because I love her.\n\n01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.020\nFuck your mama.\n\n01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.140\nChoo, choo, choo, choo.\n\n01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.100\nHa ha ha ha

01:06:46.540\nYou're the worst.\n\n01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.820\nYou're the worst.\n\n01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:48.660\nOh, it's great.\n\n01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:49.460\nWe're doing it.\n\n01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:50.460\nOh, it's really good.\n\n01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:51.300\nIt's really good.\n\n01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:52.780\nWhat?\n\n01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:53.820\nIt's bad?\n\n01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:56.540\nI fucked your mama like a choo-choo train.\n\n01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.580\nAll right, well, OK, thank you.\n\n01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:05.620\nThat was the exact dance Hilary did on Ellen.\n\n01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:07.100\nIt was great.\n\n01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.060\nLet's hear it for church.\n\n01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.060\nYeah, thanks, church.\n\n01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.060\nHere's for church.\n\n01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.060\nWoo!\n\n01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.060\nWhere did you get that?\n\n01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.060\nWait, church, come back up here.\n\n01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:20.420\nYou guys were talking earlier about going to Thanksgiving.\n\n01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:22.620\nI met her parents.\n\n01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:28.500\nAnd her father is John Goodman from the Big Lebowski,\n\n01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.900\nbut kind of mellow and funny.\n\n01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.780\nAnd he's military.\n\n01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.060\nBut it was cool meeting your family.\n\n01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:40.220\nAnd he declared no political talk, no Trump talk,\n\n01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.780\nno because he's a Trump voter, right?\n\n01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:43.940\nYeah.\n\n01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:47.260\nAnd your mother voted Trump just no.\n\n01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.500\nHe doesn't know that, though.\n\n01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.260\nShe secretly didn't do it.\n\n01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.260\nYeah.\n\n01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:55.220\nAnd he declared before Thanksgiving dinner\n\n01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:57.980\nthat there would be no politics talk.\n\n01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:59.940\nMostly because he knew he'd be outnumbered.\n\n01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:02.140\nYeah, how convenient.\n\n01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.820\nHe's like, no politics.\n\n01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.300\n10 on 1, no fight.\n\n01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:08.620\nYour medals, sir, for silencing discourse\n\n01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:11.660\nduring this holiday, I give you.\n\n01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:14.300\nBut in between dinner and pie, things\n\n01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.500\nstarted to lean towards politics talk.\n\n01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.020\nAnd I went and played Legos with the.\n\n01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.460\nBecause he wanted more pie.\n\n01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:21.660\nNo, I had a fair amount of pie.\n\n01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.620\nHe wanted a bigger piece of pie.\n\n01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:29.660\nYeah, Dan, it was trickle down, cool whip.\n\n01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:33.980\nA lot of people think that if you put out more cool whip,\n\n01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:36.020\nit'll trickle down onto more pie.\n\n01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:36.620\nIt's not true.\n\n01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.220\nIt's not true.\n\n01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:38.500\nNo, I'll eat it all.\n\n01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:42.700\nBut Church is a genius because she's like Spock.\n\n01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.140\nYou're a logic junkie.\n\n01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.340\nAnd you can take your dad out.\n\n01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.220\nShe took him out for an hour outside, smoked cigarettes.\n\n01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.220\nOr you smoked, he vaped.\n\n01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:56.140\nAnd they came back in, and you had fucking.\n\n01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:57.060\nAnd I had fixed him.\n\n01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:58.900\nYou had sorted him out.\n\n01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:00.140\nSorted him out.\n\n01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.420\nTemporarily.\n\n01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:02.340\nWait, explain.\n\n01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:05.380\nHow tangible was this fix?\n\n01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:08.100\nWell, most people, when they talk to my father,\n\n01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.380\nand I've noticed this online, too,\n\n01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.460\nand this happens with my uncle and my cousins,\n\n01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:16.980\nis people react really emotionally to the obviously\n\n01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:18.940\nheinous shit that they're saying, the excuses they're\n\n01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:20.700\nmaking for things that are inexcusable.\n\n01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:23.220\nAnd the truth is, is that everything\n\n01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:26.180\nkeeps coming back to this but Hillary argument.\n\n01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:29.580\nAnd the reason is, is that all of those excuses,\n\n01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:32.700\nall of those defending of Roy Moore's and all this crap\n\n01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.980\nthat's happening right now is really just\n\n01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:38.020\na defending of the decision they made to vote for someone\n\n01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:39.420\nbecause they hate Hillary.\n\n01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:42.100\nIt's got nothing to do with him as a president\n\n01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.900\nor anything that's happening.\n\n01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:47.340\nAnd especially with my father being the military guy,\n\n01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.780\nhe's got this notion of the greater good that also\n\n01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:51.940\ncomes from a military, like, well, war is ugly\n\n01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:53.660\nand things are terrible, and you've\n\n01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:54.620\ngot to get through it.\n\n01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.700\nAnd you know that some things are going to be bad,\n\n01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:59.060\nbut in the long run, it's all going to be better.\n\n01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:04.380\nAnd that's how he judges Roy Moore's right now.\n\n01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.420\nBecause it's for the greater good in his eyes,\n\n01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.660\nbecause we had to do this because Hillary.\n\n01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.380\nWe were avoiding this horrible thing.\n\n01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.100\nAnd I think that that's a lot of people and their perspective.\n\n01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.460\nAnd they saw everybody dancing the streets about hope\n\n01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:19.260\nand change, Obama's election, and then,\n\n01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:22.260\nas a matter of historical economic course,\n\n01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:25.580\ntheir lives didn't get better.\n\n01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:28.340\nAnd so that obvious connection is made there.\n\n01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.940\nOtherwise, if you're not a politician,\n\n01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.340\nIt's like Sarah Palin's like, how's\n\n01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.180\nall that hope and changey stuff going for you?\n\n01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.220\nAnd everyone's like, yeah, actually.\n\n01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.700\nWe indoctrinate everybody into this dichotomy system\n\n01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.500\nwhere we go like, OK, here's the Rockham Robot,\n\n01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.260\nhere's the Sockham Robot, and then.\n\n01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:51.180\nAnd I mean, this idea that we have to defend not voting\n\n01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:55.820\nfor Hillary, it's kind of like a macrocosm of saying\n\n01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.940\nat the emergency room, like, now, honey, you know,\n\n01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.700\nlike, you made me do that.\n\n01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.380\nWell, my dad literally at one point goes, well,\n\n01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.500\nI didn't start it, and I was like, what are you, five?\n\n01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.460\nAnd he starts laughing.\n\n01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:08.700\nYou know, I didn't want to do that.\n\n01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:09.820\nWhat's going on right now?\n\n01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:11.700\nLike, I'm like, you just keep saying,\n\n01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.660\nyou keep going back to this saying.\n\n01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:15.900\nAnd at a certain point, you've got to realize, like,\n\n01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:17.460\nthat's over, that's done.\n\n01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.980\nNo one's trying to take away from you\n\n01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:23.020\nyour rationale for why you voted the way you did for this piece\n\n01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:26.460\nof human garbage, because you were throwing the dice.\n\n01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:30.340\nBut now that he's president, judge him for what he's doing.\n\n01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:32.700\nAnd he was like, yeah, OK, you know, you're maybe right.\n\n01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:36.500\nAnd I'm like, OK, so like, if I actually understand,\n\n01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:41.900\nand I go like, OK, I think I know why you're making arguments\n\n01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:44.380\nthat I know that you don't even believe right now.\n\n01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:46.220\nLike, I know why you're making the excuses\n\n01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:47.380\nthat you're making right now.\n\n01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.380\nIt's like, I know that you don't think\n\n01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:53.060\nthat it's OK for a 32-year-old man to fuck a 14-year-old.\n\n01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:55.780\nSo why is my father saying that right now?\n\n01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:58.340\nOh, it's because he's defending the indefensible,\n\n01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.660\nbecause he has an idea of some kind of greater good\n\n01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.340\nand some greater battle that's happening right now.\n\n01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:04.980\nAnd he's making excuses.\n\n01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.500\nIn his mind, I would say some of the people\n\n01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:10.500\nwho are defending Roy Moore.\n\n01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.580\nCareful, he's a friend.\n\n01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.540\nThey might.\n\n01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:14.660\nBig friend of the show, too.\n\n01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.780\nI had no interest in defending Al Franken.\n\n01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:20.740\nAnd then I read that one article that was like,\n\n01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:26.060\nwait, if Franken gets yanked from the picture,\n\n01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.100\nthis is a blow against net neutrality.\n\n01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:31.100\nAnd then I was like, then that, because I don't care\n\n01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.340\nif a senator gets fucking hauled up\n\n01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:36.100\nto the Robocop police station desk\n\n01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:40.420\nand forced to fucking account for being a,\n\n01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.620\nthey woke up committing a crime if they're a politician.\n\n01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:43.700\nThis is America.\n\n01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:45.180\nIf you're a politician, you should already\n\n01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.580\nbe suspected of everything.\n\n01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:48.420\nAnd you should wake up with shame,\n\n01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.380\nbecause you're getting paid to do fucking jack shit.\n\n01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.300\nYou're a parasite.\n\n01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:55.140\nSorry, but it's a cushy gig.\n\n01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:56.380\nYou're a fucking politician.\n\n01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:57.900\nEat my dick.\n\n01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.620\nAnd wake up every morning in a world\n\n01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.780\nwhere you have to prove that you're not a criminal.\n\n01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:02.860\nYou're a politician.\n\n01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.980\nBut then I was like, oh shit, net neutrality.\n\n01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:06.900\nGod damn it.\n\n01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.500\nIs this a goddamn conspiracy?\n\n01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.580\nThis Republican woman.\n\n01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.780\nWait, there's the picture of him doing the titty honk,\n\n01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:13.300\nbut his fingers aren't touching her.\n\n01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.700\nYou can see shadows under them.\n\n01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.220\nMy mom and I were bonding about this.\n\n01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:17.500\nYou can see shadows under them.\n\n01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:18.260\nHe's not touching.\n\n01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.740\nIt's a just, the only other thing is her story about tongues.\n\n01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:23.540\nAnd then she got fucked up.\n\n01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:25.900\nAnyone watching this from the outside would start to go,\n\n01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.740\nwhat would look at me and go, boy, you Democrats,\n\n01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.900\nyou'll do anything to, you just love violating women.\n\n01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.540\nWell, and I think that this brings up\n\n01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.460\na really valuable point of discussion\n\n01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.060\nwhere we need to not have it in 140 characters\n\n01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.100\nor we need to actually talk to each other about this shit.\n\n01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:46.900\nBut the unavoidable truth that we as people on the left\n\n01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:51.380\ncan do and should hold ourselves to a higher account\n\n01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:52.660\nthan people on the right.\n\n01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:56.260\nAnd you don't see Roy Moore getting this much pressure\n\n01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.260\nfrom the right.\n\n01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:00.820\nAnd that's not good that the right's doing that.\n\n01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.260\nWe shouldn't, like there's no answer to this right now,\n\n01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:06.260\nbut it's something to really talk about and think about.\n\n01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.780\nBut again, remember, I think that it's because inherently\n\n01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:13.780\nthey're trying to defend their guy and their party right now.\n\n01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.820\nAnd they're constantly having to do that.\n\n01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.900\nSo every time one of theirs goes down,\n\n01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:24.860\nthey're like, fuck, we gotta make every excuse,\n\n01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.340\nwe gotta find a way, they're lying or whatever it is,\n\n01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:28.980\nwe're on the left, we're going,\n\n01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:32.540\nI'm not mad at the women who accuse Al Franken.\n\n01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.780\nI'm like disappointed in Al Franken.\n\n01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.660\nAnd I'm going like, God damn, we need you, you know,\n\n01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.660\nlike God, how many others might have fucked up.\n\n01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:41.060\nBut if you're really into net neutrality,\n\n01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.620\nyou might even be, you might even start to go\n\n01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:44.860\nover the weekend, I started to go,\n\n01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:46.420\nis this a conspiracy?\n\n01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.900\nRight, well, it's happening though.\n\n01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.780\nWhich is now I'm defending a sexual,\n\n01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:52.460\nnow you're just the same,\n\n01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.580\nlike it's the same magical thinking.\n\n01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.060\nAnd it's like, yeah.\n\n01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.020\nNow I'm a zealot.\n\n01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.940\nMy guys are all infallible\n\n01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:01.380\nbecause we're the guys with the white hat on\n\n01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:02.700\nand your guys are all garbage\n\n01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.100\nbecause they have the black hat on\n\n01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.860\nbecause we think that good and evil\n\n01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.060\nis a black and white thing.\n\n01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:09.540\nAnd if you look at like the board,\n\n01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.860\nif you look at the whole chess board,\n\n01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:13.900\nthe right has won all three branches of government.\n\n01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.020\nThe FCC is probably gonna like fucking.\n\n01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.020\nYeah, there's nothing we can do.\n\n01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:18.060\nThere's nothing we can do.\n\n01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:19.940\nWe should fight, but there's nothing we can do.\n\n01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.500\nLike we should absolutely try,\n\n01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:25.300\nbut Al Franken isn't gonna change much, I think.\n\n01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.900\nIf you really like pull back\n\n01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:28.900\nand look at how much power the right has.\n\n01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.060\nAnd to your point, which is a really good point,\n\n01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:34.220\nI think that part of this is like these people\n\n01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:38.140\nare conditioned on all sides to come at this defensively.\n\n01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:40.580\nLike, and that's a problem of the media.\n\n01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:42.540\nThat's a problem of online discourse.\n\n01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:45.300\nThat's a problem with the way in which we talk\n\n01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:48.340\nabout politics because we get too emotionally invested.\n\n01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:50.100\nWell, and it's the way we talk about each other too,\n\n01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.500\nbecause dehumanization is, I think,\n\n01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:53.940\nat its worst point right now.\n\n01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:57.580\nAnd by dehumanization, like, for me,\n\n01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:00.820\nyou know, it's all about the other, right?\n\n01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:04.260\nAnd the other would be anybody who's so different\n\n01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:08.780\nfrom your way of being that they are not human anymore,\n\n01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:11.220\nto you, like, because you can't form empathy for them,\n\n01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:13.100\nwhether that's like, and right now,\n\n01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.660\nthat's as simple as being a Democrat and a Republican.\n\n01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:19.460\nIt's as simple as driving a Prius instead of a Ford F-150.\n\n01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:20.300\nYeah.\n\n01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:23.140\nLike, that's literally, that's enough for people to say,\n\n01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:24.780\noh, you're not a man.\n\n01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:27.620\nLet's make it even simpler because let's talk about\n\n01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:30.420\n25-year-olds who can't afford a Prius or a Ford F-150\n\n01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:32.180\naren't making that decision, and therefore,\n\n01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:34.740\nthose decisions are actually ideological for them.\n\n01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:37.380\nAnd every day, for better or for worse,\n\n01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:40.180\nwhether they should be doing it or not,\n\n01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.980\nthese people are living online.\n\n01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:46.980\nAnd every, and their chimpanzee spinal cords\n\n01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:50.860\nare jacked up by these interactions they're having.\n\n01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:52.340\nI just did it today.\n\n01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:55.220\nI'm a 44-year-old grown-ass man.\n\n01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.180\nI've gotten one fight with my girlfriend\n\n01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.860\nwhile traveling, this entire Thanksgiving,\n\n01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:00.780\nall these connecting flights, all this stress.\n\n01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:02.060\nWe even high-fived each other\n\n01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.700\nand even knew we were jinxing it.\n\n01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:04.540\nWe didn't fight.\n\n01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:05.460\nWe traveled as a couple.\n\n01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:06.540\nWe didn't fight.\n\n01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:10.540\nWe had one kerfuffle and it was absolutely centered around,\n\n01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:12.380\nI got on Twitter.\n\n01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:22.340\nThe important thing seems to be that the way\n\n01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:27.340\nthat the internet is, the nature of it favors,\n\n01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.860\nI'm just gonna use simple language.\n\n01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:31.500\nIt favors Nazis.\n\n01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.940\nIt does not favor hippies.\n\n01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.420\nIf you want people to be happy,\n\n01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:42.420\nyou are having to overcome obstacles on the internet.\n\n01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:44.540\nIf you want people to be angry,\n\n01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:47.060\nif you want people to be afraid,\n\n01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:49.220\nevery step you take, it's like you're on one\n\n01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:52.060\nof those airport conveyor belt things\n\n01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:55.580\nwhere every step you take takes you five steps further\n\n01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:59.820\nand the left is walking against it\n\n01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.180\nbecause technology, until we figure out a way\n\n01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.340\nto add a wire to the internet cables\n\n01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:07.980\nthat makes you feel what the other person is feeling,\n\n01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:11.940\nit's like we're in this pool together\n\n01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:13.100\nand we're just going like,\n\n01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.340\noh, I want everybody to be happy\n\n01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.340\nand it kind of touches on your thing\n\n01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.380\nand I don't know if it's a good thing to use.\n\n01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.780\nWe should use this as an example though\n\n01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.500\nbecause it's like you're clearly,\n\n01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:23.900\nyou're on a blue streak.\n\n01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.340\nYou're a charismatic, amazing voice to have out there.\n\n01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:29.420\nYou're a comedian that is a dedicated socialist\n\n01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:32.420\nand maybe I'm just drunk or maybe I like you,\n\n01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.740\nbut it's like, wow, you're a weapon\n\n01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:40.740\nin the arsenal of making this shit work\n\n01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:44.300\nand yet through no one's fault really,\n\n01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.780\nexcept for the way we operate\n\n01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:49.060\nversus how the enemy operates,\n\n01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.860\nyou had to resign from an official position\n\n01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:56.020\nbecause of a joke you made because we can't,\n\n01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:57.900\nif you're interested in equality,\n\n01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:02.820\nyou can't, that doesn't merge well with jokes.\n\n01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:07.420\nThe less tolerance is being used against us right now.\n\n01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:08.260\nAnd we're also-\n\n01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:11.140\nThe fact that we stand for all of that equality\n\n01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:13.140\nand we want everything to be like fair\n\n01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:15.780\nand all of these things that they call us a snowflake for\n\n01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:19.460\nis absolutely being used against us, particularly online.\n\n01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:22.100\nAnd then the moment that we get as ugly as they do\n\n01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:24.460\nand go, okay, let's tussle in the mud then,\n\n01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:26.060\nlet's get down and dirty here,\n\n01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.820\nthey go, whoa, look who's triggered\n\n01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:31.260\nand where's your tolerance now?\n\n01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:32.620\nSo much for the tolerant left.\n\n01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:34.460\nSo much for the tolerant left.\n\n01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:35.780\nLook at you, you're all mad.\n\n01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:37.180\nIt's so easy to trigger these things.\n\n01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.660\nAnd also in the meantime,\n\n01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.580\nyou guys can't even get along with each other.\n\n01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:41.420\nRight.\n\n01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:43.340\nLook at all these women arguing with each other\n\n01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:44.940\nabout blah, blah, blah, what do you expect us\n\n01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:45.780\nto take this seriously?\n\n01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.140\nYou guys can't even stop pillow fighting about this.\n\n01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:50.140\nIt's just condescending.\n\n01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.900\nLook, you're not an army.\n\n01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:55.540\nWell, to the point specifically about my thing,\n\n01:19:55.540 --> 01:20:00.300\nI fucked up in allowing ammo for that.\n\n01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:03.140\nI tweeted a thing, a Bill Cosby joke\n\n01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:06.100\nthat now I agree with people,\n\n01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:07.860\nlike it was right after the Weinstein thing\n\n01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.780\nand no woman needs to go online\n\n01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:11.780\nand see some fucking white dudes posing\n\n01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:13.460\nwith Bill Cosby's star.\n\n01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.220\nI see how people would be upset.\n\n01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:18.460\nAnd I gave them a context free way\n\n01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:20.180\nfor everybody to get mad at me.\n\n01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:21.700\nFrom the right to the left, like,\n\n01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:24.660\noh, you're a fucking pussy for apologizing and resigning.\n\n01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:26.260\nOh, you know, like, how dare you?\n\n01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:30.820\nAnd truly, I, as a, I'm not a politician.\n\n01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:31.980\nI thought I was a politician.\n\n01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.740\nI thought that I could be in this position\n\n01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.860\nwhere you're going to be judged so harshly\n\n01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:38.660\non everything you say and everything you say\n\n01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.220\nrepresents this group.\n\n01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:42.140\nAnd I made it very clear in that moment,\n\n01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:43.340\nno, I don't want to do that anymore.\n\n01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:46.580\nI don't want to have the DSA's reputation\n\n01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.860\non the hook for me because I'm a comedian\n\n01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:52.500\nand I'm a writer and so I inherently take certain risks\n\n01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:53.660\nand fall on my face.\n\n01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:55.380\nAnd when I do that in front of a crowd,\n\n01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:57.780\n40 to 100 people don't like me.\n\n01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:00.180\nBut when I do it on Twitter as the face of the DSA,\n\n01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:03.220\nthat could bring down the left if, you know,\n\n01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:04.740\nweaponized correctly.\n\n01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:07.220\nAnd so I see where things, you know,\n\n01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:09.180\nwhere it made a lot of sense for me to resign.\n\n01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.620\nOn the other side of that spectrum,\n\n01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:14.100\nlike you said, if you know who I am\n\n01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:17.940\nand you know the context, nobody in the local chapter\n\n01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:21.820\nthat knows me got super upset with that,\n\n01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:24.380\nnobody who is like my friend,\n\n01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.100\nnobody who knows that I was making a reference\n\n01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:28.420\nto taking Confederate statues down,\n\n01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.420\nknows that I led a charge to get the Confederate statue\n\n01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.780\ntaken down at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\n01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:37.740\nBut that's my fuck up for giving them this ammo.\n\n01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.420\nSo we, like especially within our leadership,\n\n01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:42.740\nneed to hold ourselves to an even higher standard.\n\n01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:45.420\nAnd so what I want to do now is sort of just be\n\n01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:47.980\na little bit more of a Steve Bannon, but good,\n\n01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:51.060\nwhere you can help people say things\n\n01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:53.380\nand take what is the internet,\n\n01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:54.580\nwhat is the internet good for?\n\n01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:58.940\nI think it's good for like radicalizing and ideology.\n\n01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.020\nAnd you see podcasts-\n\n01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:01.340\nAnd it's bad for that too.\n\n01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:04.260\nWell, it's bad for that if it's bad ideology.\n\n01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:08.980\nIt's good pure, like morally ambiguous radicalization,\n\n01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:11.460\nwhether it's for ISIS or for the good guys.\n\n01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.340\nLike the internet can do that.\n\n01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:15.540\nAnd I think the Democrats, and a big reason\n\n01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.140\nwhy I'm upset with the Democrats,\n\n01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.980\nis that they won the culture war,\n\n01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:22.180\nbut they seeded the ideological battle\n\n01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.620\nfor no fucking reason.\n\n01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:26.420\nThey got rid of union halls, which was the one place\n\n01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:29.700\nwhere people, like poor people, people of color,\n\n01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.980\nworking class people, met up and talked face to face.\n\n01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:35.980\nAnd then on the internet, all it is is fucking gifts\n\n01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:38.860\nand the West Wing and Harry Potter references.\n\n01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:41.460\nThere's no, there's no ideology.\n\n01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:43.860\nAnd that's what socialism and specifically,\n\n01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:46.580\nfor me, democratic socialism gives me,\n\n01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.460\nis it gives me this fuel to understand,\n\n01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:51.500\noh, this is happening because of this.\n\n01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:54.820\nI know, because this guy that I like fucking told me this,\n\n01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:57.700\nor this woman who rules taught me this thing\n\n01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.260\njust by watching her do it.\n\n01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:00.100\nWell, so, okay.\n\n01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.940\nSo I know you're saying, like, first and foremost,\n\n01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:06.260\nconsider getting off the internet more and more.\n\n01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.420\nYeah.\n\n01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:08.780\nIt will always be there.\n\n01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:09.980\nIt runs everything.\n\n01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:12.260\nYou can get caught up within a moment.\n\n01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:14.620\nYou could spend an entire week off of Twitter\n\n01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.620\nfrom my experience, and not a lot has changed.\n\n01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.900\nThat's not the same as telling you\n\n01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:20.700\nyou're wrong for currently being on it,\n\n01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:22.140\nor anything like that.\n\n01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:24.180\nOrder to tune out and stop being informed, either.\n\n01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:26.780\nThat's not tuning out and stopping being informed.\n\n01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:27.620\nYeah.\n\n01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:30.260\nAnd so, but, however, and then there's,\n\n01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.100\nso there's that, it's like everybody experiment\n\n01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:34.460\nwith like, start spending more time in the real world\n\n01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:35.940\nand blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:39.900\nFor those of us who are just gonna do tomorrow\n\n01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:43.940\nwhat we did yesterday, but wanna put like one tag\n\n01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:47.860\nfor our tag cloud, one little piece of awareness\n\n01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.340\non how we spend tomorrow.\n\n01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:54.100\nAnd sadly, we're gonna spend tomorrow texting, tweeting,\n\n01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:58.220\nposting, reacting, commenting, arguing, fighting,\n\n01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.860\ngetting mad, getting scared.\n\n01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.180\nAcquiescing to that saying,\n\n01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:04.820\nthat's how we're gonna behave tomorrow.\n\n01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:07.300\nWhat's, is there some kind of little algorithm,\n\n01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:10.420\nsome kind of little call to consciousness\n\n01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.420\nthat harms nothing, threatens nothing,\n\n01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:15.420\ndemands almost nothing.\n\n01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.260\nJust.\n\n01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.100\nYes.\n\n01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:19.460\nEvery interaction, everything you see online,\n\n01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:21.420\nevery way that you're reacting to it internally\n\n01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:23.860\nand every conflict you start getting in\n\n01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:28.020\non a comment section, like, is there some kind of.\n\n01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:30.780\nSo what I've done personally that's really helped me\n\n01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:35.180\nis you have to recognize that national media\n\n01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:40.180\nfocuses on national storylines that you can't affect.\n\n01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:44.860\nYou can't change this huge thing.\n\n01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.260\nSo what I've done is I've stopped watching cable news.\n\n01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:51.620\nCable news, inherently, it's only there to scare you\n\n01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.340\nand make you buy, you know, fucking Centrum Silver\n\n01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:55.780\nor whatever.\n\n01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:58.860\nAnd to delegitimize fringe voices\n\n01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:01.300\nin favor of corporate status quo.\n\n01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.140\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:02.980\nBut where am I gonna find out\n\n01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.500\nwhether or not I can sue somebody for Mesocilioma?\n\n01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.620\nGame show network.\n\n01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:08.940\nOkay.\n\n01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:11.420\nI mean, the Game Show Network is the only channel I watch\n\n01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:12.980\nand that's what you should do.\n\n01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:13.820\nNo whammies.\n\n01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:16.700\nThese fuckers want you to sue somebody\n\n01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.020\nfor Mesocilioma.\n\n01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:18.860\nIt's crazy.\n\n01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:19.700\nThey're gonna find you.\n\n01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:20.780\nAre you suggesting though,\n\n01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:23.540\nbecause it's like suggesting that people.\n\n01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:27.820\nPay attention to Trump in only how he can entertain you\n\n01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:28.940\nby being an idiot.\n\n01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.780\nIs there a way to start shifting over\n\n01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.660\nfor all of us Facebook, Twitter addicted,\n\n01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.420\nTumblr addicted, everybody like so.\n\n01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:36.300\nWe could shift over to local.\n\n01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.940\nThese things all have local.\n\n01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:40.980\nYes, roots and it all starts at the local level.\n\n01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:44.660\nSo there is a DSA chapter or PSL,\n\n01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:46.700\nwhich is the party for socialism and liberation.\n\n01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.740\nThere are progressive groups.\n\n01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.460\nIf you don't have like a socialist,\n\n01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:53.820\nlike find the most left most people in your community.\n\n01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.380\nYou can follow groups on Twitter.\n\n01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:56.220\nYeah.\n\n01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:57.060\nAre the local.\n\n01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:00.340\nYeah, DSA Los Angeles, DSA, you know.\n\n01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:02.700\nAnd then your Twitter feed is gonna be injected\n\n01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:07.020\nwith a little bit of, oh, the Los Feliz Boulevard.\n\n01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:10.820\nThis is happening there at the corner of this and that.\n\n01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.460\nYou're gonna go, whoa, let's just down the block\n\n01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:13.300\nfrom my house.\n\n01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:14.140\nExactly.\n\n01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.980\nAnd that might start a kind of,\n\n01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:19.500\nyou might actually decide one day you got nothing to do\n\n01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.020\nand like you know the address they're talking about.\n\n01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.060\nYou know the shopping center\n\n01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:25.860\nthat where this is happening and that.\n\n01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:28.980\nRight, so what'll happen is like an account,\n\n01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:31.260\na DSA account or one of these other leftist accounts\n\n01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.820\nwill retweet about a state bill.\n\n01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:37.620\nAnd a state, like state bills are where power is\n\n01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:38.460\nin your state.\n\n01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:42.180\nLike we live in a country that allows a lot of states rights.\n\n01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:44.900\nThere was a big fight about it a couple hundred years ago.\n\n01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:45.740\nBut what.\n\n01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:48.460\nI generally disagree with it, but it's what we have.\n\n01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:49.420\nWhich is what we have.\n\n01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:54.420\nAnd so using what we have, we can look at a situation.\n\n01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:58.500\nHave you, have any of you ever called a state representative?\n\n01:26:58.500 --> 01:26:59.580\nYeah, a couple times.\n\n01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:02.060\nOh wait, no, no, that's not a U.S.\n\n01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:05.740\nNot a U.S. congressman, not a Senator, a state rep.\n\n01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:08.060\nRight, the only people that call state senators\n\n01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:10.780\nare like, excuse me, my mailman's two Chinese.\n\n01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:11.620\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.580\nLike they're the craziest people in the world.\n\n01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:15.900\nAnd there are these really important bills\n\n01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:18.180\ngoing through California, for example,\n\n01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:20.660\nhas Medicare for all bill that's been shelved,\n\n01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:23.620\nbut with enough popular pressure could be brought back.\n\n01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:26.700\nThese people, like when you call your state representatives,\n\n01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.100\nnot your national representatives,\n\n01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:31.220\nthey're so happy to not be talking to a blind racist.\n\n01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:34.340\nTo fucking Clint Eastwood in Grand Torino.\n\n01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.100\nBecause those are the people who call.\n\n01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:39.980\nAnd your efforts, you know, it takes fucking,\n\n01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:41.940\nit takes effort to go into lunch break\n\n01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:43.260\nand look up the number and fucking,\n\n01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:44.460\nbecause you're working all the time\n\n01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:47.180\nto find the phone number to call for Nancy Pelosi\n\n01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:48.420\nto just ignore you.\n\n01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:49.820\nOr fucking Dianne Feinstein\n\n01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:51.500\nto not even fucking pick up the phone.\n\n01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.340\nOh yeah.\n\n01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.700\nAnd literally, there was somebody in LADSA\n\n01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:58.660\nthat sent a pizza with pepperoni spelling out\n\n01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:00.780\nlike our message to them because they wouldn't,\n\n01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:03.580\nthere was like, don't confirm,\n\n01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.820\nwhat's the guy that looks like the Kebler Elf?\n\n01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:06.660\nSessions.\n\n01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:07.500\nDennis Kucinich?\n\n01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.340\nOh, dating myself.\n\n01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:10.260\nYeah, it's like, you know,\n\n01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:12.100\nto get through to those people so hard,\n\n01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:15.300\nbut you as an individual, look at where your power lies.\n\n01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:17.900\nYour power lies in your community.\n\n01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:20.620\nAnd so if you just change the trajectory\n\n01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:24.500\nand make a call a week about an issue\n\n01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.860\nthat it's like, look and see what state measures\n\n01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:27.700\nare going on.\n\n01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:28.540\nBut it also might be helpful to say,\n\n01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.180\nyour life lies at the local level.\n\n01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:31.020\nYes.\n\n01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:33.940\nLike if you actually become one of these people,\n\n01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:36.540\nand I think we've encountered old people that we kind of,\n\n01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:37.500\nwe're like, what's with them?\n\n01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:39.820\nLike they're so passionate about the fucking twigs\n\n01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:41.540\nand gathering on the street corners or whatever.\n\n01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:44.500\nLike, well, become the cool version of one of those people.\n\n01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.540\nAnd you'll be following your comfort level\n\n01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.340\nbecause it's your neighborhood.\n\n01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:51.580\nAnd you'll also like, because I think also it's like,\n\n01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:52.940\nif you're thinking the whole time,\n\n01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:55.780\nwell, I'm gonna hand this blanket or this tail light\n\n01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:56.620\nto this person.\n\n01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:59.140\nAnd in so doing, I'm gonna take down Trump.\n\n01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:00.900\nYou're gonna get frustrated every time you come home\n\n01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.220\nto 900 Trump tweets.\n\n01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.060\nExactly.\n\n01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.020\nAnd feel like you're acting in futility.\n\n01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:07.180\nBut all right.\n\n01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:08.780\nWell, goddamn, I mean.\n\n01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:10.580\nAnd one last thing, if you don't mind.\n\n01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:11.980\nYeah, go for it.\n\n01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:14.100\nAnd also like fucking talk.\n\n01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:15.020\nWhat the?\n\n01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:15.780\nJesus.\n\n01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:17.380\nOh, shit.\n\n01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:20.820\nJeff's a secret alt-right agent\n\n01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:23.300\nwho's trying to undercut your message.\n\n01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:27.620\nI've said this before, but like the reason the Tea Party won\n\n01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:30.020\nis because they serve tea.\n\n01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:32.620\nThey don't watch prestige television and they don't fuck.\n\n01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:34.340\nLike that's the reason why they won.\n\n01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:37.540\nThey, all they do is this.\n\n01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:41.540\nBut there are so many fewer of them than there are us.\n\n01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:43.580\nSo if we just do a little bit,\n\n01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:45.580\nand you can still fucking watch the deuce,\n\n01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.940\nJames Franco's surprisingly good in it.\n\n01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.420\nAnd you can still watch fucking,\n\n01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:51.100\nwell, you know, whatever shows you wanna watch\n\n01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:53.700\nor be on Bumble or fucking whatever,\n\n01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:55.140\nbut just like once a week,\n\n01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.660\njust like look and see what's going on in your community\n\n01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:58.500\nand do that.\n\n01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.180\nAnd if enough of us give,\n\n01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:02.100\nI mean, that's what socialism's all fucking about.\n\n01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:03.980\nIt's enough of us working a little bit\n\n01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:07.340\nso that the rest of us don't have to work super fucking hard.\n\n01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:09.260\nAnd I think that fundamentally is the way\n\n01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:11.260\nthat we need to look at the world.\n\n01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:12.100\nAll right.\n\n01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:15.300\nYou can go to city, like public hearings and stuff too,\n\n01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:16.900\nlike local government.\n\n01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:19.340\nI don't know, like on NPR, you always hear like,\n\n01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:21.340\noh, it's 7 p.m. on a Tuesday.\n\n01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:23.940\nSo we're gonna take you now to the Santa Monica City Hall\n\n01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:26.540\nwhere a bunch of people are gonna get mad about parking.\n\n01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:29.740\nAnd like, you can be one of those people mad about parking\n\n01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:31.820\nand you can have a lot better ideas.\n\n01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:33.780\nAnd it's not like, well, I mean, it's the same thing\n\n01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:36.580\nabout like these races calling like the state senators.\n\n01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:38.340\nIt's like the people who go there\n\n01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:41.580\nare generally crazy old people with stupid concerns.\n\n01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.580\nAnd I bet a lot of people are, you know,\n\n01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:45.500\nwilling to hear reasonable concerns\n\n01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.020\nfrom less stupid people.\n\n01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:48.740\nAnd the proof of that right now\n\n01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:51.860\nis that like through a divest LA\n\n01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:55.260\nand definitely check out divest LA and public bank LA\n\n01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:56.380\nif you live in Los Angeles.\n\n01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:58.620\nAnd there's great public bank movements\n\n01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:01.500\nin the Bay Area and all across the country.\n\n01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.340\nLike they did exactly that.\n\n01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:06.180\nThey went to a local city council meeting\n\n01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:08.940\nand various local neighborhood council meetings\n\n01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:10.540\nand were like, hey, we have this idea\n\n01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:12.860\nand it generated enough.\n\n01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:16.260\nAnd this was directly in response to the pipeline shit,\n\n01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:19.100\nthe Dakota Access Pipeline Wells Fargo's involvement in that.\n\n01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:24.020\nAnd what happened was without any real like stalling\n\n01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:27.700\nor anything like a smooth, smooth ride,\n\n01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:31.260\nthe city council unanimously voted\n\n01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.980\nto divest $40 million from Wells Fargo.\n\n01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:36.060\nAnd it was just like a couple people\n\n01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:38.180\nthat like look like us that, you know.\n\n01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:38.940\nThey just showed up.\n\n01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:40.980\nThat just showed up and we're like talking about it.\n\n01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.860\nAnd then, you know, next thing you know,\n\n01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:45.380\nthe world is billions of dollars better.\n\n01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:47.460\nAnd that's where it counts.\n\n01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:49.620\nIt turns out we have good ideas.\n\n01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:50.340\nYeah.\n\n01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:52.180\nWell, I felt like my initial instinct was,\n\n01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:56.580\nokay, I'm going to have, I had my Eleanor Democrat on\n\n01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:58.700\nand I have my, I'm going to have the DSA on\n\n01:31:58.700 --> 01:31:59.860\nand I'm going to have Antifa on.\n\n01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:01.100\nI'm never going to have a Nazi on.\n\n01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:04.460\nI, I, but, but, you know, much as I met Spencer\n\n01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:06.380\nby asking, is there a dungeon master here?\n\n01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:08.420\nI feel like you're, you know,\n\n01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:10.420\nyou were not being indoctrinated into any cult\n\n01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:14.620\nor political party when we talk about acting locally\n\n01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:15.460\nand all this stuff.\n\n01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:20.460\nAnd, and you're very charismatic and, and, and unthreatening.\n\n01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:23.460\nYou're definitely de-coagulating my defense mechanisms.\n\n01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:26.060\nAnd therefore, let's say you're LA based, right?\n\n01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:26.900\nYeah.\n\n01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:28.980\nLet's have you back sooner than later\n\n01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:31.940\nbecause let's start the conversation at like,\n\n01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:32.900\nwhat should we do?\n\n01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:36.460\nLike, like locally because then like locally can mean\n\n01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:38.060\nlocally everywhere that everyone's watching\n\n01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:43.060\nand it doesn't, Jesus Christ, he hates, he hates progress.\n\n01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:44.540\nHe loves symbols.\n\n01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:47.340\nBut, and so let's give us one more time.\n\n01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:50.740\nI guess maybe the website, if people want to just start.\n\n01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:51.580\nYeah.\n\n01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.900\nI mean, dsausa.org is the national website.\n\n01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:59.900\nYou can follow dsa on Twitter, on dsaLA is dsa-la.org.\n\n01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:03.460\nBut I encourage you, I'm not here to tell you\n\n01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:04.980\njust to join the DSA.\n\n01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:07.020\nThose are the people that I found that.\n\n01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:08.820\nMost importantly, because I think the biggest thing\n\n01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:10.180\nthat's gonna trigger people is like,\n\n01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:12.940\nwe're not, we're not Bernie Broen necessarily here.\n\n01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:15.860\nNo, and there are people that are, you know, okay.\n\n01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:20.300\nSo the thing that made me join is I went with a friend\n\n01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.780\nof mine to a meeting right after the election\n\n01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:26.020\nand I was like, you know, I'll give these guys a shot.\n\n01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:26.860\nLet's see what happens.\n\n01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:29.380\nAnd I saw a bunch of fucking white dudes with glasses\n\n01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:30.900\nand various forms of facial hair\n\n01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:32.700\nthat look like they listen to podcasts all the time.\n\n01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:33.780\nAnd I was like, okay, okay.\n\n01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:35.780\nIt's like a bunch of guys like me or whatever.\n\n01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:39.460\nAnd then the person that was leading the meeting,\n\n01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:42.100\nthe chair at the time was this amazing,\n\n01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:44.820\nwitchy old woman named Carol, who I love,\n\n01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:47.140\nwho is like one of the greatest women\n\n01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:48.900\nin the history of politics.\n\n01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:52.420\nShe flipped over a bus during an anti-Vietnam protest\n\n01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:54.220\nand just kept the seat warm.\n\n01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:55.860\nBecause her baby was under it.\n\n01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:56.700\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:58.660\nThat's why she had the magic of the power.\n\n01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:01.940\nI don't approve of female strength on physical levels.\n\n01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:02.780\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:05.420\nShe's a regular she-hulk and she,\n\n01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:10.300\nso she said like, okay, who's here,\n\n01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.180\nwho doesn't really necessarily vibe with DSA\n\n01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:15.300\nbut is just here for, you know, just to see what's up.\n\n01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:18.180\nAnd this guy came up and he was like, I'm a Democrat\n\n01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:20.620\nand I am not gonna change that at any time.\n\n01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:22.500\nHe was like an older man and he was like,\n\n01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:25.860\nI just wanna be somewhere and with a group of people\n\n01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.340\nthat can help point me in the right way\n\n01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:29.060\nto help change the Democratic Party,\n\n01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:31.060\nis it okay if I'm in here?\n\n01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:33.460\nAnd there were like kind of like snickers,\n\n01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:34.620\nlike, you know, a little bit.\n\n01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.660\nAnd then Carol walks up and goes,\n\n01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:39.020\nnow I'm sure a lot of you disagree with this tactic.\n\n01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.140\nI'm sure a lot of you disagree\n\n01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:43.580\nwith working within the Democratic Party\n\n01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:44.660\nand we're like nodding our heads.\n\n01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.940\nAnd she's like, how many of you are willing to do the work\n\n01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:49.420\nthat he's gonna do in the Democratic Party?\n\n01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:51.660\nAnd we were all like, not me.\n\n01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:55.100\nAnd she's like, right, so we have a big tent\n\n01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:57.340\nwhere it's called a big tent organization\n\n01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:00.140\nwhere if no matter what your level involvement is,\n\n01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.020\nno matter what your politics are,\n\n01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:04.740\nif you want to help locally on issues\n\n01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:07.820\nthat I guarantee you you agree with,\n\n01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:10.540\neverything from like, hey, maybe we shouldn't put spikes\n\n01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:13.820\nunder overpasses so homeless people can't live\n\n01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:16.540\nin under our precious overpasses,\n\n01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:19.540\nMitch O'Farrell, city council person of Los Angeles.\n\n01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:23.740\nLike, you'll find that.\n\n01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:26.220\nAnd then beyond that, you'll be able to find,\n\n01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:28.180\nlike we don't just, we're not on a amorphous blob.\n\n01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:30.060\nWe have our housing and homelessness committee,\n\n01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:34.060\nwhich is focused on doing things like street watch,\n\n01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:37.540\nwhich cops go and illegally fuck up homeless encampments.\n\n01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:39.940\nPeople that have a job and a computer and a phone\n\n01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:42.660\nand are right there ready to get a fucking apartment,\n\n01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:44.020\nthey'll go in and bust all their shit\n\n01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:45.940\nand break all their shit completely illegally.\n\n01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.300\nSo we have a couple people who are comfortable\n\n01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:49.740\nwaking up at four in the morning\n\n01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:51.700\nwhen we have a Google number, gets called\n\n01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:53.060\nand says there's a sweep coming\n\n01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:54.660\nand they just stand there with their phones\n\n01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:57.620\nand they just videotape and the cops don't fuck with people.\n\n01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:59.740\nSo like, if that interests you, you can do that.\n\n01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:03.380\nIf you're into healthcare, if you're into prison abolition,\n\n01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:05.940\nwho's doing a lot of great work with our mutual aid,\n\n01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:07.220\ngroup on the taillight benefit,\n\n01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:09.100\nlike all of, there's all these different causes.\n\n01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.260\nAnd maybe just maybe if what you're really good at\n\n01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:14.140\nis sitting in your, in front of your computer\n\n01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:16.660\nand following your kind of anger and outrage\n\n01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:19.820\nand trolling people, there might even be a job for you\n\n01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:22.460\nthat actually ends, you know, you can use those skills\n\n01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:24.300\nif you wanna feel like you're fucking with people.\n\n01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:25.940\nYou know what's the best thing in the world?\n\n01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:27.900\nFucking real life trolling.\n\n01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:30.820\nWe ruined Mayor Garcetti's election party\n\n01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:34.620\nbecause he was capitulating with Trump and not,\n\n01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:37.460\nhe wasn't calling Los Angeles a sanctuary city,\n\n01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:39.540\nwhich by the way, it still fucking isn't.\n\n01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:42.300\nAnd so he was letting our,\n\n01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:44.180\nbecause he wants the Olympics so fucking bad,\n\n01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:47.580\nhe was letting the cops work hand in hand with ICE\n\n01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:48.620\nand fuck people over.\n\n01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:50.220\nThere was this big story that I'm not sure\n\n01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:51.900\nif you remember in Highland Park\n\n01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.540\nwhere a dude was literally dropping his daughter off.\n\n01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:56.260\nHe had a DUI 40 years ago.\n\n01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:57.940\nIt's the only crime he ever committed.\n\n01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:59.580\nAnd he was just snatched.\n\n01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:00.740\nIt's one of the first ones.\n\n01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.140\nYeah, Romulo was his name.\n\n01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:04.980\nAnd he luckily because of public pressure was let out.\n\n01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:08.100\nBut in response to this, we used our anger\n\n01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:12.060\nand we found out, well, shit, the mayor is getting elected\n\n01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:13.780\nin what is gonna be a landslide.\n\n01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:15.140\nMight as well be running on a post.\n\n01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:16.180\nHe's throwing a big party.\n\n01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:18.860\nIt's a boring election with a lot of press.\n\n01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:20.460\nLet's go fuck it up.\n\n01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:23.260\nAnd so a hundred of us showed up and started yelling\n\n01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:25.420\nabout getting ICE out of Los Angeles.\n\n01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:28.900\nAnd we had people infiltrate and interrupt his speech.\n\n01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:30.860\nAnd then what ended up happening was people\n\n01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:32.660\nthat worked for the mayor came out to us\n\n01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:34.580\nlike during the party, like kind of were like,\n\n01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:36.700\nhey, keep doing stuff like this, please.\n\n01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:38.740\nBecause we never get pressure from the left.\n\n01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:40.100\nIt's always pressure from the right.\n\n01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:43.220\nAnd so we kept pressuring on and granted,\n\n01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:44.300\nthis wasn't our idea.\n\n01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:47.660\nWe had groups like that organized and documented people\n\n01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:51.060\nthat are on the front lines who can't go be\n\n01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:53.860\nso fucking confrontational with the mayor.\n\n01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:56.220\nBut we as a group of mostly white people\n\n01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:59.820\ncan use our privilege to amplify their voices\n\n01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.140\nand put ourselves in the way of jail time,\n\n01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:03.260\nwhich they're not gonna arrest a bunch\n\n01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:04.540\nof fucking white people.\n\n01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:06.460\nLike that's just not how cops work.\n\n01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:09.380\nAnd so we yelled and we yelled and we yelled and we yelled\n\n01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:12.660\nand two weeks later, he passed special order 40,\n\n01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:17.140\nwhich makes it so that no Los Angeles city official\n\n01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.740\ncan collaborate with ICE.\n\n01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:22.740\nAnd it's like, that's trolling that fucking works.\n\n01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:25.580\nThat's just you being, we literally did the Simpsons,\n\n01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:30.660\nEric, Eric, while he was getting his fucking makeup on.\n\n01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:32.180\nAnd it was fun and-\n\n01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:33.500\nAnd there may be people out there that don't,\n\n01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.980\nthey're like, well, I don't wanna do that.\n\n01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:36.940\nI don't wanna be a troll and all that stuff.\n\n01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:38.460\nAnd so there's, but there's-\n\n01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:41.140\nYou can give low income women rides to abortion clinics\n\n01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:42.140\nbecause people do that too.\n\n01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:43.100\nThere's every personality.\n\n01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:45.060\nIt's like when you start, when you run a TV show,\n\n01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:49.140\nyou go like, there's people who love writing fanfic,\n\n01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:52.540\nlike 500 pages of what if stuff.\n\n01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:55.620\nThere's people who just, who hate those people,\n\n01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:57.180\nbut they can love the same TV show.\n\n01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:00.500\nI'm translating this into my own fucking narcissistic thing.\n\n01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:04.860\nSo anyways, I hate to, I don't wanna be the guy\n\n01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.700\nthat cuts off the guy that's passionate\n\n01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:09.140\nand is doing good by talking.\n\n01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:11.540\nBut if we cut into D&D time,\n\n01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:14.420\nwe'll be undercutting the entire DSA.\n\n01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:16.420\nThey'll be the reason we didn't play D&D.\n\n01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:20.060\nBut let's resolve that, whether it's like a segment,\n\n01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:23.140\nyou come back for 10 minutes per show or whatever\n\n01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:28.140\nand help me reform myself as a locally active person.\n\n01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:33.060\nI'm too drunk, I'm making too many promises.\n\n01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:35.700\nBut something where we have you back very soon,\n\n01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:38.300\nI really appreciate your willingness,\n\n01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:41.460\nespecially in light of how, you know,\n\n01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.740\njust hearing about your recent, like,\n\n01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:46.820\nkind of brush up against the PC thing\n\n01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:48.260\nand how that must fucking suck\n\n01:39:48.260 --> 01:39:50.420\nfor somebody that just wants to be.\n\n01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:54.100\nYou're a hero to me because you clearly care\n\n01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:56.060\nabout this stuff enough to keep, like,\n\n01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:00.540\nplunging along and actually saying this shit, so.\n\n01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:02.660\nThe movement's more important than me.\n\n01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:05.340\nAnd so, ultimately, the reason that I resigned\n\n01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:07.260\nis it was like, I don't want to be a wait on the movement.\n\n01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:09.540\nThat's a threshold I'd love to cross.\n\n01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:11.380\nAnd maybe you can help me in the way I'm, like,\n\n01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:13.660\nyou know, Brandon and Duncan, like, help me, like,\n\n01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:15.620\nstay positive instead of negative and stuff.\n\n01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:20.260\nBut so, let's go, thank you, Josh and Drosky,\n\n01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:21.100\nfor coming by. Thank you.\n\n01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:23.260\nWe'll see you again soon, and, uh...\n\n01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:40.140\nMUSIC\n\n01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:43.540\nYeah, and just again, he's not officially\n\n01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:46.060\na spokesperson for the DSA.\n\n01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:49.620\nHe just, uh, they, again, didn't step up to the plate.\n\n01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:51.980\nIf it gets your dander up, there might be a couple...\n\n01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:53.980\nWell, I'm sympathetic... Everything gets my dander.\n\n01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.660\n...if you're like, oh, I'm a Harmontown fan.\n\n01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:58.780\nI don't... I delineate that from politics.\n\n01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:01.420\nSo, what I don't like is for my Harmontown episode\n\n01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:05.220\nto be entirely about, um, politics.\n\n01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:07.860\nI... Sure, I sympathize with that.\n\n01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:08.900\nI would submit to you.\n\n01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:11.220\nI do not know what Harmontown is supposed to be,\n\n01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:14.220\nwhich is why sometimes it is something\n\n01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:16.060\nthat you find amazing.\n\n01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:18.660\nAnd I think there are probably some people\n\n01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.100\nthat are orgasming right now,\n\n01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:22.580\nbecause we finally... We walked the walk a little bit\n\n01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:24.660\nin terms of a booking and, like, holy shit,\n\n01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:27.620\nthat was a... That was a signal to boost, I think,\n\n01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:30.020\nbecause I've been babbling forever about, um,\n\n01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:31.460\nacting locally and all this shit,\n\n01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:32.460\nand I don't know how to do it.\n\n01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:33.060\nYeah.\n\n01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:34.780\nAnd so making a friend that actually knows\n\n01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:36.980\nhow to walk that walk is important to me.\n\n01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:39.220\nAnd what's important to me should be important to you.\n\n01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:41.980\nSo, fuck you, Julie.\n\n01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:43.340\nYeah, Julie.\n\n01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:45.740\nWith your joint dangling from your mouth,\n\n01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:49.140\nthinking Harmontown's so great,\n\n01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:53.060\nbut only when he raps about fucking my mama.\n\n01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:54.260\nIs Steve Levy here tonight?\n\n01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:54.780\nNo.\n\n01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:59.620\nWhich is why we need to replace him with...\n\n01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:00.620\nShhh.\n\n01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:01.620\nShhh.\n\n01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:02.620\nShhh.\n\n01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:03.620\nShhh.\n\n01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:04.620\nShhh.\n\n01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:05.620\nShhh.\n\n01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:06.620\nShhh.\n\n01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:07.980\nLet's bring Rob Schrab back up.\n\n01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:09.980\nRob Schrab!\n\n01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:12.460\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:14.940\nAlmost there, I guess.\n\n01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:18.020\nOh, shit.\n\n01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:20.820\nHe put a chair on the stage.\n\n01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:23.620\nHe's rolling about.\n\n01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:27.340\nRob, since you have wheels, go get our character sheets\n\n01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:28.940\nfor us, so you...\n\n01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:33.460\nRob Schrab is going to devros his way across our stage.\n\n01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:34.740\nThis might hurt him.\n\n01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:44.580\nRob Schrab is nothing if not a showman.\n\n01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:48.020\nRob Schrab, gathering up our character sheets.\n\n01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:52.340\nGoing to hand Dan, Dan's character sheets.\n\n01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:56.900\nAnd just a side note, if you want to join the D&DSA,\n\n01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:58.740\nyou can roll your character sheet.\n\n01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:02.100\nWe're using standard point buy arrays.\n\n01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:02.900\nOh, man.\n\n01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:04.340\nScionic classes are off the table.\n\n01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:06.100\nI have an exciting thing to talk to you about,\n\n01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:07.580\nrole-playing-wise.\n\n01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:12.740\nSo this guy, who I talked to for, I guess, probably\n\n01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:16.660\na hot Adderall vodka-induced hour and a half or so\n\n01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:18.700\nfollowing one of our shows.\n\n01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:21.100\nAnd I was just talking to him about that Blacksburg Technical\n\n01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:26.780\nResearch Center game, Space Time and Time Lords.\n\n01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:28.140\nRemember I babbled to you about that,\n\n01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:30.140\nlike this role-playing game that I...\n\n01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:31.060\nAnyways, he...\n\n01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:32.340\nWhere you're playing yourself?\n\n01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:32.860\nHe...\n\n01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:33.460\nYes.\n\n01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:33.860\nOK.\n\n01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:34.460\nWhere you play yourself.\n\n01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:38.500\nSo this is a system where you approximate your own real life\n\n01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.420\nattributes.\n\n01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:40.660\nIs Rob going to play Steve?\n\n01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:42.540\nIs Rob playing Diarrhea Jr.?\n\n01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.420\nI mean, he'll do whatever he wants,\n\n01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:46.580\nregardless of what anyone attempts or desires.\n\n01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:49.060\nHe certainly is doing it right now.\n\n01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:53.060\nIf you haven't paid $5 a month for our subscription,\n\n01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:55.300\nyou're missing out on one of life's great treasures.\n\n01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:57.420\nThis has mostly been a non-visual show,\n\n01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:00.980\nbut these couple of minutes are certainly\n\n01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:03.780\na phenomenon unto itself.\n\n01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.780\nI'm really worried he's going to hurt himself.\n\n01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:08.500\nLike, he's just going to roll off the stage.\n\n01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:09.980\nI hope that happens.\n\n01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:13.780\nLike, that's the thing about a rolling chair on a platform.\n\n01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:15.780\nLike, one wheel goes off the edge,\n\n01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:19.660\nand I don't care if you're Jackie Chan, you're dead.\n\n01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:25.980\nBut why are you on the side of that, you know?\n\n01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:27.180\nAll right, let's have fun.\n\n01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:28.060\nWe're all going to die.\n\n01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:32.740\nSuspenser, Rob, are you going to play the role of Steve Levy\n\n01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:33.260\nafter Diarrhea?\n\n01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:35.180\nYeah, what do you want to do, Rob?\n\n01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:36.260\nSure.\n\n01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:37.500\nDo you want to be an NBC?\n\n01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:38.260\nWhat do you want to be?\n\n01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:39.060\nWhat?\n\n01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:40.540\nA non-player character.\n\n01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:44.580\nI'll be a non-player character, because I'd like to see that.\n\n01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:46.820\nWere you disappointed when you came to the show\n\n01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:47.780\nand then there's a guy?\n\n01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:51.780\nIt's like, I'm talking politics, and you're like,\n\n01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.460\noh, I'm not going to come anymore.\n\n01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:54.460\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:56.580\nNo, I'm sharing my insecurities.\n\n01:44:56.580 --> 01:44:58.060\nYeah, we want to know what you're feeling.\n\n01:44:58.060 --> 01:44:59.500\nI like it when you show up.\n\n01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:04.540\nI'm sorry, I've had a rough couple of days.\n\n01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:05.740\nOh, wait, what do you mean?\n\n01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:06.340\nWhy?\n\n01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:07.860\nYeah, let's talk about that.\n\n01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:10.620\nI'll tell you about it later, but I'm fine.\n\n01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:12.060\nIs it lolly sick?\n\n01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.060\nNo.\n\n01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:13.820\nIs Kate sick?\n\n01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:16.300\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:19.100\nWait, what's going on?\n\n01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:20.100\nI'll talk.\n\n01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.540\nNo, it's not to the stage.\n\n01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:23.580\nOh, OK, it could be.\n\n01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:24.140\nWhat?\n\n01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:25.740\nLet's act it out.\n\n01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:27.380\nOK.\n\n01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:28.140\nIt's your boss.\n\n01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:30.420\nI'm really out of breath from doing all that.\n\n01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:32.060\nI was out of breath from dancing,\n\n01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:33.540\nand then I had to start rapping.\n\n01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:36.740\nAnd I was like, man, I can't even fucking breathe.\n\n01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:39.020\nIt's a bummer.\n\n01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:40.420\nWhat a life.\n\n01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:44.300\nThis mic is quieter than the others?\n\n01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.900\nWell, it's because when you, but the genius thing is that the.\n\n01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:49.820\nOh, because it's me?\n\n01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:54.500\nWell, no, the streamers, it's like,\n\n01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:56.940\nit's unmistakably a live performance.\n\n01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:59.100\nBut then when you listen to it and I have,\n\n01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:02.340\nlike, man, this goes to Zach and Chris, like, I mean,\n\n01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:04.900\nthey're walking a fucking crazy tightrope.\n\n01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.420\nThey're recording streaming live audio\n\n01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:09.100\nthat when you listen back to it, it\n\n01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:10.900\nsounds like a real podcast episode.\n\n01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:12.860\nLike, it's not compromised by the fact\n\n01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:14.540\nthat we're doing it in a warehouse.\n\n01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:18.780\nBut I think as performers, we benefit from visually\n\n01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:21.460\nfrom being in this space as opposed to the audio.\n\n01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:23.420\nBut thank you for bringing it up so I can give props\n\n01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:24.660\nto our amazing engineers.\n\n01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:29.500\nI have a little bit of a business housekeeping question.\n\n01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:29.900\nOK.\n\n01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:30.940\nWho farted?\n\n01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:32.060\nI don't know.\n\n01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:34.500\nIt really smells like a fart.\n\n01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:36.660\nOh, recently.\n\n01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:39.460\nDo you think it was Josh Andraski from the GSA?\n\n01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:41.140\nOr your girlfriend?\n\n01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:43.500\nThat was a long time ago.\n\n01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:44.620\nThis is a present fart.\n\n01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:49.580\nNo, it wasn't me, because the minute you started going,\n\n01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:51.100\nI'd like to ask a question.\n\n01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:53.220\nI almost said, who farted?\n\n01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:54.860\nOh, well, it had to be Josh then,\n\n01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:56.020\nbecause I didn't smell anything.\n\n01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:57.420\nSo it had to be Josh.\n\n01:46:57.420 --> 01:47:01.420\nIt's either Jeff in an incredible werewolf game\n\n01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:02.740\nlevel of manipulation.\n\n01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:06.900\nI would either not bring it up, or I would say, sorry,\n\n01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:08.380\neverybody, I farted all over.\n\n01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:11.460\nUsing my werewolf skills that always get me taken out\n\n01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:14.940\nwithin the third round, I think that, yeah, I think Jeff did it.\n\n01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:15.540\nI didn't do it.\n\n01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:16.100\nI swear to God.\n\n01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:17.500\nI'm not accusing you of doing it.\n\n01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.060\nI'm just saying that that's even more\n\n01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:20.820\nold world rules than that.\n\n01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:23.540\nWhoever smelt it, dealt it, I believe.\n\n01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:26.940\nAnd whoever denied it supplied it if I'm not mistaken.\n\n01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:30.580\nGuys, somebody farted on me.\n\n01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:32.220\nSomebody farted on me.\n\n01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:34.620\nAnd I thought we all needed to address that.\n\n01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:35.380\nNo, we should.\n\n01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:37.740\nBut I'm just thinking about the options.\n\n01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:40.100\nAnd in my head, it's got to be one of you two.\n\n01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:41.260\nWell, it's certainly wrong.\n\n01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:43.820\nWell, if it was me, it'd be really obvious.\n\n01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:45.180\nWell, that's because I am.\n\n01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:47.580\nYou were rolling around crop dusting.\n\n01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:48.300\nI didn't.\n\n01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:49.020\nI swear to God.\n\n01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:49.260\nI know.\n\n01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:51.180\nThat's why it's too obvious to be you.\n\n01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:52.660\nThat's why I think it must be Jeff.\n\n01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:54.700\nIf I farted all over the stage, I would be the first to say,\n\n01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:56.980\nsorry, everybody, I sneak attack.\n\n01:47:56.980 --> 01:48:00.220\nI don't know if it's a fart, because it keeps on rolling,\n\n01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:01.100\nbecause as you.\n\n01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:02.460\nIt could be like a Burbank thing.\n\n01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:04.300\nYeah, I mean, as you've been talking,\n\n01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:08.340\nit's been kind of like wafted through a couple of times.\n\n01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:10.700\nIt's been wafting and railing through the fucking stage.\n\n01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:11.420\nIt could be the.\n\n01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:13.500\nSchrab was rolling around the stage.\n\n01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.500\nYeah, but I didn't.\n\n01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:19.900\nThey start making the farts in Burbank, the early shift.\n\n01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:20.860\nThat might be it.\n\n01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:23.260\nSo then you can get your fresh Burbank farts.\n\n01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:24.220\nI swear to God, it wasn't me.\n\n01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:24.820\nIt's 6 AM.\n\n01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:25.900\nI'm not blaming anybody.\n\n01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:28.100\nI just felt like somebody farted on my head.\n\n01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:30.140\nDo you remember the tannery?\n\n01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:31.980\nI was just in Milwaukee.\n\n01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:33.580\nYeah.\n\n01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:35.020\nMilwaukee smells there.\n\n01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:38.500\nHow was the college talk?\n\n01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.420\nMy art school talk was great.\n\n01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:41.140\nLife changing.\n\n01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:42.300\nDid you like Dan's intro?\n\n01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:42.980\nDid you use it?\n\n01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:43.740\nYes, I did.\n\n01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:44.860\nEverybody applauded.\n\n01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:45.540\nThe full edit?\n\n01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:48.660\nNo, he's the only non-rapping one.\n\n01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:49.300\nYeah.\n\n01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.020\nWell, that's, I mean, we just see that.\n\n01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:51.820\nThe wraps were a failure.\n\n01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:52.620\nThe wraps were a failure.\n\n01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:53.380\nThey weren't a failure.\n\n01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:54.580\nThey were just a different take.\n\n01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:56.980\nDid you use the wrap where he rhymed Bukake?\n\n01:48:56.980 --> 01:48:57.460\nNo.\n\n01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:57.940\nNo.\n\n01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:58.440\nOK.\n\n01:48:58.440 --> 01:48:59.420\nYou didn't use any of the wraps.\n\n01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:01.220\nHe used the verbal one.\n\n01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:02.220\nThe verbal one.\n\n01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:04.100\nThis guy is going to swivel in a chair\n\n01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:05.620\nand tell me he didn't fart on me.\n\n01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:07.580\nI did not fart on you.\n\n01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:09.220\nHe just seems like that's guilty.\n\n01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:12.580\nIf I farted on you, you would know.\n\n01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:15.460\nBecause I'd be going, I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:18.980\n$500.\n\n01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:24.180\nIn Florida, as if they didn't have enough troubles,\n\n01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:28.380\nsometimes their tap water just smells like a fart.\n\n01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:32.180\nOutside my hotel, I was like, what's that fart smell?\n\n01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:34.660\nAnd then my parents would be like, well, that's just tide.\n\n01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:35.780\nTide comes in, goes out.\n\n01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:37.220\nWhen it goes out, leaves dead stuff.\n\n01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:38.580\nMilwaukee, we're no stranger to that.\n\n01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:39.860\nThe dead eel lives there.\n\n01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:41.420\nThey smell like rotting fish.\n\n01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:43.740\nThe tannery.\n\n01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:47.700\nBut the tap water, I was brushing my teeth one morning,\n\n01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:51.300\nand then I brush my teeth, and then I go in, and I cup,\n\n01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:54.420\nand I slurp my rinsing water out of the tap.\n\n01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:56.820\nWhat?\n\n01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:58.380\nIs this like the standing wiper thing?\n\n01:49:58.380 --> 01:49:59.900\nI'm going to find out I do the retrospective.\n\n01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:01.460\nWe have 10 minutes to play D&D.\n\n01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:04.060\nSo Spencer, you want to catch us up?\n\n01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:04.940\nYeah.\n\n01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:07.700\nHonestly, what happened, you guys?\n\n01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:09.380\nDan, do you remember anything that happened?\n\n01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:12.020\nI remember fighting zombies as we just\n\n01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:14.580\ngot to the town of Embershot.\n\n01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:16.380\nYeah, I think what happened is you\n\n01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:19.260\nwere just on the cusp of the town of Embershot,\n\n01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:22.540\nwhich whose name will be revealed.\n\n01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:24.660\nGreat.\n\n01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:26.420\nI remember we fought the zombies.\n\n01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:27.740\nYeah, sorry to listen to you.\n\n01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:29.740\nWe were successful in fighting them in the sense\n\n01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:33.020\nthat they either ran away or were killed.\n\n01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:35.060\nYeah, that was all that happened, right?\n\n01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:37.220\nBecause you set up that you were outside of the town.\n\n01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:39.500\nYeah, that's what was confusing, as I was like,\n\n01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:40.780\ndid it more happen?\n\n01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:42.540\nAnd the answer was no.\n\n01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:46.900\nSo last time, y'all found some zombies.\n\n01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:48.780\nThere was music coming from a harp,\n\n01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:54.020\nand it kind of made the zombies bummed out.\n\n01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:56.820\nThere was music bumming out the zombies and skeletons\n\n01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:58.380\nin a graveyard.\n\n01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:00.660\nAnd Diarrhea Jr. went to investigate\n\n01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:03.220\nthe sound that was the music sound.\n\n01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:06.300\nAnd when he did, there was a burst of ruby light,\n\n01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:08.220\nand then the music stopped.\n\n01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:11.740\nAnd as if on cue, the zombies stopped being all bummed out\n\n01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:16.180\nand started just being generally mindless zombies,\n\n01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:18.860\ntrying to end all life as we know it.\n\n01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:23.300\nAnd you guys, as clerics and members of the church militants,\n\n01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:25.940\nfought them and killed them.\n\n01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:27.980\nThat was it, yeah.\n\n01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:29.820\nCombat takes a long time.\n\n01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:30.700\nYeah.\n\n01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:32.740\nAll right, so where are we standing right now?\n\n01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:34.420\nYou're outside of the graveyard.\n\n01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:38.300\nYou're standing over the white ashes of the skeleton\n\n01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:41.700\nthat you cut down with your flame blade spell.\n\n01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:42.180\nAll right.\n\n01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:44.140\nThat was a fucking flame blade.\n\n01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:47.300\nYeah, that was what Chad did.\n\n01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:54.100\nSo zombies, no more music, no more zombies.\n\n01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:55.100\nWell, nighttime.\n\n01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:57.340\nLooks like we got here either just in time\n\n01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:04.580\nor when I take off my mime glasses or too late.\n\n01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:07.060\nYeah!\n\n01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:08.180\nYeah.\n\n01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:11.500\nWon't get fooled again!\n\n01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:15.060\nWell, we got here in time to kill a bunch of fucking zombies.\n\n01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:16.780\nYeah, but why are they running rampant?\n\n01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:18.580\nWhere did that music come from?\n\n01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:20.180\nI mean, who knows?\n\n01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:24.620\nThis could be, let's head into town.\n\n01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:28.340\nYou know from your knowledge of religion, yeah, that's for you.\n\n01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:28.700\nIs it?\n\n01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:30.220\nYeah, you can ask real questions.\n\n01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:33.420\nYou're playing Levy's character, right?\n\n01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:34.180\nYeah, what are you?\n\n01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:36.300\nWell, that's not what we said before the music started.\n\n01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:38.260\nWell, we can clear up anything you want.\n\n01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:39.460\nI'm here to help and answer questions.\n\n01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:41.620\nYou got to eat that mic, bro.\n\n01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:43.780\nThis is not for everyone to hear.\n\n01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:46.900\nYou got to eat that mic, bro.\n\n01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:52.020\nEat my fucking mic, Jeff.\n\n01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:53.420\nAll right, I'm eating the mic.\n\n01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:55.340\nSo what was your question?\n\n01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:58.820\nYou asked me earlier, would I like to be Steve Levy's\n\n01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:01.180\ncharacter or a new character?\n\n01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:07.180\nAnd then I said, I'd be a new game character, whatever.\n\n01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.300\nYou really gave him that option?\n\n01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:10.340\nNo, I don't think that I did.\n\n01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:11.380\nNo one gave you that option.\n\n01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:12.660\nI don't want to argue.\n\n01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:15.540\nAll right, nobody remembered having that conversation.\n\n01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:17.740\nI don't want to offer to make a new character for you.\n\n01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:18.660\nOK, whatever.\n\n01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:20.140\nWe're doing this.\n\n01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:22.740\nWe've got seven minutes.\n\n01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:26.140\nAll right, OK, so everybody just stand back.\n\n01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:28.900\nI'm going to, OK, what's this?\n\n01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:31.460\nI start kicking the bones that are in front of me.\n\n01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:32.620\nI start kicking it.\n\n01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:34.380\nI go, look at this.\n\n01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:35.500\nWhat a mess.\n\n01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:37.420\nLook at the mess you made here.\n\n01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:38.980\nThis is great.\n\n01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:39.900\nTerrific.\n\n01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:41.340\nNow what are we going to do?\n\n01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:42.100\nI'm going to play the game.\n\n01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:42.900\nWhat are we doing?\n\n01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:45.980\nOne of those war movie things where it's like a PTSD thing\n\n01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:49.700\nand I'm going to cradle him and go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\n\n01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:50.580\nListen to me, man.\n\n01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:51.900\nYou've got to look at me.\n\n01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:54.820\nThis world is magical.\n\n01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:57.700\nA lot of that magic is dark.\n\n01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:00.260\nAll right, I've been through pain.\n\n01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:01.780\nI was raised by pain.\n\n01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:03.540\nWe all met through a church.\n\n01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:04.940\nThat church ain't perfect.\n\n01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:07.460\nWe're here to clean up this town.\n\n01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.780\nCan't even remember where the fuck we're here.\n\n01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:12.500\nThat's a great question to ask.\n\n01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:13.300\nWho said that?\n\n01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:16.260\nIt was because of the, we're on the quest of Patchen's Jewel.\n\n01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:19.740\nThe quest of Patchen's gem.\n\n01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:24.780\nA third party Linux quest that wasn't approved of.\n\n01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:26.900\nWell, it was approved of.\n\n01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:27.540\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:28.780\nIt's an open source quest.\n\n01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:30.580\nYeah, I don't want to get into the minutiae.\n\n01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:31.820\nIt was very complicated.\n\n01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:34.740\nWe're on the quest of Patchen's.\n\n01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:36.380\nThe quest for Patchen's gem.\n\n01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:37.700\nPatchen's gem.\n\n01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:38.300\nYeah.\n\n01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:41.300\nPatchen's, who was your good friend and helped you out\n\n01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:45.740\nin Dome, Roan, he got robbed, in part,\n\n01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:48.460\nbecause you guys let him get stabbed a bunch.\n\n01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:50.340\nAnd we feel guilty about that, so we're\n\n01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:51.460\ngoing to go get this gem.\n\n01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:52.860\nWe're going to get the gem back.\n\n01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:54.860\nDo we have to kill some zombies along the way?\n\n01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:55.360\nYes.\n\n01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:56.140\nWe fucking did.\n\n01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:56.640\nYes.\n\n01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:01.180\nSo now it's time to put the pedal to the mother.\n\n01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:02.620\nI'm going.\n\n01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:04.700\nYou guys are, I'm going to start looking.\n\n01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:07.580\nI'm going to, I'm walking, I'm walking away.\n\n01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:08.420\nWalking towards the gem.\n\n01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:09.420\nI'll figure it out.\n\n01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:10.820\nI'll find it.\n\n01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:12.460\nI feel so bad about this, but I don't\n\n01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.980\nremember if Patchen's is with us.\n\n01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:15.020\nPatchen's is here, yeah.\n\n01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:17.180\nHe didn't, he was kind of quiet in that last fight.\n\n01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:18.180\nBut guys, here's the thing.\n\n01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:20.820\nPatchen's has been overtly critical of our ability\n\n01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:22.740\nto help him in the past, and we are not.\n\n01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:23.860\nWe've proven him right.\n\n01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:26.060\nI feel like you put me in a position\n\n01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:28.860\nwhere honesty implies brutal criticality.\n\n01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:31.180\nI don't know that I want it to be in those situations.\n\n01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:33.060\nI'm saying to my party members, I'm going,\n\n01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:40.340\nguys, if the goal is to make Patchen's go out.\n\n01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:44.220\nI think our goal is, let's keep it simple.\n\n01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:46.540\nLet's, let's help Patchen's out.\n\n01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:48.020\nLet's do one thing right.\n\n01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:48.740\nWhat?\n\n01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:51.780\nPatchen's, yeah.\n\n01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:52.620\nI have an idea.\n\n01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:53.980\nOK.\n\n01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:54.540\nHere's the thing.\n\n01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:55.860\nWe just got to a new town.\n\n01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:58.620\nThere's no direct, like, linear mission.\n\n01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:02.300\nI think what we should do is we, the only people that\n\n01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:06.060\nhave seen us together are zombies.\n\n01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:06.560\nThey're dead.\n\n01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:08.660\nThey've fled.\n\n01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:12.380\nWe should do that thing, like, in the beginning of the third,\n\n01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:14.060\nthe return of the Jedi.\n\n01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:14.660\nOK.\n\n01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:18.420\nWe show up one by one in this town.\n\n01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:21.900\nWait for everybody to take a nap.\n\n01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:23.620\nWell, don't start, like, let's not\n\n01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:27.260\nget sidetracked by our critical grievances with that movie.\n\n01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:29.860\nBut I'm just saying, like, their strategy was just like,\n\n01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:31.500\nwe just, we don't come in together.\n\n01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:33.380\nWe don't go, hey, we're the Rebel Alliance.\n\n01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:34.940\nWe're here to free Han Solo.\n\n01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:35.660\nAll right, right.\n\n01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:38.540\nLike, we, we, we just show up in different guises.\n\n01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:40.060\nJust disguising this part.\n\n01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:42.100\nAnd we, and we don't acknowledge, the only rule\n\n01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:44.900\nis we just don't acknowledge that we know each other.\n\n01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:47.620\nThe one rule is that we don't acknowledge\n\n01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:48.340\nthat we know each other.\n\n01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:50.500\nWe don't acknowledge that we know each other.\n\n01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:56.460\nUntil, until, it's time, time to make shit happen.\n\n01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:58.300\nHey, I came back.\n\n01:56:58.300 --> 01:56:58.900\nOh, boy.\n\n01:56:58.900 --> 01:56:59.700\nOh.\n\n01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:00.500\nRight.\n\n01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:01.540\nHe was off mic.\n\n01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.420\nHi.\n\n01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:04.740\nSo we're going to go into town.\n\n01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:07.780\nLet's, let's give 10 minute waits between each of us\n\n01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:08.540\nentering town.\n\n01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:09.380\nI'll go first.\n\n01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:09.860\nOK.\n\n01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:10.500\nGood.\n\n01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:12.820\nDiarrhea, you, you go in first.\n\n01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:14.060\nI'll go first.\n\n01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:15.060\nBye.\n\n01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:17.460\nDuh, just, and just, you don't know us.\n\n01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:18.500\nHold my hands up.\n\n01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:19.460\nYou don't know us.\n\n01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:20.180\nNo, blend in.\n\n01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:23.180\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah.\n\n01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:24.580\nAnd all you're going to do is just, you,\n\n01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:25.500\nyou don't have an agenda.\n\n01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:26.900\nYou're, you're not on any kind of case.\n\n01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:28.700\nYou're just going to go to a store.\n\n01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:30.660\nSure, you could go to the saloon.\n\n01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:31.540\nYou could go to the thing.\n\n01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:32.900\nI'll go to the saloon store.\n\n01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:36.460\nJust try to ingratiate yourself with locals.\n\n01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:37.100\nAll right.\n\n01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:40.260\nThe sun begins to rise as you see the outer wall of dormants.\n\n01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:42.460\nI'll take a beer.\n\n01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:44.140\nThat's the name of the town.\n\n01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:46.100\nThe outer wall.\n\n01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:48.820\nThe wall is thick and only about 10 feet high,\n\n01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:52.340\nbut it's like make, it's mostly like a big pile of like lumber\n\n01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:53.100\nand dirt and stuff.\n\n01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:54.460\nIt's kind of like a beaver dam.\n\n01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:57.780\nIt's just kind of like a big, a big mess of a big thick wall\n\n01:57:57.780 --> 01:57:59.740\nkind of surrounding the city.\n\n01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:03.140\nIt has a bit of bracing structure and kind of like a bit\n\n01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:05.580\non top that you walk on that's more flat,\n\n01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:08.140\nbut it's just kind of like a giant barricade\n\n01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:09.740\nsurrounding the whole town.\n\n01:58:09.740 --> 01:58:12.500\nYou're, you're in front of the gate and there's two guards.\n\n01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:14.100\nWell, they, they seem like they're guards,\n\n01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:16.060\nbut they're not wearing uniforms or anything.\n\n01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:17.940\nAnd they're sitting on top of the gate.\n\n01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:21.180\nYou look at them and you can tell they're sleeping.\n\n01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:24.460\nThey're sleeping on the job in the morning.\n\n01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:27.100\nHey.\n\n01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:28.420\nHey.\n\n01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:31.300\nThey slowly wake up as if out of a stupor\n\n01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:33.700\nand they, they're squinting in the sunlight\n\n01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:36.260\nand looking around, they, they, they spot you.\n\n01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:38.660\nHey, can I get in?\n\n01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:40.580\nWhat, what's your business here?\n\n01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:43.740\nI, I need to, I, there's some stuff in there I have to get.\n\n01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:44.580\nJust open the door.\n\n01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:45.420\nI gotta go.\n\n01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:46.620\nI gotta go.\n\n01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:48.540\nYou don't look like you're from around here.\n\n01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:49.380\nWhy should we let you in?\n\n01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:51.420\nNo, no, no, no, no, just open the door.\n\n01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:52.900\nI forgot my thing.\n\n01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:54.780\nYou forgot your thing?\n\n01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:58.140\nI forgot my, you know, my, what is the thing?\n\n01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.540\nI don't know what they're called.\n\n01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:01.860\nYou put it around your, your shirt.\n\n01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:03.100\nYou put it around your shirt.\n\n01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:04.100\nJust can you open it?\n\n01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:05.380\nI'm in a hurry here.\n\n01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:06.220\nRight, yeah.\n\n01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:09.580\nI'm sorry to wake you up next to the door

door.\n\n01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:16.020\nYeah, no, I get it.\n\n01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:17.820\nWe sometimes you forget your thing.\n\n01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:18.660\nThank you.\n\n01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:19.500\nOpen the door.\n\n01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:20.340\nThank you.\n\n01:59:20.340 --> 01:59:21.180\nThank you.\n\n01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:24.220\nYou can see as you walking in,\n\n01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:26.100\nthey're kind of falling back asleep.\n\n01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:28.500\nWhat the hell?\n\n01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:29.740\nWait, he got it?\n\n01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:30.740\nYeah, he got it.\n\n01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:32.740\nBut we don't know this.\n\n01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:34.740\nYou know, we don't, we didn't observe his techniques.\n\n01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:36.500\nYou didn't know, he rolled a 20.\n\n01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:37.340\nYep.\n\n01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:38.180\nOh yeah.\n\n01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:39.000\nA 20 what?\n\n01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:39.840\n20?\n\n01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:40.680\nA 20 lying.\n\n01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:43.660\nA 20 of fucking bullets.\n\n01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:45.220\nI'm going to use that.\n\n01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:46.060\nAll right.\n\n01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:48.340\nSo my plan was like, we just go individually\n\n01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:49.940\nbecause it's like, we don't, we just want to,\n\n01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:52.340\nwe just want to, we want to cast a wide net\n\n01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:54.460\nbecause I feel like our mission is infiltration.\n\n01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:55.300\nI mean,\n\n01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:57.580\nI walk up at 10 minutes later,\n\n01:59:57.580 --> 02:00:00.180\nI walk up to the guards and I go,\n\n02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:02.100\nHey, can you guys let me in?\n\n02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:03.500\nNo, they wake up.\n\n02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:08.220\nYou look like you're like a knight or something.\n\n02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:09.620\nWhat do you got?\n\n02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:10.460\nWhat are you doing?\n\n02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:15.460\nI'm just a, my friend just came through here.\n\n02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:17.900\nI'm his assistant.\n\n02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:22.020\nHe left his ID and I want to make sure he has the stuff.\n\n02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:22.860\nI'm not even staying,\n\n02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:24.580\nI just want to make sure he has his thing.\n\n02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:27.260\nThe guards follow sleep while you're talking.\n\n02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:28.100\nAll right.\n\n02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:28.940\nSo I walk through.\n\n02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:29.940\nIt's a closed door though.\n\n02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:30.780\nAll right.\n\n02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:31.900\nHow tall is the door?\n\n02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:33.060\nIt's 10 feet high.\n\n02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:34.660\nIt looks very easy to scale.\n\n02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:35.740\nI scale the door.\n\n02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:36.580\nAll right.\n\n02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:39.620\nAll right.\n\n02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:40.460\nYeah.\n\n02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:43.020\nIt's very easy to sneak past the sleeping guards.\n\n02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:44.060\nIt's, it's a,\n\n02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:45.600\nit's about like nine in the morning\n\n02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:47.180\nand they're still sleeping.\n\n02:00:47.180 --> 02:00:48.020\nYou don't know,\n\n02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:49.580\nthey seem like they might have slept\n\n02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:53.200\nthrough the night shift.\n\n02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:54.500\nI walk back.\n\n02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:59.500\nI scale back over the door and just call Carlos\n\n02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:02.300\nand say like, hey, it's easy.\n\n02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:05.660\nDon't, don't, we're not supposed to,\n\n02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:07.540\nyou're blowing your cover.\n\n02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:08.380\nOkay.\n\n02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:11.180\nI just, I get back inside.\n\n02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:12.100\nAll right.\n\n02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:12.940\nAll right.\n\n02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:14.180\nNow I, after, and then I,\n\n02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:15.620\nand then I approach the gates.\n\n02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:16.780\nThe guards are sleeping.\n\n02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:21.780\nThey wake up with a start and they grab their spears\n\n02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:24.620\nand they're like holding their spears.\n\n02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:27.140\nLike, get it, fuck off.\n\n02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:27.980\nWhat are you doing?\n\n02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:29.780\nI request entry to Dornaster\n\n02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:31.660\non a diplomatic and religious mission\n\n02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.740\nfor the church of the silver flame.\n\n02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:35.780\nThe door fee is three copper.\n\n02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:40.020\nI wonder if the church approves that fee\n\n02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:42.260\nor should it go into your local fund?\n\n02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:44.940\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:46.980\nFor the last I shall pay it.\n\n02:01:46.980 --> 02:01:47.820\nAll right.\n\n02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:49.060\nOne of the guards falls asleep\n\n02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:51.580\nand the other one, he, he holds his spear down\n\n02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:53.180\nand the spear is like holding a bucket\n\n02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:54.740\nthat you can put the money into.\n\n02:01:55.900 --> 02:02:00.460\nInteresting how weapons are adapted to commerce\n\n02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:01.880\nin times of peace.\n\n02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:05.340\nThe guard falls asleep\n\n02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:07.180\nand the bucket falls on the ground.\n\n02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:08.020\nWhoa.\n\n02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:11.220\nWake up.\n\n02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:14.900\nWait, check, see how much money's in that bucket?\n\n02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:15.740\nWhat is my-\n\n02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:16.580\nThere's only his money.\n\n02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:17.420\nThat's my money.\n\n02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:18.540\nWell, take your money back.\n\n02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:20.060\nHello.\n\n02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:21.100\nThey wake back up, huh?\n\n02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:23.900\nYou, you're so accustomed to taking bribes,\n\n02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:25.940\nyou fell asleep during it.\n\n02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:26.940\nThat sounds right.\n\n02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:27.780\nYes.\n\n02:02:27.780 --> 02:02:30.980\nPlease let me in so I can not report you to the church.\n\n02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:31.820\nAll right.\n\n02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:33.940\nJust, just go away.\n\n02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:35.540\nThey open the door.\n\n02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:37.300\nI pocket my copper.\n\n02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:38.140\nAll right, so.\n\n02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:39.140\nAnd my integrity.\n\n02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:42.500\nHey, no, just, hey, don't.\n\n02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:45.220\nI'm hiding behind the, the, the bushes.\n\n02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:48.100\nJust the idea was for us to arrive as if we were.\n\n02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:49.220\nDon't give me away.\n\n02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:50.700\nI can't, I'm not.\n\n02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:53.300\nPretty cool getting in here.\n\n02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:54.140\nHuh?\n\n02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:54.980\nYeah.\n\n02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:55.820\nThey were asleep.\n\n02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:57.420\nYeah, the idea was.\n\n02:02:57.420 --> 02:02:59.300\nAll right, so, so we're all inside now.\n\n02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:00.140\nYeah.\n\n02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:00.980\nWe're all inside.\n\n02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:03.940\nBut, and it's 10 or three, so let's.\n\n02:03:03.940 --> 02:03:06.100\nYou're clustered near the pig farm.\n\n02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:06.940\nWe're clustered.\n\n02:03:06.940 --> 02:03:09.300\nAnd the various farms.\n\n02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:11.380\nAll right, hey guys, good job getting in.\n\n02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:13.540\nHey, I guess my plan didn't work.\n\n02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:16.260\nWe just, now we're all in together and.\n\n02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:18.100\nSo we're not, we're not gonna.\n\n02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:20.020\nHowever, we're not on record with Sleeping Guards\n\n02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:21.220\nas coming as a group.\n\n02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:22.060\nThat's important.\n\n02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:22.900\nYeah.\n\n02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:23.740\nI think.\n\n02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:24.940\nAs far as, as far as they're concerned,\n\n02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:26.500\nwe were three different people.\n\n02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:29.220\nI think we should still now take advantage of that fact,\n\n02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:32.220\nthat as far as the record shows,\n\n02:03:32.220 --> 02:03:35.500\na group of church officials never came to this town.\n\n02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:36.340\nYou know?\n\n02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:36.680\nRight.\n\n02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:40.940\nSo we can now spread out, because our first,\n\n02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:42.780\nfirst thing we need to do is find information.\n\n02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:44.220\nWe need to find passion.\n\n02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:46.180\nWe gotta, we gotta find information.\n\n02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:48.300\nWe need to figure out what's going on in this town.\n\n02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:50.020\nAnd how a network of brigands.\n\n02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:53.220\nWhy is everybody so tired?\n\n02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:54.980\nA lot of sleeping.\n\n02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:56.620\nWhat time, what time of day is it Spencer?\n\n02:03:56.620 --> 02:03:58.420\nIt's about nine, maybe ten.\n\n02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:01.980\nIs there a town like Belle, like a church, like a tower?\n\n02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:04.540\nThere is a church, but it doesn't have a bell.\n\n02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:05.020\nAll right.\n\n02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:06.820\nWe got to get these people a bell.\n\n02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:10.020\nI'm going to say, you know, like,\n\n02:04:10.020 --> 02:04:15.020\nfrom this conversation forward, unless Peril demands it,\n\n02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:18.180\nwe don't acknowledge that we are part of the same.\n\n02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:22.260\nIn search of a bell.\n\n02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:25.180\nAnd we also, I'll be an emissary of the
