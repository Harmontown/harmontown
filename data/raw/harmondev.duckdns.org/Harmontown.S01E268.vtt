00:00.000 --> 00:13.480
Hello, I realized last time I did the Spencer dance wrong.

00:13.480 --> 00:20.400
From Uptown Verbank, Harmontown is now in 6th.

00:20.400 --> 00:25.160
Somebody make a meme out of that shit.

00:25.160 --> 00:26.640
You know, Spencer, where'd you go?

00:26.640 --> 00:27.920
Let's pick up our Game Master.

00:27.920 --> 00:33.920
Spencer Crittenden with his bag of holding.

00:33.920 --> 00:36.440
What you got in that bag?

00:36.440 --> 00:39.080
Books, books, books and dice.

00:39.080 --> 00:43.640
Gonna play D&D, gonna go real nice.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.080
What you got in that sack?

00:46.080 --> 00:48.520
Just some games and a shit to get back on.

00:48.520 --> 00:52.120
Is it true that you're going to roll some dice?

00:52.120 --> 00:53.040
It's true, man.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.880
It's true that I got head lice.

00:55.880 --> 01:00.320
That's a parasite on your head.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.760
You should see a doctor.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.760
Let's bring up your mayor, Dan Harmon.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.360
The beat rolls through me.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.120
I'm an artist.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.480
I'm a poet.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.080
I fucked your mama and she didn't even know it.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.280
I'm a stealth fucker.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.520
I roll in, got bad luck or something.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.880
When I go in, I've got a tiny little wiener

01:29.880 --> 01:32.360
so she didn't know.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.920
It's like a cave.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.640
Hear me blow.

01:35.640 --> 01:38.160
Yo, echo.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.800
It's not your mama's pissies.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.000
It's the problem.

01:42.000 --> 01:42.880
Boy, oh boy.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.840
You guys threw me because.

01:45.840 --> 01:46.880
No, no, no.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.200
That sounded accusatory.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.920
That sounded blamful and shameful.

01:50.920 --> 01:54.880
I'm just saying my rap is more shameful than it would have been

01:54.880 --> 02:01.960
if I hadn't been overshadowed by professional rappers,

02:01.960 --> 02:02.640
Rachel Maddow.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.520
Do a rap as Rachel Maddow.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.720
All right.

02:10.720 --> 02:15.960
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.200
I got a long neck and my head's in the stars.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.480
Rachel Maddow coming at you tonight.

02:22.480 --> 02:26.440
I got some left-leaning news to make you feel all right.

02:26.440 --> 02:30.560
In spite of Nazis taking over the USA,

02:30.560 --> 02:33.000
I'm popular and not because I'm gay.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
It's just the reason you can trust me.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.640
Don't fuck with me.

02:38.640 --> 02:44.960
I got a really long neck so I can see better than you.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.480
What's going on?

02:48.480 --> 02:50.360
Rachel Maddow.

02:50.360 --> 02:51.840
I haven't watched her in a while.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.160
Wait, OK.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.680
Hello, Zach.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.120
Zac McKeever on.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.520
Did I just out Rachel Maddow?

02:58.520 --> 03:01.800
Well, you certainly added her as having a long neck.

03:01.800 --> 03:02.720
No, people know that.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.520
And she celebrates it, I think, with her.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.680
If you were ashamed of your very long neck,

03:07.680 --> 03:10.040
you would not wear what Rachel Maddow wears.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.760
This is not me objectifying her.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.440
I think you're certainly neck-shaming.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.200
I think he's neck-celebrating.

03:17.200 --> 03:21.040
Like I believe she is, I'm neck-celebrating.

03:21.040 --> 03:25.240
Now we've learned from her what the next thing that happens

03:25.240 --> 03:28.960
is that Rachel is doing an AMA and somebody says,

03:28.960 --> 03:31.440
Dan Harmon says you have a shamefully long neck

03:31.440 --> 03:34.320
and that you dress like you should be ashamed.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.680
What are your comments on that?

03:35.680 --> 03:37.480
And then we're beefing.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.880
Oh, well, now we're beefing.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.920
Beefing with Maddow.

03:40.920 --> 03:41.880
Beefing with me.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.480
Now we're in a reservoir of dogs crossfire

03:44.480 --> 03:48.040
with Ron Jeremy and Rachel Maddow.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.320
Anyways, that's the danger of opening your show with rapping.

03:54.320 --> 03:58.760
But I've found that opening the show with a little freestyle

03:58.760 --> 04:01.880
gets my energy up.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.120
It's a classic improv.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.760
It would be the sound of thunderous applause.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.720
Do you have a burp in the chamber right now, Dan?

04:10.720 --> 04:13.080
Can you do a word burp?

04:13.080 --> 04:15.720
Yes.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.840
Well, there it goes.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.920
Because Church and I do a lot of word burping.

04:18.920 --> 04:22.400
And we try to get Steve Agee to do a thing where he just burps

04:22.400 --> 04:23.440
words.

04:23.440 --> 04:28.440
And it's hard to do multi-syllabic word burps.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.280
And one burp, I want it.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.520
If you can pull this off, you'll be my hero.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.840
If you can word burp, White House AIDS.

04:38.840 --> 04:44.440
I have to swallow air.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.440
White House AIDS.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.920
No.

04:48.920 --> 04:53.800
AIDS had a little bit of vomit drop coming up on it.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.840
Yeah, I haven't done that in a while.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.440
Just once can someone burp women's rights.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.280
For God's sake.

05:00.280 --> 05:04.280
Try to burp women's rights.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.680
Well, how have you guys been?

05:05.680 --> 05:06.880
We had a Thanksgiving weekend.

05:06.880 --> 05:07.760
What did you guys do?

05:07.760 --> 05:08.960
Let's start with Spencer.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.800
I went to Dino's.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.080
Yeah, it was good.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.560
I wanted to make a recipe to bring there.

05:15.560 --> 05:21.880
But then I decided to just bring Coke, not the drug, the drink.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.960
And it went over really well.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.720
People were like, man, I love this party.

05:26.720 --> 05:30.600
But the only thing to drink is hard liquor and wine.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.040
And then I was like, I got you.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.480
And then people were digging it.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.640
And I was like, yeah, this is the right move.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.080
He made a lot of good food.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.560
It was good.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.200
There wasn't a lot of crazy people there,

05:40.200 --> 05:41.560
which there are occasionally.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.640
So it was a real fun time.

05:43.640 --> 05:47.240
What do you feel about his garlic levels as a chef?

05:47.240 --> 05:49.080
They're high, but that's what I like.

05:49.080 --> 05:52.280
I'd say the garlic levels in the Thanksgiving dinner

05:52.280 --> 05:54.440
were lower than normal.

05:54.440 --> 05:58.320
Dino usually makes Greek food to go with the Thanksgiving

05:58.320 --> 05:58.600
food.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.640
So he'll make a turkey.

05:59.640 --> 06:03.280
And then he'll make some crazy beef stew stuff.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.120
And he didn't really have any of that.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.080
It was just traditional Thanksgiving stuff,

06:07.080 --> 06:08.120
which I was thankful for.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.840
I mean, I like Greek food, but Thanksgiving.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.560
Yeah.

06:13.560 --> 06:14.060
Dan?

06:14.060 --> 06:14.560
Jeffrey?

06:14.560 --> 06:16.200
Yeah, let's go to you.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.040
Oh, me?

06:17.040 --> 06:20.200
I went to Florida with Cody and visited with my parents,

06:20.200 --> 06:24.320
which is I haven't been down to Florida in a long time

06:24.320 --> 06:25.360
to visit the parents.

06:25.360 --> 06:32.040
And our main activity was Balderdash, which is like,

06:32.040 --> 06:37.520
my family is like, we walk a razor's edge as a tribe.

06:37.520 --> 06:43.520
Like, we're not, we don't have unconditional love.

06:43.520 --> 06:47.200
Like, love is, in the Harmon family,

06:47.200 --> 06:52.120
it's a loose knit alliance of nefarious bounty hunters who

06:52.120 --> 06:58.680
are all just trying to make sure that the galaxy doesn't

06:58.680 --> 07:00.120
get plunged into war.

07:00.120 --> 07:06.640
But it's, and so if you break out monopoly or trivial pursuit,

07:06.640 --> 07:08.320
you could be asking for trouble.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.600
How big was the squad?

07:09.600 --> 07:10.760
It was you and Cody and the parents?

07:10.760 --> 07:11.760
Just the four of us.

07:11.760 --> 07:12.240
Really?

07:12.240 --> 07:12.760
Yeah.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.680
And but Balderdash, I've found for my family,

07:16.680 --> 07:18.520
is this just amazing.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.640
It's every man for himself.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.200
No, that's an outdated expression, sorry.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.520
Two of them were women that were out for themselves.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.480
Ladies, be out for yourselves.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.160
Thank God they finally got that message

07:31.160 --> 07:35.040
from someone they could trust.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.280
But Balderdash is like, there's no teams.

07:37.280 --> 07:42.360
And there's also, any time pressure is self-imposed.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.240
We decided after a while, let's take no longer than two minutes

07:45.240 --> 07:46.600
to write an answer.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.680
Refresh my memory.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.360
Balderdash is what you lie about a thing.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.400
You have to figure out who's telling the truth.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.480
Do they give you one real definition?

07:56.480 --> 07:58.480
Or you've got to, there's a word and you

07:58.480 --> 07:59.960
have to guess the definition.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.320
Well, I think I can, just knowing what Jeff knows,

08:02.320 --> 08:05.480
I think I can explain it fast to him

08:05.480 --> 08:08.440
by saying it's basically the Leonard Malton movie guide

08:08.440 --> 08:09.240
game.

08:09.240 --> 08:12.480
But there's five more categories than movies.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.360
And you can just, the way we play it,

08:14.360 --> 08:15.240
you can just pick movies.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.080
So it could be a definition of a word.

08:17.080 --> 08:17.720
Right.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.200
So there's acronyms.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.640
So there'll just be a jumble of letters.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.760
That's my least favorite one, because I feel like I'm doing

08:22.760 --> 08:23.320
homework.

08:23.320 --> 08:26.920
I just feel like I'm not, it's not about creativity.

08:26.920 --> 08:32.400
It's just like I-H-C. And then the people just

08:32.400 --> 08:36.400
write, International Housing Committee of, you know,

08:36.400 --> 08:38.560
I hate tarp.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.760
And the cool thing, the genius of Balderdash,

08:44.760 --> 08:47.320
as far as the actual publishers of the game,

08:47.320 --> 08:52.960
what they really did write, in my opinion, is they clearly,

08:52.960 --> 08:54.040
there's real answers.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.160
There's one real answer on the, you know, I-H-C

08:57.160 --> 09:00.120
does stand for something in the real world out there

09:00.120 --> 09:03.120
somewhere.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.280
But also, there's all these movies that no one's ever seen.

09:06.280 --> 09:14.800
So the title will be like, Blue Marble Babies.

09:14.800 --> 09:18.920
And there's some movie out there called Blue Marble Babies.

09:18.920 --> 09:22.560
You don't know if it's like Dollywood or Bollywood.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.120
Or Dollywood.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.640
But maybe, I think they've started to greenlight

09:25.640 --> 09:28.920
more projects this fiscal quarter.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.120
We're pulling for Dollywood.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.920
I don't know if they're going to catch up to Bollywood.

09:31.920 --> 09:35.440
But you don't know where it's from.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.480
You just know that there is a movie out there called

09:37.480 --> 09:39.600
The Blue Marble Babies.

09:39.600 --> 09:42.320
The genius of the Balderdash publishers

09:42.320 --> 09:48.760
is that whoever they had write the real answer, which might be,

09:48.760 --> 09:52.640
it's a log line for the movie Blue Marble Babies.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.800
And then they have the people that write them,

09:54.800 --> 10:03.680
they write them in kind of a fucking Schrab.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.120
Schrab.is here.

10:06.120 --> 10:06.680
Yeah.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.360
I let him in.

10:14.420 --> 10:16.160
Hello, Rob.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.320
Happy Thanksgiving, Rob.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.400
Thank you.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.000
There's no camera over here, right?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.800
There's no churches again.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.440
No, there's not.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.600
You don't want to disrupt.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.840
There's no.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.040
This isn't about you.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.240
Jeff, I was trying.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.280
I couldn't find it anyway.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.160
I was looking, though.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.520
Maybe you will have better luck.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.320
We were trying to find the Balder Dash game

10:39.320 --> 10:41.560
so we could play it live on stage.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.920
I thought it was something that we could do around tonight

10:44.920 --> 10:45.480
to test it.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.080
But I really actually think it'd be really funny.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.400
I think that Benson basically plays the Lunnert

10:49.400 --> 10:52.840
Malton movie game on his movie podcast.

10:52.840 --> 10:53.560
Getting Doug.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.360
No.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.920
No, Doug loves movies.

10:56.920 --> 10:57.400
OK.

10:57.400 --> 10:57.880
Sorry.

10:57.880 --> 10:58.760
I got it mixed up.

10:58.760 --> 10:59.240
Doesn't matter.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.480
It's a different podcast network.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.280
We don't care if they live or die.

11:02.280 --> 11:06.280
And to tell you the truth, if it was a choice between them dying

11:06.280 --> 11:10.160
and us saving some bread for, I don't know,

11:10.160 --> 11:14.280
Cameron Esposito or one of our tribe,

11:14.280 --> 11:16.800
like what are we supposed to do, you know?

11:16.800 --> 11:19.400
Kill or be killed in the podcast wars.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.640
Valuable Warby Parker dollars are being battled over.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.000
So Dan, it was you, Cody, your mom and your dad,

11:26.000 --> 11:30.320
stuck in the confines of Florida.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.520
And how'd it go?

11:31.520 --> 11:32.040
It was great.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.080
It was really great.

11:33.080 --> 11:36.560
And my parents have a little tiny electric boat.

11:36.560 --> 11:41.840
They live in a neighborhood of, wait, they have an electric boat?

11:41.840 --> 11:43.880
Yeah, my parents moved, or Wisconsinites

11:43.880 --> 11:45.400
that moved to Florida.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.960
That's the dream of every Wisconsinite.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.360
You don't go to California because California

11:50.360 --> 11:56.120
has drugs, foreign people, and is going to fall into the sea.

11:56.120 --> 12:00.320
That's what Florida is perfect for, yeah.

12:00.320 --> 12:07.400
A drug-free, all-American, totally globally shielded,

12:07.400 --> 12:12.480
absolutely no natural disasters imminent.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.920
But it's all about boat culture there.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.800
My parents moved into a little neighborhood

12:16.800 --> 12:19.800
that's kind of upper-middle-class retirement

12:19.800 --> 12:25.720
suburb with, although I don't know if that's true anymore,

12:25.720 --> 12:31.400
so savior flame wars when you fact-check this.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.360
But there's canals.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.200
There's neighborhoods of Florida where everyone has

12:36.200 --> 12:39.080
a canal in their backyard instead of an alley,

12:39.080 --> 12:40.680
where you'd have an alley because you're

12:40.680 --> 12:45.360
a dirty, urban, horrible break dancer.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.760
You have streets.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.840
I've been accused of that before.

12:48.840 --> 12:54.040
And then the non-address facing conduit is an alley.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.640
Only instead of crackpipes, there's manatee.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.600
How do we play Balder Dash live right now?

12:59.600 --> 13:04.280
We would have to find a Balder Dash set of cards.

13:04.280 --> 13:09.320
Just any card from any Balder Dash

13:09.320 --> 13:12.280
or just a movie title.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.800
If you at home have one, take a picture of it

13:14.800 --> 13:17.520
and send it to the Harmontown Twitter.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.080
We can play it.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.680
We'll play it with our guest when he's like,

13:20.680 --> 13:22.000
we can try to figure it out.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.480
Let's make an action item, OK?

13:24.480 --> 13:28.680
If somebody out there in our crowdsourcing community

13:28.680 --> 13:31.200
can isolate, let's say, a Balder Dash

13:31.200 --> 13:37.320
card such that we can see a question side

13:37.320 --> 13:38.480
and an answer side for it.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.680
Only we can see it, but the crowd can't see it?

13:40.680 --> 13:42.360
No, the crowd can see it.

13:42.360 --> 13:43.800
We won't be able to see it.

13:43.800 --> 13:44.880
I got you.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.400
So I would say let's just make that an action item

13:47.400 --> 13:52.320
and then maybe our crew can, if somebody like,

13:52.320 --> 13:54.280
because otherwise I'll just be talking about it all night.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.760
Well, OK, let's put that out into the ether.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.400
But how did you get along with your mom and dad?

13:59.400 --> 14:00.400
How did that all go down?

14:00.400 --> 14:01.840
Was it healing?

14:01.840 --> 14:04.240
I wouldn't say it was healing, but I would say it was triumphant.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.160
We didn't really fight that much.

14:06.160 --> 14:09.240
Like, I had one flare up with my mom at a restaurant dinner.

14:09.240 --> 14:16.560
And then I, like, steamed and, you know, stewed and, like,

14:16.560 --> 14:20.240
I didn't, we kind of, that night got lost.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.520
Like, we didn't, we, like, went to dinner.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.600
And then following that dinner, I went back to the hotel.

14:25.600 --> 14:29.000
And I just kind of fumed into a drink at the hotel bar

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
and had Cody, you know, there as my partner.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.800
But, like, she wasn't, like, taking sides or anything.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.440
So it was just, like, I needed, I needed space.

14:37.440 --> 14:38.520
I needed time.

14:38.520 --> 14:41.360
And then the next morning, it's fine.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.960
You know, who wants to keep fighting?

14:42.960 --> 14:43.440
Nobody does.

14:43.440 --> 14:46.560
Did Cody enjoy your parents?

14:46.560 --> 14:48.040
Yeah, she loves them.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.040
And vice versa.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.560
She, yeah, she thinks they're great.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.720
She comes from a family where it's like,

14:52.720 --> 14:57.800
Cody has a childhood memory of, or that her,

14:57.800 --> 15:00.640
it's this thing that her mom would do regularly.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.240
When Cody would take a bath, her mom,

15:03.240 --> 15:07.440
Randy Heller, Mama LaRusso from the Karate Kid,

15:07.440 --> 15:10.120
says not why she's a valuable mother at all.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.600
But it arguably gets in the way of a conditional love

15:12.600 --> 15:15.440
to have a professional actor as a mother.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.240
It doesn't hurt to know that your mom was in Karate Kid.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.200
Doesn't hurt me.

15:20.200 --> 15:24.720
I mean, I have become functionally a step Karate Kid.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.120
You don't, you don't, make no mistake about it.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.120
This is part of the package for me.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.880
I didn't learn unconditional love.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.640
I'm motivated by other things.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.320
I love Cody.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.840
Part of what I love about Cody is that I get to be a step

15:37.840 --> 15:38.760
Karate Kid.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.400
Anyways.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.360
But no.

15:41.360 --> 15:45.400
She was also Rizzo on Broadway in Greece, wasn't she?

15:45.400 --> 15:47.560
Yeah, she was also, I didn't, I, her,

15:47.560 --> 15:51.080
she was, most people recognize her on the street

15:51.080 --> 15:53.680
when that happens as her character that she played

15:53.680 --> 15:58.520
a madman, she was Don Draper's secretary for a season.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.520
Shit.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.560
This show isn't about fucking Randy Heller, all right?

16:03.560 --> 16:04.680
It could be.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.640
She's got enough attention.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.600
But she was also a loving mother.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.160
And what she would do, like, Cody has this, like,

16:12.160 --> 16:13.760
it's not even a story, it's not an anecdote,

16:13.760 --> 16:16.000
it's a tradition that her mom had with Cody.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.160
Cody would take a bath.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.640
And then after the bath was done,

16:18.640 --> 16:20.800
Cody would get out of the bath, her mom would,

16:20.800 --> 16:25.800
would wrap her up in a big towel and then wrap her up

16:25.800 --> 16:28.680
in a big blanket, like a comforter.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.960
And then her, and her mom would start dragging her

16:31.960 --> 16:37.360
around the house inside the comforter saying,

16:37.360 --> 16:40.320
I got a wild fish here, I got a wild fish.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.360
And she would do this elaborate, like,

16:43.360 --> 16:47.520
radio play for baby Cody, who was, like,

16:47.520 --> 16:50.880
just cocooned in this comforter, being dragged around,

16:50.880 --> 16:54.040
hardwood floors, around an apartment.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.160
And while her mom pretended that she was passing

16:57.160 --> 16:59.880
various checkpoints and lying about whether she

16:59.880 --> 17:04.720
had a wild fish with her, so she would do different voices.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.840
No, sir, I don't have any wildlife or agriculture

17:08.840 --> 17:12.520
in my comforter, I just, just a bag and, like,

17:12.520 --> 17:16.000
trying to keep her quiet, keep her from giggling.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.800
Look, this isn't about, let's bag on the Harmons,

17:18.800 --> 17:21.080
this is about contrast.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.880
My memories are the water would get cold after a while

17:23.880 --> 17:27.960
and I would find my way out and go roll in pine needles.

17:27.960 --> 17:32.800
All right, they're important.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.880
So what age did I stop bathing?

17:35.880 --> 17:38.360
No.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.320
I don't know, when was my first bath?

17:40.320 --> 17:43.640
So what age did Cody's mom do the wild fish thing?

17:43.640 --> 17:45.800
Like 15.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.520
27, yeah.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.800
We did it together, she handed it,

17:49.800 --> 17:52.000
it was like a passing of the baton.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.440
I don't know, I don't know that answer.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.960
You and your mom and your dad didn't

17:54.960 --> 17:56.800
have any kind of heritage like that?

17:56.800 --> 18:00.320
Like you didn't have special little fun games?

18:00.320 --> 18:04.840
Hmm, I can't, no.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.520
Rob Sharpe just yelled out Tiki, which was a nickname

18:07.520 --> 18:08.680
that I had.

18:08.680 --> 18:09.240
Tiki?

18:09.240 --> 18:10.440
Yeah, I don't know.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.920
Why Tiki?

18:11.920 --> 18:14.520
It was a favorite childhood story of mine, Tiki, Tiki,

18:14.520 --> 18:16.160
Timbo.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.240
Oh, man.

18:17.240 --> 18:17.920
God damn it.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.960
We heard about that on Whiting Longs,

18:19.960 --> 18:21.320
the Thanksgiving special.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.040
Oh, yeah.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.920
Which you can check out on iTunes.

18:23.920 --> 18:24.560
Yeah.

18:24.560 --> 18:29.840
I feel like we should bring Rob Sharpe up on stage right now.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.800
Well, we also have an important guest.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.080
It's been a long time coming, because remember,

18:34.080 --> 18:36.880
since the election, my goal has been to,

18:36.880 --> 18:40.600
because I don't know what I'm doing, and I have a forum.

18:40.600 --> 18:45.160
And I immediately had reactions that were both predictable,

18:45.160 --> 18:48.200
unhelpful, and ultimately unguiding.

18:48.200 --> 18:53.360
I got mad at everybody and bought a gun,

18:53.360 --> 18:55.960
and have since basically been trying

18:55.960 --> 19:00.200
to focus on quitting all my jobs and building a Batcave

19:00.200 --> 19:02.120
with a crossbow aimed at the door.

19:02.120 --> 19:06.640
But in the meantime, I've wanted to use my platform,

19:06.640 --> 19:11.480
if I could, to signal boost the whole spectrum.

19:11.480 --> 19:16.600
The only step I've taken was we flew Gotham Girl out

19:16.600 --> 19:19.760
from New York, and she, I think, I don't know

19:19.760 --> 19:21.280
if she would want to be called.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.880
I don't know what label she'd want to be called.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.200
She calls herself an Eleanor Democrat in her bio.

19:25.200 --> 19:30.560
She talked about, you know, it's important.

19:30.560 --> 19:33.840
It was important to hear from an intelligent person's

19:33.840 --> 19:37.520
perspective, like, basically, don't give up on what we would

19:37.520 --> 19:39.000
call the old Democratic Party.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.360
You know, let's hack it the way that the Nazis have hacked

19:42.360 --> 19:45.040
the right wing, the Republican Party.

19:45.040 --> 19:48.200
I mean, they infiltrated it, took it over,

19:48.200 --> 19:52.880
and now the word Republican means I want to win.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.560
It didn't mean much before that, but it's like,

19:54.560 --> 19:56.600
and I think the idea is, like, come on,

19:56.600 --> 20:01.360
we can still use this shell of a Democratic Party, hack it,

20:01.360 --> 20:03.920
drive it from the inside, because it has the numbers

20:03.920 --> 20:07.360
and the systemic advantage that it's the only thing that

20:07.360 --> 20:10.320
can rock and sock them, that robot.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.360
So now let's hear, maybe, I would assume,

20:12.360 --> 20:14.800
maybe another perspective, but I want to definitely

20:14.800 --> 20:17.920
be clear that this, we wanted to have somebody from the DSA

20:17.920 --> 20:20.240
on, the Democratic Socialists of America,

20:20.240 --> 20:25.080
and, but we, this is a guy who's a member of them.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.720
He's not a, he doesn't represent them as a leader

20:27.720 --> 20:29.240
or anything, he's not a spokesman.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.520
He's already, we'll talk about how he's already,

20:31.520 --> 20:34.880
he resigned from his position as an official spokesman

20:34.880 --> 20:39.800
because of a little, like, a little gridlock,

20:39.800 --> 20:42.640
little cultural gridlock, comedic cultural gridlock

20:42.640 --> 20:44.480
that happened where he did the smart thing

20:44.480 --> 20:46.520
and, like, backed out as being a representative.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.320
So, but, what he is, is a guy who understands

20:49.320 --> 20:51.040
that perspective, which I think is different

20:51.040 --> 20:52.280
from the other one that we've gotten.

20:52.280 --> 20:55.760
And we tried, we tried to get the official spokesperson

20:55.760 --> 20:59.600
officially sanctioned by a local chapter of the DSA,

20:59.600 --> 21:02.360
and we tried for multiple months,

21:02.360 --> 21:05.240
I want to say four or five in total,

21:05.240 --> 21:07.960
and then we took matters into our own hands

21:07.960 --> 21:09.560
and just were like, hey, this guy,

21:09.560 --> 21:11.960
I think he knows something, let's get him.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.160
Like the socialist activists that we are,

21:14.160 --> 21:15.360
we took matters in our own hands.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.120
But I don't know whose fault that is.

21:17.120 --> 21:17.960
That could be-

21:17.960 --> 21:19.880
It's their fault, and if they want to be taken seriously

21:19.880 --> 21:23.240
as a political group, they should get on their shit.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.880
Do we know for sure that Levy isn't secretly-

21:24.880 --> 21:26.360
I'm going to take that stand.

21:26.360 --> 21:29.560
Well, I'll take that stand and I'll take the stand

21:29.560 --> 21:32.560
that Steve has been cock-blocking them from day one

21:32.560 --> 21:36.040
as the alt-right subversive insurgent that he is.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.040
Okay, good.

21:37.040 --> 21:44.560
Well, let's bring up our new friend, Josh Androwski.

21:44.560 --> 21:47.400
Oh, yeah.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.720
He's got two cans.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.400
Hi.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.120
Hello, Josh.

21:56.120 --> 21:56.400
How are you?

21:56.400 --> 21:57.320
How are you?

21:57.320 --> 21:58.080
Good to see you.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.760
Now I feel bad I didn't shake Spencer's hand.

22:00.760 --> 22:01.960
You got some lacrosse there?

22:01.960 --> 22:02.720
Yeah, I do.

22:02.720 --> 22:03.720
I guess to me, we are.

22:03.720 --> 22:04.680
Yeah.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.640
You came up double fisting some lacrosse.

22:06.640 --> 22:09.760
I quit drinking, and I know this podcast well enough

22:09.760 --> 22:13.080
to know that there would be no non-alcoholic beverages.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.520
Right, just like Dino's party.

22:15.520 --> 22:18.280
It's taking matters into your own hands.

22:18.280 --> 22:21.240
Spencer did the, I don't know if he did it out of fashion

22:21.240 --> 22:25.320
or climate control, but you walked in

22:25.320 --> 22:28.400
and you were wearing the same shirt.

22:28.400 --> 22:33.080
Socialists prove that white people do have culture.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.160
I thought you were just going to say socialist dressed

22:35.160 --> 22:35.960
like Spencer.

22:35.960 --> 22:36.760
Yeah, no, we do.

22:36.760 --> 22:38.200
We all like.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.280
That's the subtext.

22:40.280 --> 22:46.400
So people can Google and they can Wikipedia and stuff.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.840
I Wikipediaed and Googled for the 11-minute drive

22:49.840 --> 22:53.400
from Los Feliz to Burbank.

22:53.400 --> 22:57.440
Here's what you can learn by reading and scrolling.

22:57.440 --> 23:01.920
The DSA was once a part of the IS, the International

23:01.920 --> 23:03.920
Socialist, or Socialist International

23:03.920 --> 23:05.840
SI, Sports Illustrated.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.200
They were both Sports Illustrated.

23:08.200 --> 23:11.640
Our swimsuit issue was really revolutionary.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.120
We had one swimsuit for all the models.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.160
It was Betty Friedan wearing a burka.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.120
Yeah, it was.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.240
They're all wearing gas masks.

23:18.240 --> 23:19.880
It was Frida Kahlo designed it.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.920
It was incredible.

23:21.920 --> 23:24.880
But there was a split in 82.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.480
We now call the DSA voted to extricate themselves

23:28.480 --> 23:31.800
from the larger global socialists.

23:31.800 --> 23:35.760
Basically, none of that shit matters at all.

23:35.760 --> 23:39.080
The history and what I mean to say is, I don't know.

23:39.080 --> 23:39.560
Oh, OK.

23:39.560 --> 23:43.480
Because the DSA fundamentally transformed

23:43.480 --> 23:44.640
during the last election.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.640
Right, it's now what it is.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.400
But it's important to note, for instance,

23:48.400 --> 23:50.440
that it's not a political party, right?

23:50.440 --> 23:50.800
No.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.040
You don't have a candidate.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.200
Right, so we're not a political party in the sense

23:55.200 --> 23:56.800
that we're not going to fall.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.600
And hopefully, this is what people have worked towards.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.880
And my friends and myself have worked towards.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.680
We don't want to fall into the trapping of the Green Party,

24:04.680 --> 24:08.960
where you just every four years trot out somebody that

24:08.960 --> 24:13.000
is like whatever, just a person, good or bad.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.080
And then it's like every four years, you're like, hey,

24:15.080 --> 24:17.560
let's change everything from the president down.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.560
Because nobody knows who the fuck we are.

24:19.560 --> 24:20.280
Exactly.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.720
Well, also, it just falls apart.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.560
Like, you just can't.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.600
If we have a problem with the way the system has been run,

24:27.600 --> 24:30.200
part of the problem is that there's just some knucklehead

24:30.200 --> 24:33.600
who supposedly is supposed to not offend everybody every minute

24:33.600 --> 24:34.120
of every day.

24:34.120 --> 24:37.680
And supposedly that the president,

24:37.680 --> 24:40.400
I think Donald Trump has proven more than anything

24:40.400 --> 24:42.760
that the president doesn't really do that much,

24:42.760 --> 24:47.000
that the president is more of a figurehead right now.

24:47.000 --> 24:47.840
He certainly can't.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.360
What we do know about that office

24:49.360 --> 24:52.520
is that you can't blow up the world from it

24:52.520 --> 24:54.600
within less than a year.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.760
Right, which like.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.200
Makes it relatively less powerful than, let's say,

24:58.200 --> 24:59.400
the head of Al-Qaeda.

24:59.400 --> 25:04.480
Yeah, or a general, like an unelected person

25:04.480 --> 25:06.120
in our government.

25:06.120 --> 25:10.560
And so what we have done as far as the idea of like,

25:10.560 --> 25:14.080
are we a political party or not, in local elections,

25:14.080 --> 25:15.240
that's where we're focusing.

25:15.240 --> 25:19.960
We truly think, you were talking about how it's like the big

25:19.960 --> 25:22.560
robot fight, like the Pacific Rim between the Democrats

25:22.560 --> 25:24.040
and the Republicans or whatever.

25:24.040 --> 25:27.200
We're the little land speeders tying their likes together,

25:27.200 --> 25:27.760
you know?

25:27.760 --> 25:30.720
Like, if.

25:30.720 --> 25:31.220
Yes.

25:31.220 --> 25:32.640
This is Rob Schrab.

25:32.640 --> 25:33.560
Snow speeder.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.000
We're the little snow speeders, fuck.

25:35.000 --> 25:35.760
I ruined it.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.320
Nobody likes the GSA anymore, because I

25:37.320 --> 25:39.280
fucked up a Star Wars reference.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.960
This is bad.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.960
No, no, I don't think that's what.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.880
Oh, you said, oh, he said land speeders and you're correcting him.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.720
Wow, I'm catching up.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.840
Jesus Christ.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.520
Schrab, by the way, is that little black box

25:52.520 --> 25:55.480
that Chewbacca scared on the Death Star?

25:55.480 --> 25:57.040
Only there's no Chewbacca's here.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.600
What was the whole Death Star out of the black box?

25:59.600 --> 26:03.240
What was the name of that little droid?

26:03.240 --> 26:04.960
I'm guessing you're asking, because you know.

26:04.960 --> 26:05.560
I don't know.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.920
Oh.

26:06.920 --> 26:07.600
Oh, wow.

26:07.600 --> 26:11.840
It's 4, 20, 69.

26:11.840 --> 26:15.240
4, 20, 69, but I can never forget.

26:15.240 --> 26:19.000
All right, but yeah, but that's important to know,

26:19.000 --> 26:22.120
because right away, to me, it's like, because I mean,

26:22.120 --> 26:25.880
you backed, I'm saying you, like you're this whole group,

26:25.880 --> 26:30.720
but you pick a candidate in these big fights.

26:30.720 --> 26:34.240
Sure, well, traditionally no, but in this last election,

26:34.240 --> 26:38.800
yes, with Bernie, because Bernie was the only candidate that

26:38.800 --> 26:45.320
was left of the centrist opinion who actually had a shot.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.840
And so I wasn't with them during that period,

26:47.840 --> 26:51.960
but I know that they were like, hey, let's backburn.

26:51.960 --> 26:55.200
But for me, and the way that I got into the DSA

26:55.200 --> 26:58.600
is I was sick and tired.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.200
I was always the guy when the bad shit would happen,

27:01.200 --> 27:03.120
that I would be the first guy out to protest.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.400
I would be the first person out to do a benefit show

27:05.400 --> 27:06.480
about the bad thing.

27:06.480 --> 27:10.080
And I was sick and tired of reacting to all the bad shit.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.600
And I was like, well, how do you stop the bad shit

27:12.600 --> 27:13.760
from happening?

27:13.760 --> 27:16.320
And I thought, I'm one guy.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.280
I'm not a billionaire.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.800
And I'm not like Timothy Comcast with access

27:20.800 --> 27:22.440
to all the resources in the world.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.400
That little prick.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.760
Yeah, fucking Timothy Comcast.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.680
Has not earned his position as CEO of Comcast at all.

27:27.680 --> 27:28.180
Obviously.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.080
Clearly nepotism.

27:29.080 --> 27:29.520
Oh, clearly.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.360
I mean, there's no way that's a coincidence.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.040
No.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.840
No, I know he says he spells it with a K,

27:33.840 --> 27:35.320
but we all know he's fucking talking.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.080
He looks just like his dad.

27:38.080 --> 27:40.560
He's got the antenna and the blinking light on his forehead.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.240
Yeah.

27:42.240 --> 27:47.160
So I saw that the DSA was doing stuff locally.

27:47.160 --> 27:51.080
And the idea that we all fight in all these similar battles.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.160
Everybody's fighting for better housing,

27:53.160 --> 27:57.680
for better medicine to treat oppressed groups,

27:57.680 --> 27:58.920
like human beings.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.600
We all have these fights locally within our own communities.

28:02.600 --> 28:06.240
And so if every city bands together

28:06.240 --> 28:10.400
and topples their local Trump, then that

28:10.400 --> 28:12.240
will lead to a domino effect.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.400
Because there's Trumps everywhere.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.040
And oftentimes, they're way funnier and crazier

28:17.040 --> 28:17.960
than the actual Trump.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.440
Because they don't think anyone's looking at them.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.920
And so it's all about.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.280
That's like probably local wrestling franchises

28:24.280 --> 28:27.200
are like way more crazy than WCW or whatever.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.040
Yeah, like the ECW, where they were just.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.800
Is that guy really staring to the sun, man?

28:31.800 --> 28:33.840
Is that guy dancing queen?

28:33.840 --> 28:35.640
He's the Abba-themed wrestler?

28:35.640 --> 28:36.840
The outlet forker.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.160
This seems irresponsible.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.880
But that's District 12.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.680
Watch out for running with scissors, man.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.280
Hey, kids, running out there.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.120
Grab those scissors.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.360
Left-handed, right-handed.

28:46.360 --> 28:47.080
Run with them.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.040
You've got to run free.

28:48.040 --> 28:49.720
Don't let people make you walk with scissors.

28:49.720 --> 28:50.760
You've got to stare in the sun.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.280
You've got to put those scissors in an outlet.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.560
Hua!

28:53.560 --> 28:55.440
And his catchphrase is Hua?

28:55.440 --> 28:56.960
That's actually his entire catchphrase.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.600
He says that every time.

28:58.600 --> 29:01.200
Well, he's army.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.920
Yeah, or he's scent of a woman derivative.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.440
Yeah, it is Pacino.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.520
That's Pacino's latest role as running with scissors.

29:07.520 --> 29:11.200
Man, he has just become a caricature of himself.

29:11.200 --> 29:11.920
Oh, god.

29:11.920 --> 29:13.040
Oh, Hua.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.440
Diggity dog.

29:14.440 --> 29:16.440
I don't know. Just want to talk.

29:16.440 --> 29:17.040
Diggity dog?

29:17.040 --> 29:17.840
Yeah, I don't know.

29:17.840 --> 29:18.920
Did he say that in dog day afternoon?

29:18.920 --> 29:19.920
Yeah, probably.

29:19.920 --> 29:20.480
Diggity dog.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.960
I want my ransom.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.440
I want my trans lover.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.200
I want to talk to a negotiator.

29:25.200 --> 29:25.840
Diggity dog.

29:25.840 --> 29:26.640
Dog day.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.920
We've got a dog day here.

29:28.920 --> 29:29.440
Hot cha cha cha.

29:29.440 --> 29:30.240
Dog deletion.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.840
I told you about the time I peed next to him at the restaurant.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.280
And he had headphones on.

29:34.280 --> 29:37.520
And he was, I think, learning lions.

29:37.520 --> 29:38.840
I peeing next to a chain.

29:38.840 --> 29:44.400
He's like, hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.880
As it's coming out, is that the reaction to the,

29:47.880 --> 29:49.040
was it a good peeing?

29:49.040 --> 29:50.480
I think he was learning lions.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.280
He had little earbuds in.

29:53.280 --> 29:57.240
And he, I don't know.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.000
This is part of the explanation for what Pacino became

30:00.000 --> 30:02.400
as an icon, like it's that he started

30:02.400 --> 30:03.760
running lions at the urinals.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.520
So he's suffering from piss shiver

30:05.520 --> 30:07.200
while he's committing these lines.

30:07.200 --> 30:10.800
Like he, you know, it's funny you mentioned that, Dan,

30:10.800 --> 30:12.600
tonight's show has been brought to you by piss shiver.

30:12.600 --> 30:13.520
Piss shiver.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.280
Is your body filled with the warmth

30:15.280 --> 30:21.080
of having body temperature urine in its bladder?

30:21.080 --> 30:23.720
As it rapidly exits, don't just shiver.

30:23.720 --> 30:25.440
Piss shiver when you're at the urinal

30:25.440 --> 30:27.200
and can't explain why you're suddenly shuddering.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.480
Hey, look down here.

30:29.480 --> 30:31.040
It's me.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.960
Your dick.

30:32.960 --> 30:37.040
I sure have been shivering a lot while I've been pissing.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.880
You know, I ain't just an enlarged form of clitoris

30:39.880 --> 30:42.040
that was mutated when your species decided

30:42.040 --> 30:46.200
to become sexually reproductive instead of asexual.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.280
That was just a thank you, ladies.

30:48.280 --> 30:48.880
Can we?

30:48.880 --> 30:51.680
Is there a way to reverse angle on Rob Schrab

30:51.680 --> 30:53.200
with his feet on the stage?

30:53.200 --> 30:55.280
He's so clearly.

30:55.280 --> 30:59.160
You look like you're about to rap battle at an office.

30:59.160 --> 31:01.640
Well, why don't we bring him up now that we're comfortable

31:01.640 --> 31:02.600
and you're not?

31:02.600 --> 31:03.760
Do we have enough mics?

31:03.760 --> 31:05.200
It doesn't look like there's any.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.160
Oh, I didn't see that one.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.520
Sorry, everybody.

31:07.520 --> 31:11.680
Rob Schrab to the stage.

31:11.680 --> 31:12.800
We can't control you.

31:12.800 --> 31:13.800
You can't control us.

31:17.800 --> 31:22.440
Look, largely lifting himself from the seat.

31:22.440 --> 31:25.400
He sits and pulls his legs up on the stage.

31:25.400 --> 31:25.900
Yeah!

31:31.160 --> 31:33.120
Sauntering to the chair.

31:33.120 --> 31:38.000
He gestures lazily at the microphone and cup.

31:38.000 --> 31:38.600
Hello?

31:38.600 --> 31:40.760
He stands.

31:40.760 --> 31:41.760
Hi, Rob.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.040
Hi.

31:43.040 --> 31:43.680
How are you?

31:43.680 --> 31:44.920
I'm OK.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.320
What are you up to, Rob?

31:46.320 --> 31:47.960
How was your Thanksgiving?

31:47.960 --> 31:48.520
It was good.

31:48.520 --> 31:56.560
I went to Topanga and spent it with Kate's parents and family.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.080
Did they enjoy you?

31:58.080 --> 31:58.560
I think so.

31:58.560 --> 31:59.800
Did they like their Rob Schrab?

31:59.800 --> 32:01.120
I think so.

32:01.120 --> 32:04.120
I was cutting it up during dinner.

32:04.120 --> 32:08.360
Do you remember any bone mozz that you fucking threw out?

32:08.360 --> 32:09.000
Bone mozz.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.360
Top three bone mozz.

32:10.360 --> 32:11.080
Bone mozz?

32:11.080 --> 32:11.760
Bone mozz?

32:11.760 --> 32:13.160
Number one.

32:13.160 --> 32:13.920
Number three.

32:13.920 --> 32:14.800
Bone mozz.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.120
I don't know what that word is.

32:16.120 --> 32:16.920
Bone mozz.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.280
Bone mozz.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.280
And any zinger.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.160
I still don't know.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.600
It doesn't matter how you pronounce it.

32:21.600 --> 32:25.120
Any fun little sugar coated fucking zinger.

32:25.120 --> 32:26.080
I don't really remember.

32:26.080 --> 32:29.680
I was just a lot of just me being an idiot.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.040
I don't really have any.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.080
What's your secret, Rob?

32:32.080 --> 32:33.440
Would you go into a room?

32:33.440 --> 32:35.120
I just say things.

32:35.120 --> 32:35.840
That's mine.

32:35.840 --> 32:38.280
When you're in a room full of strangers,

32:38.280 --> 32:41.080
if you could give people out there any advice,

32:41.080 --> 32:44.520
what would be your advice to somebody

32:44.520 --> 32:46.840
going into a room full of strangers

32:46.840 --> 32:48.720
and how to win them over?

32:48.720 --> 32:49.280
Oh, god.

32:49.280 --> 32:49.960
I don't know.

32:49.960 --> 32:53.720
In a social or a professional setting?

32:53.720 --> 32:58.720
Let's just say at a social setting, like Thanksgiving.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.480
I don't know how I would.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.880
I don't think I've ever won anybody over.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.800
Well, I'll take some time with that question.

33:04.800 --> 33:07.040
And then the format of the show will

33:07.040 --> 33:10.720
swivel back over to talking about the DSA.

33:10.720 --> 33:15.120
And then when we come back to Schrab,

33:15.120 --> 33:17.520
we're going to learn his secret for when he enters a room.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.120
We're going to find out your secret.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.320
We're going to find out your secret.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.920
I don't want to monetize it, dude.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.560
Just think about it for what?

33:23.560 --> 33:24.960
He doesn't have to monetize it.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.320
He just has to win.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.800
Just think about it for five minutes.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.320
I'm going to talk to Josh Andraski from the DSA.

33:30.320 --> 33:32.760
And then you think about your secret, Rob.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.320
Your secret.

33:34.320 --> 33:35.680
I'm not making this to hear.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.960
Everybody wants to listen to me be a fake interviewer

33:38.960 --> 33:40.960
or know about power.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.160
I'm saying, let's blend this.

33:42.160 --> 33:42.720
This is good.

33:42.720 --> 33:43.960
It's like a parfait.

33:43.960 --> 33:46.360
So just think about the answer to that question.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.040
What's your secret?

33:48.040 --> 33:52.760
Josh, we can't really talk about the Democratic Party

33:52.760 --> 33:56.320
or the remnants thereof without talking about this new word

33:56.320 --> 33:58.120
that I learned, neoliberalism.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.160
Ah, yes, neoliberalism.

34:00.160 --> 34:07.600
Neoliberalism is basically socially liberal but not

34:07.600 --> 34:08.840
but fiscally conservative.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.080
And as somebody who's generally corporate.

34:11.080 --> 34:11.600
Right.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.760
And I forget who tweeted this.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.560
It's one of my favorite tweets.

34:15.560 --> 34:18.160
I'm socially liberal but fiscally conservative.

34:18.160 --> 34:21.400
I hate the problems, but I love their causes.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.800
And that's really what it is.

34:23.800 --> 34:27.680
And somebody else tweeted, the platonic ideal of neoliberalism

34:27.680 --> 34:30.080
is to have racial and gender balance

34:30.080 --> 34:31.720
on the board of a drone company.

34:31.720 --> 34:32.480
Right.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.120
It's like this hollow identity politics, something

34:35.120 --> 34:39.480
like Los Angeles' district attorney is a woman of color.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.400
And you think that's a victory to have a black woman in such

34:42.400 --> 34:44.800
like a big position of power.

34:44.800 --> 34:45.600
And it is.

34:45.600 --> 34:49.840
However, she has not persecuted any murderous policeman

34:49.840 --> 34:51.560
in her entire tenure.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.640
And so something like that would be an example

34:54.640 --> 34:56.960
of that's probably neoliberalism in action.

34:56.960 --> 35:00.480
It's somebody who doesn't want to upset the status quo,

35:00.480 --> 35:05.000
who still wants the ultra-wealthy to be as rich as possible

35:05.000 --> 35:07.120
and the rest of us to be fighting for crumbs.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.960
But it's the thing that was working yesterday,

35:08.960 --> 35:12.280
which I have found in my exploration of white fragility.

35:12.280 --> 35:13.560
I went and bought a gun.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.960
That's a classic neoliberal move, I would say.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.600
I mean, it's just a classic white dude move.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.640
That's a classic scared white guy move is to buy.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.120
It's the scared white guy move.

35:21.120 --> 35:24.840
And my therapist would say, who's the gun for?

35:24.840 --> 35:27.840
But she's my therapist, so I didn't realize until 10 minutes

35:27.840 --> 35:31.520
in the conversation, she's asking, is it for you?

35:31.520 --> 35:34.600
Because Hunter S. Thompson bought one at one point,

35:34.600 --> 35:36.000
didn't buy it for himself.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
And I would like thank you for that equation.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.520
And he's famous.

35:40.520 --> 35:41.040
More important.

35:41.040 --> 35:44.000
Blowing his brains out and letting his daughter find them.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.640
Great suicide note, though.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.040
Football season's over.

35:48.040 --> 35:53.000
But it was because it was the appeal, the billboard,

35:53.000 --> 35:54.560
for neoliberalism now.

35:54.560 --> 35:57.480
I think I've been a spokesman for it in my behavior.

35:57.480 --> 36:00.520
And if I just put my thumb in my mouth

36:00.520 --> 36:02.600
and just say what I'm really feeling

36:02.600 --> 36:08.800
without Kool-Aid plunging into some cause that's

36:08.800 --> 36:11.320
going to not benefit me, ultimately,

36:11.320 --> 36:13.680
or in any immediate way that I can feel,

36:13.680 --> 36:16.480
if I just follow my comfort, I am a neoliberal.

36:16.480 --> 36:18.000
I want my Obama back.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.560
I want my Obama back.

36:20.560 --> 36:21.280
Right.

36:21.280 --> 36:26.040
And that is something that people need to.

36:26.040 --> 36:30.160
I want you to have committed more to your Obama back.

36:30.160 --> 36:31.600
Well, there's an extra syllable in there.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.920
I want my Obama back, Obama back, Obama back, Obama back.

36:34.920 --> 36:35.640
There's got to be.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.280
Somebody has done that.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.480
Come on.

36:38.480 --> 36:43.800
Technocratic, bureaucratic, Obama back.

36:43.800 --> 36:44.880
It's like the West Wing was real.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.000
It's not a thing, because then there's

36:46.000 --> 36:48.160
ribs and then that's an unfortunate cultural connotation

36:48.160 --> 36:50.160
that we don't want to step into.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.640
But you did a really good job of avoiding it

36:51.640 --> 36:53.480
until you mentioned that you avoided it.

36:53.480 --> 36:53.960
Right.

36:53.960 --> 36:54.200
I know.

36:54.200 --> 36:54.840
Well, that's me.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.320
That's classic Harmon.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.200
Hey, everybody, look.

36:57.200 --> 37:01.040
I'm not racist, because I wasn't thinking about this.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.040
Schrab, all right.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.760
What's your secret?

37:03.760 --> 37:06.280
No excuse.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.520
How are you cutting it up?

37:07.520 --> 37:08.720
How am I cutting it up?

37:08.720 --> 37:09.200
I don't know.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.080
I was just being an idiot.

37:11.080 --> 37:14.760
There was two children there and there at that age

37:14.760 --> 37:19.920
that they just are laughing at any attention.

37:19.920 --> 37:28.520
I think like four and six.

37:28.520 --> 37:30.360
Those are good social ages.

37:30.360 --> 37:32.080
I like the fours and the sixes.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.360
Yeah, I guess.

37:33.360 --> 37:35.920
Yeah, I'm just goofing off.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.600
Because they're verbal, but they're inquisitive,

37:38.600 --> 37:44.120
and if you talk to them like a grownup, they're pretty fun.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.600
Yeah.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.680
Not to pry.

37:47.680 --> 37:50.000
This could go into personal stuff with you and Kate,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.080
who I married.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.280
You married Kate?

37:53.280 --> 37:55.960
I officiated your marriage to her.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.520
You guys had no plans to have children,

37:57.520 --> 37:58.920
which is why you didn't bother getting married.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.720
I was the MC at that wedding.

38:00.720 --> 38:01.800
Is there any change there?

38:01.800 --> 38:03.240
Is there any capacity for change?

38:03.240 --> 38:04.600
Do the two of you ever talk about it?

38:04.600 --> 38:05.600
No.

38:05.600 --> 38:06.100
No.

38:06.100 --> 38:08.400
You've just resolved no kids, like you're both totally.

38:08.400 --> 38:12.560
I think it's come up.

38:12.560 --> 38:17.640
Kate just is not interested, and I'm fine with that.

38:17.640 --> 38:20.360
I don't really.

38:20.360 --> 38:21.520
There's other people's kids.

38:21.520 --> 38:24.080
Yeah, I mean, there's other people's kids.

38:24.080 --> 38:29.080
My biggest thing about children is parents.

38:32.280 --> 38:34.120
What happens to, do you have kids?

38:34.120 --> 38:35.120
Am I insulting you?

38:35.120 --> 38:35.120
No.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.120
OK, I'm sorry.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.480
Yeah, no, I do not have kids.

38:38.480 --> 38:47.240
OK, so I see what happens to people when they become parents.

38:47.240 --> 38:51.720
And it's something that's great for them.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.200
Even the coolest parents in the world,

38:53.200 --> 38:55.080
and I think I have seen them like I've really.

38:55.080 --> 38:57.280
The cool parents are the worst.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.640
Well, they're not the worst, but well, because I.

38:59.640 --> 39:01.040
No, they're the worst.

39:01.040 --> 39:05.400
Well, there's things that it heightens.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.800
The actual cool parents who are people who are like, wow,

39:07.800 --> 39:10.480
well, that's as good as you're going to get as far as parenting.

39:10.480 --> 39:14.320
I still recognize the parenting has subsumed their identity.

39:14.320 --> 39:14.920
But that's it.

39:14.920 --> 39:18.560
I mean, the thing like, first of all,

39:18.560 --> 39:21.400
I'll put my dog up against any baby any day.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.400
Any day.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.040
Well, that's a biological killing machine.

39:24.040 --> 39:24.640
I want to see this.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.240
That's not a fair fight.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.480
No, no, no, no.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.040
Your dog could kill more people.

39:29.040 --> 39:29.920
No, no, no, no.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.320
Not a fight.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.160
Not a fight.

39:33.160 --> 39:36.200
I'll put my dog up against a baby.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.440
Just like, what are you going to do?

39:38.440 --> 39:40.320
Also, people don't know that.

39:40.320 --> 39:41.320
More durable than your baby.

39:41.320 --> 39:45.280
Rob Schrab runs a baby dog fight ring out of his fucking

39:45.280 --> 39:47.280
apartment.

39:47.280 --> 39:51.400
It's not at all what I was saying, but sure.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.640
So where are these fights if we wanted to buy tickets?

39:53.640 --> 39:56.760
Like I just said, when you interrupted me,

39:56.760 --> 39:58.760
that's not what I meant.

39:58.760 --> 40:01.320
How do you get baby blood out of a carpet?

40:01.320 --> 40:03.520
I didn't mean that.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.880
Well, club soda.

40:05.880 --> 40:09.200
Comparing my dog to a baby.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.200
Yes, OK, so finish that thought.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.680
Like a dog is my dog.

40:13.680 --> 40:14.560
You could experience it.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.160
Not a dog.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.000
My dog.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
You can experience loving him.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.640
Your dog, the notorious baby killer.

40:21.640 --> 40:25.760
Like I just said, that's not what I meant.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.360
All right.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.560
Well, all right, swiveling back over.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.000
Josh, we can't run.

40:30.000 --> 40:37.480
And that's how I charm a new group of people.

40:37.480 --> 40:39.480
I want to talk about the classic thing.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.120
But for kids, maybe it's not classic.

40:41.120 --> 40:45.000
Like Marxism versus Communism versus Socialism.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.320
Marx versus, like, I just found out

40:48.320 --> 40:51.680
about this guy, Michael Harrington, who's like that was,

40:51.680 --> 40:53.400
he's dead, right?

40:53.400 --> 40:54.600
Yeah, I guess.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.360
But he was an author, activist, whatever.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.640
He's sort of the, maybe the, could we say,

40:58.640 --> 41:00.800
the Chomsky of the DSA or something?

41:00.800 --> 41:01.240
I don't know.

41:01.240 --> 41:04.240
Again, like he's a guy who I personally haven't really.

41:04.240 --> 41:06.720
And this is like the thing that I love about the DSA

41:06.720 --> 41:09.000
is I dropped out of high school.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.600
I have never read Marx.

41:11.600 --> 41:15.440
I think that socialism is as a concept.

41:15.440 --> 41:18.360
It's mostly the liberation of your own body

41:18.360 --> 41:21.160
from, like, a corporate overlord.

41:21.160 --> 41:25.440
It's basically the idea of putting the capital,

41:25.440 --> 41:28.200
putting the means of production, which is specifically

41:28.200 --> 41:29.160
what Marx talked about.

41:29.160 --> 41:32.920
I've read quotes, specifically, like.

41:32.920 --> 41:36.440
You got the Snapple, the limited edition Marx-Snapple.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.040
Yeah, which is weird that his state

41:38.040 --> 41:40.240
agreed to any sort of commodification.

41:40.240 --> 41:41.960
Yeah, believe it or not.

41:41.960 --> 41:45.360
I think you had a lot to do with old world blue blood

41:45.360 --> 41:46.320
relationships.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.680
The futures.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.080
The Snapple fortune was, you know,

41:50.080 --> 41:52.720
the Marx chewing gum company, which is something

41:52.720 --> 41:54.160
they've buried in the history books.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.880
Yeah, they don't talk about that.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.600
They're both Procter and Gamble.

41:57.600 --> 42:02.960
So, but anyways, but Marx is like, I'm with you.

42:02.960 --> 42:04.200
I have no research.

42:04.200 --> 42:07.800
I'm 11 minutes of Wikipedia.

42:07.800 --> 42:11.200
The reason I bring this stuff up is because, for instance,

42:11.200 --> 42:14.600
your average 16-year-old kid right now, who, for better

42:14.600 --> 42:17.560
or for worse, is waiting in the same swimming pool

42:17.560 --> 42:23.560
that we all are, I'm getting in fights on the reg fam

42:23.560 --> 42:29.000
with people who they can, they could be children.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.480
They could be 40 years older than me.

42:31.480 --> 42:34.240
They could be any of those things and be totally,

42:34.240 --> 42:37.560
but we're all splashing around in the same pool.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.280
And that's a distinct advantage to people

42:40.280 --> 42:44.200
who are driven by competition and individualism.

42:44.200 --> 42:49.000
And I'll say it, hatred, because you can say, for instance,

42:49.000 --> 42:52.800
if I were to say, I'm having the DSA on my show tomorrow

42:52.800 --> 42:55.400
night, someone might say, for instance, I don't know.

42:55.400 --> 42:56.520
Oh, yeah, great.

42:56.520 --> 42:59.160
You guys think Nazis are responsible for all these deaths

42:59.160 --> 43:02.280
that you faked, but communism has been responsible

43:02.280 --> 43:06.440
for over 80 billion deaths in the last 120 years, blah,

43:06.440 --> 43:10.280
blah, blah, because they want to label and they want to.

43:10.280 --> 43:12.400
And this is the thing that I would say,

43:12.400 --> 43:15.240
like, if there's anything that I've learned,

43:15.240 --> 43:18.280
it's get off the fucking internet.

43:18.280 --> 43:21.040
Stop your book clubs are fine.

43:21.040 --> 43:23.600
Like, you can read Marx and talk about whatever.

43:23.600 --> 43:28.320
But I learned everything I know about politics,

43:28.320 --> 43:33.240
about socialism, about the thing that radicalized me

43:33.240 --> 43:36.840
was going and meeting people, hearing people,

43:36.840 --> 43:38.680
hearing people that work for teachers unions,

43:38.680 --> 43:42.760
hearing some intellectuals that work as professors

43:42.760 --> 43:48.200
or whatever, just rank and file union folks and nurses

43:48.200 --> 43:50.520
and this and that, and talking to all these people

43:50.520 --> 43:55.040
and watching the action and participating in an action.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.960
That's what teaches me.

43:56.960 --> 44:00.920
And to me specifically, I think that we as socialists,

44:00.920 --> 44:03.920
we as leftists need to remove ourselves

44:03.920 --> 44:05.800
from the world of academia, because I think

44:05.800 --> 44:07.600
that that was purposefully done.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.400
That was sort of a move like, oh, let's get them all

44:09.400 --> 44:11.800
in their little bubbles, their little coastal bubbles

44:11.800 --> 44:13.880
where they just sit and they wear glasses

44:13.880 --> 44:15.240
and they look like their bones are going to break

44:15.240 --> 44:18.280
if they wear a sweater and they fucking talk and talk and talk

44:18.280 --> 44:21.280
and they just want to jerk off over which dead Russian dude

44:21.280 --> 44:22.920
like they liked the most.

44:22.920 --> 44:23.760
Right.

44:23.760 --> 44:24.600
And real.

44:24.600 --> 44:27.480
Playing philosophical chess on a daytime talk show.

44:27.480 --> 44:28.320
Sports.

44:28.320 --> 44:29.520
It's the same fucking thing.

44:29.520 --> 44:31.480
It's who's your team, who's this?

44:31.480 --> 44:34.040
And a lot of politics, not just like leftist politics,

44:34.040 --> 44:38.000
a lot of like national politics is just sports as well.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.040
But when you actually get offline and get out of the

44:42.040 --> 44:45.640
university and go onto the streets and start talking

44:45.640 --> 44:48.160
about people and trying to help them like, you know,

44:48.160 --> 44:51.280
DSA right now, for example, like doing an action

44:51.280 --> 44:53.480
like this will teach you more, I think, personally

44:53.480 --> 44:55.360
about socialism than reading anything.

44:55.360 --> 44:58.120
They're putting on a taillight benefit.

44:58.120 --> 45:01.720
DSA Los Angeles is doing this inspired by DSA New Orleans.

45:01.720 --> 45:06.520
So the thought was people of color, migrant workers,

45:06.520 --> 45:08.880
you know, just undocumented folks,

45:08.880 --> 45:12.680
they are getting pulled over and they are being thrown

45:12.680 --> 45:13.760
into the carceral state.

45:13.760 --> 45:17.000
They're being thrown into, you know, if you're undocumented,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.240
you're being thrown into a private prison

45:19.240 --> 45:20.360
where they hold immigrants.

45:20.360 --> 45:21.640
It's not like they go to a radison.

45:21.640 --> 45:23.800
They go to a private prison.

45:23.800 --> 45:26.120
Or if you're just a fucking black dude,

45:26.120 --> 45:27.880
you're going to get fucked with by the cops

45:27.880 --> 45:31.440
because the police is inherently a racist system.

45:31.440 --> 45:35.840
And so what we're doing is we are for free

45:35.840 --> 45:38.080
providing break lights.

45:38.080 --> 45:40.000
If your break lights out, that's most likely

45:40.000 --> 45:41.200
what's going to get you pulled over.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.360
Right, and then they can search your car and stuff

45:43.360 --> 45:44.960
because you look not white.

45:44.960 --> 45:45.960
Right, exactly.

45:45.960 --> 45:49.400
And it could and likely often does end up

45:49.400 --> 45:51.680
with some unarmed person being shot.

45:51.680 --> 45:54.960
And so if we, if that is a concept that's like borrowed

45:54.960 --> 45:57.480
from the black panthers known as like mutual aid,

45:57.480 --> 45:59.760
we help them, but they also help us

45:59.760 --> 46:02.080
because we have now ingrained ourselves

46:02.080 --> 46:03.320
in the community more.

46:03.320 --> 46:05.760
And so we can like get more people

46:05.760 --> 46:07.760
to go do more cool shit like that.

46:07.760 --> 46:09.680
It's like, oh, who's this fucking dude

46:09.680 --> 46:11.200
that just gave me a free break light?

46:11.200 --> 46:14.240
Right, no, we promise we're not asking you for anything.

46:14.240 --> 46:16.360
Like, we don't want your Facebook login.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.280
We don't want any of that shit.

46:17.280 --> 46:21.880
If you do that 100 times, then, so turning your money

46:21.880 --> 46:26.520
into shit that actually translates with the most

46:26.520 --> 46:29.200
fidelity into changing an individual life.

46:29.200 --> 46:30.200
Absolutely, and it's not shared.

46:30.200 --> 46:30.800
How do you do that?

46:30.800 --> 46:33.560
How do you just distribute the, I mean, that's awesome.

46:33.560 --> 46:37.760
Right, so for what we have, if you go to dsa-la.org

46:37.760 --> 46:41.080
and you look and you click on the tail light benefit page,

46:41.080 --> 46:43.920
there is a Kickstarter type thing.

46:43.920 --> 46:48.360
It's within our chapters, like a fundraising thing.

46:48.360 --> 46:51.680
And so far, we've raised over $1,000.

46:51.680 --> 46:54.920
And then what happens is we just ask around to friends

46:54.920 --> 46:55.800
who know mechanics.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.280
We've reached out to high schools that have shop classes.

46:58.280 --> 47:02.520
We're looking for a venue now, a large parking lot.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.240
The school would be rad because ice

47:04.240 --> 47:07.200
can't come on school property.

47:07.200 --> 47:11.480
And so what we do is we then talk to our friends

47:11.480 --> 47:15.160
and say, hey, who knows how to change a break light?

47:15.160 --> 47:18.680
Then they run a training for the interested volunteers.

47:18.680 --> 47:21.240
So now our volunteers know how to fix their own cars,

47:21.240 --> 47:23.280
and then they go help fix other people's cars

47:23.280 --> 47:24.360
and then just talk to them.

47:24.360 --> 47:25.880
Nice, yeah.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.200
That's appealing to a guy like me because I'm like, oh, shit.

47:28.200 --> 47:30.960
No, I feel a little more macho because I'm

47:30.960 --> 47:32.280
dealing in break lights now.

47:32.280 --> 47:33.840
Right.

47:33.840 --> 47:35.320
You use your hands to help your community.

47:35.320 --> 47:38.640
Speaking of which, not to put you on the spot,

47:38.640 --> 47:40.840
but a guy like me.

47:40.840 --> 47:47.540
So classically fragile, neoliberal,

47:47.540 --> 47:50.600
maybe philosophically progressive, no research,

47:50.600 --> 47:53.800
total comfort zone, five bedroom house,

47:53.800 --> 47:55.880
just want everything to go back to the way it was,

47:55.880 --> 47:58.360
shuddering at night, fearing not being

47:58.360 --> 48:01.200
able to protect my girlfriend from any form of economic

48:01.200 --> 48:03.600
destabilization in any manifestation thereof,

48:03.600 --> 48:05.400
just want my comfort back.

48:05.400 --> 48:08.040
I felt like I was playing the game right, blah, blah, blah.

48:08.040 --> 48:11.320
You can read it all in my pamphlet.

48:11.320 --> 48:15.280
You get the picture with me.

48:15.280 --> 48:17.520
Whether it's the famous version of me,

48:17.520 --> 48:22.080
but also I'm selfishly asking, what are more like you're

48:22.080 --> 48:24.120
directing me to that website in this case,

48:24.120 --> 48:29.240
but what are little pieces of candy you can hand out?

48:29.240 --> 48:33.920
Once I get it on my tongue, at no risk to my own comfort,

48:33.920 --> 48:38.000
that when I taste it, it'll start happening for me.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.120
This is a thing that we talk about a lot,

48:40.120 --> 48:43.080
that our health care committee, and a lot of people

48:43.080 --> 48:45.880
working nationally in the health care committee talk about,

48:45.880 --> 48:49.560
is the difference between selfishness, selflessness,

48:49.560 --> 48:50.840
and self-interest.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.080
These are three different things.

48:52.080 --> 48:55.080
Selfishness is, hey, I got all this money.

48:55.080 --> 48:56.600
I don't want it to go to anybody.

48:56.600 --> 48:58.240
No taxes, whatever.

48:58.240 --> 49:00.720
And pure greed.

49:00.720 --> 49:04.440
Or conversely, I broke my leg.

49:04.440 --> 49:08.200
I need Medicare for all because my leg is broken.

49:08.200 --> 49:12.120
Selflessness is, I'm a perfectly healthy person.

49:12.120 --> 49:13.920
I don't need anything.

49:13.920 --> 49:15.680
I'll never be sick because I'm in shape.

49:15.680 --> 49:16.200
Take my bone marrow.

49:16.200 --> 49:17.400
I've got extra marrow.

49:17.400 --> 49:19.120
Right, and you're doing this for somebody else

49:19.120 --> 49:20.760
and not for you at all.

49:20.760 --> 49:28.080
Self-interest is, how can I help everybody else out,

49:28.080 --> 49:29.760
while also helping myself out?

49:29.760 --> 49:31.920
Because we're all in this together.

49:31.920 --> 49:36.040
And so that's the tone that we're aiming for when we talk to people.

49:36.040 --> 49:37.440
You guys like that third one, right?

49:37.440 --> 49:37.680
Yes.

49:37.680 --> 49:38.240
OK, could.

49:38.240 --> 49:39.600
Because that really sounds good.

49:39.600 --> 49:41.400
Because it's you and everyone else.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.800
Your little dance that you did.

49:42.800 --> 49:46.080
Well, because it's like, there is room in the world

49:46.080 --> 49:52.640
for people under an actual form of democratic socialism.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.160
Tell me yes or no.

49:54.160 --> 49:58.920
I think the big root fear for, I would say especially,

49:58.920 --> 50:00.680
but definitely including poor people,

50:00.680 --> 50:04.280
is, hey, wait, I don't want the rules to monopoly

50:04.280 --> 50:07.840
to be that you can't have more money than someone else.

50:07.840 --> 50:09.720
Right, and see, this is a thing that

50:09.720 --> 50:14.160
is a very successful propaganda campaign.

50:14.160 --> 50:17.040
It's conflating communism and socialism, essentially, right?

50:17.040 --> 50:19.760
Yes, and democratic socialism specifically

50:19.760 --> 50:22.000
is not like a state, like it's not

50:22.000 --> 50:24.040
like this big state power or whatever.

50:24.040 --> 50:26.560
Roads in Medicare are socialist.

50:26.560 --> 50:27.520
Then they exist in it.

50:27.520 --> 50:29.640
Social security is socialist.

50:29.640 --> 50:30.800
So it exists today.

50:30.800 --> 50:31.320
Absolutely.

50:31.320 --> 50:32.440
It's not communism.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.080
Probably the most famous form of socialism

50:34.080 --> 50:35.280
is social security.

50:35.280 --> 50:39.160
And what it is, is it's not only a thing that benefits people

50:39.160 --> 50:42.040
from people that already have too much, where it's like,

50:42.040 --> 50:42.720
this is fair.

50:42.720 --> 50:45.000
We all agree that everybody knows

50:45.000 --> 50:46.880
that the people at the top aren't paying enough.

50:46.880 --> 50:49.880
And so we all can agree that, OK, they just

50:49.880 --> 50:52.760
get paid a little bit, or they pay a little bit more

50:52.760 --> 50:53.800
into taxes.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.360
And then literally, we all have health care.

50:56.360 --> 50:57.920
We all have access to a doctor.

50:57.920 --> 50:58.800
It's that easy.

50:58.800 --> 51:02.720
And what we want more is a co-op,

51:02.720 --> 51:06.400
where you're a worker, you own your company.

51:06.400 --> 51:07.320
You're a shareholder.

51:07.320 --> 51:10.600
There's not a room full of faceless number

51:10.600 --> 51:16.800
men in gray, smoky suits with fucking guns to a dog's head.

51:16.800 --> 51:18.160
And all the profits go to them.

51:18.160 --> 51:19.320
And stockholders.

51:19.320 --> 51:20.360
Yeah, the shareholders.

51:20.360 --> 51:21.440
Right, with their interests.

51:21.440 --> 51:23.520
And so a good example of this is another thing

51:23.520 --> 51:25.240
that we're doing with the DSA right now,

51:25.240 --> 51:28.720
which is we are trying to help Los Angeles create

51:28.720 --> 51:30.080
a public bank.

51:30.080 --> 51:33.000
Not for you and me to go to the ATM,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.120
but when you think about it, Los Angeles

51:35.120 --> 51:40.560
has something like $8 billion in 700 bank accounts

51:40.560 --> 51:44.040
all at Wells Fargo at that one bank.

51:44.040 --> 51:45.480
And that $8 billion is everything

51:45.480 --> 51:50.120
from your electric bill payments to your taxes, to fees,

51:50.120 --> 51:52.880
to 401k plans for city clerks.

51:52.880 --> 51:55.520
When that money is in Wells Fargo,

51:55.520 --> 51:58.240
Wells Fargo, then through loans, and dividends,

51:58.240 --> 51:59.680
and investments, and whatnot, they

51:59.680 --> 52:01.680
spread that money to Philip Morris.

52:01.680 --> 52:04.680
They spread that money to weapons companies, and so.

52:04.680 --> 52:05.840
Keystone Pipeline.

52:05.840 --> 52:07.280
Exactly, yes, that's one of the big ones.

52:07.280 --> 52:08.600
What's the phrase for this again?

52:08.600 --> 52:11.760
I saw Sarah Silverman talking about it.

52:11.760 --> 52:12.800
Divest.

52:12.800 --> 52:13.960
Divestment.

52:13.960 --> 52:17.960
And so a lot of people, Sarah Silverman, being one of them,

52:17.960 --> 52:20.840
myself included, have divested our personal money

52:20.840 --> 52:24.200
from big Wall Street banks and put them into credit unions.

52:24.200 --> 52:28.040
But now what we're asking is for cities, for municipalities,

52:28.040 --> 52:30.280
because you and me, and we do like this,

52:30.280 --> 52:33.400
it's a drop in the bucket, but $8 billion

52:33.400 --> 52:36.120
that is not going to get invested in horrible fossil

52:36.120 --> 52:39.800
fuels or private prisons is a big chunk of change

52:39.800 --> 52:40.280
to get out of Wall Street's hands.

52:40.280 --> 52:41.560
You were talking about that.

52:41.560 --> 52:43.880
This idea that local politics started

52:43.880 --> 52:46.520
to get subsumed by the banking industry.

52:46.520 --> 52:47.800
I'll be talking out of my ass.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.520
There's this YouTube documentary you

52:49.520 --> 52:51.360
can watch called Hyper Normalization, which

52:51.360 --> 52:52.000
is very scary.

52:52.000 --> 52:52.520
It's great.

52:52.520 --> 52:53.920
One of the things it talked about

52:53.920 --> 52:56.160
is there is this huge change where

52:56.160 --> 52:59.200
the bankers who were de facto funding everything

52:59.200 --> 53:01.120
on the government's behalf because banks

53:01.120 --> 53:04.320
have stand to gain from being in the business of government,

53:04.320 --> 53:05.640
they're like, yeah, let's go along.

53:05.640 --> 53:06.400
We'll give you the loan.

53:06.400 --> 53:07.400
You can make this building.

53:07.400 --> 53:08.360
We'll make City Hall.

53:08.360 --> 53:09.840
We're working together as a team.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.880
They went from that to saying, wait a second.

53:11.880 --> 53:13.120
We have all the money.

53:13.120 --> 53:14.080
Fuck you guys.

53:14.080 --> 53:16.200
Do everything we say, because we're

53:16.200 --> 53:18.880
a private corporation that now holds the purse strings

53:18.880 --> 53:20.240
for the government.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.400
And when that fundamental power shift changed,

53:22.400 --> 53:24.400
kind of everything got ruined and fucked.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.760
So it sounds like this is kind of a reversal.

53:26.760 --> 53:31.640
It's de-fanging the power that private finance

53:31.640 --> 53:33.320
has over the government, which shouldn't

53:33.320 --> 53:35.240
be in the business of private finance.

53:35.240 --> 53:38.040
It should be in the business of aiding people.

53:38.040 --> 53:38.800
Right, exactly.

53:38.800 --> 53:44.040
And so when your electric bill is sitting at Wells Fargo,

53:44.040 --> 53:46.760
Wells Fargo is making, if you pay your electric bill

53:46.760 --> 53:49.120
with a credit card, Wells Fargo gets a fee.

53:49.120 --> 53:51.120
And that's just coming right off the top from the city money.

53:51.120 --> 53:52.120
Not going to the government.

53:52.120 --> 53:53.960
Yeah, it doesn't go to the government.

53:53.960 --> 53:56.920
It doesn't go to make your roads better or your schools better.

53:56.920 --> 53:59.520
It goes into some fucking cokehead's pocket.

53:59.520 --> 54:03.120
And so what we want is to create a municipal bank where

54:03.120 --> 54:06.320
then all of this money is housed in an institution

54:06.320 --> 54:09.440
that's central motive isn't profit.

54:09.440 --> 54:13.920
It's central motive is, hey, this is city public money.

54:13.920 --> 54:14.480
It's your money.

54:14.480 --> 54:15.000
It's my money.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.160
It's all of our money.

54:16.160 --> 54:18.480
It should stay in Los Angeles.

54:18.480 --> 54:20.440
And beyond that, we should open it up

54:20.440 --> 54:23.600
so that people historically that have had a hard time getting

54:23.600 --> 54:25.560
loans can get loans.

54:25.560 --> 54:28.040
We can use this money like if it's

54:28.040 --> 54:31.560
Runwell, which banks happen to be Runwell when it comes

54:31.560 --> 54:34.440
to collecting a profit at the end of the year,

54:34.440 --> 54:36.240
instead of that profit going to bankers,

54:36.240 --> 54:40.000
that profit can go into housing or schools and the like.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.720
The theory behind the American dream

54:41.720 --> 54:45.280
is that money is the great equalizer,

54:45.280 --> 54:49.800
that it is somehow a supreme kind of metaphor of democracy

54:49.800 --> 54:52.400
that doesn't have to happen every four years pulling a lever,

54:52.400 --> 54:57.120
that you can work hard and work so hard that love your children

54:57.120 --> 54:59.120
so much, love your family so much,

54:59.120 --> 55:04.600
that you can chisel away at so much fucking coal in a mine,

55:04.600 --> 55:08.920
while your coal mining colleague is like, eh, you know,

55:08.920 --> 55:10.000
I love mining coal.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.800
But I'm going to go home and fucking chill.

55:12.800 --> 55:13.920
I can't wait to get off of work.

55:13.920 --> 55:15.400
And I figured out a way to mine coal.

55:15.400 --> 55:17.680
But that if you, for whatever reason,

55:17.680 --> 55:18.640
put yourself up by your own stress,

55:18.640 --> 55:19.800
that you're like, god damn it, I'm

55:19.800 --> 55:22.280
fucking going to mine so much fucking coal,

55:22.280 --> 55:25.960
and that somehow that represents some kind of egress,

55:25.960 --> 55:28.040
that you can become a capitalist,

55:28.040 --> 55:30.680
that you can become, that you can, you can,

55:30.680 --> 55:35.480
and that, there are people listening to that

55:35.480 --> 55:37.800
that disagree with me politically,

55:37.800 --> 55:41.520
but absolutely everyone agrees that that's what's for sale.

55:41.520 --> 55:43.880
It is the, whenever anyone detracts,

55:43.880 --> 55:46.480
so whenever someone like cries out for rights

55:46.480 --> 55:48.960
or fair treatment, and people start coming down to them

55:48.960 --> 55:50.640
and saying like, why don't you get a fucking job,

55:50.640 --> 55:52.400
why don't you just work hard, what do you mean,

55:52.400 --> 55:54.000
isn't this a slippery slope, all this stuff,

55:54.000 --> 55:57.760
every, all of those sentiments lead back to the Rome of,

55:57.760 --> 55:59.480
yeah, but shouldn't we just live in a society

55:59.480 --> 56:02.400
where if you work extra hard, harder than the person

56:02.400 --> 56:04.640
next to you, that that represents

56:04.640 --> 56:09.640
a changed opportunity to play the monopoly game?

56:10.840 --> 56:13.080
Right, and fundamentally it's a flawed premise

56:13.080 --> 56:16.080
because that doesn't take into account historical context

56:16.080 --> 56:18.000
of people of color being subjugated

56:18.000 --> 56:20.960
and generationally not being put in a position

56:20.960 --> 56:22.440
where they can get this job.

56:22.440 --> 56:25.120
So that leads white people who don't know

56:25.120 --> 56:28.800
that they have started the race at the finish line,

56:28.800 --> 56:30.720
going like, hey, look at these people lagging in the back,

56:30.720 --> 56:33.800
maybe if they ran faster, and the thing is,

56:33.800 --> 56:36.800
it's not your fault if you're a white dude

56:36.800 --> 56:40.200
that racism exists, and that's like a big problem

56:40.200 --> 56:42.120
with a lot of people on the left

56:42.120 --> 56:46.720
that are correctly angry but aren't trying to bring people in

56:46.720 --> 56:50.520
and go, I don't hate every Trump voter.

56:50.520 --> 56:52.360
I think that talking about Trump voters

56:52.360 --> 56:56.280
as this huge amorphous blob of hate is wrong,

56:56.280 --> 56:58.720
it's wrong-headed, it's bad.

56:58.720 --> 57:01.640
20% I'll give, 20% of Trump voters,

57:01.640 --> 57:04.040
irreparable racists, horrible people.

57:04.040 --> 57:07.640
But I really truly believe that 80% of Trump voters

57:07.640 --> 57:09.960
have a kid that's addicted to opiates

57:09.960 --> 57:11.640
or lost their house or lost their job,

57:11.640 --> 57:14.320
and like you said, they kept fucking working hard

57:14.320 --> 57:17.720
and nothing happened, and so they wanted to make a change.

57:17.720 --> 57:20.040
They just wanted to give a big fuck you

57:20.040 --> 57:22.200
to the system that ruined their lives,

57:22.200 --> 57:24.560
and the Democrats seeing this,

57:24.560 --> 57:26.040
and this is why I don't think you can work

57:26.040 --> 57:27.160
within the Democratic Party,

57:27.160 --> 57:29.840
because ultimately, they're beholden to their donors,

57:29.840 --> 57:31.720
but they see this, and who do they trot out

57:31.720 --> 57:36.120
to fight this, the avatar of the status quo?

57:36.120 --> 57:39.440
And you see it happen over and over and over again,

57:39.440 --> 57:40.920
and the only time that it works

57:40.920 --> 57:43.400
is if you have literally the most charismatic man

57:43.400 --> 57:46.640
who's ever been nominated for president

57:46.640 --> 57:48.840
to sell that bill of goods to people.

57:48.840 --> 57:52.240
Yeah, and if that ever happened, boy, you'd know it,

57:52.240 --> 57:55.240
because there would be this actual measurable shift

57:55.240 --> 58:00.240
in everything from economy to society to the point,

58:00.240 --> 58:04.480
and I'm not kissing his feet, but it's like that's,

58:04.480 --> 58:07.200
we cannot wait for another guy that happens

58:07.200 --> 58:10.200
to be that lightning in a jar, like.

58:10.200 --> 58:12.040
As long as it's, I don't know,

58:12.040 --> 58:15.480
because I think Obama as a man is a great man.

58:15.480 --> 58:17.880
I think he as a president,

58:17.880 --> 58:21.120
I disagreed with a lot of his decisions,

58:21.120 --> 58:24.960
obviously compared to the other guys that sandwiched him.

58:24.960 --> 58:29.800
He was this golden statue of pure greatness,

58:29.800 --> 58:33.560
but when you, I think the Democrats fundamentally

58:33.560 --> 58:35.160
don't understand how power works,

58:35.160 --> 58:37.720
because if they did, they wouldn't have lost thousands

58:37.720 --> 58:40.800
of state legislature seats under Obama.

58:40.800 --> 58:43.000
How, when you have such a popular president,

58:43.000 --> 58:47.040
can you just get fucking creamed in every local election?

58:47.040 --> 58:50.440
And it's because the Democrats are just so top heavy.

58:50.440 --> 58:54.000
They're this big bobblehead that is just doomed

58:54.000 --> 58:56.360
to fall forward and not move.

58:56.360 --> 58:57.200
Yeah, okay, yeah.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.400
And so that's why we at the DSA,

58:58.400 --> 59:00.800
we're not targeting even senators,

59:00.800 --> 59:03.640
or we want state legislatures and local people.

59:03.640 --> 59:05.520
It's the thing that we all have in common with these,

59:05.520 --> 59:07.600
let's say these 20% of Trump voters

59:07.600 --> 59:09.440
who actually voted on a frustration.

59:09.440 --> 59:12.680
You can, we're cousins, all of us,

59:12.680 --> 59:15.920
if you in your backyard have,

59:15.920 --> 59:17.720
there's a pothole that hasn't been filled.

59:17.720 --> 59:18.560
Right.

59:18.560 --> 59:22.640
If by virtue of some bureaucratic absurdity,

59:22.640 --> 59:27.640
your kid's leukemia isn't covered.

59:28.480 --> 59:29.840
Everybody-

59:29.840 --> 59:32.640
And bureaucratic absurdity in that case, by the way, is greed.

59:32.640 --> 59:33.480
Right?

59:33.480 --> 59:34.480
It's definitely greed.

59:34.480 --> 59:38.360
And it's just that because it's just by virtue

59:38.360 --> 59:40.240
of belt buckles and baseball caps.

59:40.240 --> 59:43.760
And the way that we express when we aren't armed

59:43.760 --> 59:46.000
with Noam Chomsky's vocabulary,

59:46.000 --> 59:47.800
our frustration with a system,

59:47.800 --> 59:51.920
some guy right next to me in terms of tax bracket

59:51.920 --> 59:55.440
and ideology is gonna maybe say key phrases

59:55.440 --> 59:59.640
that I have been armed to recognize as the enemy.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.920
Well, when these guys start talking about freedom of speech,

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.440
they mean they want to be Nazis.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.320
When these guys start talking about,

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.720
where's my gold pocket watch?

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.800
What they mean is that they want this institutionalized thing.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.160
And then they're hearing the same thing.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.320
And when these people talk about black lives matter,

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.280
they mean blah, blah, blah.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.880
And it's like, I mean, we've all said it a thousand times

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.880
and it's right under our nose.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:24.920
Like the divisions there are so artificially imposed.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.080
They have to be forced.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.880
Otherwise, if you, like these movies

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.120
where society collapses and then like within 30 years,

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.160
there's just Ivy and wolves everywhere.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.320
Like there is constant infrastructural pressure

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.120
necessary to maintain a division

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.880
between a black person and a white person in America.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.280
You have to wake up every morning

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.720
and make sure those two people know

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.640
that they're black and white.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.480
And they do.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.240
And the powers that be do that.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.080
And you know, it starts, you go back to Howard Zinn,

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.400
who is somebody I have read a lot

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.040
and really like to find my worldview.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.840
He talks about how after one of the first big slave rebellions

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.080
where white slaves and black slaves teamed up,

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.520
the powers that were were like, oh fuck,

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.200
if all of the poor people team up, we're fucked.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.400
So they created the middle class.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.560
They were like, okay, white slaves in the new world

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.920
when you guys, you guys got 20 years

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.400
and then you'll get a house and you'll get a car

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.360
and you'll get, you're not a car, but a horse,

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.840
which was, they called them cars back then.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.400
But you get a house and a horse and fucking,

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.840
you know, 40 acres in a mule.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.120
And that was so-

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.760
There's a horse in every pot.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.360
A horse in every pot and a chicken under foot.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.880
And one day the pot will have wheels, we promise.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:42.880
Yeah, the wheel pot and real pot happen.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.520
Hell yeah.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.600
So what that does is that makes it so that,

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.440
and you're right, it is this intense artificial pressure,

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.720
but it is very specific and it is there purposefully.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.600
And it's to keep the people that are two rungs

01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.920
from the bottom of the ladder kicking down.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.120
Just constantly kicking down.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.920
And if we all realize that we're all being fucked

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.920
and don't try to buy into the artificial fucking separation

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.400
of who we are and allow each other to make mistakes

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.160
and whatnot, that's how the labor movement

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.680
got us a weekend.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.840
You know, it was these, people weren't less racist

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.840
back when labor had more power in America.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.360
People were more racist.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.160
We get less racist every year,

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.720
but through great organizing and people that literally died

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.000
and standing up for their rights,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.440
you saw black people, white people, men and women team up

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.680
to go, we're all getting fucked.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.360
Some of us might be getting fucked less,

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.360
some of us might be getting fucked more,

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.320
but we're banding together because, again, self-interest.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.520
It helps me, it helps everybody else.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.440
We need to band together on this.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.120
Let's check in with Rob Schrab after this beat.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.280
Give me a beat.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.080
And Rob, I hear you're about to grace us with some tips

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:04.720
on how to make your Thanksgiving more vegan-friendly.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.920
This is how you get them.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:11.400
You give them a small dose of politics, and then entertainment.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.320
Entertainment.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.000
Show biz.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.200
Bring the jizz.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:23.480
Stroke your dick, make a pool of semen.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:29.480
Y'all know what I mean when I say millennials are gay.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:33.880
Today, everybody, explore your love.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.720
Not a hawk but a dove.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.480
White feathers with your brothers.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.600
Everybody's going to go into the nether in Minecraft.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.600
Let's rap about Minecraft.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.760
Dig a hole.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.120
I know about that.

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.400
Craft a pickaxe and craft some more.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.880
Then you can get more valuable, or you get a diamond,

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.480
and you make armor from that.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.440
And then you fight the dragon, and the game ends.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.840
But that's not, it doesn't have to.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.560
All right, sorry.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.640
I got excited about Minecraft.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.140
Break.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.040
Rap.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:09.520
Break.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:18.720
Church, can you do the Rihanna kind of thing?

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.840
Can you sing?

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.120
Can you just make me sing?

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.120
OK.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.280
Just, if he wants you to improvise a chorus.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:32.600
Like, if I rap and then you, and then I'll, OK.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.560
I'm rapping.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.200
I'm rapping real hard.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.320
But that's only one little shard from the mirror

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.800
of society's reflection.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.560
I fucked your mom with my erection.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.040
Erection.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.560
Erection.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.120
That's a hard dick.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.960
It's a dinner.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.080
Yo, church is on the mic.

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.440
Provided my hooks.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.840
She's like a chef assisting a cook,

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:00.600
but not in a hierarchical way.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.240
We're equal partners for equal pay, because we're socialists,

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.200
and her work should pay off.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.200
When your kid goes in, then they make him cough,

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.160
and it turns out one of his testicles has a tumor.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.320
It shouldn't spread like a bad rumor.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:17.880
It should be surgically removed for a minimal cost

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.320
by an effectively guided society.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:26.960
Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.640
Obviously, yeah.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.520
Choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo rapper.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.040
Choo-choo rapper like a choo-choo train,

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.560
ripped off Mr. Show just then.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.400
Not going to do it.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.040
Going to shuffle to the side.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.880
Fuck your mama till her pussy got extra wide.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.440
Subtle jack or bust in Britain.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.200
I don't fuck your mama if I'm spitting

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.000
and I'm chewing on tobacco.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.460
I go somewhere else, because I have some class.

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:54.960
Milk.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.860
Choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo.

01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:57.120
Tastes good.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.160
Fuck your mama like a choo-choo train.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.320
Choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.440
Fuck your mama like a choo-choo train.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.800
Fuck your mama like a choo-choo train.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.240
Fuck your mama like a choo-choo train.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.280
Fuck your mama like a choo-choo train.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.540
I'm the caboose choo-choo, choo-choo.

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.700
Fuck your mama like a choo-choo train.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:15.640
All aboard.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.860
All aboard, your mama.

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:18.260
go across the country.

01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:19.860
Fuck your mama so hard she looked like

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:20.700
a hubris home for you.

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:21.520
All aboard, you mama.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.340
Ah!

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:25.780
Choo, choo.

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.620
Fuck your mama like a choo-choo.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:28.180
Smoke stack on the tops, you and smoke.

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:29.020
Fuck your mama like a choo-choo.

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:31.300
Fuck your mama so hard, but it's not a joke.

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.700
I did it because I love her.

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.020
Fuck your mama.

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.140
Choo, choo, choo, choo.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.100
Ha ha ha ha ha.

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:43.260
Choo, choo, choo.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.300
Ha ha ha ha ha.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.700
Choo, choo, choo, choo.

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.540
You're the worst.

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.820
You're the worst.

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:48.660
Oh, it's great.

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:49.460
We're doing it.

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:50.460
Oh, it's really good.

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:51.300
It's really good.

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:52.780
What?

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:53.820
It's bad?

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:56.540
I fucked your mama like a choo-choo train.

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.580
All right, well, OK, thank you.

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:05.620
That was the exact dance Hilary did on Ellen.

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:07.100
It was great.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.060
Let's hear it for church.

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.060
Yeah, thanks, church.

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.060
Here's for church.

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.060
Woo!

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.060
Where did you get that?

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.060
Wait, church, come back up here.

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:20.420
You guys were talking earlier about going to Thanksgiving.

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:22.620
I met her parents.

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:28.500
And her father is John Goodman from the Big Lebowski,

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.900
but kind of mellow and funny.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.780
And he's military.

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.060
But it was cool meeting your family.

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:40.220
And he declared no political talk, no Trump talk,

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.780
no because he's a Trump voter, right?

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:43.940
Yeah.

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:47.260
And your mother voted Trump just no.

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.500
He doesn't know that, though.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.260
She secretly didn't do it.

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.260
Yeah.

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:55.220
And he declared before Thanksgiving dinner

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:57.980
that there would be no politics talk.

01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:59.940
Mostly because he knew he'd be outnumbered.

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:02.140
Yeah, how convenient.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.820
He's like, no politics.

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.300
10 on 1, no fight.

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:08.620
Your medals, sir, for silencing discourse

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:11.660
during this holiday, I give you.

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:14.300
But in between dinner and pie, things

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.500
started to lean towards politics talk.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.020
And I went and played Legos with the.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.460
Because he wanted more pie.

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:21.660
No, I had a fair amount of pie.

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.620
He wanted a bigger piece of pie.

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:29.660
Yeah, Dan, it was trickle down, cool whip.

01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:33.980
A lot of people think that if you put out more cool whip,

01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:36.020
it'll trickle down onto more pie.

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:36.620
It's not true.

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.220
It's not true.

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:38.500
No, I'll eat it all.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:42.700
But Church is a genius because she's like Spock.

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.140
You're a logic junkie.

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.340
And you can take your dad out.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.220
She took him out for an hour outside, smoked cigarettes.

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.220
Or you smoked, he vaped.

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:56.140
And they came back in, and you had fucking.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:57.060
And I had fixed him.

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:58.900
You had sorted him out.

01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:00.140
Sorted him out.

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.420
Temporarily.

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:02.340
Wait, explain.

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:05.380
How tangible was this fix?

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:08.100
Well, most people, when they talk to my father,

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.380
and I've noticed this online, too,

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.460
and this happens with my uncle and my cousins,

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:16.980
is people react really emotionally to the obviously

01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:18.940
heinous shit that they're saying, the excuses they're

01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:20.700
making for things that are inexcusable.

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:23.220
And the truth is, is that everything

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:26.180
keeps coming back to this but Hillary argument.

01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:29.580
And the reason is, is that all of those excuses,

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:32.700
all of those defending of Roy Moore's and all this crap

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.980
that's happening right now is really just

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:38.020
a defending of the decision they made to vote for someone

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:39.420
because they hate Hillary.

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:42.100
It's got nothing to do with him as a president

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.900
or anything that's happening.

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:47.340
And especially with my father being the military guy,

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.780
he's got this notion of the greater good that also

01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:51.940
comes from a military, like, well, war is ugly

01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:53.660
and things are terrible, and you've

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:54.620
got to get through it.

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.700
And you know that some things are going to be bad,

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:59.060
but in the long run, it's all going to be better.

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:04.380
And that's how he judges Roy Moore's right now.

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.420
Because it's for the greater good in his eyes,

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.660
because we had to do this because Hillary.

01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.380
We were avoiding this horrible thing.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.100
And I think that that's a lot of people and their perspective.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.460
And they saw everybody dancing the streets about hope

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:19.260
and change, Obama's election, and then,

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:22.260
as a matter of historical economic course,

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:25.580
their lives didn't get better.

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:28.340
And so that obvious connection is made there.

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.940
Otherwise, if you're not a politician,

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.340
It's like Sarah Palin's like, how's

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.180
all that hope and changey stuff going for you?

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.220
And everyone's like, yeah, actually.

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.700
We indoctrinate everybody into this dichotomy system

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.500
where we go like, OK, here's the Rockham Robot,

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.260
here's the Sockham Robot, and then.

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:51.180
And I mean, this idea that we have to defend not voting

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:55.820
for Hillary, it's kind of like a macrocosm of saying

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.940
at the emergency room, like, now, honey, you know,

01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.700
like, you made me do that.

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.380
Well, my dad literally at one point goes, well,

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.500
I didn't start it, and I was like, what are you, five?

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.460
And he starts laughing.

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:08.700
You know, I didn't want to do that.

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:09.820
What's going on right now?

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:11.700
Like, I'm like, you just keep saying,

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.660
you keep going back to this saying.

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:15.900
And at a certain point, you've got to realize, like,

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:17.460
that's over, that's done.

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.980
No one's trying to take away from you

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:23.020
your rationale for why you voted the way you did for this piece

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:26.460
of human garbage, because you were throwing the dice.

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:30.340
But now that he's president, judge him for what he's doing.

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:32.700
And he was like, yeah, OK, you know, you're maybe right.

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:36.500
And I'm like, OK, so like, if I actually understand,

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:41.900
and I go like, OK, I think I know why you're making arguments

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:44.380
that I know that you don't even believe right now.

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:46.220
Like, I know why you're making the excuses

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:47.380
that you're making right now.

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.380
It's like, I know that you don't think

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:53.060
that it's OK for a 32-year-old man to fuck a 14-year-old.

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:55.780
So why is my father saying that right now?

01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:58.340
Oh, it's because he's defending the indefensible,

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.660
because he has an idea of some kind of greater good

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.340
and some greater battle that's happening right now.

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:04.980
And he's making excuses.

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.500
In his mind, I would say some of the people

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:10.500
who are defending Roy Moore.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.580
Careful, he's a friend.

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.540
They might.

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:14.660
Big friend of the show, too.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.780
I had no interest in defending Al Franken.

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:20.740
And then I read that one article that was like,

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:26.060
wait, if Franken gets yanked from the picture,

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.100
this is a blow against net neutrality.

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:31.100
And then I was like, then that, because I don't care

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.340
if a senator gets fucking hauled up

01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:36.100
to the Robocop police station desk

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:40.420
and forced to fucking account for being a,

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.620
they woke up committing a crime if they're a politician.

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:43.700
This is America.

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:45.180
If you're a politician, you should already

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.580
be suspected of everything.

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:48.420
And you should wake up with shame,

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.380
because you're getting paid to do fucking jack shit.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.300
You're a parasite.

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:55.140
Sorry, but it's a cushy gig.

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:56.380
You're a fucking politician.

01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:57.900
Eat my dick.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.620
And wake up every morning in a world

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.780
where you have to prove that you're not a criminal.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:02.860
You're a politician.

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.980
But then I was like, oh shit, net neutrality.

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:06.900
God damn it.

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.500
Is this a goddamn conspiracy?

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.580
This Republican woman.

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.780
Wait, there's the picture of him doing the titty honk,

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:13.300
but his fingers aren't touching her.

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.700
You can see shadows under them.

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.220
My mom and I were bonding about this.

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:17.500
You can see shadows under them.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:18.260
He's not touching.

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.740
It's a just, the only other thing is her story about tongues.

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:23.540
And then she got fucked up.

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:25.900
Anyone watching this from the outside would start to go,

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.740
what would look at me and go, boy, you Democrats,

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.900
you'll do anything to, you just love violating women.

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.540
Well, and I think that this brings up

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.460
a really valuable point of discussion

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.060
where we need to not have it in 140 characters

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.100
or we need to actually talk to each other about this shit.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:46.900
But the unavoidable truth that we as people on the left

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:51.380
can do and should hold ourselves to a higher account

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:52.660
than people on the right.

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:56.260
And you don't see Roy Moore getting this much pressure

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.260
from the right.

01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:00.820
And that's not good that the right's doing that.

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.260
We shouldn't, like there's no answer to this right now,

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:06.260
but it's something to really talk about and think about.

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.780
But again, remember, I think that it's because inherently

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:13.780
they're trying to defend their guy and their party right now.

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.820
And they're constantly having to do that.

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.900
So every time one of theirs goes down,

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:24.860
they're like, fuck, we gotta make every excuse,

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.340
we gotta find a way, they're lying or whatever it is,

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:28.980
we're on the left, we're going,

01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:32.540
I'm not mad at the women who accuse Al Franken.

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.780
I'm like disappointed in Al Franken.

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.660
And I'm going like, God damn, we need you, you know,

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.660
like God, how many others might have fucked up.

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:41.060
But if you're really into net neutrality,

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.620
you might even be, you might even start to go

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:44.860
over the weekend, I started to go,

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:46.420
is this a conspiracy?

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.900
Right, well, it's happening though.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.780
Which is now I'm defending a sexual,

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:52.460
now you're just the same,

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.580
like it's the same magical thinking.

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.060
And it's like, yeah.

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.020
Now I'm a zealot.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.940
My guys are all infallible

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:01.380
because we're the guys with the white hat on

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:02.700
and your guys are all garbage

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.100
because they have the black hat on

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.860
because we think that good and evil

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.060
is a black and white thing.

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:09.540
And if you look at like the board,

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.860
if you look at the whole chess board,

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:13.900
the right has won all three branches of government.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.020
The FCC is probably gonna like fucking.

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.020
Yeah, there's nothing we can do.

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:18.060
There's nothing we can do.

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:19.940
We should fight, but there's nothing we can do.

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.500
Like we should absolutely try,

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:25.300
but Al Franken isn't gonna change much, I think.

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.900
If you really like pull back

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:28.900
and look at how much power the right has.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.060
And to your point, which is a really good point,

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:34.220
I think that part of this is like these people

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:38.140
are conditioned on all sides to come at this defensively.

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:40.580
Like, and that's a problem of the media.

01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:42.540
That's a problem of online discourse.

01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:45.300
That's a problem with the way in which we talk

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:48.340
about politics because we get too emotionally invested.

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:50.100
Well, and it's the way we talk about each other too,

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.500
because dehumanization is, I think,

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:53.940
at its worst point right now.

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:57.580
And by dehumanization, like, for me,

01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:00.820
you know, it's all about the other, right?

01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:04.260
And the other would be anybody who's so different

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:08.780
from your way of being that they are not human anymore,

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:11.220
to you, like, because you can't form empathy for them,

01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:13.100
whether that's like, and right now,

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.660
that's as simple as being a Democrat and a Republican.

01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:19.460
It's as simple as driving a Prius instead of a Ford F-150.

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:20.300
Yeah.

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:23.140
Like, that's literally, that's enough for people to say,

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:24.780
oh, you're not a man.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:27.620
Let's make it even simpler because let's talk about

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:30.420
25-year-olds who can't afford a Prius or a Ford F-150

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:32.180
aren't making that decision, and therefore,

01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:34.740
those decisions are actually ideological for them.

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:37.380
And every day, for better or for worse,

01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:40.180
whether they should be doing it or not,

01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.980
these people are living online.

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:46.980
And every, and their chimpanzee spinal cords

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:50.860
are jacked up by these interactions they're having.

01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:52.340
I just did it today.

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:55.220
I'm a 44-year-old grown-ass man.

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.180
I've gotten one fight with my girlfriend

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.860
while traveling, this entire Thanksgiving,

01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:00.780
all these connecting flights, all this stress.

01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:02.060
We even high-fived each other

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.700
and even knew we were jinxing it.

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:04.540
We didn't fight.

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:05.460
We traveled as a couple.

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:06.540
We didn't fight.

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:10.540
We had one kerfuffle and it was absolutely centered around,

01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:12.380
I got on Twitter.

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:22.340
The important thing seems to be that the way

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:27.340
that the internet is, the nature of it favors,

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.860
I'm just gonna use simple language.

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:31.500
It favors Nazis.

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.940
It does not favor hippies.

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.420
If you want people to be happy,

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:42.420
you are having to overcome obstacles on the internet.

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:44.540
If you want people to be angry,

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:47.060
if you want people to be afraid,

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:49.220
every step you take, it's like you're on one

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:52.060
of those airport conveyor belt things

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:55.580
where every step you take takes you five steps further

01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:59.820
and the left is walking against it

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.180
because technology, until we figure out a way

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.340
to add a wire to the internet cables

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:07.980
that makes you feel what the other person is feeling,

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:11.940
it's like we're in this pool together

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:13.100
and we're just going like,

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.340
oh, I want everybody to be happy

01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.340
and it kind of touches on your thing

01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.380
and I don't know if it's a good thing to use.

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.780
We should use this as an example though

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.500
because it's like you're clearly,

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:23.900
you're on a blue streak.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.340
You're a charismatic, amazing voice to have out there.

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:29.420
You're a comedian that is a dedicated socialist

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:32.420
and maybe I'm just drunk or maybe I like you,

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.740
but it's like, wow, you're a weapon

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:40.740
in the arsenal of making this shit work

01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:44.300
and yet through no one's fault really,

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.780
except for the way we operate

01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:49.060
versus how the enemy operates,

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.860
you had to resign from an official position

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:56.020
because of a joke you made because we can't,

01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:57.900
if you're interested in equality,

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:02.820
you can't, that doesn't merge well with jokes.

01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:07.420
The less tolerance is being used against us right now.

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:08.260
And we're also-

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:11.140
The fact that we stand for all of that equality

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:13.140
and we want everything to be like fair

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:15.780
and all of these things that they call us a snowflake for

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:19.460
is absolutely being used against us, particularly online.

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:22.100
And then the moment that we get as ugly as they do

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:24.460
and go, okay, let's tussle in the mud then,

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:26.060
let's get down and dirty here,

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.820
they go, whoa, look who's triggered

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:31.260
and where's your tolerance now?

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:32.620
So much for the tolerant left.

01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:34.460
So much for the tolerant left.

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:35.780
Look at you, you're all mad.

01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:37.180
It's so easy to trigger these things.

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.660
And also in the meantime,

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.580
you guys can't even get along with each other.

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:41.420
Right.

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:43.340
Look at all these women arguing with each other

01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:44.940
about blah, blah, blah, what do you expect us

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:45.780
to take this seriously?

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.140
You guys can't even stop pillow fighting about this.

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:50.140
It's just condescending.

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.900
Look, you're not an army.

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:55.540
Well, to the point specifically about my thing,

01:19:55.540 --> 01:20:00.300
I fucked up in allowing ammo for that.

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:03.140
I tweeted a thing, a Bill Cosby joke

01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:06.100
that now I agree with people,

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:07.860
like it was right after the Weinstein thing

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.780
and no woman needs to go online

01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:11.780
and see some fucking white dudes posing

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:13.460
with Bill Cosby's star.

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.220
I see how people would be upset.

01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:18.460
And I gave them a context free way

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:20.180
for everybody to get mad at me.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:21.700
From the right to the left, like,

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:24.660
oh, you're a fucking pussy for apologizing and resigning.

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:26.260
Oh, you know, like, how dare you?

01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:30.820
And truly, I, as a, I'm not a politician.

01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:31.980
I thought I was a politician.

01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.740
I thought that I could be in this position

01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.860
where you're going to be judged so harshly

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:38.660
on everything you say and everything you say

01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.220
represents this group.

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:42.140
And I made it very clear in that moment,

01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:43.340
no, I don't want to do that anymore.

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:46.580
I don't want to have the DSA's reputation

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.860
on the hook for me because I'm a comedian

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:52.500
and I'm a writer and so I inherently take certain risks

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:53.660
and fall on my face.

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:55.380
And when I do that in front of a crowd,

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:57.780
40 to 100 people don't like me.

01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:00.180
But when I do it on Twitter as the face of the DSA,

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:03.220
that could bring down the left if, you know,

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:04.740
weaponized correctly.

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:07.220
And so I see where things, you know,

01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:09.180
where it made a lot of sense for me to resign.

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.620
On the other side of that spectrum,

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:14.100
like you said, if you know who I am

01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:17.940
and you know the context, nobody in the local chapter

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:21.820
that knows me got super upset with that,

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:24.380
nobody who is like my friend,

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.100
nobody who knows that I was making a reference

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:28.420
to taking Confederate statues down,

01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.420
knows that I led a charge to get the Confederate statue

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.780
taken down at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:37.740
But that's my fuck up for giving them this ammo.

01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.420
So we, like especially within our leadership,

01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:42.740
need to hold ourselves to an even higher standard.

01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:45.420
And so what I want to do now is sort of just be

01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:47.980
a little bit more of a Steve Bannon, but good,

01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:51.060
where you can help people say things

01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:53.380
and take what is the internet,

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:54.580
what is the internet good for?

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:58.940
I think it's good for like radicalizing and ideology.

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.020
And you see podcasts-

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:01.340
And it's bad for that too.

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:04.260
Well, it's bad for that if it's bad ideology.

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:08.980
It's good pure, like morally ambiguous radicalization,

01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:11.460
whether it's for ISIS or for the good guys.

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.340
Like the internet can do that.

01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:15.540
And I think the Democrats, and a big reason

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.140
why I'm upset with the Democrats,

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.980
is that they won the culture war,

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:22.180
but they seeded the ideological battle

01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.620
for no fucking reason.

01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:26.420
They got rid of union halls, which was the one place

01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:29.700
where people, like poor people, people of color,

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.980
working class people, met up and talked face to face.

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:35.980
And then on the internet, all it is is fucking gifts

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:38.860
and the West Wing and Harry Potter references.

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:41.460
There's no, there's no ideology.

01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:43.860
And that's what socialism and specifically,

01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:46.580
for me, democratic socialism gives me,

01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.460
is it gives me this fuel to understand,

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:51.500
oh, this is happening because of this.

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:54.820
I know, because this guy that I like fucking told me this,

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:57.700
or this woman who rules taught me this thing

01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.260
just by watching her do it.

01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:00.100
Well, so, okay.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.940
So I know you're saying, like, first and foremost,

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:06.260
consider getting off the internet more and more.

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.420
Yeah.

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:08.780
It will always be there.

01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:09.980
It runs everything.

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:12.260
You can get caught up within a moment.

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:14.620
You could spend an entire week off of Twitter

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.620
from my experience, and not a lot has changed.

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.900
That's not the same as telling you

01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:20.700
you're wrong for currently being on it,

01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:22.140
or anything like that.

01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:24.180
Order to tune out and stop being informed, either.

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:26.780
That's not tuning out and stopping being informed.

01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:27.620
Yeah.

01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:30.260
And so, but, however, and then there's,

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.100
so there's that, it's like everybody experiment

01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:34.460
with like, start spending more time in the real world

01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:35.940
and blah, blah, blah.

01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:39.900
For those of us who are just gonna do tomorrow

01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:43.940
what we did yesterday, but wanna put like one tag

01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:47.860
for our tag cloud, one little piece of awareness

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.340
on how we spend tomorrow.

01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:54.100
And sadly, we're gonna spend tomorrow texting, tweeting,

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:58.220
posting, reacting, commenting, arguing, fighting,

01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.860
getting mad, getting scared.

01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.180
Acquiescing to that saying,

01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:04.820
that's how we're gonna behave tomorrow.

01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:07.300
What's, is there some kind of little algorithm,

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:10.420
some kind of little call to consciousness

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.420
that harms nothing, threatens nothing,

01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:15.420
demands almost nothing.

01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.260
Just.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.100
Yes.

01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:19.460
Every interaction, everything you see online,

01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:21.420
every way that you're reacting to it internally

01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:23.860
and every conflict you start getting in

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:28.020
on a comment section, like, is there some kind of.

01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:30.780
So what I've done personally that's really helped me

01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:35.180
is you have to recognize that national media

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:40.180
focuses on national storylines that you can't affect.

01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:44.860
You can't change this huge thing.

01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.260
So what I've done is I've stopped watching cable news.

01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:51.620
Cable news, inherently, it's only there to scare you

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.340
and make you buy, you know, fucking Centrum Silver

01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:55.780
or whatever.

01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:58.860
And to delegitimize fringe voices

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:01.300
in favor of corporate status quo.

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.140
Absolutely.

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:02.980
But where am I gonna find out

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.500
whether or not I can sue somebody for Mesocilioma?

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.620
Game show network.

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:08.940
Okay.

01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:11.420
I mean, the Game Show Network is the only channel I watch

01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:12.980
and that's what you should do.

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:13.820
No whammies.

01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:16.700
These fuckers want you to sue somebody

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.020
for Mesocilioma.

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:18.860
It's crazy.

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:19.700
They're gonna find you.

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:20.780
Are you suggesting though,

01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:23.540
because it's like suggesting that people.

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:27.820
Pay attention to Trump in only how he can entertain you

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:28.940
by being an idiot.

01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.780
Is there a way to start shifting over

01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.660
for all of us Facebook, Twitter addicted,

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.420
Tumblr addicted, everybody like so.

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:36.300
We could shift over to local.

01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.940
These things all have local.

01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:40.980
Yes, roots and it all starts at the local level.

01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:44.660
So there is a DSA chapter or PSL,

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:46.700
which is the party for socialism and liberation.

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.740
There are progressive groups.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.460
If you don't have like a socialist,

01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:53.820
like find the most left most people in your community.

01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.380
You can follow groups on Twitter.

01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:56.220
Yeah.

01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:57.060
Are the local.

01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:00.340
Yeah, DSA Los Angeles, DSA, you know.

01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:02.700
And then your Twitter feed is gonna be injected

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:07.020
with a little bit of, oh, the Los Feliz Boulevard.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:10.820
This is happening there at the corner of this and that.

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.460
You're gonna go, whoa, let's just down the block

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:13.300
from my house.

01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:14.140
Exactly.

01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.980
And that might start a kind of,

01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:19.500
you might actually decide one day you got nothing to do

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.020
and like you know the address they're talking about.

01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.060
You know the shopping center

01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:25.860
that where this is happening and that.

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:28.980
Right, so what'll happen is like an account,

01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:31.260
a DSA account or one of these other leftist accounts

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.820
will retweet about a state bill.

01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:37.620
And a state, like state bills are where power is

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:38.460
in your state.

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:42.180
Like we live in a country that allows a lot of states rights.

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:44.900
There was a big fight about it a couple hundred years ago.

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:45.740
But what.

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:48.460
I generally disagree with it, but it's what we have.

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:49.420
Which is what we have.

01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:54.420
And so using what we have, we can look at a situation.

01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:58.500
Have you, have any of you ever called a state representative?

01:26:58.500 --> 01:26:59.580
Yeah, a couple times.

01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:02.060
Oh wait, no, no, that's not a U.S.

01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:05.740
Not a U.S. congressman, not a Senator, a state rep.

01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:08.060
Right, the only people that call state senators

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:10.780
are like, excuse me, my mailman's two Chinese.

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:11.620
You know what I mean?

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.580
Like they're the craziest people in the world.

01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:15.900
And there are these really important bills

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:18.180
going through California, for example,

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:20.660
has Medicare for all bill that's been shelved,

01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:23.620
but with enough popular pressure could be brought back.

01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:26.700
These people, like when you call your state representatives,

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.100
not your national representatives,

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:31.220
they're so happy to not be talking to a blind racist.

01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:34.340
To fucking Clint Eastwood in Grand Torino.

01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.100
Because those are the people who call.

01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:39.980
And your efforts, you know, it takes fucking,

01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:41.940
it takes effort to go into lunch break

01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:43.260
and look up the number and fucking,

01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:44.460
because you're working all the time

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:47.180
to find the phone number to call for Nancy Pelosi

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:48.420
to just ignore you.

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:49.820
Or fucking Dianne Feinstein

01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:51.500
to not even fucking pick up the phone.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.340
Oh yeah.

01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.700
And literally, there was somebody in LADSA

01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:58.660
that sent a pizza with pepperoni spelling out

01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:00.780
like our message to them because they wouldn't,

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:03.580
there was like, don't confirm,

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.820
what's the guy that looks like the Kebler Elf?

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:06.660
Sessions.

01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:07.500
Dennis Kucinich?

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.340
Oh, dating myself.

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:10.260
Yeah, it's like, you know,

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:12.100
to get through to those people so hard,

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:15.300
but you as an individual, look at where your power lies.

01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:17.900
Your power lies in your community.

01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:20.620
And so if you just change the trajectory

01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:24.500
and make a call a week about an issue

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.860
that it's like, look and see what state measures

01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:27.700
are going on.

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:28.540
But it also might be helpful to say,

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.180
your life lies at the local level.

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:31.020
Yes.

01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:33.940
Like if you actually become one of these people,

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:36.540
and I think we've encountered old people that we kind of,

01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:37.500
we're like, what's with them?

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:39.820
Like they're so passionate about the fucking twigs

01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:41.540
and gathering on the street corners or whatever.

01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:44.500
Like, well, become the cool version of one of those people.

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.540
And you'll be following your comfort level

01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.340
because it's your neighborhood.

01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:51.580
And you'll also like, because I think also it's like,

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:52.940
if you're thinking the whole time,

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:55.780
well, I'm gonna hand this blanket or this tail light

01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:56.620
to this person.

01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:59.140
And in so doing, I'm gonna take down Trump.

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:00.900
You're gonna get frustrated every time you come home

01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.220
to 900 Trump tweets.

01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.060
Exactly.

01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.020
And feel like you're acting in futility.

01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:07.180
But all right.

01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:08.780
Well, goddamn, I mean.

01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:10.580
And one last thing, if you don't mind.

01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:11.980
Yeah, go for it.

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:14.100
And also like fucking talk.

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:15.020
What the?

01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:15.780
Jesus.

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:17.380
Oh, shit.

01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:20.820
Jeff's a secret alt-right agent

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:23.300
who's trying to undercut your message.

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:27.620
I've said this before, but like the reason the Tea Party won

01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:30.020
is because they serve tea.

01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:32.620
They don't watch prestige television and they don't fuck.

01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:34.340
Like that's the reason why they won.

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:37.540
They, all they do is this.

01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:41.540
But there are so many fewer of them than there are us.

01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:43.580
So if we just do a little bit,

01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:45.580
and you can still fucking watch the deuce,

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.940
James Franco's surprisingly good in it.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.420
And you can still watch fucking,

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:51.100
well, you know, whatever shows you wanna watch

01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:53.700
or be on Bumble or fucking whatever,

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:55.140
but just like once a week,

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.660
just like look and see what's going on in your community

01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:58.500
and do that.

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.180
And if enough of us give,

01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:02.100
I mean, that's what socialism's all fucking about.

01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:03.980
It's enough of us working a little bit

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:07.340
so that the rest of us don't have to work super fucking hard.

01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:09.260
And I think that fundamentally is the way

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:11.260
that we need to look at the world.

01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:12.100
All right.

01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:15.300
You can go to city, like public hearings and stuff too,

01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:16.900
like local government.

01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:19.340
I don't know, like on NPR, you always hear like,

01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:21.340
oh, it's 7 p.m. on a Tuesday.

01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:23.940
So we're gonna take you now to the Santa Monica City Hall

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:26.540
where a bunch of people are gonna get mad about parking.

01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:29.740
And like, you can be one of those people mad about parking

01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:31.820
and you can have a lot better ideas.

01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:33.780
And it's not like, well, I mean, it's the same thing

01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:36.580
about like these races calling like the state senators.

01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:38.340
It's like the people who go there

01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:41.580
are generally crazy old people with stupid concerns.

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.580
And I bet a lot of people are, you know,

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:45.500
willing to hear reasonable concerns

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.020
from less stupid people.

01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:48.740
And the proof of that right now

01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:51.860
is that like through a divest LA

01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:55.260
and definitely check out divest LA and public bank LA

01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:56.380
if you live in Los Angeles.

01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:58.620
And there's great public bank movements

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:01.500
in the Bay Area and all across the country.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.340
Like they did exactly that.

01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:06.180
They went to a local city council meeting

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:08.940
and various local neighborhood council meetings

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:10.540
and were like, hey, we have this idea

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:12.860
and it generated enough.

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:16.260
And this was directly in response to the pipeline shit,

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:19.100
the Dakota Access Pipeline Wells Fargo's involvement in that.

01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:24.020
And what happened was without any real like stalling

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:27.700
or anything like a smooth, smooth ride,

01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:31.260
the city council unanimously voted

01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.980
to divest $40 million from Wells Fargo.

01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:36.060
And it was just like a couple people

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:38.180
that like look like us that, you know.

01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:38.940
They just showed up.

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:40.980
That just showed up and we're like talking about it.

01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.860
And then, you know, next thing you know,

01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:45.380
the world is billions of dollars better.

01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:47.460
And that's where it counts.

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:49.620
It turns out we have good ideas.

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:50.340
Yeah.

01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:52.180
Well, I felt like my initial instinct was,

01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:56.580
okay, I'm going to have, I had my Eleanor Democrat on

01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:58.700
and I have my, I'm going to have the DSA on

01:31:58.700 --> 01:31:59.860
and I'm going to have Antifa on.

01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:01.100
I'm never going to have a Nazi on.

01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:04.460
I, I, but, but, you know, much as I met Spencer

01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:06.380
by asking, is there a dungeon master here?

01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:08.420
I feel like you're, you know,

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:10.420
you were not being indoctrinated into any cult

01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:14.620
or political party when we talk about acting locally

01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:15.460
and all this stuff.

01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:20.460
And, and you're very charismatic and, and, and unthreatening.

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:23.460
You're definitely de-coagulating my defense mechanisms.

01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:26.060
And therefore, let's say you're LA based, right?

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:26.900
Yeah.

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:28.980
Let's have you back sooner than later

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:31.940
because let's start the conversation at like,

01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:32.900
what should we do?

01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:36.460
Like, like locally because then like locally can mean

01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:38.060
locally everywhere that everyone's watching

01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:43.060
and it doesn't, Jesus Christ, he hates, he hates progress.

01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:44.540
He loves symbols.

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:47.340
But, and so let's give us one more time.

01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:50.740
I guess maybe the website, if people want to just start.

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:51.580
Yeah.

01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.900
I mean, dsausa.org is the national website.

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:59.900
You can follow dsa on Twitter, on dsaLA is dsa-la.org.

01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:03.460
But I encourage you, I'm not here to tell you

01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:04.980
just to join the DSA.

01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:07.020
Those are the people that I found that.

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:08.820
Most importantly, because I think the biggest thing

01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:10.180
that's gonna trigger people is like,

01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:12.940
we're not, we're not Bernie Broen necessarily here.

01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:15.860
No, and there are people that are, you know, okay.

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:20.300
So the thing that made me join is I went with a friend

01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.780
of mine to a meeting right after the election

01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:26.020
and I was like, you know, I'll give these guys a shot.

01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:26.860
Let's see what happens.

01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:29.380
And I saw a bunch of fucking white dudes with glasses

01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:30.900
and various forms of facial hair

01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:32.700
that look like they listen to podcasts all the time.

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:33.780
And I was like, okay, okay.

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:35.780
It's like a bunch of guys like me or whatever.

01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:39.460
And then the person that was leading the meeting,

01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:42.100
the chair at the time was this amazing,

01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:44.820
witchy old woman named Carol, who I love,

01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:47.140
who is like one of the greatest women

01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:48.900
in the history of politics.

01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:52.420
She flipped over a bus during an anti-Vietnam protest

01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:54.220
and just kept the seat warm.

01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:55.860
Because her baby was under it.

01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:56.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:58.660
That's why she had the magic of the power.

01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:01.940
I don't approve of female strength on physical levels.

01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:02.780
No, no, no.

01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:05.420
She's a regular she-hulk and she,

01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:10.300
so she said like, okay, who's here,

01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.180
who doesn't really necessarily vibe with DSA

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:15.300
but is just here for, you know, just to see what's up.

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:18.180
And this guy came up and he was like, I'm a Democrat

01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:20.620
and I am not gonna change that at any time.

01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:22.500
He was like an older man and he was like,

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:25.860
I just wanna be somewhere and with a group of people

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.340
that can help point me in the right way

01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:29.060
to help change the Democratic Party,

01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:31.060
is it okay if I'm in here?

01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:33.460
And there were like kind of like snickers,

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:34.620
like, you know, a little bit.

01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.660
And then Carol walks up and goes,

01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:39.020
now I'm sure a lot of you disagree with this tactic.

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.140
I'm sure a lot of you disagree

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:43.580
with working within the Democratic Party

01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:44.660
and we're like nodding our heads.

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.940
And she's like, how many of you are willing to do the work

01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:49.420
that he's gonna do in the Democratic Party?

01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:51.660
And we were all like, not me.

01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:55.100
And she's like, right, so we have a big tent

01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:57.340
where it's called a big tent organization

01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:00.140
where if no matter what your level involvement is,

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.020
no matter what your politics are,

01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:04.740
if you want to help locally on issues

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:07.820
that I guarantee you you agree with,

01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:10.540
everything from like, hey, maybe we shouldn't put spikes

01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:13.820
under overpasses so homeless people can't live

01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:16.540
in under our precious overpasses,

01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:19.540
Mitch O'Farrell, city council person of Los Angeles.

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:23.740
Like, you'll find that.

01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:26.220
And then beyond that, you'll be able to find,

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:28.180
like we don't just, we're not on a amorphous blob.

01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:30.060
We have our housing and homelessness committee,

01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:34.060
which is focused on doing things like street watch,

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:37.540
which cops go and illegally fuck up homeless encampments.

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:39.940
People that have a job and a computer and a phone

01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:42.660
and are right there ready to get a fucking apartment,

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:44.020
they'll go in and bust all their shit

01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:45.940
and break all their shit completely illegally.

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.300
So we have a couple people who are comfortable

01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:49.740
waking up at four in the morning

01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:51.700
when we have a Google number, gets called

01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:53.060
and says there's a sweep coming

01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:54.660
and they just stand there with their phones

01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:57.620
and they just videotape and the cops don't fuck with people.

01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:59.740
So like, if that interests you, you can do that.

01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:03.380
If you're into healthcare, if you're into prison abolition,

01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:05.940
who's doing a lot of great work with our mutual aid,

01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:07.220
group on the taillight benefit,

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:09.100
like all of, there's all these different causes.

01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.260
And maybe just maybe if what you're really good at

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:14.140
is sitting in your, in front of your computer

01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:16.660
and following your kind of anger and outrage

01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:19.820
and trolling people, there might even be a job for you

01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:22.460
that actually ends, you know, you can use those skills

01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:24.300
if you wanna feel like you're fucking with people.

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:25.940
You know what's the best thing in the world?

01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:27.900
Fucking real life trolling.

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:30.820
We ruined Mayor Garcetti's election party

01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:34.620
because he was capitulating with Trump and not,

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:37.460
he wasn't calling Los Angeles a sanctuary city,

01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:39.540
which by the way, it still fucking isn't.

01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:42.300
And so he was letting our,

01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:44.180
because he wants the Olympics so fucking bad,

01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:47.580
he was letting the cops work hand in hand with ICE

01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:48.620
and fuck people over.

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:50.220
There was this big story that I'm not sure

01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:51.900
if you remember in Highland Park

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.540
where a dude was literally dropping his daughter off.

01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:56.260
He had a DUI 40 years ago.

01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:57.940
It's the only crime he ever committed.

01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:59.580
And he was just snatched.

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:00.740
It's one of the first ones.

01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.140
Yeah, Romulo was his name.

01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:04.980
And he luckily because of public pressure was let out.

01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:08.100
But in response to this, we used our anger

01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:12.060
and we found out, well, shit, the mayor is getting elected

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:13.780
in what is gonna be a landslide.

01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:15.140
Might as well be running on a post.

01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:16.180
He's throwing a big party.

01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:18.860
It's a boring election with a lot of press.

01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:20.460
Let's go fuck it up.

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:23.260
And so a hundred of us showed up and started yelling

01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:25.420
about getting ICE out of Los Angeles.

01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:28.900
And we had people infiltrate and interrupt his speech.

01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:30.860
And then what ended up happening was people

01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:32.660
that worked for the mayor came out to us

01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:34.580
like during the party, like kind of were like,

01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:36.700
hey, keep doing stuff like this, please.

01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:38.740
Because we never get pressure from the left.

01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:40.100
It's always pressure from the right.

01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:43.220
And so we kept pressuring on and granted,

01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:44.300
this wasn't our idea.

01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:47.660
We had groups like that organized and documented people

01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:51.060
that are on the front lines who can't go be

01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:53.860
so fucking confrontational with the mayor.

01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:56.220
But we as a group of mostly white people

01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:59.820
can use our privilege to amplify their voices

01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.140
and put ourselves in the way of jail time,

01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:03.260
which they're not gonna arrest a bunch

01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:04.540
of fucking white people.

01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:06.460
Like that's just not how cops work.

01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:09.380
And so we yelled and we yelled and we yelled and we yelled

01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:12.660
and two weeks later, he passed special order 40,

01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:17.140
which makes it so that no Los Angeles city official

01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.740
can collaborate with ICE.

01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:22.740
And it's like, that's trolling that fucking works.

01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:25.580
That's just you being, we literally did the Simpsons,

01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:30.660
Eric, Eric, while he was getting his fucking makeup on.

01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:32.180
And it was fun and-

01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:33.500
And there may be people out there that don't,

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.980
they're like, well, I don't wanna do that.

01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:36.940
I don't wanna be a troll and all that stuff.

01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:38.460
And so there's, but there's-

01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:41.140
You can give low income women rides to abortion clinics

01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:42.140
because people do that too.

01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:43.100
There's every personality.

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:45.060
It's like when you start, when you run a TV show,

01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:49.140
you go like, there's people who love writing fanfic,

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:52.540
like 500 pages of what if stuff.

01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:55.620
There's people who just, who hate those people,

01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:57.180
but they can love the same TV show.

01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:00.500
I'm translating this into my own fucking narcissistic thing.

01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:04.860
So anyways, I hate to, I don't wanna be the guy

01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.700
that cuts off the guy that's passionate

01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:09.140
and is doing good by talking.

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:11.540
But if we cut into D&D time,

01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:14.420
we'll be undercutting the entire DSA.

01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:16.420
They'll be the reason we didn't play D&D.

01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:20.060
But let's resolve that, whether it's like a segment,

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:23.140
you come back for 10 minutes per show or whatever

01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:28.140
and help me reform myself as a locally active person.

01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:33.060
I'm too drunk, I'm making too many promises.

01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:35.700
But something where we have you back very soon,

01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:38.300
I really appreciate your willingness,

01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:41.460
especially in light of how, you know,

01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.740
just hearing about your recent, like,

01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:46.820
kind of brush up against the PC thing

01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:48.260
and how that must fucking suck

01:39:48.260 --> 01:39:50.420
for somebody that just wants to be.

01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:54.100
You're a hero to me because you clearly care

01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:56.060
about this stuff enough to keep, like,

01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:00.540
plunging along and actually saying this shit, so.

01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:02.660
The movement's more important than me.

01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:05.340
And so, ultimately, the reason that I resigned

01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:07.260
is it was like, I don't want to be a wait on the movement.

01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:09.540
That's a threshold I'd love to cross.

01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:11.380
And maybe you can help me in the way I'm, like,

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:13.660
you know, Brandon and Duncan, like, help me, like,

01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:15.620
stay positive instead of negative and stuff.

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:20.260
But so, let's go, thank you, Josh and Drosky,

01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:21.100
for coming by. Thank you.

01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:23.260
We'll see you again soon, and, uh...

01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:40.140
MUSIC

01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:43.540
Yeah, and just again, he's not officially

01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:46.060
a spokesperson for the DSA.

01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:49.620
He just, uh, they, again, didn't step up to the plate.

01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:51.980
If it gets your dander up, there might be a couple...

01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:53.980
Well, I'm sympathetic... Everything gets my dander.

01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.660
...if you're like, oh, I'm a Harmontown fan.

01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:58.780
I don't... I delineate that from politics.

01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:01.420
So, what I don't like is for my Harmontown episode

01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:05.220
to be entirely about, um, politics.

01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:07.860
I... Sure, I sympathize with that.

01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:08.900
I would submit to you.

01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:11.220
I do not know what Harmontown is supposed to be,

01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:14.220
which is why sometimes it is something

01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:16.060
that you find amazing.

01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:18.660
And I think there are probably some people

01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.100
that are orgasming right now,

01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:22.580
because we finally... We walked the walk a little bit

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:24.660
in terms of a booking and, like, holy shit,

01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:27.620
that was a... That was a signal to boost, I think,

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:30.020
because I've been babbling forever about, um,

01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:31.460
acting locally and all this shit,

01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:32.460
and I don't know how to do it.

01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:33.060
Yeah.

01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:34.780
And so making a friend that actually knows

01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:36.980
how to walk that walk is important to me.

01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:39.220
And what's important to me should be important to you.

01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:41.980
So, fuck you, Julie.

01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:43.340
Yeah, Julie.

01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:45.740
With your joint dangling from your mouth,

01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:49.140
thinking Harmontown's so great,

01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:53.060
but only when he raps about fucking my mama.

01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:54.260
Is Steve Levy here tonight?

01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:54.780
No.

01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:59.620
Which is why we need to replace him with...

01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:00.620
Shhh.

01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:01.620
Shhh.

01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:02.620
Shhh.

01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:03.620
Shhh.

01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:04.620
Shhh.

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:05.620
Shhh.

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:06.620
Shhh.

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:07.980
Let's bring Rob Schrab back up.

01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:09.980
Rob Schrab!

01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:12.460
Oh, yeah.

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:14.940
Almost there, I guess.

01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:18.020
Oh, shit.

01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:20.820
He put a chair on the stage.

01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:23.620
He's rolling about.

01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:27.340
Rob, since you have wheels, go get our character sheets

01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:28.940
for us, so you...

01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:33.460
Rob Schrab is going to devros his way across our stage.

01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:34.740
This might hurt him.

01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:44.580
Rob Schrab is nothing if not a showman.

01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:48.020
Rob Schrab, gathering up our character sheets.

01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:52.340
Going to hand Dan, Dan's character sheets.

01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:56.900
And just a side note, if you want to join the D&DSA,

01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:58.740
you can roll your character sheet.

01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:02.100
We're using standard point buy arrays.

01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:02.900
Oh, man.

01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:04.340
Scionic classes are off the table.

01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:06.100
I have an exciting thing to talk to you about,

01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:07.580
role-playing-wise.

01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:12.740
So this guy, who I talked to for, I guess, probably

01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:16.660
a hot Adderall vodka-induced hour and a half or so

01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:18.700
following one of our shows.

01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:21.100
And I was just talking to him about that Blacksburg Technical

01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:26.780
Research Center game, Space Time and Time Lords.

01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:28.140
Remember I babbled to you about that,

01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:30.140
like this role-playing game that I...

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:31.060
Anyways, he...

01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:32.340
Where you're playing yourself?

01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:32.860
He...

01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:33.460
Yes.

01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:33.860
OK.

01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:34.460
Where you play yourself.

01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:38.500
So this is a system where you approximate your own real life

01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.420
attributes.

01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:40.660
Is Rob going to play Steve?

01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:42.540
Is Rob playing Diarrhea Jr.?

01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.420
I mean, he'll do whatever he wants,

01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:46.580
regardless of what anyone attempts or desires.

01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:49.060
He certainly is doing it right now.

01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:53.060
If you haven't paid $5 a month for our subscription,

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:55.300
you're missing out on one of life's great treasures.

01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:57.420
This has mostly been a non-visual show,

01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:00.980
but these couple of minutes are certainly

01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:03.780
a phenomenon unto itself.

01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.780
I'm really worried he's going to hurt himself.

01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:08.500
Like, he's just going to roll off the stage.

01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:09.980
I hope that happens.

01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:13.780
Like, that's the thing about a rolling chair on a platform.

01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:15.780
Like, one wheel goes off the edge,

01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:19.660
and I don't care if you're Jackie Chan, you're dead.

01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:25.980
But why are you on the side of that, you know?

01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:27.180
All right, let's have fun.

01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:28.060
We're all going to die.

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:32.740
Suspenser, Rob, are you going to play the role of Steve Levy

01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:33.260
after Diarrhea?

01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:35.180
Yeah, what do you want to do, Rob?

01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:36.260
Sure.

01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:37.500
Do you want to be an NBC?

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:38.260
What do you want to be?

01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:39.060
What?

01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:40.540
A non-player character.

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:44.580
I'll be a non-player character, because I'd like to see that.

01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:46.820
Were you disappointed when you came to the show

01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:47.780
and then there's a guy?

01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:51.780
It's like, I'm talking politics, and you're like,

01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.460
oh, I'm not going to come anymore.

01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:54.460
What are you talking about?

01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:56.580
No, I'm sharing my insecurities.

01:44:56.580 --> 01:44:58.060
Yeah, we want to know what you're feeling.

01:44:58.060 --> 01:44:59.500
I like it when you show up.

01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:04.540
I'm sorry, I've had a rough couple of days.

01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:05.740
Oh, wait, what do you mean?

01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:06.340
Why?

01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:07.860
Yeah, let's talk about that.

01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:10.620
I'll tell you about it later, but I'm fine.

01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:12.060
Is it lolly sick?

01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.060
No.

01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:13.820
Is Kate sick?

01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:16.300
No, no, no.

01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:19.100
Wait, what's going on?

01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:20.100
I'll talk.

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.540
No, it's not to the stage.

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:23.580
Oh, OK, it could be.

01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:24.140
What?

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:25.740
Let's act it out.

01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:27.380
OK.

01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:28.140
It's your boss.

01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:30.420
I'm really out of breath from doing all that.

01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:32.060
I was out of breath from dancing,

01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:33.540
and then I had to start rapping.

01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:36.740
And I was like, man, I can't even fucking breathe.

01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:39.020
It's a bummer.

01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:40.420
What a life.

01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:44.300
This mic is quieter than the others?

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.900
Well, it's because when you, but the genius thing is that the.

01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:49.820
Oh, because it's me?

01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:54.500
Well, no, the streamers, it's like,

01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:56.940
it's unmistakably a live performance.

01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:59.100
But then when you listen to it and I have,

01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:02.340
like, man, this goes to Zach and Chris, like, I mean,

01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:04.900
they're walking a fucking crazy tightrope.

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.420
They're recording streaming live audio

01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:09.100
that when you listen back to it, it

01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:10.900
sounds like a real podcast episode.

01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:12.860
Like, it's not compromised by the fact

01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:14.540
that we're doing it in a warehouse.

01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:18.780
But I think as performers, we benefit from visually

01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:21.460
from being in this space as opposed to the audio.

01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:23.420
But thank you for bringing it up so I can give props

01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:24.660
to our amazing engineers.

01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:29.500
I have a little bit of a business housekeeping question.

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:29.900
OK.

01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:30.940
Who farted?

01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:32.060
I don't know.

01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:34.500
It really smells like a fart.

01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:36.660
Oh, recently.

01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:39.460
Do you think it was Josh Andraski from the GSA?

01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:41.140
Or your girlfriend?

01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:43.500
That was a long time ago.

01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:44.620
This is a present fart.

01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:49.580
No, it wasn't me, because the minute you started going,

01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:51.100
I'd like to ask a question.

01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:53.220
I almost said, who farted?

01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:54.860
Oh, well, it had to be Josh then,

01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:56.020
because I didn't smell anything.

01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:57.420
So it had to be Josh.

01:46:57.420 --> 01:47:01.420
It's either Jeff in an incredible werewolf game

01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:02.740
level of manipulation.

01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:06.900
I would either not bring it up, or I would say, sorry,

01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:08.380
everybody, I farted all over.

01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:11.460
Using my werewolf skills that always get me taken out

01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:14.940
within the third round, I think that, yeah, I think Jeff did it.

01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:15.540
I didn't do it.

01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:16.100
I swear to God.

01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:17.500
I'm not accusing you of doing it.

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.060
I'm just saying that that's even more

01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:20.820
old world rules than that.

01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:23.540
Whoever smelt it, dealt it, I believe.

01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:26.940
And whoever denied it supplied it if I'm not mistaken.

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:30.580
Guys, somebody farted on me.

01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:32.220
Somebody farted on me.

01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:34.620
And I thought we all needed to address that.

01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:35.380
No, we should.

01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:37.740
But I'm just thinking about the options.

01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:40.100
And in my head, it's got to be one of you two.

01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:41.260
Well, it's certainly wrong.

01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:43.820
Well, if it was me, it'd be really obvious.

01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:45.180
Well, that's because I am.

01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:47.580
You were rolling around crop dusting.

01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:48.300
I didn't.

01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:49.020
I swear to God.

01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:49.260
I know.

01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:51.180
That's why it's too obvious to be you.

01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:52.660
That's why I think it must be Jeff.

01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:54.700
If I farted all over the stage, I would be the first to say,

01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:56.980
sorry, everybody, I sneak attack.

01:47:56.980 --> 01:48:00.220
I don't know if it's a fart, because it keeps on rolling,

01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:01.100
because as you.

01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:02.460
It could be like a Burbank thing.

01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:04.300
Yeah, I mean, as you've been talking,

01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:08.340
it's been kind of like wafted through a couple of times.

01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:10.700
It's been wafting and railing through the fucking stage.

01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:11.420
It could be the.

01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:13.500
Schrab was rolling around the stage.

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.500
Yeah, but I didn't.

01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:19.900
They start making the farts in Burbank, the early shift.

01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:20.860
That might be it.

01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:23.260
So then you can get your fresh Burbank farts.

01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:24.220
I swear to God, it wasn't me.

01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:24.820
It's 6 AM.

01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:25.900
I'm not blaming anybody.

01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:28.100
I just felt like somebody farted on my head.

01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:30.140
Do you remember the tannery?

01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:31.980
I was just in Milwaukee.

01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:33.580
Yeah.

01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:35.020
Milwaukee smells there.

01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:38.500
How was the college talk?

01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.420
My art school talk was great.

01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:41.140
Life changing.

01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:42.300
Did you like Dan's intro?

01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:42.980
Did you use it?

01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:43.740
Yes, I did.

01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:44.860
Everybody applauded.

01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:45.540
The full edit?

01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:48.660
No, he's the only non-rapping one.

01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:49.300
Yeah.

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.020
Well, that's, I mean, we just see that.

01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:51.820
The wraps were a failure.

01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:52.620
The wraps were a failure.

01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:53.380
They weren't a failure.

01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:54.580
They were just a different take.

01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:56.980
Did you use the wrap where he rhymed Bukake?

01:48:56.980 --> 01:48:57.460
No.

01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:57.940
No.

01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:58.440
OK.

01:48:58.440 --> 01:48:59.420
You didn't use any of the wraps.

01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:01.220
He used the verbal one.

01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:02.220
The verbal one.

01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:04.100
This guy is going to swivel in a chair

01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:05.620
and tell me he didn't fart on me.

01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:07.580
I did not fart on you.

01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:09.220
He just seems like that's guilty.

01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:12.580
If I farted on you, you would know.

01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:15.460
Because I'd be going, I don't know what you're talking about.

01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:18.980
$500.

01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:24.180
In Florida, as if they didn't have enough troubles,

01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:28.380
sometimes their tap water just smells like a fart.

01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:32.180
Outside my hotel, I was like, what's that fart smell?

01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:34.660
And then my parents would be like, well, that's just tide.

01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:35.780
Tide comes in, goes out.

01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:37.220
When it goes out, leaves dead stuff.

01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:38.580
Milwaukee, we're no stranger to that.

01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:39.860
The dead eel lives there.

01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:41.420
They smell like rotting fish.

01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:43.740
The tannery.

01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:47.700
But the tap water, I was brushing my teeth one morning,

01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:51.300
and then I brush my teeth, and then I go in, and I cup,

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:54.420
and I slurp my rinsing water out of the tap.

01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:56.820
What?

01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:58.380
Is this like the standing wiper thing?

01:49:58.380 --> 01:49:59.900
I'm going to find out I do the retrospective.

01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:01.460
We have 10 minutes to play D&D.

01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:04.060
So Spencer, you want to catch us up?

01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:04.940
Yeah.

01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:07.700
Honestly, what happened, you guys?

01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:09.380
Dan, do you remember anything that happened?

01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:12.020
I remember fighting zombies as we just

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:14.580
got to the town of Embershot.

01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:16.380
Yeah, I think what happened is you

01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:19.260
were just on the cusp of the town of Embershot,

01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:22.540
which whose name will be revealed.

01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:24.660
Great.

01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:26.420
I remember we fought the zombies.

01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:27.740
Yeah, sorry to listen to you.

01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:29.740
We were successful in fighting them in the sense

01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:33.020
that they either ran away or were killed.

01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:35.060
Yeah, that was all that happened, right?

01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:37.220
Because you set up that you were outside of the town.

01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:39.500
Yeah, that's what was confusing, as I was like,

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:40.780
did it more happen?

01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:42.540
And the answer was no.

01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:46.900
So last time, y'all found some zombies.

01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:48.780
There was music coming from a harp,

01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:54.020
and it kind of made the zombies bummed out.

01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:56.820
There was music bumming out the zombies and skeletons

01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:58.380
in a graveyard.

01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:00.660
And Diarrhea Jr. went to investigate

01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:03.220
the sound that was the music sound.

01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:06.300
And when he did, there was a burst of ruby light,

01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:08.220
and then the music stopped.

01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:11.740
And as if on cue, the zombies stopped being all bummed out

01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:16.180
and started just being generally mindless zombies,

01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:18.860
trying to end all life as we know it.

01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:23.300
And you guys, as clerics and members of the church militants,

01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:25.940
fought them and killed them.

01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:27.980
That was it, yeah.

01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:29.820
Combat takes a long time.

01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:30.700
Yeah.

01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:32.740
All right, so where are we standing right now?

01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:34.420
You're outside of the graveyard.

01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:38.300
You're standing over the white ashes of the skeleton

01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:41.700
that you cut down with your flame blade spell.

01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:42.180
All right.

01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:44.140
That was a fucking flame blade.

01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:47.300
Yeah, that was what Chad did.

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:54.100
So zombies, no more music, no more zombies.

01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:55.100
Well, nighttime.

01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:57.340
Looks like we got here either just in time

01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:04.580
or when I take off my mime glasses or too late.

01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:07.060
Yeah!

01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:08.180
Yeah.

01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:11.500
Won't get fooled again!

01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:15.060
Well, we got here in time to kill a bunch of fucking zombies.

01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:16.780
Yeah, but why are they running rampant?

01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:18.580
Where did that music come from?

01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:20.180
I mean, who knows?

01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:24.620
This could be, let's head into town.

01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:28.340
You know from your knowledge of religion, yeah, that's for you.

01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:28.700
Is it?

01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:30.220
Yeah, you can ask real questions.

01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:33.420
You're playing Levy's character, right?

01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:34.180
Yeah, what are you?

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:36.300
Well, that's not what we said before the music started.

01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:38.260
Well, we can clear up anything you want.

01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:39.460
I'm here to help and answer questions.

01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:41.620
You got to eat that mic, bro.

01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:43.780
This is not for everyone to hear.

01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:46.900
You got to eat that mic, bro.

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:52.020
Eat my fucking mic, Jeff.

01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:53.420
All right, I'm eating the mic.

01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:55.340
So what was your question?

01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:58.820
You asked me earlier, would I like to be Steve Levy's

01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:01.180
character or a new character?

01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:07.180
And then I said, I'd be a new game character, whatever.

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.300
You really gave him that option?

01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:10.340
No, I don't think that I did.

01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:11.380
No one gave you that option.

01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:12.660
I don't want to argue.

01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:15.540
All right, nobody remembered having that conversation.

01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:17.740
I don't want to offer to make a new character for you.

01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:18.660
OK, whatever.

01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:20.140
We're doing this.

01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:22.740
We've got seven minutes.

01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:26.140
All right, OK, so everybody just stand back.

01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:28.900
I'm going to, OK, what's this?

01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:31.460
I start kicking the bones that are in front of me.

01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:32.620
I start kicking it.

01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:34.380
I go, look at this.

01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:35.500
What a mess.

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:37.420
Look at the mess you made here.

01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:38.980
This is great.

01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:39.900
Terrific.

01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:41.340
Now what are we going to do?

01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:42.100
I'm going to play the game.

01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:42.900
What are we doing?

01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:45.980
One of those war movie things where it's like a PTSD thing

01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:49.700
and I'm going to cradle him and go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:50.580
Listen to me, man.

01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:51.900
You've got to look at me.

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:54.820
This world is magical.

01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:57.700
A lot of that magic is dark.

01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:00.260
All right, I've been through pain.

01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:01.780
I was raised by pain.

01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:03.540
We all met through a church.

01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:04.940
That church ain't perfect.

01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:07.460
We're here to clean up this town.

01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.780
Can't even remember where the fuck we're here.

01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:12.500
That's a great question to ask.

01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:13.300
Who said that?

01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:16.260
It was because of the, we're on the quest of Patchen's Jewel.

01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:19.740
The quest of Patchen's gem.

01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:24.780
A third party Linux quest that wasn't approved of.

01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:26.900
Well, it was approved of.

01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:27.540
Well, yeah.

01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:28.780
It's an open source quest.

01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:30.580
Yeah, I don't want to get into the minutiae.

01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:31.820
It was very complicated.

01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:34.740
We're on the quest of Patchen's.

01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:36.380
The quest for Patchen's gem.

01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:37.700
Patchen's gem.

01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:38.300
Yeah.

01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:41.300
Patchen's, who was your good friend and helped you out

01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:45.740
in Dome, Roan, he got robbed, in part,

01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:48.460
because you guys let him get stabbed a bunch.

01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:50.340
And we feel guilty about that, so we're

01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:51.460
going to go get this gem.

01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:52.860
We're going to get the gem back.

01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:54.860
Do we have to kill some zombies along the way?

01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:55.360
Yes.

01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:56.140
We fucking did.

01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:56.640
Yes.

01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:01.180
So now it's time to put the pedal to the mother.

01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:02.620
I'm going.

01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:04.700
You guys are, I'm going to start looking.

01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:07.580
I'm going to, I'm walking, I'm walking away.

01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:08.420
Walking towards the gem.

01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:09.420
I'll figure it out.

01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:10.820
I'll find it.

01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:12.460
I feel so bad about this, but I don't

01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.980
remember if Patchen's is with us.

01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:15.020
Patchen's is here, yeah.

01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:17.180
He didn't, he was kind of quiet in that last fight.

01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:18.180
But guys, here's the thing.

01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:20.820
Patchen's has been overtly critical of our ability

01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:22.740
to help him in the past, and we are not.

01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:23.860
We've proven him right.

01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:26.060
I feel like you put me in a position

01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:28.860
where honesty implies brutal criticality.

01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:31.180
I don't know that I want it to be in those situations.

01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:33.060
I'm saying to my party members, I'm going,

01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:40.340
guys, if the goal is to make Patchen's go out.

01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:44.220
I think our goal is, let's keep it simple.

01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:46.540
Let's, let's help Patchen's out.

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:48.020
Let's do one thing right.

01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:48.740
What?

01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:51.780
Patchen's, yeah.

01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:52.620
I have an idea.

01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:53.980
OK.

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:54.540
Here's the thing.

01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:55.860
We just got to a new town.

01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:58.620
There's no direct, like, linear mission.

01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:02.300
I think what we should do is we, the only people that

01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:06.060
have seen us together are zombies.

01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:06.560
They're dead.

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:08.660
They've fled.

01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:12.380
We should do that thing, like, in the beginning of the third,

01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:14.060
the return of the Jedi.

01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:14.660
OK.

01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:18.420
We show up one by one in this town.

01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:21.900
Wait for everybody to take a nap.

01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:23.620
Well, don't start, like, let's not

01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:27.260
get sidetracked by our critical grievances with that movie.

01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:29.860
But I'm just saying, like, their strategy was just like,

01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:31.500
we just, we don't come in together.

01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:33.380
We don't go, hey, we're the Rebel Alliance.

01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:34.940
We're here to free Han Solo.

01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:35.660
All right, right.

01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:38.540
Like, we, we, we just show up in different guises.

01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:40.060
Just disguising this part.

01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:42.100
And we, and we don't acknowledge, the only rule

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:44.900
is we just don't acknowledge that we know each other.

01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:47.620
The one rule is that we don't acknowledge

01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:48.340
that we know each other.

01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:50.500
We don't acknowledge that we know each other.

01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:56.460
Until, until, it's time, time to make shit happen.

01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:58.300
Hey, I came back.

01:56:58.300 --> 01:56:58.900
Oh, boy.

01:56:58.900 --> 01:56:59.700
Oh.

01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:00.500
Right.

01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:01.540
He was off mic.

01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.420
Hi.

01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:04.740
So we're going to go into town.

01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:07.780
Let's, let's give 10 minute waits between each of us

01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:08.540
entering town.

01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:09.380
I'll go first.

01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:09.860
OK.

01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:10.500
Good.

01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:12.820
Diarrhea, you, you go in first.

01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:14.060
I'll go first.

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:15.060
Bye.

01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:17.460
Duh, just, and just, you don't know us.

01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:18.500
Hold my hands up.

01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:19.460
You don't know us.

01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:20.180
No, blend in.

01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:23.180
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:24.580
And all you're going to do is just, you,

01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:25.500
you don't have an agenda.

01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:26.900
You're, you're not on any kind of case.

01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:28.700
You're just going to go to a store.

01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:30.660
Sure, you could go to the saloon.

01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:31.540
You could go to the thing.

01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:32.900
I'll go to the saloon store.

01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:36.460
Just try to ingratiate yourself with locals.

01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:37.100
All right.

01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:40.260
The sun begins to rise as you see the outer wall of dormants.

01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:42.460
I'll take a beer.

01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:44.140
That's the name of the town.

01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:46.100
The outer wall.

01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:48.820
The wall is thick and only about 10 feet high,

01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:52.340
but it's like make, it's mostly like a big pile of like lumber

01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:53.100
and dirt and stuff.

01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:54.460
It's kind of like a beaver dam.

01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:57.780
It's just kind of like a big, a big mess of a big thick wall

01:57:57.780 --> 01:57:59.740
kind of surrounding the city.

01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:03.140
It has a bit of bracing structure and kind of like a bit

01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:05.580
on top that you walk on that's more flat,

01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:08.140
but it's just kind of like a giant barricade

01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:09.740
surrounding the whole town.

01:58:09.740 --> 01:58:12.500
You're, you're in front of the gate and there's two guards.

01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:14.100
Well, they, they seem like they're guards,

01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:16.060
but they're not wearing uniforms or anything.

01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:17.940
And they're sitting on top of the gate.

01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:21.180
You look at them and you can tell they're sleeping.

01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:24.460
They're sleeping on the job in the morning.

01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:27.100
Hey.

01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:28.420
Hey.

01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:31.300
They slowly wake up as if out of a stupor

01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:33.700
and they, they're squinting in the sunlight

01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:36.260
and looking around, they, they, they spot you.

01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:38.660
Hey, can I get in?

01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:40.580
What, what's your business here?

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:43.740
I, I need to, I, there's some stuff in there I have to get.

01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:44.580
Just open the door.

01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:45.420
I gotta go.

01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:46.620
I gotta go.

01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:48.540
You don't look like you're from around here.

01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:49.380
Why should we let you in?

01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:51.420
No, no, no, no, no, just open the door.

01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:52.900
I forgot my thing.

01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:54.780
You forgot your thing?

01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:58.140
I forgot my, you know, my, what is the thing?

01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.540
I don't know what they're called.

01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:01.860
You put it around your, your shirt.

01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:03.100
You put it around your shirt.

01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:04.100
Just can you open it?

01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:05.380
I'm in a hurry here.

01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:06.220
Right, yeah.

01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:09.580
I'm sorry to wake you up next to the door handle,

01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:11.580
but can you open it up so I can get my,

01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:13.740
it's really early.

01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:15.180
Just we open up the door.

01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:16.020
Yeah, no, I get it.

01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:17.820
We sometimes you forget your thing.

01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:18.660
Thank you.

01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:19.500
Open the door.

01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:20.340
Thank you.

01:59:20.340 --> 01:59:21.180
Thank you.

01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:24.220
You can see as you walking in,

01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:26.100
they're kind of falling back asleep.

01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:28.500
What the hell?

01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:29.740
Wait, he got it?

01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:30.740
Yeah, he got it.

01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:32.740
But we don't know this.

01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:34.740
You know, we don't, we didn't observe his techniques.

01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:36.500
You didn't know, he rolled a 20.

01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:37.340
Yep.

01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:38.180
Oh yeah.

01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:39.000
A 20 what?

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:39.840
20?

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:40.680
A 20 lying.

01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:43.660
A 20 of fucking bullets.

01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:45.220
I'm going to use that.

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:46.060
All right.

01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:48.340
So my plan was like, we just go individually

01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:49.940
because it's like, we don't, we just want to,

01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:52.340
we just want to, we want to cast a wide net

01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:54.460
because I feel like our mission is infiltration.

01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:55.300
I mean,

01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:57.580
I walk up at 10 minutes later,

01:59:57.580 --> 02:00:00.180
I walk up to the guards and I go,

02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:02.100
Hey, can you guys let me in?

02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:03.500
No, they wake up.

02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:08.220
You look like you're like a knight or something.

02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:09.620
What do you got?

02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:10.460
What are you doing?

02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:15.460
I'm just a, my friend just came through here.

02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:17.900
I'm his assistant.

02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:22.020
He left his ID and I want to make sure he has the stuff.

02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:22.860
I'm not even staying,

02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:24.580
I just want to make sure he has his thing.

02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:27.260
The guards follow sleep while you're talking.

02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:28.100
All right.

02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:28.940
So I walk through.

02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:29.940
It's a closed door though.

02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:30.780
All right.

02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:31.900
How tall is the door?

02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:33.060
It's 10 feet high.

02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:34.660
It looks very easy to scale.

02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:35.740
I scale the door.

02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:36.580
All right.

02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:39.620
All right.

02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:40.460
Yeah.

02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:43.020
It's very easy to sneak past the sleeping guards.

02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:44.060
It's, it's a,

02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:45.600
it's about like nine in the morning

02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:47.180
and they're still sleeping.

02:00:47.180 --> 02:00:48.020
You don't know,

02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:49.580
they seem like they might have slept

02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:53.200
through the night shift.

02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:54.500
I walk back.

02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:59.500
I scale back over the door and just call Carlos

02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:02.300
and say like, hey, it's easy.

02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:05.660
Don't, don't, we're not supposed to,

02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:07.540
you're blowing your cover.

02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:08.380
Okay.

02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:11.180
I just, I get back inside.

02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:12.100
All right.

02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:12.940
All right.

02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:14.180
Now I, after, and then I,

02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:15.620
and then I approach the gates.

02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:16.780
The guards are sleeping.

02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:21.780
They wake up with a start and they grab their spears

02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:24.620
and they're like holding their spears.

02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:27.140
Like, get it, fuck off.

02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:27.980
What are you doing?

02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:29.780
I request entry to Dornaster

02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:31.660
on a diplomatic and religious mission

02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.740
for the church of the silver flame.

02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:35.780
The door fee is three copper.

02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:40.020
I wonder if the church approves that fee

02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:42.260
or should it go into your local fund?

02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:44.940
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:46.980
For the last I shall pay it.

02:01:46.980 --> 02:01:47.820
All right.

02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:49.060
One of the guards falls asleep

02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:51.580
and the other one, he, he holds his spear down

02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:53.180
and the spear is like holding a bucket

02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:54.740
that you can put the money into.

02:01:55.900 --> 02:02:00.460
Interesting how weapons are adapted to commerce

02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:01.880
in times of peace.

02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:05.340
The guard falls asleep

02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:07.180
and the bucket falls on the ground.

02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:08.020
Whoa.

02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:11.220
Wake up.

02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:14.900
Wait, check, see how much money's in that bucket?

02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:15.740
What is my-

02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:16.580
There's only his money.

02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:17.420
That's my money.

02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:18.540
Well, take your money back.

02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:20.060
Hello.

02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:21.100
They wake back up, huh?

02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:23.900
You, you're so accustomed to taking bribes,

02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:25.940
you fell asleep during it.

02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:26.940
That sounds right.

02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:27.780
Yes.

02:02:27.780 --> 02:02:30.980
Please let me in so I can not report you to the church.

02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:31.820
All right.

02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:33.940
Just, just go away.

02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:35.540
They open the door.

02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:37.300
I pocket my copper.

02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:38.140
All right, so.

02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:39.140
And my integrity.

02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:42.500
Hey, no, just, hey, don't.

02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:45.220
I'm hiding behind the, the, the bushes.

02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:48.100
Just the idea was for us to arrive as if we were.

02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:49.220
Don't give me away.

02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:50.700
I can't, I'm not.

02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:53.300
Pretty cool getting in here.

02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:54.140
Huh?

02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:54.980
Yeah.

02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:55.820
They were asleep.

02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:57.420
Yeah, the idea was.

02:02:57.420 --> 02:02:59.300
All right, so, so we're all inside now.

02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:00.140
Yeah.

02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:00.980
We're all inside.

02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:03.940
But, and it's 10 or three, so let's.

02:03:03.940 --> 02:03:06.100
You're clustered near the pig farm.

02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:06.940
We're clustered.

02:03:06.940 --> 02:03:09.300
And the various farms.

02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:11.380
All right, hey guys, good job getting in.

02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:13.540
Hey, I guess my plan didn't work.

02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:16.260
We just, now we're all in together and.

02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:18.100
So we're not, we're not gonna.

02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:20.020
However, we're not on record with Sleeping Guards

02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:21.220
as coming as a group.

02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:22.060
That's important.

02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:22.900
Yeah.

02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:23.740
I think.

02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:24.940
As far as, as far as they're concerned,

02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:26.500
we were three different people.

02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:29.220
I think we should still now take advantage of that fact,

02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:32.220
that as far as the record shows,

02:03:32.220 --> 02:03:35.500
a group of church officials never came to this town.

02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:36.340
You know?

02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:36.680
Right.

02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:40.940
So we can now spread out, because our first,

02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:42.780
first thing we need to do is find information.

02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:44.220
We need to find passion.

02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:46.180
We gotta, we gotta find information.

02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:48.300
We need to figure out what's going on in this town.

02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:50.020
And how a network of brigands.

02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:53.220
Why is everybody so tired?

02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:54.980
A lot of sleeping.

02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:56.620
What time, what time of day is it Spencer?

02:03:56.620 --> 02:03:58.420
It's about nine, maybe ten.

02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:01.980
Is there a town like Belle, like a church, like a tower?

02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:04.540
There is a church, but it doesn't have a bell.

02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:05.020
All right.

02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:06.820
We got to get these people a bell.

02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:10.020
I'm going to say, you know, like,

02:04:10.020 --> 02:04:15.020
from this conversation forward, unless Peril demands it,

02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:18.180
we don't acknowledge that we are part of the same.

02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:22.260
In search of a bell.

02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:25.180
And we also, I'll be an emissary of the church,

02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:28.020
but you guys have to make up your own backstories.

02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:28.740
OK.

02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:33.860
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm a, I'm a down at heel gambler.

02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:34.860
Downing?

02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:40.460
Yeah, who's, who's ready for action?

02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:42.820
I just like to see you happy.

02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:44.020
And Diarrhea?

02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:49.460
I'm going to, I'm a, I'm a, I work with the church.

02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:50.940
Oh.

02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:51.940
You had one job.

02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:52.420
Clifinger!

02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:58.180
Wait, wait, the wrong song.

02:04:58.180 --> 02:04:59.860
All right.

02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:00.900
We'll pick up our.

02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:08.380
Yeah, let's hear it for Spencer Crittenden and Rob Schrab.

02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:13.020
Josh Androwski, wait, what's his website's name?

02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:15.540
I have it in my text.

02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:17.460
It's got to be dsa.sum.

02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:20.420
It's called Left Coast, right?

02:05:20.420 --> 02:05:21.540
God damn it.

02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:22.500
We had one job.

02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:26.860
It's a podcast with Jeff Androwski called Left Coast.

02:05:26.860 --> 02:05:28.260
Spencer Crittenden and your game master.

02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:30.580
I'm Jeff Davis, your comptroller.

02:05:30.580 --> 02:05:33.460
I'm way too tired to name everybody here.

02:05:33.460 --> 02:05:35.460
But let's hear it for Church.

02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:37.740
Church, our guest.

02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:40.100
Kris Boruff, Sarah Hill.

02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:41.500
Who else is out there?

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:46.340
Zac McKeever, other people.

02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:49.380
Nolan Fabricius.

02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:51.460
Oh, Church is doing a dance with Rob Schrab?

02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:52.660
Boop, boop, boop.

02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:54.660
My name is a podcast man.

02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:56.820
I just distributed my podcast.

02:05:56.820 --> 02:05:59.300
I did it without the FCC's permission.

02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:03.500
But you allowed for a government takeover of the internet.

02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:05.020
So this might be over.

02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:07.940
In the future, you won't be able to get to this site

02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:14.420
because let's hear it for your mayor, Dan Harmon, number one.

02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:18.260
Let's hear it for Rob Schrab and the Zardaz chair.

02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:22.220
Davros, I meant Davros.

02:06:22.220 --> 02:06:24.340
Or Zardaz.

02:06:24.340 --> 02:06:27.180
Rob, what if Zardaz became Davros?

02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:29.500
How would that go?

02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:33.060
Ha, ha, ha.

02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:37.180
And your church is with a merchist.

02:06:37.180 --> 02:06:38.740
I can sound a church.

02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:42.140
Takes those photos that you like so much.

02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:44.420
Dan, you want to do a little rap?

02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:49.860
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:52.820
Ending rap, end of the show.

02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:55.660
Go out and grow, tree to tree, limb to limb.

02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:58.020
Put your roots in the ground and look at me.

02:06:58.020 --> 02:07:00.340
I'm a blue sky and I'm your father.

02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:01.300
Don't look at your mother.

02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:02.060
Don't bother.

02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:04.060
She's an impersonal cosmic force.

02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:10.740
And I fucked her, of course, but not in a disrespectful way.

02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:14.420
I was honored.

02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:24.260
Hey, Spencer, let's get together to do the dance right.

02:07:24.260 --> 02:07:26.900
Next week, Balderdash will play around at Balderdash.

02:07:54.260 --> 02:08:07.260
Did you get any of that?

02:08:07.260 --> 02:08:10.260
It's a good show.

02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:22.260
Feral Audio.
