00:00.000 --> 00:16.440
Here you, here you, Harmontown is in session.

00:16.440 --> 00:20.080
Welcome everybody to the NerdMill Theater in Hollywood, California.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.080
How are you tonight?

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
Fantastic.

00:22.080 --> 00:29.080
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:29.080 --> 00:46.600
He's doing a little dance, little side to side, his feet are going side to side, his

00:46.600 --> 00:47.600
hands are on his hips.

00:47.600 --> 00:54.080
Oh yeah, sorry, it's a podcast, sorry, sorry about that podcast listeners.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.080
You can't just dance on a podcast.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.600
Oh, you can, and you should.

00:58.600 --> 01:03.760
That's like the, when people who are big fans of LPs, that was the cracks, pops, and whistles

01:03.760 --> 01:08.040
of listening to old school audio recordings metaphorically.

01:08.040 --> 01:12.320
You don't see the little kicky dance when you listen to a Harmontown podcast, you have

01:12.320 --> 01:13.920
to come here to NerdMill.

01:13.920 --> 01:18.760
Your dances, historically speaking, are very kicky based, there's lots of little toe kicks

01:18.760 --> 01:19.760
to the side.

01:19.760 --> 01:26.600
I'm a little baby, and I'm getting prouder of it as I get older, which is good in a

01:26.600 --> 01:32.560
Kubrickian sense, because as we know, we do become babies as we get older.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.920
In my 30s, in my early 30s, there was a shame of the fact that I was a baby, because you'd

01:37.920 --> 01:43.080
go out with women, sooner or later they find out you're a baby, and they actually say the

01:43.080 --> 01:52.800
words, you're a baby, or you say them, I'm a baby, and I found a girlfriend who is okay

01:52.800 --> 01:55.600
with me being a baby.

01:55.600 --> 02:03.400
I specifically enjoy being what she calls a little cloud baby.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.640
Would you explain?

02:05.640 --> 02:11.240
I'd be happy to, because we're in a good mood tonight.

02:11.240 --> 02:16.760
I have a big down comforter in my room, and it's white, and I like to crawl under it and

02:16.760 --> 02:20.920
hold it up to my chin, and make a little baby face.

02:20.920 --> 02:30.800
Aaron makes a sound that is exactly half horror, half orgasm.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.800
Horror?

02:31.800 --> 02:32.800
Horror?

02:32.800 --> 02:33.800
Yeah.

02:33.800 --> 02:40.200
Well, because she's going out with a baby, and she wants a baby, but she doesn't want

02:40.200 --> 02:42.200
to have to fuck it.

02:42.200 --> 02:50.280
No, but it's making her dignity and her ovaries fight each other and explode.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.600
It's like a twilight zone, be careful what you wish for.

02:53.600 --> 02:59.600
Yeah, I can't imitate it, but I can make a little baby face in bed that will make Aaron

02:59.600 --> 03:02.600
go, yeah!

03:02.600 --> 03:10.560
Well, I'm in a good mood because I got a call from my doctor today, and I got really, really,

03:10.560 --> 03:14.760
really bad news from him.

03:14.760 --> 03:15.760
Congratulations.

03:15.760 --> 03:23.760
I had lab work done, like they suck the plasma out of your body, and then they send it off

03:23.760 --> 03:27.440
to a lab, and you fill out a clipboard.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.440
What do you want checked?

03:28.440 --> 03:29.440
I want everything checked.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.560
I want to know if I've ever come close to herpes.

03:32.560 --> 03:39.120
I want to know if I've eaten waffles, I want to know what my liver's doing, I want to know

03:39.120 --> 03:40.120
my kidneys, everything.

03:40.120 --> 03:44.400
Okay, this is a little over going to take a while, okay, fine, just give it to me.

03:44.400 --> 03:49.240
This is time, I'm 39, and it's been a month that they called me today.

03:49.240 --> 03:55.480
There was a mix-up with the phone number and they finally called me, and it's dark news

03:55.480 --> 03:59.000
because I'm in perfect condition, and the reason it's dark is because now I'm going

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
to kill myself, like because I feel like he-man.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.360
I've done nothing but abuse my body.

04:07.360 --> 04:11.920
My doctor called me today and said, your cholesterol is well within allowances.

04:11.920 --> 04:18.120
You know, we're a fat country, so I prefer to look at ideals.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.760
You're one point away from the ideal.

04:19.760 --> 04:24.120
I think if you do a little bit of exercise, you can knock it down to the ideal.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.120
Ideal?

04:25.120 --> 04:31.760
I'm going to go to the Olympics with my cholesterol.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.520
My liver's fine?

04:33.520 --> 04:36.120
Are you kidding me?

04:36.120 --> 04:37.120
That is a lie.

04:37.120 --> 04:41.120
Are you sure he's a doctor?

04:41.120 --> 04:42.960
That might not be a doctor.

04:42.960 --> 04:49.720
It may be an elaborate Kettle One-sponsor-con job.

04:49.720 --> 04:54.440
I walk out of the place, and the whole facade of the Beverly Hills hospital falls down,

04:54.440 --> 04:56.760
and it becomes a Kettle One factory.

04:56.760 --> 05:01.200
It becomes a truck and drives off.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.000
Well, it worked.

05:03.000 --> 05:12.440
I'm going to do a little bit of exercise from now on, and knock that, what's the LDL on

05:12.440 --> 05:13.440
the HDL?

05:13.440 --> 05:14.440
It doesn't matter.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.440
Who cares?

05:15.440 --> 05:16.840
But here's what I care about.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.000
I'm in perfect shape, Jeff.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.520
I'm a perfect specimen.

05:20.520 --> 05:25.680
Let's have a- I'm a super baby, a super cloud baby.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.240
There's nothing wrong with me.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.240
I have my blood sugar is low.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.080
I can't get diabetes.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.480
I could eat a million Twinkies.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.480
I can't get diabetes.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.480
It's impossible.

05:34.480 --> 05:35.480
That's not true.

05:35.480 --> 05:36.480
No.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.480
You can get diabetes at some point.

05:37.480 --> 05:38.480
If we live long enough, we'll all get diabetes.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.480
You're not a doctor.

05:39.480 --> 05:42.560
It's an age- it's an age-onset disease.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.880
If you live to be a hundred, you're going to get diabetes.

05:44.880 --> 05:48.000
If I live to be a hundred, they're going to have laser spiders that go in your veins and

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
cure your diabetes.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.200
Dan, we're 200 years away from laser spider technology.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.960
We're 100 years away from laser spider technology.

05:56.960 --> 06:00.800
You're talking like you know that all of a sudden you know a lot about sci-fi.

06:00.800 --> 06:01.800
Oh.

06:01.800 --> 06:02.800
No.

06:02.800 --> 06:03.800
Thank you for the segue, Jeff.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.800
I went to the Chicago US.

06:05.800 --> 06:12.640
Also, not only can you not see our Kiki dance, you couldn't see my smug satisfaction about

06:12.640 --> 06:13.640
that segue.

06:13.640 --> 06:20.200
I feel like- part of my instinct is because last week what we did is we had, and even

06:20.200 --> 06:24.360
people who- unless you were here last week in person because we haven't podcasted that

06:24.360 --> 06:29.320
episode yet, you don't know, we brought Spencer up when we embarked on our first D&D campaign

06:29.320 --> 06:33.000
with Spencer.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.880
And I'll probably let him recap it, but we-

06:37.880 --> 06:43.560
I fucking hope so because I remember- we talked about mirrors for a long time.

06:43.560 --> 06:47.920
We were pretty drunk, but we met on a road and we killed some goblins.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.480
We went into a cave.

06:50.480 --> 06:51.480
Lots of mirrors and lots of-

06:51.480 --> 06:57.680
And then there was a lot of like- it was like a puzzle game for baby boomers, like missed

06:57.680 --> 07:03.880
with a Y, like- it's like you rotate the mirror and then there was like a statue that

07:03.880 --> 07:06.600
was red and then there was a shield that was red and-

07:06.600 --> 07:07.600
Spencer-

07:07.600 --> 07:09.600
We were so drunk and-

07:09.600 --> 07:13.760
Spencer, who is our dungeon master, for those of us who are- or those of you who are not

07:13.760 --> 07:21.160
following the saga of our D&D campaign, he walked up to me outside- when people are waiting

07:21.160 --> 07:27.560
in line here at Meltdown Comics and comes up and he goes, he opened up his book and

07:27.560 --> 07:32.640
goes, oh shit, I thought I forgot your characters, but I have them, but I forgot my die, I forgot

07:32.640 --> 07:34.760
my 20-sided die.

07:34.760 --> 07:41.000
And so we went to the front desk here at the comic book store and they were out of them.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.840
And so yeah, so he's going to be rolling dice for us on his iPod application tonight.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.200
Oh, really?

07:47.200 --> 07:49.720
Because nobody here has a die.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.720
20-sided?

07:50.720 --> 07:51.720
No.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.720
Jesus.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
Okay, really.

07:53.720 --> 07:59.240
Well, I think it's shame that's keeping you from admitting that you do.

07:59.240 --> 08:03.960
If I aim for ignorance, I think some of you are wearing your shirt from prom night and

08:03.960 --> 08:06.760
you forgot you have a 20-sided in your pocket.

08:06.760 --> 08:11.920
Does anybody have a 20-sided die on them right now?

08:11.920 --> 08:14.640
Always always keep it on you.

08:14.640 --> 08:15.880
You would have been a hero tonight.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.120
Well, we'll resume our thing with Spencer.

08:18.120 --> 08:23.240
Well, that's what I was struggling with, was do we want to warm up for Spencer or do we

08:23.240 --> 08:27.440
want to get him in early so that we're not so drunk that when we get hit with a mirror

08:27.440 --> 08:31.840
puzzle, like, you know, that was the problem.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.840
You're the mayor, baby.

08:32.840 --> 08:33.840
All right.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.480
Well, I want to hear a little bit.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.280
Before we bring Spencer up, I want to hear a little bit about your trip because I haven't

08:40.280 --> 08:46.080
seen you for four days and I went to San Francisco and Chicago since the last time we talked

08:46.080 --> 08:47.080
about anything.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.120
San Francisco, I thought there was an interesting thing.

08:49.120 --> 08:54.480
I don't know if, you know, podcast listeners, some of you maybe are in San Francisco.

08:54.480 --> 08:58.360
There's a guy on the outside the ferry building.

08:58.360 --> 09:03.600
He's a very old, like, very Morgan Freeman-y black gentleman.

09:03.600 --> 09:10.920
He's wearing an old kind of like suit, like, it's his only suit, kind of, you could sense

09:10.920 --> 09:11.920
that.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.360
He gets up in the morning and puts on his one suit.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.320
He gives you a very Morgan Freeman vibe.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.240
What do you mean specifically by a Morgan?

09:18.240 --> 09:26.960
Well, you want him to tell you how to golf or play the clarinet or use the force or be

09:26.960 --> 09:29.680
a librarian or love a woman.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.760
You want him to, like...

09:31.760 --> 09:33.640
You want a mystical black friend.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.640
Yeah.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.440
He zoos that air.

09:36.440 --> 09:41.520
He's ancient and he's got a big smile on his face and he's holding a clarinet and he's

09:41.520 --> 09:48.200
got the clarinet case with a recyclable bag in it for tips and he's got a hat on.

09:48.200 --> 09:52.280
And when I walked up to, Aaron was going to the bathroom, the bathroom line was so long

09:52.280 --> 09:54.800
that I got to kind of study this guy for a while.

09:54.800 --> 10:00.440
So if you walk past him, all you see is, oh, it's a master of clarinet sitting on the,

10:00.440 --> 10:05.200
literally on the dock of the bay, hanging out.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.200
Watching the tide.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.200
Roll away.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.840
And my God, I wish I was a better person.

10:09.840 --> 10:16.440
I wish I had more appreciation for whatever jazzy arts he could impart to me.

10:16.440 --> 10:22.200
I was waiting for Aaron so long that I kind of stood behind him and watched what was really

10:22.200 --> 10:23.200
happening.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.200
He's really just...

10:24.200 --> 10:31.360
He knows as much clarinet as I do, because he kept doing this thing, it was like an SNL

10:31.360 --> 10:32.360
sketch.

10:32.360 --> 10:39.240
He was continually re-reading his clarinet while he was talking to people.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.520
He would shout out to people and then they'd stop and talk to him.

10:42.520 --> 10:47.000
And then he was just continually in preparation to play the clarinet.

10:47.000 --> 10:54.200
When I walked up to him, when I arrived at him, it was at the end of an encounter that

10:54.200 --> 10:59.560
he was having for seemingly hours with this old white couple that were like, oh, no, no,

10:59.560 --> 11:00.560
we got to go.

11:00.560 --> 11:04.080
I'm sorry, we never got to hear you play, but here's the first five dollars.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.000
And he's like, oh, I'll take care of her, oh, I wouldn't want to have her.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.280
And then this other weird encounter happened where a guy walked by, it's like an 80-year-old

11:12.280 --> 11:17.680
guy with a 50-year-old woman.

11:17.680 --> 11:22.920
And the clarinet guy said, oh, what's going on?

11:22.920 --> 11:25.040
He would just shout stuff out at random people.

11:25.040 --> 11:30.280
He'd shout at several things out at me, but I'm a generation X, so I'd just go, huh,

11:30.280 --> 11:33.000
and look at a bird.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.080
But old white people would stop and go, well, you know, just the weather and the knees and

11:39.080 --> 11:44.600
the kneecaps, ah, like they would have this old person language with like, ah, Truman

11:44.600 --> 11:51.720
never got to eat, and they would engage each other, it was ants, you know, like a specific

11:51.720 --> 11:54.680
species would get into it.

11:54.680 --> 12:00.640
And so that happened, he snagged another old guy, it was like this 50-year-old white

12:00.640 --> 12:08.400
woman and the old white guy, and the old white guy said, well, this is my daughter, and he

12:08.400 --> 12:13.320
said, oh, I thought that was your wife.

12:13.320 --> 12:18.080
And then the old guy said, oh, you wish me to have a heart attack?

12:18.080 --> 12:22.720
Well, a woman this age, you know, that's a good way to wish you made me to get a heart

12:22.720 --> 12:28.480
attack, you know, fucking my daughter.

12:28.480 --> 12:33.320
That's 22% of deaths over the age of 75.

12:33.320 --> 12:40.120
And then he kept walking away, and then the clarinet guy, he waited, it was like a block

12:40.120 --> 12:43.960
away the guy, no way he was going to hear him, but he kind of like, the gears ground

12:43.960 --> 12:48.640
and he kind of heard him, and then he thought of something to say to it, I wish sometimes

12:48.640 --> 12:57.120
she was your wife, though, and then he finally, finally, played string of pearls.

12:57.120 --> 13:00.720
So the 30 minutes that it took Aaron to go to the bathroom of this place, because the

13:00.720 --> 13:05.040
line was so long, I finally saw this guy finally put this thing to his lips, because I think

13:05.040 --> 13:11.000
part of the thing is, you know, he needs to at some point create a seam of like illusion

13:11.000 --> 13:15.860
that like he just finished or just started playing clarinet, always just finished, always

13:15.860 --> 13:18.360
just finished.

13:18.360 --> 13:22.680
I was in his blind side, you know, like I was standing behind him, like flanking him

13:22.680 --> 13:26.640
and just watching him, and so he put the clarinet to his lips, and I was like, okay, here we

13:26.640 --> 13:27.640
go.

13:27.640 --> 13:56.960
I blow my mind, or confirm what I suspect, and he went,

13:56.960 --> 14:08.000
yeah, like, that's, that's already shot, scales, I think he was doing, but worse, because

14:08.000 --> 14:13.680
he hadn't seen sound of music, and then put his prop back down, and then just started

14:13.680 --> 14:18.440
shouting out everybody up here, I don't know if that's, you know, interesting to anybody,

14:18.440 --> 14:24.280
but I thought it was very interesting, the clarinet is a very difficult instrument, there's

14:24.280 --> 14:29.400
a guy, there's a guy that lives on my street, I don't know if he lives on my street, there's

14:29.400 --> 14:36.960
a mystery person, I went away on a trip to France last year, and for three months before

14:36.960 --> 14:47.360
I left town, I would hear, and it was like, start quiet and get louder and louder and

14:47.360 --> 14:51.480
louder, and there was a clarinetist that had just taken up like fucking residence on my

14:51.480 --> 14:57.000
street, and he would wander around, and I never saw him, and I went out of town, apparently

14:57.000 --> 15:02.080
he had taken up residence on my lawn, and actually, somebody, a neighbor called the police and

15:02.080 --> 15:08.640
took him to jail, the guy went to jail, and I wanted to kill the guy, because it was like,

15:08.640 --> 15:13.640
the clarinet is not an easy instrument to play, it was terrible, and so he went to jail

15:13.640 --> 15:17.480
for a while apparently, now he's re-emerged, and I don't know the name of the instrument,

15:17.480 --> 15:26.480
but it's the one that you charm a snake with, in the middle of the fucking morning or afternoon,

15:26.480 --> 15:32.520
there's a guy at the cobra phone, the cobra phone, and I finally saw him, he's an old

15:32.520 --> 15:40.040
wisdom grade bearded guy with a giant clarinet thing with ribbons hanging off of it, it's

15:40.040 --> 15:41.040
the worst.

15:41.040 --> 15:46.680
Do you remember the guy, were you living in Los Feliz when that guy, he was a living,

15:46.680 --> 15:58.680
he was the forest gump of 9-11, the Persian guy, one day before 9-11, not Iranian, Persian.

15:58.680 --> 16:04.680
Every day before leading up to 9-11, because I lived in Los Feliz from 90, whatever, 2001,

16:04.680 --> 16:09.000
like just every single day at the same time of day, there would be this guy, you would

16:09.000 --> 16:16.280
hear him at any place in Los Feliz, he wasn't homeless, but he was clearly mentally ill,

16:16.280 --> 16:19.880
I think he had a support system, and then his support system would say, yes, you can

16:19.880 --> 16:28.520
take a walk, Kyle, and then on his walk, it was just an hour a day, I don't want to be

16:28.520 --> 16:32.440
like Larry the Cable Guy and give him a name that I'm going to regret, but I don't want

16:32.440 --> 16:43.240
to riff a name, but I want to assume his name's Kyle, his name was Xerxes, every day at the

16:43.240 --> 16:47.280
same time, you would just hear this like in the distance, because I would be riding with

16:47.280 --> 16:57.120
Schrab in my living room, and then you'd just hear from way in the distance here, and there'd

16:57.120 --> 17:01.560
be like a Doppler effect, because he'd walk past your place like an ice cream man, and

17:01.560 --> 17:06.560
it was before 9-11, and it didn't really matter, it was just like, oh, that's a different kind

17:06.560 --> 17:11.480
of crazy guy, it's better than saying I want to strangle your children, I can't understand

17:11.480 --> 17:15.560
it, it's kind of delicious, I like it, it's like an orange pop-up instead of the traditional

17:15.560 --> 17:23.480
vanilla bean, and then fucking, it was so clear, like 9-11 happened, and because I was

17:23.480 --> 17:28.600
living in the same place, and you just like never ever, that guy vanished, and he was like,

17:28.600 --> 17:32.880
he did like some white van came and just sucked him up with a vacuum cleaner.

17:32.880 --> 17:39.560
No, I think his family said, Kyle, no more walks, they're watching the news, as much

17:39.560 --> 17:43.000
as we'd like you to get out of the house once in a while, we don't want you to get killed.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah, they were watching the news of 7-11s with American flags draped in the front windows

17:49.000 --> 17:54.960
because everyone was terrified of everybody, it was a horrible time, a lot of you were

17:54.960 --> 18:02.560
six, and don't remember how horrifying it was, I remember the moments after 9-11, driving

18:02.560 --> 18:08.000
with Jeff, my comptroller down Franklin Avenue, over where birds and UCB is there now, it

18:08.000 --> 18:14.800
wasn't there then, and I remember just driving at night, and you couldn't drive, it was exactly

18:14.800 --> 18:21.120
like after a hockey game, where someone won or lost that wasn't significant to the same

18:21.120 --> 18:28.320
demographic, like the traffic blockers, because 9-11 happened and there was just, the traffic

18:28.320 --> 18:32.080
was slow everywhere, you're like, why is traffic slow, is there a 9-11 happening here too?

18:32.080 --> 18:38.680
No, it's just a bunch of 9-11 fans out in the street, and they're lining the street with

18:38.680 --> 18:44.640
some of them with candles, okay fine, that's sentimental, that's nice, but I remember seeing

18:44.640 --> 18:51.560
a bunch of dudes with baseball caps on backwards with a bed sheet that said USA on it, a bed

18:51.560 --> 18:56.400
sheet that they just grabbed, I was like, wait Steve, grab the bed sheet, and write the name

18:56.400 --> 19:03.680
of our country on it, it's crucial that we do it now, we're about to lose everything,

19:03.680 --> 19:11.800
the towers have gone down, our beds are next, let them know on Franklin Avenue what country

19:11.800 --> 19:18.840
this is, and they were chanting or driving, the cars were like, it was bumper-to-bumper

19:18.840 --> 19:25.640
traffic, gridlock, and it was just people going, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, and Jeff

19:25.640 --> 19:32.840
and I were coiling down in our seats, we're actors and writers, we're dead, the next ten

19:32.840 --> 19:43.040
years is not going to be fun, but then we elected a black man, so what did I know?

19:43.040 --> 19:50.200
That was several years later, society's never finished when you think it is, we're progressive,

19:50.200 --> 19:56.360
it seemed that night that we were dead, do you have any, what do you think, Obama, Romney,

19:56.360 --> 19:59.360
who do you like?

19:59.360 --> 20:09.560
Boy, that Romney, he's got pluck, I spent five minutes, I thought that was a bit, I thought

20:09.560 --> 20:14.440
it was a bit that he was actually the finalist, that he was the new McCain, I thought there

20:14.440 --> 20:21.440
was an actual onion bit or something, he says nothing, it's insane, he's like a parody

20:21.440 --> 20:28.120
of a parody of something that's already a parody, I'm not even, I characterize myself

20:28.120 --> 20:33.280
as being left of what most people would call liberal because I really don't like the idea

20:33.280 --> 20:39.640
that we all accept that government is necessary, it's a bummer and I know it is to keep everything

20:39.640 --> 20:47.480
in place now, but I think that it should be our goal to go, what, can't everybody stop

20:47.480 --> 20:51.720
telling people what to do, I just don't like this class of people running against each

20:51.720 --> 20:55.680
other in these popularity contests and they've never done anything in their life, they've

20:55.680 --> 20:59.360
never lifted a box, they've never washed a dish, they've never written anything, they've

20:59.360 --> 21:07.320
never directed anything, I skewed charge my current audience in the last couple, they

21:07.320 --> 21:12.520
were never nominated for a Hugo award, they don't know how to blow glass, they don't know

21:12.520 --> 21:17.760
how to take care of children, they don't know how to eat their own food, I doubt, I bet

21:17.760 --> 21:22.680
there's a guy that squeezes like a fireplace thing into their mouth with pudding in it

21:22.680 --> 21:29.400
or something, or like Robocop paste, that's designed to keep them more political, they're

21:29.400 --> 21:36.840
not real people, they don't do anything, it's democracy, so the idea is supposed to be,

21:36.840 --> 21:43.000
the ideal is supposed to be that we would all be farming and then we would go, hey Steve,

21:43.000 --> 21:48.480
you gotta be a councilman and Steve would go, fuck you, I got farming to do, sorry Steve,

21:48.480 --> 21:54.920
you're a very charismatic farmer, we need you to go to the big city and make sure that

21:54.920 --> 21:59.640
they understand how hard it is to farm out here, all right, but fuck you guys, two years

21:59.640 --> 22:06.440
and I'm out, exactly, it's written into the rules, and that's supposed to trickle up that

22:06.440 --> 22:11.120
mentality, like the guy that's president should be like to everyone in America, fuck you,

22:11.120 --> 22:16.520
for making me do this, but I will spend, because I'm an American, I will spend the next four

22:16.520 --> 22:20.560
years trying to make it as easy on you as possible, I'll try to keep these trains running

22:20.560 --> 22:26.320
on time, and it just, but you know, our predilection for hero worship and royalty fucking took over,

22:26.320 --> 22:33.120
and then who seeps in, these disgusting gross Oxford shirted fucking, they just gross schmooze,

22:33.120 --> 22:38.440
these people, they're proto human, they don't, none of them, and I'm sorry, but I include

22:38.440 --> 22:44.360
all your favorite people, and I think that, I do, and the fact that I'm afraid to say

22:44.360 --> 22:51.520
the words, I include Obama for fear that I'll get, like politics turns us all into fascists,

22:51.520 --> 22:56.200
you start to get afraid to say the wrong thing around your friends, and they capitalize

22:56.200 --> 23:01.080
on that, instead of going the other way, which is to say, look, we all have a wolf in us,

23:01.080 --> 23:05.520
we all want to chew each other's throats out, but we're also all monkeys, like we all just

23:05.520 --> 23:11.600
want to fucking eat berries, so like let's try to spiritually realign ourselves, let's

23:11.600 --> 23:17.200
find the sweet spot, yeah, right in the middle, like, that's what humans are, we're the monkeys

23:17.200 --> 23:23.360
that survived wolves by turning, by adopting their practices a little bit, but we gotta,

23:23.360 --> 23:29.920
you know, that's just such a bummer, every four years it gets more and more, I get more

23:29.920 --> 23:34.000
and more crotchety, and I don't know what to do about it, young people get so excited

23:34.000 --> 23:39.040
and you don't want to piss on that, because, like, of course Obama's a better president

23:39.040 --> 23:44.160
than some fucking clone from a Republican vat in a basement, like, of the Pentagon,

23:44.160 --> 23:52.760
like, of obviously, but that's like saying, like, diet Pepsi's better than piss, like,

23:52.760 --> 24:00.120
neither of its water, like, water is what you need, you're dying of thirst, like, we

24:00.120 --> 24:06.560
need to sustain ourselves, we're human beings, and I feel the same way about religious debate,

24:06.560 --> 24:11.320
you know, when people go, oh, are you an atheist, or are you one of these snake handler types,

24:11.320 --> 24:15.800
you know, I got like, like, oh, yeah, I have to choose between those two, you guys are

24:15.800 --> 24:22.120
all on the same side, when you kneel before a fundamentalist god and like, quiver and

24:22.120 --> 24:28.600
go like, oh, the Bible's a newspaper, here's what happened last Wednesday in 3,000 BC,

24:28.600 --> 24:32.200
and also when you're getting out your slide rule and going like, well, I don't know until

24:32.200 --> 24:39.480
I prove it, you all agree on one thing, you're all on the same side, because if I said one

24:39.480 --> 24:45.840
thing, I could make you all disagree with me, if I said, Dan Harmon is god, atheists and

24:45.840 --> 24:50.600
scientists would all throw rocks at me, they would all go, you're wrong, you're wrong,

24:50.600 --> 25:01.480
you're not god, but maybe I am, why is that not allowed, that's the Ralph Nader of religion,

25:01.480 --> 25:06.320
but for each of us, you're god, you're god, you're god, you're god, like everyone's going

25:06.320 --> 25:10.560
like, step right up to the taste test, do you believe in god or not believe in god, last

25:10.560 --> 25:13.680
name first, last name second, do you believe in god or not believe in god, do you believe

25:13.680 --> 25:19.240
in god, do you choose between math and story about eating by a whale, you have to choose,

25:19.240 --> 25:23.600
you have to choose, you have to choose, no, I don't have to choose, because both of those

25:23.600 --> 25:28.040
exist and both came out of my species mind, I'm capable, I have a processor in my brain

25:28.040 --> 25:31.880
that's more powerful than anything Apple could ever generate, because it's capable of thinking

25:31.880 --> 25:38.200
two things at once, both equally, I am capable of creation, I am capable of mysticism, I

25:38.200 --> 25:45.080
am capable of mythology, I'm capable of approaching my life from a logical and a mythical perspective,

25:45.080 --> 25:49.480
but incapable of both and you want to compromise me, you want me in shackles, don't make me

25:49.480 --> 25:55.680
choose between Pepsi and Coke, because you're just pushing corn syrup, that's it, and I

25:55.680 --> 25:59.760
feel that way about politics and I feel that way about religion, and god damn it, I was

25:59.760 --> 26:10.680
in a good mood when I came up here, we should bring Spencer up, Spencer get up here, Dungeon

26:10.680 --> 26:23.960
Master Spencer, how's it going, come on stay Spencer, say hello to the crowd, let me get

26:23.960 --> 26:36.800
up here, hello audience, Spencer I'm guessing you're a cat person, yeah I have a cat named

26:36.800 --> 26:45.400
Jason, I'm a cat person too, you feel like a cat to me, I asked him to come up the stage,

26:45.400 --> 26:53.280
he did so unwillingly, he's neither David Spade nor is he Roberto Bonini, he's right

26:53.280 --> 26:57.640
in the middle, he just glares at you and if you have some kibble in your hand he'll eat

26:57.640 --> 27:04.720
it, I love it, I don't know, I just wanted to say I love you, it's hard for our kind

27:04.720 --> 27:13.400
to express love to each other, the Dungeons and Dragons people, it's true yeah, do you

27:13.400 --> 27:24.200
love me, yeah I love you, I was just thinking that there should be a universal symbol of

27:24.200 --> 27:28.400
just like acknowledgement and benevolence that we could just express to one another,

27:28.400 --> 27:36.400
like if you wanted people to live for a long time but also prosper, if there was a way

27:36.400 --> 27:42.080
with maybe a hand signal, something you could do with your fingers, or maybe two fingers

27:42.080 --> 27:47.160
touch the other two fingers, just to get down to the logic of it all, you know I agree,

27:47.160 --> 27:53.520
Dan Spencer, you know what it is, it's called a hug, no it's not, no if you're just driving

27:53.520 --> 28:04.520
down the street and you see if I sit, hug, hug, hug, ah, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, it's

28:04.520 --> 28:12.040
like a Greek wedding, anyways do we derail you or are you going to say something, just

28:12.040 --> 28:18.400
yeah no, just the hand symbol is cool, yeah, I agree, I think we all agree, it's Harmontown

28:18.400 --> 28:23.840
or we should be safe too, and in Harmontown the new Yahtzee will be Dungeons and Dragons,

28:23.840 --> 28:32.080
you want to set up your stuff and, is it possible to cover the time of you having to unsheath

28:32.080 --> 28:40.080
your tomes with a recap of what happened so far, unsheath your tomes.

28:40.080 --> 28:50.200
The problem is I have a written down, unsheath your tomes, oh sorry, I don't know, no no,

28:50.200 --> 29:01.640
follow your heart, follow your heart, make your books naked to the world, unbind your

29:01.640 --> 29:14.760
pages, flip to the chapter of my heart, you did it, yeah, the television academy agrees,

29:14.760 --> 29:24.600
gave me an Emmy for Best Original Lyrics once, I don't know if I ever mentioned that, anyways

29:24.600 --> 29:32.000
we, for those of you who have never been here before, Jeff and I have embarked on a historic

29:32.000 --> 29:38.800
new podcasting experiment, which is we're playing Dungeons and Dragons on our podcast,

29:38.800 --> 29:43.120
it's probably someone else is doing it, but fuck them, it's podcast dynamite, this guy's

29:43.120 --> 29:46.440
nodding in the front row, are you doing it on your podcast, is that why you're here?

29:46.440 --> 29:52.600
No, but there's a lot of podcasts, all right, well, all right, fine, he said there's a lot

29:52.600 --> 29:58.920
of podcasts, yeah, of course there is, that makes sense, D&D and porn are probably the

29:58.920 --> 30:05.520
first things to arrive anywhere, there's a new technology, and they're the same people

30:05.520 --> 30:12.720
asking that question, can we use this to role play while taking a break from jerking off?

30:12.720 --> 30:18.320
Well, we should ask him, are there pitfalls or the things that we should do or not do?

30:18.320 --> 30:22.760
Well, that's a good idea, well, let's bring him up here, could you mic him up?

30:22.760 --> 30:28.360
You won't be humiliated, share it mic, what's your name, sir?

30:28.360 --> 30:38.320
My name's Greg, so Greg, you've seen Dungeons and Dragons played on other podcasts, yes,

30:38.320 --> 30:45.760
I've listened to it played on other podcasts, so are there, yeah, like Jeff said, are there

30:45.760 --> 30:48.880
things that we should avoid?

30:48.880 --> 30:54.960
Give us some do's and don'ts for podcasting our D&D campaign, like what's the biggest

30:54.960 --> 31:00.880
mistake you think has ever been made aside from the action itself?

31:00.880 --> 31:12.480
Also Greg, also Greg, Greg, take your shirt off, oh geez, okay, I've listened to a lot

31:12.480 --> 31:19.520
of role-playing game podcasts, they do live D&D games and other stuff, generally I stop

31:19.520 --> 31:23.040
listening to them because the people are sort of intolerable, so...

31:23.040 --> 31:29.920
How interesting, well if that was going to stop anybody, I'd be dead by now.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.840
How do we stay tolerable?

31:31.840 --> 31:37.720
Yeah, expound on that, can you, without making too many enemies?

31:37.720 --> 31:41.200
How about this, I'm going to lower your mic.

31:41.200 --> 31:45.480
What makes them intolerable?

31:45.480 --> 31:51.200
Generally it's people laughing too much at their own, when they quote Monty Python, nice.

31:51.200 --> 31:55.280
No Monty Python quote.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.760
Yeah, that sort of thing, you guys are new enough that you probably don't have any in

31:58.760 --> 32:05.880
jokes from about four campaigns ago, but that's an easy thing to fall into, is in jokes.

32:05.880 --> 32:11.040
In jokes are hard, I would suggest maybe keeping it short.

32:11.040 --> 32:13.480
That's a good rule with anything.

32:13.480 --> 32:16.600
I missed the last one, so I don't know how this went last time, but...

32:16.600 --> 32:17.600
We didn't keep it short.

32:17.600 --> 32:18.600
Yeah.

32:18.600 --> 32:26.920
We fell into your third sand trap, there was a dog leg in the first fairway, ended right

32:26.920 --> 32:27.920
there.

32:27.920 --> 32:31.840
Yeah, since I'm on the spot, that did come up in line, while I was there.

32:31.840 --> 32:37.280
There's people going, I hope they don't do three chapters of the laser lights with the

32:37.280 --> 32:38.280
statues?

32:38.280 --> 32:44.440
Yeah, I mean, having been stuck in mirror puzzle type things myself in D&D games, I would

32:44.440 --> 32:49.840
say that if I was the DM, I might lean more towards something which would allow you guys

32:49.840 --> 32:54.440
to role play and riff off each other, than having to figure something out.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.440
Right.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.440
All right.

32:56.440 --> 32:57.440
Greg.

32:57.440 --> 32:58.440
Greg, everybody.

32:58.440 --> 32:59.440
All right.

32:59.440 --> 33:00.440
Well done, Greg.

33:00.440 --> 33:01.440
Thank you very much.

33:01.440 --> 33:08.760
Well, that was a wolf in sheep's clothing, wasn't it?

33:08.760 --> 33:14.760
Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition.

33:14.760 --> 33:21.560
I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself.

33:21.560 --> 33:25.960
Spencer, catch the audience up and catch us up.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.520
Where did we leave off last time in our campaign?

33:28.520 --> 33:31.840
All right, well, I should say, I was just testing the audience.

33:31.840 --> 33:32.960
I do have dice.

33:32.960 --> 33:37.760
I'm really disappointed in all of you.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.040
He had actual dice.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.520
He pretended to lose them to see who would have dice.

33:41.520 --> 33:45.600
Oh, you were just a clever pawn in my game, Jeff.

33:45.600 --> 33:49.520
Well, that's a dungeon master.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.320
Also, that's a liar.

33:52.320 --> 33:55.400
He's a mastermind.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.400
All right.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.360
You've got, you have your 20 side?

33:58.360 --> 33:59.360
Yeah.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.360
Yeah, I got it all.

34:00.360 --> 34:01.360
You son of a bitch.

34:01.360 --> 34:03.360
Don't underestimate him.

34:03.360 --> 34:04.360
All right.

34:04.360 --> 34:07.520
Or trust him.

34:07.520 --> 34:10.440
Don't do either.

34:10.440 --> 34:15.560
These are the chronicles of Sharpie and Quark, heroes whose names are etched into the very

34:15.560 --> 34:21.280
walls of fate itself, who made destiny their bitch.

34:21.280 --> 34:26.120
Our heroes were last seen hacking goblins to pieces and rearranging mirrors deep in the

34:26.120 --> 34:27.640
bowels of the trove.

34:27.640 --> 34:31.920
You are in the dark passage of a small cave, but you can see that it opens up into a great

34:31.920 --> 34:32.920
cavern.

34:32.920 --> 34:37.520
A pit stretches out before you, but you can see a rickety old bridge bridging the gap.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.840
Oh, let's cross that bridge.

34:39.840 --> 34:43.160
Yeah, I mean, if it was going to break, it would have broken by now.

34:43.160 --> 34:44.160
Right.

34:44.160 --> 34:50.080
I should warn you, across the cavern lies an enormous white pig wallowing in a glimmering

34:50.080 --> 34:51.680
pile of treasure.

34:51.680 --> 34:54.440
Wait, he's underneath the bridge?

34:54.440 --> 34:56.840
He's across the bridge.

34:56.840 --> 35:00.280
And if we cross that bridge, there's a white pig with some treasure?

35:00.280 --> 35:01.280
Yep.

35:01.280 --> 35:03.000
A living pig?

35:03.000 --> 35:04.600
It's a gigantic pig.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.000
A white pig?

35:06.000 --> 35:07.720
A white and albino pig.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.880
You can see it.

35:09.880 --> 35:12.400
I have a plus seven against albino pigs.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.240
I'm making that up.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.920
He's making it up.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.400
All right.

35:17.400 --> 35:20.960
Well, rickety bridge worries me.

35:20.960 --> 35:21.960
Well, okay.

35:21.960 --> 35:22.960
But like I...

35:22.960 --> 35:23.960
Craig, any ideas?

35:23.960 --> 35:24.960
Yeah.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.320
Yeah, I didn't think so.

35:27.320 --> 35:31.120
It's just, yeah, it's fucking scary.

35:31.120 --> 35:34.400
Got a rickety bridge, albino pig.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.400
I want that treasure, Herman.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.760
I want that pig.

35:37.760 --> 35:42.120
I want that treasure sharpie butthole up.

35:42.120 --> 35:44.600
I call out to the pig.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.680
It doesn't seem to see you.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.480
It's interest in wallowing in treasure.

35:48.480 --> 35:54.000
I think it's an illusion, but the odd thing is, it's mocking us.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.240
I think it's saying, hey, look, you're pigs, right?

35:56.240 --> 35:57.240
You want treasure.

35:57.240 --> 36:01.280
Maybe because of my small size, can I get across that bridge without any trouble?

36:01.280 --> 36:03.240
You can definitely try to sneak across the bridge.

36:03.240 --> 36:06.000
I'm going to sneak across that bridge, Spencer.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
All right.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
I'm rolling the dice.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Uh-oh.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
All right.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.520
You managed to cross the bridge, but you hear a couple creaks.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.640
But I'm across it?

36:16.640 --> 36:17.720
You are across it.

36:17.720 --> 36:22.880
So I probably worried about that fat ass sharpie butthole out getting across it.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.320
I'm not fat, I'm just not deformed.

36:25.320 --> 36:30.600
I'm sorry, I'm a little people.

36:30.600 --> 36:35.960
Hey, sharpie, get over here, it's great.

36:35.960 --> 36:41.520
I heard creaks, fucker.

36:41.520 --> 36:44.960
Check out the pig.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.480
I check out the pig.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.920
The pig is wallowing in treasure.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.800
It stands a good 10 feet tall at the shoulder.

36:51.800 --> 36:54.680
His eyes gleam yellow like topaz jewels.

36:54.680 --> 36:55.680
Can I attack this pig?

36:55.680 --> 36:56.680
You are far off.

36:56.680 --> 36:57.880
You're about 30 feet away.

36:57.880 --> 36:58.880
You'd have to charge it.

36:58.880 --> 37:01.880
I'm going to charge a pig.

37:01.880 --> 37:06.480
I didn't come this far to not charge pigs.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.800
I'm a barbarian gnome.

37:08.800 --> 37:12.640
I come from a long line of pig chargers.

37:12.640 --> 37:15.880
Leaving sharpie across on the other side of the bridge, you draw your sword and charge

37:15.880 --> 37:17.380
towards the pig.

37:17.380 --> 37:20.440
It stands up in anticipation of your coming strike.

37:20.440 --> 37:25.360
As you see it, you notice a few gold coins fall from its mouth.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.960
You swing at the pig.

37:27.960 --> 37:29.960
It's a treasure eating pig.

37:29.960 --> 37:30.960
You miss.

37:30.960 --> 37:31.960
Uh oh.

37:31.960 --> 37:32.960
Oh shit.

37:32.960 --> 37:36.320
Your blade glances harmly off the pig's skin.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.800
You hear a sharp tink.

37:37.800 --> 37:38.800
Uh oh.

37:38.800 --> 37:43.040
I'm telling you, it's like some kind of golem or something.

37:43.040 --> 37:45.360
I got to get over there and help my little semi-friend.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.000
Just cross the bridge.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Jackass.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.880
I'm getting my ass kicked by an albino pig over here.

37:53.880 --> 37:59.600
I remember from my history that I cast Featherfall on myself to get out of that tower I was kept

37:59.600 --> 38:00.600
prison in.

38:00.600 --> 38:01.600
Uh huh.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.600
So I assume that's one of my spells.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.400
You've forgotten it.

38:05.400 --> 38:14.640
How convenient.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.200
The pig poises, ready to strike at your friend.

38:17.200 --> 38:26.200
Alright, I bound across the bridge by the way, planting my full weight on each footfall.

38:26.200 --> 38:31.040
With ease you cross the bridge, relatively few strides.

38:31.040 --> 38:34.800
You're across the bridge.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.560
Now you can like attack or cast a spell.

38:37.560 --> 38:38.560
Or do nothing.

38:38.560 --> 38:39.560
Even wait.

38:39.560 --> 38:40.560
Alright.

38:40.560 --> 38:41.560
Can I attack again?

38:41.560 --> 38:45.120
It's his turn that would be the pig's turn then yours.

38:45.120 --> 38:50.200
Does sleep work on potentially inanimate pigs?

38:50.200 --> 38:53.760
You can certainly try it.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.120
I didn't learn anything about it.

38:55.120 --> 38:59.880
In wizard school you learned that if this was in fact some sort of construct pig it

38:59.880 --> 39:02.320
wouldn't work, but if it was a living pig it probably would.

39:02.320 --> 39:03.320
Right.

39:03.320 --> 39:06.600
But living pigs are usually not ten feet tall.

39:06.600 --> 39:11.600
Construct pig.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.720
Ray of Frost.

39:13.720 --> 39:20.600
You cast Ray of Frost, a blue beam shoots towards the pig.

39:20.600 --> 39:25.480
The beam connects squarely in the face of the pig.

39:25.480 --> 39:26.480
Fuck yeah.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.480
See I'm not useless.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.480
Yeah.

39:28.480 --> 39:29.960
Took you long enough to get across that bridge.

39:29.960 --> 39:32.160
He takes two damage of cold.

39:32.160 --> 39:38.560
Let's hope it's a first level giant white pig.

39:38.560 --> 39:46.720
The pig reacting to the beam hitting it in the face rears up and brings its feet down

39:46.720 --> 39:47.720
on Jeff.

39:47.720 --> 39:48.720
I can't talk.

39:48.720 --> 39:49.720
Quark.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.720
Yeah.

39:50.720 --> 39:51.720
Quark.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.720
Am I okay?

39:52.720 --> 39:53.720
Let's see.

39:53.720 --> 39:54.720
Uh oh.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.920
What's your armor class?

39:56.920 --> 39:57.920
17.

39:57.920 --> 39:58.920
17.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.760
Give it to me straight Spencer.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.760
How am I?

40:02.760 --> 40:05.040
I got a ten foot fake pig on me.

40:05.040 --> 40:11.120
The pig foot lands on your chest but the armor manages to protect you.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.160
You are on the floor but unharmed.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.160
Sweet.

40:14.160 --> 40:19.000
All right now go so you're on the floor so you can get up probably.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
I'm gonna get up.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
I get up.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.400
You leap to your feet.

40:23.400 --> 40:29.160
I run behind my friend.

40:29.160 --> 40:33.960
High tailing it away you attempt to outrun the pig but the pig makes a swipe at your

40:33.960 --> 40:34.960
back.

40:34.960 --> 40:35.960
Oh shit.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.120
I had my chance.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.400
Much like the first blow this one manages to avoid hitting you.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.400
All right.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.400
You escape safely.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.160
I do have a giant sword don't I?

40:45.160 --> 40:46.160
Yes.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.080
I would attack that pig one more time.

40:48.080 --> 40:54.800
All right you whirl around and slash the pig in the face.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.800
You connect with the pig's face.

40:56.800 --> 41:00.600
A crack appears right across its nose.

41:00.600 --> 41:09.400
We'll be right back.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.400
Is it my turn?

41:10.400 --> 41:11.400
You can go ahead.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.400
Yes.

41:12.400 --> 41:16.000
I have to ask you a quick question as a dungeon master.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Yeah any questions.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
I have a list of spells here and then I have check marks on some of those spells.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.520
You can cast the ones with check marks right now.

41:23.520 --> 41:24.880
Later you can change them.

41:24.880 --> 41:25.880
Oops.

41:25.880 --> 41:26.880
Okay.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.880
Oh boy.

41:28.880 --> 41:29.880
Magic missile.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.560
You cast magic missile on the pig.

41:32.560 --> 41:36.880
A blinding sphere of light shoots forth from your palms and strikes the pig right in its

41:36.880 --> 41:37.880
leg.

41:37.880 --> 41:38.880
Leg.

41:38.880 --> 41:39.880
Let me get a dice.

41:39.880 --> 41:40.880
Aim for the face.

41:40.880 --> 41:41.880
A dude.

41:41.880 --> 41:49.640
I'm into the arcane arts.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.160
You hit it for four damage.

41:51.160 --> 41:52.160
See?

41:52.160 --> 41:55.480
That's like twice as much as your sword by the way.

41:55.480 --> 41:58.880
I didn't say out loud the sword did seven damage.

41:58.880 --> 41:59.880
Oh.

41:59.880 --> 42:00.880
Sorry.

42:00.880 --> 42:04.360
Twice as much as my ray of frost.

42:04.360 --> 42:08.760
I'm getting better.

42:08.760 --> 42:13.160
Your arcane magic missile strikes the pig.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.160
It is angry.

42:14.160 --> 42:17.280
It charges you Sharpie.

42:17.280 --> 42:20.160
It's barreling right towards you.

42:20.160 --> 42:23.560
Let's see if it connects.

42:23.560 --> 42:25.120
The pig plows right into you.

42:25.120 --> 42:27.320
It knocks you up in the air.

42:27.320 --> 42:30.520
When you land flat on your back, sprawled out.

42:30.520 --> 42:33.360
You can go ahead, Jeff.

42:33.360 --> 42:35.840
I want to kill this pig.

42:35.840 --> 42:43.320
How does just a regular gnome barbarian like me kill a fake construct albino pig?

42:43.320 --> 42:45.520
Can I swipe at it again?

42:45.520 --> 42:47.520
Can you fly into a berserker rage?

42:47.520 --> 42:48.520
Berserk rage.

42:48.520 --> 42:49.520
I go into a rage.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.440
You fly into a rage.

42:51.440 --> 42:55.840
As your eyes turn red, the muscles on your body bulge and ripple.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.520
Peace in size.

42:57.520 --> 43:00.040
Get a room.

43:00.040 --> 43:02.760
You lose all capacity to listen to logic and reason.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.440
You can only take violent actions.

43:04.440 --> 43:07.280
Let's do this thing.

43:07.280 --> 43:08.280
You fly at the pig.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.280
I'm going to kill a pig.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.560
Slashing it across the side with your blade.

43:11.560 --> 43:14.560
Give me 20.

43:14.560 --> 43:15.560
You got a 17.

43:15.560 --> 43:16.560
That's pretty close.

43:16.560 --> 43:17.560
Oh, that's not bad.

43:17.560 --> 43:19.800
You strike the pig on its flank.

43:19.800 --> 43:23.120
Its side splits open and several coins fall out.

43:23.120 --> 43:27.160
It's still on some of its last legs.

43:27.160 --> 43:28.160
It's a piggy bank.

43:28.160 --> 43:31.160
I just got that.

43:31.160 --> 43:35.480
I just got that.

43:35.480 --> 43:39.240
I can't hear logic right now.

43:39.240 --> 43:42.640
I say that aloud.

43:42.640 --> 43:45.920
You're talking to a crazy person right now.

43:45.920 --> 43:49.600
I'm attacking a pig.

43:49.600 --> 43:50.600
Have I...

43:50.600 --> 43:51.600
Hey, Dan.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.480
Is there a cork out of its belly?

43:53.480 --> 43:55.840
Is there a cork in its belly?

43:55.840 --> 43:57.840
I examined the pig.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.200
Good job there.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.200
You examined the pig.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.200
Good Jew.

44:01.200 --> 44:02.960
Yeah, good Jew.

44:02.960 --> 44:08.520
The enemy of the pig.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.440
Here we go.

44:11.440 --> 44:18.080
You do notice on its underbelly is a faint line indicating maybe some sort of seam.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.080
Come on.

44:19.080 --> 44:20.080
It's a piggy bank.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.080
Yeah.

44:21.080 --> 44:22.080
Right.

44:22.080 --> 44:28.560
Is there a little hammer I can get a hold of?

44:28.560 --> 44:29.560
Crack it.

44:29.560 --> 44:32.720
You can see some large lorox flying on the ground.

44:32.720 --> 44:39.680
I shout out to my non-logical, hateful friend.

44:39.680 --> 44:40.680
The belly.

44:40.680 --> 44:45.160
There's a seam on its belly.

44:45.160 --> 44:47.440
Target the belly.

44:47.440 --> 44:50.880
Your shout rings out and he barely can manage to register it.

44:50.880 --> 44:57.880
You're not sure if he understood your full meaning.

44:57.880 --> 45:01.680
Okay.

45:01.680 --> 45:04.600
I grab a rock and I attack the pig's belly with a rock.

45:04.600 --> 45:08.560
You grab a sizable boulder and smash it into the side of the pig.

45:08.560 --> 45:09.960
It shatters into pieces.

45:09.960 --> 45:10.960
Sweet.

45:10.960 --> 45:11.960
It's full of treasure.

45:11.960 --> 45:12.960
The whole pig?

45:12.960 --> 45:14.600
The whole pig is destroyed.

45:14.600 --> 45:15.600
We beat the giant piggy bank.

45:15.600 --> 45:16.600
We beat the piggy bank.

45:16.600 --> 45:26.040
The whole thing was a piggy bank?

45:26.040 --> 45:32.240
Beating the giant piggy bank was a metaphor or something?

45:32.240 --> 45:36.160
It's for your destroyed innocence as adventurers.

45:36.160 --> 45:39.600
I just made that up right this second.

45:39.600 --> 45:44.680
Let's collect this treasure and wrap this segment up.

45:44.680 --> 45:48.440
You count 3,500 gold pieces in coins.

45:48.440 --> 45:49.680
Jesus Christ.

45:49.680 --> 45:54.080
A few gems were recovered but you don't know their true values.

45:54.080 --> 45:58.760
You see a large, no, a small jade statue of a lion.

45:58.760 --> 46:00.760
It seems to be glowing softly.

46:00.760 --> 46:02.440
It looks rather heavy.

46:02.440 --> 46:05.240
As well as a box.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.880
A wooden box.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.920
Let's put that jade lion in the box.

46:10.920 --> 46:14.160
The lion does not fit in the box.

46:14.160 --> 46:16.240
He don't fit in the box.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.240
Don't be defensive.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.240
Calm down.

46:18.240 --> 46:21.360
Stop trying to do logical things.

46:21.360 --> 46:22.360
My eyes are still red.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.360
I'm sorry.

46:23.360 --> 46:25.960
You're starting to come down.

46:25.960 --> 46:26.960
Take it easy.

46:26.960 --> 46:31.560
For future reference, don't just open boxes we find in treasure piles.

46:31.560 --> 46:33.040
Or do.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.040
Open that box.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.040
Or don't.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.040
I'm going to open that box.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.040
I'm still illogical.

46:37.040 --> 46:38.040
I open the box.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.760
It's full of scrolls.

46:39.760 --> 46:42.520
You don't understand.

46:42.520 --> 46:43.520
Those are mine.

46:43.520 --> 46:48.240
That's obviously literati stuff.

46:48.240 --> 46:53.520
Using your wizard eyes you can tell that there are two scrolls of magic missile and two scrolls

46:53.520 --> 46:54.520
of burning hands.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.520
Nice.

46:55.520 --> 46:57.040
I'll take them.

46:57.040 --> 47:00.280
You also see a large gold sword.

47:00.280 --> 47:03.240
I'll be having that sword.

47:03.240 --> 47:06.360
As you reach through the sword, you notice a warmth in the grip.

47:06.360 --> 47:11.480
You hold it aloft and it emanates bright light.

47:11.480 --> 47:15.640
We're talking about jerking off, right?

47:15.640 --> 47:17.160
What's going on over there, Quirk?

47:17.160 --> 47:19.720
I'm just grabbing a warm sword handle.

47:19.720 --> 47:23.240
Why is it warm?

47:23.240 --> 47:25.360
I don't know.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.360
You tell me.

47:26.360 --> 47:29.400
Is it just warm as he grabs it or is it?

47:29.400 --> 47:30.400
It's magic.

47:30.400 --> 47:32.000
It's just generally warm.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.520
Can I investigate the sword?

47:34.520 --> 47:37.000
You investigate the sword.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.680
This blade is a bronzy gold color and it has runes that you don't understand etched into

47:41.680 --> 47:42.680
them.

47:42.680 --> 47:44.960
The handle is bound in green leather.

47:44.960 --> 47:47.000
Here's my vote.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.400
We gather all this shit up best we can.

47:50.400 --> 47:51.400
Take five.

47:51.400 --> 47:53.400
Yeah, take it back to town.

47:53.400 --> 47:57.200
We make Spencer do the grub work of adding this stuff to our inventory so that we can

47:57.200 --> 47:59.680
analyze it in another installment.

47:59.680 --> 48:01.680
Look, a full day's work.

48:01.680 --> 48:02.680
We crossed a bridge.

48:02.680 --> 48:03.680
Another day?

48:03.680 --> 48:05.680
Another 3,500 gold days.

48:05.680 --> 48:09.000
We killed the giant piggy bank.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Spencer, everybody.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Spencer!

48:11.000 --> 48:25.680
All right, Quirk, Greg, let's go to our Judges and Dragons segment, Judge Greg.

48:25.680 --> 48:26.680
Our man on the street.

48:26.680 --> 48:30.920
And see how that compared to his vast compendium.

48:30.920 --> 48:34.400
Greg, what'd you think?

48:34.400 --> 48:35.800
That was really good.

48:35.800 --> 48:37.920
I give Spencer props.

48:37.920 --> 48:39.720
It must be really hard.

48:39.720 --> 48:44.400
The whole time I was looking over him and just wondering how he could not freak out.

48:44.400 --> 48:46.400
All right.

48:46.400 --> 48:49.400
All right.

48:49.400 --> 48:52.280
It seemed like props.

48:52.280 --> 48:56.520
Then again, in my early stand-up days, when you wanted to fuck somebody over, if you were

48:56.520 --> 48:59.320
MC, you would come up after them and go, keep it going, folks.

48:59.320 --> 49:04.240
Comedy isn't easy.

49:04.240 --> 49:06.600
But I don't think that was the spirit in which that was offered.

49:06.600 --> 49:07.600
You liked it, right?

49:07.600 --> 49:08.600
No, he liked it.

49:08.600 --> 49:09.600
That was sincere.

49:09.600 --> 49:15.240
Do you have any advice for us, like things to do or not do next time?

49:15.240 --> 49:18.400
No, I can't.

49:18.400 --> 49:19.400
I got nothing.

49:19.400 --> 49:20.400
You were thrilled.

49:20.400 --> 49:21.400
I'm thrilled.

49:21.400 --> 49:22.400
You were entertained.

49:22.400 --> 49:23.400
Fantastic.

49:23.400 --> 49:24.400
We did it.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.400
It was good.

49:25.400 --> 49:26.400
We had a good, we had a good, we had a good.

49:26.400 --> 49:27.400
Anybody else out there have any questions?

49:27.400 --> 49:28.400
Yes, ma'am, right there?

49:28.400 --> 49:30.400
Examine before you fight.

49:30.400 --> 49:34.800
A young lady in the crowd says, examine before you fight.

49:34.800 --> 49:38.000
Look, I'm a barbarian gnome.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.400
If I examined before I fought, I'd be taller.

49:42.400 --> 49:43.400
All right.

49:43.400 --> 49:44.400
That's good advice.

49:44.400 --> 49:45.800
What's your name, ma'am?

49:45.800 --> 49:46.800
Jen.

49:46.800 --> 49:47.800
Jen says examine before you fight.

49:47.800 --> 49:50.800
Let's try to hear her ethereal voice next time we enter a battle.

49:50.800 --> 49:51.800
Examine.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.920
You should always examine before you fight, gentlemen.

49:53.920 --> 49:59.680
I will say in my defense, Jen, I didn't know we were in a battle until my friend charged

49:59.680 --> 50:04.720
across the bridge and attacked the pig.

50:04.720 --> 50:08.440
When I see a pig, I don't think time to fight.

50:08.440 --> 50:12.600
I think time for breakfast or a delightful Disney conversation.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.680
The last thing I thought was that we're going to be fighting it.

50:14.680 --> 50:17.960
I sent him across the bridge to test it because he's lighter.

50:17.960 --> 50:18.960
Right.

50:18.960 --> 50:19.960
I win, Jeff.

50:19.960 --> 50:20.960
All right.

50:20.960 --> 50:21.960
You blame me?

50:21.960 --> 50:22.960
Yeah.

50:22.960 --> 50:23.960
Well, I'll take it.

50:23.960 --> 50:25.960
Have you played D&D before?

50:25.960 --> 50:26.960
No.

50:26.960 --> 50:27.960
No.

50:27.960 --> 50:29.960
This is life lessons.

50:29.960 --> 50:31.960
This is life lessons.

50:31.960 --> 50:32.960
Examine before you fight.

50:32.960 --> 50:33.960
Examine?

50:33.960 --> 50:36.160
That should be written in Latin on the Harmontown flag.

50:36.160 --> 50:38.160
Examine before you fight.

50:38.160 --> 50:39.160
Pick your battles.

50:39.160 --> 50:40.160
Thank you.

50:40.160 --> 50:43.160
Thank you very much.

50:43.160 --> 50:46.920
I want to hear a little bit about your trip to Chicago.

50:46.920 --> 50:52.280
Aaron gave me a couple of little nuggets about the clientele at the Hugo Awards.

50:52.280 --> 50:54.880
Can I hear a little bit about that?

50:54.880 --> 50:56.480
It was very interesting.

50:56.480 --> 51:05.440
I'll tell you, the Hugo Awards, both at the pre-reception, explain to everybody what the

51:05.440 --> 51:06.440
Hugo Awards are.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

51:07.440 --> 51:11.120
It's the Hugo Awards are the science fiction awards.

51:11.120 --> 51:15.280
But we were nominated for one for the Community Episode Remedial Chaos Theory, which involved

51:15.280 --> 51:20.880
multiple timelines and technically qualified as science fiction, I guess, because it asks

51:20.880 --> 51:24.880
the question, what if, which is how I would define sci-fi.

51:24.880 --> 51:29.600
We were honored, and Chris McKenna, the writer of the episode, and I went with Chris's brother

51:29.600 --> 51:34.920
and my girlfriend, Aaron, to Chicago to go to the Hugo Awards ceremony.

51:34.920 --> 51:39.280
It was amazing to be back in the Midwest, and specifically to be back in the Midwest

51:39.280 --> 51:43.560
in a science fiction environment because of the body shapes.

51:43.560 --> 51:52.240
I have been the fattest guy in Los Angeles for a long time.

51:52.240 --> 52:03.480
I was like, from Krypton to Earth, like in Wreck-O, I was like, wow, I am hot, and able-bodied.

52:03.480 --> 52:09.480
Lots of rascals, lots of leg braces, lots of scooters, lots of steampunk tanks to help

52:09.480 --> 52:13.600
people breathe, goggles, tears.

52:13.600 --> 52:17.520
Those are called oxygen tanks.

52:17.520 --> 52:19.520
Just a lot of gimmicks and things.

52:19.520 --> 52:21.080
It was very cool.

52:21.080 --> 52:25.040
These are my people, after all, and all of you are here just because we moved to LA to

52:25.040 --> 52:27.360
try to force our will on the public.

52:27.360 --> 52:32.440
It doesn't mean that we are extra sexy or anything, but I like to think that the Harmon

52:32.440 --> 52:38.720
Town people are nerdy people, and so I was definitely home.

52:38.720 --> 52:45.800
But it's just very interesting, like the archetypes, like the rotund women who want

52:45.800 --> 52:50.880
to dress fancy, nothing is lost on them of the idea of, let's have a big fancy ball,

52:50.880 --> 52:58.160
but they all want to do like, well, fancy means Victorian, or like Dragon times.

52:58.160 --> 53:01.400
So everyone is kind of like wearing these costumes.

53:01.400 --> 53:06.520
Everything is as fancy as they can muster, but without buying into the bullshit, like

53:06.520 --> 53:14.080
black tie paradigm, so everyone is walking around, it's like Dr. Demento is walking around

53:14.080 --> 53:23.960
getting teacakes with women dressed like just Aphrodite, and no music, never.

53:23.960 --> 53:30.760
From the moment we got there to the moment we left, and we left soon because there was

53:30.760 --> 53:35.600
no music, and we weren't like, we're too cool for this.

53:35.600 --> 53:39.720
We got there before the awards show, we were told, show up two hours before the awards

53:39.720 --> 53:42.320
show to this reception.

53:42.320 --> 53:45.440
So you're in this like banquet hall, no music.

53:45.440 --> 53:49.840
Everybody like totally cool, they're all good people, they're all clearly like, they've

53:49.840 --> 53:56.760
all been bullied, and they're all very smart, and they've all dressed to the relative nines.

53:56.760 --> 54:05.440
As per their galactic definitions of the nines, they're dressed to the nine kelvins.

54:05.440 --> 54:09.520
So like I said, there's like octopi walking around, and that's not true.

54:09.520 --> 54:11.840
I don't want to conjure that image.

54:11.840 --> 54:15.240
You've all been to Comic-Con where there's a storm trip, or this wasn't like that.

54:15.240 --> 54:23.440
This was like an eyes wide shut kind of like back room at a real sci-fi convention, you

54:23.440 --> 54:24.440
know?

54:24.440 --> 54:30.800
Like you're not allowed to, like these are like the people that are into sci-fi books,

54:30.800 --> 54:36.840
and maybe a couple movies if they're really book based.

54:36.840 --> 54:41.520
They like the smart stuff, and I think they like fucking.

54:41.520 --> 54:46.720
It's like there's a lot of cleavage, a lot of like just taking your boobs and pouring

54:46.720 --> 54:47.720
them into things.

54:47.720 --> 54:52.240
Like Renaissance fair kind of stuff, the Renfaire, there's lots of bodices.

54:52.240 --> 54:56.480
It felt a little Renfaire-y, yeah, yeah, like in the sense that it was like, yeah, let's

54:56.480 --> 55:02.040
be fancy tonight, but let's not buy into Hugh Jackman's version of fancy.

55:02.040 --> 55:03.040
Did they embrace you?

55:03.040 --> 55:04.560
Did they recognize you or know you?

55:04.560 --> 55:10.320
I think we felt, I'm sure everyone felt this way, but we felt very nerdy, we felt outcast,

55:10.320 --> 55:11.760
we felt lonely.

55:11.760 --> 55:13.200
You were nerdy at the sci-fi?

55:13.200 --> 55:19.080
Right, because we were just guys in suits, and so we found a table, like you did in high

55:19.080 --> 55:26.120
school, and just found a quiet corner and sat, and then some people like made the effort

55:26.120 --> 55:32.960
to talk to us, and then we loosened up a little bit, but we felt very like outside and kind

55:32.960 --> 55:33.960
of off-put.

55:33.960 --> 55:37.040
And for good reason, because I went and we checked in at the convention, the woman that

55:37.040 --> 55:41.000
checked us in said, what's your name, and I said, Dan Harmon, and she said, oh, community,

55:41.000 --> 55:44.440
I love that show, love that episode, I said, oh, thank you very much, I said, you're not

55:44.440 --> 55:45.440
going to win.

55:45.440 --> 55:46.440
Oh, no.

55:46.440 --> 55:47.440
Oh, no.

55:47.440 --> 55:52.000
She said, I don't mean any disrespect, but you're up against the doctor's wife, written

55:52.000 --> 55:59.800
by Neil Gaiman, who is the David Lee Roth of science fiction, apparently.

55:59.800 --> 56:06.120
And this episode was the Panama of Neil Gaiman, thanks, that's up.

56:06.120 --> 56:10.080
And there was just no way we were going to win, and she did me the courtesy of letting

56:10.080 --> 56:14.280
me know that as I got my name tag, which I appreciate.

56:14.280 --> 56:18.800
Was there any rehearsal for your interaction with the show?

56:18.800 --> 56:20.680
Yeah, yeah.

56:20.680 --> 56:28.080
Yeah, they asked that we show up early, and I've been involved in other award shows, and

56:28.080 --> 56:29.960
this has never happened.

56:29.960 --> 56:36.520
We had to show up for an orientation in case we won, which just adds to the humiliation

56:36.520 --> 56:41.720
of losing, but also it was like a real, it was weird.

56:41.720 --> 56:51.400
We walked in, and this woman just, she was like five foot nothing, and she had designed

56:51.400 --> 56:52.400
the award.

56:52.400 --> 56:55.480
Oh boy, I don't know how to explain this.

56:55.480 --> 57:03.280
I want to impart to you guys the misery, so that you can turn it into enjoyment.

57:03.280 --> 57:06.440
But I don't know how to do it without making you miserable.

57:06.440 --> 57:11.120
You walk in, and you're in the space, and they explain to you how to walk upstairs.

57:11.120 --> 57:17.800
And I guess basically everyone there has Asperger's, every single person.

57:17.800 --> 57:20.920
That's what's normal.

57:20.920 --> 57:23.160
The attendees or the rest of the audience?

57:23.160 --> 57:28.880
Every single person, every security guard, every bartender, every woman that's going

57:28.880 --> 57:34.400
to hand you a trophy, or the woman that made the trophy, the people voting for the trophies,

57:34.400 --> 57:37.000
everyone in attendance, everyone has Asperger's.

57:37.000 --> 57:41.440
It's just Asperger, Ascon.

57:41.440 --> 57:47.400
And so I walked in, and they, because they were just like, ah, welcome, as it pertains

57:47.400 --> 57:53.400
to, the obligatory instructions will now proceed.

57:53.400 --> 57:56.600
You see the stairs are in the center of the stage.

57:56.600 --> 57:59.760
If you win, and should you win, I will not presume that you should win.

57:59.760 --> 58:03.680
However, I should, the condition that you should win, if it was your ex-organ, I suppose

58:03.680 --> 58:04.680
you might win.

58:04.680 --> 58:08.480
If you do win, please proceed in an orderly fashion, up these stairs in the middle of

58:08.480 --> 58:09.480
the stage.

58:09.480 --> 58:13.720
If you try to go up the left or right stage, you will instantly break your legs, as there

58:13.720 --> 58:18.080
are no stairs.

58:18.080 --> 58:21.480
So go up the middle, there is an X mark on the stage where you would pause with the

58:21.480 --> 58:22.480
statue.

58:22.480 --> 58:26.200
Do not hold the statue, there are glass wings on the statue, do not hold the mic handles,

58:26.200 --> 58:30.880
or it will shatter, and that would be a bad thing.

58:30.880 --> 58:31.880
Investigate stairs.

58:31.880 --> 58:35.880
I investigate the stairs, I investigate the stairs.

58:35.880 --> 58:39.440
There was a giant pig on the top of the stairs?

58:39.440 --> 58:46.000
It was just 40 minutes of people telling you what to do, should someone give you an award.

58:46.000 --> 58:58.320
And it turns out what you should do is go up the stairs, take the statue, thank everyone,

58:58.320 --> 59:00.840
and leave.

59:00.840 --> 59:01.840
That's what you should do.

59:01.840 --> 59:05.480
But it was just, they Arthur C. Clarked it, man.

59:05.480 --> 59:09.760
There was no music during the awards ceremony?

59:09.760 --> 59:10.760
Back to that.

59:10.760 --> 59:13.960
So that was the rehearsal, we had to show up for that, that was the orientation.

59:13.960 --> 59:19.080
Then we were ushered to the back of the room where the woman who invented the awards, designed

59:19.080 --> 59:23.680
them for the last three years, she's the genius that put glass wings on the back of a rocket

59:23.680 --> 59:26.800
ship that you can't hold them by.

59:26.800 --> 59:32.360
So it was another 40 minutes of her explaining, don't hold the rocket by the instinctive place

59:32.360 --> 59:37.600
where you would hold it if it was handed to you, and it acted like, instead of an apology,

59:37.600 --> 59:39.000
it was just like presumption.

59:39.000 --> 59:43.960
It was like, hey, fuck you for thinking you should hold this thing in any other way than

59:43.960 --> 59:48.960
the prescribed function, and just told you how to mail it back to yourself in a special

59:48.960 --> 59:50.600
box if you want it.

59:50.600 --> 59:54.600
You did walk out of there thinking two things, fuck, if I don't win this thing I'm going

59:54.600 --> 59:59.720
to feel like shit, and on the other hand, I just saved myself an asshole to work.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.760
She showed you how to polish it.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:06.400
She showed it, and everyone kept saying, because the statue's shaped like a rocket, don't hold

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.480
it like a dick, because it looks like a dick.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.600
No one's just saying that we're a dick, it looks like a dick.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.160
Everyone keeps making jokes about how it looks like a dick, but no one says it looks like

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160
a dick.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.720
All the women keep going, oh yeah, they're told it doesn't have to hold it like this,

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.640
or clean it like this, or hold it like this, yeah, because it looks like a dick, it looks

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.080
like a big silver dildo.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:30.080
So own it, or fucking...

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.080
Or bone it.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:38.960
Yeah, so we got the tutorial about how to clean it, this is a fucking thing that I'll

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.000
never see again in my life, and now I know how to clean it and send it off and mail it

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
to myself.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
So you didn't win.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.680
As Aaron pointed out, a simple three by three Xerox set of instructions taped to the bottom

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.120
of the statue would have sufficed, I think, if you want to get a look on the bottom.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:00.360
Oh, here's how I mail this back to LA, but we went through a lot of that stuff, then

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.880
we went to the reception.

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.080
No music, no fucking music.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.680
Was there music when people accepted the award?

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680
No.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.680
They didn't play them on?

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.320
No, I'm telling you, I'm taking you through this chapter by chapter, there's three chapters

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:21.960
to an award show, the reception, the award show itself, and then the post-afterparty.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.600
No music at either of those things at any point.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.680
Imagine an award show, first of all, imagine a reception, where everyone's just eating

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.880
tea cakes and going like, hey, what are you nominated for?

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:36.600
I don't know, no music, you're just standing in a room, and then they all go, everyone,

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.600
come in here, come into this room, and then you go into the room, and then they go, it's

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.600
time for the awards.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.600
No, it should have been.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:43.600
Silence.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.600
It should have been.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.600
It's a dead man's party.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600
Who could I...

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:55.480
It should have been, like, the greatest adventure, or the theme from Enception, or fucking anything.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.000
Like, what are nerds better at than fucking, like, soundtracks?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
You know, yeah.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.040
Like, that's what we love.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040
I guess it would...

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040
Maybe somebody complained or something.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040
You know what it was?

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.680
I guarantee you, some asked Bergey, and the person was like, the tech is not good tonight,

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:18.000
the speakers are not up to snuff, I will not play my set list with sub-par speakers.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Good news and bad news.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.200
The good news is, the sound system is optimized for verbal communication.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.880
There will be no pops and whistles.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:36.040
The bad news is, it's basically anti-optimized, or de-optimized, for anything other than it,

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.400
which happens to include tonight's selection of music, which is provided by Angela, and

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.160
I wish she was not consulted about this, and so I don't know what is happening at this

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.160
point in time, so I physically don't know what to do.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.840
All right, Stephen, well, I guess no music then.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.680
Or someone just forgot to play music, because that happens a lot.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.000
I was thinking that somebody complained the previous year, and they were like, I don't

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.520
understand why there's music playing, you know, like, some music offended them or something.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.440
Your Ben Folds 5 seems to be running contrary to my life.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.240
It just wasn't logical to play music.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:14.240
And so they just stripped it down, so this award ceremony was just a, like the trophy

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:20.000
itself, was just a silver dildo, just like a, just a finely shaped thing that could just

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
impale you.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.320
Did anybody make any silver dildo jokes, or was it?

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.520
Well, only before and after the show.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.520
Not during the show.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.440
Nobody, here's what everyone did, because everyone had been instructed as we were about

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:36.760
how to hold the trophy and how to handle it, and to not make it look like a dick when you

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.760
held it.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:43.400
So every single person who won an award accepted it from the woman who hands you the award,

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:48.600
and then looked at it like a soiled baby and handed it off to someone else.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.040
Are you happy you went, or would you rather have not, not have gone?

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.040
I'm very happy I went.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:58.840
I got, I got a 20 minutes of me being a big fucking asshole bully out of it, in my podcast.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:04.040
No, I don't know, I was happy I went, like I said, I was honored to be there.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.960
But it was, as I've said, it was my big, big, big chance to lose to Dr. Who instead of Big

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.960
Bank 30 for a change.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.160
Like, that's a, you know, that's nice, that feels good.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.200
To rate a sitcom that gets nominated for a sci-fi award, I'm doing something right slash

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.200
wrong.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.920
I wanted to be there for that.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.880
You got two TV deals with two different networks coming up.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.880
Thank you.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.920
Was it CBS and Fox, right?

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.920
Yes.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.920
Thank you.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.160
Those probably aren't going to be sci-fi shows.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.960
Do you think you could write a sci-fi show that would compete, like with the likes of

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.200
Dr. Who and things like that?

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.200
I don't know.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.200
Do you think you could do it?

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.000
I think probably, because TV, TV's big secret is like, you just have to, all you have to

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.120
do is write a good pilot, you hire a bunch of really talented people or just like, you

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:57.320
know, you just farm their sadness.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:04.400
I don't think there's anything that's impossible in TV, because no way, it's the Henry Ford

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.400
principle.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.320
Like, do you think it's possible to make a jet pack?

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.320
Yeah.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:15.800
If you put it of Korean people in a warehouse and starve them to death, yeah.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.920
If you murder enough people, you know, if you...

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.920
That's the Henry Ford theorem?

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.920
Yeah.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.920
If you chain it of human life together and make each person do one small thing, like,

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.920
yeah.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:28.920
You could do anything.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.920
You're saying you could write a sci-fi show if you put enough Korean people in a warehouse.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.920
Yes, yes.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.920
That's my promise to you tonight.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.920
On this election eve.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.920
God, I think...

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.920
Ordered by Nike.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.920
Wasn't it Archimedes who said, give me enough Korean people?

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.920
Give me enough Koreans in a warehouse.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.920
Give me 100 Koreans in one warehouse.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.920
And I can write you a...

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.920
I will give you a hit UPN show.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:57.920
If you could write...

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.920
At the top of your head, if you could write a sci-fi show, what would the premise be?

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.920
Well, I would either do it...

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.920
My first answer would be time travel in general.

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.920
I love time travel.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.920
I'd love to do a time travel show.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:10.920
Do it.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:11.920
Fuck you, lady.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:12.920
No.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:13.920
That's the...

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.920
That's the investigative before you fire me.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.920
Yeah.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:21.920
Hey, examine before you yell out, do it.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:25.920
Now, what she really meant, that was a reverse heckle.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.920
That was a high road heckle.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.920
She's like, do it.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.920
Get off stage.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.920
Go write something.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.920
That's why you...

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.920
Get us out of here.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.920
I agree with you.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.920
Time travel, I'd love to do.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.920
Why time travel particularly?

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.920
I don't know.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.920
I just think it's...

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:50.920
What's the wish fulfillment in time travel?

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.920
Because there must be, right?

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.920
Well, no, I don't...

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:55.920
I don't know.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.920
What's the fetish of time travel for you?

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.920
Well, no, because you would say...

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.920
No, I think, well, okay, yeah, yeah, empowerment.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.920
That's what it is.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.920
Because if I could be...

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.920
If I could go to any time, I would fantasize about like,

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:14.920
if my whole garage with all of the stuff that was in my Prius

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.920
got transported to 1920,

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.920
then not only I'd be like, I could be like Batman,

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.920
because I'd have a Prius.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:23.920
What do you have on that Prius?

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.920
I'd just be competing with like, machine gun Kelly.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.920
He'd have like this shitty old car.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.920
And a machine gun.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.920
He'd still kill you.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.920
I know, I know.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.920
I didn't think my fantasy through, Jeff.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.920
Because I also got like, oh, yeah, I'd have GPS.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.920
No, I wouldn't.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.920
The satellites wouldn't be there.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.920
But I just think it's a cool idea to...

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920
Your Prius, yeah.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920
It wouldn't have the right octane.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.920
You were talking about just a normal guy in 1920's Chicago.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.920
I think that would be cool.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.920
If you were like, you had to like dress up in a suit,

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.920
and you're like, hey, you know, I don't know.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.920
Yeah, wish fulfillment.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.920
That's everybody's...

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.920
Yeah, everyone has a time that they'd like to go to.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.920
We all have the fantasy of going back like,

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.920
oh fuck, what if I was like, if I knew what I knew now

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.920
and could go back to like junior high school.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.920
I'd be the coolest guy in the world.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.920
But still, I would still be bad at math.

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.920
I couldn't save anybody's life.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.920
I'd be bad at all the time in the middle of it.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.920
Also, you'd be the biggest loser in the world.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.920
Like you would be more honest with girls.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.920
They would be bigger losers.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.920
There would be a couple things that you would nail

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.920
and then everything else would fall apart

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.920
that ever went together for you.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:25.920
Well, there's your movie.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.920
Well, I think that was called Happy Gilmar.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.920
Or wait, no, what was the other one?

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:34.920
Happy Madison, Billy Gilmar, Billy Madison.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.920
I think Adam Sandler was in it.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.920
He went back to school and he went with his jean jacket

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.920
and his ACDC music.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.920
He found out that you actually wouldn't be cool in high school.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.920
Oh yeah, I never saw that.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.920
Yeah, because high school is its own culture.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.920
It's not based on any actual empirical thinking.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.920
It's based on the hormonal and like in the moment thing

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:57.920
of like a bunch of young people.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:58.920
They're right and we're wrong.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.920
So Greg, how's Dan doing right now?

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.920
As a podcast.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.920
I have the feeling you're looking for a way to end your podcast.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:13.920
Yeah, he's right.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.920
I have a better control.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.920
I would have ended the show right there,

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.920
but I'm not going to do it.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.920
Oh, all right.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:21.920
All right.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.920
Let's figure this out.

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.920
Does anybody have a question?

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.920
Anybody like to?

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.920
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.920
Raise your hand.

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.920
Okay, there.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:33.920
Shout it out.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.920
Thank you sponsorship.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.920
He's calling out for a callback to the Nike sponsorship.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.920
Yeah, well, he's talking about, what's your name back there?

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.920
Daniel.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.920
Daniel asks what happened to our Nike sponsorship thing.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.920
I think we have to figure out how to do that.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.920
We were trying to strong arm Nike into giving us money

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.920
or actually any sponsor by saying that Nike were terrible people

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.920
and then promoting Adidas.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.920
Yeah, we should probably hit that real quick.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:03.920
Everybody buy Nike because you're racist.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.920
Yes, Nike.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:15.920
The delicious shoe for the foot of the Aryan nation.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.920
You know, Dan, while you were talking about Nike

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.920
and their overt racism,

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.920
I was thinking about how comfortable I am tonight

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.920
and my Adidas.

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:30.920
It's a new shoe called the Adidas made by Puma.

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.920
It's the new Puma Adidas.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.920
We can't fucking do this, right?

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.920
We need to sponsor what we're saying.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.920
We got all tangled up.

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.920
The answer to your question, Daniel, is we fucked up.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.920
We tangled in forces.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.920
We tried to, you know, strong arm Nike,

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.920
but Nike doesn't give a shit.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.920
We tried to out Avenue Madison Avenue.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.920
Yeah, we tried to out Avenue and Avenue.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.920
It's impossible.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.920
They're already at Avenue.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.920
I don't care.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.920
I tried to stab a piggy bank earlier.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.920
We don't fucking know what we're doing.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.920
Welcome to failure.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:07.920
Any other questions?

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.920
Anybody have a question for Dan Harmon?

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:10.920
Right here, sir.

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.920
Is Kettle One your drink of choice,

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.920
or is that just for bulk drinking?

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.920
Is Kettle One your drink of choice,

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.920
or is it just for bulk drinking?

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.920
It's my drink of choice.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:23.920
Therefore, I drink it in bulk.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:24.920
Why Kettle One?

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.920
You can sense everyone's excited.

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.920
They're like, this is an ending.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:30.920
It's like that.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.920
You guys want to help.

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.920
You're like, it's a closer.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.920
I used to go bodyboarding when I was in high school,

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.920
and you would be out in the ocean,

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:41.920
and you get so tired,

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.920
and sometimes a wave would kick your ass,

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:44.920
and you'd almost drown.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:45.920
It's gonna be one good wave

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.920
to take me back into the beach.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.920
I'll get on its side.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:52.920
It doesn't have to be great.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.920
I'll still say cowabunga, no matter what.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.920
I'm gonna roll into a ball.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.920
Just get me back to the beach safely.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.920
You know, Dino's daughter got stung by a stingray.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.920
Yeah, Dino's sample toppled his daughter,

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.920
got stung by a stingray.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.920
The same animal that killed the...

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:07.920
Sea verwin.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.920
Yeah, if it stings you right,

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.920
it'll fucking kill you,

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.920
even if you're an alligator wrestler.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.920
By all accounts, it's bloody fucking painful

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.920
to get stung by a stingray.

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.920
And she's been stung by a jellyfish,

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.920
and she got her finger grounded

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.920
like a meat grinder on a field trip.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.920
And the same week that she got stung by a stingray,

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.920
our friend's daughter, who was what,

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.920
12, 13, 14, what is she?

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920
Somewhere around that, right?

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.920
Around 12 years old?

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:31.920
Come on, Dan, help me out.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.920
Wait, who are you talking about?

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:33.920
What are you talking about?

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.920
Tigger.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.920
Right.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.920
Our friend's daughter.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.920
How old is she?

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.920
Oh, 12, 13.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:39.920
Yeah, I don't know.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.920
She got...

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:41.920
Well, watch out.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.920
I can't wait to hear the recording.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.920
Who was...

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:45.920
I'm like, what...

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:46.920
What do you...

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:47.920
Yeah, she's 12, 13.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.920
The same week that she got stung by a stingray

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:50.920
and screamed bloody murder,

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.920
and it's very painful.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.920
She also dove into a pole into the flip

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.920
and scraped her face off.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.920
They all got in the car accident.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920
It's like they were, like, backing up,

01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.920
and something like that.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.920
Like, they were parked,

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.920
and somebody sideswiped them,

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.920
and they, like, her and her mom got whiplash.

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:05.920
Same week.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:06.920
She's marked for death.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.920
She's a...

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.920
Final destination.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:09.920
Final destination.

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:10.920
Final destination.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.920
Thank you, ma'am.

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.920
Final destination.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.920
That's exactly what I was thinking of,

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.920
the final destination movie,

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:15.920
which, by the way, are surprisingly good.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.920
You would never think on paper...

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.920
applause, yes, for the...

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.920
In a post, Freddie Krueger, Jason Borger,

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.920
we went too far with the,

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.920
like, who's next?

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.920
He's got forks for toes.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.920
His name's Steven.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.920
Like, we kept trying to come up with

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:32.920
an understated...

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.920
Well, Jason, Freddie, Mark, Kyle.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.920
Douglas.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:37.920
Douglas.

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.920
Douglas loves fire.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.920
He's got fire feet.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.920
Obviously, that had to give.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.920
Final destination.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.920
It's pretty...

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.920
On paper, you go, like,

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.920
oh, these kids, they go,

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.920
you know, in the beginning of each

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.920
of these movies, they go,

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:51.920
ah, we're kids.

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.920
We love having sex.

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:53.920
Let's get on the roller coaster,

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.920
and then someone goes, like,

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.920
wait, I got to tie my shoe.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.920
Don't get on the roller coaster.

01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:58.920
And then they don't get on it.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.920
And then they,

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.920
let's take pictures of each other,

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.920
like, so we can rip off

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.920
the Damien thing.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.920
And then they,

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:10.920
so then the roller coaster,

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.920
like, crashes,

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.920
big 9-11 thing happens.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.920
And...

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.920
But then one kid is looking

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:19.920
at the pictures and goes, like,

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.920
whoa, all your faces are, like,

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.920
fucked up, or there's a shadow

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.920
of a thing, like, like,

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:25.920
we were supposed to die

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:26.920
on that roller coaster.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:27.920
Now, everyone who's,

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.920
the whole movie is every kid

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:30.920
who was supposed to die

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:31.920
on the thing gets killed

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:32.920
by, like, a nail gun,

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:33.920
or their dad closes

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:35.920
the garage door in their head.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.920
Welcome to your

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.920
Grandpa Reviews movies.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.920
Don't, don't, no!

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:43.920
I want more to say,

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:44.920
don't force that ending.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:45.920
Don't die.

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:46.920
You see, he almost,

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:47.920
he almost pressed, like,

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.920
fuck you.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:49.920
I had my finger on the trigger,

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:50.920
and yet...

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.920
I think, I think you can do better,

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.920
and I think they deserve worse.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.920
Yeah.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:58.920
No.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.920
This is the final destination.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.920
We're not accepting charity,

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.920
brother.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:03.920
We're gonna be here

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:04.920
for fucking three more hours.

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:05.920
Yeah.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.920
We're gonna start breakfast here.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.920
I'm just saying,

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:08.920
those are surprisingly good movies.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:09.920
I think I've caught, like,

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.920
two and five.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:11.920
I don't know.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:12.920
I've never seen them.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:13.920
They're pretty good, man.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:14.920
Have you, have you heard about

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:15.920
Rosina's movie, Margers?

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:16.920
Has anybody seen that piece of shit?

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.920
One person backstage.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.920
Anybody out there?

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:20.920
There's two Margers out there?

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:21.920
Yeah.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:22.920
Two Margers.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.920
Margers?

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:24.920
Marters.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:25.920
Like a martyr.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.920
I thought it was about, like,

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.920
loosely...

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:28.920
No.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:29.920
Manju, there's 3.5 inches!

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:30.920
My advice,

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:31.920
my advice to you,

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:32.920
is it French, right?

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:33.920
The director is a French woman.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:34.920
My advice to you is,

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:35.920
don't see it.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.920
Do not see it.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920
Unless you like

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.920
misogynistic French directors

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.920
beating women

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:40.920
for fucking 13 years,

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:42.920
and then ending on a kind of like,

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:43.920
like, oops,

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.920
we did it!

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.920
Like, I said,

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:46.920
that's the movie.

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.920
Somebody fucking gave me that movie,

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.920
a bartender at the fucking drawing room,

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:51.920
gave me that movie,

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:52.920
like, Jeff, you like weird movies.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:53.920
Watch Marters.

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:54.920
It's crazy.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:55.920
Get to the end.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:56.920
I watched it halfway through.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:57.920
I texted her,

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:58.920
like, I hate you,

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.920
and I hate everyone you know,

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:01.920
and I hate this movie.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:02.920
And if I ever see you,

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:03.920
I'm gonna,

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.920
I'm gonna do to you

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.920
what this movie did to me,

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:06.920
and I'm going to beat you,

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:07.920
and tie you,

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:08.920
and feed you pea soup,

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:09.920
and beat you to death,

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.920
like the fucking women they do,

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:11.920
and skin you alive,

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:12.920
and then have no ending.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.920
And then I watched the ending,

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.920
I'm like,

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:15.920
okay, it's a pretty good ending,

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.920
but don't watch the movie.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.920
Don't fucking watch Marters,

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.920
or Jeff.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.920
When you watch the DVD,

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.920
they gave me the DVD

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:24.920
that you can't fucking,

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:25.920
it's not in stores,

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.920
it's not, you can't go to your fucking,

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:27.920
it's not on Netflix.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:28.920
And there's a good reason,

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:29.920
because it's fucking,

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:30.920
it's an atrocity.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.920
And I watched the movie,

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.920
and I've never seen a movie,

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.920
the DVD options are play-movie,

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:42.920
subtitles, audio options.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.920
One of them was play-movie,

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.920
play-movie with director introduction.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:49.920
I've never seen that,

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:50.920
and there's a little kind of

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920
chubby French guy,

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:52.920
who goes like,

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:53.920
he's standing by,

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.920
his collection of DVDs,

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:56.920
there's like,

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.920
everything that Quentin Tarantino did,

01:16:58.920 --> 01:16:59.920
and he's like,

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.920
I'm sorry,

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:03.920
that you have to watch this movie?

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.920
If you went online,

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.920
and watched the,

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.920
since the reviews on the internet,

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:11.920
I wish you had not,

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:12.920
I wish you come in as a virgin,

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.920
and do not watch the,

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:15.920
come in just open.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:16.920
I feel,

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.920
I'm sorry for what I made.

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:20.920
And he spends 10 minutes

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.920
apologizing for his movie.

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:23.920
I'm glad I watched that,

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:24.920
because if I didn't,

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:25.920
I would never have watched it.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:26.920
If I see him,

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.920
I'm still gonna kick him in the dick.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.920
Don't watch murders,

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:31.920
but do.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:32.920
Well, Jeff,

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:33.920
I'm glad that this came up,

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:34.920
and in fact,

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:35.920
I knew it would,

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:37.920
because tonight has been

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.920
a labyrinthine manipulation

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.920
to get it to come up,

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.920
because the director of

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.920
Martyrs is actually here

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.920
in the front row.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:47.920
Here he comes.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:51.920
What's wrong?

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.920
Well, what's the problem?

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.920
I already apologized

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.920
in the thing.

01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.920
I just feel like you hate women.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:00.920
I love women.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:01.920
Well, yeah,

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:02.920
how come only women

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:03.920
get beaten up,

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:04.920
and the men never do?

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:05.920
Because they are there.

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.920
Why Clam Mount Everest?

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.920
The beautiful women are,

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.920
their ability to be beaten

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:15.920
is an expression

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.920
of post-modern alphabet.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.920
Post-modern alphabet.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:24.920
What would a post-modern alphabet be?

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.920
It would be like a woman,

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.920
it would be like the figure eight,

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.920
the violin,

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:29.920
the curves,

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:30.920
the femininity,

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.920
the beautiful punchable parts.

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.920
Now, I feel like,

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.920
because it's only women

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:38.920
being tortured,

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:39.920
brutalized,

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:40.920
and beaten to death,

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.920
to the point of,

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:43.920
like,

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:44.920
within an inch of their life,

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:45.920
and actually to death,

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:46.920
the fact that you made

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.920
the bad guy a woman

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:49.920
seems like an apology.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:50.920
That seems like you're just trying

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.920
to get away with misogyny

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:53.920
by making the over,

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.920
like,

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.920
the main bad guy also a woman.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:18:59.920
Touche.

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.920
End the shot.

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.920
Point at me and yell it.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:07.920
Point at me and yell it.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.920
Then do it.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:09.920
Do it.

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:10.920
Point at me and yell it.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:11.920
He should have ended the shot.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:12.920
I'll do it.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:13.920
I'll do it.

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:14.920
I'll do it.

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:15.920
No, no.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.920
It's too late.

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:17.920
No.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:18.920
I want you to beg for it,

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.920
you piece of shit.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:21.920
You're like a woman

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:22.920
strapped to a chair,

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.920
forced to poop in a bucket.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.920
You're martyling yourself right now.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:27.920
I want you to look

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.920
on your face when you die.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:30.920
I'm Barrow from the Masters,

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:31.920
the Eli Roth,

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.920
the Sam Peckinpah.

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.920
Oh, Sam Peckinpah.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:36.920
Again,

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:37.920
anybody,

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.920
let's see Sam Peckinpah films.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:40.920
Sam Peckinpah.

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:41.920
Zero.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.920
Welcome to the fucking Thunderdome.

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:44.920
Sam Peckinpah,

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:45.920
known as a great director.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.920
However,

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:47.920
in every fucking movie he made,

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.920
and enjoyed rape,

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.920
rape is justified.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920
Rape is not,

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.920
not case for rape.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.920
Yeah,

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.920
not just justified,

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.920
but women fucking like,

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920
no, no,

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:57.920
maybe,

01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:58.920
yes,

01:19:58.920 --> 01:19:59.920
oh,

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:00.920
my hero.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:01.920
Fucking boo.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.920
That guy is fucking gross.

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:04.920
Sam Peckinpah,

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.920
yeah, Wild Bunch is a good movie,

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.920
but still,

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.920
fucking,

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.920
that guy creepy.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.920
How about this?

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.920
Gentlemen,

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:12.920
there are men in the audience.

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.920
There's got to be a way to guarantee a closer.

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:15.920
There are men in the audience.

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:16.920
Does it have a costume contest?

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:17.920
A costume contest?

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:18.920
Yeah.

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:19.920
On a podcast?

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:20.920
Yeah.

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:21.920
All right, let's do it.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:22.920
No, no, no, no,

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:23.920
that's a bad idea.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:24.920
Let's do it.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.920
Yeah,

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.920
I would say

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:27.920
if you're a gentleman out there

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:28.920
that's a writer,

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.920
TV,

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:30.920
screenwriter,

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.920
films.

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.920
Come up and knock my hat off.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.920
Chew your idea.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:36.920
Zach,

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:37.920
back here,

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:38.920
our tech guys

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:39.920
wants you to wrap.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.920
Wrap up the show.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:42.920
Well,

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:43.920
wrap up the show.

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.920
Oh,

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.920
wrap like an art form,

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:47.920
like a Nelly,

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:48.920
someone called.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:49.920
How about this,

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:50.920
Dan?

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.920
Let's see if I can pull this off here.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.920
I'm going to pull up Johnny Cash.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:01.920
We're going to do a Johnny Cash song.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.920
Think about summing up the show right now.

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.920
Here's an interesting topic.

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.920
I bet you could break this room

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.920
into two groups of people,

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:12.920
people who like,

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.920
like keep listening to different songs

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:15.920
and then do,

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.920
I'm in the other group.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:18.920
Can you just like,

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:19.920
do you land on a song

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:20.920
and it doesn't matter,

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:21.920
like you just wear it out

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.920
or just like,

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:23.920
like put it on a loop

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:24.920
and you're just like,

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:25.920
oh,

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.920
I love this song.

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:27.920
And you get a little embarrassed about it.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.920
I remember when I was a kid,

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:30.920
my dad,

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:31.920
we're right now,

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.920
just to equate myself with this,

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:34.920
like,

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:35.920
because we were playing Rockstar

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:36.920
and that song

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:37.920
by the yeah, yeah, yeah,

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:38.920
is that like,

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:39.920
wait,

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:40.920
they don't love you

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:41.920
like I love you,

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:42.920
wait,

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:43.920
they don't love you.

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:44.920
I fucking love that song so much

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:45.920
and she playing it,

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:46.920
playing it,

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:47.920
playing it over and over.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:48.920
And,

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:49.920
but I remember my dad

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.920
when my parents separated,

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:52.920
he kept playing

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.920
turn around bright eyes, like,

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:56.920
total eclipse of the heart.

01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:57.920
Yeah, yeah,

01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:58.920
yeah,

01:21:58.920 --> 01:21:59.920
total eclipse of the heart.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.920
Parentheses turn around bright eyes.

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.920
I remember being in my room,

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:04.920
like 10 years old

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.920
and like hearing that song

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.920
on a boombox in my kitchen,

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.920
like living alone in a house

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:11.920
with my dad

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:12.920
and like,

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:13.920
like just hearing that song

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.920
just kept playing

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:15.920
over and over again.

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:16.920
And it was,

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:17.920
I couldn't leave the house.

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:18.920
I wanted to go play.

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:19.920
I was,

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.920
at that point,

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:21.920
finally willing to play baseball.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:22.920
I was,

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:23.920
I would do anything to get out of my room,

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:24.920
but I couldn't leave

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:26.920
because any path would take me past

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.920
my father who I could hear

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.920
was playing Eclipse of the Heart

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.920
like on a loop.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:32.920
It was really weird.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:33.920
You sang the house

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.920
with like a powder keg

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.920
and giving off sparks.

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.920
Wait, what?

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:39.920
I don't know.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.920
I really need you tonight.

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.920
Oh, yeah.

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:43.920
Yeah.

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:44.920
Yeah, I blacked it out.

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:45.920
I don't know.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:46.920
But it kept playing.

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:49.920
Come on, Harmon.

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:50.920
Which one is this?

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.920
I'm sorry this show was bad.

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:54.920
I'm sorry it went bad.

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.920
I'm sorry it got slower.

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.920
And that you rhymed bad with bad?

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:00.920
Oh, thank you.

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:02.920
Jeb Comptroller.

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.920
For signing with negativity.

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.920
I guarantee this won't be a closer.

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:12.920
Because it's impossible

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.920
to rhyme with negativity.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:17.920
Nativity.

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:23.920
Good night, everybody.

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.920
We fucking did it.

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.920
Thank you for coming to Harmontown once again.

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:32.920
No.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:33.920
No.

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:34.920
All right.

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:35.920
No.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:37.920
No.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.920
I knew you were going to say that.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.920
I knew you were going to say that.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.920
There will be a real closer.

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.920
No.

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.920
It'll be genuine.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:56.920
I'm defiant.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.920
I was going to end that motherfucker.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:23:59.920
No.

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:00.920
It doesn't matter.

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:01.920
You can end on anything.

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:02.920
These people have all been at things

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:03.920
that have ended badly.

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.920
I don't accept that ending.

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.920
There's got to be a new way.

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:13.920
Fuck.

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:14.920
All right.

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:15.920
There's no way out.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:16.920
All right.

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:17.920
You're on your own.

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.920
There's got to be a way out.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.920
There's no way out.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:20.920
There's got to be a way out.

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:21.920
No.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:22.920
These people are hostages.

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:23.920
No.

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:24.920
There's a way out.

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:25.920
There's a way out.

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:26.920
All right.

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:27.920
The guy is fucking settled in.

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:28.920
This is it.

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:29.920
All right.

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:30.920
You, sir.

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.920
What's your name?

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.920
Andy.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:33.920
Andy.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:34.920
Okay.

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.920
Andy, what's your favorite comfort food?

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.920
That's tough, Andy says.

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:39.920
Steak.

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:40.920
Okay.

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.920
Andy likes steak.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:42.920
Okay.

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:43.920
All right.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:44.920
All right.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:45.920
What's your name, sir?

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.920
Jason.

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.920
Okay.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:52.920
What is your least favorite food?

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:53.920
Seafood.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:54.920
Seafood.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:55.920
Okay.

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:56.920
All right.

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:57.920
Andy likes steak.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.920
Jason hates seafood.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:05.920
And that is the title of the movie I'm about to improvise.

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:10.920
Do you want theme music or are you good?

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:15.920
Theme music, please, obviously.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.920
No, hang on.

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.920
We can do better than that.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:24.920
Sir, something's gone wrong.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:27.920
What is it, Jason?

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.920
It's the steak.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.920
It's threatening all the seafood.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:37.920
Let's get out there and rectify that situation.

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:41.920
Yeah, I just, I was coming here to suggest that.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:45.920
I can't go over your head.

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.920
I wasn't saying that you should.

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:51.920
I'm just like, sir, is there something wrong?

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:52.920
Yeah, I get insecure.

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.920
I feel like I got promoted before you.

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.920
Don't let that worry you.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.920
I've always respected you.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.920
I know that.

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.920
Let's get out there.

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.920
Get the Jeep.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.920
The steak Jeep?

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.920
Tom Clancy Chiron, steak zone, sector seven.

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:22.920
Incoming seafood!

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:32.920
Let's go fuck up some seafood, motherfuckers!

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:39.920
Gentlemen, sector seven is clear.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.920
All in the steak zone, say, who are...

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.920
I suggest we camp out for the...

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.920
What was that?

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:49.920
I got movement.

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:50.920
What?

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.920
Stand down, Lieutenant.

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:54.920
No, sir, I got movement.

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.920
You will silence yourself.

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:57.920
We're going on R&R.

01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.920
Our hubris is primary.

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.920
We will relax.

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.920
We will not pay attention to any incoming data.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.920
But sir, I don't...

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.920
Seafood!

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:11.920
Oh, shit!

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.920
Oh, my fucking asshole!

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:16.920
Oh, I'm getting ripped out of my pussy!

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:18.920
Oh, my intestines!

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.920
Oh, shit, Obamacare!

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.920
Mitt Romney, hot buddies!

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.920
Monica Lewinsky, cigars!

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:25.920
Got milk!

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.920
Closer!

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.920
We did it!

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:32.920
Nerd milk!

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:36.920
It's been my pleasure to rip the fucking roof off this place!

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.920
Mic drop!

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.920
Sorry.

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.920
Oh, boy.

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.920
Dan Harmon.

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.920
Everybody.

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.920
In an unclosable show.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:55.920
He closed it.

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.920
Keep your applause going if you would.

01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.920
For Katie Levine, our audio recorder.

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.920
Dr. Keeber, our tech.

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.920

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:13.920
Jeff Davis, this is Harmontown.

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.920
Thank you all for coming.

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.920
Spencer, our Dungeon Master.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.920
Great patient, thank you.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.920
Greg, our Dungeon Master assistants.

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:26.920
God bless you all for suffering through

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:29.920
what might be the greatest night in podcast history.

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.920
Let's all get drunk together, won't we?

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.920
We love you.

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.920
Danadoo.

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:39.920
Danadoo.
