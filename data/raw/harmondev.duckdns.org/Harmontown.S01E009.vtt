{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:16.440\nHere you, here you, Harmontown is in session.\n\n00:16.440 --> 00:20.080\nWelcome everybody to the NerdMill Theater in Hollywood, California.\n\n00:20.080 --> 00:21.080\nHow are you tonight?\n\n00:21.080 --> 00:22.080\nFantastic.\n\n00:22.080 --> 00:29.080\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:29.080 --> 00:46.600\nHe's doing a little dance, little side to side, his feet are going side to side, his\n\n00:46.600 --> 00:47.600\nhands are on his hips.\n\n00:47.600 --> 00:54.080\nOh yeah, sorry, it's a podcast, sorry, sorry about that podcast listeners.\n\n00:54.080 --> 00:56.080\nYou can't just dance on a podcast.\n\n00:56.080 --> 00:58.600\nOh, you can, and you should.\n\n00:58.600 --> 01:03.760\nThat's like the, when people who are big fans of LPs, that was the cracks, pops, and whistles\n\n01:03.760 --> 01:08.040\nof listening to old school audio recordings metaphorically.\n\n01:08.040 --> 01:12.320\nYou don't see the little kicky dance when you listen to a Harmontown podcast, you have\n\n01:12.320 --> 01:13.920\nto come here to NerdMill.\n\n01:13.920 --> 01:18.760\nYour dances, historically speaking, are very kicky based, there's lots of little toe kicks\n\n01:18.760 --> 01:19.760\nto the side.\n\n01:19.760 --> 01:26.600\nI'm a little baby, and I'm getting prouder of it as I get older, which is good in a\n\n01:26.600 --> 01:32.560\nKubrickian sense, because as we know, we do become babies as we get older.\n\n01:32.560 --> 01:37.920\nIn my 30s, in my early 30s, there was a shame of the fact that I was a baby, because you'd\n\n01:37.920 --> 01:43.080\ngo out with women, sooner or later they find out you're a baby, and they actually say the\n\n01:43.080 --> 01:52.800\nwords, you're a baby, or you say them, I'm a baby, and I found a girlfriend who is okay\n\n01:52.800 --> 01:55.600\nwith me being a baby.\n\n01:55.600 --> 02:03.400\nI specifically enjoy being what she calls a little cloud baby.\n\n02:03.400 --> 02:05.640\nWould you explain?\n\n02:05.640 --> 02:11.240\nI'd be happy to, because we're in a good mood tonight.\n\n02:11.240 --> 02:16.760\nI have a big down comforter in my room, and it's white, and I like to crawl under it and\n\n02:16.760 --> 02:20.920\nhold it up to my chin, and make a little baby face.\n\n02:20.920 --> 02:30.800\nAaron makes a sound that is exactly half horror, half orgasm.\n\n02:30.800 --> 02:31.800\nHorror?\n\n02:31.800 --> 02:32.800\nHorror?\n\n02:32.800 --> 02:33.800\nYeah.\n\n02:33.800 --> 02:40.200\nWell, because she's going out with a baby, and she wants a baby, but she doesn't want\n\n02:40.200 --> 02:42.200\nto have to fuck it.\n\n02:42.200 --> 02:50.280\nNo, but it's making her dignity and her ovaries fight each other and explode.\n\n02:50.280 --> 02:53.600\nIt's like a twilight zone, be careful what you wish for.\n\n02:53.600 --> 02:59.600\nYeah, I can't imitate it, but I can make a little baby face in bed that will make Aaron\n\n02:59.600 --> 03:02.600\ngo, yeah!\n\n03:02.600 --> 03:10.560\nWell, I'm in a good mood because I got a call from my doctor today, and I got really, really,\n\n03:10.560 --> 03:14.760\nreally bad news from him.\n\n03:14.760 --> 03:15.760\nCongratulations.\n\n03:15.760 --> 03:23.760\nI had lab work done, like they suck the plasma out of your body, and then they send it off\n\n03:23.760 --> 03:27.440\nto a lab, and you fill out a clipboard.\n\n03:27.440 --> 03:28.440\nWhat do you want checked?\n\n03:28.440 --> 03:29.440\nI want everything checked.\n\n03:29.440 --> 03:32.560\nI want to know if I've ever come close to herpes.\n\n03:32.560 --> 03:39.120\nI want to know if I've eaten waffles, I want to know what my liver's doing, I want to know\n\n03:39.120 --> 03:40.120\nmy kidneys, everything.\n\n03:40.120 --> 03:44.400\nOkay, this is a little over going to take a while, okay, fine, just give it to me.\n\n03:44.400 --> 03:49.240\nThis is time, I'm 39, and it's been a month that they called me today.\n\n03:49.240 --> 03:55.480\nThere was a mix-up with the phone number and they finally called me, and it's dark news\n\n03:55.480 --> 03:59.000\nbecause I'm in perfect condition, and the reason it's dark is because now I'm going\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:05.000\nto kill myself, like because I feel like he-man.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.360\nI've done nothing but abuse my body.\n\n04:07.360 --> 04:11.920\nMy doctor called me today and said, your cholesterol is well within allowances.\n\n04:11.920 --> 04:18.120\nYou know, we're a fat country, so I prefer to look at ideals.\n\n04:18.120 --> 04:19.760\nYou're one point away from the ideal.\n\n04:19.760 --> 04:24.120\nI think if you do a little bit of exercise, you can knock it down to the ideal.\n\n04:24.120 --> 04:25.120\nIdeal?\n\n04:25.120 --> 04:31.760\nI'm going to go to the Olympics with my cholesterol.\n\n04:31.760 --> 04:33.520\nMy liver's fine?\n\n04:33.520 --> 04:36.120\nAre you kidding me?\n\n04:36.120 --> 04:37.120\nThat is a lie.\n\n04:37.120 --> 04:41.120\nAre you sure he's a doctor?\n\n04:41.120 --> 04:42.960\nThat might not be a doctor.\n\n04:42.960 --> 04:49.720\nIt may be an elaborate Kettle One-sponsor-con job.\n\n04:49.720 --> 04:54.440\nI walk out of the place, and the whole facade of the Beverly Hills hospital falls down,\n\n04:54.440 --> 04:56.760\nand it becomes a Kettle One factory.\n\n04:56.760 --> 05:01.200\nIt becomes a truck and drives off.\n\n05:01.200 --> 05:03.000\nWell, it worked.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:12.440\nI'm going to do a little bit of exercise from now on, and knock that, what's the LDL on\n\n05:12.440 --> 05:13.440\nthe HDL?\n\n05:13.440 --> 05:14.440\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n05:14.440 --> 05:15.440\nWho cares?\n\n05:15.440 --> 05:16.840\nBut here's what I care about.\n\n05:16.840 --> 05:18.000\nI'm in perfect shape, Jeff.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.520\nI'm a perfect specimen.\n\n05:20.520 --> 05:25.680\nLet's have a- I'm a super baby, a super cloud baby.\n\n05:25.680 --> 05:27.240\nThere's nothing wrong with me.\n\n05:27.240 --> 05:29.240\nI have my blood sugar is low.\n\n05:29.240 --> 05:31.080\nI can't get diabetes.\n\n05:31.080 --> 05:32.480\nI could eat a million Twinkies.\n\n05:32.480 --> 05:33.480\nI can't get diabetes.\n\n05:33.480 --> 05:34.480\nIt's impossible.\n\n05:34.480 --> 05:35.480\nThat's not true.\n\n05:35.480 --> 05:36.480\nNo.\n\n05:36.480 --> 05:37.480\nYou can get diabetes at some point.\n\n05:37.480 --> 05:38.480\nIf we live long enough, we'll all get diabetes.\n\n05:38.480 --> 05:39.480\nYou're not a doctor.\n\n05:39.480 --> 05:42.560\nIt's an age- it's an age-onset disease.\n\n05:42.560 --> 05:44.880\nIf you live to be a hundred, you're going to get diabetes.\n\n05:44.880 --> 05:48.000\nIf I live to be a hundred, they're going to have laser spiders that go in your veins and\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\ncure your diabetes.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:55.200\nDan, we're 200 years away from laser spider technology.\n\n05:55.200 --> 05:56.960\nWe're 100 years away from laser spider technology.\n\n05:56.960 --> 06:00.800\nYou're talking like you know that all of a sudden you know a lot about sci-fi.\n\n06:00.800 --> 06:01.800\nOh.\n\n06:01.800 --> 06:02.800\nNo.\n\n06:02.800 --> 06:03.800\nThank you for the segue, Jeff.\n\n06:03.800 --> 06:05.800\nI went to the Chicago US.\n\n06:05.800 --> 06:12.640\nAlso, not only can you not see our Kiki dance, you couldn't see my smug satisfaction about\n\n06:12.640 --> 06:13.640\nthat segue.\n\n06:13.640 --> 06:20.200\nI feel like- part of my instinct is because last week what we did is we had, and even\n\n06:20.200 --> 06:24.360\npeople who- unless you were here last week in person because we haven't podcasted that\n\n06:24.360 --> 06:29.320\nepisode yet, you don't know, we brought Spencer up when we embarked on our first D&D campaign\n\n06:29.320 --> 06:33.000\nwith Spencer.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:37.880\nAnd I'll probably let him recap it, but we-\n\n06:37.880 --> 06:43.560\nI fucking hope so because I remember- we talked about mirrors for a long time.\n\n06:43.560 --> 06:47.920\nWe were pretty drunk, but we met on a road and we killed some goblins.\n\n06:47.920 --> 06:50.480\nWe went into a cave.\n\n06:50.480 --> 06:51.480\nLots of mirrors and lots of-\n\n06:51.480 --> 06:57.680\nAnd then there was a lot of like- it was like a puzzle game for baby boomers, like missed\n\n06:57.680 --> 07:03.880\nwith a Y, like- it's like you rotate the mirror and then there was like a statue that\n\n07:03.880 --> 07:06.600\nwas red and then there was a shield that was red and-\n\n07:06.600 --> 07:07.600\nSpencer-\n\n07:07.600 --> 07:09.600\nWe were so drunk and-\n\n07:09.600 --> 07:13.760\nSpencer, who is our dungeon master, for those of us who are- or those of you who are not\n\n07:13.760 --> 07:21.160\nfollowing the saga of our D&D campaign, he walked up to me outside- when people are waiting\n\n07:21.160 --> 07:27.560\nin line here at Meltdown Comics and comes up and he goes, he opened up his book and\n\n07:27.560 --> 07:32.640\ngoes, oh shit, I thought I forgot your characters, but I have them, but I forgot my die, I forgot\n\n07:32.640 --> 07:34.760\nmy 20-sided die.\n\n07:34.760 --> 07:41.000\nAnd so we went to the front desk here at the comic book store and they were out of them.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:45.840\nAnd so yeah, so he's going to be rolling dice for us on his iPod application tonight.\n\n07:45.840 --> 07:47.200\nOh, really?\n\n07:47.200 --> 07:49.720\nBecause nobody here has a die.\n\n07:49.720 --> 07:50.720\n20-sided?\n\n07:50.720 --> 07:51.720\nNo.\n\n07:51.720 --> 07:52.720\nJesus.\n\n07:52.720 --> 07:53.720\nOkay, really.\n\n07:53.720 --> 07:59.240\nWell, I think it's shame that's keeping you from admitting that you do.\n\n07:59.240 --> 08:03.960\nIf I aim for ignorance, I think some of you are wearing your shirt from prom night and\n\n08:03.960 --> 08:06.760\nyou forgot you have a 20-sided in your pocket.\n\n08:06.760 --> 08:11.920\nDoes anybody have a 20-sided die on them right now?\n\n08:11.920 --> 08:14.640\nAlways always keep it on you.\n\n08:14.640 --> 08:15.880\nYou would have been a hero tonight.\n\n08:15.880 --> 08:18.120\nWell, we'll resume our thing with Spencer.\n\n08:18.120 --> 08:23.240\nWell, that's what I was struggling with, was do we want to warm up for Spencer or do we\n\n08:23.240 --> 08:27.440\nwant to get him in early so that we're not so drunk that when we get hit with a mirror\n\n08:27.440 --> 08:31.840\npuzzle, like, you know, that was the problem.\n\n08:31.840 --> 08:32.840\nYou're the mayor, baby.\n\n08:32.840 --> 08:33.840\nAll right.\n\n08:33.840 --> 08:37.480\nWell, I want to hear a little bit.\n\n08:37.480 --> 08:40.280\nBefore we bring Spencer up, I want to hear a little bit about your trip because I haven't\n\n08:40.280 --> 08:46.080\nseen you for four days and I went to San Francisco and Chicago since the last time we talked\n\n08:46.080 --> 08:47.080\nabout anything.\n\n08:47.080 --> 08:49.120\nSan Francisco, I thought there was an interesting thing.\n\n08:49.120 --> 08:54.480\nI don't know if, you know, podcast listeners, some of you maybe are in San Francisco.\n\n08:54.480 --> 08:58.360\nThere's a guy on the outside the ferry building.\n\n08:58.360 --> 09:03.600\nHe's a very old, like, very Morgan Freeman-y black gentleman.\n\n09:03.600 --> 09:10.920\nHe's wearing an old kind of like suit, like, it's his only suit, kind of, you could sense\n\n09:10.920 --> 09:11.920\nthat.\n\n09:11.920 --> 09:13.360\nHe gets up in the morning and puts on his one suit.\n\n09:13.360 --> 09:15.320\nHe gives you a very Morgan Freeman vibe.\n\n09:15.320 --> 09:18.240\nWhat do you mean specifically by a Morgan?\n\n09:18.240 --> 09:26.960\nWell, you want him to tell you how to golf or play the clarinet or use the force or be\n\n09:26.960 --> 09:29.680\na librarian or love a woman.\n\n09:29.680 --> 09:31.760\nYou want him to, like...\n\n09:31.760 --> 09:33.640\nYou want a mystical black friend.\n\n09:33.640 --> 09:34.640\nYeah.\n\n09:34.640 --> 09:36.440\nHe zoos that air.\n\n09:36.440 --> 09:41.520\nHe's ancient and he's got a big smile on his face and he's holding a clarinet and he's\n\n09:41.520 --> 09:48.200\ngot the clarinet case with a recyclable bag in it for tips and he's got a hat on.\n\n09:48.200 --> 09:52.280\nAnd when I walked up to, Aaron was going to the bathroom, the bathroom line was so long\n\n09:52.280 --> 09:54.800\nthat I got to kind of study this guy for a while.\n\n09:54.800 --> 10:00.440\nSo if you walk past him, all you see is, oh, it's a master of clarinet sitting on the,\n\n10:00.440 --> 10:05.200\nliterally on the dock of the bay, hanging out.\n\n10:05.200 --> 10:06.200\nWatching the tide.\n\n10:06.200 --> 10:07.200\nRoll away.\n\n10:07.200 --> 10:09.840\nAnd my God, I wish I was a better person.\n\n10:09.840 --> 10:16.440\nI wish I had more appreciation for whatever jazzy arts he could impart to me.\n\n10:16.440 --> 10:22.200\nI was waiting for Aaron so long that I kind of stood behind him and watched what was really\n\n10:22.200 --> 10:23.200\nhappening.\n\n10:23.200 --> 10:24.200\nHe's really just...\n\n10:24.200 --> 10:31.360\nHe knows as much clarinet as I do, because he kept doing this thing, it was like an SNL\n\n10:31.360 --> 10:32.360\nsketch.\n\n10:32.360 --> 10:39.240\nHe was continually re-reading his clarinet while he was talking to people.\n\n10:39.240 --> 10:42.520\nHe would shout out to people and then they'd stop and talk to him.\n\n10:42.520 --> 10:47.000\nAnd then he was just continually in preparation to play the clarinet.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:54.200\nWhen I walked up to him, when I arrived at him, it was at the end of an encounter that\n\n10:54.200 --> 10:59.560\nhe was having for seemingly hours with this old white couple that were like, oh, no, no,\n\n10:59.560 --> 11:00.560\nwe got to go.\n\n11:00.560 --> 11:04.080\nI'm sorry, we never got to hear you play, but here's the first five dollars.\n\n11:04.080 --> 11:07.000\nAnd he's like, oh, I'll take care of her, oh, I wouldn't want to have her.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:12.280\nAnd then this other weird encounter happened where a guy walked by, it's like an 80-year-old\n\n11:12.280 --> 11:17.680\nguy with a 50-year-old woman.\n\n11:17.680 --> 11:22.920\nAnd the clarinet guy said, oh, what's going on?\n\n11:22.920 --> 11:25.040\nHe would just shout stuff out at random people.\n\n11:25.040 --> 11:30.280\nHe'd shout at several things out at me, but I'm a generation X, so I'd just go, huh,\n\n11:30.280 --> 11:33.000\nand look at a bird.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:39.080\nBut old white people would stop and go, well, you know, just the weather and the knees and\n\n11:39.080 --> 11:44.600\nthe kneecaps, ah, like they would have this old person language with like, ah, Truman\n\n11:44.600 --> 11:51.720\nnever got to eat, and they would engage each other, it was ants, you know, like a specific\n\n11:51.720 --> 11:54.680\nspecies would get into it.\n\n11:54.680 --> 12:00.640\nAnd so that happened, he snagged another old guy, it was like this 50-year-old white\n\n12:00.640 --> 12:08.400\nwoman and the old white guy, and the old white guy said, well, this is my daughter, and he\n\n12:08.400 --> 12:13.320\nsaid, oh, I thought that was your wife.\n\n12:13.320 --> 12:18.080\nAnd then the old guy said, oh, you wish me to have a heart attack?\n\n12:18.080 --> 12:22.720\nWell, a woman this age, you know, that's a good way to wish you made me to get a heart\n\n12:22.720 --> 12:28.480\nattack, you know, fucking my daughter.\n\n12:28.480 --> 12:33.320\nThat's 22% of deaths over the age of 75.\n\n12:33.320 --> 12:40.120\nAnd then he kept walking away, and then the clarinet guy, he waited, it was like a block\n\n12:40.120 --> 12:43.960\naway the guy, no way he was going to hear him, but he kind of like, the gears ground\n\n12:43.960 --> 12:48.640\nand he kind of heard him, and then he thought of something to say to it, I wish sometimes\n\n12:48.640 --> 12:57.120\nshe was your wife, though, and then he finally, finally, played string of pearls.\n\n12:57.120 --> 13:00.720\nSo the 30 minutes that it took Aaron to go to the bathroom of this place, because the\n\n13:00.720 --> 13:05.040\nline was so long, I finally saw this guy finally put this thing to his lips, because I think\n\n13:05.040 --> 13:11.000\npart of the thing is, you know, he needs to at some point create a seam of like illusion\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:15.860\nthat like he just finished or just started playing clarinet, always just finished, always\n\n13:15.860 --> 13:18.360\njust finished.\n\n13:18.360 --> 13:22.680\nI was in his blind side, you know, like I was standing behind him, like flanking him\n\n13:22.680 --> 13:26.640\nand just watching him, and so he put the clarinet to his lips, and I was like, okay, here we\n\n13:26.640 --> 13:27.640\ngo.\n\n13:27.640 --> 13:56.960\nI blow my mind, or confirm what I suspect, and he went,\n\n13:56.960 --> 14:08.000\nyeah, like, that's, that's already shot, scales, I think he was doing, but worse, because\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:13.680\nhe hadn't seen sound of music, and then put his prop back down, and then just started\n\n14:13.680 --> 14:18.440\nshouting out everybody up here, I don't know if that's, you know, interesting to anybody,\n\n14:18.440 --> 14:24.280\nbut I thought it was very interesting, the clarinet is a very difficult instrument, there's\n\n14:24.280 --> 14:29.400\na guy, there's a guy that lives on my street, I don't know if he lives on my street, there's\n\n14:29.400 --> 14:36.960\na mystery person, I went away on a trip to France last year, and for three months before\n\n14:36.960 --> 14:47.360\nI left town, I would hear, and it was like, start quiet and get louder and louder and\n\n14:47.360 --> 14:51.480\nlouder, and there was a clarinetist that had just taken up like fucking residence on my\n\n14:51.480 --> 14:57.000\nstreet, and he would wander around, and I never saw him, and I went out of town, apparently\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:02.080\nhe had taken up residence on my lawn, and actually, somebody, a neighbor called the police and\n\n15:02.080 --> 15:08.640\ntook him to jail, the guy went to jail, and I wanted to kill the guy, because it was like,\n\n15:08.640 --> 15:13.640\nthe clarinet is not an easy instrument to play, it was terrible, and so he went to jail\n\n15:13.640 --> 15:17.480\nfor a while apparently, now he's re-emerged, and I don't know the name of the instrument,\n\n15:17.480 --> 15:26.480\nbut it's the one that you charm a snake with, in the middle of the fucking morning or afternoon,\n\n15:26.480 --> 15:32.520\nthere's a guy at the cobra phone, the cobra phone, and I finally saw him, he's an old\n\n15:32.520 --> 15:40.040\nwisdom grade bearded guy with a giant clarinet thing with ribbons hanging off of it, it's\n\n15:40.040 --> 15:41.040\nthe worst.\n\n15:41.040 --> 15:46.680\nDo you remember the guy, were you living in Los Feliz when that guy, he was a living,\n\n15:46.680 --> 15:58.680\nhe was the forest gump of 9-11, the Persian guy, one day before 9-11, not Iranian, Persian.\n\n15:58.680 --> 16:04.680\nEvery day before leading up to 9-11, because I lived in Los Feliz from 90, whatever, 2001,\n\n16:04.680 --> 16:09.000\nlike just every single day at the same time of day, there would be this guy, you would\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:16.280\nhear him at any place in Los Feliz, he wasn't homeless, but he was clearly mentally ill,\n\n16:16.280 --> 16:19.880\nI think he had a support system, and then his support system would say, yes, you can\n\n16:19.880 --> 16:28.520\ntake a walk, Kyle, and then on his walk, it was just an hour a day, I don't want to be\n\n16:28.520 --> 16:32.440\nlike Larry the Cable Guy and give him a name that I'm going to regret, but I don't want\n\n16:32.440 --> 16:43.240\nto riff a name, but I want to assume his name's Kyle, his name was Xerxes, every day at the\n\n16:43.240 --> 16:47.280\nsame time, you would just hear this like in the distance, because I would be riding with\n\n16:47.280 --> 16:57.120\nSchrab in my living room, and then you'd just hear from way in the distance here, and there'd\n\n16:57.120 --> 17:01.560\nbe like a Doppler effect, because he'd walk past your place like an ice cream man, and\n\n17:01.560 --> 17:06.560\nit was before 9-11, and it didn't really matter, it was just like, oh, that's a different kind\n\n17:06.560 --> 17:11.480\nof crazy guy, it's better than saying I want to strangle your children, I can't understand\n\n17:11.480 --> 17:15.560\nit, it's kind of delicious, I like it, it's like an orange pop-up instead of the traditional\n\n17:15.560 --> 17:23.480\nvanilla bean, and then fucking, it was so clear, like 9-11 happened, and because I was\n\n17:23.480 --> 17:28.600\nliving in the same place, and you just like never ever, that guy vanished, and he was like,\n\n17:28.600 --> 17:32.880\nhe did like some white van came and just sucked him up with a vacuum cleaner.\n\n17:32.880 --> 17:39.560\nNo, I think his family said, Kyle, no more walks, they're watching the news, as much\n\n17:39.560 --> 17:43.000\nas we'd like you to get out of the house once in a while, we don't want you to get killed.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:49.000\nYeah, they were watching the news of 7-11s with American flags draped in the front windows\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:54.960\nbecause everyone was terrified of everybody, it was a horrible time, a lot of you were\n\n17:54.960 --> 18:02.560\nsix, and don't remember how horrifying it was, I remember the moments after 9-11, driving\n\n18:02.560 --> 18:08.000\nwith Jeff, my comptroller down Franklin Avenue, over where birds and UCB is there now, it\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:14.800\nwasn't there then, and I remember just driving at night, and you couldn't drive, it was exactly\n\n18:14.800 --> 18:21.120\nlike after a hockey game, where someone won or lost that wasn't significant to the same\n\n18:21.120 --> 18:28.320\ndemographic, like the traffic blockers, because 9-11 happened and there was just, the traffic\n\n18:28.320 --> 18:32.080\nwas slow everywhere, you're like, why is traffic slow, is there a 9-11 happening here too?\n\n18:32.080 --> 18:38.680\nNo, it's just a bunch of 9-11 fans out in the street, and they're lining the street with\n\n18:38.680 --> 18:44.640\nsome of them with candles, okay fine, that's sentimental, that's nice, but I remember seeing\n\n18:44.640 --> 18:51.560\na bunch of dudes with baseball caps on backwards with a bed sheet that said USA on it, a bed\n\n18:51.560 --> 18:56.400\nsheet that they just grabbed, I was like, wait Steve, grab the bed sheet, and write the name\n\n18:56.400 --> 19:03.680\nof our country on it, it's crucial that we do it now, we're about to lose everything,\n\n19:03.680 --> 19:11.800\nthe towers have gone down, our beds are next, let them know on Franklin Avenue what country\n\n19:11.800 --> 19:18.840\nthis is, and they were chanting or driving, the cars were like, it was bumper-to-bumper\n\n19:18.840 --> 19:25.640\ntraffic, gridlock, and it was just people going, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, and Jeff\n\n19:25.640 --> 19:32.840\nand I were coiling down in our seats, we're actors and writers, we're dead, the next ten\n\n19:32.840 --> 19:43.040\nyears is not going to be fun, but then we elected a black man, so what did I know?\n\n19:43.040 --> 19:50.200\nThat was several years later, society's never finished when you think it is, we're progressive,\n\n19:50.200 --> 19:56.360\nit seemed that night that we were dead, do you have any, what do you think, Obama, Romney,\n\n19:56.360 --> 19:59.360\nwho do you like?\n\n19:59.360 --> 20:09.560\nBoy, that Romney, he's got pluck, I spent five minutes, I thought that was a bit, I thought\n\n20:09.560 --> 20:14.440\nit was a bit that he was actually the finalist, that he was the new McCain, I thought there\n\n20:14.440 --> 20:21.440\nwas an actual onion bit or something, he says nothing, it's insane, he's like a parody\n\n20:21.440 --> 20:28.120\nof a parody of something that's already a parody, I'm not even, I characterize myself\n\n20:28.120 --> 20:33.280\nas being left of what most people would call liberal because I really don't like the idea\n\n20:33.280 --> 20:39.640\nthat we all accept that government is necessary, it's a bummer and I know it is to keep everything\n\n20:39.640 --> 20:47.480\nin place now, but I think that it should be our goal to go, what, can't everybody stop\n\n20:47.480 --> 20:51.720\ntelling people what to do, I just don't like this class of people running against each\n\n20:51.720 --> 20:55.680\nother in these popularity contests and they've never done anything in their life, they've\n\n20:55.680 --> 20:59.360\nnever lifted a box, they've never washed a dish, they've never written anything, they've\n\n20:59.360 --> 21:07.320\nnever directed anything, I skewed charge my current audience in the last couple, they\n\n21:07.320 --> 21:12.520\nwere never nominated for a Hugo award, they don't know how to blow glass, they don't know\n\n21:12.520 --> 21:17.760\nhow to take care of children, they don't know how to eat their own food, I doubt, I bet\n\n21:17.760 --> 21:22.680\nthere's a guy that squeezes like a fireplace thing into their mouth with pudding in it\n\n21:22.680 --> 21:29.400\nor something, or like Robocop paste, that's designed to keep them more political, they're\n\n21:29.400 --> 21:36.840\nnot real people, they don't do anything, it's democracy, so the idea is supposed to be,\n\n21:36.840 --> 21:43.000\nthe ideal is supposed to be that we would all be farming and then we would go, hey Steve,\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:48.480\nyou gotta be a councilman and Steve would go, fuck you, I got farming to do, sorry Steve,\n\n21:48.480 --> 21:54.920\nyou're a very charismatic farmer, we need you to go to the big city and make sure that\n\n21:54.920 --> 21:59.640\nthey understand how hard it is to farm out here, all right, but fuck you guys, two years\n\n21:59.640 --> 22:06.440\nand I'm out, exactly, it's written into the rules, and that's supposed to trickle up that\n\n22:06.440 --> 22:11.120\nmentality, like the guy that's president should be like to everyone in America, fuck you,\n\n22:11.120 --> 22:16.520\nfor making me do this, but I will spend, because I'm an American, I will spend the next four\n\n22:16.520 --> 22:20.560\nyears trying to make it as easy on you as possible, I'll try to keep these trains running\n\n22:20.560 --> 22:26.320\non time, and it just, but you know, our predilection for hero worship and royalty fucking took over,\n\n22:26.320 --> 22:33.120\nand then who seeps in, these disgusting gross Oxford shirted fucking, they just gross schmooze,\n\n22:33.120 --> 22:38.440\nthese people, they're proto human, they don't, none of them, and I'm sorry, but I include\n\n22:38.440 --> 22:44.360\nall your favorite people, and I think that, I do, and the fact that I'm afraid to say\n\n22:44.360 --> 22:51.520\nthe words, I include Obama for fear that I'll get, like politics turns us all into fascists,\n\n22:51.520 --> 22:56.200\nyou start to get afraid to say the wrong thing around your friends, and they capitalize\n\n22:56.200 --> 23:01.080\non that, instead of going the other way, which is to say, look, we all have a wolf in us,\n\n23:01.080 --> 23:05.520\nwe all want to chew each other's throats out, but we're also all monkeys, like we all just\n\n23:05.520 --> 23:11.600\nwant to fucking eat berries, so like let's try to spiritually realign ourselves, let's\n\n23:11.600 --> 23:17.200\nfind the sweet spot, yeah, right in the middle, like, that's what humans are, we're the monkeys\n\n23:17.200 --> 23:23.360\nthat survived wolves by turning, by adopting their practices a little bit, but we gotta,\n\n23:23.360 --> 23:29.920\nyou know, that's just such a bummer, every four years it gets more and more, I get more\n\n23:29.920 --> 23:34.000\nand more crotchety, and I don't know what to do about it, young people get so excited\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:39.040\nand you don't want to piss on that, because, like, of course Obama's a better president\n\n23:39.040 --> 23:44.160\nthan some fucking clone from a Republican vat in a basement, like, of the Pentagon,\n\n23:44.160 --> 23:52.760\nlike, of obviously, but that's like saying, like, diet Pepsi's better than piss, like,\n\n23:52.760 --> 24:00.120\nneither of its water, like, water is what you need, you're dying of thirst, like, we\n\n24:00.120 --> 24:06.560\nneed to sustain ourselves, we're human beings, and I feel the same way about religious debate,\n\n24:06.560 --> 24:11.320\nyou know, when people go, oh, are you an atheist, or are you one of these snake handler types,\n\n24:11.320 --> 24:15.800\nyou know, I got like, like, oh, yeah, I have to choose between those two, you guys are\n\n24:15.800 --> 24:22.120\nall on the same side, when you kneel before a fundamentalist god and like, quiver and\n\n24:22.120 --> 24:28.600\ngo like, oh, the Bible's a newspaper, here's what happened last Wednesday in 3,000 BC,\n\n24:28.600 --> 24:32.200\nand also when you're getting out your slide rule and going like, well, I don't know until\n\n24:32.200 --> 24:39.480\nI prove it, you all agree on one thing, you're all on the same side, because if I said one\n\n24:39.480 --> 24:45.840\nthing, I could make you all disagree with me, if I said, Dan Harmon is god, atheists and\n\n24:45.840 --> 24:50.600\nscientists would all throw rocks at me, they would all go, you're wrong, you're wrong,\n\n24:50.600 --> 25:01.480\nyou're not god, but maybe I am, why is that not allowed, that's the Ralph Nader of religion,\n\n25:01.480 --> 25:06.320\nbut for each of us, you're god, you're god, you're god, you're god, like everyone's going\n\n25:06.320 --> 25:10.560\nlike, step right up to the taste test, do you believe in god or not believe in god, last\n\n25:10.560 --> 25:13.680\nname first, last name second, do you believe in god or not believe in god, do you believe\n\n25:13.680 --> 25:19.240\nin god, do you choose between math and story about eating by a whale, you have to choose,\n\n25:19.240 --> 25:23.600\nyou have to choose, you have to choose, no, I don't have to choose, because both of those\n\n25:23.600 --> 25:28.040\nexist and both came out of my species mind, I'm capable, I have a processor in my brain\n\n25:28.040 --> 25:31.880\nthat's more powerful than anything Apple could ever generate, because it's capable of thinking\n\n25:31.880 --> 25:38.200\ntwo things at once, both equally, I am capable of creation, I am capable of mysticism, I\n\n25:38.200 --> 25:45.080\nam capable of mythology, I'm capable of approaching my life from a logical and a mythical perspective,\n\n25:45.080 --> 25:49.480\nbut incapable of both and you want to compromise me, you want me in shackles, don't make me\n\n25:49.480 --> 25:55.680\nchoose between Pepsi and Coke, because you're just pushing corn syrup, that's it, and I\n\n25:55.680 --> 25:59.760\nfeel that way about politics and I feel that way about religion, and god damn it, I was\n\n25:59.760 --> 26:10.680\nin a good mood when I came up here, we should bring Spencer up, Spencer get up here, Dungeon\n\n26:10.680 --> 26:23.960\nMaster Spencer, how's it going, come on stay Spencer, say hello to the crowd, let me get\n\n26:23.960 --> 26:36.800\nup here, hello audience, Spencer I'm guessing you're a cat person, yeah I have a cat named\n\n26:36.800 --> 26:45.400\nJason, I'm a cat person too, you feel like a cat to me, I asked him to come up the stage,\n\n26:45.400 --> 26:53.280\nhe did so unwillingly, he's neither David Spade nor is he Roberto Bonini, he's right\n\n26:53.280 --> 26:57.640\nin the middle, he just glares at you and if you have some kibble in your hand he'll eat\n\n26:57.640 --> 27:04.720\nit, I love it, I don't know, I just wanted to say I love you, it's hard for our kind\n\n27:04.720 --> 27:13.400\nto express love to each other, the Dungeons and Dragons people, it's true yeah, do you\n\n27:13.400 --> 27:24.200\nlove me, yeah I love you, I was just thinking that there should be a universal symbol of\n\n27:24.200 --> 27:28.400\njust like acknowledgement and benevolence that we could just express to one another,\n\n27:28.400 --> 27:36.400\nlike if you wanted people to live for a long time but also prosper, if there was a way\n\n27:36.400 --> 27:42.080\nwith maybe a hand signal, something you could do with your fingers, or maybe two fingers\n\n27:42.080 --> 27:47.160\ntouch the other two fingers, just to get down to the logic of it all, you know I agree,\n\n27:47.160 --> 27:53.520\nDan Spencer, you know what it is, it's called a hug, no it's not, no if you're just driving\n\n27:53.520 --> 28:04.520\ndown the street and you see if I sit, hug, hug, hug, ah, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, it's\n\n28:04.520 --> 28:12.040\nlike a Greek wedding, anyways do we derail you or are you going to say something, just\n\n28:12.040 --> 28:18.400\nyeah no, just the hand symbol is cool, yeah, I agree, I think we all agree, it's Harmontown\n\n28:18.400 --> 28:23.840\nor we should be safe too, and in Harmontown the new Yahtzee will be Dungeons and Dragons,\n\n28:23.840 --> 28:32.080\nyou want to set up your stuff and, is it possible to cover the time of you having to unsheath\n\n28:32.080 --> 28:40.080\nyour tomes with a recap of what happened so far, unsheath your tomes.\n\n28:40.080 --> 28:50.200\nThe problem is I have a written down, unsheath your tomes, oh sorry, I don't know, no no,\n\n28:50.200 --> 29:01.640\nfollow your heart, follow your heart, make your books naked to the world, unbind your\n\n29:01.640 --> 29:14.760\npages, flip to the chapter of my heart, you did it, yeah, the television academy agrees,\n\n29:14.760 --> 29:24.600\ngave me an Emmy for Best Original Lyrics once, I don't know if I ever mentioned that, anyways\n\n29:24.600 --> 29:32.000\nwe, for those of you who have never been here before, Jeff and I have embarked on a historic\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:38.800\nnew podcasting experiment, which is we're playing Dungeons and Dragons on our podcast,\n\n29:38.800 --> 29:43.120\nit's probably someone else is doing it, but fuck them, it's podcast dynamite, this guy's\n\n29:43.120 --> 29:46.440\nnodding in the front row, are you doing it on your podcast, is that why you're here?\n\n29:46.440 --> 29:52.600\nNo, but there's a lot of podcasts, all right, well, all right, fine, he said there's a lot\n\n29:52.600 --> 29:58.920\nof podcasts, yeah, of course there is, that makes sense, D&D and porn are probably the\n\n29:58.920 --> 30:05.520\nfirst things to arrive anywhere, there's a new technology, and they're the same people\n\n30:05.520 --> 30:12.720\nasking that question, can we use this to role play while taking a break from jerking off?\n\n30:12.720 --> 30:18.320\nWell, we should ask him, are there pitfalls or the things that we should do or not do?\n\n30:18.320 --> 30:22.760\nWell, that's a good idea, well, let's bring him up here, could you mic him up?\n\n30:22.760 --> 30:28.360\nYou won't be humiliated, share it mic, what's your name, sir?\n\n30:28.360 --> 30:38.320\nMy name's Greg, so Greg, you've seen Dungeons and Dragons played on other podcasts, yes,\n\n30:38.320 --> 30:45.760\nI've listened to it played on other podcasts, so are there, yeah, like Jeff said, are there\n\n30:45.760 --> 30:48.880\nthings that we should avoid?\n\n30:48.880 --> 30:54.960\nGive us some do's and don'ts for podcasting our D&D campaign, like what's the biggest\n\n30:54.960 --> 31:00.880\nmistake you think has ever been made aside from the action itself?\n\n31:00.880 --> 31:12.480\nAlso Greg, also Greg, Greg, take your shirt off, oh geez, okay, I've listened to a lot\n\n31:12.480 --> 31:19.520\nof role-playing game podcasts, they do live D&D games and other stuff, generally I stop\n\n31:19.520 --> 31:23.040\nlistening to them because the people are sort of intolerable, so...\n\n31:23.040 --> 31:29.920\nHow interesting, well if that was going to stop anybody, I'd be dead by now.\n\n31:29.920 --> 31:31.840\nHow do we stay tolerable?\n\n31:31.840 --> 31:37.720\nYeah, expound on that, can you, without making too many enemies?\n\n31:37.720 --> 31:41.200\nHow about this, I'm going to lower your mic.\n\n31:41.200 --> 31:45.480\nWhat makes them intolerable?\n\n31:45.480 --> 31:51.200\nGenerally it's people laughing too much at their own, when they quote Monty Python, nice.\n\n31:51.200 --> 31:55.280\nNo Monty Python quote.\n\n31:55.280 --> 31:58.760\nYeah, that sort of thing, you guys are new enough that you probably don't have any in\n\n31:58.760 --> 32:05.880\njokes from about four campaigns ago, but that's an easy thing to fall into, is in jokes.\n\n32:05.880 --> 32:11.040\nIn jokes are hard, I would suggest maybe keeping it short.\n\n32:11.040 --> 32:13.480\nThat's a good rule with anything.\n\n32:13.480 --> 32:16.600\nI missed the last one, so I don't know how this went last time, but...\n\n32:16.600 --> 32:17.600\nWe didn't keep it short.\n\n32:17.600 --> 32:18.600\nYeah.\n\n32:18.600 --> 32:26.920\nWe fell into your third sand trap, there was a dog leg in the first fairway, ended right\n\n32:26.920 --> 32:27.920\nthere.\n\n32:27.920 --> 32:31.840\nYeah, since I'm on the spot, that did come up in line, while I was there.\n\n32:31.840 --> 32:37.280\nThere's people going, I hope they don't do three chapters of the laser lights with the\n\n32:37.280 --> 32:38.280\nstatues?\n\n32:38.280 --> 32:44.440\nYeah, I mean, having been stuck in mirror puzzle type things myself in D&D games, I would\n\n32:44.440 --> 32:49.840\nsay that if I was the DM, I might lean more towards something which would allow you guys\n\n32:49.840 --> 32:54.440\nto role play and riff off each other, than having to figure something out.\n\n32:54.440 --> 32:55.440\nRight.\n\n32:55.440 --> 32:56.440\nAll right.\n\n32:56.440 --> 32:57.440\nGreg.\n\n32:57.440 --> 32:58.440\nGreg, everybody.\n\n32:58.440 --> 32:59.440\nAll right.\n\n32:59.440 --> 33:00.440\nWell done, Greg.\n\n33:00.440 --> 33:01.440\nThank you very much.\n\n33:01.440 --> 33:08.760\nWell, that was a wolf in sheep's clothing, wasn't it?\n\n33:08.760 --> 33:14.760\nNobody expects the Spanish inquisition.\n\n33:14.760 --> 33:21.560\nI'm sorry, I couldn't help myself.\n\n33:21.560 --> 33:25.960\nSpencer, catch the audience up and catch us up.\n\n33:25.960 --> 33:28.520\nWhere did we leave off last time in our campaign?\n\n33:28.520 --> 33:31.840\nAll right, well, I should say, I was just testing the audience.\n\n33:31.840 --> 33:32.960\nI do have dice.\n\n33:32.960 --> 33:37.760\nI'm really disappointed in all of you.\n\n33:37.760 --> 33:39.040\nHe had actual dice.\n\n33:39.040 --> 33:41.520\nHe pretended to lose them to see who would have dice.\n\n33:41.520 --> 33:45.600\nOh, you were just a clever pawn in my game, Jeff.\n\n33:45.600 --> 33:49.520\nWell, that's a dungeon master.\n\n33:49.520 --> 33:52.320\nAlso, that's a liar.\n\n33:52.320 --> 33:55.400\nHe's a mastermind.\n\n33:55.400 --> 33:56.400\nAll right.\n\n33:56.400 --> 33:58.360\nYou've got, you have your 20 side?\n\n33:58.360 --> 33:59.360\nYeah.\n\n33:59.360 --> 34:00.360\nYeah, I got it all.\n\n34:00.360 --> 34:01.360\nYou son of a bitch.\n\n34:01.360 --> 34:03.360\nDon't underestimate him.\n\n34:03.360 --> 34:04.360\nAll right.\n\n34:04.360 --> 34:07.520\nOr trust him.\n\n34:07.520 --> 34:10.440\nDon't do either.\n\n34:10.440 --> 34:15.560\nThese are the chronicles of Sharpie and Quark, heroes whose names are etched into the very\n\n34:15.560 --> 34:21.280\nwalls of fate itself, who made destiny their bitch.\n\n34:21.280 --> 34:26.120\nOur heroes were last seen hacking goblins to pieces and rearranging mirrors deep in the\n\n34:26.120 --> 34:27.640\nbowels of the trove.\n\n34:27.640 --> 34:31.920\nYou are in the dark passage of a small cave, but you can see that it opens up into a great\n\n34:31.920 --> 34:32.920\ncavern.\n\n34:32.920 --> 34:37.520\nA pit stretches out before you, but you can see a rickety old bridge bridging the gap.\n\n34:37.520 --> 34:39.840\nOh, let's cross that bridge.\n\n34:39.840 --> 34:43.160\nYeah, I mean, if it was going to break, it would have broken by now.\n\n34:43.160 --> 34:44.160\nRight.\n\n34:44.160 --> 34:50.080\nI should warn you, across the cavern lies an enormous white pig wallowing in a glimmering\n\n34:50.080 --> 34:51.680\npile of treasure.\n\n34:51.680 --> 34:54.440\nWait, he's underneath the bridge?\n\n34:54.440 --> 34:56.840\nHe's across the bridge.\n\n34:56.840 --> 35:00.280\nAnd if we cross that bridge, there's a white pig with some treasure?\n\n35:00.280 --> 35:01.280\nYep.\n\n35:01.280 --> 35:03.000\nA living pig?\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:04.600\nIt's a gigantic pig.\n\n35:04.600 --> 35:06.000\nA white pig?\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:07.720\nA white and albino pig.\n\n35:07.720 --> 35:09.880\nYou can see it.\n\n35:09.880 --> 35:12.400\nI have a plus seven against albino pigs.\n\n35:12.400 --> 35:14.240\nI'm making that up.\n\n35:14.240 --> 35:15.920\nHe's making it up.\n\n35:15.920 --> 35:17.400\nAll right.\n\n35:17.400 --> 35:20.960\nWell, rickety bridge worries me.\n\n35:20.960 --> 35:21.960\nWell, okay.\n\n35:21.960 --> 35:22.960\nBut like I...\n\n35:22.960 --> 35:23.960\nCraig, any ideas?\n\n35:23.960 --> 35:24.960\nYeah.\n\n35:24.960 --> 35:27.320\nYeah, I didn't think so.\n\n35:27.320 --> 35:31.120\nIt's just, yeah, it's fucking scary.\n\n35:31.120 --> 35:34.400\nGot a rickety bridge, albino pig.\n\n35:34.400 --> 35:36.400\nI want that treasure, Herman.\n\n35:36.400 --> 35:37.760\nI want that pig.\n\n35:37.760 --> 35:42.120\nI want that treasure sharpie butthole up.\n\n35:42.120 --> 35:44.600\nI call out to the pig.\n\n35:44.600 --> 35:46.680\nIt doesn't seem to see you.\n\n35:46.680 --> 35:48.480\nIt's interest in wallowing in treasure.\n\n35:48.480 --> 35:54.000\nI think it's an illusion, but the odd thing is, it's mocking us.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.240\nI think it's saying, hey, look, you're pigs, right?\n\n35:56.240 --> 35:57.240\nYou want treasure.\n\n35:57.240 --> 36:01.280\nMaybe because of my small size, can I get across that bridge without any trouble?\n\n36:01.280 --> 36:03.240\nYou can definitely try to sneak across the bridge.\n\n36:03.240 --> 36:06.000\nI'm going to sneak across that bridge, Spencer.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:07.000\nAll right.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nI'm rolling the dice.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:10.000\nUh-oh.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:11.000\nAll right.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:15.520\nYou managed to cross the bridge, but you hear a couple creaks.\n\n36:15.520 --> 36:16.640\nBut I'm across it?\n\n36:16.640 --> 36:17.720\nYou are across it.\n\n36:17.720 --> 36:22.880\nSo I probably worried about that fat ass sharpie butthole out getting across it.\n\n36:22.880 --> 36:25.320\nI'm not fat, I'm just not deformed.\n\n36:25.320 --> 36:30.600\nI'm sorry, I'm a little people.\n\n36:30.600 --> 36:35.960\nHey, sharpie, get over here, it's great.\n\n36:35.960 --> 36:41.520\nI heard creaks, fucker.\n\n36:41.520 --> 36:44.960\nCheck out the pig.\n\n36:44.960 --> 36:46.480\nI check out the pig.\n\n36:46.480 --> 36:48.920\nThe pig is wallowing in treasure.\n\n36:48.920 --> 36:51.800\nIt stands a good 10 feet tall at the shoulder.\n\n36:51.800 --> 36:54.680\nHis eyes gleam yellow like topaz jewels.\n\n36:54.680 --> 36:55.680\nCan I attack this pig?\n\n36:55.680 --> 36:56.680\nYou are far off.\n\n36:56.680 --> 36:57.880\nYou're about 30 feet away.\n\n36:57.880 --> 36:58.880\nYou'd have to charge it.\n\n36:58.880 --> 37:01.880\nI'm going to charge a pig.\n\n37:01.880 --> 37:06.480\nI didn't come this far to not charge pigs.\n\n37:06.480 --> 37:08.800\nI'm a barbarian gnome.\n\n37:08.800 --> 37:12.640\nI come from a long line of pig chargers.\n\n37:12.640 --> 37:15.880\nLeaving sharpie across on the other side of the bridge, you draw your sword and charge\n\n37:15.880 --> 37:17.380\ntowards the pig.\n\n37:17.380 --> 37:20.440\nIt stands up in anticipation of your coming strike.\n\n37:20.440 --> 37:25.360\nAs you see it, you notice a few gold coins fall from its mouth.\n\n37:25.360 --> 37:27.960\nYou swing at the pig.\n\n37:27.960 --> 37:29.960\nIt's a treasure eating pig.\n\n37:29.960 --> 37:30.960\nYou miss.\n\n37:30.960 --> 37:31.960\nUh oh.\n\n37:31.960 --> 37:32.960\nOh shit.\n\n37:32.960 --> 37:36.320\nYour blade glances harmly off the pig's skin.\n\n37:36.320 --> 37:37.800\nYou hear a sharp tink.\n\n37:37.800 --> 37:38.800\nUh oh.\n\n37:38.800 --> 37:43.040\nI'm telling you, it's like some kind of golem or something.\n\n37:43.040 --> 37:45.360\nI got to get over there and help my little semi-friend.\n\n37:45.360 --> 37:48.000\nJust cross the bridge.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:49.000\nJackass.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:53.880\nI'm getting my ass kicked by an albino pig over here.\n\n37:53.880 --> 37:59.600\nI remember from my history that I cast Featherfall on myself to get out of that tower I was kept\n\n37:59.600 --> 38:00.600\nprison in.\n\n38:00.600 --> 38:01.600\nUh huh.\n\n38:01.600 --> 38:02.600\nSo I assume that's one of my spells.\n\n38:02.600 --> 38:05.400\nYou've forgotten it.\n\n38:05.400 --> 38:14.640\nHow convenient.\n\n38:14.640 --> 38:17.200\nThe pig poises, ready to strike at your friend.\n\n38:17.200 --> 38:26.200\nAlright, I bound across the bridge by the way, planting my full weight on each footfall.\n\n38:26.200 --> 38:31.040\nWith ease you cross the bridge, relatively few strides.\n\n38:31.040 --> 38:34.800\nYou're across the bridge.\n\n38:34.800 --> 38:37.560\nNow you can like attack or cast a spell.\n\n38:37.560 --> 38:38.560\nOr do nothing.\n\n38:38.560 --> 38:39.560\nEven wait.\n\n38:39.560 --> 38:40.560\nAlright.\n\n38:40.560 --> 38:41.560\nCan I attack again?\n\n38:41.560 --> 38:45.120\nIt's his turn that would be the pig's turn then yours.\n\n38:45.120 --> 38:50.200\nDoes sleep work on potentially inanimate pigs?\n\n38:50.200 --> 38:53.760\nYou can certainly try it.\n\n38:53.760 --> 38:55.120\nI didn't learn anything about it.\n\n38:55.120 --> 38:59.880\nIn wizard school you learned that if this was in fact some sort of construct pig it\n\n38:59.880 --> 39:02.320\nwouldn't work, but if it was a living pig it probably would.\n\n39:02.320 --> 39:03.320\nRight.\n\n39:03.320 --> 39:06.600\nBut living pigs are usually not ten feet tall.\n\n39:06.600 --> 39:11.600\nConstruct pig.\n\n39:11.600 --> 39:13.720\nRay of Frost.\n\n39:13.720 --> 39:20.600\nYou cast Ray of Frost, a blue beam shoots towards the pig.\n\n39:20.600 --> 39:25.480\nThe beam connects squarely in the face of the pig.\n\n39:25.480 --> 39:26.480\nFuck yeah.\n\n39:26.480 --> 39:27.480\nSee I'm not useless.\n\n39:27.480 --> 39:28.480\nYeah.\n\n39:28.480 --> 39:29.960\nTook you long enough to get across that bridge.\n\n39:29.960 --> 39:32.160\nHe takes two damage of cold.\n\n39:32.160 --> 39:38.560\nLet's hope it's a first level giant white pig.\n\n39:38.560 --> 39:46.720\nThe pig reacting to the beam hitting it in the face rears up and brings its feet down\n\n39:46.720 --> 39:47.720\non Jeff.\n\n39:47.720 --> 39:48.720\nI can't talk.\n\n39:48.720 --> 39:49.720\nQuark.\n\n39:49.720 --> 39:50.720\nYeah.\n\n39:50.720 --> 39:51.720\nQuark.\n\n39:51.720 --> 39:52.720\nAm I okay?\n\n39:52.720 --> 39:53.720\nLet's see.\n\n39:53.720 --> 39:54.720\nUh oh.\n\n39:54.720 --> 39:56.920\nWhat's your armor class?\n\n39:56.920 --> 39:57.920\n17.\n\n39:57.920 --> 39:58.920\n17.\n\n39:58.920 --> 40:00.760\nGive it to me straight Spencer.\n\n40:00.760 --> 40:02.760\nHow am I?\n\n40:02.760 --> 40:05.040\nI got a ten foot fake pig on me.\n\n40:05.040 --> 40:11.120\nThe pig foot lands on your chest but the armor manages to protect you.\n\n40:11.120 --> 40:13.160\nYou are on the floor but unharmed.\n\n40:13.160 --> 40:14.160\nSweet.\n\n40:14.160 --> 40:19.000\nAll right now go so you're on the floor so you can get up probably.\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:20.000\nI'm gonna get up.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:21.000\nI get up.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.400\nYou leap to your feet.\n\n40:23.400 --> 40:29.160\nI run behind my friend.\n\n40:29.160 --> 40:33.960\nHigh tailing it away you attempt to outrun the pig but the pig makes a swipe at your\n\n40:33.960 --> 40:34.960\nback.\n\n40:34.960 --> 40:35.960\nOh shit.\n\n40:35.960 --> 40:38.120\nI had my chance.\n\n40:38.120 --> 40:41.400\nMuch like the first blow this one manages to avoid hitting you.\n\n40:41.400 --> 40:42.400\nAll right.\n\n40:42.400 --> 40:43.400\nYou escape safely.\n\n40:43.400 --> 40:45.160\nI do have a giant sword don't I?\n\n40:45.160 --> 40:46.160\nYes.\n\n40:46.160 --> 40:48.080\nI would attack that pig one more time.\n\n40:48.080 --> 40:54.800\nAll right you whirl around and slash the pig in the face.\n\n40:54.800 --> 40:56.800\nYou connect with the pig's face.\n\n40:56.800 --> 41:00.600\nA crack appears right across its nose.\n\n41:00.600 --> 41:09.400\nWe'll be right back.\n\n41:09.400 --> 41:10.400\nIs it my turn?\n\n41:10.400 --> 41:11.400\nYou can go ahead.\n\n41:11.400 --> 41:12.400\nYes.\n\n41:12.400 --> 41:16.000\nI have to ask you a quick question as a dungeon master.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:17.000\nYeah any questions.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:21.000\nI have a list of spells here and then I have check marks on some of those spells.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.520\nYou can cast the ones with check marks right now.\n\n41:23.520 --> 41:24.880\nLater you can change them.\n\n41:24.880 --> 41:25.880\nOops.\n\n41:25.880 --> 41:26.880\nOkay.\n\n41:26.880 --> 41:28.880\nOh boy.\n\n41:28.880 --> 41:29.880\nMagic missile.\n\n41:29.880 --> 41:32.560\nYou cast magic missile on the pig.\n\n41:32.560 --> 41:36.880\nA blinding sphere of light shoots forth from your palms and strikes the pig right in its\n\n41:36.880 --> 41:37.880\nleg.\n\n41:37.880 --> 41:38.880\nLeg.\n\n41:38.880 --> 41:39.880\nLet me get a dice.\n\n41:39.880 --> 41:40.880\nAim for the face.\n\n41:40.880 --> 41:41.880\nA dude.\n\n41:41.880 --> 41:49.640\nI'm into the arcane arts.\n\n41:49.640 --> 41:51.160\nYou hit it for four damage.\n\n41:51.160 --> 41:52.160\nSee?\n\n41:52.160 --> 41:55.480\nThat's like twice as much as your sword by the way.\n\n41:55.480 --> 41:58.880\nI didn't say out loud the sword did seven damage.\n\n41:58.880 --> 41:59.880\nOh.\n\n41:59.880 --> 42:00.880\nSorry.\n\n42:00.880 --> 42:04.360\nTwice as much as my ray of frost.\n\n42:04.360 --> 42:08.760\nI'm getting better.\n\n42:08.760 --> 42:13.160\nYour arcane magic missile strikes the pig.\n\n42:13.160 --> 42:14.160\nIt is angry.\n\n42:14.160 --> 42:17.280\nIt charges you Sharpie.\n\n42:17.280 --> 42:20.160\nIt's barreling right towards you.\n\n42:20.160 --> 42:23.560\nLet's see if it connects.\n\n42:23.560 --> 42:25.120\nThe pig plows right into you.\n\n42:25.120 --> 42:27.320\nIt knocks you up in the air.\n\n42:27.320 --> 42:30.520\nWhen you land flat on your back, sprawled out.\n\n42:30.520 --> 42:33.360\nYou can go ahead, Jeff.\n\n42:33.360 --> 42:35.840\nI want to kill this pig.\n\n42:35.840 --> 42:43.320\nHow does just a regular gnome barbarian like me kill a fake construct albino pig?\n\n42:43.320 --> 42:45.520\nCan I swipe at it again?\n\n42:45.520 --> 42:47.520\nCan you fly into a berserker rage?\n\n42:47.520 --> 42:48.520\nBerserk rage.\n\n42:48.520 --> 42:49.520\nI go into a rage.\n\n42:49.520 --> 42:51.440\nYou fly into a rage.\n\n42:51.440 --> 42:55.840\nAs your eyes turn red, the muscles on your body bulge and ripple.\n\n42:55.840 --> 42:57.520\nPeace in size.\n\n42:57.520 --> 43:00.040\nGet a room.\n\n43:00.040 --> 43:02.760\nYou lose all capacity to listen to logic and reason.\n\n43:02.760 --> 43:04.440\nYou can only take violent actions.\n\n43:04.440 --> 43:07.280\nLet's do this thing.\n\n43:07.280 --> 43:08.280\nYou fly at the pig.\n\n43:08.280 --> 43:09.280\nI'm going to kill a pig.\n\n43:09.280 --> 43:11.560\nSlashing it across the side with your blade.\n\n43:11.560 --> 43:14.560\nGive me 20.\n\n43:14.560 --> 43:15.560\nYou got a 17.\n\n43:15.560 --> 43:16.560\nThat's pretty close.\n\n43:16.560 --> 43:17.560\nOh, that's not bad.\n\n43:17.560 --> 43:19.800\nYou strike the pig on its flank.\n\n43:19.800 --> 43:23.120\nIts side splits open and several coins fall out.\n\n43:23.120 --> 43:27.160\nIt's still on some of its last legs.\n\n43:27.160 --> 43:28.160\nIt's a piggy bank.\n\n43:28.160 --> 43:31.160\nI just got that.\n\n43:31.160 --> 43:35.480\nI just got that.\n\n43:35.480 --> 43:39.240\nI can't hear logic right now.\n\n43:39.240 --> 43:42.640\nI say that aloud.\n\n43:42.640 --> 43:45.920\nYou're talking to a crazy person right now.\n\n43:45.920 --> 43:49.600\nI'm attacking a pig.\n\n43:49.600 --> 43:50.600\nHave I...\n\n43:50.600 --> 43:51.600\nHey, Dan.\n\n43:51.600 --> 43:53.480\nIs there a cork out of its belly?\n\n43:53.480 --> 43:55.840\nIs there a cork in its belly?\n\n43:55.840 --> 43:57.840\nI examined the pig.\n\n43:57.840 --> 43:59.200\nGood job there.\n\n43:59.200 --> 44:00.200\nYou examined the pig.\n\n44:00.200 --> 44:01.200\nGood Jew.\n\n44:01.200 --> 44:02.960\nYeah, good Jew.\n\n44:02.960 --> 44:08.520\nThe enemy of the pig.\n\n44:08.520 --> 44:11.440\nHere we go.\n\n44:11.440 --> 44:18.080\nYou do notice on its underbelly is a faint line indicating maybe some sort of seam.\n\n44:18.080 --> 44:19.080\nCome on.\n\n44:19.080 --> 44:20.080\nIt's a piggy bank.\n\n44:20.080 --> 44:21.080\nYeah.\n\n44:21.080 --> 44:22.080\nRight.\n\n44:22.080 --> 44:28.560\nIs there a little hammer I can get a hold of?\n\n44:28.560 --> 44:29.560\nCrack it.\n\n44:29.560 --> 44:32.720\nYou can see some large lorox flying on the ground.\n\n44:32.720 --> 44:39.680\nI shout out to my non-logical, hateful friend.\n\n44:39.680 --> 44:40.680\nThe belly.\n\n44:40.680 --> 44:45.160\nThere's a seam on its belly.\n\n44:45.160 --> 44:47.440\nTarget the belly.\n\n44:47.440 --> 44:50.880\nYour shout rings out and he barely can manage to register it.\n\n44:50.880 --> 44:57.880\nYou're not sure if he understood your full meaning.\n\n44:57.880 --> 45:01.680\nOkay.\n\n45:01.680 --> 45:04.600\nI grab a rock and I attack the pig's belly with a rock.\n\n45:04.600 --> 45:08.560\nYou grab a sizable boulder and smash it into the side of the pig.\n\n45:08.560 --> 45:09.960\nIt shatters into pieces.\n\n45:09.960 --> 45:10.960\nSweet.\n\n45:10.960 --> 45:11.960\nIt's full of treasure.\n\n45:11.960 --> 45:12.960\nThe whole pig?\n\n45:12.960 --> 45:14.600\nThe whole pig is destroyed.\n\n45:14.600 --> 45:15.600\nWe beat the giant piggy bank.\n\n45:15.600 --> 45:16.600\nWe beat the piggy bank.\n\n45:16.600 --> 45:26.040\nThe whole thing was a piggy bank?\n\n45:26.040 --> 45:32.240\nBeating the giant piggy bank was a metaphor or something?\n\n45:32.240 --> 45:36.160\nIt's for your destroyed innocence as adventurers.\n\n45:36.160 --> 45:39.600\nI just made that up right this second.\n\n45:39.600 --> 45:44.680\nLet's collect this treasure and wrap this segment up.\n\n45:44.680 --> 45:48.440\nYou count 3,500 gold pieces in coins.\n\n45:48.440 --> 45:49.680\nJesus Christ.\n\n45:49.680 --> 45:54.080\nA few gems were recovered but you don't know their true values.\n\n45:54.080 --> 45:58.760\nYou see a large, no, a small jade statue of a lion.\n\n45:58.760 --> 46:00.760\nIt seems to be glowing softly.\n\n46:00.760 --> 46:02.440\nIt looks rather heavy.\n\n46:02.440 --> 46:05.240\nAs well as a box.\n\n46:05.240 --> 46:07.880\nA wooden box.\n\n46:07.880 --> 46:10.920\nLet's put that jade lion in the box.\n\n46:10.920 --> 46:14.160\nThe lion does not fit in the box.\n\n46:14.160 --> 46:16.240\nHe don't fit in the box.\n\n46:16.240 --> 46:17.240\nDon't be defensive.\n\n46:17.240 --> 46:18.240\nCalm down.\n\n46:18.240 --> 46:21.360\nStop trying to do logical things.\n\n46:21.360 --> 46:22.360\nMy eyes are still red.\n\n46:22.360 --> 46:23.360\nI'm sorry.\n\n46:23.360 --> 46:25.960\nYou're starting to come down.\n\n46:25.960 --> 46:26.960\nTake it easy.\n\n46:26.960 --> 46:31.560\nFor future reference, don't just open boxes we find in treasure piles.\n\n46:31.560 --> 46:33.040\nOr do.\n\n46:33.040 --> 46:34.040\nOpen that box.\n\n46:34.040 --> 46:35.040\nOr don't.\n\n46:35.040 --> 46:36.040\nI'm going to open that box.\n\n46:36.040 --> 46:37.040\nI'm still illogical.\n\n46:37.040 --> 46:38.040\nI open the box.\n\n46:38.040 --> 46:39.760\nIt's full of scrolls.\n\n46:39.760 --> 46:42.520\nYou don't understand.\n\n46:42.520 --> 46:43.520\nThose are mine.\n\n46:43.520 --> 46:48.240\nThat's obviously literati stuff.\n\n46:48.240 --> 46:53.520\nUsing your wizard eyes you can tell that there are two scrolls of magic missile and two scrolls\n\n46:53.520 --> 46:54.520\nof burning hands.\n\n46:54.520 --> 46:55.520\nNice.\n\n46:55.520 --> 46:57.040\nI'll take them.\n\n46:57.040 --> 47:00.280\nYou also see a large gold sword.\n\n47:00.280 --> 47:03.240\nI'll be having that sword.\n\n47:03.240 --> 47:06.360\nAs you reach through the sword, you notice a warmth in the grip.\n\n47:06.360 --> 47:11.480\nYou hold it aloft and it emanates bright light.\n\n47:11.480 --> 47:15.640\nWe're talking about jerking off, right?\n\n47:15.640 --> 47:17.160\nWhat's going on over there, Quirk?\n\n47:17.160 --> 47:19.720\nI'm just grabbing a warm sword handle.\n\n47:19.720 --> 47:23.240\nWhy is it warm?\n\n47:23.240 --> 47:25.360\nI don't know.\n\n47:25.360 --> 47:26.360\nYou tell me.\n\n47:26.360 --> 47:29.400\nIs it just warm as he grabs it or is it?\n\n47:29.400 --> 47:30.400\nIt's magic.\n\n47:30.400 --> 47:32.000\nIt's just generally warm.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.520\nCan I investigate the sword?\n\n47:34.520 --> 47:37.000\nYou investigate the sword.\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:41.680\nThis blade is a bronzy gold color and it has runes that you don't understand etched into\n\n47:41.680 --> 47:42.680\nthem.\n\n47:42.680 --> 47:44.960\nThe handle is bound in green leather.\n\n47:44.960 --> 47:47.000\nHere's my vote.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:50.400\nWe gather all this shit up best we can.\n\n47:50.400 --> 47:51.400\nTake five.\n\n47:51.400 --> 47:53.400\nYeah, take it back to town.\n\n47:53.400 --> 47:57.200\nWe make Spencer do the grub work of adding this stuff to our inventory so that we can\n\n47:57.200 --> 47:59.680\nanalyze it in another installment.\n\n47:59.680 --> 48:01.680\nLook, a full day's work.\n\n48:01.680 --> 48:02.680\nWe crossed a bridge.\n\n48:02.680 --> 48:03.680\nAnother day?\n\n48:03.680 --> 48:05.680\nAnother 3,500 gold days.\n\n48:05.680 --> 48:09.000\nWe killed the giant piggy bank.\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:10.000\nSpencer, everybody.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:11.000\nSpencer!\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:25.680\nAll right, Quirk, Greg, let's go to our Judges and Dragons segment, Judge Greg.\n\n48:25.680 --> 48:26.680\nOur man on the street.\n\n48:26.680 --> 48:30.920\nAnd see how that compared to his vast compendium.\n\n48:30.920 --> 48:34.400\nGreg, what'd you think?\n\n48:34.400 --> 48:35.800\nThat was really good.\n\n48:35.800 --> 48:37.920\nI give Spencer props.\n\n48:37.920 --> 48:39.720\nIt must be really hard.\n\n48:39.720 --> 48:44.400\nThe whole time I was looking over him and just wondering how he could not freak out.\n\n48:44.400 --> 48:46.400\nAll right.\n\n48:46.400 --> 48:49.400\nAll right.\n\n48:49.400 --> 48:52.280\nIt seemed like props.\n\n48:52.280 --> 48:56.520\nThen again, in my early stand-up days, when you wanted to fuck somebody over, if you were\n\n48:56.520 --> 48:59.320\nMC, you would come up after them and go, keep it going, folks.\n\n48:59.320 --> 49:04.240\nComedy isn't easy.\n\n49:04.240 --> 49:06.600\nBut I don't think that was the spirit in which that was offered.\n\n49:06.600 --> 49:07.600\nYou liked it, right?\n\n49:07.600 --> 49:08.600\nNo, he liked it.\n\n49:08.600 --> 49:09.600\nThat was sincere.\n\n49:09.600 --> 49:15.240\nDo you have any advice for us, like things to do or not do next time?\n\n49:15.240 --> 49:18.400\nNo, I can't.\n\n49:18.400 --> 49:19.400\nI got nothing.\n\n49:19.400 --> 49:20.400\nYou were thrilled.\n\n49:20.400 --> 49:21.400\nI'm thrilled.\n\n49:21.400 --> 49:22.400\nYou were entertained.\n\n49:22.400 --> 49:23.400\nFantastic.\n\n49:23.400 --> 49:24.400\nWe did it.\n\n49:24.400 --> 49:25.400\nIt was good.\n\n49:25.400 --> 49:26.400\nWe had a good, we had a good, we had a good.\n\n49:26.400 --> 49:27.400\nAnybody else out there have any questions?\n\n49:27.400 --> 49:28.400\nYes, ma'am, right there?\n\n49:28.400 --> 49:30.400\nExamine before you fight.\n\n49:30.400 --> 49:34.800\nA young lady in the crowd says, examine before you fight.\n\n49:34.800 --> 49:38.000\nLook, I'm a barbarian gnome.\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:42.400\nIf I examined before I fought, I'd be taller.\n\n49:42.400 --> 49:43.400\nAll right.\n\n49:43.400 --> 49:44.400\nThat's good advice.\n\n49:44.400 --> 49:45.800\nWhat's your name, ma'am?\n\n49:45.800 --> 49:46.800\nJen.\n\n49:46.800 --> 49:47.800\nJen says examine before you fight.\n\n49:47.800 --> 49:50.800\nLet's try to hear her ethereal voice next time we enter a battle.\n\n49:50.800 --> 49:51.800\nExamine.\n\n49:51.800 --> 49:53.920\nYou should always examine before you fight, gentlemen.\n\n49:53.920 --> 49:59.680\nI will say in my defense, Jen, I didn't know we were in a battle until my friend charged\n\n49:59.680 --> 50:04.720\nacross the bridge and attacked the pig.\n\n50:04.720 --> 50:08.440\nWhen I see a pig, I don't think time to fight.\n\n50:08.440 --> 50:12.600\nI think time for breakfast or a delightful Disney conversation.\n\n50:12.600 --> 50:14.680\nThe last thing I thought was that we're going to be fighting it.\n\n50:14.680 --> 50:17.960\nI sent him across the bridge to test it because he's lighter.\n\n50:17.960 --> 50:18.960\nRight.\n\n50:18.960 --> 50:19.960\nI win, Jeff.\n\n50:19.960 --> 50:20.960\nAll right.\n\n50:20.960 --> 50:21.960\nYou blame me?\n\n50:21.960 --> 50:22.960\nYeah.\n\n50:22.960 --> 50:23.960\nWell, I'll take it.\n\n50:23.960 --> 50:25.960\nHave you played D&D before?\n\n50:25.960 --> 50:26.960\nNo.\n\n50:26.960 --> 50:27.960\nNo.\n\n50:27.960 --> 50:29.960\nThis is life lessons.\n\n50:29.960 --> 50:31.960\nThis is life lessons.\n\n50:31.960 --> 50:32.960\nExamine before you fight.\n\n50:32.960 --> 50:33.960\nExamine?\n\n50:33.960 --> 50:36.160\nThat should be written in Latin on the Harmontown flag.\n\n50:36.160 --> 50:38.160\nExamine before you fight.\n\n50:38.160 --> 50:39.160\nPick your battles.\n\n50:39.160 --> 50:40.160\nThank you.\n\n50:40.160 --> 50:43.160\nThank you very much.\n\n50:43.160 --> 50:46.920\nI want to hear a little bit about your trip to Chicago.\n\n50:46.920 --> 50:52.280\nAaron gave me a couple of little nuggets about the clientele at the Hugo Awards.\n\n50:52.280 --> 50:54.880\nCan I hear a little bit about that?\n\n50:54.880 --> 50:56.480\nIt was very interesting.\n\n50:56.480 --> 51:05.440\nI'll tell you, the Hugo Awards, both at the pre-reception, explain to everybody what the\n\n51:05.440 --> 51:06.440\nHugo Awards are.\n\n51:06.440 --> 51:07.440\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n51:07.440 --> 51:11.120\nIt's the Hugo Awards are the science fiction awards.\n\n51:11.120 --> 51:15.280\nBut we were nominated for one for the Community Episode Remedial Chaos Theory, which involved\n\n51:15.280 --> 51:20.880\nmultiple timelines and technically qualified as science fiction, I guess, because it asks\n\n51:20.880 --> 51:24.880\nthe question, what if, which is how I would define sci-fi.\n\n51:24.880 --> 51:29.600\nWe were honored, and Chris McKenna, the writer of the episode, and I went with Chris's brother\n\n51:29.600 --> 51:34.920\nand my girlfriend, Aaron, to Chicago to go to the Hugo Awards ceremony.\n\n51:34.920 --> 51:39.280\nIt was amazing to be back in the Midwest, and specifically to be back in the Midwest\n\n51:39.280 --> 51:43.560\nin a science fiction environment because of the body shapes.\n\n51:43.560 --> 51:52.240\nI have been the fattest guy in Los Angeles for a long time.\n\n51:52.240 --> 52:03.480\nI was like, from Krypton to Earth, like in Wreck-O, I was like, wow, I am hot, and able-bodied.\n\n52:03.480 --> 52:09.480\nLots of rascals, lots of leg braces, lots of scooters, lots of steampunk tanks to help\n\n52:09.480 --> 52:13.600\npeople breathe, goggles, tears.\n\n52:13.600 --> 52:17.520\nThose are called oxygen tanks.\n\n52:17.520 --> 52:19.520\nJust a lot of gimmicks and things.\n\n52:19.520 --> 52:21.080\nIt was very cool.\n\n52:21.080 --> 52:25.040\nThese are my people, after all, and all of you are here just because we moved to LA to\n\n52:25.040 --> 52:27.360\ntry to force our will on the public.\n\n52:27.360 --> 52:32.440\nIt doesn't mean that we are extra sexy or anything, but I like to think that the Harmon\n\n52:32.440 --> 52:38.720\nTown people are nerdy people, and so I was definitely home.\n\n52:38.720 --> 52:45.800\nBut it's just very interesting, like the archetypes, like the rotund women who want\n\n52:45.800 --> 52:50.880\nto dress fancy, nothing is lost on them of the idea of, let's have a big fancy ball,\n\n52:50.880 --> 52:58.160\nbut they all want to do like, well, fancy means Victorian, or like Dragon times.\n\n52:58.160 --> 53:01.400\nSo everyone is kind of like wearing these costumes.\n\n53:01.400 --> 53:06.520\nEverything is as fancy as they can muster, but without buying into the bullshit, like\n\n53:06.520 --> 53:14.080\nblack tie paradigm, so everyone is walking around, it's like Dr. Demento is walking around\n\n53:14.080 --> 53:23.960\ngetting teacakes with women dressed like just Aphrodite, and no music, never.\n\n53:23.960 --> 53:30.760\nFrom the moment we got there to the moment we left, and we left soon because there was\n\n53:30.760 --> 53:35.600\nno music, and we weren't like, we're too cool for this.\n\n53:35.600 --> 53:39.720\nWe got there before the awards show, we were told, show up two hours before the awards\n\n53:39.720 --> 53:42.320\nshow to this reception.\n\n53:42.320 --> 53:45.440\nSo you're in this like banquet hall, no music.\n\n53:45.440 --> 53:49.840\nEverybody like totally cool, they're all good people, they're all clearly like, they've\n\n53:49.840 --> 53:56.760\nall been bullied, and they're all very smart, and they've all dressed to the relative nines.\n\n53:56.760 --> 54:05.440\nAs per their galactic definitions of the nines, they're dressed to the nine kelvins.\n\n54:05.440 --> 54:09.520\nSo like I said, there's like octopi walking around, and that's not true.\n\n54:09.520 --> 54:11.840\nI don't want to conjure that image.\n\n54:11.840 --> 54:15.240\nYou've all been to Comic-Con where there's a storm trip, or this wasn't like that.\n\n54:15.240 --> 54:23.440\nThis was like an eyes wide shut kind of like back room at a real sci-fi convention, you\n\n54:23.440 --> 54:24.440\nknow?\n\n54:24.440 --> 54:30.800\nLike you're not allowed to, like these are like the people that are into sci-fi books,\n\n54:30.800 --> 54:36.840\nand maybe a couple movies if they're really book based.\n\n54:36.840 --> 54:41.520\nThey like the smart stuff, and I think they like fucking.\n\n54:41.520 --> 54:46.720\nIt's like there's a lot of cleavage, a lot of like just taking your boobs and pouring\n\n54:46.720 --> 54:47.720\nthem into things.\n\n54:47.720 --> 54:52.240\nLike Renaissance fair kind of stuff, the Renfaire, there's lots of bodices.\n\n54:52.240 --> 54:56.480\nIt felt a little Renfaire-y, yeah, yeah, like in the sense that it was like, yeah, let's\n\n54:56.480 --> 55:02.040\nbe fancy tonight, but let's not buy into Hugh Jackman's version of fancy.\n\n55:02.040 --> 55:03.040\nDid they embrace you?\n\n55:03.040 --> 55:04.560\nDid they recognize you or know you?\n\n55:04.560 --> 55:10.320\nI think we felt, I'm sure everyone felt this way, but we felt very nerdy, we felt outcast,\n\n55:10.320 --> 55:11.760\nwe felt lonely.\n\n55:11.760 --> 55:13.200\nYou were nerdy at the sci-fi?\n\n55:13.200 --> 55:19.080\nRight, because we were just guys in suits, and so we found a table, like you did in high\n\n55:19.080 --> 55:26.120\nschool, and just found a quiet corner and sat, and then some people like made the effort\n\n55:26.120 --> 55:32.960\nto talk to us, and then we loosened up a little bit, but we felt very like outside and kind\n\n55:32.960 --> 55:33.960\nof off-put.\n\n55:33.960 --> 55:37.040\nAnd for good reason, because I went and we checked in at the convention, the woman that\n\n55:37.040 --> 55:41.000\nchecked us in said, what's your name, and I said, Dan Harmon, and she said, oh, community,\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:44.440\nI love that show, love that episode, I said, oh, thank you very much, I said, you're not\n\n55:44.440 --> 55:45.440\ngoing to win.\n\n55:45.440 --> 55:46.440\nOh, no.\n\n55:46.440 --> 55:47.440\nOh, no.\n\n55:47.440 --> 55:52.000\nShe said, I don't mean any disrespect, but you're up against the doctor's wife, written\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:59.800\nby Neil Gaiman, who is the David Lee Roth of science fiction, apparently.\n\n55:59.800 --> 56:06.120\nAnd this episode was the Panama of Neil Gaiman, thanks, that's up.\n\n56:06.120 --> 56:10.080\nAnd there was just no way we were going to win, and she did me the courtesy of letting\n\n56:10.080 --> 56:14.280\nme know that as I got my name tag, which I appreciate.\n\n56:14.280 --> 56:18.800\nWas there any rehearsal for your interaction with the show?\n\n56:18.800 --> 56:20.680\nYeah, yeah.\n\n56:20.680 --> 56:28.080\nYeah, they asked that we show up early, and I've been involved in other award shows, and\n\n56:28.080 --> 56:29.960\nthis has never happened.\n\n56:29.960 --> 56:36.520\nWe had to show up for an orientation in case we won, which just adds to the humiliation\n\n56:36.520 --> 56:41.720\nof losing, but also it was like a real, it was weird.\n\n56:41.720 --> 56:51.400\nWe walked in, and this woman just, she was like five foot nothing, and she had designed\n\n56:51.400 --> 56:52.400\nthe award.\n\n56:52.400 --> 56:55.480\nOh boy, I don't know how to explain this.\n\n56:55.480 --> 57:03.280\nI want to impart to you guys the misery, so that you can turn it into enjoyment.\n\n57:03.280 --> 57:06.440\nBut I don't know how to do it without making you miserable.\n\n57:06.440 --> 57:11.120\nYou walk in, and you're in the space, and they explain to you how to walk upstairs.\n\n57:11.120 --> 57:17.800\nAnd I guess basically everyone there has Asperger's, every single person.\n\n57:17.800 --> 57:20.920\nThat's what's normal.\n\n57:20.920 --> 57:23.160\nThe attendees or the rest of the audience?\n\n57:23.160 --> 57:28.880\nEvery single person, every security guard, every bartender, every woman that's going\n\n57:28.880 --> 57:34.400\nto hand you a trophy, or the woman that made the trophy, the people voting for the trophies,\n\n57:34.400 --> 57:37.000\neveryone in attendance, everyone has Asperger's.\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:41.440\nIt's just Asperger, Ascon.\n\n57:41.440 --> 57:47.400\nAnd so I walked in, and they, because they were just like, ah, welcome, as it pertains\n\n57:47.400 --> 57:53.400\nto, the obligatory instructions will now proceed.\n\n57:53.400 --> 57:56.600\nYou see the stairs are in the center of the stage.\n\n57:56.600 --> 57:59.760\nIf you win, and should you win, I will not presume that you should win.\n\n57:59.760 --> 58:03.680\nHowever, I should, the condition that you should win, if it was your ex-organ, I suppose\n\n58:03.680 --> 58:04.680\nyou might win.\n\n58:04.680 --> 58:08.480\nIf you do win, please proceed in an orderly fashion, up these stairs in the middle of\n\n58:08.480 --> 58:09.480\nthe stage.\n\n58:09.480 --> 58:13.720\nIf you try to go up the left or right stage, you will instantly break your legs, as there\n\n58:13.720 --> 58:18.080\nare no stairs.\n\n58:18.080 --> 58:21.480\nSo go up the middle, there is an X mark on the stage where you would pause with the\n\n58:21.480 --> 58:22.480\nstatue.\n\n58:22.480 --> 58:26.200\nDo not hold the statue, there are glass wings on the statue, do not hold the mic handles,\n\n58:26.200 --> 58:30.880\nor it will shatter, and that would be a bad thing.\n\n58:30.880 --> 58:31.880\nInvestigate stairs.\n\n58:31.880 --> 58:35.880\nI investigate the stairs, I investigate the stairs.\n\n58:35.880 --> 58:39.440\nThere was a giant pig on the top of the stairs?\n\n58:39.440 --> 58:46.000\nIt was just 40 minutes of people telling you what to do, should someone give you an award.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:58.320\nAnd it turns out what you should do is go up the stairs, take the statue, thank everyone,\n\n58:58.320 --> 59:00.840\nand leave.\n\n59:00.840 --> 59:01.840\nThat's what you should do.\n\n59:01.840 --> 59:05.480\nBut it was just, they Arthur C. Clarked it, man.\n\n59:05.480 --> 59:09.760\nThere was no music during the awards ceremony?\n\n59:09.760 --> 59:10.760\nBack to that.\n\n59:10.760 --> 59:13.960\nSo that was the rehearsal, we had to show up for that, that was the orientation.\n\n59:13.960 --> 59:19.080\nThen we were ushered to the back of the room where the woman who invented the awards, designed\n\n59:19.080 --> 59:23.680\nthem for the last three years, she's the genius that put glass wings on the back of a rocket\n\n59:23.680 --> 59:26.800\nship that you can't hold them by.\n\n59:26.800 --> 59:32.360\nSo it was another 40 minutes of her explaining, don't hold the rocket by the instinctive place\n\n59:32.360 --> 59:37.600\nwhere you would hold it if it was handed to you, and it acted like, instead of an apology,\n\n59:37.600 --> 59:39.000\nit was just like presumption.\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:43.960\nIt was like, hey, fuck you for thinking you should hold this thing in any other way than\n\n59:43.960 --> 59:48.960\nthe prescribed function, and just told you how to mail it back to yourself in a special\n\n59:48.960 --> 59:50.600\nbox if you want it.\n\n59:50.600 --> 59:54.600\nYou did walk out of there thinking two things, fuck, if I don't win this thing I'm going\n\n59:54.600 --> 59:59.720\nto feel like shit, and on the other hand, I just saved myself an asshole to work.\n\n59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.760\nShe showed you how to polish it.\n\n01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:06.400\nShe showed it, and everyone kept saying, because the statue's shaped like a rocket, don't hold\n\n01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.480\nit like a dick, because it looks like a dick.\n\n01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.600\nNo one's just saying that we're a dick, it looks like a dick.\n\n01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.160\nEveryone keeps making jokes about how it looks like a dick, but no one says it looks like\n\n01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160\na dick.\n\n01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.720\nAll the women keep going, oh yeah, they're told it doesn't have to hold it like this,\n\n01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.640\nor clean it like this, or hold it like this, yeah, because it looks like a dick, it looks\n\n01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.080\nlike a big silver dildo.\n\n01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:30.080\nSo own it, or fucking...\n\n01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.080\nOr bone it.\n\n01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:38.960\nYeah, so we got the tutorial about how to clean it, this is a fucking thing that I'll\n\n01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.000\nnever see again in my life, and now I know how to clean it and send it off and mail it\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nto myself.\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nSo you didn't win.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.680\nAs Aaron pointed out, a simple three by three Xerox set of instructions taped to the bottom\n\n01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.120\nof the statue would have sufficed, I think, if you want to get a look on the bottom.\n\n01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:00.360\nOh, here's how I mail this back to LA, but we went through a lot of that stuff, then\n\n01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.880\nwe went to the reception.\n\n01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.080\nNo music, no fucking music.\n\n01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.680\nWas there music when people accepted the award?\n\n01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680\nNo.\n\n01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.680\nThey didn't play them on?\n\n01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.320\nNo, I'm telling you, I'm taking you through this chapter by chapter, there's three chapters\n\n01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:21.960\nto an award show, the reception, the award show itself, and then the post-afterparty.\n\n01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.600\nNo music at either of those things at any point.\n\n01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.680\nImagine an award show, first of all, imagine a reception, where everyone's just eating\n\n01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.880\ntea cakes and going like, hey, what are you nominated for?\n\n01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:36.600\nI don't know, no music, you're just standing in a room, and then they all go, everyone,\n\n01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.600\ncome in here, come into this room, and then you go into the room, and then they go, it's\n\n01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.600\ntime for the awards.\n\n01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.600\nNo, it should have been.\n\n01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:43.600\nSilence.\n\n01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.600\nIt should have been.\n\n01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.600\nIt's a dead man's party.\n\n01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600\nWho could I...\n\n01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:55.480\nIt should have been, like, the greatest adventure, or the theme from Enception, or fucking anything.\n\n01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.000\nLike, what are nerds better at than fucking, like, soundtracks?\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nYou know, yeah.\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.040\nLike, that's what we love.\n\n01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040\nI guess it would...\n\n01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040\nMaybe somebody complained or something.\n\n01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040\nYou know what it was?\n\n01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.680\nI guarantee you, some asked Bergey, and the person was like, the tech is not good tonight,\n\n01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:18.000\nthe speakers are not up to snuff, I will not play my set list with sub-par speakers.\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nGood news and bad news.\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.200\nThe good news is, the sound system is optimized for verbal communication.\n\n01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.880\nThere will be no pops and whistles.\n\n01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:36.040\nThe bad news is, it's basically anti-optimized, or de-optimized, for anything other than it,\n\n01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.400\nwhich happens to include tonight's selection of music, which is provided by Angela, and\n\n01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.160\nI wish she was not consulted about this, and so I don't know what is happening at this\n\n01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.160\npoint in time, so I physically don't know what to do.\n\n01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.840\nAll right, Stephen, well, I guess no music then.\n\n01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.680\nOr someone just forgot to play music, because that happens a lot.\n\n01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.000\nI was thinking that somebody complained the previous year, and they were like, I don't\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.520\nunderstand why there's music playing, you know, like, some music offended them or something.\n\n01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.440\nYour Ben Folds 5 seems to be running contrary to my life.\n\n01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.240\nIt just wasn't logical to play music.\n\n01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:14.240\nAnd so they just stripped it down, so this award ceremony was just a, like the trophy\n\n01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:20.000\nitself, was just a silver dildo, just like a, just a finely shaped thing that could just\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nimpale you.\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.320\nDid anybody make any silver dildo jokes, or was it?\n\n01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.520\nWell, only before and after the show.\n\n01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.520\nNot during the show.\n\n01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.440\nNobody, here's what everyone did, because everyone had been instructed as we were about\n\n01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:36.760\nhow to hold the trophy and how to handle it, and to not make it look like a dick when you\n\n01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.760\nheld it.\n\n01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:43.400\nSo every single person who won an award accepted it from the woman who hands you the award,\n\n01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:48.600\nand then looked at it like a soiled baby and handed it off to someone else.\n\n01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.040\nAre you happy you went, or would you rather have not, not have gone?\n\n01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.040\nI'm very happy I went.\n\n01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:58.840\nI got, I got a 20 minutes of me being a big fucking asshole bully out of it, in my podcast.\n\n01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:04.040\nNo, I don't know, I was happy I went, like I said, I was honored to be there.\n\n01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.960\nBut it was, as I've said, it was my big, big, big chance to lose to Dr. Who instead of Big\n\n01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.960\nBank 30 for a change.\n\n01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.160\nLike, that's a, you know, that's nice, that feels good.\n\n01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.200\nTo rate a sitcom that gets nominated for a sci-fi award, I'm doing something right slash\n\n01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.200\nwrong.\n\n01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.920\nI wanted to be there for that.\n\n01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.880\nYou got two TV deals with two different networks coming up.\n\n01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.880\nThank you.\n\n01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.920\nWas it CBS and Fox, right?\n\n01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.920\nYes.\n\n01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.920\nThank you.\n\n01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.160\nThose probably aren't going to be sci-fi shows.\n\n01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.960\nDo you think you could write a sci-fi show that would compete, like with the likes of\n\n01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.200\nDr. Who and things like that?\n\n01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.200\nDo you think you could do it?\n\n01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.000\nI think probably, because TV, TV's big secret is like, you just have to, all you have to\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.120\ndo is write a good pilot, you hire a bunch of really talented people or just like, you\n\n01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:57.320\nknow, you just farm their sadness.\n\n01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:04.400\nI don't think there's anything that's impossible in TV, because no way, it's the Henry Ford\n\n01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.400\nprinciple.\n\n01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.320\nLike, do you think it's possible to make a jet pack?\n\n01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.320\nYeah.\n\n01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:15.800\nIf you put it of Korean people in a warehouse and starve them to death, yeah.\n\n01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.920\nIf you murder enough people, you know, if you...\n\n01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.920\nThat's the Henry Ford theorem?\n\n01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.920\nYeah.\n\n01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.920\nIf you chain it of human life together and make each person do one small thing, like,\n\n01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.920\nyeah.\n\n01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:28.920\nYou could do anything.\n\n01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.920\nYou're saying you could write a sci-fi show if you put enough Korean people in a warehouse.\n\n01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.920\nYes, yes.\n\n01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.920\nThat's my promise to you tonight.\n\n01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.920\nOn this election eve.\n\n01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.920\nGod, I think...\n\n01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.920\nOrdered by Nike.\n\n01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.920\nWasn't it Archimedes who said, give me enough Korean people?\n\n01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.920\nGive me enough Koreans in a warehouse.\n\n01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.920\nGive me 100 Koreans in one warehouse.\n\n01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.920\nAnd I can write you a...\n\n01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.920\nI will give you a hit UPN show.\n\n01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:57.920\nIf you could write...\n\n01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.920\nAt the top of your head, if you could write a sci-fi show, what would the premise be?\n\n01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.920\nWell, I would either do it...\n\n01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.920\nMy first answer would be time travel in general.\n\n01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.920\nI love time travel.\n\n01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.920\nI'd love to do a time travel show.\n\n01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:10.920\nDo it.\n\n01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:11.920\nFuck you, lady.\n\n01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:12.920\nNo.\n\n01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:13.920\nThat's the...\n\n01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.920\nThat's the investigative before you fire me.\n\n01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920\nOh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.920\nYeah.\n\n01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:21.920\nHey, examine before you yell out, do it.\n\n01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:25.920\nNow, what she really meant, that was a reverse heckle.\n\n01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.920\nThat was a high road heckle.\n\n01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.920\nShe's like, do it.\n\n01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.920\nGet off stage.\n\n01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.920\nGo write something.\n\n01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.920\nThat's why you...\n\n01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.920\nGet us out of here.\n\n01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.920\nI agree with you.\n\n01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.920\nTime travel, I'd love to do.\n\n01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.920\nWhy time travel particularly?\n\n01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.920\nI don't know.\n\n01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.920\nI just think it's...\n\n01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:50.920\nWhat's the wish fulfillment in time travel?\n\n01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.920\nBecause there must be, right?\n\n01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.920\nWell, no, I don't...\n\n01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:55.920\nI don't know.\n\n01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.920\nWhat's the fetish of time travel for you?\n\n01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.920\nWell, no, because you would say...\n\n01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.920\nNo, I think, well, okay, yeah, yeah, empowerment.\n\n01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.920\nThat's what it is.\n\n01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.920\nBecause if I could be...\n\n01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.920\nIf I could go to any time, I would fantasize about like,\n\n01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:14.920\nif my whole garage with all of the stuff that was in my Prius\n\n01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.920\ngot transported to 1920,\n\n01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.920\nthen not only I'd be like, I could be like Batman,\n\n01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.920\nbecause I'd have a Prius.\n\n01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:23.920\nWhat do you have on that Prius?\n\n01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.920\nI'd just be competing with like, machine gun Kelly.\n\n01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.920\nHe'd have like this shitty old car.\n\n01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.920\nAnd a machine gun.\n\n01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.920\nHe'd still kill you.\n\n01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.920\nI know, I know.\n\n01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.920\nI didn't think my fantasy through, Jeff.\n\n01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.920\nBecause I also got like, oh, yeah, I'd have GPS.\n\n01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.920\nNo, I wouldn't.\n\n01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.920\nThe satellites wouldn't be there.\n\n01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.920\nBut I just think it's a cool idea to...\n\n01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920\nYour Prius, yeah.\n\n01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920\nIt wouldn't have the right octane.\n\n01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.920\nYou were talking about just a normal guy in 1920's Chicago.\n\n01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.920\nI think that would be cool.\n\n01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.920\nIf you were like, you had to like dress up in a suit,\n\n01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.920\nand you're like, hey, you know, I don't know.\n\n01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.920\nYeah, wish fulfillment.\n\n01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.920\nThat's everybody's...\n\n01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.920\nYeah, everyone has a time that they'd like to go to.\n\n01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.920\nWe all have the fantasy of going back like,\n\n01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.920\noh fuck, what if I was like, if I knew what I knew now\n\n01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.920\nand could go back to like junior high school.\n\n01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.920\nI'd be the coolest guy in the world.\n\n01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.920\nBut still, I would still be bad at math.\n\n01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.920\nI couldn't save anybody's life.\n\n01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.920\nI'd be bad at all the time in the middle of it.\n\n01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.920\nAlso, you'd be the biggest loser in the world.\n\n01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.920\nLike you would be more honest with girls.\n\n01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.920\nThey would be bigger losers.\n\n01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.920\nThere would be a couple things that you would nail\n\n01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.920\nand then everything else would fall apart\n\n01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.920\nthat ever went together for you.\n\n01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:25.920\nWell, there's your movie.\n\n01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.920\nWell, I think that was called Happy Gilmar.\n\n01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.920\nOr wait, no, what was the other one?\n\n01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:34.920\nHappy Madison, Billy Gilmar, Billy Madison.\n\n01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.920\nI think Adam Sandler was in it.\n\n01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.920\nHe went back to school and he went with his jean jacket\n\n01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.920\nand his ACDC music.\n\n01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.920\nHe found out that you actually wouldn't be cool in high school.\n\n01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.920\nOh yeah, I never saw that.\n\n01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.920\nYeah, because high school is its own culture.\n\n01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.920\nIt's not based on any actual empirical thinking.\n\n01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.920\nIt's based on the hormonal and like in the moment thing\n\n01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:57.920\nof like a bunch of young people.\n\n01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:58.920\nThey're right and we're wrong.\n\n01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.920\nSo Greg, how's Dan doing right now?\n\n01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.920\nAs a podcast.\n\n01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.920\nI have the feeling you're looking for a way to end your podcast.\n\n01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:13.920\nYeah, he's right.\n\n01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.920\nI have a better control.\n\n01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.920\nI would have ended the show right there,\n\n01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.920\nbut I'm not going to do it.\n\n01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.920\nOh, all right.\n\n01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:21.920\nAll right.\n\n01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.920\nLet's figure this out.\n\n01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.920\nDoes anybody have a question?\n\n01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.920\nAnybody like to?\n\n01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.920\nOh yeah, yeah.\n\n01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.920\nRaise your hand.\n\n01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.920\nOkay, there.\n\n01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:33.920\nShout it out.\n\n01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.920\nThank you sponsorship.\n\n01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.920\nHe's calling out for a callback to the Nike sponsorship.\n\n01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.920\nYeah, well, he's talking about, what's your name back there?\n\n01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.920\nDaniel.\n\n01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.920\nDaniel asks what happened to our Nike sponsorship thing.\n\n01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.920\nI think we have to figure out how to do that.\n\n01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.920\nWe were trying to strong arm Nike into giving us money\n\n01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.920\nor actually any sponsor by saying that Nike were terrible people\n\n01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.920\nand then promoting Adidas.\n\n01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.920\nYeah, we should probably hit that real quick.\n\n01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:03.920\nEverybody buy Nike because you're racist.\n\n01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.920\nYes, Nike.\n\n01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:15.920\nThe delicious shoe for the foot of the Aryan nation.\n\n01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.920\nYou know, Dan, while you were talking about Nike\n\n01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.920\nand their overt racism,\n\n01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.920\nI was thinking about how comfortable I am tonight\n\n01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.920\nand my Adidas.\n\n01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:30.920\nIt's a new shoe called the Adidas made by Puma.\n\n01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.920\nIt's the new Puma Adidas.\n\n01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.920\nWe can't fucking do this, right?\n\n01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.920\nWe need to sponsor what we're saying.\n\n01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.920\nWe got all tangled up.\n\n01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.920\nThe answer to your question, Daniel, is we fucked up.\n\n01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.920\nWe tangled in forces.\n\n01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.920\nWe tried to, you know, strong arm Nike,\n\n01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.920\nbut Nike doesn't give a shit.\n\n01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.920\nWe tried to out Avenue Madison Avenue.\n\n01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.920\nYeah, we tried to out Avenue and Avenue.\n\n01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.920\nIt's impossible.\n\n01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.920\nThey're already at Avenue.\n\n01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.920\nI don't care.\n\n01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.920\nI tried to stab a piggy bank earlier.\n\n01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.920\nWe don't fucking know what we're doing.\n\n01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.920\nWelcome to failure.\n\n01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:07.920\nAny other questions?\n\n01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.920\nAnybody have a question for Dan Harmon?\n\n01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:10.920\nRight here, sir.\n\n01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.920\nIs Kettle One your drink of choice,\n\n01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.920\nor is that just for bulk drinking?\n\n01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.920\nIs Kettle One your drink of choice,\n\n01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.920\nor is it just for bulk drinking?\n\n01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.920\nIt's my drink of
