{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:22.000\nI hear music and there's no one there. Smell blossoms and the trees are back. All night long I'm walking on air. I wonder why. I wonder why.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:38.000\nHello everybody, from Hollywood, California, and Meltdown Comics, the Nerdist Theater. Harmon Sound is now in session. Please. Oh shit. Oh my god.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:59.000\nTonight's attendance, 40,000 people. I love it. I love it. I love it. Please welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:09.000\nThank you. What a crowd. I don't know. What is it? I guess it's a million people. What's going on? Is there a convention? I think it's the World Cup. They have World Cup people.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:22.000\nThey heard my World Cup coverage and they're like, okay, well, I'm sure it's unrelated but I was just getting some statistics. Some people like to celebrate this stuff.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:41.000\nI got into podcasting to forget about numbers. I'm fleeing a world too obsessed with ratings and things. I come here to not pay attention to these things. However, Harmontown, but when we went out on tour, I don't know, we used to get like 60,000 to 80,000 downloads per episode.\n\n01:41.000 --> 02:03.000\nNow we're up to like 100,000 per episode. We had a million total when we went on that tour where we made that movie that no one ever gets to see. Now we just passed, I was told in the green room, 10 million downloads total.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:15.000\nBut I'm sure a lot of people download them multiple times. I don't know. I don't know what you kids do. This is for freezes. We don't care. We don't care about no numbers.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:19.000\nI want to talk more about my giant new podium here. This is really exciting.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:34.000\nYeah, just got a new podium. It looks like a 56 Buick. It's got a big light on the front with a logo we'll have to swap out for our own. Yeah, it's pretty great. I like this.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:43.000\nAlright, so what are we going to talk about? I just started doing couples therapy. It's a marriage pre-marriage counseling. You and Rob?\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:49.000\nIt's a long time coming.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:55.000\nNo, Erin and I are, you know, we want to make sure the ship's all airtight before we take it out to the sea.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:58.000\nAm I right in recalling that she called it engagement camp?\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:14.000\nYeah, well, the counselor offers a six week program that she calls marriage camp or something like that. But after our consultation, she's like, I don't know, you know, maybe you guys should do this for a long time.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:19.000\nMaybe not so much a camp as like a condo.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:23.000\nLet's TP more of an asylum. How many have you been to?\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:28.000\nJust one. There was one consultation and then we just had our first one on Friday.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\nTell me, I'm very curious about that.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:52.000\nI'm really, it's really, it's pretty great. I think the most important thing is to have language, because as we all know relationships, the big obstacle for them is that they're competing in their most crucial phases with something that you can't compete with,\n\n03:52.000 --> 04:03.000\nwhich is the courtship phase, where there's hormones, the chemicals pumping through your body, looking at this person across the room, you know, the whole high fidelity monologue with John Cusack.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:16.000\nIt's like, you know, when your, when your lover is a stranger to you and you're, you just love drinking a big glass of water of how you look in their eyes and everything is fantastic.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:25.000\nIt's like, then you seal a deal and that's when the really rewarding stuff starts to happen, like a 30 year life together, for instance.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:36.000\nBut at the same time, the big problem with that is that, you know, you can sometimes feel like, like, well, it's like, well, now I don't, now I'm not on fire all the time.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:46.000\nLike, now we're actually, now you know what a shitty person I am. Now we fight sometimes and then the person I had that fight with is still there, you know.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:55.000\nIt's not like you're getting a fight and you're like, I don't want to see you anymore. It's like, we got in a fight and now I'm going to keep seeing you forever because I love you, but we had like eight fights.\n\n04:55.000 --> 05:07.000\nSo it's, and I think that I think the coolest thing is that combats that phenomenon is this shared language. I think that's when artifice really comes in handy.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:21.000\nLike, it's like, like, you get tools, you get told like, okay, this is the phrase, this is a phrase we use for this thing, so that you both know that phrase so that you're not just on autopilot.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:29.000\nSo when you start to get into a fight or something, you actually have a thing that you can talk about, say, go like, oh, is this a scenario seven, you know, kind of thing.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:41.000\nAnd my big thing was that my epiphany has been this thing that the counselor called emotional bids, emotional bids, Jeff. Bids.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:55.000\nSo, you know, when there's two people in a conversation, my thing has always been, well, one person's always going to need something and then the other person's always going to be having to give it, which means that one person's getting like robbed.\n\n05:55.000 --> 06:09.000\nYou know, like, I always feel like everyone's trying to steal my life force away from me and my time, my energy, like, fish hooks are coming at me and they're going to get into me and if I don't fend them off and police my own space,\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:21.000\nI'm going to get dragged into someone else's, like, energy and I'm going to get dragged down and I'm going to lose my life for three hours of playing Borderlands 2 or something.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:27.000\nThe counselor said, here's the thing that couples do, they make emotional bids.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:36.000\nSo you say, like, for instance, one of my big things that makes me insane is that if I'm driving and Aaron says, look at that, look at that thing over there.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:40.000\nMy immediate emotional reaction is to go, God damn it, I don't want to look at shit.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nI always, I hate it.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:43.000\nThat's fair.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:49.000\nI hate it when people, that's my extreme example of, like, how extreme it is with me.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:56.000\nLike, I hate fucking, like, I hate when people go, like, look at that, like, I'm thinking, I hate you, don't make me look it.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:05.000\nI have my own head, I can swivel it, I have eyes, if I want to look at something, I'll look at it, like, that's me being crazy.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:13.000\nBut that's just an example of, like, somebody saying, look at that, or somebody saying, like, oh, Game of Thrones is on tomorrow.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:19.000\nLike, anything, any sound you make, anything, it's an emotional bid.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:23.000\nMy new way of seeing it, the counselor said it to me.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:24.000\nWhy is it a bid?\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nWell, I'm going to.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nDon't interrupt me.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:32.000\nLook over here.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:38.000\nNo, look over here.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:44.000\nYou have to think of the relationship as a third thing in the room with you and your lover.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:49.000\nWhen a person wants something from you, don't even look at it that way.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:56.000\nYou think of it as them putting a little poker chip, a bid, into the relationship bank.\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:07.000\nSo you don't have to think about it like, I have to give you something or you need something, it's like, it's you putting something in to this third thing.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:11.000\nAnd then you can have three responses to that, one of three.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:21.000\nYou can do what's called facing forward, which is like acknowledging it, which is a form of putting your own bid in there to match it.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:26.000\nAnd both parties are going to draw checks on this bank from time to time.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nYou need your relationship to be there when you're feeling bummed out.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:37.000\nSometimes you're sick or you're in bad mood, you feel fat, you want to, you go like, oh, can I fall back on this relationship, you know?\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:47.000\nAnd if it's overdrawn, if there's no trust, if it's like somebody puts a bid in it and then if you go like, for example, by saying like, oh, our favorite show's on tonight.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:52.000\nIf you go, yeah, yeah, that's you taking the bid out, like wiping your ass with it.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:56.000\nI don't know where the metaphor goes, but you're not matching it.\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:08.000\nAnd then what happens is, and this happens a lot with men and women, is that because men have this thing, they think too logically in their discourse.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:11.000\nSo it's like, look at that thing, isn't that pretty?\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:17.000\nAnd then the guy will tend too often to go like, I don't see how that's more pretty than anything else in particular.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:26.000\nTrying to make sure, because I think we're socialized, at least American men are socialized to be more logical, not change our minds and all this stuff.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:37.000\nAnd then like, so that's like an example of you betray the trust and then the other person will double down on the bid and start putting more shit in there.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:42.000\nAnd then they get all messed up and like, they go like, I don't know.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.000\nI do everything and you don't do anything.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:51.000\nIt comes out at random times, like, I could put so much shit into this relationship and all that stuff.\n\n09:51.000 --> 10:05.000\nAll you got to do is just like retrain your brain, even if it's perfunctural, because they've done these studies where they take like, they finally started taking like couples science into like, like they just study us like animals now.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:20.000\nAnd they just take like people who are happy as couples and they just study their behavior and they found that if you can make bad couples emulate good couples behavior, bad couples can turn into good couples.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nThey get happy.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nSo what is the good behavior?\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:26.000\nThe good behavior is just that rhythm of matching emotional bids.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:35.000\nLike someone, if someone petitions the relationship for acknowledgement, then you got to, you got to ring that bell too.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nYou just, just once, that's it.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:37.000\nHey, look at that bridge.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nOh, yeah, that's a great bridge.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:44.000\nLike without being sarcastic, you know, you don't have to agree that it's a great bridge, but you also don't be a shithead.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:59.000\nLike just, just say, yeah, it's a great bridge, like, like, like, like, just, just stop, you know, face forward, like, like literally physically face the person that wants your attention and engage them for just as much time as they said, Game of Thrones is on tomorrow.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:00.000\nYeah, isn't that show great?\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nLike just, just fucking match it.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:05.000\nDon't I want to talk about this look over there thing and look at the bridge thing.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:08.000\nLike, is that, is that, are you, are you making that up as an actual thing?\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:16.000\nNo, like, I, I, hey, look, hey, that restaurant's closed and I got, you know, that's, you might have a bad reaction to her just saying, look at that thing.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nYes, yes.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nReally?\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nAnybody.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nI can't handle like, like, I don't multitask.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:29.000\nSo if I, like, you know, no one ever knows when I'm thinking about something that, that, like, I could just be standing or doing nothing.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:34.000\nAnd what you don't know is that I'm actually engaged in something mentally.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:35.000\nRight.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:38.000\nAnd then somebody goes like, like, you like hot dogs?\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:44.000\nLike, like, if, if I was literally not thinking about anything, if I was just going like, I hope someone talks to me and someone goes, you like hot dogs?\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:47.000\nI'll go like, oh, I like all kinds of them.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:54.000\nI like foot logs and I like mustard and, and, and that person's like, God, I'm so glad I came over and talked to Dan Harmon.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:59.000\nBut if I, here I am, I'm not only am I, I'm learning about hot dogs.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nI thought I knew about them.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nHe knows more.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nAnd, and, and then we're like, you know, cut to us.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nLike just arm and arm.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:19.000\nWe got a hot dog store or some kind of, but, but if I'm standing there and I happen to be like running some kind of like program, like I'm going like, I've got just thinking about something.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:26.000\nLike running through a conversation in my head or, you know, creating my next masterpiece, of course.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nYou guys didn't laugh hard enough at that.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nNow I feel like a shithead.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nDidn't sound like a joke.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nI'm like an emotional bid.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nAnd then you're like hot dogs.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nI'm like, what?\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nYeah.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:47.000\nYeah.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nLike mad, like shaking you off like you're a mosquito.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:51.000\nWhat?\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nWhat?\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nWhat are you asking me?\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:54.000\nBecause I don't even hear it the first time.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:55.000\nI just hear like noise.\n\n12:55.000 --> 13:01.000\nI'm like, what, what, what, what, what, what do you want?\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nI'll just ask you if you like hot dogs.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:03.000\nOkay.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nOh yeah.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:05.000\nI like hot dogs.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:06.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nYou know, I kind of like.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:12.000\nCreating a masterpiece of my clientele.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:27.000\nSo, so that may or may not ever change about me, but what can change about me is I can go from not valuing the relationship enough to take action to valuing the relationship enough to take action.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:34.000\nSo, so if it's like, it's not about me, that was my big fear about couples therapy is like, oh, they're going to pop the hood open on me.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:38.000\nI know it's not her that's going to have to change a bunch of shit for us to be happy.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:47.000\nThere's going to be fucking blue wires and red wires going to be cut and one of them is going to blow up and the, but, but it's not that.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nIt's not really that case.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:54.000\nIt's like, it's for better or for worse, the kind of like the couples therapy perspective is if you're fucked up, you're fucked up.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:58.000\nBut how do you, how do you make a relationship work with a fucked up person?\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:05.000\nThe fucked up person like what while you're fucked up, here's some things you can do to make your relationship not fucked up.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:13.000\nSo in that moment now, now that you have that, that, that intellectual knowledge of like the emotional bids thing.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nNow when you're in your own, because I'm also the same way.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:21.000\nI think probably most of us are like, I get lost in my own thoughts and when somebody interrupts them, I have no idea what's going on.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:25.000\nLike I'm kind of listening where I'm kind of also caught up in my own shit.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:32.000\nNow if Aaron says look at that bridge or do you like hot dogs, you, you, you still going to probably react in that first moment of.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nNo, emotionally, yes.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:39.000\nLike I won't be able to stop myself from like the counselor says it's like when you hit your knee with a hammer.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:48.000\nIt's just a reflex reflexes or reflexes, but you have an internal reflexive reaction, but that can be a dinner bell.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:52.000\nLike that can be like a triangle that rings that you, that is a reminder.\n\n14:52.000 --> 15:03.000\nOh, this is the, that moment where I, I do that thing where I stop, face her and acknowledge what she just said.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:09.000\nAnd then go back to, you know, so it's like, yeah, it's literally just changing your behavior.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nSo, so you're, you're lost in thought.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:12.000\nYou're creating a masterpiece.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nSomeone says, do you like hot dogs?\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:15.000\nYou hear, wow, wow, wow, wow.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:18.000\nSo in my head, I go, what the fuck, who, what does he want?\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nShut up.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:24.000\nAnd then I turn, I started like, like, did you say, do I like hot dogs?\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nYes, I did.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nYeah, I do.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:33.000\nI'm so glad I talked to Dan Harmon.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nAnd you know what, sir?\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:44.000\nIf I was just thinking about my next masterpiece, so I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm going to go back to that.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nMy emotional bid.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nNow he can either honor that or not.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nHe can, he can be like, fuck off.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nGet your head out of your ass.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nYou fucking fuck.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:56.000\nWhatever.\n\n15:56.000 --> 16:00.000\nBut, but, but yeah, it's like, like that's another form of an emotional biz.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:03.000\nBe honest about whether or not you want to hang out or need space.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:12.000\nHow do you know when, I guess the metaphor for the bid thing is that you can, you can keep anti-ing and someone can keep just taking the money off the table and not put anything back in.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:24.000\nThat's, that's, that's every guy's first question is what if you keep matching emotional bids and you keep having to look at 20 bridges per second.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\nThat's my, it was my first question.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:38.000\nAnd then I went to the Rick and Morty writers room and I was so excited about these tools I had learned and every guy was like, immediately was like, what if, but what if you look at the bridge and then say a nice bridge and then you got to do it again five seconds later.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:54.000\nThat, that what if, what if the other person abuses me doing the normal right thing and is called mistrust and, and trust is the foundation of a relationship.\n\n16:54.000 --> 17:02.000\nSo you can, you can change anything you want about a house, but if you don't have trust in a relationship, it doesn't, it just doesn't matter.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nIt's just like a fucked up house.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:09.000\nSo, so, so you just have to fucking jump in like, you just have to do the sides of that.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:12.000\nYou're not going to have to look at 20 bridges. There aren't 20 bridges.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:18.000\nShe's like, like, she really, she really just wants, it's like breathing, it's respiration.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\nLook at the, look at the bridge.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nIt's nice. It's just like, am I, am I in a relationship with you?\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:31.000\nI'm just a microscopic little penny stock level, like, like just a little micro trade, like that keeps the fucking market going.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:32.000\nLook at that bridge. Yeah.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:33.000\nOkay. I see that bridge.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:36.000\nI'm in the space with you. I am not, I am not numb.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:41.000\nI am not like, like astral projecting over Miami right now.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:45.000\nWhat is, what does your stance on bridges?\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nLike, do you, do you like bridges?\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nI don't ever need to look at them.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:59.000\nI think that people put them there because there was something that needed to be ignored, like a ravine.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:03.000\nLook at that, people were saying, look at that ravine.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:06.000\nAnd they're like, yeah, we got to put a bridge over that thing.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nNow, 20 years later, there's a bridge on that.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:13.000\nIt's like, it's like, how, like, I don't have to worry about my, the teeth fillings.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nIt fell the teeth.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nI just got to eat the corn.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nSo that's, I'm living my life and I want to look at my teeth.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:23.000\nWhat about the Brooklyn Bridge or the San Francisco Golden Gate?\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:28.000\nJust a big dumb thing that, that's just a big dumb thing, Jeff. It's a bridge. Who cares?\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nSeven people died in the construction of that.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:35.000\nThey should, they, they were probably looking at the fucking bridge too much.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nOh, look at this bridge I'm building.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nNo, look at your work.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:42.000\nThey died when there was no bridge. They died when it was still a river.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:45.000\nWell, it's so good. It's good they built the bridge. Thank you for dying.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nI don't want to look at the, I don't want to look at the bridge.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nWhy not?\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:54.000\nBecause it's a bridge, and I see it on a postcard. It's everywhere. It doesn't matter. I see it on TV.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:57.000\nDo you like, do you like building or do you like to see a skyscraper?\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:01.000\nNo, I don't like architecture. I think it's all dumb.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:04.000\nI don't like, I think that's what we're learning right now is that you just,\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:07.000\nlike there's certain things that some people find fascinating that you don't disregard.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nYeah.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\nDo you like nature? Like you say, look at that sunset. Look at that mountain. Look at that.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:14.000\nBarely. Barely. Nature gets this much from me.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:20.000\nI, when we were at, you know, if I, if I'm in a new climate, like when we went to Banff,\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:29.000\nthe city so nice they removed its vowels. It was like in the middle of a national party.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nSo nice they effed it twice.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nThe, yes, that's it. Okay.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:34.000\nThank you.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nYes.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:38.000\nThat did deserve a plus.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:42.000\nIt deserved exactly that much.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:46.000\nNo, it didn't deserve a standing ovation. It deserved a nice polite.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:50.000\nIt was like a parlor trick what you did there. It was like, it's like,\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:55.000\nlike if you'd made a ping pong ball come out of my nose, it would deserve that much a plus.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:58.000\nYeah. If it's breathtaking, you know, it's like, wow, look at that.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:04.000\nThat looks like the shining. It looks like, it looks like that movie I like.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nRight.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:08.000\nYou know, look at all those trees. There's so many trees.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:11.000\nYou never, you never just drive it on the road or just stop and go, oh my God,\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nthere's fucking beautiful water right now.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:19.000\nI do that once. I took a road trip by myself.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nWere you hurt during the process?\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:25.000\nI remember like, I'm just going to drive and I'm going to like look at nature.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nWas this your vision quest?\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:31.000\nYeah, my vision quest where I ended up just eating at different sizzlers across the country.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:34.000\nBecause I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:39.000\nI was like, I'm just going to get out there and throw a blade of grass in the air in whichever way it points.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:43.000\nI'm going to drive that way and, you know, I'm going to meet Reese Witherspoon\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:48.000\nand she's going to guide me on a thing or make a mixtape for me\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:52.000\nand I'm going to get cancer and then recover.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:55.000\nAll the shins are going to be playing and I'm going to be like,\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:59.000\nlike finding shit is going to be me in a silhouetted against the sun\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:04.000\non a cliff edge going, ah!\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:08.000\nJust different hotels, people going, do you have a reservation?\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:12.000\nNo. Well, what were you thinking?\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:16.000\nI'm on a vision quest.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nIn Denver?\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:21.000\nI didn't know I was going to end up here.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:26.000\nOoh la la, you're in the asshole suite.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:29.000\nThere's coffee in the morning.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:32.000\nDo you not want us to tell you that?\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:37.000\nChief vision quest?\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:40.000\nNo, I want to know this coffee.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:43.000\nI was like, I'm just going to drive, I'm going to take this back road\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:47.000\nand then the sun was setting over this field and I was like,\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:51.000\nI bet that's the kind of thing that people call beautiful.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:54.000\nYou mean human beings?\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:57.000\nI'm going to get out of the car and enjoy it like in a movie\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:00.000\nand I pulled my car over.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:04.000\nI was like perfectly quiet and beautiful and I got out of the car\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:08.000\nand I was just like into a cloud of gnats.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:14.000\nAnd I ran five feet down the road.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:18.000\nJesus Christ, that cloud and the gnats followed me.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:22.000\nImagine that cloud of gnats, they're like, do they like heads?\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:27.000\nI don't understand gnats, are they waiting for a head?\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:31.000\nAnd then when one comes to them, they're like, we're stoked.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:35.000\nI think that you perceive a gnat cloud because your head is in a bunch of gnats.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:38.000\nThere's also gnats over there too.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:41.000\nNo, but they're in clouds gnats.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:44.000\nThere's like a cloud, such a thing as a cloud of gnats.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:48.000\nIt's an isolated localized phenomenon.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:51.000\nThey cluster, they like each other.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:57.000\nI don't know if that's just them reproducing or talking, sharing notes on gnats,\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:01.000\nand then your head goes in it, but it seems like once your head goes in it,\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nthey're like, there's a head!\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:06.000\nAnd you move your head and they move with you because they're like,\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:09.000\nit's a head, that's our new religion.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nWe left this guy's head.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nIt start does it here.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:16.000\nBecause they left it going in your nose and your ears.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:23.000\nThey're little gratos, like gnats are hooking up in your mouth.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:30.000\nAnyways, so I got back in the car and yeah, I never got out of it again.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:34.000\nAnd I'm still happy, I'm still creating masterpieces.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:40.000\nBut are you saying that you don't generally or frequently or sometimes once in a while\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:44.000\nhave like look around and go, oh shit, like that's what I want to do?\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:49.000\nYeah, no, I like weather, like I go like, oh, it's such a beautiful night,\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nlike when it's really nice.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nYeah, I like that.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nTactile, like things.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.000\nLike, oh, what a nice feeling night.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:02.000\nLike a little salty blanket around me.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:05.000\nA salty blanket?\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:10.000\nDo you want me to give you a salty blanket?\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:14.000\nIs that where you jitter my head or something like that?\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:18.000\nIt's a little, just to call it out like that.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:23.000\nOh, and also, hey, listen to this.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:26.000\nListen to the sound my throat makes when I laugh now.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:32.000\nWait, you have to listen for the, like.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nTo the, for the rheumatism?\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:37.000\nIt sounds like a card and bicycle spokes.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:43.000\nWhat on earth?\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nThat's not good.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nThat's what I asked the doctor.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.600\nThat's not good.\n\n24:48.600 --> 24:51.320\nI went to an eyes, nose, and throat guy.\n\n24:51.320 --> 24:52.560\nWhat is that about?\n\n24:52.560 --> 24:53.320\nWell, I don't know what.\n\n24:53.320 --> 24:54.280\nI want a fucking answer.\n\n24:54.280 --> 24:56.280\nI don't want to live in a world where there's no answer for that.\n\n24:56.280 --> 24:57.960\nWell, he put a camera.\n\n24:57.960 --> 25:04.840\nFirst, he numbed to my nose by shoving a wad of cotton up my nose.\n\n25:04.840 --> 25:06.720\nAnd then he gave me five minutes.\n\n25:06.720 --> 25:08.200\nI'll give you five minutes.\n\n25:08.200 --> 25:09.200\nThat'll numb your nose.\n\n25:09.200 --> 25:10.040\nYou'll thank me.\n\n25:10.040 --> 25:13.160\nHa, ha, ha.\n\n25:13.160 --> 25:19.400\nAnd then he came back and, like, like, what do they do when they leave for five minutes?\n\n25:19.400 --> 25:23.520\nIs that just that, like, like, doctors fucking suck at the worst.\n\n25:23.520 --> 25:25.040\nThey're just a chair life.\n\n25:25.040 --> 25:27.640\nHe's not going to hang out for the five minutes that you're going to get numb.\n\n25:27.640 --> 25:29.320\nHe's going to go do a thing.\n\n25:29.320 --> 25:30.720\nThey answer an email.\n\n25:30.720 --> 25:32.680\nPut some candy crush.\n\n25:32.680 --> 25:33.800\nAnd he put candy.\n\n25:33.800 --> 25:36.280\nI thought he was going to place candy crush.\n\n25:36.280 --> 25:41.880\nSo he comes back and then he takes this camera, which is like, it's like a spaghetti noodle,\n\n25:41.880 --> 25:44.160\nlike a black spaghetti noodle.\n\n25:44.160 --> 25:49.000\nAnd he just inserts it into my nasal passage and I can feel it.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.960\nHe says, this won't hurt, but it will tickle.\n\n25:51.960 --> 25:59.720\nHe was right, but it will hurt psychologically to know a thing is invading your fucking\n\n25:59.720 --> 26:01.720\npassages.\n\n26:01.720 --> 26:06.120\nIt didn't physically hurt, but it broke my mind.\n\n26:06.120 --> 26:10.040\nIt made me feel small and like an animal.\n\n26:10.040 --> 26:20.040\nIt made me feel like a small animal, like a, like a, like an ocelot at a zoo.\n\n26:20.040 --> 26:23.640\nAnd they're, and they're just like, he just like kept feeding it and I can feel it going\n\n26:23.640 --> 26:24.640\ndown my throat.\n\n26:24.640 --> 26:27.000\nLike, it was like, you're totally like, you're awake.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.000\nYeah.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:29.000\nI'm just hanging out.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:30.760\nI'm sitting in a chair and he gave you like a local anesthetic.\n\n26:30.760 --> 26:31.760\nYeah.\n\n26:31.760 --> 26:32.760\nNose.\n\n26:32.760 --> 26:33.760\nYeah.\n\n26:33.760 --> 26:34.760\nMeanwhile, this thing going down your throat.\n\n26:34.760 --> 26:35.760\nYeah.\n\n26:35.760 --> 26:36.760\nYeah.\n\n26:36.760 --> 26:37.760\nAnd he's like, okay.\n\n26:37.760 --> 26:40.360\nI don't know if he's just trying to be different.\n\n26:40.360 --> 26:45.520\nI'd say it probably opens up your, like, I is up your leverage.\n\n26:45.520 --> 26:46.680\nSo you're, well, why not?\n\n26:46.680 --> 26:48.280\nAh, is he just trying to be hip?\n\n26:48.280 --> 26:49.280\nI don't know.\n\n26:49.280 --> 26:53.760\nI think he sounds more, maybe I think he's like, ah, he's like fucking bullshit.\n\n26:53.760 --> 26:54.760\nYeah.\n\n26:54.760 --> 27:03.120\nSay, ah, this is silver like, man, say E. It wasn't open your mouth and say, so I said\n\n27:03.120 --> 27:07.600\nE. And then every time I said it, like, I could feel it in my fucking like nose membrane\n\n27:07.600 --> 27:08.600\nvibrating.\n\n27:08.600 --> 27:10.800\nThat's why he had you say E because he knew that would fucking happen.\n\n27:10.800 --> 27:13.320\nOh, he's not looking at my nose thing.\n\n27:13.320 --> 27:17.000\nThat's just where the cables run down my fucking throat.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nBut that's symptomatic.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.240\nHe wants to look at something in my throat.\n\n27:19.240 --> 27:22.640\nSo he says like, okay, there's no, there's no tumors on your vocal cords.\n\n27:22.640 --> 27:24.200\nHe just fucking blurted that out.\n\n27:24.200 --> 27:28.760\nI'm like, thanks for letting me know that was a possibility.\n\n27:28.760 --> 27:33.160\nSo when I, when you heard that, you thought, let's look for that tumor.\n\n27:33.160 --> 27:36.800\nLet's find out where that tumor is and just kept your fucking cool.\n\n27:36.800 --> 27:39.200\nThat's what he should have done with that five minutes.\n\n27:39.200 --> 27:43.160\nWell my nose, no, I'm just gonna take this five minutes to talk about, talk to you about\n\n27:43.160 --> 27:44.160\nfucking cancer.\n\n27:44.160 --> 27:47.280\nNo, because then you, then your throat would tighten up and the thing wouldn't get in there.\n\n27:47.280 --> 27:48.920\nYou want to be fucking loose as a goose.\n\n27:48.920 --> 27:52.880\nSo everything's, everything's built on a lie in these, in these buildings and it's full\n\n27:52.880 --> 27:56.400\nof these people in white coats that, that, that they have.\n\n27:56.400 --> 27:57.400\nTake it easy, man.\n\n27:57.400 --> 28:04.480\nThere's no, there's no, I've said, said it before, I'll say it again, a serial killer\n\n28:04.480 --> 28:09.840\nis, is just a doctor without a parental support system.\n\n28:09.840 --> 28:14.040\nIt's just, it's just, it's just a kid who didn't, couldn't afford medical school.\n\n28:14.040 --> 28:17.480\nThey all start by looking at a cat under the crawl space and gets pulled out.\n\n28:17.480 --> 28:18.480\nThey all go like, oh, that's neat.\n\n28:18.480 --> 28:21.040\nI want to see what's inside there.\n\n28:21.040 --> 28:28.320\nAnd then then some of them end up just stalking the fucking streets of, of, of Buffalo.\n\n28:28.320 --> 28:34.200\nAnd then others end up charging you 60 grand to, to, to hit your knee with a hammer.\n\n28:34.200 --> 28:36.440\nYou live in a terrifying world.\n\n28:36.440 --> 28:41.440\nYou just like, like, these people, like, they want to open you up and they, they love it.\n\n28:41.440 --> 28:42.440\nThey love it.\n\n28:42.440 --> 28:43.440\nAnd everything's a shot with them.\n\n28:43.440 --> 28:48.520\nLike, I can't wait to put a needle in you and take out your plasma out of your body,\n\n28:48.520 --> 28:56.400\nyour vital liquids, you, the seawater simulation that we evolved to carry with us, to keep\n\n28:56.400 --> 28:58.600\nus alive.\n\n28:58.600 --> 29:03.680\nYou know, like when we came out of the ocean, are you having a stroke right now, man?\n\n29:03.680 --> 29:07.000\nI, I'm worried about you right now.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:12.200\nDo it, do it, do it again.\n\n29:12.200 --> 29:22.720\nAre you, how do we, I'm pretty sure that's a tumor, that's got to be a tumor.\n\n29:22.720 --> 29:23.720\nWhat makes sense?\n\n29:23.720 --> 29:24.720\nIt's not a tumor.\n\n29:24.720 --> 29:25.720\nIt's not a tumor.\n\n29:25.720 --> 29:26.720\nIt's so dumb.\n\n29:26.720 --> 29:27.720\nDon't, uh, come on.\n\n29:27.720 --> 29:31.720\nNo, that, that doesn't, that does deserve applause too.\n\n29:31.720 --> 29:36.720\nNot more than the f-dit twice, uh, certainly not, certainly not.\n\n29:36.720 --> 29:38.880\nThere's, there's, there's different reasons to applaud.\n\n29:38.880 --> 29:40.880\nThat was some cullier level shit.\n\n29:40.880 --> 29:44.880\nHe said tumor, I can go, it's novel tumor.\n\n29:44.880 --> 29:50.480\nUh, anyways, not to, not to punish you, to keep your reactions organic, you, you, I'm\n\n29:50.480 --> 29:51.480\nnot going to punish you.\n\n29:51.480 --> 29:53.480\nI'm fucking alarmed at that sound.\n\n29:53.480 --> 30:01.680\nThere's like a dude in there, there's like an indie film being produced.\n\n30:01.680 --> 30:06.760\nAnd there's like a guy in a larynx who's like, where am I, where's I, I can't imagine\n\n30:06.760 --> 30:08.560\nwhy, but it felt as raising his hand over here.\n\n30:08.560 --> 30:09.560\nI, please be a doctor.\n\n30:09.560 --> 30:14.560\nUh, I have tumors on my vocal cords, not a big deal.\n\n30:14.560 --> 30:15.560\nOh.\n\n30:15.560 --> 30:20.360\nI, I'm not sure we got that on mic.\n\n30:20.360 --> 30:22.760\nHe said, oh, I have tumors on my vocal cords.\n\n30:22.760 --> 30:23.760\nNot a big deal.\n\n30:23.760 --> 30:24.760\nAll right.\n\n30:24.760 --> 30:25.760\nCool.\n\n30:25.760 --> 30:26.760\nWell, I don't have them.\n\n30:26.760 --> 30:28.840\nSo I probably have something worse.\n\n30:28.840 --> 30:30.960\nIs the tumor in your trachea a big deal?\n\n30:30.960 --> 30:31.960\nYes.\n\n30:31.960 --> 30:32.960\nOkay.\n\n30:32.960 --> 30:33.960\nWell, now I get to.\n\n30:33.960 --> 30:36.760\nDo you, do you make that sound when you do it on an exhale like that?\n\n30:36.760 --> 30:38.760\nAs far as I know, I don't.\n\n30:38.760 --> 30:39.760\nNo.\n\n30:39.760 --> 30:40.760\nTry it out.\n\n30:40.760 --> 30:46.400\nThe reason why I found out about it is because of all this podcaster-y, like I've been listening\n\n30:46.400 --> 30:49.760\nto myself, you can hear it and like, I, you should Tyler's podcast, like you hear, I,\n\n30:49.760 --> 30:55.760\nwhen I laugh, I go off and go, and then, and then like, like, it sounds like the mic's\n\n30:55.760 --> 30:56.760\nbroken or something.\n\n30:56.760 --> 30:58.960\nMaybe you're just, maybe you're just purring.\n\n30:58.960 --> 31:01.560\nAnyways, there's no discomfort or anything.\n\n31:01.560 --> 31:02.560\nIt's just this sound.\n\n31:02.560 --> 31:03.560\nSo I,\n\n31:03.560 --> 31:04.560\nAnother hand is right.\n\n31:04.560 --> 31:05.560\nI want this.\n\n31:05.560 --> 31:06.560\nPlease.\n\n31:06.560 --> 31:07.560\nI'll be doctors.\n\n31:07.560 --> 31:08.560\nDo you snore too?\n\n31:08.560 --> 31:09.560\nI snore and I do.\n\n31:09.560 --> 31:12.360\nWhen I gain a certain amount of weight, I get sleep apnea.\n\n31:12.360 --> 31:16.640\nLike I, I'll, I'll wake up like, like freaking out.\n\n31:16.640 --> 31:17.640\nThank you for asking.\n\n31:17.640 --> 31:22.960\nUh, so that's, these are questions the guy asks a doctor.\n\n31:22.960 --> 31:25.560\nSo he pulls the camera out.\n\n31:25.560 --> 31:27.160\nHe pulls it out, which was so fucked up.\n\n31:27.160 --> 31:28.160\nLike, it was like, it was like, you know,\n\n31:28.160 --> 31:33.260\nHe's pulling out like, like just like anal beads and just like those, like, like anal\n\n31:33.260 --> 31:34.260\nbeads.\n\n31:34.260 --> 31:35.260\nYeah.\n\n31:35.260 --> 31:36.260\nLike yank.\n\n31:36.260 --> 31:38.760\nI'm, I'm assuming nasal beads.\n\n31:38.760 --> 31:39.760\nYeah.\n\n31:39.760 --> 31:40.760\nYeah.\n\n31:40.760 --> 31:45.560\nIt was kind of like, like, like these people don't care about the, you know, they, they\n\n31:45.560 --> 31:47.560\nlook at us like, they look at us like, like animals.\n\n31:47.560 --> 31:50.160\nI'm assuming they reuse that because it's got to be tech technology.\n\n31:50.160 --> 31:52.160\nBut they, they, they, they, how do they clean that thing off?\n\n31:52.160 --> 31:53.160\nIt's been done a million people.\n\n31:53.160 --> 31:54.160\nYeah.\n\n31:54.160 --> 31:55.160\nHe just put it down and I'll bet you 10 bucks.\n\n31:55.160 --> 31:57.960\nThe next guy that came in, he's probably, he probably sprays it.\n\n31:57.960 --> 32:01.960\nHe sprays it with like a, you know, a mist of like avion or something.\n\n32:01.960 --> 32:10.040\nHe probably like runs it under a UV light or something like that, that, that some pharmaceutical\n\n32:10.040 --> 32:12.960\ncompany gave him for free to push pills.\n\n32:12.960 --> 32:15.760\nHere, is that from, from Raziplas.\n\n32:15.760 --> 32:16.960\nIt's a free gift.\n\n32:16.960 --> 32:23.400\nThis, this UV light will make all the AIDS go off of your equipment.\n\n32:23.400 --> 32:24.400\nGo ahead.\n\n32:24.400 --> 32:25.400\nTrust us.\n\n32:25.400 --> 32:26.400\nAnd don't forget Raziplas.\n\n32:26.400 --> 32:32.400\nFor every $80 Raziplas prescription will give you a golf club.\n\n32:32.400 --> 32:34.400\nSo he pulls it out.\n\n32:34.400 --> 32:39.400\nDo you have anything, did he say, here's why you're, you make that sound all of a sudden?\n\n32:39.400 --> 32:40.400\nNo.\n\n32:40.400 --> 32:43.400\nHe said, he said, no tumors on your vocal cords, which I'm now finding out would have been\n\n32:43.400 --> 32:44.400\nthe fucking jackpot.\n\n32:44.400 --> 32:50.400\nNo, it just wouldn't have been a big deal, man.\n\n32:50.400 --> 32:55.400\nAnd now, and then he said, okay, so now I'm going to get, here's what I, here's what\n\n32:55.400 --> 32:57.240\nwe have to eliminate as a possibility.\n\n32:57.240 --> 33:00.400\nYou have acid reflex.\n\n33:00.400 --> 33:05.400\nWhat sometimes can happen is it'll, during your sleep, some acid will splash into your\n\n33:05.400 --> 33:06.400\ntrachea.\n\n33:06.400 --> 33:10.000\nTrachea will swell up a little bit and that can make that sound.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:11.400\nLike the, like, I don't know.\n\n33:11.400 --> 33:12.400\nIt's like a flappy.\n\n33:12.400 --> 33:17.680\nIt looks like your trachea is farting when you're exhaling like, because it's a little\n\n33:17.680 --> 33:19.720\nswollen from the acid.\n\n33:19.720 --> 33:23.960\nSo he gives me like advanced Prilosec, like a kind of like free samples of some kind of\n\n33:23.960 --> 33:24.960\nshit.\n\n33:24.960 --> 33:28.560\nAnd then he gave me a shot at cortisone because I honestly think it's just because they like\n\n33:28.560 --> 33:29.560\nto hurt people.\n\n33:29.560 --> 33:33.400\nI don't, I don't, I don't, the cortisone was supposedly supposed to clear the pathways\n\n33:33.400 --> 33:34.400\nor something.\n\n33:34.400 --> 33:37.200\nThey just, they just don't feel like they've done their job unless they've inflicted some\n\n33:37.200 --> 33:39.200\nkind of torture on someone.\n\n33:39.200 --> 33:42.200\nThey take a nose and that's the first line.\n\n33:42.200 --> 33:46.520\nI know, but why do you think that is if you protest too much, you know, like, like, like,\n\n33:46.520 --> 33:51.480\nokay, all right, I swear to God, I'm not a serial killer.\n\n33:51.480 --> 33:56.760\nIf you have to say that before you go to work, like, fucking go to check it out.\n\n33:56.760 --> 34:01.920\nYou know, I don't know, man, paranoid.\n\n34:01.920 --> 34:07.480\nIt's called, uh, well, uh, Latrophobia.\n\n34:07.480 --> 34:10.480\nFear of doctors.\n\n34:10.480 --> 34:12.480\nLook it up, man.\n\n34:12.480 --> 34:13.480\nAll right.\n\n34:13.480 --> 34:14.480\nSo you're good.\n\n34:14.480 --> 34:15.480\nYou're all right.\n\n34:15.480 --> 34:16.480\nNo, I'm not good.\n\n34:16.480 --> 34:21.040\nI mean, I'm, I mean, I'm Schrodinger's, uh, uh, health.\n\n34:21.040 --> 34:26.040\nI know, because it's not, he gave me this stuff and it's not going away.\n\n34:26.040 --> 34:27.040\nJesus.\n\n34:27.040 --> 34:29.920\nIt's fucking really disturbing.\n\n34:29.920 --> 34:33.040\nSo I had to schedule an appointment.\n\n34:33.040 --> 34:36.760\nIf you, it sounds like almost like a read the way read instruments make notes.\n\n34:36.760 --> 34:37.760\nYeah.\n\n34:37.760 --> 34:39.520\nIf you, if you actually held hard enough, you might make a nice note.\n\n34:39.520 --> 34:40.520\nYeah.\n\n34:40.520 --> 34:41.520\nYeah.\n\n34:41.520 --> 34:42.520\nGo really hard.\n\n34:42.520 --> 34:43.520\nTry it.\n\n34:43.520 --> 34:56.720\nUh, so anyways, if it doesn't go away, which it clearly isn't, and I go to a follow-up\n\n34:56.720 --> 35:03.400\nappointment, then I got to get a CAT scan, which is, as we all know, is the thing you\n\n35:03.400 --> 35:06.640\nget before they tell you you're dying.\n\n35:06.640 --> 35:10.760\nShe, she, I was going to make a bad joke.\n\n35:10.760 --> 35:12.960\nI would have gotten no applause.\n\n35:12.960 --> 35:13.960\nWhat if they gave me a cat?\n\n35:13.960 --> 35:16.560\nWere you going to say, what if they gave you a CAT scan and there was a cat in you?\n\n35:16.560 --> 35:18.960\nI was going to say Schrodinger's CAT scan.\n\n35:18.960 --> 35:19.960\nWow.\n\n35:19.960 --> 35:20.960\nGood night, everybody.\n\n35:20.960 --> 35:31.160\nI think, I don't know how much of that was like, they're like, let's do a bit by it.\n\n35:31.160 --> 35:35.640\nI guarantee the people clapping all thought of that joke too, they're applauding themselves\n\n35:35.640 --> 35:36.640\nfor that one.\n\n35:36.640 --> 35:37.640\nAll right.\n\n35:37.640 --> 35:51.680\nIt's like an HP Lovecraft, like, it's a pineal gland, you can end up sounding like Tom Waits,\n\n35:51.680 --> 35:53.480\nlike, are you going to get that?\n\n35:53.480 --> 35:54.480\nI don't know.\n\n35:54.480 --> 35:55.480\nI don't know, man.\n\n35:55.480 --> 35:57.160\nWell, no, because it's not on my vocal cords.\n\n35:57.160 --> 35:58.160\nIt's not.\n\n35:58.160 --> 35:59.160\nI may end up.\n\n35:59.160 --> 36:00.160\nWait, so what's it on?\n\n36:00.160 --> 36:01.160\nIs it your larynx or what?\n\n36:01.160 --> 36:02.160\nHe's trachea?\n\n36:02.160 --> 36:03.160\nTrachea.\n\n36:03.160 --> 36:18.480\nAll right, let's bring out a son of a doctor, Kumeil Nagyare.\n\n36:18.480 --> 36:24.720\nI am a son of a doctor.\n\n36:24.720 --> 36:31.920\nIt's very hard to bite my little lip back there while you're going off on half my family's\n\n36:31.920 --> 36:33.400\nchosen profession.\n\n36:33.400 --> 36:35.960\nBut your dad's a shrink, right?\n\n36:35.960 --> 36:41.160\nYeah, they're also psychopaths.\n\n36:41.160 --> 36:46.000\nThey're like, we don't just play God with the body, we play God with the mind.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.320\nIs he a psychiatrist or a psychologist?\n\n36:48.320 --> 36:49.320\nIotrist.\n\n36:49.320 --> 36:50.320\nPsychiatrist.\n\n36:50.320 --> 36:54.080\nSo he can, yeah, he's probably experimenting with all kinds of drugs all the time.\n\n36:54.080 --> 37:00.840\nYeah, I'm pretty sure he's like sort of furthering Nazi technology.\n\n37:00.840 --> 37:05.800\nHe's got like people under there that he's crossbred with monkeys and stuff like that.\n\n37:05.800 --> 37:07.320\nHe's doing some new shit.\n\n37:07.320 --> 37:08.320\nI don't know.\n\n37:08.320 --> 37:10.080\nI don't think my dad has an exciting life.\n\n37:10.080 --> 37:17.200\nI don't think he's like, first of all, he is, he's a very kind, nice man.\n\n37:17.200 --> 37:24.320\nAnd he, I think, genuinely is affected by people being sick around him, which is not\n\n37:24.320 --> 37:27.520\ngood because that's not a good doctor.\n\n37:27.520 --> 37:31.680\nYou don't want a doctor who's crying on the operating table, like, oh, fuck this.\n\n37:31.680 --> 37:33.680\nI hope I get this right.\n\n37:33.680 --> 37:35.680\nOh, shit.\n\n37:35.680 --> 37:36.680\nWhy?\n\n37:36.680 --> 37:39.680\nWhy did I choose this?\n\n37:39.680 --> 37:41.040\nI think it really is like that.\n\n37:41.040 --> 37:42.920\nI see him, I see him be affected by that.\n\n37:42.920 --> 37:47.400\nBut I think he's a psychiatrist and I don't, I don't know if he's like dealing with really\n\n37:47.400 --> 37:49.160\ninteresting stuff or anything.\n\n37:49.160 --> 37:51.000\nDoes he have like an office downtown?\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:52.000\nNo.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nDowntown Pakistan?\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:55.000\nYeah.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:56.000\nYeah.\n\n37:56.000 --> 38:03.360\nWell, Pakistan, as you know, is an eight-block radius, isn't it?\n\n38:03.360 --> 38:07.760\nWe just got our second ice cream shop.\n\n38:07.760 --> 38:09.640\nVery exciting.\n\n38:09.640 --> 38:11.760\nWe do have seven Starbucks, though.\n\n38:11.760 --> 38:14.200\nThat's just a Starbucks drug.\n\n38:14.200 --> 38:16.600\nCan I ask you guys a question?\n\n38:16.600 --> 38:21.280\nWhat do you guys make of these people in the movies and on the TV shows when they, when\n\n38:21.280 --> 38:25.920\nsomeone asks them to sit and then they go, I'd rather stand?\n\n38:25.920 --> 38:26.920\nWho, what is it?\n\n38:26.920 --> 38:28.920\nI don't get those people.\n\n38:28.920 --> 38:29.920\nWhy would you?\n\n38:29.920 --> 38:31.920\nThat is a very specific beef, my friend.\n\n38:31.920 --> 38:34.440\nI was just thinking about that.\n\n38:34.440 --> 38:35.440\nYou know, like...\n\n38:35.440 --> 38:39.200\nI mean, also, I would say who tells, I'd like you to sit down for this.\n\n38:39.200 --> 38:40.200\nYeah.\n\n38:40.200 --> 38:41.200\nWho does that, first of all?\n\n38:41.200 --> 38:42.200\nYeah.\n\n38:42.200 --> 38:43.720\nIf someone said to you, like, look at that bridge, you'd be, fuck you.\n\n38:43.720 --> 38:44.720\nYeah.\n\n38:44.720 --> 38:45.720\nAnd so it goes, sit down.\n\n38:45.720 --> 38:46.720\nYou go, fuck, now I'm standing.\n\n38:46.720 --> 38:47.720\nBut I get it.\n\n38:47.720 --> 38:48.720\nOkay, yeah.\n\n38:48.720 --> 38:50.040\nBut it's never like that in the movies.\n\n38:50.040 --> 38:55.640\nIt's more like, it's more like, like, you're supposed to sit because, you know, they want\n\n38:55.640 --> 38:59.320\nto tell you something you don't want to hear and then the person's like, I'll do it, standing.\n\n38:59.320 --> 39:02.320\nLike what kind of, what kind of conviction is that?\n\n39:02.320 --> 39:03.320\nJust sit.\n\n39:03.320 --> 39:04.320\nIt's a free seat.\n\n39:04.320 --> 39:07.000\nHow often do you get to sit in this life?\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:11.080\nI mean, how many battles do you get to fight that you're definitely going to win?\n\n39:11.080 --> 39:12.400\nLike that's one of them, right?\n\n39:12.400 --> 39:13.400\nOh, okay.\n\n39:13.400 --> 39:14.840\nLike, this one I win.\n\n39:14.840 --> 39:15.840\nMake me sit.\n\n39:15.840 --> 39:16.840\nYeah.\n\n39:16.840 --> 39:20.160\nNext time someone tells me to sit, I'm definitely going, I'd rather stand.\n\n39:20.160 --> 39:21.160\nDefinitely.\n\n39:21.160 --> 39:26.520\nYou know what I always wanted to do in my life is when someone says, are we clear?\n\n39:26.520 --> 39:27.680\nI want to say crystal.\n\n39:27.680 --> 39:35.560\nI want to do that, you know, I also want to say like game, recognize game and like a\n\n39:35.560 --> 39:39.600\nironic game, recognize game, recognize game.\n\n39:39.600 --> 39:40.600\nPeople do that.\n\n39:40.600 --> 39:41.600\nNo, no, no.\n\n39:41.600 --> 39:42.600\nThat phrase.\n\n39:42.600 --> 39:43.600\nIt's badass.\n\n39:43.600 --> 39:44.600\nSay it again.\n\n39:44.600 --> 39:45.600\nGame, recognize game.\n\n39:45.600 --> 39:49.040\nLike, like, oh, you're good, I'm good, and we see each other.\n\n39:49.040 --> 39:50.040\nYeah.\n\n39:50.040 --> 39:51.960\nWait, I don't get it.\n\n39:51.960 --> 39:56.240\nLike we're both con artists or not a game.\n\n39:56.240 --> 40:01.520\nI mean, game, you two great minds think alike.\n\n40:01.520 --> 40:02.520\nYeah.\n\n40:02.520 --> 40:03.520\nGame, recognize game.\n\n40:03.520 --> 40:04.520\nThat's so dumb.\n\n40:04.520 --> 40:12.840\nWait, wait, wait, am I not being clear that did not set you up for crystal?\n\n40:12.840 --> 40:16.080\nAlso, he doesn't recognize game, Camille.\n\n40:16.080 --> 40:17.080\nNo.\n\n40:17.080 --> 40:19.080\nI recognize clunky.\n\n40:19.080 --> 40:20.080\nClunky.\n\n40:20.080 --> 40:21.080\nRecognize clunky.\n\n40:21.080 --> 40:23.460\nThat is hard to say.\n\n40:23.460 --> 40:24.960\nGame, recognize game.\n\n40:24.960 --> 40:30.960\nThat's a lot of fucking consonants and you guys have heard that, right?\n\n40:30.960 --> 40:32.600\nThat's not a smooth thing.\n\n40:32.600 --> 40:33.600\nIt's still really stupid.\n\n40:33.600 --> 40:34.600\nIt's really.\n\n40:34.600 --> 40:35.600\nGame, recognize game.\n\n40:35.600 --> 40:37.920\nWell, you know why you guys don't recognize game.\n\n40:37.920 --> 40:38.920\nI recognize game.\n\n40:38.920 --> 40:45.600\nI don't think, I don't think liking that thing means you have game.\n\n40:45.600 --> 40:50.080\nI think that's, that's, that's an absence of games to say no, like Joshua in war games.\n\n40:50.080 --> 40:52.800\nLike, like it makes you sound like a robot.\n\n40:52.800 --> 40:53.800\nGame recognize game.\n\n40:53.800 --> 40:54.800\nYeah.\n\n40:54.800 --> 40:58.320\nNo, it's a conveying an idea with only three words that would take longer than three words\n\n40:58.320 --> 40:59.320\nto convey.\n\n40:59.320 --> 41:00.320\nIt's not even a real sentence.\n\n41:00.320 --> 41:01.320\nIt's caveman language.\n\n41:01.320 --> 41:02.320\nNo, but you're conveying.\n\n41:02.320 --> 41:03.320\nIt doesn't matter if it's a real thing.\n\n41:03.320 --> 41:04.320\nWhat are you conveying?\n\n41:04.320 --> 41:05.320\nI still don't even understand it.\n\n41:05.320 --> 41:06.320\nOkay.\n\n41:06.320 --> 41:07.320\nSee?\n\n41:07.320 --> 41:08.320\nIt's so hard.\n\n41:08.320 --> 41:09.320\nYou've got no game, man.\n\n41:09.320 --> 41:10.320\nYeah.\n\n41:10.320 --> 41:14.760\nIf I had to explain it to you, you've got, you've got, you've got game, you've got game.\n\n41:14.760 --> 41:19.640\nSo if you've got game, and I've got game, game recognize game, also game, game hate\n\n41:19.640 --> 41:20.640\nverbs.\n\n41:20.640 --> 41:21.640\nYeah.\n\n41:21.640 --> 41:22.640\nYeah.\n\n41:22.640 --> 41:23.640\nTacho loves recognize.\n\n41:23.640 --> 41:30.120\nRecognize is a verb, motherfuckers, but, but it, uh, uh, you have to recognize verbs\n\n41:30.120 --> 41:40.480\ngame, game hate sweat, prepositional phrase, let him know fire, kill mother.\n\n41:40.480 --> 41:44.440\nI mean, like, I like, are we clear at crystal because that sounds filming the wire.\n\n41:44.440 --> 41:45.440\nThat's good.\n\n41:45.440 --> 41:46.440\nYeah.\n\n41:46.440 --> 41:48.760\nUm, let me come up with another three word thing.\n\n41:48.760 --> 41:52.320\nOh, uh, uh, vocal cord tumors.\n\n41:52.320 --> 41:53.320\nOkay.\n\n41:53.320 --> 41:54.320\nOh, yeah.\n\n41:54.320 --> 41:55.320\nOkay.\n\n41:55.320 --> 41:56.320\nHere's one.\n\n41:56.320 --> 42:02.080\nAnd by the way, I think you should go to a different doctor.\n\n42:02.080 --> 42:05.160\nI like, yeah, I like how Blassey, that one, I said, I got you got tumors all over your\n\n42:05.160 --> 42:06.160\nthroat.\n\n42:06.160 --> 42:07.160\nIt's no big deal, bro.\n\n42:07.160 --> 42:08.160\nNo big deal.\n\n42:08.160 --> 42:10.160\nHey, I have great news.\n\n42:10.160 --> 42:12.840\nYou have tumors all up in your throat.\n\n42:12.840 --> 42:17.520\nI have to go home.\n\n42:17.520 --> 42:18.960\nGame recognized game.\n\n42:18.960 --> 42:22.160\nI was, I was at the, I may have said this on the show before, but I don't think so.\n\n42:22.160 --> 42:26.680\nI was at the airport at 10am, uh, LAX and one of the shitty terminals cause all LAX\n\n42:26.680 --> 42:28.560\nterminals are the worst cause it's not a good airport.\n\n42:28.560 --> 42:29.560\nI'm from LA.\n\n42:29.560 --> 42:32.080\nI, I'm proud of LA, but our airport is shit.\n\n42:32.080 --> 42:33.080\nAnd I was sitting there.\n\n42:33.080 --> 42:36.320\nIt was like nine, 10am and the bar is rammed at 10am.\n\n42:36.320 --> 42:41.800\nLike somehow it's okay at the airport to get beer with your breakfast at 9am.\n\n42:41.800 --> 42:42.800\nThere's no rules.\n\n42:42.800 --> 42:43.800\nFuck everything.\n\n42:43.800 --> 42:45.480\nAirports, airports are for drinking.\n\n42:45.480 --> 42:46.480\nDrink at an airport.\n\n42:46.480 --> 42:47.480\nIt's fucking great.\n\n42:47.480 --> 42:48.480\nIs it?\n\n42:48.480 --> 42:49.480\nYeah.\n\n42:49.480 --> 42:56.080\nThey have a, they have a, uh, uh, a bar, well, you, in, in, in, in Europe, like, like,\n\n42:56.080 --> 43:00.480\nlike,

Legoland\n\n43:23.560 --> 43:24.560\nright now.\n\n43:24.560 --> 43:31.720\nThere was, there was this bar and, uh, they had pints and they, and they have one in Chicago,\n\n43:31.720 --> 43:37.080\nperhaps to Chicago, O'Hare, O'Hare is the worst airport in Ireland.\n\n43:37.080 --> 43:38.920\nThat's not true.\n\n43:38.920 --> 43:39.920\nNot true.\n\n43:39.920 --> 43:44.920\nBut they

amazing.\n\n45:01.280 --> 45:05.960\nUm, but so it's, so in that sense, it's not the place, it's not a place that I would\n\n45:05.960 --> 45:10.360\ndrink out if it was, it was just in Los Angeles, but, but here's the kick.\n\n45:10.360 --> 45:12.840\nHere's the, here's the thing.\n\n45:12.840 --> 45:15.960\nNo fucking kids because it's like clearly a grown up place.\n\n45:15.960 -->

it's\n\n45:36.600 --> 45:37.600\nthe airport.\n\n45:37.600 --> 45:39.000\nThere's no law here.\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:40.280\nBooze wise.\n\n45:40.280 --> 45:44.240\nYou can't be judged for drinking at 9am because it might be 3pm to you.\n\n45:44.240 --> 45:45.720\nYou might be from Melbourne.\n\n45:45.720 --> 45:47.160\nThat is what it is.\n\n45:47.160 --> 45:48.560\nPeople think they can get away with it.\n\n45:48.560 --> 45:54.360\nAnd also you're in a, like I was just at Chicago O'Hare and where there's like a Mexican,\n\n45:54.360 --> 45:57.360\nlike there's a big, there's a big food court area and off the side is the Mexican place\n\n45:57.360 --> 45:59.680\nof really good guacamole, you know, this place.\n\n45:59.680 --> 46:01.680\nAnd it was really international.\n\n46:01.680 -->

Mexico.\n\n46:11.120 --> 46:12.120\nSomeone was from Portugal.\n\n46:12.120 --> 46:13.680\nIt wasn't all people from Chicago.\n\n46:13.680 --> 46:14.680\nNo.\n\n46:14.680 --> 46:16.840\nI mean, there were people that were connecting through, but everybody was from somewhere\n\n46:16.840 --> 46:19.360\ninteresting and they were all going to cool places too because it's in there.\n\n46:19.360 --> 46:20.360\nHow do you know?\n\n46:20.360 --> 46:21.360\nBecause we all talked.\n\n46:21.360 --> 46:22.360\nIt was 9am.\n\n46:22.360 --> 46:23.360\nHe talks to strangers.\n\n46:23.360 --> 46:24.360\nHe talks to strangers all the time.\n\n46:24.360 --> 46:31.360\nLife is like a Stephen King movie without any threat.\n\n46:31.360 --> 46:35.360\nI'll go for that.\n\n46:35.360 --> 46:36.360\nI'll go for it.\n\n46:36.360 --> 46:37.360\nNo.\n\n46:37.360 --> 46:38.360\nIt's just random people connecting.\n\n46:38.360 --> 46:41.960\nBut there's no boogings outside the fight.\n\n46:41.960 --> 46:43.360\nI forget what terminal in Chicago O'Hare.\n\n46:43.360 --> 46:44.360\nThere's the sporty one.\n\n46:44.360 --> 46:45.360\nIt's kind of shit.\n\n46:45.360 --> 46:46.360\nIt's all brushed aluminum.\n\n46:46.360 --> 46:49.440\nIt is a cranky old fucker that works behind the bar and he's hilarious.\n\n46:49.440 --> 46:53.480\nAnd people that go to the airport a lot go to that bar because he's really funny.\n\n46:53.480 --> 46:54.480\nDo you meet a bunch of characters?\n\n46:54.480 --> 46:56.480\nIt's like a weird cheers kind of situation.\n\n46:56.480 --> 46:59.960\nAnd I actually have met people at that bar in Chicago and gotten their phone numbers\n\n46:59.960 --> 47:04.080\nand hung out with them when I came back to town because it's a good place.\n\n47:04.080 --> 47:05.080\nThis is not good behavior.\n\n47:05.080 --> 47:06.080\nYou shouldn't be.\n\n47:06.080 --> 47:07.080\nIt's called having a personality.\n\n47:07.080 --> 47:08.080\nThis is fucking hanging out with me.\n\n47:08.080 --> 47:09.080\nCrazy.\n\n47:09.080 --> 47:10.080\nYou talk to people.\n\n47:10.080 --> 47:13.880\nSo anyway, let's get back to my fucking story.\n\n47:13.880 --> 47:21.320\nSo I met LAX 10am, maybe even 9am and we're at the fucking bar and it's absolutely jammed\n\n47:21.320 --> 47:22.320\nwith people.\n\n47:22.320 --> 47:24.760\nAnd maybe there was a delay in a flight so it's just completely rammed.\n\n47:24.760 --> 47:26.200\nSo many interesting people, right?\n\n47:26.200 --> 47:27.200\nYeah.\n\n47:27.200 --> 47:29.040\nWell, I get in there and there's nowhere to sit or to stand.\n\n47:29.040 --> 47:30.040\nThere's no seats at the bar.\n\n47:30.040 --> 47:31.040\nThere's no table.\n\n47:31.040 --> 47:34.920\nSo I just walk up and think, I'll have a beer while I'm getting ready to get in the plane.\n\n47:34.920 --> 47:35.920\nIt's 9am.\n\n47:35.920 --> 47:36.920\nI'll have a beer.\n\n47:36.920 --> 47:37.920\nWe're at the airport.\n\n47:37.920 --> 47:38.920\nYeah.\n\n47:38.920 --> 47:45.920\nAnd I go up there and I wave down the bar to her and he looks at me and he goes, ID!\n\n47:45.920 --> 47:46.920\nHe just yells ID!\n\n47:46.920 --> 47:47.920\nOh, Jesus Christ.\n\n47:47.920 --> 47:52.200\nSo I take out my ID and I put it in the bar and then he goes away for a while to make\n\n47:52.200 --> 47:53.200\na drink.\n\n47:53.200 --> 47:54.200\nThen he comes back and goes, what do you want?\n\n47:54.200 --> 47:55.200\nHe didn't look at the ID.\n\n47:55.200 --> 47:56.200\nNo, no, no.\n\n47:56.200 --> 47:57.200\nThe ID is on the bar.\n\n47:57.200 --> 47:58.200\nOkay.\n\n47:58.200 --> 48:00.200\nHe's got his hand on it and he's looking at it and he goes, what do you want?\n\n48:00.200 --> 48:02.200\nI go, I'd like a Modelo speciale.\n\n48:02.200 --> 48:03.200\nHe goes, $6!\n\n48:03.200 --> 48:04.200\nAnd so I go, okay.\n\n48:04.200 --> 48:09.640\nAnd he stands there and waits for me to take the money out.\n\n48:09.640 --> 48:11.320\nLike he couldn't just go make it.\n\n48:11.320 --> 48:14.360\nHe's standing there staring at me with his hand on my ID.\n\n48:14.360 --> 48:17.960\nAnd I take the money out and then he takes the money and goes away.\n\n48:17.960 --> 48:18.960\nHe's all angry.\n\n48:18.960 --> 48:19.960\nIt's fucking 9am.\n\n48:19.960 --> 48:20.960\nIt's too busy.\n\n48:20.960 --> 48:22.560\nHe gives me the beer and there's nowhere to be.\n\n48:22.560 --> 48:26.240\nSo I just stand behind the people at the bar and I start to drink my beer and he goes,\n\n48:26.240 --> 48:28.520\nyou can't stand when you're drinking here.\n\n48:28.520 --> 48:32.920\nAnd I turned to them and said, I can stand it if you can.\n\n48:32.920 --> 48:35.760\nWhich I thought was pretty good for 9am.\n\n48:35.760 --> 48:37.640\nNo fucking laugh at all.\n\n48:37.640 --> 48:39.760\nI can stand it.\n\n48:39.760 --> 48:40.760\nAre we clear?\n\n48:40.760 --> 48:41.760\nCrystal.\n\n48:41.760 --> 48:42.760\nThat's fucking better than that.\n\n48:42.760 --> 48:43.760\nBecause it was on the fucking fly.\n\n48:43.760 --> 48:44.760\nYeah.\n\n48:44.760 --> 48:47.040\nYou can't stand when you're drinking here.\n\n48:47.040 --> 48:50.920\nI can stand it if you can.\n\n48:50.920 --> 48:51.920\nNo.\n\n48:51.920 --> 48:54.920\nDon't give me your fucking bullshit apply.\n\n48:54.920 --> 48:55.920\nI thought it was pretty good.\n\n48:55.920 --> 49:00.520\nFor me, the least believable part of the story is that a beer at the airport costs $6.\n\n49:00.520 --> 49:01.520\nIt was $8.\n\n49:01.520 --> 49:02.520\nWhatever the fuck it was, $8.\n\n49:02.520 --> 49:08.120\nSo speaking of Chicago, you were in my hometown of Milwaukee.\n\n49:08.120 --> 49:09.120\nYeah.\n\n49:09.120 --> 49:10.120\nI'm in Chicago.\n\n49:10.120 --> 49:11.120\nI was in Chicago, Minneapolis and Milwaukee.\n\n49:11.120 --> 49:12.120\nIt was great.\n\n49:12.120 --> 49:13.120\nWas it?\n\n49:13.120 --> 49:14.120\nWere they a good crowd in Milwaukee?\n\n49:14.120 --> 49:15.120\nThey were an awesome crowd.\n\n49:15.120 --> 49:16.120\nI asked you.\n\n49:16.120 --> 49:17.120\nI was like, hey, what's the vibe of the city?\n\n49:17.120 --> 49:20.120\nAnd you said blue collar liberal.\n\n49:20.120 --> 49:21.120\nYeah.\n\n49:21.120 --> 49:22.120\nYeah.\n\n49:22.120 --> 49:23.120\nYeah.\n\n49:23.120 --> 49:24.120\nIt was awesome.\n\n49:24.120 --> 49:25.120\nI had a great time.\n\n49:25.120 --> 49:26.120\nI met Frito.\n\n49:26.120 --> 49:27.120\nFrito.\n\n49:27.120 --> 49:29.000\nHe did not introduce himself as that.\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:30.000\nIs it Frito?\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:31.000\nFrito.\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:38.120\nWell, his name is Frito, F-R-I-E-D-E-L, German name, but we always called him Frito, because\n\n49:38.120 --> 49:39.120\nit just sounds like Frito.\n\n49:39.120 --> 49:40.120\nFrito.\n\n49:40.120 --> 49:41.120\nThese guys.\n\n49:41.120 --> 49:42.120\nNo.\n\n49:42.120 --> 49:43.120\nRob Schrab.\n\n49:43.120 --> 49:44.520\nIt was Schraub yesterday.\n\n49:44.520 --> 49:50.680\nHe told me the story of how he drove you around while you were losing your virginity in the\n\n49:50.680 --> 49:51.680\nbackseat.\n\n49:51.680 --> 50:02.960\nWell, that actually sounds better than the sad fact is that he would accompany me because\n\n50:02.960 --> 50:10.600\nI was afraid to navigate the freeway systems of Milwaukee when I was 16, 17, 16, I was\n\n50:10.600 --> 50:15.160\nlike, I don't know how to get to this girl's apartment without getting lost.\n\n50:15.160 --> 50:21.040\nSo he would come with me because he was more grown up than me at our age.\n\n50:21.040 --> 50:27.760\nAnd I rewarded him for his partnership by letting him sit in the girl's living room\n\n50:27.760 --> 50:30.920\nand watch TV while I would make out with her in her bedroom.\n\n50:30.920 --> 50:31.920\nAnd then-\n\n50:31.920 --> 50:32.920\nWhat about the family?\n\n50:32.920 --> 50:38.320\nWell, do you mean the kid, her kid that was in a crib next to the bed where we were making\n\n50:38.320 --> 50:41.840\nout?\n\n50:41.840 --> 50:47.600\nYou know, sometimes just like a little physical detail in a story opens up the whole afternoon.\n\n50:47.600 --> 50:48.600\nYeah.\n\n50:48.600 --> 50:49.600\nYeah.\n\n50:49.600 --> 50:54.320\nPicture a crib with a baby in it and then me making out with the mother of the child\n\n50:54.320 --> 51:01.040\nand then above, on the wall above us is a dot matrix printed banner for new kids on\n\n51:01.040 --> 51:02.040\nthe block.\n\n51:02.040 --> 51:03.040\nWow.\n\n51:03.040 --> 51:05.400\nThat just said new kids on the block.\n\n51:05.400 --> 51:08.480\nAnd actually said, I heart Jordan Knight.\n\n51:08.480 --> 51:12.760\nEvery detail of this story made me sadder.\n\n51:12.760 --> 51:18.200\nShe printed that out for herself and that's in the nursery that she loves Jordan Knight.\n\n51:18.200 --> 51:19.200\nHold.\n\n51:19.200 --> 51:20.800\nShe was like 20, I think.\n\n51:20.800 --> 51:21.800\nOh, okay.\n\n51:21.800 --> 51:22.800\nYeah.\n\n51:22.800 --> 51:23.800\nOld enough to know better.\n\n51:23.800 --> 51:24.800\nThat's how I wrote.\n\n51:24.800 --> 51:29.120\nI didn't know if I wanted a woman old enough that Howard having a baby wasn't like kind\n\n51:29.120 --> 51:30.520\nof a bummer.\n\n51:30.520 --> 51:34.600\nBut then the NKOTB thing, that's what I'm calling it.\n\n51:34.600 --> 51:36.120\nThat would have been a bummer.\n\n51:36.120 --> 51:38.200\nSo there's no good age for that.\n\n51:38.200 --> 51:39.200\nNo.\n\n51:39.200 --> 51:42.560\nUnless she was like, it was like, you know, Susan Sarandon and I was like, you know, coming\n\n51:42.560 --> 51:43.560\nup.\n\n51:43.560 --> 51:45.280\nBut then why does she like, why does she like new kids on the block?\n\n51:45.280 --> 51:46.280\nThen that's.\n\n51:46.280 --> 51:47.280\nOh, that'd be weird.\n\n51:47.280 --> 51:48.280\nWell, maybe.\n\n51:48.280 --> 51:49.280\nMaybe she thought our baby would like it.\n\n51:49.280 --> 51:50.280\nYeah.\n\n51:50.280 --> 51:51.280\nThat is the banner.\n\n51:51.280 --> 51:56.440\nSo for poor Frito, not only would he like wingman me or whatever you call that, like\n\n51:56.440 --> 52:01.080\nsat in the living room and like, well, we would make out chauffeur when it when it finally\n\n52:01.080 --> 52:06.240\ncame time for me to, uh, discard my maidenhood.\n\n52:06.240 --> 52:15.600\nHey, you're not being very crystal, right?\n\n52:15.600 --> 52:17.280\nWhat do you mean discard your maidenhood?\n\n52:17.280 --> 52:19.280\nLosers virginity.\n\n52:19.280 --> 52:24.680\nUh, wait, I was trying to come up with Frazier talk for lose my virginity.\n\n52:24.680 --> 52:25.680\nYeah.\n\n52:25.680 --> 52:26.680\nWell, whatever.\n\n52:26.680 --> 52:27.680\nOkay.\n\n52:27.680 --> 52:28.680\nAll right.\n\n52:28.680 --> 52:30.080\nI was, it was, it was a bit.\n\n52:30.080 --> 52:31.080\nThe assholes.\n\n52:31.080 --> 52:33.600\nSo it was with the same thing.\n\n52:33.600 --> 52:34.600\nThis isn't Donahue.\n\n52:34.600 --> 52:35.600\nAll right.\n\n52:35.600 --> 52:36.600\nSorry.\n\n52:36.600 --> 52:37.600\nDonahue.\n\n52:37.600 --> 52:41.840\nDonahue was a show in the, there was a, there was a guy around the time that the Billie\n\n52:41.840 --> 52:43.800\nJean video was playing.\n\n52:43.800 --> 52:44.800\nYeah.\n\n52:44.800 --> 52:47.400\nRight after he was our Ricky Lake.\n\n52:47.400

lady.\n\n53:01.640 --> 53:02.640\nDating.\n\n53:02.640 --> 53:03.640\nYeah.\n\n53:03.640 --> 53:04.640\nHook it up.\n\n53:04.640 --> 53:05.640\nAnd you were how old?\n\n53:05.640 --> 53:06.640\nYou were younger than her?\n\n53:06.640 --> 53:07.640\n16, 16.\n\n53:07.640 --> 53:08.640\nHow did you meet her?\n\n53:08.640 --> 53:10.640\nOnline, but it wasn't really, yeah, it wasn't really called online yet.\n\n53:10.640 --> 53:16.160\nIt was like a modem chat, a chat room.\n\n53:16.160 --> 53:17.160\nYeah.\n\n53:17.160 --> 53:18.160\nWas she a babe?\n\n53:18.160 --> 53:23.480\nShe was, I met a lot of good looking, uh, uh, young ladies, uh, but, but like, like,\n\n53:23.480 --> 53:30.520\nyeah, I never, like considering the possibilities, you know, it could have easily, you

considering how the many ways that could have gone, I was very lucky.\n\n53:38.560 --> 53:40.120\nSo, so she lived in Milwaukee.\n\n53:40.120 --> 53:41.120\nYou lived in Milwaukee.\n\n53:41.120 --> 53:42.120\nUm, yeah.\n\n53:42.120 --> 53:45.640\nAnd so Frito, you would have a friend of yours drive you because you didn't like navigating\n\n53:45.640 --> 53:46.640\nthe mean streets of Milwaukee.\n\n53:46.640 --> 53:49.880\nI just didn't even know how I was just like, I would, and I, and I, and I, and it's barely\n\n53:49.880 --> 53:50.880\ndifferent now.\n\n53:50.880 --> 53:56.880\nYou're navigating the, the highways, Milwaukee, your own manhood, so much going on, right?\n\n53:56.880 --> 53:57.880\nYeah.\n\n53:57.880 --> 54:01.880\nSo I, when I came to, I made a virginity, this is just to say how cool Frito is.\n\n54:01.880 --> 54:05.800\nFrito didn't drive me around while I did it in the backseat.\n\n54:05.800 --> 54:09.480\nWe drove to under the home bridge in Milwaukee.\n\n54:09.480 --> 54:10.800\nIt was the dead of winter.\n\n54:10.800 --> 54:14.360\nShe didn't want to fuck by the baby.\n\n54:14.360 --> 54:15.360\nIs that what it was?\n\n54:15.360 --> 54:16.840\nWell, her mom had come home.\n\n54:16.840 --> 54:21.680\nIt's the night that we did it, her mom came home and was angry because she had found out\n\n54:21.680 --> 54:30.080\nthat the girl had taped back together a check for the new kids on the block fan club that,\n\n54:30.080 --> 54:35.160\nthat the mother had ripped up because she hadn't done some chore or something.\n\n54:35.160 --> 54:39.560\nSo the daughter had, the daughter had taped it back together, sent it to the new kids\n\n54:39.560 --> 54:45.840\non the block and they cashed it because they saw the writing on the wall.\n\n54:45.840 --> 54:46.840\nWhat was it?\n\n54:46.840 --> 54:47.840\nDo you realize?\n\n54:47.840 --> 54:48.840\nWhat was the amount?\n\n54:48.840 --> 54:49.840\nIn sync is coming.\n\n54:49.840 --> 54:51.560\nWhat was the amount on that check?\n\n54:51.560 --> 54:54.600\nIt was like a fucking dollar, I think it was literally a dollar.\n\n54:54.600 --> 54:56.000\nWhat is that dollar by you?\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:57.000\nI don't know.\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:58.000\nA more printer ink?\n\n54:58.000 --> 54:59.000\nI don't know.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:00.000\nI really don't know.\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:01.000\nThat is, God, the story.\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:05.840\nBut so they got this big, big drunken fight and the mom like pulled out a steak knife\n\n55:05.840 --> 55:11.920\nand was like, and I was like in my acrylic sweater with my rat tail and my, my earring\n\n55:11.920 --> 55:17.680\nand my pimples going like, hey, cool down, man.\n\n55:17.680 --> 55:19.680\nYou guys are mother and daughter.\n\n55:19.680 --> 55:20.680\nIs there a baby?\n\n55:20.680 --> 55:23.680\nYou love each other, man.\n\n55:23.680 --> 55:24.680\nAnd it was so romantic.\n\n55:24.680 --> 55:28.480\nThe kid is not my son.\n\n55:28.480 --> 55:35.000\nAnd so for it to reward me for my valor, we went under the home bridge and you knew it\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:36.000\nwas for this.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.800\nShe was like, listen, you stood up for me against my mom.\n\n55:38.800 --> 55:42.760\nI'm going to take your maiden heart, but she faced it.\n\n55:42.760 --> 55:43.760\nThat was the deal.\n\n55:43.760 --> 55:44.760\nLike seriously.\n\n55:44.760 --> 55:46.760\nShe was like, let's go get this guy.\n\n55:46.760 --> 55:50.360\nI think it was where like kind of like, this is you losing your virginity, the story.\n\n55:50.360 --> 55:51.360\nYeah.\n\n55:51.360 --> 55:55.400\nSo you'd been working out, you'd been making out with her and you guys hadn't had sex yet.\n\n55:55.400 --> 55:56.400\nRight.\n\n55:56.400 --> 55:59.080\nAnd then it was like, this is, I mean, I think it was just a culmination of emotional.\n\n55:59.080 --> 56:01.920\nNow there was an emotional crisis and yeah, it was like, let's go.\n\n56:01.920 --> 56:02.920\nLet's go somewhere.\n\n56:02.920 --> 56:03.920\nIt's the fucking anger.\n\n56:03.920 --> 56:11.040\nI'm a part of the fucking diamond right now, so, so Frito, this is all just the story that\n\n56:11.040 --> 56:14.080\nI'm just telling you how cool Frito is who you bet.\n\n56:14.080 --> 56:25.080\nSo for fucking Frito hung out in the fucking snow and ice in Milwaukee while I, in my fire,\n\n56:25.080 --> 56:31.720\nmy mom's firebird, you know, I like that the firebird is the most shocking detail.\n\n56:31.720 --> 56:37.000\nEverything is, any, any specific detail from now on is going to make it only worse.\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:41.600\nI mean, I told this story a lot before because it's, it's, it's the ending is even more amazing\n\n56:41.600 --> 56:46.680\nbecause all I remember is the day, I know, but yeah, yeah, they had sex with their used\n\n56:46.680 --> 56:53.640\nto condom because I'm, I'm a classy, responsible gentleman and it finished and I had the condom\n\n56:53.640 --> 56:55.760\nand I like, I didn't know what to do with it.\n\n56:55.760 --> 56:58.680\nFirst condom, first used condom, I didn't have a little bag.\n\n56:58.680 --> 57:06.000\nYou never masturbated into a condom before you, let's get back to that one, Camille.\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:10.440\nWe're going to table that one until after dance, sir.\n\n57:10.440 --> 57:16.280\nThat reminded me of that, that, that toys movie with Robin Williams with someone goes\n\n57:16.280 --> 57:21.480\nlike, it's floating fake poop, you know, for the bathtub and then a guy goes, come on,\n\n57:21.480 --> 57:28.200\nwe've all done it and everyone looks at them and says, this is a scene, this is, we all\n\n57:28.200 --> 57:35.200\nshit in the tub sometimes.\n\n57:35.200 --> 57:42.240\nCamille's blushing right now.\n\n57:42.240 --> 57:43.240\nSo anyways, I took the condom.\n\n57:43.240 --> 57:44.240\nWhich takes a lot.\n\n57:44.240 --> 57:45.240\nI know.\n\n57:45.240 --> 57:49.960\nThere was a, I believe it was called a moon roof on the car, it was a sunroof that doesn't\n\n57:49.960 --> 57:56.840\nreally open all the way, it just kind of props open about 20 degrees and, and so I, I very\n\n57:56.840 --> 58:04.320\ngracefully like, went, you took the condom and like, I had to chuck it backwards, like\n\n58:04.320 --> 58:07.360\nout the, out the opening of the moonroof.\n\n58:07.360 --> 58:08.360\nDitto winter.\n\n58:08.360 --> 58:12.760\nSo freedom, freedom, freedom, come back in from the snow, fucking friends forever.\n\n58:12.760 --> 58:13.760\nWhere is it?\n\n58:13.760 --> 58:14.760\nWhere is he huddled in a ditch?\n\n58:14.760 --> 58:19.520\nLike, he was actually like, we, he was with a friend of the girls, like we, we, we, we,\n\n58:19.520 --> 58:25.200\nthe girl, my girl, got him a girl, like, like her friend from work.\n\n58:25.200 --> 58:26.680\nWas he making out with this other girl?\n\n58:26.680 --> 58:29.320\nI don't know if they were making out, maybe they're just chatting and smoking.\n\n58:29.320 --> 58:30.960\nI don't know if he got anywhere with her or not.\n\n58:30.960 --> 58:31.960\nI can't remember.\n\n58:31.960 --> 58:32.960\nIt's snowing out, right?\n\n58:32.960 --> 58:33.960\nLike it's cold.\n\n58:33.960 --> 58:34.960\nYeah.\n\n58:34.960 --> 58:38.280\nAnd so, Fredo, get back in and we take everybody home and thank you very much.\n\n58:38.280 --> 58:39.280\nI got school tomorrow.\n\n58:39.280 --> 58:47.680\nI, I, I drive the firebird into the garage, I get out, I go, I stay tiptoe inside, I go\n\n58:47.680 --> 58:53.400\nto sleep, I get, I get up in the morning, go out to the cold garage, just the sub zero\n\n58:53.400 --> 59:00.720\ngarage and, and they're frozen to the roof, but also like, like fucking like amazingly\n\n59:00.720 --> 59:07.080\nlike a, like frozen in a wind sock kind of like, like it wasn't like a crumpled up thing.\n\n59:07.080 --> 59:13.400\nIt was like, it had, it had somehow like the wind had like stretched it and like, like,\n\n59:13.400 --> 59:17.880\nlike, like, like a temple tale, you know, it'd been whipping in the wind probably and\n\n59:17.880 --> 59:26.680\nthen slowly like, yeah, just like this, this, this, this, this, you know, this like green\n\n59:26.680 --> 59:27.680\nantenna.\n\n59:27.680 --> 59:28.680\nYeah.\n\n59:28.680 --> 59:34.280\nIt's a flag memorializing your spent Maiden hood.\n\n59:34.280 --> 59:41.640\nAnd I just looked at the camera and said, it's a living, I risked out so lucky nobody\n\n59:41.640 --> 59:44.040\nelse saw that first, your mom didn't come down.\n\n59:44.040 --> 59:45.040\nYeah.\n\n59:45.040 --> 59:46.040\nOh man.\n\n59:46.040 --> 59:47.040\nBut what would she do?\n\n59:47.040 --> 59:49.400\nWhat would she, she wouldn't touch it.\n\n59:49.400 --> 59:50.400\nShe'd be like, what's this?\n\n59:50.400 --> 59:56.400\nAnd I would go, mom, that's it.\n\n59:56.400 --> 59:57.400\nWhat do you think?\n\n59:57.400 --> 59:58.400\nGun to your head, mom.\n\n59:58.400 --> 59:59.400\nWhat do you think?\n\n59:59.400 --> 01:00:08.080\nThat's like when my mom found weed in my clothes pocket, I was home from, I came home\n\n01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:13.560\nto do my laundry, like a good 20 year old, 20, 20, early 20s guy and my mom was like\n\n01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:19.440\ngoing through my laundry, like I found and pulled out this baggie from one of my pockets.\n\n01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440\nWhat's this?\n\n01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:31.200\nAnd I said, that's what you get for going through laundry.\n\n01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.960\nNow you know, I'll explain the condom thing.\n\n01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:35.960\nOkay.\n\n01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:47.680\nI mean, if your whole life, the only way you've come is with feeling your own hand every\n\n01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.560\nnow and then you want to feel something else.\n\n01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.600\nSo I would sometimes wear a condom because it would, it feels different because it was\n\n01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.600\nlubricated.\n\n01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.600\nYeah.\n\n01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.600\nLubricated.\n\n01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.800\nI'm not a monster.\n\n01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.600\nI'm sure, I'm sure I've tried it.\n\n01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.200\nI don't recall, but I guarantee you.\n\n01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.000\nI did a pretty high concept shit in my time.\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nWait.\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.800\nI do think I remember like, I remember putting one on because I was like, holy shit, condom.\n\n01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.800\nI'd never put one on.\n\n01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.800\nIt feels great.\n\n01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:20.400\nI remember putting a condom on and being like, this feels as good as sex feels, I bet.\n\n01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.640\nI was wrong.\n\n01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.920\nThere was way more.\n\n01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.520\nHe had a really good condom.\n\n01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.520\nYeah.\n\n01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.520\nIt was too tight.\n\n01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:32.680\nWhat do you want me to say?\n\n01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:39.680\nLet's bring out condom expert Spencer Crittenden.\n\n01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:46.920\nHey guys, what's up?\n\n01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920\nHey Spencer.\n\n01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.240\nThat's a snazzy podium.\n\n01:01:49.240 -->

01:01:56.000\nIt's from Dharma.\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.880\nIt's, there's a bunch of props from the Lost TV show at Meltdown.\n\n01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:04.240\nAnd this is obviously one of them from the Lost TV show.\n\n01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240\nYeah.\n\n01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.600\nThe, the desk in there, if that's the same one is a from the set and it has Dharma logo\n\n01:02:09.600

with Dharma, but those, the symbol with those sticks being\n\n01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:33.000\nradiated like in an eight, like an octagram that's a, that's like also an E Ching sort\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nof thing.\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nHmm.\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nThe book of changes.\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nBook of changes.\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nNo, no big deal.\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.400\nIt's like a vocal tumor.\n\n01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:46.800\nSo you know, you guys, this is my hundredth episode on this podcast.\n\n01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:52.760\nOh, syndication, baby.\n\n01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.000\nI don't want to be shitty, but it's not really the hundredth episode because you have

for, um, for a kind of box\n\n01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.560\nset that we're going to offer people.\n\n01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.560\nYeah.\n\n01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.560\nYeah.\n\n01:03:33.560 -->

here.\n\n01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:37.480\nAnd I'm thinking, first of all, wrong, uh, you, you don't even know everything about\n\n01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.480\nmy ass.\n\n01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.960\nI have, I have a fucking hemorrhoids.\n\n01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.560\nI like to beat the band.\n\n01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:46.640\nUm, second of all, what part of heartburn don't you understand?\n\n01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.640\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.040\nWhy is there a finger in my ass?\n\n01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:55.440\nMy chest hurts.\n\n01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:58.440\nThe way to a man's heart.\n\n01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:02.440\nGod, I fucking can't lose tonight.\n\n01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:06.320\nThis is really my night.\n\n01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.120\nAnd then he gave me a prescription of something that I never actually went and got.\n\n01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.440\nI hear, no, he gave me, he gave me another referral to a different guy.\n\n01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.920\nI was like, I'm not doing this anymore.\n\n01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.920\nIt's like fire in the sky.\n\n01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.920\nI want you to go see my friend Tony.\n\n01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.920\nHe lives in West Hall.\n\n01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.920\nGive him this note.\n\n01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.920\nDon't open it.\n\n01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920\nYeah.\n\n01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920\nYeah.\n\n01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.920\nI go to Tony and Tony's like reading it.\n\n01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.920\nCome downstairs.\n\n01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.920\nYeah.\n\n01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.920\nLay down sideways.\n\n01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920\nYeah.\n\n01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.920\nYeah.\n\n01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.920\nIt's a side.\n\n01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.920\nIt's a side.\n\n01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920\nHe's called me doctor.\n\n01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.920\nWow.\n\n01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:43.720\nWhat could possibly, what could you possibly find a value in there about my heartburn?\n\n01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.720\nIt's all part of the same gastrointestinal.\n\n01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.720\nIt's all, we're all the same thing.\n\n01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.720\nYour mouth is a direct line to your butt.\n\n01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.720\nYeah.\n\n01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.720\nI know that.\n\n01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.720\nBut, but it's, my mouth's closer to where it hurts.\n\n01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.720\nLike, and the butt is where the poop comes out.\n\n01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.720\nYeah.\n\n01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:03.720\nBut maybe something's getting happening in there and it's like moving shit back up.\n\n01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.720\nLike I put up, like I put bad food up my butt.\n\n01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.720\nLike, no, like bad food got maybe stuck close to your butt.\n\n01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720\nAnd we'll be right back.\n\n01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.720\nThe beginnings.\n\n01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.720\nThis is the beginnings of medicine, by the way.\n\n01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:20.720\nLike maybe some bad food got stuck up your butt, on the way out your butt.\n\n01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.720\nAnd it's causing, it's sending a signal to you or where your heartburn is happening.\n\n01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.720\nWe gotta, we gotta have Schrab here.\n\n01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.720\nSorry.\n\n01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.720\nAnother hand comes up and I'm very fascinated about this.\n\n01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.720\nThis is probably called, called loss of opportunity.\n\n01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.720\nLoss of opportunity?\n\n01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:34.720\nYeah.\n\n01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.720\nIt's something legal.\n\n01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:43.720\nYou know, if you've got prostate cancer and the guy doesn't examine a year or two from now,\n\n01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.720\nhe's hooked up.\n\n01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:50.720\nOh, so you were saying that maybe heartburn and one of the symptoms of prostate cancer\n\n01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.720\nis heartburn, so he had to.\n\n01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.720\nNo.\n\n01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.720\nThat's not what you're saying.\n\n01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.720\nCome up here and get a mic if you're going to talk for a bit.\n\n01:07:58.720 --> 01:07:59.720\nI'm curious about this.\n\n01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.720\nYou're saying it's a legal thing.\n\n01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.720\nLike, oh, I went to a guy for heartburn two years ago and now I got prostate cancer\n\n01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.720\nand he should have put a finger at my butt.\n\n01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:07.720\nYeah.\n\n01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.720\nThere's a microphone.\n\n01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.720\nYou see.\n\n01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.720\nYeah.\n\n01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:18.720\nTotal pro, great move.\n\n01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.720\nAll right.\n\n01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:26.720\nNow wisdom.\n\n01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:33.720\nOkay, so if you get prostate cancer and two years from now, you're really fucked up.\n\n01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:41.720\nAnd no doctor has seen it and they check your records and they see that you went to a doctor\n\n01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:47.720\ntwo years ago and that he could have examined you and he didn't.\n\n01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.720\nIs this specifically about prostate cancer or like any sort of?\n\n01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.720\nOr is this like a prostate cancer plot?\n\n01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.720\nIf you go into a doctor, you have a chip tooth or a sore throat and they don't put a finger\n\n01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.720\nat your butt.\n\n01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.720\nThey could be sued for malpractice or malfeasance or something.\n\n01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.720\nYeah, just kind of fucked up because, you know, American medicine and stuff like that.\n\n01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.720\nI have two questions.\n\n01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.720\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.720\nHelder.\n\n01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.720\nHelder.\n\n01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.720\nWhat do you do?\n\n01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.720\nI study medicine.\n\n01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.720\nYou study medicine?\n\n01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.720\nYeah.\n\n01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.720\nOh, good.\n\n01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:17.720\nSo you're going to be a doctor?\n\n01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.720\nSo, yeah.\n\n01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:19.720\nOh, all right.\n\n01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:24.720\nSo, and it all started with you being fascinated by like dead animals and stuff, right?\n\n01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.720\nAnd your dad was like, don't be a serial killer.\n\n01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.720\nGo to medical school.\n\n01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.720\nNo, no.\n\n01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:36.720\nI'm not from here, you know, I'm from Brazil and there, you know, oh, starting.\n\n01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.720\nAll doctors are assholes, major assholes.\n\n01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.720\nSo, let me get this out of the way.\n\n01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.720\nWhat sort of medicine do you want to practice?\n\n01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.720\nI really don't know.\n\n01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.720\nMaybe radiology.\n\n01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.720\nBut radiology is the cushy one.\n\n01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:50.720\nThat's why there's no emergencies.\n\n01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.720\nMy cousin radiologist, you make a lot of money.\n\n01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.720\nThere's no emergencies.\n\n01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.720\nThe hours are easy.\n\n01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:00.720\nYou just sort of look in at x-rays and like text, like lab stuff.\n\n01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.720\nYeah, kind of.\n\n01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.720\nAnd you're constantly exposed to radiation.\n\n01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:04.720\nListen.\n\n01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.720\nWhich can't hurt.\n\n01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:10.720\nI mean, as the old saying goes, radiation can't hurt.\n\n01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:16.720\nSo, are you saying, Helder, just to be clear, this loss of opportunity concept, it's not\n\n01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.720\neven like Jeff said, if I went in with a broken pinky, is that so?\n\n01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.720\nOr is it because it had to do with my internal medicine?\n\n01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.720\nIt didn't have to do with your heartburn, you know.\n\n01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:30.720\nSo, I just got a spine check.\n\n01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.720\nWell, I've been to a doctor and that hasn't happened.\n\n01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.720\nSo, why doesn't that happen every time you go to a doctor?\n\n01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.720\nYou're saying doctors live in fear of not diagnosing prostate cancer.\n\n01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.720\nYeah, it's kind of weird, you know.\n\n01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.720\nBut I really don't know exactly why.\n\n01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.720\nThat's one thing that could happen.\n\n01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.720\nI guess you're just playing the odds.\n\n01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.720\nBy the way, you already sound like a doctor.\n\n01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.720\nI don't know exactly.\n\n01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:54.720\nI mean, that could happen.\n\n01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.720\nJust give me a number, doc.\n\n01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.720\nTell me how long have I got.\n\n01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.720\nThat's why I didn't say anything when you were complaining about your...\n\n01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.720\nWhat do you think it is?\n\n01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.720\nI have no fucking idea.\n\n01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.720\nHow long have you studied medicine, Helder?\n\n01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.720\nSix years.\n\n01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.720\nSix years? What school did you go to?\n\n01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.720\nOr did you go to?\n\n01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.720\nIn Brazil, I studied at a federal university.\n\n01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.720\nDo you live in L.A. now, or are you just visiting?\n\n01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.720\nNo, no, just visiting.\n\n01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.720\nReally? You left Brazil during the World Cup?\n\n01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.720\nYeah.\n\n01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:25.720\nIt's probably a good time to go, right?\n\n01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.720\nSure. Yeah.\n\n01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.720\nYou're just visiting Los Angeles.\n\n01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:30.720\nIs that what you said?\n\n01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.720\nYeah.\n\n01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.720\nOh, okay.\n\n01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:35.720\nSo you thought it's a good time to get out of here with all the tourists are here and stuff?\n\n01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.720\nYeah.\n\n01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.720\nWhat town are you from?\n\n01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.720\nRio.\n\n01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.720\nYeah, so that's probably a good time to be not at home right now.\n\n01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.720\nYeah, Rio is complete chaos.\n\n01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:44.720\nHow do you feel about it?\n\n01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.720\nBecause all the civil unrest and stuff like that,\n\n01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.720\nbecause there was riots leading up to the World Cup.\n\n01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.720\nOh, he's pro.\n\n01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:53.720\nI think like historically, lots of cities,\n\n01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.720\nlike the local population loses a lot.\n\n01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.720\nLike the working class loses a lot.\n\n01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.720\nIt's a bunch of graphs from the top and corporations and contractors get bids and stuff like that.\n\n01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.720\nDoes the average person in Rio hate the World Cup?\n\n01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.720\nAre they happy that it's there?\n\n01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:08.720\nYeah.\n\n01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:15.720\nWell, now that it is happening, people are kind of okay with it because Brazil's playing and crazy.\n\n01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.720\nI have a World Cup question.\n\n01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.720\nI also have one.\n\n01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.720\nAre you a fan of football?\n\n01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.720\nNo.\n\n01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.720\nOkay.\n\n01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:25.720\nHe's here.\n\n01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.720\nWhy is the logo two hands?\n\n01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.720\nHands are like the worst thing in soccer.\n\n01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.720\nYeah.\n\n01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720\nSoccer.\n\n01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.720\nThey hate hands.\n\n01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.720\nThat would be like if the hockey logo was like roller skates.\n\n01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.720\nThe story of it.\n\n01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.720\nOr if a football logo was a chess board.\n\n01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.720\nWell, that trophy now, there's a good documentary about it.\n\n01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.720\nThe trophy now is the world, which is the soccer ball, which is the hands-all holding onto it.\n\n01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:53.720\nThat's not the original one.\n\n01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.720\nThe original one was like stolen and Hitler wanted it and Mussolini stole it for a while.\n\n01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:03.720\nThere was an amazing story about the original trophy, which is this beautiful piece of like art deco,\n\n01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:06.720\nart gold, and it was really wonderful.\n\n01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.720\nAnd it was probably the most coveted trophy that will ever be because it was first of all beautiful.\n\n01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.720\nAnd second of all, it's the World Cup, which is the most important thing for most athletes.\n\n01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.720\nAnd we don't know where it is, but for a while Mussolini had it,\n\n01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.720\nand Hitler tried to steal it and shit like that.\n\n01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:22.720\nIt's really good.\n\n01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.720\nHitler loved art.\n\n01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.720\nI saw that movie.\n\n01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:31.720\nHe was going to build a big Hitler museum with all the art and all the world in it.\n\n01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.720\nIs this the John Cusack one?\n\n01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.720\nMonuments, man.\n\n01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:36.720\nIs John Cusack in that?\n\n01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.720\nI can't even remember.\n\n01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:38.720\nEveryone was in it.\n\n01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:39.720\nNo, George Clooney.\n\n01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.720\nWhat's the one with young Hitler?\n\n01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.720\nOh, that's called Max.\n\n01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:44.720\nWait, what is it called?\n\n01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:45.720\nMax?\n\n01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.720\nYeah.\n\n01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:47.720\nI told you this podcast.\n\n01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:52.720\nI recommend viewing that because it's like very dramatic.\n\n01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.720\nI don't know.\n\n01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.720\nI don't think it's trying to...\n\n01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:59.720\nI don't think you can make a movie about Hitler and not have a big dramatic.\n\n01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:04.720\nBut it's like, I mean, if you want to see John Cusack pointing at a guy poking him in the chest\n\n01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:06.720\nand saying, from your heart, Hitler!\n\n01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:10.720\nI want to see it on the canvas, Hitler!\n\n01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.720\nIt's just funny.\n\n01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.720\nIt's like, the world will be my canvas.\n\n01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.720\nI have a football question.\n\n01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720\nWhat?\n\n01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.720\nDo you guys not know what he did?\n\n01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.720\nToo soon, man.\n\n01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.720\nThe story ends badly.\n\n01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:29.720\nThe other question, Spencer and I were talking about this on Twitter.\n\n01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.720\nOkay, the hardest thing about watching football is soccer.\n\n01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.720\nYou don't know how...\n\n01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.720\nAt 90 minutes, the game is not over.\n\n01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.720\nAt 90 minutes, they're like, now we're going to play for a random amount of time.\n\n01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.720\nAs long as I feel.\n\n01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:45.720\nWhy do you even have a clock?\n\n01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:46.720\nIt's not random.\n\n01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.720\nI know it's injury time.\n\n01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.720\nIt's kind of random.\n\n01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.720\nI know it's not.\n\n01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.720\nWhy don't they just pause the clock so that it's always 90?\n\n01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.720\nThat's what all the other sports are doing.\n\n01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.720\nWhy is the time going when they're fucking around?\n\n01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.720\nWhen they're pretending to be hit.\n\n01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.720\nThey don't want to stop the clock because they don't want to...\n\n01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.720\nIf you stop the clock like today, they stop you.\n\n01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.720\nYou've got to use your hands.\n\n01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.720\nNo!\n\n01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.720\nNo!\n\n01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.720\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.720\nThat's why they can't stop the clock.\n\n01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:09.720\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.720\nThey hate hands.\n\n01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.720\nEach time there's an injury, there's a guy trying to kick a clock.\n\n01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.720\nAnd it won't work.\n\n01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.720\nYou've got to make a foot clock.\n\n01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.720\nThe hardest to work a stopwatch with your feet.\n\n01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.720\nYeah.\n\n01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:24.720\nThat's the best explanation I've heard.\n\n01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.720\nBut why don't they just pause the fucking clock?\n\n01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:31.720\nToday, during Mexico Netherlands, they stopped the clock for a water break because it was\n\n01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.720\nlike 97 degrees or whatever and they stopped it for the second time.\n\n01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:35.720\nBut they can't do it.\n\n01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.720\nThey know how to.\n\n01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.720\nThe second time in World Cup history, they stopped it for a water break, for a refreshment\n\n01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.720\nbreak and they went to commercial and it was really a bummer.\n\n01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:46.720\nThe one thing that you can dig about soccer or international football is that you don't\n\n01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:48.720\nsee a bunch of fucking commercials.\n\n01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:51.720\nThey had a water break and they went to commercial and it was a big drag.\n\n01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.720\nWhy don't they just hit pause?\n\n01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.720\nIt's not wide so then we know when the game's over.\n\n01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.720\nThe players are playing like, we have a random amount of time left to score.\n\n01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.720\nWouldn't it be better if they knew exactly how much time they had left?\n\n01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.720\nWhy?\n\n01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:16.720\nWhy would it be worse if they knew exactly how much time they had left?\n\n01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.720\nThere's a lot of corruption in soccer.\n\n01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.720\nThere's a lot of corruption in soccer is how the explanation is starting.\n\n01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.720\nFIFA's like Chicago politics from the 1800s.\n\n01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.720\nWe don't have to go so far back.\n\n01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:33.720\nOne is to see how bad of a person you are, how bad of a team you are.\n\n01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.720\nIt seems like Italy they just flop around.\n\n01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.720\nThis has nothing to do with the question.\n\n01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.720\nNo, it does with the clock.\n\n01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.720\nYeah, they like hammer it up.\n\n01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.720\nThey waste time.\n\n01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:47.720\nIf you know it's 90 minutes, we're ahead by two goals.\n\n01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.720\nWe're just going to eat up the clock and lay on the ground or do a bunch of shit.\n\n01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.720\nNow the referee says no.\n\n01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.720\nYou want to lay on the ground.\n\n01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:55.720\nYou lay on the ground then we can...\n\n01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.720\nI don't know.\n\n01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.720\nFor me, it is a weird thing.\n\n01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.720\nThere's no other sport that's like, the game will end.\n\n01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.720\nOh, it ends.\n\n01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.720\nWho the fuck knows?\n\n01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.720\nI think there's about five minutes left.\n\n01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:12.720\nThere was a piece, I think it was New York Times, something like that I saw,\n\n01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:15.720\nthat ranked the countries by how much time they spent on the ground,\n\n01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:17.720\nwrithing in fake agony.\n\n01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.720\nAnd it's so interesting.\n\n01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.720\nBut the team that won today, the beat Mexico, the Netherlands,\n\n01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.720\nthey weren't even in the top 20, I don't think.\n\n01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.720\nThey just do not flop and don't spend time writhing around on the ground.\n\n01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.720\nBrazil, number one.\n\n01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:33.720\nBecause South American teams, Central American teams,\n\n01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.720\nand also parts of like the Spanish leagues, Italian leagues,\n\n01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.720\nthere's a big culture of just fucking like...\n\n01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:42.720\nThere's a great thing on YouTube where there's people doing flops\n\n01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.720\nand they have like a crosshairs, like a sniper.\n\n01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.720\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:46.720\nI saw that.\n\n01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.720\nThere's people going, oh, falling down.\n\n01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:51.720\nThere's a crosshairs and a bullet, the sound goes off.\n\n01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:54.720\nThere's no one anywhere near them, it's really good.\n\n01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:56.720\nOkay, so because they flop...\n\n01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.720\nThat's just another aspect of the game, right, is what you're saying?\n\n01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.720\nIt's like its own kind of...\n\n01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.720\nNo, but I don't get how that has to do with the clock.\n\n01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.720\nWell, I mean, you have actual injuries that happen in soccer,\n\n01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.720\nso that's why you have to extra time.\n\n01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.720\nThat's why it's added on when...\n\n01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.720\nBut why don't they just pause when the injuries happen?\n\n01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.720\nBecause then I think people would use...\n\n01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.720\nThe ball's really never dead, like there's not like a lot of dead ball situations,\n\n01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.720\nlike in basketball where the whistle blows and there's lots of breaks\n\n01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:23.720\nand everyone has a drink of water.\n\n01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.720\nIn soccer, you just play, you keep going.\n\n01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.720\nIt's fucking amazing.\n\n01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.720\nIf you watch NBA or college, in the last few minutes,\n\n01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.720\nit's nothing but commercials.\n\n01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.720\nNo, it's great, but why don't they just pause the clock?\n\n01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.720\nThey don't have to...\n\n01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.720\nThey have commercials.\n\n01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.720\nThat's such a...\n\n01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:38.720\nThat's a false dichotomy.\n\n01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:39.720\nYou don't...\n\n01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.720\nYou don't...\n\n01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.720\nThe alternative isn't, I guess we're going to have to buy a lot of commercials\n\n01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.720\nand shove them into these breaks.\n\n01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.720\nYeah.\n\n01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:49.720\nI'm not even saying breaks where someone falls down.\n\n01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.720\nYou play for 45 minutes and if there's been an injury\n\n01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.720\nor if there's been lots of substitutions, they add 30 seconds for this,\n\n01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.720\na minute for that and they add it up and...\n\n01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.720\nAnd nobody knows what that number is.\n\n01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.720\nThe officials do.\n\n01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.720\nThere's one guy.\n\n01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.720\nThe fourth official saying that we're going to give you 30 seconds\n\n01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.720\nfor the substitution, 30 seconds for this penalty kick,\n\n01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.720\na minute for that injury.\n\n01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:11.720\nThe officials know, but game not recognized clock.\n\n01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:16.720\nWow.\n\n01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:19.720\nWorld's best callback.\n\n01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.720\nThat was sitting on that egg for 10 minutes.\n\n01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.720\nThat was a world cup of callbacks.\n\n01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:29.720\nSo, Dr. Tumer is raising his hand.\n\n01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.720\nThe real answer is like FIFA has never been known for embracing change.\n\n01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:35.720\nFIFA doesn't embrace change.\n\n01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.720\nIt took a point of while to embrace goal line technology.\n\n01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.720\nGoal line technology?\n\n01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:43.720\nWhy are you guys talking about this?\n\n01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.720\nYou just walked in, sir.\n\n01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.720\nI saw you walk in.\n\n01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.720\nWe're at a show.\n\n01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:51.720\nI had to get a drink.\n\n01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:52.720\nOkay.\n\n01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.720\nSo, you had to get up and get a drink,\n\n01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.720\nbut now we're doing the show wrong because you came back in\n\n01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.720\nand we're talking about soccer, not to your liking.\n\n01:19:58.720 --> 01:19:59.720\nBut you're talking about it wrong.\n\n01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.720\nOh.\n\n01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.720\nWho's this fancy gentleman?\n\n01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.720\nIt's like I had a linen suit.\n\n01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:06.720\nI know.\n\n01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.720\nI know he likes to drink.\n\n01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.720\nYes, in the front row?\n\n01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:11.720\nYou're right.\n\n01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.720\nYou're more virginity losing story.\n\n01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:18.720\nWell, there can be only one.\n\n01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.720\nNo, I've got screen.\n\n01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:24.720\nThat was my only condom virginity.\n\n01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.720\nMy couch virginity.\n\n01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.720\nWhich is just me fucking couching.\n\n01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.720\nWe were watching...\n\n01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:33.720\nWhat was your cantaloupe virginity?\n\n01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:36.720\nHow old were you during the first cantaloupe you fucked?\n\n01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:39.720\nAre we talking honeydew, watermelon?\n\n01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.720\nCantaloupe.\n\n01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:42.720\nBecause I was a hell of a honeydew.\n\n01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:43.720\nOh, dear God.\n\n01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:46.720\nWe were watching a documentary about this church quiz\n\n01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.720\nthat these kids do.\n\n01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.720\nThere's all these Christian teens are talking about.\n\n01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:51.720\nOne of them was saying,\n\n01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.720\nI haven't kissed a boy yet,\n\n01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.720\nbut I lost my hand genity two years ago.\n\n01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.720\nAnd Aaron and I thought,\n\n01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.720\nwe're like, Aaron was so...\n\n01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.720\nShe's like, he won't let you kiss him,\n\n01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.720\nbut he made you jerk him off in a car?\n\n01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.720\nLike, what kind of fucked up shit?\n\n01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.720\nAnd it was like, it was ten minutes later\n\n01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:10.720\nthat we figured out that she meant...\n\n01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:11.720\nThe masturbation?\n\n01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:12.720\nNo, that she held...\n\n01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.720\nHolding hands with a boy.\n\n01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:15.720\nWhat?\n\n01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.720\nThat's fucking disturbing.\n\n01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:20.720\nOh, wow.\n\n01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.720\nWe immediately thought she meant hand job.\n\n01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:23.720\nYeah, that she fucking...\n\n01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.720\nI thought masturbation.\n\n01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.720\nAnyway, so speaking of Aaron,\n\n01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:29.720\nshe's not here tonight.\n\n01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.720\nHelder, would you be willing to play?\n\n01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.720\nDo you ever listen to the podcast?\n\n01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:36.720\nIf you listen to us play Dungeons & Dragons?\n\n01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.720\nNo, but have you heard us play it?\n\n01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.720\nLike, you

the...\n\n01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.720\nI think the new season of Drunk History,\n\n01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.720\nwhich she's a part of,\n\n01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.720\nher episode has got\n\n01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:56.720\nJohn Lithgow and Chris Parnell and Winona Ryder.\n\n01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.720\nWhat a name, wow.\n\n01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.720\nI haven't seen it, but I'm

Arnold.\n\n01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.720\nAnd I heard that which...\n\n01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.720\nI think she was telling me,\n\n01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:12.720\nWeird Elle Yankovic plays Hitler this season.\n\n01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:14.720\nThat's great.\n\n01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.720\nYeah, somebody tells a story about\n\n01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.720\nHitler and Weird Elle Yankovic.\n\n01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.720\nDoes he cut his hair off?\n\n01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:21.720\nThat's what I asked, and then Aaron mocked me\n\n01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:22.720\nand said, you know, they have these things\n\n01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:23.720\ncalled wigs, and I was like,\n\n01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.720\nyou can't make long hair into short hair\n\n01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.720\nwith a wig, and she said, yes you can.\n\n01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.720\nHe's got too much hair to put a fucking\n\n01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.720\nlike a Hitler hair on.\n\n01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.720\nMaybe he cut it.\n\n01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.720\nMaybe that'll be Weird Elle's new look,\n\n01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.720\nbecause he kind of never went back\n\n01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.720\nfrom his Qui-John hair.\n\n01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.720\nHe kind of did that, and then he was like...\n\n01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.720\nQui-John?\n\n01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:43.720\nWas it like Qui-Gon?\n\n01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.720\nQui-Gon Gin?\n\n01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:45.720\nOh, okay.\n\n01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.720\nI don't know.\n\n01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.720\nAnyways, whatever.\n\n01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:48.720\nShe's not here.\n\n01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.720\nWe're replacing her with a...\n\n01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:50.720\nSpencer, will you hand this out to Dan?\n\n01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.720\nYou want to pass down the character sheets?\n\n01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:53.720\nYeah.\n\n01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.720\nYeah.\n\n01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.720\nI am kind of interested in finding out\n\n01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.720\nwhy that guy was saying we were talking about it wrong.\n\n01:22:58.720 --> 01:22:59.720\nHe didn't like to hear about sports.\n\n01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:00.720\nHe was trying to...\n\n01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.720\nHe seems like bad news to me.\n\n01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:06.720\nMaybe we were using our hands too much.\n\n01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:11.720\nBut I will say, I did also wonder\n\n01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.720\nwhy we were talking about soccer for like 30 minutes.\n\n01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:15.720\nI fucking like soccer.\n\n01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.720\nAlso, I bet some...\n\n01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:17.720\nSomeone's got to...\n\n01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.720\nI bet a guy a hundred dollars,\n\n01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.720\nbecause he's being an asshole.\n\n01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.720\nI bet a guy a hundred bucks on the\n\n01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.720\nMexico Netherlands game.\n\n01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:24.720\nI never bet on sports.\n\n01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.720\nI'll never do it again, because it was stupid.\n\n01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.720\nI'm not rooting against Mexico.\n\n01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.720\nBut this guy was just being an asshole,\n\n01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.720\nso I bet him I didn't get his name\n\n01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.720\nand I'll never see him again.\n\n01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.720\nI have no idea who it was.\n\n01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:35.720\nAnd I guarantee...\n\n01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:38.720\nDid you meet him at an airport?\n\n01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:39.720\nIf you were at an airport,\n\n01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.720\nyou would have gotten this phone number.\n\n01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.720\nYou've never just...\n\n01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.720\nYou've never met people at a bar?\n\n01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.720\nYou've never just struck up conversation with people?\n\n01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:45.720\nI've never just talked to random...\n\n01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.720\nIf people start talking to me,\n\n01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.720\nI'm like, what the fuck do you want?\n\n01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:52.720\nI don't have it.\n\n01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:53.720\nI'm going, people ask me anything.\n\n01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:54.720\nI don't have it.\n\n01:23:54.720 -->

--> 01:24:00.720\nand it's very fascinating to me.\n\n01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:01.720\nI agree.\n\n01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.720\nI agree.\n\n01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.720\nIf somebody starts chatting me up,\n\n01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.720\nI won't hold the shoulder in public,\n\n01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:10.720\nbut yeah, I don't...\n\n01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.720\nEmily will do this on an airplane.\n\n01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:13.720\nShe has this rule,\n\n01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.720\nso it was me, it was me in the aisle,\n\n01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:16.720\nher in the middle,\n\n01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.720\nand the person at this old lady at the window.\n\n01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.720\nAnd we sat down and she's like,\n\n01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.720\nyou have to right away establish\n\n01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.720\nwhat the tone is going to be.\n\n01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.720\nSo this lady looked at Emily and was like,\n\n01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:27.720\nwhere are you going?\n\n01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:29.720\nAnd Emily just sat there stone-faced,\n\n01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:32.720\nand the old lady asked her three times,\n\n01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.720\nand Emily just fucking bitter-lip\n\n01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.720\nand was like, I'm going to power through this,\n\n01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.720\nsaid nothing, and it was a great flight.\n\n01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.720\nNot for the old lady.\n\n01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.720\nNot for that lady.\n\n01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:46.720\nWho gives a fuck what the old lady

striking up conversations.\n\n01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.720\nYou're the problem, you're that guy.\n\n01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:04.720\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.720\nOn a flight, on a flight,\n\n01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.720\nI don't want jibber jabber.\n\n01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.720\nI don't want to be like, hey, it's cool.\n\n01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:10.720\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:11.720\nOn the plane,\n\n01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.720\nI want absolute fucking graveyard silence on a flight.\n\n01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:14.720\nRight, okay,

do that.\n\n01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.720\nBut sometimes conversation comes up,\n\n01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.720\nand you find out that people are just having a good old time.\n\n01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.720\nYeah.\n\n01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.720\nYeah, see?\n\n01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:30.720\nSome people are curious about the people sitting next to them.\n\n01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:33.720\nAnd also, I could not care less.\n\n01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.720\nBut you're a comedian.\n\n01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:38.720\nWouldn't you benefit from mining,\n\n01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.720\nlike human experiences?\n\n01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.720\nYeah, no, I talked to a guy once,\n\n01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.720\nand I got three hours of material out of it.\n\n01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.720\nYou're a fucking sociopath.\n\n01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:53.720\nI'm not saying you go up there and you grab everybody's ass,\n\n01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.720\nit's not seeing you fucking harangue.\n\n01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.720\nSometimes conversation starts.\n\n01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:58.720\nI actively block them.\n\n01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.720\nI swat away attempts at conversation.\n\n01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:01.720\nA hundred percent.\n\n01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.720\nThat doesn't seem like you.\n\n01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.720\nYou're a very garrulous, like chatty guy.\n\n01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:08.720\nYeah, but not with fucking people I don't know.\n\n01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.720\nLike, Helder, you're a great guy.\n\n01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.720\nIf you sat up next to me and were like, what's up?\n\n01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.720\nI would like just fucking stare straight in front of me\n\n01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.720\nuntil you left.\n\n01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.720\nWhat's up?\n\n01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.720\nHe wouldn't say it, see?\n\n01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.720\nGreat.\n\n01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.720\nI don't get it.\n\n01:26:25.720 -->

street,\n\n01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:43.720\nChristmas day, or Christmas Eve day,\n\n01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.720\nI'm walking down the road and I see her father outside.\n\n01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:47.720\nAnd I see him, I'm leaving him.\n\n01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.720\nI want to go get Kate a little gift and have breakfast on my own.\n\n01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:51.720\nAnd I come back and

--> 01:46:25.720\nA very controlled fireball.\n\n01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.720\nYou're going to light\n\n01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:29.720\nsomething on fire again, huh?\n\n01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.720\nHow close are you guys\n\n01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:33.720\nto this wall?\n\n01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:35.720\nI'm not going to shoot it\n\n01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:37.720\nif my friends are standing there.\n\n01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:39.720\nEverybody back up.\n\n01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:41.720\nWe're going to do try something.\n\n01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.720\nWe instinctively move away from this fireball.\n\n01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:45.720\nAll right.\n\n01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.720\nYou launch a fireball.\n\n01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:49.720\nIt's very hard.\n\n01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:51.720\nIt does hit.\n\n01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:53.720\nNobody was wringing it.\n\n01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:55.720\nIt hits.\n\n01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:57.720\nIt immediately starts catching\n\n01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:59.720\nfire from the fireball\n\n01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:01.720\nand it spreads in all directions.\n\n01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:05.720\nYou're welcome.\n\n01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.720\nWe do what we do.\n\n01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:11.720\nWe're really going to get out of here\n\n01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:13.720\nor I'll go to jail.\n\n01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:15.720\nThe wall continues to burn, spreading out\n\n01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:17.720\nand you see it starts to catch on fire\n\n01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:19.720\nsome of the buildings nearby\n\n01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.720\nwhere you guys are\n\n01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.720\nthat are touching the wall.\n\n01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:25.720\nI'm like, hey, who set the wall on fire?\n\n01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:29.720\nI think we're good.\n\n01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:31.720\nBehind this wall, you see another wall.\n\n01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:33.720\nIt's very similar,\n\n01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:35.720\nI'd call it like a maroon color.\n\n01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:37.720\nBut it's also\n\n01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.720\nthe same fibrous material.\n\n01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.720\nBut it's not on fire from this fire?\n\n01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:43.720\nNo, it's kind of like\n\n01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:45.720\nas this wall is burning away, it's revealing\n\n01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:47.720\nthis kind of different wall, if that makes sense.\n\n01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:49.720\nI think we all know what to do, guys.\n\n01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:53.720\nSatay on fire.\n\n01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:57.720\nLightning bolt.\n\n01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:59.720\nAll right.\n\n01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:01.720\nYou blast it with the lightning bolt\n\n01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:03.720\nwhich scorches a small pinpoint\n\n01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.720\nbut it doesn't continue on fire.\n\n01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:07.720\nCan I go look in the hole\n\n01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:09.720\nto see what's on the other side?\n\n01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.720\nYeah, you look in\n\n01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:13.720\nyour eye is instantly bitten\n\n01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.720\nnot by bites, but by cold.\n\n01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:19.720\nFrost taints your eye\n\n01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:21.720\nwith its coldy grip\n\n01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:23.720\nas you look and see nothing but white\n\n01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:25.720\nwhite light all around you\n\n01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:27.720\nand then you get hit in the eye by something.\n\n01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.720\nIt's snow.\n\n01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:31.720\nIt's a piece of snow hits you in the eye.\n\n01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:33.720\nShit.\n\n01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:35.720\nPiece of snow?\n\n01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:37.720\nI think they call it a flake.\n\n01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:39.720\nRight?\n\n01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:41.720\nYeah.\n\n01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:43.720\nSnowflake.\n\n01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:45.720\nIt hits you in the eye.\n\n01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:47.720\nHow much damage does it take?\n\n01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.720\nYou notice it, tangibly.\n\n01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:51.720\nIt's just a snowflake.\n\n01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.720\nIt's not painful.\n\n01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:55.720\nAll right, so we got one wall,\n\n01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.720\nsystem is a statue when it's on fire\n\n01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.720\nand then there's the maroon wall\n\n01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:01.720\nthat is impervious to lightning strike.\n\n01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:03.720\nWell, but we could\n\n01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:05.720\nalso try and set it on fire.\n\n01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:07.720\nWell, it wasn't impervious.\n\n01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:09.720\nIt didn't do much damage to it\n\n01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:11.720\nand then beyond that it's just snow, snowtown, USA.\n\n01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.720\nI don't like it.\n\n01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:17.720\nIf we're in a tundra, we can't just walk away.\n\n01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:19.720\nThe fire on the other parts\n\n01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:21.720\nof the wall continue burning\n\n01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.720\nand spreading on fire more.\n\n01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:25.720\nI don't think we can hang out here.\n\n01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:29.720\nAnd we're not going to get a lot of help\n\n01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:31.720\nfrom the locals.\n\n01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.720\nI mean, they really should not help.\n\n01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.720\nI look around for that bag\n\n01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.720\nthat we came in through.\n\n01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:39.720\nYou still don't see it.\n\n01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:41.720\nSmoke clouds your vision.\n\n01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.720\nWe should have done that before.\n\n01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:45.720\nWe set the wall on fire.\n\n01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:47.720\nEverybody spread out and look for that bag\n\n01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.720\nthat we came in through.\n\n01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:51.720\nI really look for it.\n\n01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.720\nAll right.\n\n01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.720\nSharpie, you see it's a small box.\n\n01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.720\nIt just catches your eye.\n\n01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:59.720\nI got a box over here.\n\n01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:01.720\nThe rest of you find nothing of value.\n\n01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:03.720\nJohn Doe has the upper hand.\n\n01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:07.720\nWhat's in the box?\n\n01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.720\nWhat's in the box?\n\n01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:15.720\nThat's Nick Cage.\n\n01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.720\nI open it carefully with my switchblade.\n\n01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:19.720\nYou open the box and you see,\n\n01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:21.720\nit's just a ton of cigarettes.\n\n01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:23.720\nI dump them out.\n\n01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:25.720\nAll right.\n\n01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:29.720\nCigarettes litter the floor.\n\n01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:33.720\nI keep looking for the bag.\n\n01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:35.720\nYou don't find anything.\n\n01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:37.720\nWhat do I find?\n\n01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:39.720\nYou guys didn't

smoke.\n\n01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:47.720\nWasn't there one guy who wanted cigarettes?\n\n01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:49.720\nRemember him?\n\n01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:51.720\nYeah, so we murdered
