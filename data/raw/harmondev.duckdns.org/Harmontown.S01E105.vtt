00:00.000 --> 00:22.000
I hear music and there's no one there. Smell blossoms and the trees are back. All night long I'm walking on air. I wonder why. I wonder why.

00:22.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello everybody, from Hollywood, California, and Meltdown Comics, the Nerdist Theater. Harmon Sound is now in session. Please. Oh shit. Oh my god.

00:38.000 --> 00:59.000
Tonight's attendance, 40,000 people. I love it. I love it. I love it. Please welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:59.000 --> 01:09.000
Thank you. What a crowd. I don't know. What is it? I guess it's a million people. What's going on? Is there a convention? I think it's the World Cup. They have World Cup people.

01:09.000 --> 01:22.000
They heard my World Cup coverage and they're like, okay, well, I'm sure it's unrelated but I was just getting some statistics. Some people like to celebrate this stuff.

01:22.000 --> 01:41.000
I got into podcasting to forget about numbers. I'm fleeing a world too obsessed with ratings and things. I come here to not pay attention to these things. However, Harmontown, but when we went out on tour, I don't know, we used to get like 60,000 to 80,000 downloads per episode.

01:41.000 --> 02:03.000
Now we're up to like 100,000 per episode. We had a million total when we went on that tour where we made that movie that no one ever gets to see. Now we just passed, I was told in the green room, 10 million downloads total.

02:03.000 --> 02:15.000
But I'm sure a lot of people download them multiple times. I don't know. I don't know what you kids do. This is for freezes. We don't care. We don't care about no numbers.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
I want to talk more about my giant new podium here. This is really exciting.

02:19.000 --> 02:34.000
Yeah, just got a new podium. It looks like a 56 Buick. It's got a big light on the front with a logo we'll have to swap out for our own. Yeah, it's pretty great. I like this.

02:34.000 --> 02:43.000
Alright, so what are we going to talk about? I just started doing couples therapy. It's a marriage pre-marriage counseling. You and Rob?

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
It's a long time coming.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
No, Erin and I are, you know, we want to make sure the ship's all airtight before we take it out to the sea.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Am I right in recalling that she called it engagement camp?

02:58.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah, well, the counselor offers a six week program that she calls marriage camp or something like that. But after our consultation, she's like, I don't know, you know, maybe you guys should do this for a long time.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
Maybe not so much a camp as like a condo.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Let's TP more of an asylum. How many have you been to?

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Just one. There was one consultation and then we just had our first one on Friday.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Tell me, I'm very curious about that.

03:30.000 --> 03:52.000
I'm really, it's really, it's pretty great. I think the most important thing is to have language, because as we all know relationships, the big obstacle for them is that they're competing in their most crucial phases with something that you can't compete with,

03:52.000 --> 04:03.000
which is the courtship phase, where there's hormones, the chemicals pumping through your body, looking at this person across the room, you know, the whole high fidelity monologue with John Cusack.

04:03.000 --> 04:16.000
It's like, you know, when your, when your lover is a stranger to you and you're, you just love drinking a big glass of water of how you look in their eyes and everything is fantastic.

04:16.000 --> 04:25.000
It's like, then you seal a deal and that's when the really rewarding stuff starts to happen, like a 30 year life together, for instance.

04:25.000 --> 04:36.000
But at the same time, the big problem with that is that, you know, you can sometimes feel like, like, well, it's like, well, now I don't, now I'm not on fire all the time.

04:36.000 --> 04:46.000
Like, now we're actually, now you know what a shitty person I am. Now we fight sometimes and then the person I had that fight with is still there, you know.

04:46.000 --> 04:55.000
It's not like you're getting a fight and you're like, I don't want to see you anymore. It's like, we got in a fight and now I'm going to keep seeing you forever because I love you, but we had like eight fights.

04:55.000 --> 05:07.000
So it's, and I think that I think the coolest thing is that combats that phenomenon is this shared language. I think that's when artifice really comes in handy.

05:07.000 --> 05:21.000
Like, it's like, like, you get tools, you get told like, okay, this is the phrase, this is a phrase we use for this thing, so that you both know that phrase so that you're not just on autopilot.

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
So when you start to get into a fight or something, you actually have a thing that you can talk about, say, go like, oh, is this a scenario seven, you know, kind of thing.

05:29.000 --> 05:41.000
And my big thing was that my epiphany has been this thing that the counselor called emotional bids, emotional bids, Jeff. Bids.

05:41.000 --> 05:55.000
So, you know, when there's two people in a conversation, my thing has always been, well, one person's always going to need something and then the other person's always going to be having to give it, which means that one person's getting like robbed.

05:55.000 --> 06:09.000
You know, like, I always feel like everyone's trying to steal my life force away from me and my time, my energy, like, fish hooks are coming at me and they're going to get into me and if I don't fend them off and police my own space,

06:09.000 --> 06:21.000
I'm going to get dragged into someone else's, like, energy and I'm going to get dragged down and I'm going to lose my life for three hours of playing Borderlands 2 or something.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
The counselor said, here's the thing that couples do, they make emotional bids.

06:27.000 --> 06:36.000
So you say, like, for instance, one of my big things that makes me insane is that if I'm driving and Aaron says, look at that, look at that thing over there.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
My immediate emotional reaction is to go, God damn it, I don't want to look at shit.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I always, I hate it.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
That's fair.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
I hate it when people, that's my extreme example of, like, how extreme it is with me.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
Like, I hate fucking, like, I hate when people go, like, look at that, like, I'm thinking, I hate you, don't make me look it.

06:56.000 --> 07:05.000
I have my own head, I can swivel it, I have eyes, if I want to look at something, I'll look at it, like, that's me being crazy.

07:05.000 --> 07:13.000
But that's just an example of, like, somebody saying, look at that, or somebody saying, like, oh, Game of Thrones is on tomorrow.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
Like, anything, any sound you make, anything, it's an emotional bid.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
My new way of seeing it, the counselor said it to me.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Why is it a bid?

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Well, I'm going to.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Don't interrupt me.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Look over here.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
No, look over here.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
You have to think of the relationship as a third thing in the room with you and your lover.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
When a person wants something from you, don't even look at it that way.

07:49.000 --> 07:56.000
You think of it as them putting a little poker chip, a bid, into the relationship bank.

07:56.000 --> 08:07.000
So you don't have to think about it like, I have to give you something or you need something, it's like, it's you putting something in to this third thing.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
And then you can have three responses to that, one of three.

08:11.000 --> 08:21.000
You can do what's called facing forward, which is like acknowledging it, which is a form of putting your own bid in there to match it.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
And both parties are going to draw checks on this bank from time to time.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
You need your relationship to be there when you're feeling bummed out.

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
Sometimes you're sick or you're in bad mood, you feel fat, you want to, you go like, oh, can I fall back on this relationship, you know?

08:37.000 --> 08:47.000
And if it's overdrawn, if there's no trust, if it's like somebody puts a bid in it and then if you go like, for example, by saying like, oh, our favorite show's on tonight.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
If you go, yeah, yeah, that's you taking the bid out, like wiping your ass with it.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
I don't know where the metaphor goes, but you're not matching it.

08:56.000 --> 09:08.000
And then what happens is, and this happens a lot with men and women, is that because men have this thing, they think too logically in their discourse.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
So it's like, look at that thing, isn't that pretty?

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
And then the guy will tend too often to go like, I don't see how that's more pretty than anything else in particular.

09:17.000 --> 09:26.000
Trying to make sure, because I think we're socialized, at least American men are socialized to be more logical, not change our minds and all this stuff.

09:26.000 --> 09:37.000
And then like, so that's like an example of you betray the trust and then the other person will double down on the bid and start putting more shit in there.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
And then they get all messed up and like, they go like, I don't know.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
I do everything and you don't do anything.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
It comes out at random times, like, I could put so much shit into this relationship and all that stuff.

09:51.000 --> 10:05.000
All you got to do is just like retrain your brain, even if it's perfunctural, because they've done these studies where they take like, they finally started taking like couples science into like, like they just study us like animals now.

10:05.000 --> 10:20.000
And they just take like people who are happy as couples and they just study their behavior and they found that if you can make bad couples emulate good couples behavior, bad couples can turn into good couples.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
They get happy.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
So what is the good behavior?

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
The good behavior is just that rhythm of matching emotional bids.

10:26.000 --> 10:35.000
Like someone, if someone petitions the relationship for acknowledgement, then you got to, you got to ring that bell too.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
You just, just once, that's it.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Hey, look at that bridge.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Oh, yeah, that's a great bridge.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Like without being sarcastic, you know, you don't have to agree that it's a great bridge, but you also don't be a shithead.

10:44.000 --> 10:59.000
Like just, just say, yeah, it's a great bridge, like, like, like, like, just, just stop, you know, face forward, like, like literally physically face the person that wants your attention and engage them for just as much time as they said, Game of Thrones is on tomorrow.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah, isn't that show great?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Like just, just fucking match it.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Don't I want to talk about this look over there thing and look at the bridge thing.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Like, is that, is that, are you, are you making that up as an actual thing?

11:08.000 --> 11:16.000
No, like, I, I, hey, look, hey, that restaurant's closed and I got, you know, that's, you might have a bad reaction to her just saying, look at that thing.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Yes, yes.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Really?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Anybody.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I can't handle like, like, I don't multitask.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
So if I, like, you know, no one ever knows when I'm thinking about something that, that, like, I could just be standing or doing nothing.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
And what you don't know is that I'm actually engaged in something mentally.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Right.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
And then somebody goes like, like, you like hot dogs?

11:38.000 --> 11:44.000
Like, like, if, if I was literally not thinking about anything, if I was just going like, I hope someone talks to me and someone goes, you like hot dogs?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
I'll go like, oh, I like all kinds of them.

11:47.000 --> 11:54.000
I like foot logs and I like mustard and, and, and that person's like, God, I'm so glad I came over and talked to Dan Harmon.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
But if I, here I am, I'm not only am I, I'm learning about hot dogs.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I thought I knew about them.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
He knows more.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
And, and, and then we're like, you know, cut to us.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Like just arm and arm.

12:07.000 --> 12:19.000
We got a hot dog store or some kind of, but, but if I'm standing there and I happen to be like running some kind of like program, like I'm going like, I've got just thinking about something.

12:19.000 --> 12:26.000
Like running through a conversation in my head or, you know, creating my next masterpiece, of course.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
You guys didn't laugh hard enough at that.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Now I feel like a shithead.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Didn't sound like a joke.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm like an emotional bid.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And then you're like hot dogs.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I'm like, what?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Yeah.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Yeah.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Like mad, like shaking you off like you're a mosquito.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
What?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
What?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
What are you asking me?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Because I don't even hear it the first time.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
I just hear like noise.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
I'm like, what, what, what, what, what, what do you want?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I'll just ask you if you like hot dogs.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Okay.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Oh yeah.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
I like hot dogs.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Jesus Christ.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
You know, I kind of like.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
Creating a masterpiece of my clientele.

13:12.000 --> 13:27.000
So, so that may or may not ever change about me, but what can change about me is I can go from not valuing the relationship enough to take action to valuing the relationship enough to take action.

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
So, so if it's like, it's not about me, that was my big fear about couples therapy is like, oh, they're going to pop the hood open on me.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
I know it's not her that's going to have to change a bunch of shit for us to be happy.

13:38.000 --> 13:47.000
There's going to be fucking blue wires and red wires going to be cut and one of them is going to blow up and the, but, but it's not that.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
It's not really that case.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
It's like, it's for better or for worse, the kind of like the couples therapy perspective is if you're fucked up, you're fucked up.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
But how do you, how do you make a relationship work with a fucked up person?

13:58.000 --> 14:05.000
The fucked up person like what while you're fucked up, here's some things you can do to make your relationship not fucked up.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
So in that moment now, now that you have that, that, that intellectual knowledge of like the emotional bids thing.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Now when you're in your own, because I'm also the same way.

14:15.000 --> 14:21.000
I think probably most of us are like, I get lost in my own thoughts and when somebody interrupts them, I have no idea what's going on.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Like I'm kind of listening where I'm kind of also caught up in my own shit.

14:25.000 --> 14:32.000
Now if Aaron says look at that bridge or do you like hot dogs, you, you, you still going to probably react in that first moment of.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
No, emotionally, yes.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
Like I won't be able to stop myself from like the counselor says it's like when you hit your knee with a hammer.

14:39.000 --> 14:48.000
It's just a reflex reflexes or reflexes, but you have an internal reflexive reaction, but that can be a dinner bell.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Like that can be like a triangle that rings that you, that is a reminder.

14:52.000 --> 15:03.000
Oh, this is the, that moment where I, I do that thing where I stop, face her and acknowledge what she just said.

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
And then go back to, you know, so it's like, yeah, it's literally just changing your behavior.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
So, so you're, you're lost in thought.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
You're creating a masterpiece.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Someone says, do you like hot dogs?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
You hear, wow, wow, wow, wow.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
So in my head, I go, what the fuck, who, what does he want?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Shut up.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
And then I turn, I started like, like, did you say, do I like hot dogs?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Yes, I did.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah, I do.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Oh, thank you.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
I'm so glad I talked to Dan Harmon.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And you know what, sir?

15:35.000 --> 15:44.000
If I was just thinking about my next masterpiece, so I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm going to go back to that.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
My emotional bid.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Now he can either honor that or not.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
He can, he can be like, fuck off.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Get your head out of your ass.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
You fucking fuck.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Whatever.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
But, but, but yeah, it's like, like that's another form of an emotional biz.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Be honest about whether or not you want to hang out or need space.

16:03.000 --> 16:12.000
How do you know when, I guess the metaphor for the bid thing is that you can, you can keep anti-ing and someone can keep just taking the money off the table and not put anything back in.

16:12.000 --> 16:24.000
That's, that's, that's every guy's first question is what if you keep matching emotional bids and you keep having to look at 20 bridges per second.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
That's my, it was my first question.

16:26.000 --> 16:38.000
And then I went to the Rick and Morty writers room and I was so excited about these tools I had learned and every guy was like, immediately was like, what if, but what if you look at the bridge and then say a nice bridge and then you got to do it again five seconds later.

16:38.000 --> 16:54.000
That, that what if, what if the other person abuses me doing the normal right thing and is called mistrust and, and trust is the foundation of a relationship.

16:54.000 --> 17:02.000
So you can, you can change anything you want about a house, but if you don't have trust in a relationship, it doesn't, it just doesn't matter.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
It's just like a fucked up house.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
So, so, so you just have to fucking jump in like, you just have to do the sides of that.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
You're not going to have to look at 20 bridges. There aren't 20 bridges.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.000
She's like, like, she really, she really just wants, it's like breathing, it's respiration.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Look at the, look at the bridge.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
It's nice. It's just like, am I, am I in a relationship with you?

17:22.000 --> 17:31.000
I'm just a microscopic little penny stock level, like, like just a little micro trade, like that keeps the fucking market going.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Look at that bridge. Yeah.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Okay. I see that bridge.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
I'm in the space with you. I am not, I am not numb.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
I am not like, like astral projecting over Miami right now.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
What is, what does your stance on bridges?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Like, do you, do you like bridges?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I don't ever need to look at them.

17:48.000 --> 17:59.000
I think that people put them there because there was something that needed to be ignored, like a ravine.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
Look at that, people were saying, look at that ravine.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
And they're like, yeah, we got to put a bridge over that thing.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Now, 20 years later, there's a bridge on that.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
It's like, it's like, how, like, I don't have to worry about my, the teeth fillings.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
It fell the teeth.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
I just got to eat the corn.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
So that's, I'm living my life and I want to look at my teeth.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
What about the Brooklyn Bridge or the San Francisco Golden Gate?

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
Just a big dumb thing that, that's just a big dumb thing, Jeff. It's a bridge. Who cares?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Seven people died in the construction of that.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
They should, they, they were probably looking at the fucking bridge too much.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Oh, look at this bridge I'm building.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
No, look at your work.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
They died when there was no bridge. They died when it was still a river.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Well, it's so good. It's good they built the bridge. Thank you for dying.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
I don't want to look at the, I don't want to look at the bridge.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Why not?

18:49.000 --> 18:54.000
Because it's a bridge, and I see it on a postcard. It's everywhere. It doesn't matter. I see it on TV.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Do you like, do you like building or do you like to see a skyscraper?

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
No, I don't like architecture. I think it's all dumb.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
I don't like, I think that's what we're learning right now is that you just,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
like there's certain things that some people find fascinating that you don't disregard.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Yeah.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Do you like nature? Like you say, look at that sunset. Look at that mountain. Look at that.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Barely. Barely. Nature gets this much from me.

19:14.000 --> 19:20.000
I, when we were at, you know, if I, if I'm in a new climate, like when we went to Banff,

19:20.000 --> 19:29.000
the city so nice they removed its vowels. It was like in the middle of a national party.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
So nice they effed it twice.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
The, yes, that's it. Okay.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Thank you.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Yes.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
That did deserve a plus.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
It deserved exactly that much.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
No, it didn't deserve a standing ovation. It deserved a nice polite.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
It was like a parlor trick what you did there. It was like, it's like,

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
like if you'd made a ping pong ball come out of my nose, it would deserve that much a plus.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Yeah. If it's breathtaking, you know, it's like, wow, look at that.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
That looks like the shining. It looks like, it looks like that movie I like.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Right.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
You know, look at all those trees. There's so many trees.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
You never, you never just drive it on the road or just stop and go, oh my God,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
there's fucking beautiful water right now.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
I do that once. I took a road trip by myself.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Were you hurt during the process?

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
I remember like, I'm just going to drive and I'm going to like look at nature.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Was this your vision quest?

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Yeah, my vision quest where I ended up just eating at different sizzlers across the country.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Because I don't know what I'm doing.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
I was like, I'm just going to get out there and throw a blade of grass in the air in whichever way it points.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
I'm going to drive that way and, you know, I'm going to meet Reese Witherspoon

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
and she's going to guide me on a thing or make a mixtape for me

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
and I'm going to get cancer and then recover.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
All the shins are going to be playing and I'm going to be like,

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
like finding shit is going to be me in a silhouetted against the sun

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
on a cliff edge going, ah!

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Just different hotels, people going, do you have a reservation?

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
No. Well, what were you thinking?

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
I'm on a vision quest.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
In Denver?

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
I didn't know I was going to end up here.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
Ooh la la, you're in the asshole suite.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
There's coffee in the morning.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Do you not want us to tell you that?

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
Chief vision quest?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
No, I want to know this coffee.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
I was like, I'm just going to drive, I'm going to take this back road

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
and then the sun was setting over this field and I was like,

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
I bet that's the kind of thing that people call beautiful.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
You mean human beings?

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
I'm going to get out of the car and enjoy it like in a movie

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
and I pulled my car over.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
I was like perfectly quiet and beautiful and I got out of the car

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
and I was just like into a cloud of gnats.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
And I ran five feet down the road.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
Jesus Christ, that cloud and the gnats followed me.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Imagine that cloud of gnats, they're like, do they like heads?

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
I don't understand gnats, are they waiting for a head?

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
And then when one comes to them, they're like, we're stoked.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
I think that you perceive a gnat cloud because your head is in a bunch of gnats.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
There's also gnats over there too.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
No, but they're in clouds gnats.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
There's like a cloud, such a thing as a cloud of gnats.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
It's an isolated localized phenomenon.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
They cluster, they like each other.

22:51.000 --> 22:57.000
I don't know if that's just them reproducing or talking, sharing notes on gnats,

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
and then your head goes in it, but it seems like once your head goes in it,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
they're like, there's a head!

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
And you move your head and they move with you because they're like,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
it's a head, that's our new religion.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
We left this guy's head.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
It start does it here.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Because they left it going in your nose and your ears.

23:16.000 --> 23:23.000
They're little gratos, like gnats are hooking up in your mouth.

23:23.000 --> 23:30.000
Anyways, so I got back in the car and yeah, I never got out of it again.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
And I'm still happy, I'm still creating masterpieces.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
But are you saying that you don't generally or frequently or sometimes once in a while

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
have like look around and go, oh shit, like that's what I want to do?

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
Yeah, no, I like weather, like I go like, oh, it's such a beautiful night,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
like when it's really nice.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Yeah, I like that.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Tactile, like things.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Like, oh, what a nice feeling night.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
Like a little salty blanket around me.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
A salty blanket?

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
Do you want me to give you a salty blanket?

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Is that where you jitter my head or something like that?

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
It's a little, just to call it out like that.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
Oh, and also, hey, listen to this.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Listen to the sound my throat makes when I laugh now.

24:26.000 --> 24:32.000
Wait, you have to listen for the, like.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
To the, for the rheumatism?

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
It sounds like a card and bicycle spokes.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
What on earth?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
That's not good.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
That's what I asked the doctor.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.600
That's not good.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.320
I went to an eyes, nose, and throat guy.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.560
What is that about?

24:52.560 --> 24:53.320
Well, I don't know what.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.280
I want a fucking answer.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.280
I don't want to live in a world where there's no answer for that.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.960
Well, he put a camera.

24:57.960 --> 25:04.840
First, he numbed to my nose by shoving a wad of cotton up my nose.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.720
And then he gave me five minutes.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.200
I'll give you five minutes.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.200
That'll numb your nose.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.040
You'll thank me.

25:10.040 --> 25:13.160
Ha, ha, ha.

25:13.160 --> 25:19.400
And then he came back and, like, like, what do they do when they leave for five minutes?

25:19.400 --> 25:23.520
Is that just that, like, like, doctors fucking suck at the worst.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.040
They're just a chair life.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.640
He's not going to hang out for the five minutes that you're going to get numb.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.320
He's going to go do a thing.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.720
They answer an email.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.680
Put some candy crush.

25:32.680 --> 25:33.800
And he put candy.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.280
I thought he was going to place candy crush.

25:36.280 --> 25:41.880
So he comes back and then he takes this camera, which is like, it's like a spaghetti noodle,

25:41.880 --> 25:44.160
like a black spaghetti noodle.

25:44.160 --> 25:49.000
And he just inserts it into my nasal passage and I can feel it.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.960
He says, this won't hurt, but it will tickle.

25:51.960 --> 25:59.720
He was right, but it will hurt psychologically to know a thing is invading your fucking

25:59.720 --> 26:01.720
passages.

26:01.720 --> 26:06.120
It didn't physically hurt, but it broke my mind.

26:06.120 --> 26:10.040
It made me feel small and like an animal.

26:10.040 --> 26:20.040
It made me feel like a small animal, like a, like a, like an ocelot at a zoo.

26:20.040 --> 26:23.640
And they're, and they're just like, he just like kept feeding it and I can feel it going

26:23.640 --> 26:24.640
down my throat.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.000
Like, it was like, you're totally like, you're awake.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Yeah.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
I'm just hanging out.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.760
I'm sitting in a chair and he gave you like a local anesthetic.

26:30.760 --> 26:31.760
Yeah.

26:31.760 --> 26:32.760
Nose.

26:32.760 --> 26:33.760
Yeah.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.760
Meanwhile, this thing going down your throat.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.760
Yeah.

26:35.760 --> 26:36.760
Yeah.

26:36.760 --> 26:37.760
And he's like, okay.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.360
I don't know if he's just trying to be different.

26:40.360 --> 26:45.520
I'd say it probably opens up your, like, I is up your leverage.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.680
So you're, well, why not?

26:46.680 --> 26:48.280
Ah, is he just trying to be hip?

26:48.280 --> 26:49.280
I don't know.

26:49.280 --> 26:53.760
I think he sounds more, maybe I think he's like, ah, he's like fucking bullshit.

26:53.760 --> 26:54.760
Yeah.

26:54.760 --> 27:03.120
Say, ah, this is silver like, man, say E. It wasn't open your mouth and say, so I said

27:03.120 --> 27:07.600
E. And then every time I said it, like, I could feel it in my fucking like nose membrane

27:07.600 --> 27:08.600
vibrating.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.800
That's why he had you say E because he knew that would fucking happen.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.320
Oh, he's not looking at my nose thing.

27:13.320 --> 27:17.000
That's just where the cables run down my fucking throat.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
But that's symptomatic.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.240
He wants to look at something in my throat.

27:19.240 --> 27:22.640
So he says like, okay, there's no, there's no tumors on your vocal cords.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.200
He just fucking blurted that out.

27:24.200 --> 27:28.760
I'm like, thanks for letting me know that was a possibility.

27:28.760 --> 27:33.160
So when I, when you heard that, you thought, let's look for that tumor.

27:33.160 --> 27:36.800
Let's find out where that tumor is and just kept your fucking cool.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.200
That's what he should have done with that five minutes.

27:39.200 --> 27:43.160
Well my nose, no, I'm just gonna take this five minutes to talk about, talk to you about

27:43.160 --> 27:44.160
fucking cancer.

27:44.160 --> 27:47.280
No, because then you, then your throat would tighten up and the thing wouldn't get in there.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.920
You want to be fucking loose as a goose.

27:48.920 --> 27:52.880
So everything's, everything's built on a lie in these, in these buildings and it's full

27:52.880 --> 27:56.400
of these people in white coats that, that, that they have.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.400
Take it easy, man.

27:57.400 --> 28:04.480
There's no, there's no, I've said, said it before, I'll say it again, a serial killer

28:04.480 --> 28:09.840
is, is just a doctor without a parental support system.

28:09.840 --> 28:14.040
It's just, it's just, it's just a kid who didn't, couldn't afford medical school.

28:14.040 --> 28:17.480
They all start by looking at a cat under the crawl space and gets pulled out.

28:17.480 --> 28:18.480
They all go like, oh, that's neat.

28:18.480 --> 28:21.040
I want to see what's inside there.

28:21.040 --> 28:28.320
And then then some of them end up just stalking the fucking streets of, of, of Buffalo.

28:28.320 --> 28:34.200
And then others end up charging you 60 grand to, to, to hit your knee with a hammer.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.440
You live in a terrifying world.

28:36.440 --> 28:41.440
You just like, like, these people, like, they want to open you up and they, they love it.

28:41.440 --> 28:42.440
They love it.

28:42.440 --> 28:43.440
And everything's a shot with them.

28:43.440 --> 28:48.520
Like, I can't wait to put a needle in you and take out your plasma out of your body,

28:48.520 --> 28:56.400
your vital liquids, you, the seawater simulation that we evolved to carry with us, to keep

28:56.400 --> 28:58.600
us alive.

28:58.600 --> 29:03.680
You know, like when we came out of the ocean, are you having a stroke right now, man?

29:03.680 --> 29:07.000
I, I'm worried about you right now.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.200
Do it, do it, do it again.

29:12.200 --> 29:22.720
Are you, how do we, I'm pretty sure that's a tumor, that's got to be a tumor.

29:22.720 --> 29:23.720
What makes sense?

29:23.720 --> 29:24.720
It's not a tumor.

29:24.720 --> 29:25.720
It's not a tumor.

29:25.720 --> 29:26.720
It's so dumb.

29:26.720 --> 29:27.720
Don't, uh, come on.

29:27.720 --> 29:31.720
No, that, that doesn't, that does deserve applause too.

29:31.720 --> 29:36.720
Not more than the f-dit twice, uh, certainly not, certainly not.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.880
There's, there's, there's different reasons to applaud.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.880
That was some cullier level shit.

29:40.880 --> 29:44.880
He said tumor, I can go, it's novel tumor.

29:44.880 --> 29:50.480
Uh, anyways, not to, not to punish you, to keep your reactions organic, you, you, I'm

29:50.480 --> 29:51.480
not going to punish you.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.480
I'm fucking alarmed at that sound.

29:53.480 --> 30:01.680
There's like a dude in there, there's like an indie film being produced.

30:01.680 --> 30:06.760
And there's like a guy in a larynx who's like, where am I, where's I, I can't imagine

30:06.760 --> 30:08.560
why, but it felt as raising his hand over here.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.560
I, please be a doctor.

30:09.560 --> 30:14.560
Uh, I have tumors on my vocal cords, not a big deal.

30:14.560 --> 30:15.560
Oh.

30:15.560 --> 30:20.360
I, I'm not sure we got that on mic.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.760
He said, oh, I have tumors on my vocal cords.

30:22.760 --> 30:23.760
Not a big deal.

30:23.760 --> 30:24.760
All right.

30:24.760 --> 30:25.760
Cool.

30:25.760 --> 30:26.760
Well, I don't have them.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.840
So I probably have something worse.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.960
Is the tumor in your trachea a big deal?

30:30.960 --> 30:31.960
Yes.

30:31.960 --> 30:32.960
Okay.

30:32.960 --> 30:33.960
Well, now I get to.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.760
Do you, do you make that sound when you do it on an exhale like that?

30:36.760 --> 30:38.760
As far as I know, I don't.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.760
No.

30:39.760 --> 30:40.760
Try it out.

30:40.760 --> 30:46.400
The reason why I found out about it is because of all this podcaster-y, like I've been listening

30:46.400 --> 30:49.760
to myself, you can hear it and like, I, you should Tyler's podcast, like you hear, I,

30:49.760 --> 30:55.760
when I laugh, I go off and go, and then, and then like, like, it sounds like the mic's

30:55.760 --> 30:56.760
broken or something.

30:56.760 --> 30:58.960
Maybe you're just, maybe you're just purring.

30:58.960 --> 31:01.560
Anyways, there's no discomfort or anything.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.560
It's just this sound.

31:02.560 --> 31:03.560
So I,

31:03.560 --> 31:04.560
Another hand is right.

31:04.560 --> 31:05.560
I want this.

31:05.560 --> 31:06.560
Please.

31:06.560 --> 31:07.560
I'll be doctors.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.560
Do you snore too?

31:08.560 --> 31:09.560
I snore and I do.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.360
When I gain a certain amount of weight, I get sleep apnea.

31:12.360 --> 31:16.640
Like I, I'll, I'll wake up like, like freaking out.

31:16.640 --> 31:17.640
Thank you for asking.

31:17.640 --> 31:22.960
Uh, so that's, these are questions the guy asks a doctor.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.560
So he pulls the camera out.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.160
He pulls it out, which was so fucked up.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.160
Like, it was like, it was like, you know,

31:28.160 --> 31:33.260
He's pulling out like, like just like anal beads and just like those, like, like anal

31:33.260 --> 31:34.260
beads.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.260
Yeah.

31:35.260 --> 31:36.260
Like yank.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.760
I'm, I'm assuming nasal beads.

31:38.760 --> 31:39.760
Yeah.

31:39.760 --> 31:40.760
Yeah.

31:40.760 --> 31:45.560
It was kind of like, like, like these people don't care about the, you know, they, they

31:45.560 --> 31:47.560
look at us like, they look at us like, like animals.

31:47.560 --> 31:50.160
I'm assuming they reuse that because it's got to be tech technology.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.160
But they, they, they, they, how do they clean that thing off?

31:52.160 --> 31:53.160
It's been done a million people.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.160
Yeah.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.160
He just put it down and I'll bet you 10 bucks.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.960
The next guy that came in, he's probably, he probably sprays it.

31:57.960 --> 32:01.960
He sprays it with like a, you know, a mist of like avion or something.

32:01.960 --> 32:10.040
He probably like runs it under a UV light or something like that, that, that some pharmaceutical

32:10.040 --> 32:12.960
company gave him for free to push pills.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.760
Here, is that from, from Raziplas.

32:15.760 --> 32:16.960
It's a free gift.

32:16.960 --> 32:23.400
This, this UV light will make all the AIDS go off of your equipment.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.400
Go ahead.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.400
Trust us.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.400
And don't forget Raziplas.

32:26.400 --> 32:32.400
For every $80 Raziplas prescription will give you a golf club.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.400
So he pulls it out.

32:34.400 --> 32:39.400
Do you have anything, did he say, here's why you're, you make that sound all of a sudden?

32:39.400 --> 32:40.400
No.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.400
He said, he said, no tumors on your vocal cords, which I'm now finding out would have been

32:43.400 --> 32:44.400
the fucking jackpot.

32:44.400 --> 32:50.400
No, it just wouldn't have been a big deal, man.

32:50.400 --> 32:55.400
And now, and then he said, okay, so now I'm going to get, here's what I, here's what

32:55.400 --> 32:57.240
we have to eliminate as a possibility.

32:57.240 --> 33:00.400
You have acid reflex.

33:00.400 --> 33:05.400
What sometimes can happen is it'll, during your sleep, some acid will splash into your

33:05.400 --> 33:06.400
trachea.

33:06.400 --> 33:10.000
Trachea will swell up a little bit and that can make that sound.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.400
Like the, like, I don't know.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.400
It's like a flappy.

33:12.400 --> 33:17.680
It looks like your trachea is farting when you're exhaling like, because it's a little

33:17.680 --> 33:19.720
swollen from the acid.

33:19.720 --> 33:23.960
So he gives me like advanced Prilosec, like a kind of like free samples of some kind of

33:23.960 --> 33:24.960
shit.

33:24.960 --> 33:28.560
And then he gave me a shot at cortisone because I honestly think it's just because they like

33:28.560 --> 33:29.560
to hurt people.

33:29.560 --> 33:33.400
I don't, I don't, I don't, the cortisone was supposedly supposed to clear the pathways

33:33.400 --> 33:34.400
or something.

33:34.400 --> 33:37.200
They just, they just don't feel like they've done their job unless they've inflicted some

33:37.200 --> 33:39.200
kind of torture on someone.

33:39.200 --> 33:42.200
They take a nose and that's the first line.

33:42.200 --> 33:46.520
I know, but why do you think that is if you protest too much, you know, like, like, like,

33:46.520 --> 33:51.480
okay, all right, I swear to God, I'm not a serial killer.

33:51.480 --> 33:56.760
If you have to say that before you go to work, like, fucking go to check it out.

33:56.760 --> 34:01.920
You know, I don't know, man, paranoid.

34:01.920 --> 34:07.480
It's called, uh, well, uh, Latrophobia.

34:07.480 --> 34:10.480
Fear of doctors.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.480
Look it up, man.

34:12.480 --> 34:13.480
All right.

34:13.480 --> 34:14.480
So you're good.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.480
You're all right.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.480
No, I'm not good.

34:16.480 --> 34:21.040
I mean, I'm, I mean, I'm Schrodinger's, uh, uh, health.

34:21.040 --> 34:26.040
I know, because it's not, he gave me this stuff and it's not going away.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.040
Jesus.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.920
It's fucking really disturbing.

34:29.920 --> 34:33.040
So I had to schedule an appointment.

34:33.040 --> 34:36.760
If you, it sounds like almost like a read the way read instruments make notes.

34:36.760 --> 34:37.760
Yeah.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.520
If you, if you actually held hard enough, you might make a nice note.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.520
Yeah.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.520
Yeah.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.520
Go really hard.

34:42.520 --> 34:43.520
Try it.

34:43.520 --> 34:56.720
Uh, so anyways, if it doesn't go away, which it clearly isn't, and I go to a follow-up

34:56.720 --> 35:03.400
appointment, then I got to get a CAT scan, which is, as we all know, is the thing you

35:03.400 --> 35:06.640
get before they tell you you're dying.

35:06.640 --> 35:10.760
She, she, I was going to make a bad joke.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.960
I would have gotten no applause.

35:12.960 --> 35:13.960
What if they gave me a cat?

35:13.960 --> 35:16.560
Were you going to say, what if they gave you a CAT scan and there was a cat in you?

35:16.560 --> 35:18.960
I was going to say Schrodinger's CAT scan.

35:18.960 --> 35:19.960
Wow.

35:19.960 --> 35:20.960
Good night, everybody.

35:20.960 --> 35:31.160
I think, I don't know how much of that was like, they're like, let's do a bit by it.

35:31.160 --> 35:35.640
I guarantee the people clapping all thought of that joke too, they're applauding themselves

35:35.640 --> 35:36.640
for that one.

35:36.640 --> 35:37.640
All right.

35:37.640 --> 35:51.680
It's like an HP Lovecraft, like, it's a pineal gland, you can end up sounding like Tom Waits,

35:51.680 --> 35:53.480
like, are you going to get that?

35:53.480 --> 35:54.480
I don't know.

35:54.480 --> 35:55.480
I don't know, man.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.160
Well, no, because it's not on my vocal cords.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.160
It's not.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.160
I may end up.

35:59.160 --> 36:00.160
Wait, so what's it on?

36:00.160 --> 36:01.160
Is it your larynx or what?

36:01.160 --> 36:02.160
He's trachea?

36:02.160 --> 36:03.160
Trachea.

36:03.160 --> 36:18.480
All right, let's bring out a son of a doctor, Kumeil Nagyare.

36:18.480 --> 36:24.720
I am a son of a doctor.

36:24.720 --> 36:31.920
It's very hard to bite my little lip back there while you're going off on half my family's

36:31.920 --> 36:33.400
chosen profession.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.960
But your dad's a shrink, right?

36:35.960 --> 36:41.160
Yeah, they're also psychopaths.

36:41.160 --> 36:46.000
They're like, we don't just play God with the body, we play God with the mind.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.320
Is he a psychiatrist or a psychologist?

36:48.320 --> 36:49.320
Iotrist.

36:49.320 --> 36:50.320
Psychiatrist.

36:50.320 --> 36:54.080
So he can, yeah, he's probably experimenting with all kinds of drugs all the time.

36:54.080 --> 37:00.840
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's like sort of furthering Nazi technology.

37:00.840 --> 37:05.800
He's got like people under there that he's crossbred with monkeys and stuff like that.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.320
He's doing some new shit.

37:07.320 --> 37:08.320
I don't know.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.080
I don't think my dad has an exciting life.

37:10.080 --> 37:17.200
I don't think he's like, first of all, he is, he's a very kind, nice man.

37:17.200 --> 37:24.320
And he, I think, genuinely is affected by people being sick around him, which is not

37:24.320 --> 37:27.520
good because that's not a good doctor.

37:27.520 --> 37:31.680
You don't want a doctor who's crying on the operating table, like, oh, fuck this.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.680
I hope I get this right.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.680
Oh, shit.

37:35.680 --> 37:36.680
Why?

37:36.680 --> 37:39.680
Why did I choose this?

37:39.680 --> 37:41.040
I think it really is like that.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.920
I see him, I see him be affected by that.

37:42.920 --> 37:47.400
But I think he's a psychiatrist and I don't, I don't know if he's like dealing with really

37:47.400 --> 37:49.160
interesting stuff or anything.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.000
Does he have like an office downtown?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
No.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Downtown Pakistan?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Yeah.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Yeah.

37:56.000 --> 38:03.360
Well, Pakistan, as you know, is an eight-block radius, isn't it?

38:03.360 --> 38:07.760
We just got our second ice cream shop.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.640
Very exciting.

38:09.640 --> 38:11.760
We do have seven Starbucks, though.

38:11.760 --> 38:14.200
That's just a Starbucks drug.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.600
Can I ask you guys a question?

38:16.600 --> 38:21.280
What do you guys make of these people in the movies and on the TV shows when they, when

38:21.280 --> 38:25.920
someone asks them to sit and then they go, I'd rather stand?

38:25.920 --> 38:26.920
Who, what is it?

38:26.920 --> 38:28.920
I don't get those people.

38:28.920 --> 38:29.920
Why would you?

38:29.920 --> 38:31.920
That is a very specific beef, my friend.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.440
I was just thinking about that.

38:34.440 --> 38:35.440
You know, like...

38:35.440 --> 38:39.200
I mean, also, I would say who tells, I'd like you to sit down for this.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.200
Yeah.

38:40.200 --> 38:41.200
Who does that, first of all?

38:41.200 --> 38:42.200
Yeah.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.720
If someone said to you, like, look at that bridge, you'd be, fuck you.

38:43.720 --> 38:44.720
Yeah.

38:44.720 --> 38:45.720
And so it goes, sit down.

38:45.720 --> 38:46.720
You go, fuck, now I'm standing.

38:46.720 --> 38:47.720
But I get it.

38:47.720 --> 38:48.720
Okay, yeah.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.040
But it's never like that in the movies.

38:50.040 --> 38:55.640
It's more like, it's more like, like, you're supposed to sit because, you know, they want

38:55.640 --> 38:59.320
to tell you something you don't want to hear and then the person's like, I'll do it, standing.

38:59.320 --> 39:02.320
Like what kind of, what kind of conviction is that?

39:02.320 --> 39:03.320
Just sit.

39:03.320 --> 39:04.320
It's a free seat.

39:04.320 --> 39:07.000
How often do you get to sit in this life?

39:07.000 --> 39:11.080
I mean, how many battles do you get to fight that you're definitely going to win?

39:11.080 --> 39:12.400
Like that's one of them, right?

39:12.400 --> 39:13.400
Oh, okay.

39:13.400 --> 39:14.840
Like, this one I win.

39:14.840 --> 39:15.840
Make me sit.

39:15.840 --> 39:16.840
Yeah.

39:16.840 --> 39:20.160
Next time someone tells me to sit, I'm definitely going, I'd rather stand.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.160
Definitely.

39:21.160 --> 39:26.520
You know what I always wanted to do in my life is when someone says, are we clear?

39:26.520 --> 39:27.680
I want to say crystal.

39:27.680 --> 39:35.560
I want to do that, you know, I also want to say like game, recognize game and like a

39:35.560 --> 39:39.600
ironic game, recognize game, recognize game.

39:39.600 --> 39:40.600
People do that.

39:40.600 --> 39:41.600
No, no, no.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.600
That phrase.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.600
It's badass.

39:43.600 --> 39:44.600
Say it again.

39:44.600 --> 39:45.600
Game, recognize game.

39:45.600 --> 39:49.040
Like, like, oh, you're good, I'm good, and we see each other.

39:49.040 --> 39:50.040
Yeah.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.960
Wait, I don't get it.

39:51.960 --> 39:56.240
Like we're both con artists or not a game.

39:56.240 --> 40:01.520
I mean, game, you two great minds think alike.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.520
Yeah.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.520
Game, recognize game.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.520
That's so dumb.

40:04.520 --> 40:12.840
Wait, wait, wait, am I not being clear that did not set you up for crystal?

40:12.840 --> 40:16.080
Also, he doesn't recognize game, Camille.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.080
No.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.080
I recognize clunky.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.080
Clunky.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.080
Recognize clunky.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.460
That is hard to say.

40:23.460 --> 40:24.960
Game, recognize game.

40:24.960 --> 40:30.960
That's a lot of fucking consonants and you guys have heard that, right?

40:30.960 --> 40:32.600
That's not a smooth thing.

40:32.600 --> 40:33.600
It's still really stupid.

40:33.600 --> 40:34.600
It's really.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.600
Game, recognize game.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.920
Well, you know why you guys don't recognize game.

40:37.920 --> 40:38.920
I recognize game.

40:38.920 --> 40:45.600
I don't think, I don't think liking that thing means you have game.

40:45.600 --> 40:50.080
I think that's, that's, that's an absence of games to say no, like Joshua in war games.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.800
Like, like it makes you sound like a robot.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.800
Game recognize game.

40:53.800 --> 40:54.800
Yeah.

40:54.800 --> 40:58.320
No, it's a conveying an idea with only three words that would take longer than three words

40:58.320 --> 40:59.320
to convey.

40:59.320 --> 41:00.320
It's not even a real sentence.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.320
It's caveman language.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.320
No, but you're conveying.

41:02.320 --> 41:03.320
It doesn't matter if it's a real thing.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.320
What are you conveying?

41:04.320 --> 41:05.320
I still don't even understand it.

41:05.320 --> 41:06.320
Okay.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.320
See?

41:07.320 --> 41:08.320
It's so hard.

41:08.320 --> 41:09.320
You've got no game, man.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.320
Yeah.

41:10.320 --> 41:14.760
If I had to explain it to you, you've got, you've got, you've got game, you've got game.

41:14.760 --> 41:19.640
So if you've got game, and I've got game, game recognize game, also game, game hate

41:19.640 --> 41:20.640
verbs.

41:20.640 --> 41:21.640
Yeah.

41:21.640 --> 41:22.640
Yeah.

41:22.640 --> 41:23.640
Tacho loves recognize.

41:23.640 --> 41:30.120
Recognize is a verb, motherfuckers, but, but it, uh, uh, you have to recognize verbs

41:30.120 --> 41:40.480
game, game hate sweat, prepositional phrase, let him know fire, kill mother.

41:40.480 --> 41:44.440
I mean, like, I like, are we clear at crystal because that sounds filming the wire.

41:44.440 --> 41:45.440
That's good.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.440
Yeah.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.760
Um, let me come up with another three word thing.

41:48.760 --> 41:52.320
Oh, uh, uh, vocal cord tumors.

41:52.320 --> 41:53.320
Okay.

41:53.320 --> 41:54.320
Oh, yeah.

41:54.320 --> 41:55.320
Okay.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.320
Here's one.

41:56.320 --> 42:02.080
And by the way, I think you should go to a different doctor.

42:02.080 --> 42:05.160
I like, yeah, I like how Blassey, that one, I said, I got you got tumors all over your

42:05.160 --> 42:06.160
throat.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.160
It's no big deal, bro.

42:07.160 --> 42:08.160
No big deal.

42:08.160 --> 42:10.160
Hey, I have great news.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.840
You have tumors all up in your throat.

42:12.840 --> 42:17.520
I have to go home.

42:17.520 --> 42:18.960
Game recognized game.

42:18.960 --> 42:22.160
I was, I was at the, I may have said this on the show before, but I don't think so.

42:22.160 --> 42:26.680
I was at the airport at 10am, uh, LAX and one of the shitty terminals cause all LAX

42:26.680 --> 42:28.560
terminals are the worst cause it's not a good airport.

42:28.560 --> 42:29.560
I'm from LA.

42:29.560 --> 42:32.080
I, I'm proud of LA, but our airport is shit.

42:32.080 --> 42:33.080
And I was sitting there.

42:33.080 --> 42:36.320
It was like nine, 10am and the bar is rammed at 10am.

42:36.320 --> 42:41.800
Like somehow it's okay at the airport to get beer with your breakfast at 9am.

42:41.800 --> 42:42.800
There's no rules.

42:42.800 --> 42:43.800
Fuck everything.

42:43.800 --> 42:45.480
Airports, airports are for drinking.

42:45.480 --> 42:46.480
Drink at an airport.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.480
It's fucking great.

42:47.480 --> 42:48.480
Is it?

42:48.480 --> 42:49.480
Yeah.

42:49.480 --> 42:56.080
They have a, they have a, uh, uh, a bar, well, you, in, in, in, in Europe, like, like,

42:56.080 --> 43:00.480
like, like, in Ireland, um, you sound like a child right now.

43:00.480 --> 43:02.480
Cause I'm excited.

43:02.480 --> 43:07.240
There's this bar in Ireland, in Europe, Dan, Dan, should we, should we be sitting down

43:07.240 --> 43:08.240
for the story?

43:08.240 --> 43:13.480
There was a flight out of Dublin, uh, and, and there's a, there's like a fucking, it's

43:13.480 --> 43:18.000
like a pub, like, like, like it was like a cross from the gate.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.560
Like it was like, I sat and I had a pint, like a child trying to, uh, describe Legoland

43:23.560 --> 43:24.560
right now.

43:24.560 --> 43:31.720
There was, there was this bar and, uh, they had pints and they, and they have one in Chicago,

43:31.720 --> 43:37.080
perhaps to Chicago, O'Hare, O'Hare is the worst airport in Ireland.

43:37.080 --> 43:38.920
That's not true.

43:38.920 --> 43:39.920
Not true.

43:39.920 --> 43:44.920
But they have a bar there that while, while, while, over a bar in Chicago now, I've heard

43:44.920 --> 43:45.920
everything.

43:45.920 --> 43:50.120
At the airport, like, like here's the problem with most bars now that's like, like in airports,

43:50.120 --> 43:53.720
like they've all, they've all become like these like fucking Flanagan Johnson's.

43:53.720 --> 43:54.720
They have.

43:54.720 --> 43:55.720
Open at noon.

43:55.720 --> 43:56.720
Yeah.

43:56.720 --> 43:57.720
Um, closes at 3 p.m.

43:57.720 --> 44:02.720
Uh, and then they've got fucking robots on the, on the bottles so that no one can, that

44:02.720 --> 44:03.720
of fury.

44:03.720 --> 44:04.720
Oh, is that right?

44:04.720 --> 44:08.480
They've got an overpour and the bartender's like, if you, if you make fun of it, it's

44:08.480 --> 44:10.960
like, it's like, oh, meet, meet, mop, mop.

44:10.960 --> 44:12.560
Is that a proper shot?

44:12.560 --> 44:13.560
Good job.

44:13.560 --> 44:14.560
Logan's run.

44:14.560 --> 44:18.200
Like, wait, he got upset at that?

44:18.200 --> 44:19.200
The bartender's really quick.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.200
Recognize game.

44:20.200 --> 44:27.080
They, they, I'm fucking hitting three pointers all night tonight, man.

44:27.080 --> 44:29.400
You don't, I fucking can't lose.

44:29.400 --> 44:30.880
Um, all right.

44:30.880 --> 44:37.600
Anyway, whatever, there's a, there's an airport bar in Chicago that's like, like, it's goofy

44:37.600 --> 44:41.800
because it's like kind of like, like, uh, is it the, the all brushed aluminum sports

44:41.800 --> 44:42.800
center kind of?

44:42.800 --> 44:46.320
No, it's like a, it's like a bright white, like it's like, it's like you're in the Billy

44:46.320 --> 44:50.520
Jean video and Michael Jackson has touched all the everything.

44:50.520 --> 44:51.520
Wow.

44:51.520 --> 44:52.520
Okay.

44:52.520 --> 44:53.520
Oh, younger crowd.

44:53.520 --> 44:58.920
Uh, by the way, if you guys don't get it, it is a fucking spot on description.

44:58.920 --> 45:01.280
That was pretty amazing.

45:01.280 --> 45:05.960
Um, but so it's, so in that sense, it's not the place, it's not a place that I would

45:05.960 --> 45:10.360
drink out if it was, it was just in Los Angeles, but, but here's the kick.

45:10.360 --> 45:12.840
Here's the, here's the thing.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.960
No fucking kids because it's like clearly a grown up place.

45:15.960 --> 45:20.080
And so there's not fucking families go like eating their mustard sandwiches with their

45:20.080 --> 45:24.200
fucking strollers going like, I can't wait to get the Disney world.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.520
And it's like, I'm a fucking alcoholic.

45:26.520 --> 45:27.520
Get out of here.

45:27.520 --> 45:28.520
Yeah.

45:28.520 --> 45:29.520
Yeah.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.520
This is my job.

45:30.520 --> 45:33.160
I'm at work right now.

45:33.160 --> 45:36.600
It used to be part of the culture, you know, you go to the airport and it's like, oh, it's

45:36.600 --> 45:37.600
the airport.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.000
There's no law here.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.280
Booze wise.

45:40.280 --> 45:44.240
You can't be judged for drinking at 9am because it might be 3pm to you.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.720
You might be from Melbourne.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.160
That is what it is.

45:47.160 --> 45:48.560
People think they can get away with it.

45:48.560 --> 45:54.360
And also you're in a, like I was just at Chicago O'Hare and where there's like a Mexican,

45:54.360 --> 45:57.360
like there's a big, there's a big food court area and off the side is the Mexican place

45:57.360 --> 45:59.680
of really good guacamole, you know, this place.

45:59.680 --> 46:01.680
And it was really international.

46:01.680 --> 46:06.000
Like everybody was from some, it was like an internationally airport.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.120
Everybody there was from somewhere like, like she was from like part of Mexico.

46:11.120 --> 46:12.120
Someone was from Portugal.

46:12.120 --> 46:13.680
It wasn't all people from Chicago.

46:13.680 --> 46:14.680
No.

46:14.680 --> 46:16.840
I mean, there were people that were connecting through, but everybody was from somewhere

46:16.840 --> 46:19.360
interesting and they were all going to cool places too because it's in there.

46:19.360 --> 46:20.360
How do you know?

46:20.360 --> 46:21.360
Because we all talked.

46:21.360 --> 46:22.360
It was 9am.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.360
He talks to strangers.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.360
He talks to strangers all the time.

46:24.360 --> 46:31.360
Life is like a Stephen King movie without any threat.

46:31.360 --> 46:35.360
I'll go for that.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.360
I'll go for it.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.360
No.

46:37.360 --> 46:38.360
It's just random people connecting.

46:38.360 --> 46:41.960
But there's no boogings outside the fight.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.360
I forget what terminal in Chicago O'Hare.

46:43.360 --> 46:44.360
There's the sporty one.

46:44.360 --> 46:45.360
It's kind of shit.

46:45.360 --> 46:46.360
It's all brushed aluminum.

46:46.360 --> 46:49.440
It is a cranky old fucker that works behind the bar and he's hilarious.

46:49.440 --> 46:53.480
And people that go to the airport a lot go to that bar because he's really funny.

46:53.480 --> 46:54.480
Do you meet a bunch of characters?

46:54.480 --> 46:56.480
It's like a weird cheers kind of situation.

46:56.480 --> 46:59.960
And I actually have met people at that bar in Chicago and gotten their phone numbers

46:59.960 --> 47:04.080
and hung out with them when I came back to town because it's a good place.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.080
This is not good behavior.

47:05.080 --> 47:06.080
You shouldn't be.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.080
It's called having a personality.

47:07.080 --> 47:08.080
This is fucking hanging out with me.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.080
Crazy.

47:09.080 --> 47:10.080
You talk to people.

47:10.080 --> 47:13.880
So anyway, let's get back to my fucking story.

47:13.880 --> 47:21.320
So I met LAX 10am, maybe even 9am and we're at the fucking bar and it's absolutely jammed

47:21.320 --> 47:22.320
with people.

47:22.320 --> 47:24.760
And maybe there was a delay in a flight so it's just completely rammed.

47:24.760 --> 47:26.200
So many interesting people, right?

47:26.200 --> 47:27.200
Yeah.

47:27.200 --> 47:29.040
Well, I get in there and there's nowhere to sit or to stand.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.040
There's no seats at the bar.

47:30.040 --> 47:31.040
There's no table.

47:31.040 --> 47:34.920
So I just walk up and think, I'll have a beer while I'm getting ready to get in the plane.

47:34.920 --> 47:35.920
It's 9am.

47:35.920 --> 47:36.920
I'll have a beer.

47:36.920 --> 47:37.920
We're at the airport.

47:37.920 --> 47:38.920
Yeah.

47:38.920 --> 47:45.920
And I go up there and I wave down the bar to her and he looks at me and he goes, ID!

47:45.920 --> 47:46.920
He just yells ID!

47:46.920 --> 47:47.920
Oh, Jesus Christ.

47:47.920 --> 47:52.200
So I take out my ID and I put it in the bar and then he goes away for a while to make

47:52.200 --> 47:53.200
a drink.

47:53.200 --> 47:54.200
Then he comes back and goes, what do you want?

47:54.200 --> 47:55.200
He didn't look at the ID.

47:55.200 --> 47:56.200
No, no, no.

47:56.200 --> 47:57.200
The ID is on the bar.

47:57.200 --> 47:58.200
Okay.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.200
He's got his hand on it and he's looking at it and he goes, what do you want?

48:00.200 --> 48:02.200
I go, I'd like a Modelo speciale.

48:02.200 --> 48:03.200
He goes, $6!

48:03.200 --> 48:04.200
And so I go, okay.

48:04.200 --> 48:09.640
And he stands there and waits for me to take the money out.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.320
Like he couldn't just go make it.

48:11.320 --> 48:14.360
He's standing there staring at me with his hand on my ID.

48:14.360 --> 48:17.960
And I take the money out and then he takes the money and goes away.

48:17.960 --> 48:18.960
He's all angry.

48:18.960 --> 48:19.960
It's fucking 9am.

48:19.960 --> 48:20.960
It's too busy.

48:20.960 --> 48:22.560
He gives me the beer and there's nowhere to be.

48:22.560 --> 48:26.240
So I just stand behind the people at the bar and I start to drink my beer and he goes,

48:26.240 --> 48:28.520
you can't stand when you're drinking here.

48:28.520 --> 48:32.920
And I turned to them and said, I can stand it if you can.

48:32.920 --> 48:35.760
Which I thought was pretty good for 9am.

48:35.760 --> 48:37.640
No fucking laugh at all.

48:37.640 --> 48:39.760
I can stand it.

48:39.760 --> 48:40.760
Are we clear?

48:40.760 --> 48:41.760
Crystal.

48:41.760 --> 48:42.760
That's fucking better than that.

48:42.760 --> 48:43.760
Because it was on the fucking fly.

48:43.760 --> 48:44.760
Yeah.

48:44.760 --> 48:47.040
You can't stand when you're drinking here.

48:47.040 --> 48:50.920
I can stand it if you can.

48:50.920 --> 48:51.920
No.

48:51.920 --> 48:54.920
Don't give me your fucking bullshit apply.

48:54.920 --> 48:55.920
I thought it was pretty good.

48:55.920 --> 49:00.520
For me, the least believable part of the story is that a beer at the airport costs $6.

49:00.520 --> 49:01.520
It was $8.

49:01.520 --> 49:02.520
Whatever the fuck it was, $8.

49:02.520 --> 49:08.120
So speaking of Chicago, you were in my hometown of Milwaukee.

49:08.120 --> 49:09.120
Yeah.

49:09.120 --> 49:10.120
I'm in Chicago.

49:10.120 --> 49:11.120
I was in Chicago, Minneapolis and Milwaukee.

49:11.120 --> 49:12.120
It was great.

49:12.120 --> 49:13.120
Was it?

49:13.120 --> 49:14.120
Were they a good crowd in Milwaukee?

49:14.120 --> 49:15.120
They were an awesome crowd.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.120
I asked you.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.120
I was like, hey, what's the vibe of the city?

49:17.120 --> 49:20.120
And you said blue collar liberal.

49:20.120 --> 49:21.120
Yeah.

49:21.120 --> 49:22.120
Yeah.

49:22.120 --> 49:23.120
Yeah.

49:23.120 --> 49:24.120
It was awesome.

49:24.120 --> 49:25.120
I had a great time.

49:25.120 --> 49:26.120
I met Frito.

49:26.120 --> 49:27.120
Frito.

49:27.120 --> 49:29.000
He did not introduce himself as that.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
Is it Frito?

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
Frito.

49:31.000 --> 49:38.120
Well, his name is Frito, F-R-I-E-D-E-L, German name, but we always called him Frito, because

49:38.120 --> 49:39.120
it just sounds like Frito.

49:39.120 --> 49:40.120
Frito.

49:40.120 --> 49:41.120
These guys.

49:41.120 --> 49:42.120
No.

49:42.120 --> 49:43.120
Rob Schrab.

49:43.120 --> 49:44.520
It was Schraub yesterday.

49:44.520 --> 49:50.680
He told me the story of how he drove you around while you were losing your virginity in the

49:50.680 --> 49:51.680
backseat.

49:51.680 --> 50:02.960
Well, that actually sounds better than the sad fact is that he would accompany me because

50:02.960 --> 50:10.600
I was afraid to navigate the freeway systems of Milwaukee when I was 16, 17, 16, I was

50:10.600 --> 50:15.160
like, I don't know how to get to this girl's apartment without getting lost.

50:15.160 --> 50:21.040
So he would come with me because he was more grown up than me at our age.

50:21.040 --> 50:27.760
And I rewarded him for his partnership by letting him sit in the girl's living room

50:27.760 --> 50:30.920
and watch TV while I would make out with her in her bedroom.

50:30.920 --> 50:31.920
And then-

50:31.920 --> 50:32.920
What about the family?

50:32.920 --> 50:38.320
Well, do you mean the kid, her kid that was in a crib next to the bed where we were making

50:38.320 --> 50:41.840
out?

50:41.840 --> 50:47.600
You know, sometimes just like a little physical detail in a story opens up the whole afternoon.

50:47.600 --> 50:48.600
Yeah.

50:48.600 --> 50:49.600
Yeah.

50:49.600 --> 50:54.320
Picture a crib with a baby in it and then me making out with the mother of the child

50:54.320 --> 51:01.040
and then above, on the wall above us is a dot matrix printed banner for new kids on

51:01.040 --> 51:02.040
the block.

51:02.040 --> 51:03.040
Wow.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.400
That just said new kids on the block.

51:05.400 --> 51:08.480
And actually said, I heart Jordan Knight.

51:08.480 --> 51:12.760
Every detail of this story made me sadder.

51:12.760 --> 51:18.200
She printed that out for herself and that's in the nursery that she loves Jordan Knight.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.200
Hold.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.800
She was like 20, I think.

51:20.800 --> 51:21.800
Oh, okay.

51:21.800 --> 51:22.800
Yeah.

51:22.800 --> 51:23.800
Old enough to know better.

51:23.800 --> 51:24.800
That's how I wrote.

51:24.800 --> 51:29.120
I didn't know if I wanted a woman old enough that Howard having a baby wasn't like kind

51:29.120 --> 51:30.520
of a bummer.

51:30.520 --> 51:34.600
But then the NKOTB thing, that's what I'm calling it.

51:34.600 --> 51:36.120
That would have been a bummer.

51:36.120 --> 51:38.200
So there's no good age for that.

51:38.200 --> 51:39.200
No.

51:39.200 --> 51:42.560
Unless she was like, it was like, you know, Susan Sarandon and I was like, you know, coming

51:42.560 --> 51:43.560
up.

51:43.560 --> 51:45.280
But then why does she like, why does she like new kids on the block?

51:45.280 --> 51:46.280
Then that's.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.280
Oh, that'd be weird.

51:47.280 --> 51:48.280
Well, maybe.

51:48.280 --> 51:49.280
Maybe she thought our baby would like it.

51:49.280 --> 51:50.280
Yeah.

51:50.280 --> 51:51.280
That is the banner.

51:51.280 --> 51:56.440
So for poor Frito, not only would he like wingman me or whatever you call that, like

51:56.440 --> 52:01.080
sat in the living room and like, well, we would make out chauffeur when it when it finally

52:01.080 --> 52:06.240
came time for me to, uh, discard my maidenhood.

52:06.240 --> 52:15.600
Hey, you're not being very crystal, right?

52:15.600 --> 52:17.280
What do you mean discard your maidenhood?

52:17.280 --> 52:19.280
Losers virginity.

52:19.280 --> 52:24.680
Uh, wait, I was trying to come up with Frazier talk for lose my virginity.

52:24.680 --> 52:25.680
Yeah.

52:25.680 --> 52:26.680
Well, whatever.

52:26.680 --> 52:27.680
Okay.

52:27.680 --> 52:28.680
All right.

52:28.680 --> 52:30.080
I was, it was, it was a bit.

52:30.080 --> 52:31.080
The assholes.

52:31.080 --> 52:33.600
So it was with the same thing.

52:33.600 --> 52:34.600
This isn't Donahue.

52:34.600 --> 52:35.600
All right.

52:35.600 --> 52:36.600
Sorry.

52:36.600 --> 52:37.600
Donahue.

52:37.600 --> 52:41.840
Donahue was a show in the, there was a, there was a guy around the time that the Billie

52:41.840 --> 52:43.800
Jean video was playing.

52:43.800 --> 52:44.800
Yeah.

52:44.800 --> 52:47.400
Right after he was our Ricky Lake.

52:47.400 --> 52:48.400
Okay.

52:48.400 --> 52:50.400
There was this girl, Ricky Lake.

52:50.400 --> 52:53.720
Was it the same lady?

52:53.720 --> 52:55.440
You were like dating a lady.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.960
The, uh, who Ricky Lake?

52:57.960 --> 52:58.960
No.

52:58.960 --> 52:59.960
No.

52:59.960 --> 53:01.640
You were dating this 20 year old lady.

53:01.640 --> 53:02.640
Dating.

53:02.640 --> 53:03.640
Yeah.

53:03.640 --> 53:04.640
Hook it up.

53:04.640 --> 53:05.640
And you were how old?

53:05.640 --> 53:06.640
You were younger than her?

53:06.640 --> 53:07.640
16, 16.

53:07.640 --> 53:08.640
How did you meet her?

53:08.640 --> 53:10.640
Online, but it wasn't really, yeah, it wasn't really called online yet.

53:10.640 --> 53:16.160
It was like a modem chat, a chat room.

53:16.160 --> 53:17.160
Yeah.

53:17.160 --> 53:18.160
Was she a babe?

53:18.160 --> 53:23.480
She was, I met a lot of good looking, uh, uh, young ladies, uh, but, but like, like,

53:23.480 --> 53:30.520
yeah, I never, like considering the possibilities, you know, it could have easily, you know,

53:30.520 --> 53:34.640
you're chatting with someone that's saying, I'm, I'm an 18 year old, let's meet up in

53:34.640 --> 53:35.640
real life.

53:35.640 --> 53:38.560
Like considering how the many ways that could have gone, I was very lucky.

53:38.560 --> 53:40.120
So, so she lived in Milwaukee.

53:40.120 --> 53:41.120
You lived in Milwaukee.

53:41.120 --> 53:42.120
Um, yeah.

53:42.120 --> 53:45.640
And so Frito, you would have a friend of yours drive you because you didn't like navigating

53:45.640 --> 53:46.640
the mean streets of Milwaukee.

53:46.640 --> 53:49.880
I just didn't even know how I was just like, I would, and I, and I, and I, and it's barely

53:49.880 --> 53:50.880
different now.

53:50.880 --> 53:56.880
You're navigating the, the highways, Milwaukee, your own manhood, so much going on, right?

53:56.880 --> 53:57.880
Yeah.

53:57.880 --> 54:01.880
So I, when I came to, I made a virginity, this is just to say how cool Frito is.

54:01.880 --> 54:05.800
Frito didn't drive me around while I did it in the backseat.

54:05.800 --> 54:09.480
We drove to under the home bridge in Milwaukee.

54:09.480 --> 54:10.800
It was the dead of winter.

54:10.800 --> 54:14.360
She didn't want to fuck by the baby.

54:14.360 --> 54:15.360
Is that what it was?

54:15.360 --> 54:16.840
Well, her mom had come home.

54:16.840 --> 54:21.680
It's the night that we did it, her mom came home and was angry because she had found out

54:21.680 --> 54:30.080
that the girl had taped back together a check for the new kids on the block fan club that,

54:30.080 --> 54:35.160
that the mother had ripped up because she hadn't done some chore or something.

54:35.160 --> 54:39.560
So the daughter had, the daughter had taped it back together, sent it to the new kids

54:39.560 --> 54:45.840
on the block and they cashed it because they saw the writing on the wall.

54:45.840 --> 54:46.840
What was it?

54:46.840 --> 54:47.840
Do you realize?

54:47.840 --> 54:48.840
What was the amount?

54:48.840 --> 54:49.840
In sync is coming.

54:49.840 --> 54:51.560
What was the amount on that check?

54:51.560 --> 54:54.600
It was like a fucking dollar, I think it was literally a dollar.

54:54.600 --> 54:56.000
What is that dollar by you?

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
I don't know.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
A more printer ink?

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
I don't know.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
I really don't know.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
That is, God, the story.

55:01.000 --> 55:05.840
But so they got this big, big drunken fight and the mom like pulled out a steak knife

55:05.840 --> 55:11.920
and was like, and I was like in my acrylic sweater with my rat tail and my, my earring

55:11.920 --> 55:17.680
and my pimples going like, hey, cool down, man.

55:17.680 --> 55:19.680
You guys are mother and daughter.

55:19.680 --> 55:20.680
Is there a baby?

55:20.680 --> 55:23.680
You love each other, man.

55:23.680 --> 55:24.680
And it was so romantic.

55:24.680 --> 55:28.480
The kid is not my son.

55:28.480 --> 55:35.000
And so for it to reward me for my valor, we went under the home bridge and you knew it

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
was for this.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.800
She was like, listen, you stood up for me against my mom.

55:38.800 --> 55:42.760
I'm going to take your maiden heart, but she faced it.

55:42.760 --> 55:43.760
That was the deal.

55:43.760 --> 55:44.760
Like seriously.

55:44.760 --> 55:46.760
She was like, let's go get this guy.

55:46.760 --> 55:50.360
I think it was where like kind of like, this is you losing your virginity, the story.

55:50.360 --> 55:51.360
Yeah.

55:51.360 --> 55:55.400
So you'd been working out, you'd been making out with her and you guys hadn't had sex yet.

55:55.400 --> 55:56.400
Right.

55:56.400 --> 55:59.080
And then it was like, this is, I mean, I think it was just a culmination of emotional.

55:59.080 --> 56:01.920
Now there was an emotional crisis and yeah, it was like, let's go.

56:01.920 --> 56:02.920
Let's go somewhere.

56:02.920 --> 56:03.920
It's the fucking anger.

56:03.920 --> 56:11.040
I'm a part of the fucking diamond right now, so, so Frito, this is all just the story that

56:11.040 --> 56:14.080
I'm just telling you how cool Frito is who you bet.

56:14.080 --> 56:25.080
So for fucking Frito hung out in the fucking snow and ice in Milwaukee while I, in my fire,

56:25.080 --> 56:31.720
my mom's firebird, you know, I like that the firebird is the most shocking detail.

56:31.720 --> 56:37.000
Everything is, any, any specific detail from now on is going to make it only worse.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.600
I mean, I told this story a lot before because it's, it's, it's the ending is even more amazing

56:41.600 --> 56:46.680
because all I remember is the day, I know, but yeah, yeah, they had sex with their used

56:46.680 --> 56:53.640
to condom because I'm, I'm a classy, responsible gentleman and it finished and I had the condom

56:53.640 --> 56:55.760
and I like, I didn't know what to do with it.

56:55.760 --> 56:58.680
First condom, first used condom, I didn't have a little bag.

56:58.680 --> 57:06.000
You never masturbated into a condom before you, let's get back to that one, Camille.

57:06.000 --> 57:10.440
We're going to table that one until after dance, sir.

57:10.440 --> 57:16.280
That reminded me of that, that, that toys movie with Robin Williams with someone goes

57:16.280 --> 57:21.480
like, it's floating fake poop, you know, for the bathtub and then a guy goes, come on,

57:21.480 --> 57:28.200
we've all done it and everyone looks at them and says, this is a scene, this is, we all

57:28.200 --> 57:35.200
shit in the tub sometimes.

57:35.200 --> 57:42.240
Camille's blushing right now.

57:42.240 --> 57:43.240
So anyways, I took the condom.

57:43.240 --> 57:44.240
Which takes a lot.

57:44.240 --> 57:45.240
I know.

57:45.240 --> 57:49.960
There was a, I believe it was called a moon roof on the car, it was a sunroof that doesn't

57:49.960 --> 57:56.840
really open all the way, it just kind of props open about 20 degrees and, and so I, I very

57:56.840 --> 58:04.320
gracefully like, went, you took the condom and like, I had to chuck it backwards, like

58:04.320 --> 58:07.360
out the, out the opening of the moonroof.

58:07.360 --> 58:08.360
Ditto winter.

58:08.360 --> 58:12.760
So freedom, freedom, freedom, come back in from the snow, fucking friends forever.

58:12.760 --> 58:13.760
Where is it?

58:13.760 --> 58:14.760
Where is he huddled in a ditch?

58:14.760 --> 58:19.520
Like, he was actually like, we, he was with a friend of the girls, like we, we, we, we,

58:19.520 --> 58:25.200
the girl, my girl, got him a girl, like, like her friend from work.

58:25.200 --> 58:26.680
Was he making out with this other girl?

58:26.680 --> 58:29.320
I don't know if they were making out, maybe they're just chatting and smoking.

58:29.320 --> 58:30.960
I don't know if he got anywhere with her or not.

58:30.960 --> 58:31.960
I can't remember.

58:31.960 --> 58:32.960
It's snowing out, right?

58:32.960 --> 58:33.960
Like it's cold.

58:33.960 --> 58:34.960
Yeah.

58:34.960 --> 58:38.280
And so, Fredo, get back in and we take everybody home and thank you very much.

58:38.280 --> 58:39.280
I got school tomorrow.

58:39.280 --> 58:47.680
I, I, I drive the firebird into the garage, I get out, I go, I stay tiptoe inside, I go

58:47.680 --> 58:53.400
to sleep, I get, I get up in the morning, go out to the cold garage, just the sub zero

58:53.400 --> 59:00.720
garage and, and they're frozen to the roof, but also like, like fucking like amazingly

59:00.720 --> 59:07.080
like a, like frozen in a wind sock kind of like, like it wasn't like a crumpled up thing.

59:07.080 --> 59:13.400
It was like, it had, it had somehow like the wind had like stretched it and like, like,

59:13.400 --> 59:17.880
like, like, like a temple tale, you know, it'd been whipping in the wind probably and

59:17.880 --> 59:26.680
then slowly like, yeah, just like this, this, this, this, this, you know, this like green

59:26.680 --> 59:27.680
antenna.

59:27.680 --> 59:28.680
Yeah.

59:28.680 --> 59:34.280
It's a flag memorializing your spent Maiden hood.

59:34.280 --> 59:41.640
And I just looked at the camera and said, it's a living, I risked out so lucky nobody

59:41.640 --> 59:44.040
else saw that first, your mom didn't come down.

59:44.040 --> 59:45.040
Yeah.

59:45.040 --> 59:46.040
Oh man.

59:46.040 --> 59:47.040
But what would she do?

59:47.040 --> 59:49.400
What would she, she wouldn't touch it.

59:49.400 --> 59:50.400
She'd be like, what's this?

59:50.400 --> 59:56.400
And I would go, mom, that's it.

59:56.400 --> 59:57.400
What do you think?

59:57.400 --> 59:58.400
Gun to your head, mom.

59:58.400 --> 59:59.400
What do you think?

59:59.400 --> 01:00:08.080
That's like when my mom found weed in my clothes pocket, I was home from, I came home

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:13.560
to do my laundry, like a good 20 year old, 20, 20, early 20s guy and my mom was like

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:19.440
going through my laundry, like I found and pulled out this baggie from one of my pockets.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440
What's this?

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:31.200
And I said, that's what you get for going through laundry.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.960
Now you know, I'll explain the condom thing.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:35.960
Okay.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:47.680
I mean, if your whole life, the only way you've come is with feeling your own hand every

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.560
now and then you want to feel something else.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.600
So I would sometimes wear a condom because it would, it feels different because it was

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.600
lubricated.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.600
Yeah.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.600
Lubricated.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.800
I'm not a monster.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.600
I'm sure, I'm sure I've tried it.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.200
I don't recall, but I guarantee you.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.000
I did a pretty high concept shit in my time.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Wait.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.800
I do think I remember like, I remember putting one on because I was like, holy shit, condom.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.800
I'd never put one on.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.800
It feels great.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:20.400
I remember putting a condom on and being like, this feels as good as sex feels, I bet.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.640
I was wrong.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.920
There was way more.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.520
He had a really good condom.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.520
Yeah.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.520
It was too tight.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:32.680
What do you want me to say?

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:39.680
Let's bring out condom expert Spencer Crittenden.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:46.920
Hey guys, what's up?

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920
Hey Spencer.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.240
That's a snazzy podium.

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.240
Man.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.240
It's a Dharma.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.680
It's a lost podium.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.000
I'm into it.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
It's from Dharma.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.880
It's, there's a bunch of props from the Lost TV show at Meltdown.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:04.240
And this is obviously one of them from the Lost TV show.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240
Yeah.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.600
The, the desk in there, if that's the same one is a from the set and it has Dharma logo

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.600
all over it.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.800
Oh, and this is also a Dharma thing.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.080
This is also like a Dharma logo has a guy in the center of it has Mickey Mouse ears

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.080
on.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.080
Yeah.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.480
It's surrounded by like the E Ching shit.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.480
Hmm.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.320
Do you, you don't know lost, I guess.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.320
I know.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.400
I know what you're talking about with Dharma, but those, the symbol with those sticks being

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:33.000
radiated like in an eight, like an octagram that's a, that's like also an E Ching sort

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
of thing.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Hmm.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
The book of changes.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Book of changes.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
No, no big deal.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.400
It's like a vocal tumor.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:46.800
So you know, you guys, this is my hundredth episode on this podcast.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:52.760
Oh, syndication, baby.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.000
I don't want to be shitty, but it's not really the hundredth episode because you have missed

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
some of the middle.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Uh, yeah.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:07.120
So, you know, my hundredth episode being on the podcast, I think very intense days.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.680
You were on the fifth one.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.680
Huh?

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.680
Yeah.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.680
Yeah.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.680
The podcast.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:13.680
How many episodes did we do before we started our recording?

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.680
Is there any idea?

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.680
No, not me.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:19.200
Well, there's actually, we're, we're finding that out right now, digging through the old

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:25.000
we, we recorded them, but never intended to podcast them for a couple of episodes that

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.680
we're digging up now and we're editing them to a little bit for, um, for a kind of box

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.560
set that we're going to offer people.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.560
Yeah.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.560
Yeah.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.560
Yeah.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.560
Yeah.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.560
Yeah.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.560
Yeah.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.560
Yeah.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:43.000
I can't do your throat thing one more time.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Wait.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:52.200
It sounds, it sounds like your stomach is growling out of your throat.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.280
Are you concerned about this, Dan?

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.280
Is this a cause for alarm?

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.800
Well, he went to the doctor.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.800
Yeah.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.800
Was the doctor concerned?

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.200
Well, doctors are not concerned about people.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.520
They've seen the most horrible shit that day.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.200
They've seen someone with a cancer that's going to kill them that day.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.600
I actually had an appointment, I, I, I'm 40 now.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.000
I had an appointment to go to a doctor and get my actual 40 physical and maybe get the

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.960
old, uh, uh, up the, uh, like, like, you know, up the hee-haw.

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.960
Yeah.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.960
Up the hee-haw.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.640
Uh, but then I had, I then I had to go out of town so I missed it, but have you done

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.640
that?

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640
Wait, what is that?

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.400
Yeah, when they, when they put the finger up for the prostate cancer.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.400
Oh yeah.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.400
Well, a guy did that.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.400
You know what you should do?

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.200
When he puts the finger up and gets to the prostate, look at him like guys and go, game

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.200
recognize game.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:40.200
I want to say I can stand it if you can.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.200
Crystal.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.200
Hey, hey.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.200
Can you feel my finger up your ass?

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.200
Crystal.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.200
Crystal.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.880
I went, I went to a guy.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:52.880
Yeah.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:58.080
For my heartburn that my doctor sent me, gave me a referral to a specialist for heartburn.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:05.520
I went in, the guy told me to take off my pants and, and lay down sideways on the table

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:10.280
and he put on a glove and he said, he said some blue comment like, uh, like, this is

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:14.600
going to, uh, uh, uh, this is going to fuck a little bit like, like, like, like I, like

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:19.840
I tell, he had some line he had written like, like I tell everyone, uh, just relax, although

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.840
I'd be surprised if you could, uh, something like that.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.320
And I'm like, I get, so this, and he put his finger up my ass and he's feeling around

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.520
and he goes like, well, no, no internal hemorrhoids.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.760
Uh, everything's fine.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:31.760
Everything's great in here.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:37.480
And I'm thinking, first of all, wrong, uh, you, you don't even know everything about

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.480
my ass.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.960
I have, I have a fucking hemorrhoids.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.560
I like to beat the band.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:46.640
Um, second of all, what part of heartburn don't you understand?

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.640
What's going on?

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.040
Why is there a finger in my ass?

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:55.440
My chest hurts.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:58.440
The way to a man's heart.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:02.440
God, I fucking can't lose tonight.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:06.320
This is really my night.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.120
And then he gave me a prescription of something that I never actually went and got.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.440
I hear, no, he gave me, he gave me another referral to a different guy.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.920
I was like, I'm not doing this anymore.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.920
It's like fire in the sky.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.920
I want you to go see my friend Tony.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.920
He lives in West Hall.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.920
Give him this note.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.920
Don't open it.

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920
Yeah.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920
Yeah.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.920
I go to Tony and Tony's like reading it.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.920
Come downstairs.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.920
Yeah.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.920
Lay down sideways.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920
Yeah.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.920
Yeah.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.920
It's a side.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.920
It's a side.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920
He's called me doctor.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.920
Wow.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:43.720
What could possibly, what could you possibly find a value in there about my heartburn?

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.720
It's all part of the same gastrointestinal.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.720
It's all, we're all the same thing.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.720
Your mouth is a direct line to your butt.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.720
Yeah.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.720
I know that.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.720
But, but it's, my mouth's closer to where it hurts.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.720
Like, and the butt is where the poop comes out.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.720
Yeah.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:03.720
But maybe something's getting happening in there and it's like moving shit back up.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.720
Like I put up, like I put bad food up my butt.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.720
Like, no, like bad food got maybe stuck close to your butt.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720
And we'll be right back.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.720
The beginnings.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.720
This is the beginnings of medicine, by the way.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:20.720
Like maybe some bad food got stuck up your butt, on the way out your butt.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.720
And it's causing, it's sending a signal to you or where your heartburn is happening.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.720
We gotta, we gotta have Schrab here.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.720
Sorry.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.720
Another hand comes up and I'm very fascinated about this.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.720
This is probably called, called loss of opportunity.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.720
Loss of opportunity?

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:34.720
Yeah.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.720
It's something legal.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:43.720
You know, if you've got prostate cancer and the guy doesn't examine a year or two from now,

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.720
he's hooked up.

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:50.720
Oh, so you were saying that maybe heartburn and one of the symptoms of prostate cancer

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.720
is heartburn, so he had to.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.720
No.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.720
That's not what you're saying.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.720
Come up here and get a mic if you're going to talk for a bit.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:07:59.720
I'm curious about this.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.720
You're saying it's a legal thing.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.720
Like, oh, I went to a guy for heartburn two years ago and now I got prostate cancer

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.720
and he should have put a finger at my butt.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:07.720
Yeah.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.720
There's a microphone.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.720
You see.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.720
Yeah.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:18.720
Total pro, great move.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.720
All right.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:26.720
Now wisdom.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:33.720
Okay, so if you get prostate cancer and two years from now, you're really fucked up.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:41.720
And no doctor has seen it and they check your records and they see that you went to a doctor

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:47.720
two years ago and that he could have examined you and he didn't.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.720
Is this specifically about prostate cancer or like any sort of?

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.720
Or is this like a prostate cancer plot?

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.720
If you go into a doctor, you have a chip tooth or a sore throat and they don't put a finger

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.720
at your butt.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.720
They could be sued for malpractice or malfeasance or something.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.720
Yeah, just kind of fucked up because, you know, American medicine and stuff like that.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.720
I have two questions.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.720
What's your name, sir?

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.720
Helder.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.720
Helder.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.720
What do you do?

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.720
I study medicine.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.720
You study medicine?

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.720
Yeah.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.720
Oh, good.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:17.720
So you're going to be a doctor?

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.720
So, yeah.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:19.720
Oh, all right.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:24.720
So, and it all started with you being fascinated by like dead animals and stuff, right?

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.720
And your dad was like, don't be a serial killer.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.720
Go to medical school.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.720
No, no.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:36.720
I'm not from here, you know, I'm from Brazil and there, you know, oh, starting.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.720
All doctors are assholes, major assholes.

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.720
So, let me get this out of the way.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.720
What sort of medicine do you want to practice?

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.720
I really don't know.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.720
Maybe radiology.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.720
But radiology is the cushy one.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:50.720
That's why there's no emergencies.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.720
My cousin radiologist, you make a lot of money.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.720
There's no emergencies.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.720
The hours are easy.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:00.720
You just sort of look in at x-rays and like text, like lab stuff.

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.720
Yeah, kind of.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.720
And you're constantly exposed to radiation.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:04.720
Listen.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.720
Which can't hurt.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:10.720
I mean, as the old saying goes, radiation can't hurt.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:16.720
So, are you saying, Helder, just to be clear, this loss of opportunity concept, it's not

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.720
even like Jeff said, if I went in with a broken pinky, is that so?

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.720
Or is it because it had to do with my internal medicine?

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.720
It didn't have to do with your heartburn, you know.

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:30.720
So, I just got a spine check.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.720
Well, I've been to a doctor and that hasn't happened.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.720
So, why doesn't that happen every time you go to a doctor?

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.720
You're saying doctors live in fear of not diagnosing prostate cancer.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.720
Yeah, it's kind of weird, you know.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.720
But I really don't know exactly why.

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.720
That's one thing that could happen.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.720
I guess you're just playing the odds.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.720
By the way, you already sound like a doctor.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.720
I don't know exactly.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:54.720
I mean, that could happen.

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.720
Just give me a number, doc.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.720
Tell me how long have I got.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.720
That's why I didn't say anything when you were complaining about your...

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.720
What do you think it is?

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.720
I have no fucking idea.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.720
How long have you studied medicine, Helder?

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.720
Six years.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.720
Six years? What school did you go to?

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.720
Or did you go to?

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.720
In Brazil, I studied at a federal university.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.720
Do you live in L.A. now, or are you just visiting?

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.720
No, no, just visiting.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.720
Really? You left Brazil during the World Cup?

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.720
Yeah.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:25.720
It's probably a good time to go, right?

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.720
Sure. Yeah.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.720
You're just visiting Los Angeles.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:30.720
Is that what you said?

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.720
Yeah.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.720
Oh, okay.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:35.720
So you thought it's a good time to get out of here with all the tourists are here and stuff?

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.720
Yeah.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.720
What town are you from?

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.720
Rio.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.720
Yeah, so that's probably a good time to be not at home right now.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.720
Yeah, Rio is complete chaos.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:44.720
How do you feel about it?

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.720
Because all the civil unrest and stuff like that,

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.720
because there was riots leading up to the World Cup.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.720
Oh, he's pro.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:53.720
I think like historically, lots of cities,

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.720
like the local population loses a lot.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.720
Like the working class loses a lot.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.720
It's a bunch of graphs from the top and corporations and contractors get bids and stuff like that.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.720
Does the average person in Rio hate the World Cup?

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.720
Are they happy that it's there?

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:08.720
Yeah.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:15.720
Well, now that it is happening, people are kind of okay with it because Brazil's playing and crazy.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.720
I have a World Cup question.

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.720
I also have one.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.720
Are you a fan of football?

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.720
No.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.720
Okay.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:25.720
He's here.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.720
Why is the logo two hands?

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.720
Hands are like the worst thing in soccer.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.720
Yeah.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720
Soccer.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.720
They hate hands.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.720
That would be like if the hockey logo was like roller skates.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.720
The story of it.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.720
Or if a football logo was a chess board.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.720
Well, that trophy now, there's a good documentary about it.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.720
The trophy now is the world, which is the soccer ball, which is the hands-all holding onto it.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:53.720
That's not the original one.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.720
The original one was like stolen and Hitler wanted it and Mussolini stole it for a while.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:03.720
There was an amazing story about the original trophy, which is this beautiful piece of like art deco,

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:06.720
art gold, and it was really wonderful.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.720
And it was probably the most coveted trophy that will ever be because it was first of all beautiful.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.720
And second of all, it's the World Cup, which is the most important thing for most athletes.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.720
And we don't know where it is, but for a while Mussolini had it,

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.720
and Hitler tried to steal it and shit like that.

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:22.720
It's really good.

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.720
Hitler loved art.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.720
I saw that movie.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:31.720
He was going to build a big Hitler museum with all the art and all the world in it.

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.720
Is this the John Cusack one?

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.720
Monuments, man.

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:36.720
Is John Cusack in that?

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.720
I can't even remember.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:38.720
Everyone was in it.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:39.720
No, George Clooney.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.720
What's the one with young Hitler?

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.720
Oh, that's called Max.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:44.720
Wait, what is it called?

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:45.720
Max?

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.720
Yeah.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:47.720
I told you this podcast.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:52.720
I recommend viewing that because it's like very dramatic.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.720
I don't know.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.720
I don't think it's trying to...

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:59.720
I don't think you can make a movie about Hitler and not have a big dramatic.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:04.720
But it's like, I mean, if you want to see John Cusack pointing at a guy poking him in the chest

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:06.720
and saying, from your heart, Hitler!

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:10.720
I want to see it on the canvas, Hitler!

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.720
It's just funny.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.720
It's like, the world will be my canvas.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.720
I have a football question.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720
What?

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.720
Do you guys not know what he did?

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.720
Too soon, man.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.720
The story ends badly.

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:29.720
The other question, Spencer and I were talking about this on Twitter.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.720
Okay, the hardest thing about watching football is soccer.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.720
You don't know how...

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.720
At 90 minutes, the game is not over.

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.720
At 90 minutes, they're like, now we're going to play for a random amount of time.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.720
As long as I feel.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:45.720
Why do you even have a clock?

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:46.720
It's not random.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.720
I know it's injury time.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.720
It's kind of random.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.720
I know it's not.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.720
Why don't they just pause the clock so that it's always 90?

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.720
That's what all the other sports are doing.

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.720
Why is the time going when they're fucking around?

01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.720
When they're pretending to be hit.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.720
They don't want to stop the clock because they don't want to...

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.720
If you stop the clock like today, they stop you.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.720
You've got to use your hands.

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.720
No!

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.720
No!

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.720
That's what I'm saying.

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.720
That's why they can't stop the clock.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:09.720
Oh, oh, oh.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.720
They hate hands.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.720
Each time there's an injury, there's a guy trying to kick a clock.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.720
And it won't work.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.720
You've got to make a foot clock.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.720
The hardest to work a stopwatch with your feet.

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.720
Yeah.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:24.720
That's the best explanation I've heard.

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.720
But why don't they just pause the fucking clock?

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:31.720
Today, during Mexico Netherlands, they stopped the clock for a water break because it was

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.720
like 97 degrees or whatever and they stopped it for the second time.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:35.720
But they can't do it.

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.720
They know how to.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.720
The second time in World Cup history, they stopped it for a water break, for a refreshment

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.720
break and they went to commercial and it was really a bummer.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:46.720
The one thing that you can dig about soccer or international football is that you don't

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:48.720
see a bunch of fucking commercials.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:51.720
They had a water break and they went to commercial and it was a big drag.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.720
Why don't they just hit pause?

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.720
It's not wide so then we know when the game's over.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.720
The players are playing like, we have a random amount of time left to score.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.720
Wouldn't it be better if they knew exactly how much time they had left?

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.720
Why?

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:16.720
Why would it be worse if they knew exactly how much time they had left?

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.720
There's a lot of corruption in soccer.

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.720
There's a lot of corruption in soccer is how the explanation is starting.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.720
FIFA's like Chicago politics from the 1800s.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.720
We don't have to go so far back.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:33.720
One is to see how bad of a person you are, how bad of a team you are.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.720
It seems like Italy they just flop around.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.720
This has nothing to do with the question.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.720
No, it does with the clock.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.720
Yeah, they like hammer it up.

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.720
They waste time.

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:47.720
If you know it's 90 minutes, we're ahead by two goals.

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.720
We're just going to eat up the clock and lay on the ground or do a bunch of shit.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.720
Now the referee says no.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.720
You want to lay on the ground.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:55.720
You lay on the ground then we can...

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.720
I don't know.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.720
For me, it is a weird thing.

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.720
There's no other sport that's like, the game will end.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.720
Oh, it ends.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.720
Who the fuck knows?

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.720
I think there's about five minutes left.

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:12.720
There was a piece, I think it was New York Times, something like that I saw,

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:15.720
that ranked the countries by how much time they spent on the ground,

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:17.720
writhing in fake agony.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.720
And it's so interesting.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.720
But the team that won today, the beat Mexico, the Netherlands,

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.720
they weren't even in the top 20, I don't think.

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.720
They just do not flop and don't spend time writhing around on the ground.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.720
Brazil, number one.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:33.720
Because South American teams, Central American teams,

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.720
and also parts of like the Spanish leagues, Italian leagues,

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.720
there's a big culture of just fucking like...

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:42.720
There's a great thing on YouTube where there's people doing flops

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.720
and they have like a crosshairs, like a sniper.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.720
Oh, yeah.

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:46.720
I saw that.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.720
There's people going, oh, falling down.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:51.720
There's a crosshairs and a bullet, the sound goes off.

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:54.720
There's no one anywhere near them, it's really good.

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:56.720
Okay, so because they flop...

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.720
That's just another aspect of the game, right, is what you're saying?

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.720
It's like its own kind of...

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.720
No, but I don't get how that has to do with the clock.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.720
Well, I mean, you have actual injuries that happen in soccer,

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.720
so that's why you have to extra time.

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.720
That's why it's added on when...

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.720
But why don't they just pause when the injuries happen?

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.720
Because then I think people would use...

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.720
The ball's really never dead, like there's not like a lot of dead ball situations,

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.720
like in basketball where the whistle blows and there's lots of breaks

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:23.720
and everyone has a drink of water.

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.720
In soccer, you just play, you keep going.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.720
It's fucking amazing.

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.720
If you watch NBA or college, in the last few minutes,

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.720
it's nothing but commercials.

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.720
No, it's great, but why don't they just pause the clock?

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.720
They don't have to...

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.720
They have commercials.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.720
That's such a...

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:38.720
That's a false dichotomy.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:39.720
You don't...

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.720
You don't...

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.720
The alternative isn't, I guess we're going to have to buy a lot of commercials

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.720
and shove them into these breaks.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.720
Yeah.

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:49.720
I'm not even saying breaks where someone falls down.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.720
You play for 45 minutes and if there's been an injury

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.720
or if there's been lots of substitutions, they add 30 seconds for this,

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.720
a minute for that and they add it up and...

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.720
And nobody knows what that number is.

01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.720
The officials do.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.720
There's one guy.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.720
The fourth official saying that we're going to give you 30 seconds

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.720
for the substitution, 30 seconds for this penalty kick,

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.720
a minute for that injury.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:11.720
The officials know, but game not recognized clock.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:16.720
Wow.

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:19.720
World's best callback.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.720
That was sitting on that egg for 10 minutes.

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.720
That was a world cup of callbacks.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:29.720
So, Dr. Tumer is raising his hand.

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.720
The real answer is like FIFA has never been known for embracing change.

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:35.720
FIFA doesn't embrace change.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.720
It took a point of while to embrace goal line technology.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.720
Goal line technology?

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:43.720
Why are you guys talking about this?

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.720
You just walked in, sir.

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.720
I saw you walk in.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.720
We're at a show.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:51.720
I had to get a drink.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:52.720
Okay.

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.720
So, you had to get up and get a drink,

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.720
but now we're doing the show wrong because you came back in

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.720
and we're talking about soccer, not to your liking.

01:19:58.720 --> 01:19:59.720
But you're talking about it wrong.

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.720
Oh.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.720
Who's this fancy gentleman?

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.720
It's like I had a linen suit.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:06.720
I know.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.720
I know he likes to drink.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.720
Yes, in the front row?

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:11.720
You're right.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.720
You're more virginity losing story.

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:18.720
Well, there can be only one.

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.720
No, I've got screen.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:24.720
That was my only condom virginity.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.720
My couch virginity.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.720
Which is just me fucking couching.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.720
We were watching...

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:33.720
What was your cantaloupe virginity?

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:36.720
How old were you during the first cantaloupe you fucked?

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:39.720
Are we talking honeydew, watermelon?

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.720
Cantaloupe.

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:42.720
Because I was a hell of a honeydew.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:43.720
Oh, dear God.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:46.720
We were watching a documentary about this church quiz

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.720
that these kids do.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.720
There's all these Christian teens are talking about.

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:51.720
One of them was saying,

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.720
I haven't kissed a boy yet,

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.720
but I lost my hand genity two years ago.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.720
And Aaron and I thought,

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.720
we're like, Aaron was so...

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.720
She's like, he won't let you kiss him,

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.720
but he made you jerk him off in a car?

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.720
Like, what kind of fucked up shit?

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.720
And it was like, it was ten minutes later

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:10.720
that we figured out that she meant...

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:11.720
The masturbation?

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:12.720
No, that she held...

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.720
Holding hands with a boy.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:15.720
What?

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.720
That's fucking disturbing.

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:20.720
Oh, wow.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.720
We immediately thought she meant hand job.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:23.720
Yeah, that she fucking...

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.720
I thought masturbation.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.720
Anyway, so speaking of Aaron,

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:29.720
she's not here tonight.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.720
Helder, would you be willing to play?

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.720
Do you ever listen to the podcast?

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:36.720
If you listen to us play Dungeons & Dragons?

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.720
No, but have you heard us play it?

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.720
Like, you can...

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.720
Okay.

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:43.720
You're a doctor, you figure it out.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.720
Aaron's at a party celebrating the...

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.720
I think the new season of Drunk History,

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.720
which she's a part of,

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.720
her episode has got

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:56.720
John Lithgow and Chris Parnell and Winona Ryder.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.720
What a name, wow.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.720
I haven't seen it, but I'm really looking forward to it.

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:02.720
Wow.

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.720
It's a Benedict Arnold...

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.720
She tells a story about Benedict Arnold.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.720
And I heard that which...

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.720
I think she was telling me,

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:12.720
Weird Elle Yankovic plays Hitler this season.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:14.720
That's great.

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.720
Yeah, somebody tells a story about

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.720
Hitler and Weird Elle Yankovic.

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.720
Does he cut his hair off?

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:21.720
That's what I asked, and then Aaron mocked me

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:22.720
and said, you know, they have these things

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:23.720
called wigs, and I was like,

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.720
you can't make long hair into short hair

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.720
with a wig, and she said, yes you can.

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.720
He's got too much hair to put a fucking

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.720
like a Hitler hair on.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.720
Maybe he cut it.

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.720
Maybe that'll be Weird Elle's new look,

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.720
because he kind of never went back

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.720
from his Qui-John hair.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.720
He kind of did that, and then he was like...

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.720
Qui-John?

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:43.720
Was it like Qui-Gon?

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.720
Qui-Gon Gin?

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:45.720
Oh, okay.

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.720
I don't know.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.720
Anyways, whatever.

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:48.720
She's not here.

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.720
We're replacing her with a...

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:50.720
Spencer, will you hand this out to Dan?

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.720
You want to pass down the character sheets?

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:53.720
Yeah.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.720
Yeah.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.720
I am kind of interested in finding out

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.720
why that guy was saying we were talking about it wrong.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:22:59.720
He didn't like to hear about sports.

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:00.720
He was trying to...

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.720
He seems like bad news to me.

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:06.720
Maybe we were using our hands too much.

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:11.720
But I will say, I did also wonder

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.720
why we were talking about soccer for like 30 minutes.

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:15.720
I fucking like soccer.

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.720
Also, I bet some...

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:17.720
Someone's got to...

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.720
I bet a guy a hundred dollars,

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.720
because he's being an asshole.

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.720
I bet a guy a hundred bucks on the

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.720
Mexico Netherlands game.

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:24.720
I never bet on sports.

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.720
I'll never do it again, because it was stupid.

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.720
I'm not rooting against Mexico.

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.720
But this guy was just being an asshole,

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.720
so I bet him I didn't get his name

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.720
and I'll never see him again.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.720
I have no idea who it was.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:35.720
And I guarantee...

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:38.720
Did you meet him at an airport?

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:39.720
If you were at an airport,

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.720
you would have gotten this phone number.

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.720
You've never just...

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.720
You've never met people at a bar?

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.720
You've never just struck up conversation with people?

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:45.720
I've never just talked to random...

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.720
If people start talking to me,

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.720
I'm like, what the fuck do you want?

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:52.720
I don't have it.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:53.720
I'm going, people ask me anything.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:54.720
I don't have it.

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.720
You meet interesting people at bars,

01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.720
especially at airport bars,

01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:58.720
because people are coming and going,

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.720
and it's very fascinating to me.

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:01.720
I agree.

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.720
I agree.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.720
If somebody starts chatting me up,

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.720
I won't hold the shoulder in public,

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:10.720
but yeah, I don't...

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.720
Emily will do this on an airplane.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:13.720
She has this rule,

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.720
so it was me, it was me in the aisle,

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:16.720
her in the middle,

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.720
and the person at this old lady at the window.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.720
And we sat down and she's like,

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.720
you have to right away establish

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.720
what the tone is going to be.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.720
So this lady looked at Emily and was like,

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:27.720
where are you going?

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:29.720
And Emily just sat there stone-faced,

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:32.720
and the old lady asked her three times,

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.720
and Emily just fucking bitter-lip

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.720
and was like, I'm going to power through this,

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.720
said nothing, and it was a great flight.

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.720
Not for the old lady.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.720
Not for that lady.

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:46.720
Who gives a fuck what the old lady wants?

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.720
I do.

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.720
Okay, well take the middle seat from Emily

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.720
and get her phone number.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.720
Can Emily's phone number?

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:55.720
Have you?

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.720
Yeah, I'll give you Emily.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.720
You guys are striking up conversations.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.720
You're the problem, you're that guy.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:04.720
No, no, no.

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.720
On a flight, on a flight,

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.720
I don't want jibber jabber.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.720
I don't want to be like, hey, it's cool.

01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:10.720
What are you doing?

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:11.720
On the plane,

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.720
I want absolute fucking graveyard silence on a flight.

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:14.720
Right, okay, good.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:16.720
But you're at the fucking airport bar,

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:19.720
you're just going, so where are you going?

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:20.720
You don't do that.

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.720
But sometimes conversation comes up,

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.720
and you find out that people are just having a good old time.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.720
Yeah.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.720
Yeah, see?

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:30.720
Some people are curious about the people sitting next to them.

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:33.720
And also, I could not care less.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.720
But you're a comedian.

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:38.720
Wouldn't you benefit from mining,

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.720
like human experiences?

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.720
Yeah, no, I talked to a guy once,

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.720
and I got three hours of material out of it.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.720
You're a fucking sociopath.

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:53.720
I'm not saying you go up there and you grab everybody's ass,

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.720
it's not seeing you fucking harangue.

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.720
Sometimes conversation starts.

01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:58.720
I actively block them.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.720
I swat away attempts at conversation.

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:01.720
A hundred percent.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.720
That doesn't seem like you.

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.720
You're a very garrulous, like chatty guy.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:08.720
Yeah, but not with fucking people I don't know.

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.720
Like, Helder, you're a great guy.

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.720
If you sat up next to me and were like, what's up?

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.720
I would like just fucking stare straight in front of me

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.720
until you left.

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.720
What's up?

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.720
He wouldn't say it, see?

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.720
Great.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.720
I don't get it.

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.720
I mean, look, my girlfriend's Scottish,

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:29.720
we went to Scotland, she kept it cute.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.720
She was like, Jeff, when you go to Scotland,

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.720
you can't just go out there and meet Jeff Davis and say,

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.720
hello, how do you do to every fucking person?

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:37.720
Like, they'll fucking hate you.

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:39.720
I'm like, they're gonna love me.

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:41.720
And then I was walking down the fucking street,

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:43.720
Christmas day, or Christmas Eve day,

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.720
I'm walking down the road and I see her father outside.

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:47.720
And I see him, I'm leaving him.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.720
I want to go get Kate a little gift and have breakfast on my own.

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:51.720
And I come back and I see him talking to a dude.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.720
And he's talking to a buddy of his, a small town

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.720
outside of Edinburgh.

01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:57.720
And they're talking.

01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.720
So I see him and he goes, hey, Jeff, what are you up to?

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.720
And I'm like, oh, I did this, I did that.

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:03.720
And there's a guy standing, like, right the foot away from me.

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.720
And he and Andy, her dad and I are talking for a while.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.720
And he's like, so later on we'll do this, we'll do that.

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.720
And I say, oh, we're just chatting.

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.720
And I turn to the guy next to me because it's weird

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.720
that I haven't been introduced.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.720
But they clearly know each other.

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:17.720
I go, hi, I'm Jeff. He goes, oh, I'm Craig.

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:19.720
Hey, Craig, whatever his name was. And we shake hands.

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:21.720
I get back in the house and Kate's father's like,

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.720
there's Jeff walking down the road.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:25.720
Just saying, how do you do?

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:27.720
Oh, good morning.

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.720
I was like, you fucking, there's a guy standing there.

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.720
Like, like, introduce him.

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.720
And he goes, Jeff, we just don't do that.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.720
And I go, it's called having a personality, Andy.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:39.720
Well, you ruined Craig's day.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.720
Craig liked it.

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.720
Craig's still talking about it.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.720
Also, people he fucking knows.

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.720
He found out.

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:49.720
So then we go, we go to Kate's families.

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.720
They meet at the borders because some of her families

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.720
in England and some of her families in Scotland.

01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.720
So they meet at the Scottish English borders.

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:57.720
And we, Dan, and Aaron and I, and Kate,

01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.720
we all go to the, to Hadrian's wall.

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.720
You know, some famous old Roman wall, you know,

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:03.720
and shit. So we're looking at some history,

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.720
but it was all closed because it was Boxing Day.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.720
It's all the tourist centers are closed.

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:09.720
So we go back to the house. It's everybody there.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:11.720
It's a family. There's a few Americans there, us,

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:13.720
and everyone else is Kate's family.

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.720
We meet everybody because we've been there for two days.

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.720
There's a guy that comes in who works with her mother.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.720
I don't know this guy. We're standing in the foyer

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.720
and he's shaking off his umbrella.

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.720
And I go, hi, I'm Jeff. He goes, hi, my name is Craig,

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.720
because they're all Craig for some fucking reason.

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.720
Everyone's named Craig.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.720
And we meet and he goes, he's asking me questions.

01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:31.720
He's like, what have you been doing since you've been here?

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.720
I said, well, we went to Hadrian's.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.720
I said, oh, what part did you go to?

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.720
I said, it was this part, but it was closed.

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:39.720
And he's telling me all about Hadrian's wall.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.720
And he was going in this big, expansive monologue

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.720
about why this happened.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:45.720
And I asked him questions and he's following up.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.720
And then fucking Kate's dad comes in.

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:49.720
Oh, there's Jeff again.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.720
Fucking how do you do?

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:53.720
I'm like, fuck you.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.720
It'd be so funny if it was like sixth sense

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.720
where we actually see what's happening

01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:59.720
and it's just you talking to this guy.

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:01.720
And he's all fucked up.

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:03.720
Yeah, and the other guy's just trying to get away.

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.720
Kate wanted me to say,

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:07.720
if you fucking talk to Granny, Granny will fucking murder you.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.720
She fucking, like Granny hates everybody.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.720
I'm like, Granny's love me.

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.720
I'm fucking great with a grandparent.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:15.720
She's like, Granny hates everyone.

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:17.720
Like fucking Jenny with Granny.

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.720
And fucking that Granny, guess what?

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.720
Best fucking friends. She fucking love me.

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:23.720
That's what she thinks.

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:25.720
She did.

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:27.720
Actually, Kate, later on, she's like, Granny loves you.

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:29.720
She's like, she hates everybody else, but she loves you.

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:31.720
I was like, yeah, because she hasn't been spoken to.

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.720
Because you guys are a bunch of terse weirdos.

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.720
Fucking make an effort, cock-suckers.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.720
All right, speaking of making an effort,

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.720
let's make an effort to play some D&D, shall we?

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.720
Woo!

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.720
When we last met,

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.720
our heroes had yet again escaped

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.720
Admiral Darkstar's clutches.

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.720
Thanks to Mulraine and her rope,

01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:57.720
our heroes were saved, escaping certain death.

01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.720
Back to Bill Martinians,

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:01.720
the city that's everywhere.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.720
After returning to the ruined Seekers hideout,

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:05.720
the party grew bored and

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.720
discussed Chris de Burgh's genital reattachment,

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.720
but ultimately found themselves

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.720
in a gnomish bar known as the Rusty Buckle.

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:13.720
After much journeying,

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:15.720
our heroes were weary and

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.720
sought the comfort of the pub,

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.720
but inside, upon seeing a wondrous

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.720
gnome golem decided to steal it,

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:23.720
and after a tense robbery,

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.720
the party got cold feet

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.720
and returned the stolen golem.

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:29.720
But they were still interrupted

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:31.720
by a specter from Quark's sordid past.

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:33.720
The Cactus Bunch

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:35.720
had resurfaced.

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:37.720
The gnomish gangsters attacked our party,

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:39.720
but together our heroes slaughtered them all,

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.720
and after a brilliant speech by Sharpie,

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.720
they robbed the remaining gnomes

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.720
and set fire to the pub,

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.720
walking off into the foreground

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.720
like badasses.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:53.720
But would they really just escape,

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.720
scot-free? Is an arson a crime?

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:57.720
And what if the Cactus Bunch

01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:59.720
or the Robot Baby

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.720
find out in an all-new exciting episode

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.720
of Harmontown?

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.720
Me.

01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:11.720
So, I wasn't here last week. I was disappointed.

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:13.720
It sounded like we didn't steal the Robot Baby,

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.720
but what he actually did was, we killed everyone

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.720
and took all the Robot Baby.

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.720
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.720
You and Aaron went nuts

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:23.720
the first time, and then the

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:25.720
following week, I was...

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.720
Harming a Robot Baby is not nuts.

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:29.720
But stealing it from people

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.720
is crazy.

01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.720
You went on a speech that now we're going to be bad guys

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.720
and steal everything from everybody.

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:37.720
Well, I have to justify this narrative somehow.

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:39.720
Okay, fine.

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.720
We're chaotic evil now.

01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:43.720
We're bad people now.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:45.720
I think we're chaotic neutral.

01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.720
I'd say that's right, yeah.

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:49.720
We've been bad for a long time.

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.720
Thanks, Spencer. You're chaotic something.

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.720
All right, so do we have this Robot Golem, baby?

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:55.720
Yes. What's the name of it?

01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:57.720
Well, I don't know.

01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:59.720
What's the name of it?

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:01.720
Heldor.

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:03.720
Can we name it Heldor?

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.720
H-E-L-D-E-R?

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.720
All right, you have to think about it.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:09.720
What are you lying to us about?

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:13.720
It's all different in Portuguese.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:15.720
Do you think when Heldor grows up,

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.720
he'll just be a giant

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:19.720
simpleton that only says Heldor?

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.720
Heldor.

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.720
Heldor.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:25.720
Heldor.

01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.720
Remember when Heldor...

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.720
It's my least favorite part of Game of Thrones.

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:31.720
It's a whole storyline

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.720
with the fucking kids and the magic trees.

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:35.720
It's like...

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:37.720
But I remember when Heldor looked down a well

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:39.720
and was like,

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.720
Heldor!

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:43.720
It's so hard to not...

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:45.720
It's just Timmy from South Park.

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:47.720
That's all it is.

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:49.720
What a great gig as an actor, though.

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:51.720
What are my lines?

01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:53.720
Also, unlike Timmy from South Park,

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:55.720
it's revealed at some point that someone says,

01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.720
it's not his name, you know.

01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.720
It's just the sound he makes.

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.720
It's not his name. His name's like Frank or something.

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.720
That's like Anyang from

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.720
the rest of development kind of stuff.

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.720
Do you know that guy?

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.720
By the way, every actor

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:11.720
on Game of Thrones is also a house DJ.

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:15.720
Heldor is a DJ.

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:17.720
Grey Worm is a DJ.

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:19.720
Dinklage is a DJ?

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.720
Is he?

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:23.720
No.

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:25.720
Well, he's American, but all...

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.720
90% of the cast has like...

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:29.720
That's not true.

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:31.720
Look it up.

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.720
He's got star tattoos.

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:35.720
Sweet.

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.720
I would definitely, if I had to choose between two raves

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.720
and one was being spun by Heldor

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:43.720
and the other had like foam coming down

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:45.720
from the ceiling, I'd be like...

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.720
It'd be so funny if it's just popular songs

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.720
but the words are all replaced with Heldor.

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:57.720
Heldor.

01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:59.720
I don't know why you'd sing it like...

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.720
It sounded like Johnny Cash or something.

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.720
Heldor.

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.720
Yeah.

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.720
I got a mean bad Heldor going down

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.720
a 57 Chevy.

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.720
I got a mean bad Heldor.

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.720
It's going down the Chevy?

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.720
Yep.

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.720
The Chevy's so big

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.720
it's got an elevator in it.

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:23.720
Heldor.

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:25.720
Heldor.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.720
I examine our surroundings, Spencer.

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.720
So behind you is a flaming

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.720
domicile. It's the pub.

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.720
It's on fire.

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:35.720
Around you are other stores

01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.720
but they do look close enough

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:39.720
that they might also catch on fire.

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.720
Oh boy.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.720
But they're not yet.

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:45.720
None of these stores are marked.

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.720
It's kind of not the best part of town, you could tell.

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:49.720
There's broken windows and stuff.

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:51.720
And one of them is on fire.

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.720
And one of the building is on fire, yeah.

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:55.720
Clear sign of poverty.

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.720
Do we have any

01:34:57.720 --> 01:34:59.720
do we have any aim right now?

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.720
We just kind of finished

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:03.720
a little bit of a mission, right?

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:05.720
We got this golem baby.

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:07.720
It's one of those rare delightful

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:09.720
parts of a D&D campaign where you can kind of

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:11.720
you get to really

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:13.720
we get to do whatever we want.

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:15.720
If we wait too long

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:17.720
he's going to have a pterodactyl guy

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:19.720
come out and go, pterodactylons

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:21.720
need your help.

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.720
But if we're smart about this

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.720
we can fucking...

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.720
I go to the building most

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:29.720
adjacent to the fire and since this building

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:31.720
is probably going to burn down I just go examine it

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:33.720
and see what's in there.

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.720
I'm trying to make looting sound gentlemanly.

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:39.720
Since this building is about to catch fire

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.720
I believe I'll peruse its wares.

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:45.720
It's an active opportunity.

01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:47.720
What did you say about the opportunity?

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.720
I put my finger in his butt just in case

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:51.720
we don't get sued later on.

01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:53.720
So yeah, you go over to the building

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:55.720
and you smell an overwhelming stench of fish.

01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.720
You enter the door

01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.720
and you can tell no one's been here

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.720
in quite a while. The air just seems still

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.720
with the coating of dust all over everything

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:05.720
and the smell is just way worse

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:07.720
in here. You can see there's piles

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.720
of... they look just kind of like brown

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:11.720
putrid stuff. They're gathered with flies

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:13.720
and maggots.

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:15.720
Oh, it's probably robot baby food. We should feed this.

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.720
I was going to say

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:19.720
let's send the robot baby into Scout the...

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:21.720
Yeah.

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:23.720
Hell or...

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:25.720
Robot baby isn't activated yet.

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.720
We have to find a little discipline.

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.720
It's not activated.

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:31.720
It's like a baby we're walking around with.

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.720
All right.

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.720
I get out of the dead fish store.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.720
How do we activate the baby? I'm sorry.

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:39.720
There's a disc-shaped hole in its chest

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.720
that we have to find some sort of thing

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.720
that probably plugs into that.

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.720
Like a CD kind of thing?

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.720
Yeah, kind of like a little saucer-shaped thing

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:49.720
like a CD.

01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:51.720
I poke my head into the deserted fish store

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.720
and say, hold on.

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.720
That happens.

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.720
And then I say,

01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:59.720
there's some DJing.

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:01.720
I go to the building...

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.720
Slayers haven't been invented yet, so...

01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:05.720
I go to the building next to the dead fish store.

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:07.720
All right. This one, it looks like

01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:09.720
some sort of barbershop.

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:11.720
There's an old gnome.

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:13.720
He's got orange hair that's styled pretty nicely.

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:15.720
And he's got

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:17.720
small little glasses on his face

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:19.720
and he's just sweeping up.

01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:21.720
I say,

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.720
sir, there's a fire.

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.720
A couple doors down. You might want to get out of here.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:27.720
Oh yeah, of course.

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:29.720
You would go talk to the random people.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.720
Oh, sir.

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.720
Where are you going today?

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:43.720
Look, I'm a gnome,

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:45.720
and we're chatty.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:47.720
We like talking to people.

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.720
Cigarettes and riddles, baby.

01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:51.720
So,

01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:53.720
you say that to the gnome

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.720
and he's like,

01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:57.720
whoa, thanks.

01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.720
You seem awful casual about this.

01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:01.720
I'm trying to warn you. There's a fire.

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:03.720
Yeah, no, I appreciate that.

01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:05.720
It just seemed your tone was like,

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:07.720
hey, man, it's sunny outside,

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:09.720
but this is a fire you're talking about.

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:11.720
I'm not so worried right now.

01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:13.720
It's how casual you are.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.720
You're the one being casual. I said fire,

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:17.720
and you're being all prosaic and shit.

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:19.720
I'm just vibing off of your energies.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:21.720
I'll fucking

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:23.720
make you leak, motherfucker.

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.720
I'm just trying to

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:27.720
chat.

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:29.720
I'll slash you wide open.

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:31.720
You want to die in a fire? I'm trying to help you out.

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:33.720
I'm appreciating that, man.

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:35.720
You have a very weird way of saying you're appreciating it.

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.720
I just thought it was a weird way you brought it up.

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:39.720
You're being weird.

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.720
See, that's just what happens

01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:43.720
when you talk to strangers.

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:45.720
Can I get your phone number?

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:47.720
You see?

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:49.720
No, but

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:51.720
he's just like, thanks.

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.720
I guess, thanks.

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:55.720
Okay, fuck it. I'm sorry I came in.

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.720
Enjoy your barbershop. You're going to fucking die here.

01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:59.720
If I saw a fire,

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:01.720
I would have been all like,

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:03.720
there's a fire! You got to get out of here!

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:05.720
Well, the fire's been there a long time.

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:07.720
You sweeping ass motherfucker.

01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:09.720
We've adjusted to it.

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:11.720
We did that.

01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.720
We went, fire, fire!

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.720
I was talking to him.

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:17.720
I was operating under the assumption.

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:19.720
Look, first of all, you have a barbershop next to a dead fish place.

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:21.720
Which is fucking...

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:23.720
You stopped carrying a long time ago.

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:27.720
Sidebar?

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.720
Campaners?

01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:31.720
Yeah.

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:33.720
Why are we hanging out in the town that we

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.720
murdered and

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:37.720
set fire to?

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:39.720
Let's go to another town.

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.720
This is all shitty fish stores.

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.720
Can we go through that toilet bucket

01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:45.720
thing that gets us to the portal thing?

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.720
Doesn't that take us to the place where

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.720
Admiral Dirk Stark at Sinking Island

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:51.720
is? I don't know.

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.720
It was paradise.

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:55.720
We destroyed that like everything we touch.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:57.720
That is now gone.

01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:59.720
We put up a parking lot.

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:01.720
Put up a parking lot.

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:03.720
I say this sooner we get out of this weird ass town.

01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:05.720
We have to find a new place that we haven't yet ruined.

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:07.720
Okay.

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.720
Let's go ruin a new place.

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:11.720
Is there

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:13.720
the equivalent of a Palm Springs

01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:15.720
depot or a bus station

01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:17.720
so we can embark on a new thing?

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:19.720
How do people travel out of here quickly?

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.720
Orange hair.

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.720
You don't see anything like that.

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.720
You haven't seen anything like that since you arrived here.

01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:27.720
I'm asking Orange hair.

01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:29.720
Orange hair.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:31.720
Oh, he's gone. He left.

01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:33.720
We're still in this store?

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.720
Yeah, well there's a fire.

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.720
Everyone's super casual

01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.720
about it.

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:41.720
I turn to the rest of the group.

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:43.720
I go, look,

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.720
that's a complicated dude.

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.720
If I ever see him, I'm probably going to kill him.

01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.720
I loot his store.

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:51.720
I look around and try to loot his store.

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.720
You find three scissors and six combs.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.720
I fucking take all of that shit.

01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.720
I put one in my hair like an afro pick

01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:59.720
and fucking walk out

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.720
like a blackploitation style.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.720
Shit.

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.720
Yeah, it looks like that.

01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:07.720
I wrap wax paper around one of the combs

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.720
and I make a homemade kazoo.

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:13.720
It's both fun

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:15.720
and family friendly.

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:17.720
I whip out my non-dick

01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:19.720
and piss on the floor.

01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:21.720
It just drips down your leg.

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:25.720
Hey, this is how it is now.

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.720
Let's get to the center of town, you guys

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:31.720
take a second way out of here.

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.720
Is there a downtown?

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:35.720
Center of town, why not get out of town?

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.720
Can I ask a weird question?

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:39.720
Does a robot baby have a robot dick?

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:41.720
No.

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.720
You can't have the baby's dick.

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:47.720
We're not potato people.

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:49.720
You can't just switch parts.

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:51.720
I just wanted to see if it was...

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:53.720
Anyway, let's go to the town center.

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.720
Why are we going to the center of the town

01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:57.720
that we want to get out of?

01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.720
Maybe there's a fucking airport or some shit.

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:01.720
We have to leave.

01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:03.720
What do you propose? Where should we go?

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:05.720
The opposite direction of the havoc we've caused.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:07.720
Let's go.

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.720
Let's get the fuck out of Bill Martigan's right now.

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:11.720
Yeah, you lead the way.

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.720
Charge! We go north.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.720
You go north as you get through

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:17.720
as you work your way through Bill Martigan's

01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.720
the buildings get closer and closer together

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.720
you find it there's less and less roads

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:23.720
it's harder and harder to get out of this place

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:25.720
and you manage to squeeze yourself

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.720
past several skinny alleys

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:29.720
and you come to

01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:31.720
what looks like a large, large wall

01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.720
that stretches up as high as the eye can see.

01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:35.720
It's like a video game.

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:37.720
We got a fight.

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:39.720
How the hell do we go back to the entrance?

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.720
Do we still have that staff of that

01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.720
that grows?

01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:45.720
I don't think so.

01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:47.720
Unless there's a different one.

01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:49.720
The first one you had definitely melted.

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:51.720
Maybe I can teleport to the top of the wall

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:53.720
and throw rope down.

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:55.720
Does my teleport keep still out of charge?

01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.720
Yeah, you'd have to sleep.

01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.720
Where's the entrance to the town?

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:01.720
We got in here somehow.

01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:03.720
You came in here through

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:05.720
there's a kind of like an entrance checkpointy place.

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:07.720
Alright, to the checkpoint place.

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:09.720
You head back through all those squishy buildings too.

01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:11.720
The checkpointy place

01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:13.720
and you find

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.720
there's a different bucket

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.720
than the one you saw when you first came here

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:19.720
and there's no gnome on it.

01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:21.720
But it's just like a small clearing

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:23.720
it's fenced off

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:25.720
but behind the fence is the same wall

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:27.720
and notice it looks like it's woven together

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:29.720
like thatched

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:31.720
or something like that.

01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:33.720
This wall, that's tall.

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.720
But does it have a little portal bucket?

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:37.720
There's a bucket.

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:39.720
I stick my head in the bucket.

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.720
It's just a bucket.

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:47.720
There's nobody in there

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:49.720
for you to start conversations with.

01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:51.720
Look

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:53.720
live your life however you want to do it.

01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.720
So when we

01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:57.720
a fucking weird closeted

01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:59.720
antisocial life.

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:01.720
I mean

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:03.720
all this stranger talking has certainly made

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.720
you very friendly.

01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:07.720
I'm being persecuted for

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:09.720
being interested in the other.

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:11.720
I mean

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:13.720
possibly that you can learn something

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:15.720
by meeting other people.

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:17.720
If it makes you happy

01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:19.720
then be happy.

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:21.720
I'm not doing anything.

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:23.720
You are, you're being fucking weird.

01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:25.720
I didn't say

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:27.720
I mean

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:29.720
I have observations about the way Jeff

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.720
manages his

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:33.720
social life.

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.720
Give him experience points.

01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:37.720
How did we

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:39.720
we got into this town?

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:41.720
You climbed in through a bag.

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:43.720
I don't even remember that shit.

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:45.720
Do we still have that bag?

01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:47.720
No, I think it was left on the ground.

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.720
Oh shit.

01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:53.720
Back by the fire? Back in the entrance.

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.720
Where you guys now are.

01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:57.720
Is there a bag? You don't see it.

01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.720
There's a bucket. It's just a fucking regular old bucket.

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:01.720
Yep.

01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:03.720
I say hodor into the bucket.

01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:05.720
That happens.

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:07.720
All right.

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:09.720
This woven, thatchy wall

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:11.720
is blocking our way out.

01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:13.720
Well let's do what we do.

01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:15.720
Let's set it on fire.

01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:19.720
That's our stick now, right?

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:23.720
What in doubt?

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:25.720
Flaming fire sordid or

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:27.720
I go up and I

01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:29.720
try to attack the wall

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:31.720
and make a hole in it.

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:33.720
I bet it's not going to work.

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:35.720
But let's go for it.

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:37.720
Fucking negative Nelly.

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:39.720
Wait, I'm the one proposing that we

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:41.720
not set something on fire.

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:43.720
I'm just trying to chop it.

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:45.720
All right, you miss.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:47.720
You missed a wall?

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:49.720
How did you miss a wall?

01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:51.720
Because I was being heckled by my friends.

01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:55.720
Yeah, he did as you were swinging.

01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:59.720
It's not going to help.

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.720
It's like playing darts with them.

01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.720
Try it again.

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:07.720
You fucking do something.

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.720
I don't have swords. I'm a man of...

01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:11.720
magic.

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:13.720
All right, I cast

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:15.720
Mordenkainen's Thatched Wall

01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:17.720
Destruction.

01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:19.720
You don't know that spell.

01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:21.720
All right,

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:23.720
let's try this.

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:25.720
A very controlled fireball.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.720
You're going to light

01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:29.720
something on fire again, huh?

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.720
How close are you guys

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:33.720
to this wall?

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:35.720
I'm not going to shoot it

01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:37.720
if my friends are standing there.

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:39.720
Everybody back up.

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:41.720
We're going to do try something.

01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.720
We instinctively move away from this fireball.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:45.720
All right.

01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.720
You launch a fireball.

01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:49.720
It's very hard.

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:51.720
It does hit.

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:53.720
Nobody was wringing it.

01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:55.720
It hits.

01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:57.720
It immediately starts catching

01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:59.720
fire from the fireball

01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:01.720
and it spreads in all directions.

01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:05.720
You're welcome.

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.720
We do what we do.

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:11.720
We're really going to get out of here

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:13.720
or I'll go to jail.

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:15.720
The wall continues to burn, spreading out

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:17.720
and you see it starts to catch on fire

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:19.720
some of the buildings nearby

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.720
where you guys are

01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.720
that are touching the wall.

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:25.720
I'm like, hey, who set the wall on fire?

01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:29.720
I think we're good.

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:31.720
Behind this wall, you see another wall.

01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:33.720
It's very similar,

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:35.720
I'd call it like a maroon color.

01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:37.720
But it's also

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.720
the same fibrous material.

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.720
But it's not on fire from this fire?

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:43.720
No, it's kind of like

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:45.720
as this wall is burning away, it's revealing

01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:47.720
this kind of different wall, if that makes sense.

01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:49.720
I think we all know what to do, guys.

01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:53.720
Satay on fire.

01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:57.720
Lightning bolt.

01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:59.720
All right.

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:01.720
You blast it with the lightning bolt

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:03.720
which scorches a small pinpoint

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.720
but it doesn't continue on fire.

01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:07.720
Can I go look in the hole

01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:09.720
to see what's on the other side?

01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.720
Yeah, you look in

01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:13.720
your eye is instantly bitten

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.720
not by bites, but by cold.

01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:19.720
Frost taints your eye

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:21.720
with its coldy grip

01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:23.720
as you look and see nothing but white

01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:25.720
white light all around you

01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:27.720
and then you get hit in the eye by something.

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.720
It's snow.

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:31.720
It's a piece of snow hits you in the eye.

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:33.720
Shit.

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:35.720
Piece of snow?

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:37.720
I think they call it a flake.

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:39.720
Right?

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:41.720
Yeah.

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:43.720
Snowflake.

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:45.720
It hits you in the eye.

01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:47.720
How much damage does it take?

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.720
You notice it, tangibly.

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:51.720
It's just a snowflake.

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.720
It's not painful.

01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:55.720
All right, so we got one wall,

01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.720
system is a statue when it's on fire

01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.720
and then there's the maroon wall

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:01.720
that is impervious to lightning strike.

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:03.720
Well, but we could

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:05.720
also try and set it on fire.

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:07.720
Well, it wasn't impervious.

01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:09.720
It didn't do much damage to it

01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:11.720
and then beyond that it's just snow, snowtown, USA.

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.720
I don't like it.

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:17.720
If we're in a tundra, we can't just walk away.

01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:19.720
The fire on the other parts

01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:21.720
of the wall continue burning

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.720
and spreading on fire more.

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:25.720
I don't think we can hang out here.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:29.720
And we're not going to get a lot of help

01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:31.720
from the locals.

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.720
I mean, they really should not help.

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.720
I look around for that bag

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.720
that we came in through.

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:39.720
You still don't see it.

01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:41.720
Smoke clouds your vision.

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.720
We should have done that before.

01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:45.720
We set the wall on fire.

01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:47.720
Everybody spread out and look for that bag

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.720
that we came in through.

01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:51.720
I really look for it.

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.720
All right.

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.720
Sharpie, you see it's a small box.

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.720
It just catches your eye.

01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:59.720
I got a box over here.

01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:01.720
The rest of you find nothing of value.

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:03.720
John Doe has the upper hand.

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:07.720
What's in the box?

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.720
What's in the box?

01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:15.720
That's Nick Cage.

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.720
I open it carefully with my switchblade.

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:19.720
You open the box and you see,

01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:21.720
it's just a ton of cigarettes.

01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:23.720
I dump them out.

01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:25.720
All right.

01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:29.720
Cigarettes litter the floor.

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:33.720
I keep looking for the bag.

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:35.720
You don't find anything.

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:37.720
What do I find?

01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:39.720
You guys didn't find anything except he found this box of cigarettes.

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:43.720
All right.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:45.720
I smoke one of the cigarettes because I could use a smoke.

01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:47.720
Wasn't there one guy who wanted cigarettes?

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:49.720
Remember him?

01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:51.720
Yeah, so we murdered him.

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.720
Did we murder him?

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:55.720
Probably.

01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.720
Historically speaking, yes.

01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.720
Okay, I'm fucking confused.

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:01.720
Is this a wall?

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.720
Well, we don't want to get out to the tundra, right?

01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:05.720
We don't want to do that.

01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:07.720
I guess not. I mean, we're not really dressed for it.

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:11.720
And there's no way...

01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:13.720
We've said the thing we're in on fire.

01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:15.720
Yeah.

01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:17.720
There is no lesson to be learned from this.

01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:19.720
Well, don't rob people.

01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:21.720
We were so...

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:23.720
What did I do?

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:25.720
We're turning on each other like a Stephen King.

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:29.720
What is my cactus card?

01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:31.720
It's a small card.

01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:33.720
It's laminated.

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:35.720
It says the cactus bunch.

01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:37.720
And my little painted stick,

01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:39.720
we never figured out what that did, right?

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:41.720
Nope.

01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.720
I cast acid splash on the maroon,

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.720
where are you aiming it?

01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:47.720
At the pinhole

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:49.720
where my lightning bolts...

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:51.720
So you do that and it splashes

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:53.720
and you see sizzling

01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:55.720
and little bits of smoke as it

01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:57.720
kind of spreads this hole wider.

01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:59.720
It's maybe now the size of a head-sized hole.

01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:01.720
It's just still seeing white.

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:03.720
Now a bit of snow is kind of coming in.

01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:07.720
Sounds great.

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:09.720
I have three vials of acid.

01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:11.720
Can I throw those on there?

01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:13.720
Sure, yeah.

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:15.720
What do you guys think?

01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:17.720
Using the remaining acid in your possession,

01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:19.720
you acid up an entire man-sized hole

01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:21.720
big enough for someone to fit through,

01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:23.720
like a man

01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:25.720
or a woman.

01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:27.720
I go through it with my cloak of resistance on.

01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:29.720
You do that.

01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:31.720
Is anyone else going to do anything?

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:33.720
Oh, I have boots of wintry mite.

01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:35.720
Yeah.

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:37.720
So I put those on

01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:39.720
and I go out

01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:41.720
and I'm like, hey, I've got your boots.

01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:45.720
Two winter?

01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:47.720
Oh, okay.

01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:49.720
You guys, you both exit

01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:51.720
and you see as you step out

01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:53.720
you feel your body changing

01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:55.720
and as you step out,

01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:57.720
you see on the floor a bag

01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:59.720
with a hole in it.

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:01.720
Bag!

01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:03.720
Is this our bag?

01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:05.720
You see smoke issuing out of it.

01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:07.720
Oh, fuck you.

01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:09.720
Did we acid the bag?

01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:11.720
No.

01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:13.720
It's a bag on fire too or whatever's in there.

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:15.720
I look in the bag.

01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:17.720
You poke your head in the bag

01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:19.720
and you see Bill Martigan's

01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:21.720
and Sharpie and Moran and shit

01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:23.720
and a fire all over the place.

01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:25.720
What the fuck?

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:27.720
We're just back where we started from?

01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:29.720
No, you're in the snow.

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:31.720
Outside there's a bag and it's a portal

01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:33.720
to just inside what we set on fire.

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.720
Alright, I pick up the bag.

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:37.720
You guys are still inside this fire.

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:39.720
I have some kind of resist

01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:41.720
hellscape. Anybody have to have any ideas

01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:43.720
what we should do right now?

01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:45.720
Throw snow in the bag.

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:47.720
Throw snow in the bag.

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.720
You're gonna put out the fire.

01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:51.720
How much snow are we gonna throw in the bag?

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:53.720
All of it.

01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:55.720
I take a handful of snow and I throw it in the bag.

01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:57.720
You take a handful of snow

01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:59.720
and throw it into the bag.

01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:01.720
Sharpie, a handful of snow

01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:03.720
comes and falls onto the floor.

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:05.720
That's great.

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:07.720
Yeah.

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:09.720
Really fixed everything.

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:11.720
I'm coming out.

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.720
I go out through the hole.

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:15.720
I know I had some kind of resist

01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:17.720
elements.

01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:19.720
I think all of you have cloaks of resistance.

01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:21.720
We'll put them all on.

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:23.720
Come on, Heldor, as

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:25.720
Christopher.

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.720
Do we see anything?

01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:29.720
You see nothing. It's all tundra style.

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:31.720
Wait a second.

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:33.720
The brightness of the tundra is moving

01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:35.720
towards you.

01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:37.720
Looks like a large humanoid figure

01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:39.720
maybe about seven or eight feet tall.

01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:41.720
This would probably be an ally.

01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:45.720
Right?

01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:47.720
Someone that will help us out.

01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:49.720
Why don't you go up there and...

01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:51.720
I go up there and I go, hey, how's it going?

01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:53.720
I introduce myself to her.

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.720
How do you do?

01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:57.720
I'm Quark.

01:54:57.720 --> 01:54:59.720
I introduce myself to who knows who.

01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:01.720
It's pretty far off,

01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:03.720
but you do that

01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:05.720
and it shuffles closer to you.

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:07.720
It seems like a big

01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:09.720
hairy man

01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:11.720
sort of thing covered in white fur.

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:13.720
These things are always misunderstood.

01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:15.720
It's like a Yeti

01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:17.720
situation.

01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:19.720
But like a Harry Henderson kind of Yeti.

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:21.720
It's a hairy.

01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:23.720
Yo-ho!

01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:25.720
We love you!

01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:27.720
It continues to draw closer.

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:29.720
We don't judge you for being a monster.

01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:31.720
Oh, don't use the M word!

01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:35.720
That's their word!

01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:41.720
Are you human-splaining?

01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:43.720
The M word.

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.720
Alright, well, yeah.

01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:47.720
Hello, hello, hello.

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:49.720
Hello.

01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:51.720
My name's Sharpie Butzalad.

01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:53.720
I love you. You're a Yeti.

01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:55.720
You're super intelligent

01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:57.720
and misunderstood and you're going to help us out.

01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.720
The Yeti continues

01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:01.720
drawing nearer

01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:03.720
and then you see it move its arm

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:05.720
and a large frozen neck

01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:07.720
comes over all of your bodies.

01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:09.720
Oh.

01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:11.720
He's giving us a blanket with holes in it.

01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:15.720
Cliff Hanger!

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:19.720
Thank you, Heldor.

01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:21.720
Heldor, everybody.

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:23.720
Hello, consultants.

01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:25.720
Thank you, Guy, that was bored with the soccer talk.

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:27.720
Thank you very much.

01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:29.720
I agree.

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:31.720
Thank you, uh...

01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:33.720
Who else talked?

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.720
Kumail Nanjiani, Tumor Boy.

01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:37.720
Tumor Boy?

01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:39.720
Promote the X-Files podcast again?

01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:41.720
X-Files on Ferro.

01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:43.720
We talk about X-Files. Dan Stunnery's going to do it again.

01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:45.720
Listen to it.

01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:47.720
Thank you very much, everybody. Spencer Crittenden.

01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:49.720
Kumail Nanjiani. I'm Jeff Davis.

01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:51.720
One more time for the mayor, Dan Harmon.
