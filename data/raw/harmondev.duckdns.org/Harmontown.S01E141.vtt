00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Commerce and the Meltdown Theater, Harmontown is now in session.

00:12.000 --> 00:24.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:24.000 --> 00:46.000
Thank you very much. I was minecrafting. I'm not really ready to do the show.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
What happened recently on Minecraft? Get us up to date on where you were as you left Minecraft.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
I have a new base that I built up in the sky. It's a cube of marble.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
And inside of it is a glass room with these powered spawners that creates zombies that bring zombies into the world.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
And then there's these machines on all sides that immediately murder them.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
And then all of their brains and flesh go through conduits into a central chest underneath that chamber.

01:17.000 --> 01:27.000
And then I just finished making an elaborate system that like a serial killer's elaborate turn of the century world fair murder castle

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
sorts their armor off and melts it down into gold and anything that they were carrying.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
It's just sorted all out.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
And then you take their flesh and their flesh gets teleported into a tesseract that funnels down into these vats

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
and is combined with sugar from these fields of cane that I had growing on the roof of my cube.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
So the cube is a cube of marble with sugar cane growing on the roof.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
And it's just being constantly harvested and that gets turned into sugar.

01:58.000 --> 02:06.000
And the sugar is combined with the zombie flesh and forms a nutrient juice that powers my whole operation.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
I have these generators. Thank you. Thank you. You should applaud.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
Welcome to Nuremberg 1939.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Harvesting flesh to power your...

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
It does make you feel a little... I mean they're zombies.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
But they were created by me.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
Like I did summon them into the world with my machine only to harvest their flesh and brains and stuff.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Is this part of a menu that happens when you first get the game?

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
No, no. It's probably a lot of mod packs. I've told you I'm playing the... I told you, Jeff.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Damn, we don't talk as much as we used to.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
It's the Beast Infinity mod pack. It's if you're interested in it.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
So you summon zombies only to murder them and harvest their parts to fuel your war engine?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Yes.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
They're zombie generators. They each generate 80 red stone flux points of energy per tick.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
A tick is a tenth of a second, I think.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
So each zombie generator generates 80 and I have just a wall of them and they all run on this nutrient distillation

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
and then they funnel the energy into a big giant capacitor and then that charges everything.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Like my jet pack and stuff like that.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Your jet pack?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Oh yeah. Got to have a jet pack.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
Is there a first person or third person element to this where you're flying around?

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
It's a first person experience.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
So you're on a jet pack flying around through your sky cloud zombie killing?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Yep. Alone.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Is there any companionship? Is there anybody out there?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Just you out there with the zombies.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Just the comforting screams of their...

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
I usually put it on mute because it's a little disturbing.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
I keep my bedroom far away from where you can hear their cries of anguish and confusion.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
I'm sure they're very confused. They're like, hmm, brains, what am I brains?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah, it's pretty great. What am I doing?

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
I'm not saying this to be glib or smart assy. What is the payoff?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
What's the serotonin?

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
It's never going to end if that's what you were asking.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
My wife is always asking. It's never going to end.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
She's like, did you win yet? No, I did not win yet.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
What's the visceral experience of that?

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
Just getting fatter and...

04:46.000 --> 04:55.000
It's a world where every decision you make can result, if you choose it to, in perfect order.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
It's a perfect organization. Listen to that.

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
I took the zombies and I turned them into electricity and their pants get turned into gold.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
There's a place for everything and you just sort things and build them and you can create anything.

05:12.000 --> 05:21.000
It's like digital Legos. I need that in my life because nobody has that in real life.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Because the rest of life is too disordered.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
There's no result. If you could go out in the street and the lady could go, help, help, my wallet.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
There's a guy stealing her wallet and you're like, he's kind of smaller than me.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I'm going to do the right thing here.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
Then you go up and go, hey, get your damn hands off her and the guy just stabs you.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
And the woman's like, we tricked you.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
We're like a pair of people that do this.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Take his blood, take his blood. Let's get out of here.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Turn his pants into gold.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
In real life, you could be the zombie that's generated by an autospawner.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Our friend Annie from South by Southwest is here tonight.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
You think in her Minecraft games she would say, give me spinal stenosis?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Are you here, Annie?

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Okay, there you are.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Hello, Annie.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
People didn't like my offhanded glib use of you as an analogy.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, Annie's here. She can confirm now.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
I was glad to hear you were going to be here.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Did you just schedule an LA trip by coincidence or did you?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
I live here.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Oh, you live here? What were you doing in South by Southwest?

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
I was there to go to the community stuff.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Oh.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Do you want to come up here? Is it easy enough?

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Can we move that table so that she needs her walking?

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Oh, really? Okay, you can do it.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Let's welcome Annie over to wherever she is.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Hello, Annie.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Resplendent and pink sweater and pink bow.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Thank you.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
Okay, so we met you at South by Southwest, which was very loud and I didn't listen to the broadcast.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
I don't know if it was like too loud for the listeners or anything.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Oh, man.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I couldn't tell.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Because last time we were there, it was the same thing.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
But then I listened to it and I was like, well, it's not so bad.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Good thing we didn't spend the whole podcast like going, hey, what's with these people talking?

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
Because when I listened to it, I was like, ah, you can't really, you know, you can hear like a background sound effect.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
It's like we're doing a show to Fudruckers or something.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
But this time it was just unavoidable.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Like everyone that came up had to address it.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
We went over to the bar a thousand times and said, keep it down.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Didn't we send you over there at some point?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
My friend Jessica went and we were like cheering her on.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
And Erin went over.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Erin was the best because she would go over and be like, hi, what's your name?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
What are you talking about?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Shut the fuck up.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
So it was perfect.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
I don't know.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah, they got to figure.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
We got to ask more questions before we go back to South by.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
I thought this time the place would be sealed up because of Yahoo and stuff.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Let's ask for a theater next time.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Well, the open bar was the problem because everybody was standing around the bar and everybody wanted drinks.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
And they were talking to people at the bar because obviously you can't really hear what's going on at the show.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
But also those people at the bar, they were not at the Harmontown.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
No, a lot of them were just, you know.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah, they were just hanging out, like talking about like e-wallets and stuff.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
So we met you there.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And I don't know how much they could hear.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
But we asked you about your walker and then found out you have this tragic spinal stenosis.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
You were walking down the hall one day.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Down.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Just fell down and found out you're not going to be able to walk over again.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
It's going to get kind of worse as it goes.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
And then it came up that you're a big Annie Edison fan and that your name is Annie with one N.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
And that you have a blog where you talk about what Annie wears.

09:07.000 --> 09:15.000
And that you were bummed out about the move from skirts to pants, which a move I made to be a decent human being.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
I understood your logic behind all of it.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
You were just wrong.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
So it's fine.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
What was your guilt about that, Danny?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
You felt like you were being exploitative?

09:28.000 --> 09:36.000
Yeah, I'm looking at, you know, that character outfits differently.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
I'm not going like, oh, that old innocent schoolgirl thing.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
I'm a pig.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
And also, the character is growing and changing, so I thought, well, is she just in this stasis?

09:49.000 --> 09:57.000
Does she just have 11,000 short skirts and pairs of tights and cardigan sweaters in this closet?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
You should literally see my closet.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
It's like half cardigans, half dresses.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
So we put you in charge of wardrobe for the finale episode.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
There's a couple of scenes where she's dressed in accordance with your wishes.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
We actually connected you with our wardrobe supervisor.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
It's true.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
She still has not responded to me.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I'm not like mad.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
I'm not like trying to be like, hey, I'm very upset at all of this.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I asked a bunch of questions, and I think it was a little too much.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
I was literally three tweets with the questions, like this and this and this and that.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I think it was overwhelming.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And also, you're associated with me.

10:34.000 --> 10:43.000
The people that work underneath me are not big fans of, last night was the rap party for season six,

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
and it's always a tradition where I come up with a new way to promise that I'll figure out how to run a show.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
All the new people are like, yeah, good speech, man.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
And all the Rhonda the prop master for six years is over in the corner.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
If she smoked, she'd just have a cigarette dangling like, yeah, it's always going to be different.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
He's really learning.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Wait, so you already shot the Annie last episode then?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Somebody tweeted me a picture actually of it.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
I don't know how they managed to find this, but I guess there was somebody released a picture of everybody on set,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
and then somebody tweeted it to me and was like, hey, this is your outfit.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Is it all right?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Did we get it?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yeah, no.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I mean, well, it's not really a purple sweater.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I would definitely not call that purple.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Right.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
Literally what happened, I wish this was a more glorious story,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
but literally what happened was they sent me pictures of two outfits,

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
literally in the combinations that they were in on the show.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
So all the items had previously been worn, and it was only two outfits.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
So what I said was, can we swap that sweater for this dress,

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
because at least then it's a new combination of things she's already worn.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
That was my amazing costume designing.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
You were as, yeah.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Welcome to Hollywood, Annie.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
It's great to be here, Chef.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
I did have a little bit of a shithead shit-fit tantrum.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
I remember on the way to a meeting, because I was looking at these emails,

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
and I was going like, wait, there was a picture of a black sweater,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
and I was like, the only thing I remember is a purple sweater.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
That's all I know.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
How is that the one thing that's different?

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
And then they said that you were in contact with them, so after a point,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I was like, okay, as long as I look like a good person.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Spencer.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
That was my goal here.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
This is the real, yeah.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
No, Spencer got in contact with me, actually,

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
and I also talked to Kevin and somebody else, and things worked out.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
What are you holding there?

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
I'm holding a fan, because I'm afraid at any moment I'm going to heat up and be needing this.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
It's a little worm in here. You know why?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Very popular podcast.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
It's like the zombie generators.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
You could power a marble base with this room, all these brains and flesh.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
What does a marble base afford you?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I don't know, it just looks pretty. It's white.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Okay.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Everything down on the earth.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
What is your home base? Are you building a villa?

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
Like a home, like a fortress of solitude? What do you have there?

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
It's like a big computer kind of that takes in or takes in everything.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Is there an architectural aesthetic to it?

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Is it a white cube with multiple levels?

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
It's not about aesthetics, it's about function.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
What about the aesthetic of function?

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
When you look at it, you're like, this guy's functioning,

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
and he doesn't give a shit about anything, it's a power.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
Ancient Rome functioned, but they still had...

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
I mean, shizzle a couple of columns when I'm finished with everything being working.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
I could take a shizzle and I could make some things.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
You can? Can you make it look artistic? You can.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah, you like it now.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
I have no idea what we're talking about.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
But I do like the idea that one day you would graduate from function.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
When you got everything you wanted, when you achieved the heights of whatever you wanted,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
you would start becoming like an artistic...

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
I would save that for last, yeah.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
I would be like, okay, now I care if there's a pot in the corner with a plant in it.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
But up until the moment when you're a god, why would you care?

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
If I were a third-person Minecrafter walking up,

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
I ran afoul of your kingdom and I saw out in the distance a giant building,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
which is where you dwell.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I would just see a big cube.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
You would see, first of all, you would go, oh my god, what happened?

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
Because there's just these giant rectangular holes in the earth.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
I built an ender quarry and I just put it on a diamond upgrade

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
and it just goes...

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
And I just scoop up the earth down to bedrock so there's just lava.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
So far, that's ancient Rome.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
As you get to Rome, there's quarries and mines and chain gangs and bad things happening.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
Yeah, you'd be like, oh my god, what horrible monster did all this?

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
And then you'd look up on the sky and he'd go, is that the sun?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
No, it's my home.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Are you living in the sky?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Yes, I live in the sky.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
You live in a marbled cube in the sky?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Yes, I do.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
Okay, that's... I like that. That's good.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Do you play Minecraft, Annie?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
No, I do not.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
You play video games?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
I do play video games. I do. I'm actually really addicted.

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
I don't know if anybody knows this really old game that was on Linux called Chips Challenge.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Yeah, there was a Microsoft version in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack in the 90s.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
Anyway, I just discovered that some amazing humans with way too much time in their hands

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
have put all these level packs in and you can actually play it on the iPhone.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
So that's actually what I waste all my time on is playing this fake version of Chips Challenge

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
because it's like my childhood on my phone.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Is it like an ASCII game?

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
No, it's just like when the graphics are pretty shitty, it's two-dimensional

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
and you have to collect chips in the original game and then knock off its coins

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
but it's all puzzles, so you have to push the block into the water

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
to make sure that the creature doesn't come get you and yada-yada-yada.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
It's starting to sound like Minecraft, I like it.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Yeah, it's definitely like a precursor except this is all puzzle-based.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
So it's like everything is like you have to get to the end and how are you going to do that.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
And some of these puzzles are extremely tricky.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I mean, they're just ridiculous.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Do you ever play Myst?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Oh god, I loved it.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
You can get all of those too for the iPhone now.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Myst, Riven, and the seventh guest.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
They're like, yeah, buy them now, they are amazing.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
And it's like the perfect graphics for a third iPhone.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
They are a little dated, but still.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
But yeah, you can totally get them all.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Sorry, my wife is texting me.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Oh, we thought you were downloading games now.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
How do you know she was texting you from your pocket?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Did she have a certain kind of vibrate?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
No, well...

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
You pulled your phone out and said my wife was texting me before?

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Well, I didn't know, I brought it out, anybody could have been texting me, but then I saw that it was her.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
She texted me, Minecraft joke.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
Question, why did the sailor bring iron and gold into his boat?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Answer, he needed oars.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
Oh, that's good.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
I don't like the direction the show is taking.

17:31.000 --> 17:39.000
It really has become our generation's Prairie Home companion, including the boredom.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
It's just me just...

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
Sarah got her brand new hat.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
A blueberry pie.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Went to church.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
If you're wondering, why would anyone watch this?

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Which is what Dino asked.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
Right now, Dan, as of two days ago, the community is done.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Yeah, yeah, I've rapped on community, I'm done, I'm just editing now.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
I was there yesterday at CBS Radford, where you shoot who's Linus anyway.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
It's literally the soundstage directly above where they shoot community.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
So in the hallway where our dressing rooms are, it goes Ryan Stiles, Jeff Winger.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
It's not the actor's names, it's the character names.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
Is the character name Ryan Stiles coming up?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Or is there a character named Ryan Stiles coming up?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Well, no, he's a real person.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Well, I knew that.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
But that's why I was thinking it would be a really interesting reference to make.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
A character named Ryan Stiles.

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
But sadly, on all the doors for all the community characters, it said vacant, clean room.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
And I've been there several weeks when it said occupied.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Don't come in here, this is Annie's room, this is Jeff's room, this is Abed's room.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
And now, fucking do as you like.

18:51.000 --> 18:59.000
And Danny Pudi's like, okay, you can come in, clean it up, and there's just like blood everywhere.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Six dead hitchhikers.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
Tons of weird tic-tac-toe gamers played in his own poop.

19:07.000 --> 19:15.000
The Harvey Keitel character that works at Yahoo comes in and looks it over.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
And they nods to the cleaning crew, cover it up.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Make it disappear.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
What were the numbers last night?

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
$15 million, sir.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Make it so it didn't happen.

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
By the way, everybody in the world watches community, now we know,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
now that we're not being measured by Nielsen.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Is that true?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Yeah.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Like, I probably should have made the season better.

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
But it could have been a real double triumph for me to be at my peak,

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
as our viewership was, and our support from the other side.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Well, you're finding out that because Nielsen is so flawed,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
that more people are watching than you thought?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah, here's a fundamental way it's flawed.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
Guess who wants to fill out a diary of what they watched and sell it to Colgate?

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Like Jay Leno's audience does.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
That is a dying species of television viewer.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
And then there's this sought after demo called the, what's her?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
What's her?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
What are these college kids?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Whatever you call them.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
Millennials, upscales, roamers, sand people.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I don't know what they're.

20:26.000 --> 20:37.000
Banffas, nerf herders, lobos, tranks.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
But they don't watch TV yet, TV.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
They certainly, if they do, they're not watching it on a Nielsen box TV.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Oh, surprise, surprise.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Yahoo knows how to count the clicks.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Guess what?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Holy shit.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Jesus Christ.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Like, you always knew.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
How many people?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I can't say.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Why not?

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
Well, because it's Yahoo's business.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Like, I don't remember.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
It's their business, like, you know, like, that's their, I don't know.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
They're not necessarily going to, like, publish, you know, like, that was Nielsen's, like, business

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
was, we're this contractor and everyone give us money and then we'll announce your ratings

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
and we'll be, like, this referee.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
That was their business.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Netflix is not doing that.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
They're a private, you know, thing and they go, how many people are watching House of Cards?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Fuck you.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Do you think House of Cards is a good show?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Do you feel like everyone's watching it?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Yes or no?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Like, stick it.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
You know, there's no commercial.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
So with Yahoo, though, they have to tell advertisers, obviously, so they have data and they're just,

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
I'm not really asking and they're not telling, but they're, you know, lips were loose at the

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
drunken rat party.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
Enough for me to go, holy shit, that's what I always would have guessed.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Times two or three.

21:50.000 --> 21:58.000
I always knew there was, like, way more people watching this shit than whatever that.9 represented.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
Are you saying that NBC and Sony didn't know that or didn't care?

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
I think that the dirty little, I think that the last 10 years it's been a dirty little

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
secret that the Nielsen's has had a totally effective tabulation of viewership.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
Over time, we've gotten caught in this cycle where the whole point of the Nielsen system is advertising.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
So if they're not watching commercials, who cares if they're watching?

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
But the creatives, all the creatives want is for numbers of people to watch their show.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
That's how you measure their success.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
And so now we're in this weird, you know, flux period where it's like, okay, live plus seven day,

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
live plus 30 day.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
Yahoo doesn't even fucking, like, they're like, live plus 30 day.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Who gives a shit?

22:34.000 --> 22:40.000
Like, Yahoo knows more information than the CIA about, like, viewership.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
They're on the internet.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
They know, they just have, like, clouds and bell curves and things.

22:47.000 --> 22:55.000
Like, they're like, here's the amount of people that are emotionally moved to purchase things

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
by looking at one of Alison Brie's feet, you know, like, they don't, like,

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
they're not worried about views and, like, the week of and the night of and the month of.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
What do you think people purchase when they look at one of her feet?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
It's probably like a boot or something.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
I don't know.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
I don't know.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Look at that foot.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
I need a boot.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
I was just using the classic example.

23:19.000 --> 23:26.000
Kumail tweeted at one point, he said, his goal is to become so successful that one of the Google auto fill ins

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
is Kumail Nanjiani feet.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
It's like a typical thing for female celebrities.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
How you doing?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Are you bursting into flame or anything?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
All right.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
We got some things to talk about.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
So, yeah, I'm successful.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
So, will there be a season seven or is that it?

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Is community done?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
I don't know, man.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
What do you want?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Are you allowed to say?

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
I mean, I got to talk to my therapist about this.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I really don't know.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Dan, pretend I'm your therapist right now.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Pretend no one's listening.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Dan, put your phone down.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
I want to put your phone down.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
I want to play Minecraft.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
No, you don't.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Dan, I know you want to play Minecraft.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
And I know that if you had your way, you would only play Minecraft.

24:07.000 --> 24:15.000
But let's say there was a clamor and a great gnashing of teeth and wailing for another season of community by anybody,

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
either by Yahoo or by the fans or whatever.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
Would you say yes under certain circumstances?

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
I can't tell you right now because I'm just coming off of it.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Yeah, because you have bubble throat?

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
No, I have liquid mouth.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
I can't say.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
That's a perfectly normal thing.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I drank.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Dan, answer a question right now.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
I can't talk to her now because I swallowed a little bit of liquid in my mouth.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Or an ice cube.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
It's normal.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
It's not to be mocked.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
Dan, as your therapist, I think you're kind of evading the question right now.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
Under certain circumstances.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
There's so many variables.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Can you imagine a circumstance where you would say yes to doing this?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Yes, of course.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
I can imagine a circumstance where Hitler and I would hang out.

25:10.000 --> 25:17.000
It involves him hating Jews less and coming back to life and maybe being on a timeline

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
where he didn't kill a bunch of people and having a full mustache.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
There's a certain point where he's not Hitler anymore.

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
He's just Sam Elliott.

25:30.000 --> 25:37.000
And Jeff, how would it go if Sam Elliott was in charge of the Third Reich?

25:37.000 --> 25:48.000
You know the Jews are a bunch of assholes.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
The Jews abide.

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
The Jews abide.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
Yeah, so very popular television show.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Very popular.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Do you think it's going to come back?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
It doesn't.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
Okay, look, in no necessary order, let me throw some fucking variables at you.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
Does Alison Brie want to do?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
I don't know if the answer to any question you're about to ask.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
What does her left foot want to do?

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
The actor contracts her up.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
That is a big deal.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Okay, so let's say ratings are good.

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
Yahoo goes, hey, Dan, you want to try to marshal the troops and bring it back?

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
Do you say fuck that shit, we're done?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Or do you say let's see what the actors think?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Well, I would say let's see what the actors think.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
There's my answer.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Let's start from there.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
But a million things have to be different.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
I have to get my head out of my ass and learn how to run a show.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
You're never going to learn how to run a show.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
You've proven that this is the way that you run a show, right?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
You run the show the way that you run shows.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
But then nobody good will work for me.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
We had such a great crew this year.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
Our new DP buzz is so good.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I would work for you, Dan.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
This is your first year, though.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
See, then I'd have that energy and I wouldn't hate you.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
Did you say that you pissed off Ronda the proper lady or she's on your team?

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
It's always hard.

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
It's hard to work for me because the scripts come in last minute.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
And so if you're the person that makes the pants,

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
then you're like, I can't make good pants now because I just saw that this person's wearing pants.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
If I had known they were wearing pants a week ago, I could have made the best pants ever.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I like working the way that I work,

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
but I'm not bringing out the best in the people that work for me.

27:42.000 --> 27:48.000
They don't get a chance to look at a script and like, hmm, pants, huh?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I've got an idea.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
They just have to be like, here's some pants.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
You know that's called the wardrobe department, right?

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
Yeah, the pants people.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
They really are the people at the wrap party at the end of the year that are always like,

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
they have like that serious drama about them.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
For all the hell I put everyone through, it's always the wardrobe people that are like,

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
You challenge me.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
And I like the results.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
And I just want to go, come on, you make pants.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Take it easy.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
It's just pants.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
Worst case scenario, there's a bunch of naked, beautiful people on TV.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
Everyone wants that anyway.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
And they also come with their own clothes.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
But they couldn't pull off a purple fucking cardigan?

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
Well, it's not rag on them too much. There's only so many wardrobe people in the city, you know?

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
But yeah, our production designer, our prop master, our wardrobe supervisor,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
they've been, they're old veterans of the Harmon effect.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
And they're some great ladies. They're real heroes.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
I forgot my shoes last night, right before getting dressed for Who's Line,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I was taping the Who's Lines anyway.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
And getting dressed, I look in my bag, I forgot my shoes at home.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
And I go to the wardrobe, people's like, I got no shoes.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
And they ran to Marshall's and bought me some shoes that were a good size too small.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
And so I sent a PA to my place and he got stuck in traffic.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
So for the first two hours of a four hour taping, really small shoes.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
And then I kept playing Jar Jar Binks in a game.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
And Wayne Brady kept coming and cutting my throat because he hates Jar Jar Binks.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
That's a brave choice.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
To kill Jar Jar to play Jar Jar.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
To kill him, to be anti Jar Jar at an improv scene.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
But I broke a cufflink, so I had small shoes and one cufflink on it.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
It was a rough night for me.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Fists with your toes.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
Fists with your toes?

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
So Dan, I have to say this.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
There's you when you're working and you're in your manic, like, shit to get done mode.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
And then there's you when you're not working and you're seated the entire show.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
This is the first time you've been seated this long.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
Wait, are you sitting because you're trying to be sensitive to me?

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
No, I actually love sitting.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
It doesn't matter if the guest is able to run laps around the stage.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
You thought that would make me feel comfortable.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I'm one of you. I'm sitting.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I can sit.

30:36.000 --> 30:42.000
I had a girlfriend once who I swear to God.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
Suspender disbelief, everybody.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
She told me about a show she was in.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
She used to perform for these.

30:51.000 --> 30:59.000
There was this guy that had somehow stumbled into the kind of like goldmine of writing special shows for school kids.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
I think I've maybe talked about this in the podcast before, but like she was in a couple of his shows.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
So like he would write these like educational shows and there would be like musicals.

31:07.000 --> 31:15.000
And one of them that he wrote was for it was like to now this is where the language gets difficult because what is the point is to raise awareness.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
Is it to comfort? Is it to benefit?

31:18.000 --> 31:32.000
But it just has that he just had that specialness vibe on it because there was like this show he wrote that was about a kid in a wheelchair who goes to a magical land where everyone is a car.

31:32.000 --> 31:48.000
And the insinuation is like, I had so many questions, I was like, so is the idea, does the kid come back and be like, now I feel better?

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
She's like, no, he stays there, but he's happier because everyone else has wheels.

31:53.000 --> 31:59.000
And I'm like, that's not, does anyone check this guy's license to write for children?

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
But it's just like the kids in a wheelchair that he gets transported to heaven, to car world.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
And then the cars are like, they have these car songs.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
And she would shoot because she had a couple of them memorized and was like, everyone, he's doing the traffic jam.

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
Do the traffic jam.

32:17.000 --> 32:24.000
I was so intrigued by this guy and his career.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
Yeah, they just, we have wheels too.

32:28.000 --> 32:37.000
Anyways, that made me think of that, the idea that I would be sitting for your benefit to help you out like a magical car.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
Thank you, I was getting really jealous.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
Are we finding out that you brought Annie up just so you could sit down?

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
I often bring guest ups just so I could sit down because when the guests come up, I can't stand there.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
So yes, I often bring people up so I can sit down.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
Annie I brought up so that she could verify that I'm like the world's greatest showrunner.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Totally amazing.

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
I turned wardrobe department over to her and the result was an almost purple sweater.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
But I really almost got it done people.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
We almost got it done.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
It's just the headlines, you know, tomorrow.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
TMZ, Dan helps Annie.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
All right.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Are we going to get more sit down rapper?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I thought that was the funniest thing ever.

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
Lazy sit down rapper.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
I loved the smattering of applause I got were videos.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Why would you even bring that up?

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
I wanted to sus three something.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
I blocked Adam Goldberg on Twitter.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
And I can't really remember why.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
I just know that I did.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
I know why I did.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
I don't know if anybody, if it's possible, like you all have your phones in the audience.

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
Like if somebody can pull up like a timeline and look at like, because I was hashtag when I blocked somebody.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
I hashtag at Harmon Black 2015.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000
And so if you look, I don't know if you can find the what he said right before I did that.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
I'm so curious like what he did wrong.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
Was it because he said one thing or because it was too many things in a row?

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
No, it was like, it was like, it was just, I wasn't, I was in the wrong mood at the wrong time.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
Like I said something like, I was in a certain zone and like said something.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
And then he, he was like snarky and dot connected about it.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
And I was just like, fuck you, you fucking jackass.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
It's like, elaborate on why millennials are eight years old.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Oh, okay, yeah.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
It's just like, elaborate.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Oh, yeah.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
No, I, yeah, okay.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
So I was just in a pissy mood.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
I tweeted like an anti-millennial tweet.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
I said, remember when millennials were eight years old?

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
And we said, there are the future and now it's the future.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
And sure enough, we're all fucking eight years old.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
And then he, I don't know what he said.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
He said like, well, can you elaborate on that?

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
And I said, fuck you.

34:48.000 --> 34:54.000
I said, can you, can you, can you, can you live without a source of something to react to?

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Fuck you.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Harmon block.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
Wait, you have a hashtag for blocking people?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Sorry, what?

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Feel free to exist as a collection of reactions.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Oh, that's what I said to him.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Feel free to exist as a collection of reactions.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Wow.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Did you look that up right now?

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
Yeah, a medicine.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Oh, she looked it up.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
That's better.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Thank you.

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
I actually heard two different people called me to tell me about hashtag Harmon block 2015.

35:22.000 --> 35:30.000
They're like, Dan's blocking all these people and like literally trying to talk to me as though this is like gossip that is necessary in life.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
What are you taking right now, Dan?

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
What is this?

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
I got the ADD real bad.

35:33.000 --> 35:45.000
Steady as a rock.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
But he shoots at this hand.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Totally legal.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Got a prescription.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
Got the ADD real bad.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Does it get you high?

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
No.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
Actually, now I'm taking it, like remember when they warned you in the after school specials?

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
And after a while, you're taking it just to stay normal.

36:04.000 --> 36:10.000
Yeah, that's me because I was like, I was taking it to like stay awake and finish writing.

36:10.000 --> 36:19.000
And now as a, so now I wake up and like, because I have to taper off of it because it's like, otherwise my eyelids are like anvils.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Like it's, it's, it's, it's exactly what you would think.

36:22.000 --> 36:30.000
It's just a cartoonish inversion of what you get from the pill is like the year if you're coming off of it, it's like, holy shit.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
I'm really tired and super able to focus.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Wait, no.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
What do I take it for?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Focusing.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Super unable to focus.

36:38.000 --> 36:43.000
Something about focus.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
Annie, why one N?

36:46.000 --> 36:52.000
Well, I know, I know it's the question that's been on everybody's mind.

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
Actually, so it's a, it's short for my legal name.

36:57.000 --> 37:11.000
My name ends in ANI and at some point my friends and I thought it was clever for me to go by Annie and like for all those girls in the world whose name ends with ANI or ANY, you know, the Tiffany's, the Brittany's, the all the Stephanie.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Are you Stephanie?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
What are you?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Which, which one do you think I am?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
You're a Stephanie all the way.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
I am not a Stephanie.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
I am a Brittany.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I was going to guess a Brittany.

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
Yeah, but I, but I, so I always hated it and I was like, and I was also really into the Anne of Green Gables books.

37:25.000 --> 37:30.000
So I was like, well, Annie is kind of like Anne and I can be that kind of dork.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
So it was a dance.

37:33.000 --> 37:39.000
Why one N?

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
Just seem like a good place to stop, bro.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Yeah.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
All right.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
Well, I don't, I don't want you cooking up here and I got to, I'm going to, I'm going to bring out more people, I think.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
You want to give a hand for Annie and she need help getting down.

37:56.000 --> 38:05.000
All right.

38:05.000 --> 38:12.000
Now that she's gone, I can stand up again.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
You trying to mock Annie by standing up the horse in the shot?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
I don't know.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I just feel like this is what I've always done.

38:17.000 --> 38:24.000
When somebody comes up, I sit down and somebody's not up here, I stand up.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
I thought maybe it would give me a little boost of energy because God knows that medicine won't kick in until midnight.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
It takes a while to kick in.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Yeah.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Do you feel like kicking in?

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Not, not these days.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
I can't take that wrong because when I do it, it's like doing just a bag of Coke.

38:39.000 --> 38:45.000
I once took one at 7pm and I was wallpapering my apartment at 4am.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
I'm like, I got, I got shit to do.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
If you've never taken it and you, and you take that, that's the effect.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
Or if you don't take it for a really long time, then that's the, that is the effect.

38:57.000 --> 39:03.000
And I believe, I always assumed like that, if that, if it's having that effect on you, that means you don't have ADD.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Right.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Correct.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
But my friend has ADD, she takes it and her memory comes back.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Right.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
And she also goes to bed at 9pm or 10pm.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
Yeah. But as I started taking it more, like, like, because I got a real prescription.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
So I was like, okay, now I'm taking it.

39:18.000 --> 39:24.000
I did, it did even out and I did feel, as I said, like, I felt like there were positive effects that had nothing to do with staying awake.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
And, and, you know, Spencer's, Spencer's kind of convinced that I, that I have ADD.

39:29.000 --> 39:36.000
But, you know, that's just coming from his expertise as a dungeon master.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Should we bring him out and talk to him about my ADD?

39:38.000 --> 39:44.000
Spencer Crittenden.

39:44.000 --> 39:53.000
T. H. D.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
Hey guys, how's everybody doing?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
That's good.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
Spencer, what do you base your findings that Dan might have, ADHD or ADD?

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
It's funny, I just like, was missing my cue.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
I almost didn't come in because I was just explaining to DeMorge the answer to this very question.

40:14.000 --> 40:20.000
It's just, I mean, I don't know, it's, it's hard to explain, but my little brother is really ADD.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
And apparently I'm pretty ADD according to doctors and stuff.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
I don't know if anyone buys that, but.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
So I mean, I kind of know.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
My doctor was.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
Yeah.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
Just according to your doctor, we all have ADD.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
But I've seen.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
And glaucoma.

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
I've, I've seen.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Well, that's my doctor.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
Those are two totally different doctors on my side.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
But no, I work with the guy.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
I see his, his behavior, his antics at work.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
And it's just, it's very, to me, it just seems like a guy who has ADD.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
You know, no offense, Dan, you do great work, but just your mannerisms.

41:00.000 --> 41:07.000
They seem very deficit in terms of attention.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
What do you, what do you think?

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
What do you, what do you, what's your view of this season?

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
Like, like, like, do you have any, any, like, like people are probably curious.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Like what, what happened?

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
You know, you're sitting in, sitting there the whole time.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
What happened?

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Yeah.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
I don't know.

41:24.000 --> 41:30.000
You have any interesting insights about, about my work?

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
No, I mean, I don't know.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
It's, it's, I feel like people say it.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
It's just like, it's, it's all, it's all coming from you.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
I mean, obviously the writers do great work, but at the end of the day,

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
everything that is on screen has happened because of something in your brain.

41:46.000 --> 41:53.000
And as such, you know, it's, it's lame to give the other writers credit.

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
Spencer, what is your day-to-day task at the show?

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Okay.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
So I get in, usually Dan's still asleep or he's ambiguously in his office,

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
potentially asleep.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
So I don't want to bother him.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
What time of day are we talking?

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
You know, anywhere from 7 a.m. to 9 30.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
It depends on, you know, the night before.

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
And when I, when I determine that he is in fact awake, I try and ask him what he,

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
what he needs, what he needs, if he needs coffee or food or something.

42:22.000 --> 42:30.000
And then I, I go do that and I sit around and I basically repeat that routine for,

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
you know, the whole time.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
It's great.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
And other than that, I'm just sitting around and listening and observing.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Are you in the writer's room?

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Not so much this season.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
It was a, it was a hot office and there wasn't as many chairs.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
I would sit, my room is right outside the office and the walls were like paper thin

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
so I could hear everything at all times.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
And, yeah.

42:53.000 --> 42:59.000
Do you feel like, do you have ambitions to like write your own stuff and like maybe

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
have a show of your own?

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Yeah, definitely.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
I just don't think I am like good at anything.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
So I don't know how I could do it.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
Do you feel like your time listening through the walls like community might have prepared

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
you in some way?

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
Have you learned stuff?

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
Certainly.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
I think knowing how a writer's room works is a skill.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
I don't know if it's something that they're going to like look at and be like, oh, we

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
got to get this guy.

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
But I think that it's certainly something that does actually help because you have an expectation

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
and you kind of understand the packing order and just the workflow and how things go.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
So, I mean, I think it's valuable for that reason.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
Also, you know, you learn about writing.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Are you writing your own stuff?

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
No.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
I've written a couple things but I got off the wagon.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Are you one of those types?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
I'm not.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
I'm one of those writers and the reason why I'm not a stand up or a writer is because

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I don't think of comedy in terms of jokes.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
Like stand up friends of mine, they get up and they write jokes and they want to get

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
up and do material and writers wake up in the morning and go, I have to make a show about

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
a guy that does this thing or a girl that does this thing.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I don't think in terms of ideas like that.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Are you one of those people?

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Do you think of premises?

44:09.000 --> 44:15.000
I think of ideas in terms of like traps and monsters usually.

44:15.000 --> 44:22.000
So, it's kind of, it takes some creative work to turn that into like a script or a joke.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Are you a story kind of guy?

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
I mean, obviously, we know that you're good at like character and character development

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
and creation and certainly trap development.

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
I guess you'd say, I guess you'd say I'm more of a world builder in all honesty,

44:36.000 --> 44:41.000
like I'll think about things and then it's like, oh yeah, and the pizza story goes at,

44:41.000 --> 44:46.000
it has this guy and he has a mom that he's paying for cancer or something.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
What does he pay for cancer?

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Other people get it for free.

44:52.000 --> 44:57.000
No, but so just, you know, world building.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
It's really throwing your money away.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
It's paying for kids.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
But so that's usually how my mind goes.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
I could see you like writing a show because you're very gifted,

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
but I could also see you having like, you know, there's these myth buster guys.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I like that show.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
I watch myth busters, but I would watch a show where Spencer like is busting traps or I don't know.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Busting traps?

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Just trying to thwart his ventures.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Trap sensors.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
It would be interesting to have a show just like kind of a,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I don't know how you do it without hurting people,

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
but like the idea of like just traps, like people traps,

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
like I don't know, just doing weird shit to people.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
The new challenge rooms.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I would say this, Dan, if you were going to make that show,

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
if you were the head of a network and you came to me,

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
the junior head of the network and said,

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
is there a way to do a show without hurting people or just traps?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
And people are trying to evade traps.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
And maybe some people get caught in traps.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
I would say, well, the first thing I know is we got to get Spencer Crittenden on this thing.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
They have these like things that you can go to,

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
you know, like those games we were talking about,

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
missed, you know, and they have those games on the iPad.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Escape the room.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
The room, yeah.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Like escape the room is the name of the genre.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
Something like that.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
Like they have live action, escape the room like events

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
that you can buy a ticket to and go to and you're like in a room

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
and there's like a guy chained up like a zombie

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
and the chain is getting gradually longer, I guess.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
Yeah.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
And then you have to like figure out like these kind of like esoteric puzzles and things.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
I don't think I would enjoy that.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
It's fun.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
It's fun.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Well, I'm trying.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
It's not fun.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
It's horrible.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Did you went and did one?

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
Can you come and talk to us about it?

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Wait, are you willing to come up here?

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
You don't have to.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
No.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Okay, come on up.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
I just want to hear it.

46:52.000 --> 47:03.000
He's got shiny pants and a shiny necklace.

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
Hello, what's your name?

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Jenny.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Jenny?

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
With a G.I.N. and Y?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Grab that mic next to you.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Hi.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Hello, Jenny.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
Does it bum you guys out when I switch mics like that back there?

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
No.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Okay.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
They're pros.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Sparkle pants.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Jenny?

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Okay.

47:25.000 --> 47:31.000
So you went to one of these live action puzzle game things.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
I did.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
And it was a horrible idea because I took mushrooms first.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
Oh boy.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
This is not the vendor's fault.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
But just to let like a tiny little bit of that.

47:43.000 --> 47:49.000
That's like, I have no idea if Wicked is a good player or not.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Make sure your eyeballs wiggle.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
It's teeth grinding leave.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Wonderful.

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
Okay, but continue.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
So there's this building in New York.

48:02.000 --> 48:08.000
I'm from New York, but you go in and it's a bunch of goofy actors.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
We're familiar with New York.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
What show did you see?

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
It was called...

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
Nice, Dan.

48:17.000 --> 48:26.000
Dan's doing the world's longest least merited camera take.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
It doesn't even make sense because we're in LA.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Yeah, I mean, way more so.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I mean, there's nothing but actors here.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
New York has a couple of people who are selling fish.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
What was the show called again?

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
It's called The Room.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
And it's just like a big building and you go through all the rooms.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
And are you with a group of people?

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Yeah, and you have to try to figure it out.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
As a group?

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Yeah.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
You're talking it out with each other?

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Yeah, it's just really...

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
There's a bunch of people that are pretending to give you a hard time, but...

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
Like there are paid performers that are like,

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
Look, it's not even my idea to be here.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
Yeah, yeah.

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
So it's people like me that have to deal with this.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
I'm not going to say what race that guy is.

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
But he's wearing a flannel shirt with a thermal shirt underneath it.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
And he's like salt of the earth.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
Like reminding you that you're privileged and like...

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
That's the first character I'd want to write for one of the six.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
You would probably come up with a better one then.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
I would.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Of course I would.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Yeah.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
I got excited about it.

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
Like Aaron told me about a thing where you pay...

49:37.000 --> 49:42.000
And then it's like a Halloween horror thing where you pay and then you go...

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
And it's like a tour...

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
God, what am I doing?

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
I don't know how to talk.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
I thought Adderall was supposed to help you focus.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
I took that thing minutes ago.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
It's for Minecrafting all night.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
It'll kick in halfway through an episode of Empire.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
Why not be a professional and take this four hours before the show?

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
I forgot.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
Because I'm not focused on anything.

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
I forgot my Alzheimer's medication.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
You go to a thing and you're...

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
It's like a haunted house.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
It's like a zombie apocalypse.

50:25.000 --> 50:30.000
But you're led through this thing by these SWAT team guys who are survivors.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
They go, come on, get through the door.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Come on, it's closing.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
And you're in a bomb shelter kind of situation.

50:36.000 --> 50:41.000
And you run from point to point with these guys that have guns and stuff.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
But they're performers, but then there's zombies attacking you.

50:44.000 --> 50:49.000
That is the only thing I've ever heard of that sounded kind of fun that I would enjoy doing.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Except for running.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
Just the idea that there's this kind of...

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
If you combine that with a murder mystery thing where you're like,

50:57.000 --> 51:03.000
oh, I'm Professor Johnson and I need to...

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
More the lawn.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
If there was a little bit of role playing to it, maybe,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
and you kind of did it with your friends.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
So you give them $1,000 and you take 80 of your friends.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
You go in and there's these SWAT team guys that go, come on.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
Okay, so you get dropped off in a shuttle.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Are we creating a new show right now?

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
Yeah, and I don't know how much of this that they do,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
but when I heard the idea, I got excited about it.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
So I pictured you get in a shuttle and then you get dropped off of a little beach or something.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
And then there's like a pretenzies downbeat thing that's going on.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
It's like, happy birthday, Jeff, when you're on a beach.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
And you're like, happy birthday, Jeff.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
And then there's a zombie attack that's just sort of staged.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
There's a guy who's in your party that is like a red shirt in Star Trek.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
He's on the bus with you.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
And it's like, y'all know me. I'm Gail.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
And everyone's like, Gail, you fuckface.

52:00.000 --> 52:05.000
And then Gail wanders off and he gets attacked horribly by a zombie.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
And then we go, oh, shit.

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
And cops or soldiers come up and go, come on, come on, come on, come on.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
And then you take you to a shelter.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
And then, I don't know.

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
Then you have to vote on who to feed to the zombies or something.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
This is very similar to my experience.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Yeah.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
Okay, so yeah, I forgot.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Were you hallucinating genetically high?

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
No, no, no, just like fun high.

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
So you get to this room and then they go like, oh, you got to solve a puzzle.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
Yeah, and there's like a door in the corner and they expect you to find them.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Are the easy puzzles a hard puzzle?

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
Yeah, is it like the room challenge where it's like, uh-oh, there's a doormat.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
There's like a key taped to the bottom of a drawer.

52:44.000 --> 52:48.000
Yeah, so it actually is just physical kind of perceptiveness.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Yeah.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
Interesting.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
It's a real live version of a point and click thing

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
where you just like run your cursor over everything.

52:57.000 --> 53:02.000
Just like run, drag your hand across the room until a shingle turns around.

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
So I was like the smartest person in my group.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
Then I'm like, there's a box on the top of the dresser that has a key in it.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
And it's got like, we have to reset the clock.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
And then the clock makes another key come out.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Stupid.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Exactly.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
All right, Ginny, is Ginny?

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Ginny, yeah.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Sparklepants, Ginny.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
Sparklepants.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
High on mushrooms all the time.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
Has a major drug problem.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
Sparklepants.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Needs an intervention.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
Oh, sorry.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Ginny.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
I went to a show with a dean I told me to go to in New York called Sleep No More.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
Have you guys been to that?

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
Yeah.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
That's Macbeth.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
You go into a big hotel and it's a 20s jazz club and you walk in

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
and you get split up from your people and you put a mask on.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
And you walk through rooms and you're encouraged to go snoop through drawers

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
and look around and read stuff.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
And for the first 45 minutes, nothing was going on.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
It was like, this sucks.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
And then you would hear some commotion.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
And you start snooping around and following stuff.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
And then you start watching Hamlet be played out.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
But also, it's just like, you're just in rooms and you watch a murder.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Then everyone gets naked and they're just dancing around.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
It's great.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Yeah.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
Everywhere you go, that happens.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
It's like a McDonald's.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
That's not going to happen to any of us.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
Well, not with that attitude.

54:26.000 --> 54:31.000
So Aaron is at home right now because the Nigel, the grief dog, the new dog,

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
he ate a pile of Harvey's hair.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
And so first of all, pause.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Why is there a pile of Harvey's hair?

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Because it's summertime.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
We're starting to give him a little haircut.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
So Aaron gave him a little haircut.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
So there's a pile of shaved hair from Harvey.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Dogs eat hair?

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
Grief dogs.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
So Nigel ate Harvey's hair.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
And then his poops have ropes coming out of him.

54:58.000 --> 55:04.000
And Aaron has to pull them.

55:04.000 --> 55:10.000
Like he's a British Christmas popper.

55:10.000 --> 55:15.000
But there's no, you don't get a whistle, you don't get anything.

55:15.000 --> 55:20.000
I had a dog one time that ate an insole of a shoe,

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
like a foam shoe liner insole.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
And it came out like a perfectly spiraled poop shape.

55:25.000 --> 55:30.000
It just went straight through this dog's body and came out as a shoe liner.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
It was amazing.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
I'm wearing it right now.

55:36.000 --> 55:41.000
I can't figure the dogs that are among us, like they're the descendants of the dogs

55:41.000 --> 55:47.000
that mutated the ability to just eat anything and not die, almost.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
Except Harvey had an incident with a fan's Rice Krispie treat tray.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
I told you guys about that.

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
So Nigel the Grief Dog is pooping hair ropes right now?

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Yeah.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
And Aaron has to physically pull them out of his butt

56:03.000 --> 56:08.000
because it hurts his little, took us to, hurt some to make the poops.

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
And he's in the middle of getting trained how to poop.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
So he's like, this is what I'm supposed to do.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
You care where I do this? It hurts.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
And we're like, yeah, don't do that in the wrong place.

56:20.000 --> 56:26.000
And he's like, it hurts. It's all the wrong place.

56:26.000 --> 56:31.000
I've never heard of a dog eating hair. That's a hungry dog.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
Well, you're not supposed to feed him for the first seven months.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Oh.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
Okay, now there's your problem. There's your problem.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
Although I did get my dog training book on eBay and there's a page missing.

56:43.000 --> 56:48.000
It's called Don't Feed Your Dog.

56:48.000 --> 56:54.000
The way the words break down, it was the equivalent of the six that turns into a nine.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I haven't fed my dog in seven months.

56:56.000 --> 57:06.000
Fart corner.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I'm all done with that fucking show.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
Are you happy?

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I don't even know. I don't even know.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Is it a weight off your shoulders?

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
Of course it's a weight. It's like the understatement of the year.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
You seem like you're just kind of neutrally buoyant right now.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
I have no idea who I am, what I'm doing.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
I have no idea what I like. I don't know who likes me.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
I don't know if Chris McKenna hates me or if he loves me. I have no idea.

57:32.000 --> 57:38.000
I'm not joking. I sense that because, and I'm not saying this to be corny,

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
but I feel like your identity is often what you're working on.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
That goes for lots of us. Everybody.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
When you're working on something, that is a huge part of who you are.

57:46.000 --> 57:52.000
And now that that show is over, do you feel like there's a suspension of identity?

57:52.000 --> 57:57.000
Yes. It's called workaholism, which sounds productive,

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
but it can also just be this.

58:01.000 --> 58:06.000
Just like a slob who only knows who he is by what he does.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
Does that make you want to throw yourself into Rick and Morty or whatever's next?

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Or does it make you want to just play Minecraft?

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
I'd like to play Minecraft for a little while.

58:15.000 --> 58:21.000
Which is me working digitally, so I know who I am by my marble cube.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
You don't ever picture yourself like, like, fuck it.

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
I'm going to go to Centro Pay and sit in a beach and just chill and have a nice...

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I'm going to go to Barcelona with Aaron.

58:31.000 --> 58:36.000
They invited us out for a film festival, television festival kind of thing.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
They're going to treat us real nice.

58:38.000 --> 58:43.000
It's kind of a working vacation because I'll do a lot of press in Spanish.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
I don't speak Spanish.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Catalan.

58:47.000 --> 58:54.000
Okay, I'll just say that.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
What is that?

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
That's a dialect they're speaking in Barcelona.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I can't call it Spanish.

59:00.000 --> 59:10.000
If you speak Spanish, they'll understand you, but they might speak back to you in Catalan.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
Dan, here's all you need to know about Barcelona.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Do you like ham?

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Yes.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
You're good to go.

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
You cannot be a fucking vegetarian in Barcelona because it's simply ham.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
They'll put a bit of ham on everything you get.

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
I talked to a motherfucker for ten minutes in Spanish about my paella.

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
I said, this is the vegetarian paella and it still had sausage and shrimp in it.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
I said, what the fuck is this?

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
He goes, ay, verduras.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
There's vegetables in it.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I'm like, ay, ay, fucking vegetables.

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
There's a shrimp on top of it, on top of the sausage.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
He's eating some of your vegetables.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
The shrimp is like, excuse me.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
They don't take it.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
If you like ham, you're fucking ready to rock there.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
All you have to do is go into a place and say, ham.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
I wonder if anyone really does like ham.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Doesn't it seem like this is a dumb meat?

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Who does or does not like ham?

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Well, just like anyone who's like a fan of ham.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
It seems like it's like there.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
You're going to go to Barcelona, Jackson, and the whole city is based on ham.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
You go into a restaurant and there's just fucking hams hanging in the window.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But that's different.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
They're an old world. They love survival.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
The Irish love potatoes because it could grow in Ireland.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
This is luxury. This is leisure meat.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I came to Barcelona for the ham.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I can't wait to eat ham.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Yeah, you do.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
It just seems dumb to me.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
That's what you fucking do.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
That's like licking tile grout or something.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I don't know.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
It just seems dumb.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
It's a fucking ham joint.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I can see somebody liking lamb, beef, chicken.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Any other meats?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Ham?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Well, there's hams the fourth one.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
And I just think it's like the early 90s Fox network of meats.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
It's just not a contender.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
They haven't gotten their Simpsons yet.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
It's just garbage.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Ham just seems like a dumb meat.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Salami?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
What is salami?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
It's the sausage.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
It's just spicy pork.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I don't know anything about meat.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I'm angry about it.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I don't understand what the hell any of this shit is.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
All these animals are dying.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Look at me.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I look like a pig.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Every day I was like, Spencer, go get me a fucking burger.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Somewhere there's this assembly line of these sad animals that have IQs higher than some

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
of the people I work with.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
California is out of water.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
We're out of fucking water here in California.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
If you're flying on a plane in the daytime, you're landing in California, look out the

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
window and look at all the reservoirs empty.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
There's no fucking water here.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Yet we have tons of water to grow alfalfa, which is what we feed cows.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
It takes a fucking ton of acres of alfalfa to make a couple pounds of meat.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
It's ridiculous.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It's completely insane.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And then they fart and the cows fart and that's an environmental thing.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
The cow farts.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Did you hear that?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
That's just a fucking bugbear man.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
It's a bogey.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
What?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
It's a mucka muck.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
It's a muscle mass.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
You're my muscle mass, man.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.000
But I hear tell that the beef is like a big, you know, deforestation.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
It's 9-eleven.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Nice.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
It's 9-eleven.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
It's 9-eleven.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Make a wish.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Make a wish.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
What are we doing now?

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Our new tradition is every week you forget.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
But have we settled on one?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I think for this week we make a one-act play about 9-eleven.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Okay.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Or no, we make a one-act play about whatever we were just talking about.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Well, we do a one-act play set against the backdrop of 9-eleven.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Okay.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
But it's about something else.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Okay.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
About jeans.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
About jeans.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
No, don't go there.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Okay.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
There's an urban legend about firefighters stealing jeans during 9-eleven.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
It's not true.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Stealing jeans?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Yeah.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
From where?

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yeah, from the concourse underneath 9-eleven.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
There was like, yeah, it's an urban legend.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
There's this guy that wrote a book about ground zero.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
What the fuck?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
There was this urban legend that developed where they found a fire truck filled with jeans

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
from the gap.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And it's the most ridiculous urban legend because it's like, can you imagine being a firefighter

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:26.000
during 9-eleven and you're like, boys, you're looking at this the wrong way.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
It's just so silly.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
For everything that we hold sacred, someone has to create some kind of thing.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It's just like our mind creates mythology.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000
So there was this notion, it's completely unverifiable that they unearthed in the rubble

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
a fire truck and it was filled with jeans.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And I can feel it's clear in the room, but in case it doesn't translate over electronic

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:02.000
fibers, we're laughing because 9-eleven's bad and people are good and firefighters are

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
great and we're not laughing at 9-eleven.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
But are firefighters great only because of their weird love of jeans?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I mean, it's funny.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
It just gets you like, in the Rick and Morty writers room, we were talking about this for

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
three hours about the firefighters stealing the jeans and we developed a whole movie about

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
a firefighter.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
What was the movie called?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Can we fade in?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Can we see some of that?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I know the slogan for the movie was one-size-fits-all.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I want to talk about it logistically because the poster, I also remember the poster I drew

01:04:48.000 --> 01:05:00.000
was the New York skyline with two legs of jeans that became, oh, oh, oh, and the title,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I remember the title.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
It became what?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
It became what?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I don't know exactly.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:16.000
The story is about a firefighter who survives 9-eleven with a bunch of jeans and he now goes

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000
around the country and he gives a pair of pants to each family of a victim of 9-eleven

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
and they magically all fit.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000
It's like a traveling pants thing in there.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:41.000
The title of the movie was, I've got to get this right, so, Redenimshin.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.000
We developed a whole movie, we did not work on Rick and Morty for half a day and we were

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
just crying, laughing.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Of course we're crying, laughing because that's why these things happen.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
How did the firefighter acquire all of these jeans?

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
How did he come across them?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
The idea is that there's a concourse underneath the World Trade Center that has all these

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:06.000
stores and stuff and they were looting before they really realized the gravity.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
It's not true.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
It's not a real story.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
It was printed in a book by a guy who did not verify the story.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
He just kept hearing it, but every person he heard it from was not a verifiable, you

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
know, it was just urban legend.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
So he printed urban legend, so it became like a real urban legend.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:32.000
It's like, you know, you Google like, or Yahoo, firefighter pants 9-eleven.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Nice catch.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Nice catch.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
It really is a good search engine.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
It's much more than searching.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
It's so much more than searching.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
You could, without even looking for it, you could find your horoscope.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
You don't even have to search for that.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I bet on Google you have to type, what's my horoscope?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Yahoo, it's there.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
And they have a whole section called Yahoo Answers.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000
You ever want to know anything from a 16-year-old who doesn't know anything?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
You could just go on there and go, hey, how much does a basketball cost?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And someone will go like, why are you asking?

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
They'll see a doctor.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
It's a great service.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Yahoo Answers is just a bunch of dingbats at a 250 million-way intersection.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Yahoo Answers, because some answers are bad.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Is there a slogan?

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Yeah, Redenimchin.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
So when the people get the pants and they magically fit.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Then they're like, OK, thank you.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
But fucked up what you did.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And he's like, I couldn't have, and they're like, we know.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
But still, you should have tried.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And he's like, OK.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Shouldn't that guy go, I gave away all the pants.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I did what I could.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Everyone got pants that was affected by this.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
They all fit.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And he goes back home to Long Island.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
There was a family.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
There was Staten Island, let's say.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And he goes back home with his wife and kids.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And he sits there and they knock on the door.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And there's an old...

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Oh, shit.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
That was my accident.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Or was it?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
There's a knock on the door.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And there's an old...

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I'm picturing the Asian guy from Gremlins,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
the guy that gives him the magway.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000
And he goes, you know that there's genes.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
There's a reason why they were hidden down there

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000
in that concourse beneath World Trade Center Tower 1.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Because those genes are cursed.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Oh, no.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
And then there's going to be...

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And then you pull back and there's towers being built

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000
everywhere where he gave pants away.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Yeah.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
And then that music plays.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
What did you...

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
What are you shaking your head for?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
What did you expect?

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I wanted you to launch into one of your famous fade-ins

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
on fucking, you know, like...

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
That's the end of the movie.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
No, it's the beginning of the second act.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
What?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
It's the beginning...

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
The first act, as 9-11 happens,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
and a firefighter gives away all the pants.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Yes.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
And at the end of the first act,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
a Chinese guy says, those pants cross 9-11.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
That's the crossing of the first threshold.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Are you Christopher Nolan?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Yes.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
The first threshold.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Oh, seems like a good movie.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
That seems like that was enough.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
However, no, no.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
You got yourself into a world of fucking...

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
This is way bigger than jeans.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
It's way bigger than 9-11.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
You've got three hours of McConaughey

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
and a bookshelf.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
No, you gave everybody cursed pants.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Oh, right, all right.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
These are cursed pants.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I've not seen the movie you're talking about.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
You gotta see this movie.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Oh, behind the book, guys.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Oh, there's me.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Oh, that's when I did that.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Oh.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I'm a little bolder now,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
because since I aired that,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
my grievance is about interstellar.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
A lot of people have come forward

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
and thanked me for my bravery.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
And said, thank you.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I can't say it.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
You know, I'm a PA.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Or a stunt coordinator.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
You know, someone has to fall off that bookcase.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Nolan runs this town.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Thank you.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Thank you for saying that the movie's a little silly.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Anyways, your movie...

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
My movie is that the movie starts

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
when the guy finds out that the pants he gave away,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
he thought he was doing a good deed.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
So at what point in your movie is the guy

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
going from town to town giving pants

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
and having these emotional conversations?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I would call that a road of trials.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
But for you, it's just like an ordinary world.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
No, no, no, let's make it the...

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
The meeting with the goddess is the Chinese guy saying...

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Finding the pants is the top of the circle.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
The bottom of the circle is like,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
finding out what the pants are actually about.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
When you say finding the pants,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
you mean looting them from 9-11.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Right.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
So it fades in on 9-11.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Yeah, a guy says,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
oh, shit, free pants, 9-11.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Fucking great.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Then his wife goes, honey, that's fucking...

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
You profited.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
We have a fire truck.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Fire truck full of jeans outside.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
So we identify with this character,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
so it fades in and 9-11's happening.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
And it catches you, like a certain battalion,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
and the guy goes like, go, go, go, go.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Up to floor 19, up to floor 19.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
And the guy's like, this is just a fire.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
It's going to be fine.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Or there's an accident, like the sign.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
If you really want to identify with a guy,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
like the sign has to turn upside down,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
so he goes to the wrong floor.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Sure.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
So then he's just surrounded with pants.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
There's jeans, and maybe someone else says,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
hey, you know, everybody clear out the building.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
It's like, it's just a fire.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Let's get everybody out of here.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
And he goes like, oh, there's fucking jeans in there.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Right.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Take these jeans.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And so he goes home and he's got a bunch of jeans.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
But he gets home, and he goes, I got to get these jeans out of here.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And then he realizes all of his friends are dead.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And he feels guilty about it.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
So he goes and gives all those jeans away.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I'm going to make my mission to travel to Earth.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
So it's like, 9-11's the cold open.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Right.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
And it's like, yeah.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
So he runs into it, and he's like, I think you need,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
like you'd have to do it in flashback,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
which is kind of cheating,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
but you have to establish that this guy,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
like you're Turk 182.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Like the idea that being a firefighter is like,

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
the city fucks you over.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Like the guy is like, his dad has dementia,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
or his brother, well, just rip off Turk 182

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
and say his brother got hurt really bad

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
being a firefighter, and they didn't give him compensation.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Right.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.000
So like, he's going to 9-11, like half predisposed.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
He's primed.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
He's like, this is my last day as a firefighter.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
And then they're like, they're like,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
mismanaging 9-11 somehow in a civic sense.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Go up a holding pattern, Roger that.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
You kind of look at the bureaucratic side of it.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
You're like disillusioned.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
You're like, it's a disaster.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And I know, I know the big picture of this.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
But from his perspective, it's like, this is ridiculous.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Like, what is my job?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
How do I know when I'm helping people or whatever?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And then he just goes through this door,

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
because he's like, I'm going to try.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And he gets yelled at.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
He's like, his boss goes like, Henderson, what are you doing?

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
He's like, I'm trying to save people, sir.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
He's like, I don't pay you to save people.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Go in that room and cool off.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Go in that room until you know what's important.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And he goes in the room and it's like a closed down gap.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
And he's like, and he looks up and it's like denim gold.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Yeah.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And the fluorescent lights are flickering

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
and it's just jeans everywhere.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Yeah.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And it's like the camera kind of pushes on him.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000
As you hear, like, black, red denim shirt.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And then it fades up and it's like his dementia,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
at old father is like being fed soup by his mom

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
when they're watching like all the coverage of the disaster

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
like a week later.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And his brother is like all burnt up in the corner going like,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
when I, good thing I didn't have to go to 9-11.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
And he's like, yeah, but you get fucked up too.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And they fucked you over.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And then he's like, how come you, how come you survived 9-11?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And he's like, I told you, they made me go in a room

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
and they're like, well, whatever.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
And then he's like, okay, I'm going to go downstairs

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
and think about stuff.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And he goes down to his bedroom and like his bed

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
is surrounded by all these jeans.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And he's watching on the TV.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
He's watching these funerals, like the 21 gun salutes

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
and the, and then he's like, he's just laying in his bed.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
He's like, fuck, the fuck have I done?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I'm a ghoul.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I'm a horrible ghoul.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
And so then like, okay, so this is like seven minutes

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
into the movie, the credits are still going underneath

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
as he like, dry and then he's like, cut to Montana.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Director of photography.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Peter Smokler.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Here's your paint.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Like I fucked up.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I was there.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I couldn't have done anything, but I did steal these pants

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
and it's fucked up.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
It doesn't make any sense.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
It's like, that's why, that's why,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
karmically why this shit happens to us as a country

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
is because of greed.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
So here's these pants back.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
And, and, and I hope they fit you.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
And, and, and she's like, I'll be right back.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I don't know if they will, but I'm like, they better.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Obviously.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
And then she, and then she could actually,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
they should look like they really won't.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
They should look way too small for us.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Well, thank you.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Like I was just like, great.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
You know what, I'm going to go try to put these on

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
and come out and bitch you out.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
So she goes in the bedroom and then it was like,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
this was just a clock ticking tick as he looks

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
at the photographs of the dead 911 people.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000
And the flag folded up.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Yeah. And the dogs like,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
and, and then she, and then he's like,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
he's like, I'm going to do, I'm just going to,

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
maybe add like a character that's always like,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
you should kill yourself.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Like, like, like, like the ghost of his brother

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
who died in 9-11.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
So he's, so that he always, there's always like a voice,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
his brother saying like, do it, do it,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
fucking kill yourself.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
You piece of shit.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
You should have fucking died.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
You should be dead.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And he's like, okay, you want me to do it?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
You want me to do it?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And he takes that corkscrew and he's like,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
got it under his, under his neck.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And, and, and, and, and then the woman says,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
yes, I do want you to do it.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And he, and he slowly turns and she's like,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I do want you to keep giving out these pants because,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
because they fit great.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I was about to ask you, do I look fat in these jeans?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
But I know what the answer is.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
The answer is no.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Right.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I look fantastic.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And he's like, oh, and she's like,

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
you're doing a good thing here.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I suggest keep doing it.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And then he goes, take me home country road.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And it's like a line going around the country

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
and there's just pants like, it's like, you know,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
you got to speed this up at a certain point.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
It's just like stacks of pants going down and like,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
like, like people accepting them, talking to them,

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
like cowboys and a pasture of cows.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
And they take the,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
there's a seaside and one kid has,

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
neither kid has jeans on.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
And they cussed the one kid and all of a sudden he,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
that kid has jeans on.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
What?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
What?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
What?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
What?

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
What?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
What?

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
What? You're doing camera tricks?

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Like, like, like, like it cuts.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Like a Beatles video?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I'm trying to make this fun.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
It's me.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
It's tasteless.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
It's terrible.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
What do you mean?

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Well, it's just like, it's not,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
you're making it seem like campy and like, like, like fun.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Like, like.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Okay.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I'll take it more seriously though.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I'm sorry.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
He's keep, he keeps giving pets.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
So I'm trying to, I'm trying to write your movie.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Okay.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Because, okay.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
So it's page, page 13.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
The truck, you look at the truck and there's like,

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
you see the stack of jeans getting slowly smaller.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
The last pair of jeans that he gives to somebody,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
and that last person should be somebody who,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
like somebody, somebody could have read it.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
It's the, it's the 14 year old black kid that becomes

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
like his sidekick because the pants don't fit

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
for some reason.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Because he lives in the Bronx and the last stop is like,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
he's like, he's like, hey kid,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
but the real reason is because the kid will find out

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
on page 60, he lied.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
He doesn't, he's not a family of a survivor.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
He just wanted pants.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Okay.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Okay.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I know, I know.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
It's fun, but it's going to be a,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
but his brother got shot by cops.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And he deserves the fucking pants

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
because everyone has 9-11 going on all the time.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It's only now after you say that,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
that I feel bad about my camera tricks and the seesaw.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Yeah.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Like, like, or try to win at a masquerade.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Making a movie.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Okay.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Hold still.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
They'll put the pants on.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I need some money.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Help.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Silly, but like silly.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
It's insane.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
So the kid, the kid tries the last pair of jeans.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
They don't fit.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And the guy says, what?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Our hero says.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
He says like, huh, maybe because it's the last pair.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And then the kid's like, yeah, I don't know.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
But they're like kind of baggy.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
And he's like, maybe I like these.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Maybe those jeans were in the fire truck already.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Maybe those are.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Maybe they're my pants.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
I don't know.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Yeah.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I don't know.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I don't know.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
The kid's kind of a hasty, like, might have to cut the kid.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Like, I don't know.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
The kid stays in the picture, dad.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
But he, so he's at home.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
It's page 16.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
He's eating pancakes.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Dementia dad died while he was gone.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000
The burnt brother is like, like, still burnt.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
And like, still like, why are you here?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
How did you survive 911?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
It's so fucked up.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
And, and then I'm just going with your.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
So there's a knock on the door.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
It's an old Chinese man says like those pants were under 911 for a reason.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
They're cursed.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
They caused 911.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
This is your idea now.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
No.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Okay.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Oh, well, okay.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Well, I their cursed was your idea.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Right.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I'm saying that there's a reason like, like you find out that he puts these pants on people.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
But that, uh, that comes at a, like that's just too good to be true.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
There's a reason why they fit everybody.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
He has to go get them all back.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
No.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I think all those people, like, like they, he's created an army of people with magic

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:58.000
genes on that they're worse than 911.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
So what happens?

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
You're the writer.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I wrote a whole movie about the guy and you weren't like, yeah, I thought your momentum would carry you through this.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Oh man.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
No.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
They become zombies.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Yeah.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
That's what I was thinking.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
It just seems like it's just a random.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
This is like mumblecore.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
So what they call it, mumblecore.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Yeah.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
It's like one of those dupless, dupless brothers.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Disappointed Dan.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I thought you would have been able to finish this off.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
The guy comes and says, those are pants.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Like we're crossing the first threshold.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Those pants, those pants are cursed.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
So then he goes like, okay, I should go get them back.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
And the Chinese guy goes, no, you can't.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Cause that would be back and forthy.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.000
So, so now all those people are going to, they're going to start fires.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Are they going to be Al-Qaeda?

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Let's say, okay, let's say, okay, forget the cursing.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Let's say that's.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Weddings start hitting people's houses?

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Yeah.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
What does?

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Oh, planes.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Yeah.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Well, what if the gene-wearing people like are, are, they're driven now to return to the

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
concourse?

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And if they all do something horrible happens.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000
It's really more of a thinker.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000
What about, okay, Dan, Dan, forget about the Chinese guy at the door.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Like what's the end of your movie?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
The guy gives the pants back and what happens?

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Well, the whole movie is, yeah, he gives, well, like in my movie.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
That's the end of the movie?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
He gives the pants back?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
The end?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Everybody gives a pair of pants?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
The threshold is he sets out on the road to go give the pants back.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:42.000
So it's a whole quadrant of the circle is 9-11, which is what people want out of this.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
From the poster.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
They're like buying tickets to see this.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Because the, the towers are both legs of pants.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
The road trials.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Sorry.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Tom Kaufman from Rick and Morty, he sent me a picture of the thing and I have, I have

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
the log line and the, the title.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
It's really close.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Um, he put the tagline is heroes coming all sizes.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Heroes coming all sizes.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Which is also Willow.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Yeah.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I stole it from Willow, but.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000
And then, uh, it's, it's Redenham shin, uh, colon pants on fire.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Because he's a liar.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Yeah.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Yeah.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
All right.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Yeah.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
The, the pastor has to be cursed.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
That's just good enough alone.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
So, so the, the, it's a, it's a, it's not a movie.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
It's not, it's not like an event film.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
It's like a tearjerker and an Oscar winner.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Like he, he goes on a journey of self discovery.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Like he figures out who he is.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Why did he take those pants?

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
What the fuck is wrong with him?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
So what does he find out at the end?

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
What, what does he learn?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
The whole system's fucked.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.000
And you know, like fucking rich people should die.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000
But anybody that makes more than me, like, like, like billionaires,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
they should, they should have all their money redistributed.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
That's what he finds out.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
But then there's nothing about it.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
That's the end of the film.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Well, I just, that's a lot to take in.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
He's probably need a voiceover.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
But you got, you got all these magic.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
No, he gives all the pants.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
You don't deal with the magic pants.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Why are they magic?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
They're not magic.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
They fit.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Because the traveling pants of the sisterhood, they, it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't like,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
they didn't stop the movie and go, holy fuck, the devil is real.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Like they, it was, it was just the idea that these girls like were bonded in a way.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Like every time they put on the pants, I assume that they fit.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
He's giving his pants away to strangers that aren't characters in the movie.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
He's just giving, as a montage.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And they all fit because he, okay.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000
So they all fit when his, when his like apology is real.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Okay.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
All right.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I got it.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
So the goddess is like a hot woman and her husband died in 9-11.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
And he chokes up on the bat.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Like he changes a couple of things and the pants don't fit.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Why?

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Because he hasn't come clean.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
He's like, it's like a quantum leap rules.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
He's got to, he's got to come a hundred percent clean with the people he gives the pants to

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
or they don't fit.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
And she's like hot.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
So he's like tempted.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
He doesn't want to be a piece of shit and like, because he wants to date her.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:21.000
So he, he kind of, he changes a couple of details about his pants looting and his steak in 9-11

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
and stuff.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And she's like, oh, so you're kind of a hero.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
And he's like, yeah.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
And then she's like, okay, well, let's go on that date.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
And I'm going to wear my new pants to the date.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
And he's like, cool.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I'm going to get so late.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
And it's good.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And then she's like, they don't fit.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.000
And that's like, and then, and then he's like, well, here's another pair.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
And she's like, these don't fit either.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
What the fuck's going on?

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I don't know why she'd be.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000
So it's like, it's like Groundhog Day.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
He has to learn how to be honest.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Like he has to get it right and find out how to make the pants fit on his hot chick.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I think they all become zombies.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
All right.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Well, let's develop it later.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000
We should only spend like a maximum of 20 minutes developing the 9-11.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I don't care if it takes all fucking night.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
We're going to fucking hash this out.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
You know, you let it go.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
You got to step back and then you work on other projects.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Right?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Right.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Let's bring Timorge out in preparation.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Timorge Brown.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Yeah.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Hey, I heard car jumper got canceled at channel 101.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
That was the thing that happened.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Yes.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I was at my rap party for community.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Was that the longest running show of all time?

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
It is.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Absolutely.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
How many episodes?

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
20 what?

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
25.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
25.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
25.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000
25.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
25.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
25.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
25.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
25.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
25.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000
25.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000
25.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
25.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
25.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
25.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
25.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
25.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
25.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000
25.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
25.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
25.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
25.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
25.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
25.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
25.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
25.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000
25.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
25.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
25.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000
25.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
25.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
25.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
25.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
25.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000
35.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
30.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
35.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
35.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000
35.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
35.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
35.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
35.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.360
I feel like because this show, this show's theme so far has been kind of a contemplative

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:54.280
kind of like introspective kind of show.

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:58.880
I feel like we should commit to some shadow run in a way like we really get down to like

01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.880
get into some shit done.

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:00.880
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:01.880
You guys down for that?

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:02.880
All right.

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:09.440
Dan, would you pass out the character sheet folders, pass those down the line?

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.280
But we need a mercy, right?

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.480
Or are you saying even like?

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.480
I think we should.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.480
Yeah.

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.480
Right.

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.480
What do you think?

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.480
Well, yeah.

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:20.480
I mean we should.

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.480
I think we need our face man for sure.

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:22.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:26.120
Do we have somebody out there who feels especially capable of being Mercy or Donald?

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:27.120
Who?

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.120
Who you said woo?

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:29.620
There's a woo there.

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.240
Do you want to come up?

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.120
You wooed.

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:36.120
Get up here woo, woo girl.

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:40.240
Hello.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.640
You can take the mic from up there.

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.640
She's gonna make it on her own.

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.520
She has no parade to throw into the air at that last minute.

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.520
All right woo girl.

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.520
What's your, what's your name?

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:50.520
I'm Julia.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.520
Hi.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.520
Julia.

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.520
There's your folder.

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.520
I'm here by myself.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.520
That's why zero people clapped when I went woo.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.520
Sorry.

01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.520
You know nothing.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.520
I just realized I was really awkward.

01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.520
I'm like hi.

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.520
That's right.

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:07.800
I don't think in a show when people applaud for someone your first thought is, ah the

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.080
fix is in.

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.080
They must have brought 50 people.

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:14.080
Julia was it?

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.080
Yes.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.080
Julia where are you from?

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.080
Originally northeast Ohio.

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.080
Northeast so that would be Toledo?

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.080
Youngster.

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.080
Cleveland-ish.

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:24.080
Cleveland-ish.

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:28.960
I grew up with Amish so like Cleveland and more east.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:29.960
There's a reason why I moved.

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.320
Did you say you grew up with Amish?

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.320
Yeah.

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.320
They have those in Ohio?

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:37.240
I thought that was a Pennsylvania thing.

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.240
And a lot in Ohio.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.240
How did they get there?

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.240
They watched I guess.

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:49.600
You don't have to answer it was a dumb question.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:54.120
I apologize and sorry to my mom if she ever does see this but I'm a little high when I

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.120
need to.

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:56.120
Is your mom Amish?

01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.120
Oh.

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.120
Full disclosure.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.120
You're a little high?

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.120
I might be.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.120
You might be a little high.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.120
I might be.

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.120
Marijuana high?

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.120
Maybe.

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.120
Well that endures you to them.

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.240
They're like okay good.

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:14.240
I'm almost regretting even saying woo and going why don't somebody else go woo please?

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.240
Erin why aren't you here now?

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.720
Because the dog's pooping hairs.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:25.000
Do you want to switch places with Erin right now?

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.520
She's yanking dog string out of a dog anus.

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.520
Almost forgot.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.520
All right.

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.520
Well you're quite a character.

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:39.520
She's like Julie Haggerty meets Mary Tyler Moore meets Ann Margaret.

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.520
Ann Margaret.

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:44.520
Oh my god.

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.320
Did you, how are you living in LA?

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:48.320
I am.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.760
And how long have you been living here?

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.360
A little over a year.

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.120
And what's your ambition?

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:59.720
I kind of accidentally fell into working in the thing I did the most which is podcasting.

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:08.320
And yeah one guy really but I worked for an amazing comedian Erin Foley and if any of

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.320
you know her.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.320
Erin Foley's amazing.

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:15.160
Yeah she's really funny and I'm really fortunate to work with some really funny people.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.720
So you work on Erin Foley's podcast?

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.440
No I help make it happen.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.560
I do this stuff, the minutiae.

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:27.440
Like you're the producer or a producer of her podcast.

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:28.600
The helper of things.

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.200
You book guests and stuff.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.200
Sometimes if she needs it.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.200
You know I'm editor.

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:35.560
Are you an assassin?

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:37.040
I'm a podcast assassin.

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:46.040
But I also do weird voice work and things so yeah so I'm like why not try podcasting.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.040
Why not woo?

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.280
Nobody else wooed, please somebody else should have wooed.

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:55.160
I'm going to go back build a time machine and then I'll be right back.

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:57.160
Oh I'm not nervous.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.160
You're nervous.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:01.600
Nobody feels sorry for me.

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:08.320
It's like she feels like a sitcom character that's just joined our cast.

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:13.160
I'm wearing a skirt, I'm trying not to sit awkwardly where I'm like I kind of have to

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:14.960
sidesettle where I'm like hey.

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.960
I'm an ottoman now.

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:16.960
Hey what's up guys?

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:17.960
This is still weird.

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:23.520
It's going to be a shadow run of all time.

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:27.680
So Julia are you familiar with Mercy O'Donnell's character?

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:28.680
Grace?

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:29.680
Yeah.

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:30.680
Yes.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.680
And you're looking down at her character sheet you're familiar with her attributes?

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:36.960
I'm going to do my best.

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:40.600
I can't wait to be as high as you are after this show.

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:41.800
See me after the show.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.800
Whoa.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.800
Oh damn.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:44.800
Wink.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:45.800
What about me?

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800
You're there too.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.800
That was prenatal.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:48.800
That's her.

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.800
Are you higher than her?

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:50.800
Is she higher than you?

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.800
No man.

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:52.800
I'm not, no.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:32:03.320
I have my answer.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.880
My nervousness manifests itself differently.

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:06.880
That's all.

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:07.880
It's true.

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:08.880
See?

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:19.280
The laugh is like the Warner Brothers sound effect library woman laughing from the 60s.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.080
I'm so sorry.

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:22.840
No, don't.

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:23.840
It's absolutely fine.

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:24.840
She's Mary Tellermore.

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:27.360
A little Goldie Hahn, a little Mary Tellermore.

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:32.680
If you listen back on a few live podcasts of various kinds, you can apparently pick

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.840
me out and I apologize.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:37.280
Oh we have, we have, we got one of those guys right here.

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.760
I know I finally saw him and I'm like oh that's him.

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:40.760
He's the laugh.

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:41.760
That's the laughing guy.

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:42.760
It's the laugh.

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:43.760
Oh my God.

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.760
And it's equal.

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.760
You're the laughing guy?

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.760
Yeah.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.320
I never put a face to you because I was away for all the controversy in your life.

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:50.320
Oh you weren't here for that?

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.320
I was gone for most of that.

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:52.320
It's laughing guy.

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.320
What's your name again?

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:54.320
Laughing guy?

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.320
Doug.

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:56.320
Doug.

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:57.320
Laughing guy.

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.320
What's your podcast, Doug?

01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.320
Just in case you didn't know.

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.320
Oh and we're.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.320
Yeah.

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:02.320
It's called You and Me and Thoughts and Talk.

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.120
You and Me and Thoughts and Talk with Doug Culp.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.120
How do you get through it?

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:08.320
Like, isn't it just you, like, like.

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:10.600
Yeah, it is.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.600
He does laugh on it.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.600
Oh can I say one more thing really quick.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:20.280
I was actually listening to Super Ego on the way over here and I had no idea.

01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:22.720
You were the Sam Elliott.

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.560
That's one of my favorite bits with Shunt McGuffin.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:26.560
Oh yeah.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.880
I had no idea and then I heard Dana Harmon and I was like, oh wait, the Muppet one.

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:30.880
That's all.

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:31.880
Sorry.

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:32.880
Jeff does a good Sam Elliott.

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:33.880
I apologize.

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.880
I'm not going to have that much next time.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.880
I'm so sorry you guys.

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:38.880
Alright, Julia.

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:39.880
Here's the status.

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:40.880
You're high.

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:41.880
You're here.

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.880
Yeah.

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:43.880
You're about to play Shatter Run with us.

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:44.880
I'm going to try.

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:48.680
My advice to you is to let it wash over you and to dig deep and as we play Shatter Run.

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:51.480
Spencer, do we have a guest intro?

01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:54.880
Yeah, I think it's by Let's Be Safe But Again.

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.880
Alright.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:58.280
A lot of people have been sending, not a lot.

01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.880
People have been sending me in.

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:01.880
A lot of the ones I haven't read were too long.

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:05.640
If anyone's curious, wants to revise their work, no offense.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.200
What's a good range for length?

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.200
I don't know.

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:11.480
It's just, I mean, if you write it, read it out loud and see how long it takes.

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:14.480
Yeah, I would say 45 seconds is probably a good thing, right?

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:15.480
Yeah.

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:16.480
We run a tight ship over here.

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:17.480
We really do.

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:22.280
If our show is proofing anything, get your shit together.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.600
Well, I kind of do, right?

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:26.040
I got to keep a tight ship.

01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:27.040
You do.

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.040
No, you should.

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.040
Yeah, I do.

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.540
You're allowed to.

01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:32.540
Thank you.

01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:38.880
You're saying to those would-be intro Shatter Run people, writers, keep it around under

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:39.880
a minute.

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.480
Yeah, no offense.

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:42.480
It's good stuff.

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:46.360
It's all good stuff.

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:48.200
Thanks to our video listeners.

01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:53.360
All right, Spencer, take it away.

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:59.080
All right.

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:04.480
Last time on Harmontown, Shadow Town, after completing their first mission, the gang

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:10.440
kicked back for some much-needed R&R, lounging around the pool table at their usual watering

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.440
hole.

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.440
Hanks last stand.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.400
They indulged in their favorite vices.

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:20.040
Their moment of peace was shattered when an old, extremely Italian man named Ryan Dervish

01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:23.600
barged in screaming, jittery, and jumping.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:28.360
After calming down, he explained that the notorious Spaguli crime family has kidnapped

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:29.920
his son, Jelly.

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:35.560
One over by his offer of 2,000 new yin a piece and a pair of fancy Italian shoes, our heroes

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:39.040
accepted the mission to retrieve Jelly Dervish.

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:44.440
The old man intimated that Arturo Spaguli, a big, stupid dick, might know something

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.400
about the kidnapping.

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:51.600
The gang resolved to confront Arturo at his favorite eatery, the Burger Tyrant.

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:54.960
But will they find stupid Arturo, the big dick?

01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:00.240
Will they use their well-known skills and famous teamwork to extract information?

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:04.960
Will they retrieve Jelly Dervish with their usual discretion and grace?

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:11.960
Doubts on a Harmontown, Shadow Tyrant, thank you.

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:21.920
Okay, so we're on our way to a restaurant to, uh, to, uh, we're going to the Burger

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:22.920
Tyrant?

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:28.080
Yeah, you're headed towards the Bu, uh, the Burger Tyrant, the Buber Tyrant.

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:30.800
Well, what kind of vehicle are we in right now?

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.800
You're in an Uber.

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:32.800
We're in an Uber.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.720
What's our, uh, hey, driver, what's your name?

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:36.720
It's a robot.

01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:37.720
Robot, what's your...

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:43.320
Is the robot programmed to sexually harass women, or does that slowly drop away as the

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.320
Uber enters the future?

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:49.040
And is the robot, is the robot programmed after you get out of the car to keep the meter

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:53.200
running and pretend that the ride is canceled but charge you for a ride that you didn't

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.200
do and keep running in the meantime?

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.200
Oh, shit.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.200
Gauntlet.

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:58.200
Down.

01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.200
All of those things.

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.200
Yet we never use Lyft.

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.200
I use Lyft all the fucking time.

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:02.200
Lyft is great.

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.200
The Uber comes...

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.200
Driving you happy.

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.200
Suck a dick.

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.200
That's what they say.

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.600
Hey, uh, hey, uh, robot, how far away from my Burger Tyrant?

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:10.960
Oh, we're pretty close.

01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:16.440
You guys should, uh, have just enough time to formulate a plan.

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:17.440
Nightblade.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.440
What you got?

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:26.520
Uh, not the planning type of such, but, uh, I just want to get straight in my head, uh,

01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:30.040
this guy, uh, he's the one who might know where Jelly is.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.040
Arturo Spaguli.

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.040
Yeah.

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.040
He's a dick.

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.040
All right.

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:38.720
Uh, so we should probably lure him out, uh, figure out a way to get him by himself.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:43.120
Uh, got a feeling he'll be probably surrounded by a lot of, a lot of guys.

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.200
Hey, um, Hortegaard, can you find out what kind of car Arturo Spaguli drives?

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:53.280
Is it, is it possible that I could, uh, possibly, uh, re-contact, uh, my friend Rich Bielsen?

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.280
Uh, yeah.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.280
Rich?

01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.280
Rich.

01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:58.280
Yes.

01:37:58.280 --> 01:37:59.280
Hey.

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.280
How are you?

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.280
Hey, it's Rich.

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.280
Hey.

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.880
Don't, uh, be aggressive with me.

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:05.880
Oh.

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.480
This is just my voice.

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.480
Okay.

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:14.200
Um, there's, uh, we obviously were looking for this, uh, this asshole, this sort of dick,

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:15.200
the person.

01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.200
Yeah.

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.000
Um, is that it possible that we could lead, lead, lure him?

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.960
Is there something that would bring him out, perhaps, uh, uh, since he's been drinking

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:28.680
a glass of water, or, uh, is there some other sort of totem that we might bring him outside

01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:31.480
with, to get him outside of his protection?

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:32.480
Hmm.

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:33.480
That's a good question.

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.280
I don't really know the guy personally.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.920
I just, uh, I put some, I put some, you know, some of my ears out and found out that's where

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:40.920
he is.

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.080
You might, you might have better luck asking around elsewhere.

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.880
Is it, uh, oh, you still talking to this guy?

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:52.600
Is it possible that I could use another identity and perhaps go in and lure him out myself?

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:53.840
It's certainly possible.

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:58.920
Is it also possible that we could use our, uh, our, our, our fabulous face?

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:02.160
The one to the right of me, although you're not looking at me right now, but the one to

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:03.160
the right of me.

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.320
I say we, we, we, we send in the fabulous way.

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:11.040
I say we use, uh, Mercy O'Donnell as much as possible on this mission.

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.280
I think this is Mercy's time to shine.

01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.280
Yeah.

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.320
I knew I was going to make it.

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:20.400
Mercy, uh, uh, uh, driver, are we here at the burger challenge?

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.320
Uh, we're just pulling up to three blocks away.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:29.240
Rich Billson, Rich Billson, uh, there are a few times that I will say this.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:32.240
I apologize for, uh, uh, abusing your time.

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:33.760
I will make this up to you later.

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:34.760
We have a plan.

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.280
Uh, we've come up with it on our own.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.280
Uh, good day, sir.

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.280
Thanks, man.

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:42.080
Let's do, uh, let's do a blue beauty with a honeypot on the front end.

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:45.520
Do you think it's a good idea?

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.080
Seems to be the configuration.

01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.080
Okay.

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.080
Most conducive in the situation.

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.080
I'll be, I'll be the honeypot.

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.080
No, wait.

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:57.440
Uh, if I could, uh, perhaps the honeypot could be somebody else.

01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.080
Is that possible?

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:02.600
Do we, do we know his sexual proclivities?

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.400
Do we know, you know, when he's saying this?

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:09.840
You have a face that is irresistible regardless of sexual proclivities.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:10.840
It deals in the currency.

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.840
I can't tell you how many times I've said it.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:13.840
Hey, guys, guys.

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:14.840
The currency of raw traction.

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:15.840
I huddled everybody up.

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:19.040
I said, look, I think that we'd be fooling ourselves if we didn't think the best plan

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:25.640
is to send Mercy O'Donnell just right in the front door as the, as the honeypot.

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:33.280
Your job is to get him, get him over to, uh, our prearranged location, uh, which is, which

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:36.400
is just out back of the burger tyrant.

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:37.400
Okay.

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.000
So we're at the front of the burger tyrant.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.480
You're three blocks away.

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.040
We're three blocks away still.

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.200
Could the driver perhaps pull up to the back of the, well, if we get too close, they're

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.560
going to, they're going to send something's up.

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:50.560
Okay.

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:51.560
Let's stop.

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:52.560
I mean, I can walk.

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:56.480
Should we stop a block away nightblade and let Mercy O'Donnell walk in the front?

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:59.760
I don't get my Beyonce stride on.

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:03.040
I think you, I think you go in, we do, we do one of these.

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:11.520
You go in and then, uh, like, uh, we stage a, uh, she has a falling out with her, uh,

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:17.080
her boy and then wait, I'm trying to figure out how to, like, why don't you be the boy?

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.760
She'll, uh, and then she's going to get him out to the car.

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:24.440
If the simple version is she just gets him out to the car and then we're all in the car.

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.640
The more complex version is to get him even further away.

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:30.360
Why can't I just try and convince him to come with me into the car?

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.360
I think we just let her do her thing.

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.360
Okay.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.360
All right.

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:35.360
First we let this happen.

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:36.360
Yeah.

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.360
And let her get him outside of the building and then we work on it.

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.360
Well, we're all, we're all listening.

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.360
We'll all be in the car.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.760
You just get him out into the car.

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:42.760
Yeah.

01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:43.760
All right.

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:44.760
Yeah.

01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:50.760
I played this on focus at this time, so yeah, yeah, another hour of unfocused.

01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:51.760
All right.

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.160
So are we a block away?

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.160
Yes.

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.160
Spencer.

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.160
Yep.

01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.160
All right.

01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:59.160
Mercy.

01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:00.160
Yes.

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.160
I trust you implicitly.

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:02.160
You really should.

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:03.160
I got this.

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.160
Go knock him dead.

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:09.160
I have exceptional charisma and, uh, negotiation top notch.

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:13.160
Is it possible I could be both a physical and emotional spotter?

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:19.160
Please, I think maybe not hovering in the background, but perhaps just staying close

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.400
by in case things go awry.

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.400
Yeah.

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:23.640
It could go off the rails.

01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:27.400
It may very well.

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:30.600
So what's the move gentlemen and lady?

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.600
It's mercy time.

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:34.160
It's fucking mercy time.

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.160
All right.

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.760
Mercy, go in there and work your charms.

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:37.760
Okay.

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:42.560
So get, get, go, go meet our tourist bagouli and try to find out and get him out to the

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:43.760
car with us.

01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.760
Okay.

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.960
So right now it's just me and walking in.

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.560
Oh, you must whip it.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:51.560
Okay.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:55.360
So I get to the burger tyrant.

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:56.360
Walk in.

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:58.360
What's, what's the surrounding?

01:42:58.360 --> 01:42:59.360
All right.

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:03.880
So, uh, the burger tyrant is classic garbage food of the sixth world, 3D printers, squirting

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:09.120
out grease and krill protein into recognizable shapes injected with flavor simulates and

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.280
microwave it for perfection to perfection.

01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:15.520
Burger tyrant is the pinnacle of the technology serving millions of day.

01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:17.040
This location looks pretty new.

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:22.240
So it must have been rebuilt to the tyrant's new security slash hygiene specifications.

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:27.320
Standing tall in front of the front door is a hologram icon of the burger tyrant himself.

01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:33.440
His arms are open wide and he proclaims, all are welcome and get your burgers done right.

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:37.160
But please, oh please don't go and fight.

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.240
Leave your weapons at home.

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:41.120
Leave your weapons at home.

01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:43.360
Leave your weapons at home.

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.880
This guy's a real burger tyrant.

01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.600
He's really into that.

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:51.600
All right.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.600
I like it.

01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:58.960
Just to be safe, I astrally project alongside Mercy, like to go alongside or into the burger

01:43:58.960 --> 01:43:59.960
tyrant.

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:00.960
Okay.

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:01.960
You're, you're a ghost.

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:02.960
Okay.

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:03.960
Could be dangerous.

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.360
You go first.

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:08.680
Try not to ghost block.

01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:13.880
So you step into the, you step into the burger tyrant, it's, it's a filthy joint.

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:19.800
It looks like it must be one of those franchise locations rather than a corporate place specifically

01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:23.240
because the security detail is woefully substandard.

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:27.600
There's usually about five armed guards on duty at your average burger tyrant.

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.040
Here you only see one.

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:32.920
He's wearing a bulletproof vest and he's picking his nose.

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:39.040
The second you walk into the door, however, you hear a piercing shrill alarm shriek, blights

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:44.600
start flashing and going off right as you, right as you, uh, enter the door and three

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:50.640
fry cooks and, uh, the security guard all pull guns and level pistols right at you.

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:52.600
They say no weapons.

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.600
Get out of here.

01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:55.000
We're shooting you to death.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.040
Hey, hey, calm down.

01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:58.040
No weapons.

01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.120
Hey, hold on.

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:00.120
It's law.

01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.120
Hold on.

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.120
Just a second.

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:04.360
Let's just step it back.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.360
No weapons.

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.360
Hold on.

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:11.680
What if, can I, uh, like coat check these because there's some way I can just drop these

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.440
off, pick them up on my way out.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.440
Yeah.

01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:17.360
Go outside, do that, then come back and we'll give you burgers.

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:20.880
Hey, hey, that sounds amazing.

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:21.880
Thank you for complying.

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:24.960
Hey, no worries, no worries, not a problem.

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:27.360
Uh, I'll be right back.

01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:31.400
Uh, I am just outside the door and ready to collect such weapons.

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:32.400
Excellent.

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.520
I've taken them all.

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:39.400
So I have no, so I have zero weapons.

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:40.400
Okay.

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:45.960
Oh, I feel like, I feel like Marcy right now, just very scared, but I'm going to power

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:46.960
through.

01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:48.160
So I'm going back in there.

01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:49.160
All right.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.640
You do that.

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:55.160
You see the, the, the fry cooks, they're not pointing guns at you anymore.

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.440
They're just milling about the auto fooders.

01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:00.360
There's a couple of folks just sitting with their meals.

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.400
See Arturo Spagulli seated in the corner.

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.520
He's wearing a fine Italian suit and he's eating, he's eating two burgers in two hands.

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.520
Whoa.

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.320
He's double fisting the meat.

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:15.800
He's double fisting both meats.

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:19.640
Given the circumstances, can I use my cobalt sense instantly just to find out if there

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:20.640
is any threat?

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.640
Oh, there's threats.

01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:22.640
Like with the meat undercooked?

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:29.640
The meat is always cooked in this place, hot meat, always.

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:30.640
Yes.

01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:31.640
Threats.

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:32.640
Okay.

01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:33.640
End of the comlink.

01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:34.640
Okay.

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.640
He does that a lot.

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.640
He's like, it's like, how many of these people are my friends?

01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:50.640
That's like, well, they're trying to kill you.

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:52.640
Says the man sitting in the van.

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:53.640
That's it.

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:54.640
I'm checking my email.

01:46:54.640 --> 01:47:02.640
This isn't really, you know, a resume for my proclivities.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:06.640
All right.

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:07.640
What's the move?

01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:08.640
Hey, real quick.

01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:12.640
Do I actually have, I mean, I said that I gave all my weapons.

01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:15.640
What are you from Atlanta?

01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:23.640
One of my friends used to get really high and then he would start just, he would go from

01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:24.640
like, what's up guys?

01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:25.640
Like, hi.

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:27.640
They can't see who you're talking to right now.

01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.640
You have to talk to the man.

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:31.640
Oh, I apologize.

01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:33.640
Apparently I lose control of my vocals.

01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:34.640
You're fine.

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:36.640
I'm sorry, you guys.

01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:37.640
Okay.

01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:39.640
So I'm trying to get back on task.

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:40.640
Back on the train.

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:41.640
Sorry.

01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:43.640
Spencer, I actually have a real question.

01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:44.640
Yeah.

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:45.640
About your weapons?

01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:46.640
Yeah.

01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:51.640
So knife, do I actually have like any hidden anything that I can get through is, I mean,

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.640
is there a chance I could sneak something through just in case?

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:55.640
You don't think so.

01:47:55.640 --> 01:48:00.640
You know, in today's day and age, weapon and metal detectors are highly, highly elaborate.

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:04.640
You'd have to have a weapon designed specifically to bypass that security.

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:05.640
All right.

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:06.640
I was just double checking.

01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:07.640
Just double checking.

01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:11.640
I go in the comment and say, Mercy, ask him to go outside with you.

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.640
If that's not going to work, we're going to come storm into place and kick ass.

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:16.640
Yeah, it's not really that kind of mission, you know.

01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:17.640
No, I'm just going to convince him.

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:20.640
Objectify you or anything, but you know.

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:21.640
Yeah.

01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:23.640
I just got to try and somehow convince him to come out.

01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:24.640
Just ask him and see what happens.

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:25.640
Just make the approach.

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.640
Yeah.

01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.640
Put on your finest face.

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:30.640
I tried that hours ago.

01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:31.640
I apologize.

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:32.640
Okay.

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.640
So.

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:34.640
Oh, Jim.

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:35.640
Oh, Jim.

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:36.640
Sorry, DeMorge.

01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:37.640
Oh, my God.

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:38.640
Okay.

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:49.640
So I'm going in there and who's with me again?

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:50.640
No one.

01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:51.640
Well, you're all alone.

01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:52.640
You're wrong.

01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:53.640
There's the ghost.

01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:54.640
Mercy.

01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:55.640
I'm on the comlink.

01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:56.640
I'm talking to you.

01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:57.640
This is Eve Libertine talking.

01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:58.640
You're a ghost right now.

01:48:58.640 --> 01:48:59.640
I'm talking to you.

01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:01.640
Can I talk to you on comlink in my astral form?

01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:03.640
No, you could talk to her as a ghost.

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.640
Oh, so he like.

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.640
Ghost talking.

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.640
I'm in the room with you.

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.640
I'm actually in the room with you.

01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:10.640
I got you.

01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:13.640
If you want me to manifest and kick ass, I can't walk up to him and tell him what you want.

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:22.640
I already got him outside alone.

01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:23.640
Wait a minute.

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:24.640
What?

01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:25.640
Okay.

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:26.640
So.

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:31.640
Walk up to Arturo Spagulli and say, would you come outside with us?

01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:32.640
Arturo.

01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:33.640
Me.

01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:35.640
You walk up to him and he's got a mouth full of burger.

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:37.640
He's, he's barely paying you any mind.

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.640
He barely glances at you.

01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:43.640
The comlink I suggest you know how to do this the right way.

01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:48.640
The right way?

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:50.640
In your window.

01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:51.640
Okay.

01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:52.640
Arturo.

01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:54.640
How are you?

01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:57.640
I'm hungry.

01:49:57.640 --> 01:49:58.640
Hungry.

01:49:58.640 --> 01:49:59.640
Yeah.

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:00.640
Yeah.

01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:02.640
I like, I like some meats.

01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:05.640
Not so much ham, but I like meat.

01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:06.640
Okay.

01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:13.640
So I haven't stopped thinking about ham from earlier.

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.640
George, I'm so sorry.

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:16.640
I'm like embarrassing.

01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:18.640
Stay in the pocket kid.

01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:19.640
Okay.

01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:20.640
Okay.

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:21.640
The musicians have a phrase.

01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:22.640
It's called staying in the pocket.

01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:23.640
Okay.

01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:24.640
Okay.

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:25.640
I apologize.

01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:26.640
Stay focused.

01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:27.640
Stay focused, mercy.

01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:28.640
Get him outside, mercy.

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:29.640
All right.

01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:30.640
So I know you're hungry, but you know what?

01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:31.640
I did something.

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:32.640
I didn't want to tell you.

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:35.640
I didn't want to tell you, but we have an amazing buffet.

01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:39.640
And this whole party that we planned for you,

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:41.640
I just didn't think that maybe.

01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:44.640
Talk about what we'll do with the meats.

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:48.640
Hard to guide you.

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:49.640
Wait, wait.

01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:50.640
You want me to expound?

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:54.640
Get him outside, mercy.

01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:58.640
We planned a giant surprise party for you,

01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:02.640
basically for this award we heard you were getting.

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:11.640
And so, I mean, I can't think of anything else.

01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:12.640
More of that.

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:13.640
More amazing than that.

01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:14.640
Ask him to go outside.

01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.640
And I think that.

01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:16.640
Just say, hey.

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:18.640
The limo that we have.

01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:21.640
Mercy, say, hey, go outside with me.

01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:23.640
I'll suck your dick.

01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:26.640
Fucking go outside.

01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:28.640
Anything.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:32.640
When a girl, when a young girl, who is a ghost,

01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:34.640
tells you to suck a dick.

01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:38.640
Just ask him to go outside.

01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:41.640
Say you have a joint and you're going to fucking get high again.

01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:44.640
Hey, Arturo, I got some, like, a choice cush.

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:47.640
Let's blaze, yo.

01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:48.640
Oh, man.

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.640
Who wouldn't want to get high and play Skyrim with me?

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:57.640
Or you can sit next to me and watch me make this amazing waterfall out of lava.

01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:01.640
Oh, I was thinking about Minecraft because I play Minecraft.

01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:07.640
I'm outside and I want to be inside so that I can go outside again.

01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:08.640
Oh, my gosh.

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:09.640
I need to socialize more.

01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:10.640
I'm so sorry.

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:15.640
Shit in the cup.

01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:22.640
That sounds mighty fine.

01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:26.640
Cliffhanger!

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:28.640
Results?

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:30.640
That's a good thing.

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:33.640
Let's thank Julia, everybody, shall we?

01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:34.640
It's not Julia.

01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:36.640
Holy shit.

01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:43.640
Julia, if I can make one request, you come back next week and be twice as high.

01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:46.640
And reprise your role as Mercy O'Donnell.

01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:48.640
Erin won't be here.

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:51.640
I don't know that, but either way, you fucking, you're on stage and you're high.

01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:52.640
DeMorge Brown, everybody.

01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:54.640
Spencer Crittenden.

01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:59.640
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:02.640
Let's thank also Annie for coming up earlier on.

01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:04.640
Annie.

01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:05.640
Ginny also.

01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.640
Thank you very much.

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:12.640
Your mayor, Mr. Dan Hyman, everybody.

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:14.640
Nothing got done.

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:21.640
We walked into a burger place and nothing really happened.

01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:28.640
We got into an Uber and then somebody went into the burger place.

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:32.640
They went into the burger place.

01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:34.640
Did you get any of that?

01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:52.640
It's a good show.
