{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Commerce and the Meltdown Theater, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:12.000 --> 00:24.000\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:46.000\nThank you very much. I was minecrafting. I'm not really ready to do the show.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:53.000\nWhat happened recently on Minecraft? Get us up to date on where you were as you left Minecraft.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:58.000\nI have a new base that I built up in the sky. It's a cube of marble.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:06.000\nAnd inside of it is a glass room with these powered spawners that creates zombies that bring zombies into the world.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:10.000\nAnd then there's these machines on all sides that immediately murder them.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:17.000\nAnd then all of their brains and flesh go through conduits into a central chest underneath that chamber.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:27.000\nAnd then I just finished making an elaborate system that like a serial killer's elaborate turn of the century world fair murder castle\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:34.000\nsorts their armor off and melts it down into gold and anything that they were carrying.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:36.000\nIt's just sorted all out.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:44.000\nAnd then you take their flesh and their flesh gets teleported into a tesseract that funnels down into these vats\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:50.000\nand is combined with sugar from these fields of cane that I had growing on the roof of my cube.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:55.000\nSo the cube is a cube of marble with sugar cane growing on the roof.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:58.000\nAnd it's just being constantly harvested and that gets turned into sugar.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:06.000\nAnd the sugar is combined with the zombie flesh and forms a nutrient juice that powers my whole operation.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:12.000\nI have these generators. Thank you. Thank you. You should applaud.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:19.000\nWelcome to Nuremberg 1939.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nHarvesting flesh to power your...\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:24.000\nIt does make you feel a little... I mean they're zombies.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:27.000\nBut they were created by me.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:32.000\nLike I did summon them into the world with my machine only to harvest their flesh and brains and stuff.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:36.000\nIs this part of a menu that happens when you first get the game?\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:43.000\nNo, no. It's probably a lot of mod packs. I've told you I'm playing the... I told you, Jeff.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:45.000\nDamn, we don't talk as much as we used to.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:50.000\nIt's the Beast Infinity mod pack. It's if you're interested in it.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:56.000\nSo you summon zombies only to murder them and harvest their parts to fuel your war engine?\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nYes.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:06.000\nThey're zombie generators. They each generate 80 red stone flux points of energy per tick.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:09.000\nA tick is a tenth of a second, I think.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:17.000\nSo each zombie generator generates 80 and I have just a wall of them and they all run on this nutrient distillation\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:23.000\nand then they funnel the energy into a big giant capacitor and then that charges everything.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:26.000\nLike my jet pack and stuff like that.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nYour jet pack?\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\nOh yeah. Got to have a jet pack.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:35.000\nIs there a first person or third person element to this where you're flying around?\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:38.000\nIt's a first person experience.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:44.000\nSo you're on a jet pack flying around through your sky cloud zombie killing?\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:46.000\nYep. Alone.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:50.000\nIs there any companionship? Is there anybody out there?\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nJust you out there with the zombies.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:56.000\nJust the comforting screams of their...\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:01.000\nI usually put it on mute because it's a little disturbing.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:07.000\nI keep my bedroom far away from where you can hear their cries of anguish and confusion.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:12.000\nI'm sure they're very confused. They're like, hmm, brains, what am I brains?\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:16.000\nYeah, it's pretty great. What am I doing?\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:22.000\nI'm not saying this to be glib or smart assy. What is the payoff?\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nWhat's the serotonin?\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:28.000\nIt's never going to end if that's what you were asking.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nMy wife is always asking. It's never going to end.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:34.000\nShe's like, did you win yet? No, I did not win yet.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:40.000\nWhat's the visceral experience of that?\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:46.000\nJust getting fatter and...\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:55.000\nIt's a world where every decision you make can result, if you choose it to, in perfect order.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:58.000\nIt's a perfect organization. Listen to that.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:05.000\nI took the zombies and I turned them into electricity and their pants get turned into gold.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:12.000\nThere's a place for everything and you just sort things and build them and you can create anything.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:21.000\nIt's like digital Legos. I need that in my life because nobody has that in real life.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:25.000\nBecause the rest of life is too disordered.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:32.000\nThere's no result. If you could go out in the street and the lady could go, help, help, my wallet.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:37.000\nThere's a guy stealing her wallet and you're like, he's kind of smaller than me.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nI'm going to do the right thing here.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:45.000\nThen you go up and go, hey, get your damn hands off her and the guy just stabs you.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:50.000\nAnd the woman's like, we tricked you.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:53.000\nWe're like a pair of people that do this.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nTake his blood, take his blood. Let's get out of here.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nTurn his pants into gold.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:05.000\nIn real life, you could be the zombie that's generated by an autospawner.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nOur friend Annie from South by Southwest is here tonight.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:14.000\nYou think in her Minecraft games she would say, give me spinal stenosis?\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nAre you here, Annie?\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:20.000\nOkay, there you are.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nHello, Annie.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:28.000\nPeople didn't like my offhanded glib use of you as an analogy.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:33.000\nWell, Annie's here. She can confirm now.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nI was glad to hear you were going to be here.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:39.000\nDid you just schedule an LA trip by coincidence or did you?\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:40.000\nI live here.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nOh, you live here? What were you doing in South by Southwest?\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:46.000\nI was there to go to the community stuff.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nOh.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:52.000\nDo you want to come up here? Is it easy enough?\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nCan we move that table so that she needs her walking?\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:00.000\nOh, really? Okay, you can do it.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.000\nLet's welcome Annie over to wherever she is.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nHello, Annie.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:15.000\nResplendent and pink sweater and pink bow.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nThank you.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:22.000\nOkay, so we met you at South by Southwest, which was very loud and I didn't listen to the broadcast.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:25.000\nI don't know if it was like too loud for the listeners or anything.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:26.000\nOh, man.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:27.000\nI couldn't tell.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nBecause last time we were there, it was the same thing.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nBut then I listened to it and I was like, well, it's not so bad.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nGood thing we didn't spend the whole podcast like going, hey, what's with these people talking?\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:40.000\nBecause when I listened to it, I was like, ah, you can't really, you know, you can hear like a background sound effect.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nIt's like we're doing a show to Fudruckers or something.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:47.000\nBut this time it was just unavoidable.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nLike everyone that came up had to address it.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:52.000\nWe went over to the bar a thousand times and said, keep it down.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nDidn't we send you over there at some point?\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:57.000\nMy friend Jessica went and we were like cheering her on.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nAnd Erin went over.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nErin was the best because she would go over and be like, hi, what's your name?\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:02.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:03.000\nShut the fuck up.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nSo it was perfect.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nI don't know.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nYeah, they got to figure.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nWe got to ask more questions before we go back to South by.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:12.000\nYeah.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:15.000\nI thought this time the place would be sealed up because of Yahoo and stuff.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nLet's ask for a theater next time.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:21.000\nWell, the open bar was the problem because everybody was standing around the bar and everybody wanted drinks.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:25.000\nAnd they were talking to people at the bar because obviously you can't really hear what's going on at the show.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nBut also those people at the bar, they were not at the Harmontown.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nNo, a lot of them were just, you know.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:35.000\nYeah, they were just hanging out, like talking about like e-wallets and stuff.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:39.000\nSo we met you there.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nAnd I don't know how much they could hear.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:47.000\nBut we asked you about your walker and then found out you have this tragic spinal stenosis.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nYou were walking down the hall one day.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:50.000\nDown.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:53.000\nJust fell down and found out you're not going to be able to walk over again.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.000\nIt's going to get kind of worse as it goes.\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:03.000\nAnd then it came up that you're a big Annie Edison fan and that your name is Annie with one N.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:07.000\nAnd that you have a blog where you talk about what Annie wears.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:15.000\nAnd that you were bummed out about the move from skirts to pants, which a move I made to be a decent human being.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:18.000\nI understood your logic behind all of it.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\nYou were just wrong.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:22.000\nYeah, yeah, I know.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nSo it's fine.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nWhat was your guilt about that, Danny?\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nYou felt like you were being exploitative?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:36.000\nYeah, I'm looking at, you know, that character outfits differently.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:40.000\nI'm not going like, oh, that old innocent schoolgirl thing.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:41.000\nI'm a pig.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:49.000\nAnd also, the character is growing and changing, so I thought, well, is she just in this stasis?\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:57.000\nDoes she just have 11,000 short skirts and pairs of tights and cardigan sweaters in this closet?\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:58.000\nYou should literally see my closet.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nIt's like half cardigans, half dresses.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:05.000\nSo we put you in charge of wardrobe for the finale episode.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:10.000\nThere's a couple of scenes where she's dressed in accordance with your wishes.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:15.000\nWe actually connected you with our wardrobe supervisor.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:16.000\nIt's true.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nShe still has not responded to me.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:19.000\nI'm not like mad.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nI'm not like trying to be like, hey, I'm very upset at all of this.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nI asked a bunch of questions, and I think it was a little too much.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:29.000\nI was literally three tweets with the questions, like this and this and this and that.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nI think it was overwhelming.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:32.000\nYeah.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nAnd also, you're associated with me.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:43.000\nThe people that work underneath me are not big fans of, last night was the rap party for season six,\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:49.000\nand it's always a tradition where I come up with a new way to promise that I'll figure out how to run a show.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:53.000\nAll the new people are like, yeah, good speech, man.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:58.000\nAnd all the Rhonda the prop master for six years is over in the corner.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:05.000\nIf she smoked, she'd just have a cigarette dangling like, yeah, it's always going to be different.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nHe's really learning.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nWait, so you already shot the Annie last episode then?\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nYeah.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nSomebody tweeted me a picture actually of it.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:18.000\nI don't know how they managed to find this, but I guess there was somebody released a picture of everybody on set,\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:21.000\nand then somebody tweeted it to me and was like, hey, this is your outfit.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nIs it all right?\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:24.000\nDid we get it?\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.000\nYeah, no.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nI mean, well, it's not really a purple sweater.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nI would definitely not call that purple.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nRight.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:34.000\nLiterally what happened, I wish this was a more glorious story,\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:37.000\nbut literally what happened was they sent me pictures of two outfits,\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:41.000\nliterally in the combinations that they were in on the show.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:45.000\nSo all the items had previously been worn, and it was only two outfits.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:49.000\nSo what I said was, can we swap that sweater for this dress,\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:53.000\nbecause at least then it's a new combination of things she's already worn.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nThat was my amazing costume designing.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:59.000\nYou were as, yeah.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nWelcome to Hollywood, Annie.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nIt's great to be here, Chef.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:07.000\nI did have a little bit of a shithead shit-fit tantrum.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:10.000\nI remember on the way to a meeting, because I was looking at these emails,\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.000\nand I was going like, wait, there was a picture of a black sweater,\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:16.000\nand I was like, the only thing I remember is a purple sweater.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nThat's all I know.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:21.000\nHow is that the one thing that's different?\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:25.000\nAnd then they said that you were in contact with them, so after a point,\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nI was like, okay, as long as I look like a good person.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nSpencer.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nThat was my goal here.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nThis is the real, yeah.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nNo, Spencer got in contact with me, actually,\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:39.000\nand I also talked to Kevin and somebody else, and things worked out.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nWhat are you holding there?\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:47.000\nI'm holding a fan, because I'm afraid at any moment I'm going to heat up and be needing this.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nIt's a little worm in here. You know why?\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nVery popular podcast.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nIt's like the zombie generators.\n\n12:54.000 --> 13:00.000\nYou could power a marble base with this room, all these brains and flesh.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:03.000\nWhat does a marble base afford you?\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nI don't know, it just looks pretty. It's white.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nOkay.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nEverything down on the earth.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nWhat is your home base? Are you building a villa?\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:17.000\nLike a home, like a fortress of solitude? What do you have there?\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:23.000\nIt's like a big computer kind of that takes in or takes in everything.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nIs there an architectural aesthetic to it?\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:29.000\nIs it a white cube with multiple levels?\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:32.000\nIt's not about aesthetics, it's about function.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nWhat about the aesthetic of function?\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:37.000\nWhen you look at it, you're like, this guy's functioning,\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nand he doesn't give a shit about anything, it's a power.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:45.000\nAncient Rome functioned, but they still had...\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:49.000\nI mean, shizzle a couple of columns when I'm finished with everything being working.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:52.000\nI could take a shizzle and I could make some things.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:55.000\nYou can? Can you make it look artistic? You can.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nYeah, you like it now.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:01.000\nI have no idea what we're talking about.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nBut I do like the idea that one day you would graduate from function.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nWhen you got everything you wanted, when you achieved the heights of whatever you wanted,\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nyou would start becoming like an artistic...\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nYeah.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:17.000\nI would save that for last, yeah.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:22.000\nI would be like, okay, now I care if there's a pot in the corner with a plant in it.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.000\nBut up until the moment when you're a god, why would you care?\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:29.000\nIf I were a third-person Minecrafter walking up,\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:35.000\nI ran afoul of your kingdom and I saw out in the distance a giant building,\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nwhich is where you dwell.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nI would just see a big cube.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nYou would see, first of all, you would go, oh my god, what happened?\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:47.000\nBecause there's just these giant rectangular holes in the earth.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:52.000\nI built an ender quarry and I just put it on a diamond upgrade\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nand it just goes...\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:59.000\nAnd I just scoop up the earth down to bedrock so there's just lava.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:02.000\nSo far, that's ancient Rome.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:07.000\nAs you get to Rome, there's quarries and mines and chain gangs and bad things happening.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:11.000\nYeah, you'd be like, oh my god, what horrible monster did all this?\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:14.000\nAnd then you'd look up on the sky and he'd go, is that the sun?\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:15.000\nNo, it's my home.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nAre you living in the sky?\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:18.000\nYes, I live in the sky.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:21.000\nYou live in a marbled cube in the sky?\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.000\nYes, I do.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:26.000\nOkay, that's... I like that. That's good.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nDo you play Minecraft, Annie?\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:29.000\nNo, I do not.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nYou play video games?\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:33.000\nI do play video games. I do. I'm actually really addicted.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:40.000\nI don't know if anybody knows this really old game that was on Linux called Chips Challenge.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:44.000\nYeah, there was a Microsoft version in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack in the 90s.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:48.000\nAnyway, I just discovered that some amazing humans with way too much time in their hands\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:52.000\nhave put all these level packs in and you can actually play it on the iPhone.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:56.000\nSo that's actually what I waste all my time on is playing this fake version of Chips Challenge\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:59.000\nbecause it's like my childhood on my phone.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nIs it like an ASCII game?\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:05.000\nNo, it's just like when the graphics are pretty shitty, it's two-dimensional\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:09.000\nand you have to collect chips in the original game and then knock off its coins\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:12.000\nbut it's all puzzles, so you have to push the block into the water\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:16.000\nto make sure that the creature doesn't come get you and yada-yada-yada.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nIt's starting to sound like Minecraft, I like it.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:22.000\nYeah, it's definitely like a precursor except this is all puzzle-based.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:25.000\nSo it's like everything is like you have to get to the end and how are you going to do that.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:28.000\nAnd some of these puzzles are extremely tricky.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nI mean, they're just ridiculous.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:31.000\nDo you ever play Myst?\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nOh god, I loved it.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nYou can get all of those too for the iPhone now.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.000\nMyst, Riven, and the seventh guest.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:41.000\nThey're like, yeah, buy them now, they are amazing.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\nAnd it's like the perfect graphics for a third iPhone.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nThey are a little dated, but still.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:49.000\nBut yeah, you can totally get them all.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nSorry, my wife is texting me.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nOh, we thought you were downloading games now.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:56.000\nHow do you know she was texting you from your pocket?\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nDid she have a certain kind of vibrate?\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:02.000\nNo, well...\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nYou pulled your phone out and said my wife was texting me before?\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:08.000\nWell, I didn't know, I brought it out, anybody could have been texting me, but then I saw that it was her.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.000\nShe texted me, Minecraft joke.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:14.000\nQuestion, why did the sailor bring iron and gold into his boat?\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nAnswer, he needed oars.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:21.000\nOh, that's good.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:31.000\nI don't like the direction the show is taking.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:39.000\nIt really has become our generation's Prairie Home companion, including the boredom.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nIt's just me just...\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:45.000\nSarah got her brand new hat.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:48.000\nA blueberry pie.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nWent to church.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:53.000\nIf you're wondering, why would anyone watch this?\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:56.000\nWhich is what Dino asked.\n\n17:56.000 --> 18:01.000\nRight now, Dan, as of two days ago, the community is done.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:04.000\nYeah, yeah, I've rapped on community, I'm done, I'm just editing now.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:08.000\nI was there yesterday at CBS Radford, where you shoot who's Linus anyway.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:12.000\nIt's literally the soundstage directly above where they shoot community.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:17.000\nSo in the hallway where our dressing rooms are, it goes Ryan Stiles, Jeff Winger.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:21.000\nIt's not the actor's names, it's the character names.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:25.000\nIs the character name Ryan Stiles coming up?\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nOr is there a character named Ryan Stiles coming up?\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:28.000\nWell, no, he's a real person.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:29.000\nWell, I knew that.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:32.000\nBut that's why I was thinking it would be a really interesting reference to make.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nA character named Ryan Stiles.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:40.000\nBut sadly, on all the doors for all the community characters, it said vacant, clean room.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:44.000\nAnd I've been there several weeks when it said occupied.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:48.000\nDon't come in here, this is Annie's room, this is Jeff's room, this is Abed's room.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nAnd now, fucking do as you like.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:59.000\nAnd Danny Pudi's like, okay, you can come in, clean it up, and there's just like blood everywhere.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:02.000\nSix dead hitchhikers.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:07.000\nTons of weird tic-tac-toe gamers played in his own poop.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:15.000\nThe Harvey Keitel character that works at Yahoo comes in and looks it over.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:20.000\nAnd they nods to the cleaning crew, cover it up.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nMake it disappear.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nWhat were the numbers last night?\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\n$15 million, sir.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:30.000\nMake it so it didn't happen.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:37.000\nBy the way, everybody in the world watches community, now we know,\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nnow that we're not being measured by Nielsen.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nIs that true?\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:41.000\nYeah.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:44.000\nLike, I probably should have made the season better.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:50.000\nBut it could have been a real double triumph for me to be at my peak,\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:54.000\nas our viewership was, and our support from the other side.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:57.000\nWell, you're finding out that because Nielsen is so flawed,\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nthat more people are watching than you thought?\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nYeah, here's a fundamental way it's flawed.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:06.000\nGuess who wants to fill out a diary of what they watched and sell it to Colgate?\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:09.000\nLike Jay Leno's audience does.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:14.000\nThat is a dying species of television viewer.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:17.000\nAnd then there's this sought after demo called the, what's her?\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nWhat's her?\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:19.000\nWhat are these college kids?\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:20.000\nWhatever you call them.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:24.000\nMillennials, upscales, roamers, sand people.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nI don't know what they're.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:37.000\nBanffas, nerf herders, lobos, tranks.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.000\nBut they don't watch TV yet, TV.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:44.000\nThey certainly, if they do, they're not watching it on a Nielsen box TV.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nOh, surprise, surprise.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:49.000\nYahoo knows how to count the clicks.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:50.000\nGuess what?\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nHoly shit.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nLike, you always knew.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nHow many people?\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\nI can't say.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nWhy not?\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:59.000\nWell, because it's Yahoo's business.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nLike, I don't remember.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:05.000\nIt's their business, like, you know, like, that's their, I don't know.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:10.000\nThey're not necessarily going to, like, publish, you know, like, that was Nielsen's, like, business\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:16.000\nwas, we're this contractor and everyone give us money and then we'll announce your ratings\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nand we'll be, like, this referee.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:18.000\nThat was their business.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:19.000\nNetflix is not doing that.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:23.000\nThey're a private, you know, thing and they go, how many people are watching House of Cards?\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nFuck you.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:27.000\nDo you think House of Cards is a good show?\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nDo you feel like everyone's watching it?\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nYes or no?\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:31.000\nLike, stick it.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:32.000\nYou know, there's no commercial.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:37.000\nSo with Yahoo, though, they have to tell advertisers, obviously, so they have data and they're just,\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:41.000\nI'm not really asking and they're not telling, but they're, you know, lips were loose at the\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\ndrunken rat party.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:47.000\nEnough for me to go, holy shit, that's what I always would have guessed.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:50.000\nTimes two or three.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:58.000\nI always knew there was, like, way more people watching this shit than whatever that.9 represented.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:01.000\nAre you saying that NBC and Sony didn't know that or didn't care?\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:05.000\nI think that the dirty little, I think that the last 10 years it's been a dirty little\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:09.000\nsecret that the Nielsen's has had a totally effective tabulation of viewership.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:14.000\nOver time, we've gotten caught in this cycle where the whole point of the Nielsen system is advertising.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:17.000\nSo if they're not watching commercials, who cares if they're watching?\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:22.000\nBut the creatives, all the creatives want is for numbers of people to watch their show.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nThat's how you measure their success.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:28.000\nAnd so now we're in this weird, you know, flux period where it's like, okay, live plus seven day,\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:29.000\nlive plus 30 day.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:33.000\nYahoo doesn't even fucking, like, they're like, live plus 30 day.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nWho gives a shit?\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:40.000\nLike, Yahoo knows more information than the CIA about, like, viewership.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nThey're on the internet.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:47.000\nThey know, they just have, like, clouds and bell curves and things.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:55.000\nLike, they're like, here's the amount of people that are emotionally moved to purchase things\n\n22:55.000 --> 23:00.000\nby looking at one of Alison Brie's feet, you know, like, they don't, like,\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:06.000\nthey're not worried about views and, like, the week of and the night of and the month of.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nWhat do you think people purchase when they look at one of her feet?\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nIt's probably like a boot or something.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\nI don't know.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nI don't know.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nLook at that foot.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:16.000\nI need a boot.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:19.000\nI was just using the classic example.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:26.000\nKumail tweeted at one point, he said, his goal is to become so successful that one of the Google auto fill ins\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nis Kumail Nanjiani feet.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:32.000\nIt's like a typical thing for female celebrities.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nHow you doing?\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nAre you bursting into flame or anything?\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:36.000\nAll right.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:37.000\nWe got some things to talk about.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:41.000\nSo, yeah, I'm successful.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:45.000\nSo, will there be a season seven or is that it?\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:46.000\nIs community done?\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:47.000\nI don't know, man.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:48.000\nWhat do you want?\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:49.000\nAre you allowed to say?\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:52.000\nI mean, I got to talk to my therapist about this.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nI really don't know.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nDan, pretend I'm your therapist right now.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:57.000\nPretend no one's listening.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nDan, put your phone down.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nI want to put your phone down.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nI want to play Minecraft.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nNo, you don't.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nDan, I know you want to play Minecraft.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nAnd I know that if you had your way, you would only play Minecraft.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:15.000\nBut let's say there was a clamor and a great gnashing of teeth and wailing for another season of community by anybody,\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:18.000\neither by Yahoo or by the fans or whatever.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:21.000\nWould you say yes under certain circumstances?\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:24.000\nI can't tell you right now because I'm just coming off of it.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nYeah, because you have bubble throat?\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:31.000\nNo, I have liquid mouth.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:34.000\nI can't say.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nThat's a perfectly normal thing.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nI drank.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:41.000\nDan, answer a question right now.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:46.000\nI can't talk to her now because I swallowed a little bit of liquid in my mouth.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nOr an ice cube.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.000\nIt's normal.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:52.000\nIt's not to be mocked.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:57.000\nDan, as your therapist, I think you're kind of evading the question right now.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:00.000\nUnder certain circumstances.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nThere's so many variables.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:05.000\nCan you imagine a circumstance where you would say yes to doing this?\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:06.000\nYes, of course.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:10.000\nI can imagine a circumstance where Hitler and I would hang out.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:17.000\nIt involves him hating Jews less and coming back to life and maybe being on a timeline\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:21.000\nwhere he didn't kill a bunch of people and having a full mustache.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nThere's a certain point where he's not Hitler anymore.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:30.000\nHe's just Sam Elliott.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:37.000\nAnd Jeff, how would it go if Sam Elliott was in charge of the Third Reich?\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:48.000\nYou know the Jews are a bunch of assholes.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:52.000\nThe Jews abide.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:58.000\nThe Jews abide.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:02.000\nYeah, so very popular television show.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nVery popular.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nDo you think it's going to come back?\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nIt doesn't.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:12.000\nOkay, look, in no necessary order, let me throw some fucking variables at you.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nDoes Alison Brie want to do?\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nI don't know if the answer to any question you're about to ask.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:20.000\nWhat does her left foot want to do?\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nThe actor contracts her up.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nThat is a big deal.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:27.000\nOkay, so let's say ratings are good.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:32.000\nYahoo goes, hey, Dan, you want to try to marshal the troops and bring it back?\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:35.000\nDo you say fuck that shit, we're done?\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nOr do you say let's see what the actors think?\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nWell, I would say let's see what the actors think.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:40.000\nThere's my answer.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:41.000\nLet's start from there.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:44.000\nBut a million things have to be different.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:49.000\nI have to get my head out of my ass and learn how to run a show.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\nYou're never going to learn how to run a show.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:54.000\nYou've proven that this is the way that you run a show, right?\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nYou run the show the way that you run shows.\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nBut then nobody good will work for me.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nWe had such a great crew this year.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nOur new DP buzz is so good.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nI would work for you, Dan.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:08.000\nThis is your first year, though.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:12.000\nSee, then I'd have that energy and I wouldn't hate you.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:16.000\nDid you say that you pissed off Ronda the proper lady or she's on your team?\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:17.000\nIt's always hard.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:22.000\nIt's hard to work for me because the scripts come in last minute.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:26.000\nAnd so if you're the person that makes the pants,\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:32.000\nthen you're like, I can't make good pants now because I just saw that this person's wearing pants.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:36.000\nIf I had known they were wearing pants a week ago, I could have made the best pants ever.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nI like working the way that I work,\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:42.000\nbut I'm not bringing out the best in the people that work for me.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:48.000\nThey don't get a chance to look at a script and like, hmm, pants, huh?\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nI've got an idea.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:55.000\nThey just have to be like, here's some pants.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nYou know that's called the wardrobe department, right?\n\n27:57.000 --> 28:02.000\nYeah, the pants people.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\nThey really are the people at the wrap party at the end of the year that are always like,\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.000\nthey have like that serious drama about them.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:13.000\nFor all the hell I put everyone through, it's always the wardrobe people that are like,\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:19.000\nYou challenge me.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:22.000\nAnd I like the results.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:27.000\nAnd I just want to go, come on, you make pants.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nTake it easy.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nIt's just pants.\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:36.000\nWorst case scenario, there's a bunch of naked, beautiful people on TV.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:40.000\nEveryone wants that anyway.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:44.000\nAnd they also come with their own clothes.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:47.000\nBut they couldn't pull off a purple fucking cardigan?\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:53.000\nWell, it's not rag on them too much. There's only so many wardrobe people in the city, you know?\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:58.000\nBut yeah, our production designer, our prop master, our wardrobe supervisor,\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:01.000\nthey've been, they're old veterans of the Harmon effect.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:05.000\nAnd they're some great ladies. They're real heroes.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:09.000\nI forgot my shoes last night, right before getting dressed for Who's Line,\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nI was taping the Who's Lines anyway.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:14.000\nAnd getting dressed, I look in my bag, I forgot my shoes at home.\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:17.000\nAnd I go to the wardrobe, people's like, I got no shoes.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:22.000\nAnd they ran to Marshall's and bought me some shoes that were a good size too small.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:26.000\nAnd so I sent a PA to my place and he got stuck in traffic.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:31.000\nSo for the first two hours of a four hour taping, really small shoes.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:34.000\nAnd then I kept playing Jar Jar Binks in a game.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:38.000\nAnd Wayne Brady kept coming and cutting my throat because he hates Jar Jar Binks.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:42.000\nThat's a brave choice.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:45.000\nTo kill Jar Jar to play Jar Jar.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:49.000\nTo kill him, to be anti Jar Jar at an improv scene.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:52.000\nBut I broke a cufflink, so I had small shoes and one cufflink on it.\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nIt was a rough night for me.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nFists with your toes.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:59.000\nFists with your toes?\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:04.000\nSo Dan, I have to say this.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:09.000\nThere's you when you're working and you're in your manic, like, shit to get done mode.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:14.000\nAnd then there's you when you're not working and you're seated the entire show.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:17.000\nThis is the first time you've been seated this long.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:21.000\nWait, are you sitting because you're trying to be sensitive to me?\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:24.000\nNo, I actually love sitting.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:29.000\nIt doesn't matter if the guest is able to run laps around the stage.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:32.000\nYou thought that would make me feel comfortable.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nI'm one of you. I'm sitting.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nI can sit.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:42.000\nI had a girlfriend once who I swear to God.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:46.000\nSuspender disbelief, everybody.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:49.000\nShe told me about a show she was in.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nShe used to perform for these.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:59.000\nThere was this guy that had somehow stumbled into the kind of like goldmine of writing special shows for school kids.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:03.000\nI think I've maybe talked about this in the podcast before, but like she was in a couple of his shows.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:07.000\nSo like he would write these like educational shows and there would be like musicals.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:15.000\nAnd one of them that he wrote was for it was like to now this is where the language gets difficult because what is the point is to raise awareness.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:18.000\nIs it to comfort? Is it to benefit?\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:32.000\nBut it just has that he just had that specialness vibe on it because there was like this show he wrote that was about a kid in a wheelchair who goes to a magical land where everyone is a car.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:48.000\nAnd the insinuation is like, I had so many questions, I was like, so is the idea, does the kid come back and be like, now I feel better?\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:53.000\nShe's like, no, he stays there, but he's happier because everyone else has wheels.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:59.000\nAnd I'm like, that's not, does anyone check this guy's license to write for children?\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:04.000\nBut it's just like the kids in a wheelchair that he gets transported to heaven, to car world.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:07.000\nAnd then the cars are like, they have these car songs.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:12.000\nAnd she would shoot because she had a couple of them memorized and was like, everyone, he's doing the traffic jam.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:17.000\nDo the traffic jam.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:24.000\nI was so intrigued by this guy and his career.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:28.000\nYeah, they just, we have wheels too.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:37.000\nAnyways, that made me think of that, the idea that I would be sitting for your benefit to help you out like a magical car.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:40.000\nThank you, I was getting really jealous.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:43.000\nAre we finding out that you brought Annie up just so you could sit down?\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:47.000\nI often bring guest ups just so I could sit down because when the guests come up, I can't stand there.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:50.000\nSo yes, I often bring people up so I can sit down.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:55.000\nAnnie I brought up so that she could verify that I'm like the world's greatest showrunner.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:56.000\nTotally amazing.\n\n32:56.000 --> 33:01.000\nI turned wardrobe department over to her and the result was an almost purple sweater.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nBut I really almost got it done people.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nWe almost got it done.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:07.000\nIt's just the headlines, you know, tomorrow.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nTMZ, Dan helps Annie.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nAll right.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nAre we going to get more sit down rapper?\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nI thought that was the funniest thing ever.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:20.000\nLazy sit down rapper.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:23.000\nI loved the smattering of applause I got were videos.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nWhy would you even bring that up?\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nI wanted to sus three something.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:31.000\nI blocked Adam Goldberg on Twitter.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nAnd I can't really remember why.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nI just know that I did.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:38.000\nI know why I did.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:42.000\nI don't know if anybody, if it's possible, like you all have your phones in the audience.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:47.000\nLike if somebody can pull up like a timeline and look at like, because I was hashtag when I blocked somebody.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:51.000\nI hashtag at Harmon Black 2015.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:56.000\nAnd so if you look, I don't know if you can find the what he said right before I did that.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:59.000\nI'm so curious like what he did wrong.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:03.000\nWas it because he said one thing or because it was too many things in a row?\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:07.000\nNo, it was like, it was like, it was just, I wasn't, I was in the wrong mood at the wrong time.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:12.000\nLike I said something like, I was in a certain zone and like said something.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:16.000\nAnd then he, he was like snarky and dot connected about it.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:21.000\nAnd I was just like, fuck you, you fucking jackass.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:24.000\nIt's like, elaborate on why millennials are eight years old.\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:25.000\nOh, okay, yeah.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:26.000\nIt's just like, elaborate.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:27.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:28.000\nNo, I, yeah, okay.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:29.000\nSo I was just in a pissy mood.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:32.000\nI tweeted like an anti-millennial tweet.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nI said, remember when millennials were eight years old?\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:37.000\nAnd we said, there are the future and now it's the future.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:40.000\nAnd sure enough, we're all fucking eight years old.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:43.000\nAnd then he, I don't know what he said.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:46.000\nHe said like, well, can you elaborate on that?\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nAnd I said, fuck you.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:54.000\nI said, can you, can you, can you, can you live without a source of something to react to?\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:55.000\nFuck you.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nHarmon block.\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:00.000\nWait, you have a hashtag for blocking people?\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:01.000\nSorry, what?\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:04.000\nFeel free to exist as a collection of reactions.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:05.000\nOh, that's what I said to him.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nFeel free to exist as a collection of reactions.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:08.000\nWow.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:09.000\nDid you look that up right now?\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:13.000\nYeah, a medicine.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:14.000\nOh, she looked it up.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:16.000\nThat's better.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nThank you.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:22.000\nI actually heard two different people called me to tell me about hashtag Harmon block 2015.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:30.000\nThey're like, Dan's blocking all these people and like literally trying to talk to me as though this is like gossip that is necessary in life.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:31.000\nWhat are you taking right now, Dan?\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:32.000\nWhat is this?\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:33.000\nI got the ADD real bad.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:45.000\nSteady as a rock.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:48.000\nBut he shoots at this hand.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:49.000\nTotally legal.\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:50.000\nGot a prescription.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:54.000\nGot the ADD real bad.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nDoes it get you high?\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:57.000\nNo.\n\n35:57.000 --> 36:01.000\nActually, now I'm taking it, like remember when they warned you in the after school specials?\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:04.000\nAnd after a while, you're taking it just to stay normal.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:10.000\nYeah, that's me because I was like, I was taking it to like stay awake and finish writing.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:19.000\nAnd now as a, so now I wake up and like, because I have to taper off of it because it's like, otherwise my eyelids are like anvils.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:22.000\nLike it's, it's, it's, it's exactly what you would think.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:30.000\nIt's just a cartoonish inversion of what you get from the pill is like the year if you're coming off of it, it's like, holy shit.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:33.000\nI'm really tired and super able to focus.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:34.000\nWait, no.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:35.000\nWhat do I take it for?\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:36.000\nFocusing.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nSuper unable to focus.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:43.000\nSomething about focus.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:46.000\nAnnie, why one N?\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:52.000\nWell, I know, I know it's the question that's been on everybody's mind.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:57.000\nActually, so it's a, it's short for my legal name.\n\n36:57.000 --> 37:11.000\nMy name ends in ANI and at some point my friends and I thought it was clever for me to go by Annie and like for all those girls in the world whose name ends with ANI or ANY, you know, the Tiffany's, the Brittany's, the all the Stephanie.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:12.000\nAre you Stephanie?\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:13.000\nWhat are you?\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nWhich, which one do you think I am?\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:16.000\nYou're a Stephanie all the way.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:17.000\nI am not a Stephanie.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:18.000\nI am a Brittany.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nI was going to guess a Brittany.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:25.000\nYeah, but I, but I, so I always hated it and I was like, and I was also really into the Anne of Green Gables books.\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:30.000\nSo I was like, well, Annie is kind of like Anne and I can be that kind of dork.\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:33.000\nSo it was a dance.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:39.000\nWhy one N?\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:44.000\nJust seem like a good place to stop, bro.\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nYeah.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:47.000\nAll right.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:51.000\nWell, I don't, I don't want you cooking up here and I got to, I'm going to, I'm going to bring out more people, I think.\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:56.000\nYou want to give a hand for Annie and she need help getting down.\n\n37:56.000 --> 38:05.000\nAll right.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:12.000\nNow that she's gone, I can stand up again.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:14.000\nYou trying to mock Annie by standing up the horse in the shot?\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:15.000\nI don't know.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nI just feel like this is what I've always done.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:24.000\nWhen somebody comes up, I sit down and somebody's not up here, I stand up.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:29.000\nI thought maybe it would give me a little boost of energy because God knows that medicine won't kick in until midnight.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nIt takes a while to kick in.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:32.000\nYeah.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:34.000\nDo you feel like kicking in?\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:35.000\nNot, not these days.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:39.000\nI can't take that wrong because when I do it, it's like doing just a bag of Coke.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:45.000\nI once took one at 7pm and I was wallpapering my apartment at 4am.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:50.000\nI'm like, I got, I got shit to do.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:54.000\nIf you've never taken it and you, and you take that, that's the effect.\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:57.000\nOr if you don't take it for a really long time, then that's the, that is the effect.\n\n38:57.000 --> 39:03.000\nAnd I believe, I always assumed like that, if that, if it's having that effect on you, that means you don't have ADD.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:04.000\nRight.\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:05.000\nCorrect.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:09.000\nBut my friend has ADD, she takes it and her memory comes back.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:10.000\nRight.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nAnd she also goes to bed at 9pm or 10pm.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:16.000\nYeah. But as I started taking it more, like, like, because I got a real prescription.\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\nSo I was like, okay, now I'm taking it.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:24.000\nI did, it did even out and I did feel, as I said, like, I felt like there were positive effects that had nothing to do with staying awake.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:29.000\nAnd, and, you know, Spencer's, Spencer's kind of convinced that I, that I have ADD.\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:36.000\nBut, you know, that's just coming from his expertise as a dungeon master.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:38.000\nShould we bring him out and talk to him about my ADD?\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:44.000\nSpencer Crittenden.\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:53.000\nT. H. D.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:58.000\nHey guys, how's everybody doing?\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nThat's good.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:06.000\nSpencer, what do you base your findings that Dan might have, ADHD or ADD?\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:09.000\nIt's funny, I just like, was missing my cue.\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:14.000\nI almost didn't come in because I was just explaining to DeMorge the answer to this very question.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:20.000\nIt's just, I mean, I don't know, it's, it's hard to explain, but my little brother is really ADD.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:24.000\nAnd apparently I'm pretty ADD according to doctors and stuff.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:27.000\nI don't know if anyone buys that, but.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:28.000\nSo I mean, I kind of know.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:29.000\nMy doctor was.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:32.000\nYeah.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:35.000\nJust according to your doctor, we all have ADD.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:36.000\nBut I've seen.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:37.000\nAnd glaucoma.\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:42.000\nI've, I've seen.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:43.000\nWell, that's my doctor.\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:46.000\nThose are two totally different doctors on my side.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nBut no, I work with the guy.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:51.000\nI see his, his behavior, his antics at work.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:56.000\nAnd it's just, it's very, to me, it just seems like a guy who has ADD.\n\n40:56.000 --> 41:00.000\nYou know, no offense, Dan, you do great work, but just your mannerisms.\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:07.000\nThey seem very deficit in terms of attention.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nWhat do you, what do you think?\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:12.000\nWhat do you, what do you, what's your view of this season?\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:16.000\nLike, like, like, do you have any, any, like, like people are probably curious.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:18.000\nLike what, what happened?\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:21.000\nYou know, you're sitting in, sitting there the whole time.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:22.000\nWhat happened?\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:23.000\nYeah.\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:24.000\nI don't know.\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:30.000\nYou have any interesting insights about, about my work?\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:32.000\nNo, I mean, I don't know.\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:34.000\nIt's, it's, I feel like people say it.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:37.000\nIt's just like, it's, it's all, it's all coming from you.\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:41.000\nI mean, obviously the writers do great work, but at the end of the day,\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:46.000\neverything that is on screen has happened because of something in your brain.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:53.000\nAnd as such, you know, it's, it's lame to give the other writers credit.\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:57.000\nSpencer, what is your day-to-day task at the show?\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:58.000\nOkay.\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:03.000\nSo I get in, usually Dan's still asleep or he's ambiguously in his office,\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:04.000\npotentially asleep.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nSo I don't want to bother him.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:07.000\nWhat time of day are we talking?\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:10.000\nYou know, anywhere from 7 a.m. to 9 30.\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:13.000\nIt depends on, you know, the night before.\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:18.000\nAnd when I, when I determine that he is in fact awake, I try and ask him what he,\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:22.000\nwhat he needs, what he needs, if he needs coffee or food or something.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:30.000\nAnd then I, I go do that and I sit around and I basically repeat that routine for,\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\nyou know, the whole time.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:33.000\nIt's great.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:36.000\nAnd other than that, I'm just sitting around and listening and observing.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nAre you in the writer's room?\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:40.000\nNot so much this season.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:43.000\nIt was a, it was a hot office and there wasn't as many chairs.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:48.000\nI would sit, my room is right outside the office and the walls were like paper thin\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:51.000\nso I could hear everything at all times.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nAnd, yeah.\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:59.000\nDo you feel like, do you have ambitions to like write your own stuff and like maybe\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:00.000\nhave a show of your own?\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:01.000\nYeah, definitely.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:04.000\nI just don't think I am like good at anything.\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:06.000\nSo I don't know how I could do it.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:10.000\nDo you feel like your time listening through the walls like community might have prepared\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:11.000\nyou in some way?\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:12.000\nHave you learned stuff?\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:13.000\nCertainly.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:16.000\nI think knowing how a writer's room works is a skill.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:19.000\nI don't know if it's something that they're going to like look at and be like, oh, we\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\ngot to get this guy.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:27.000\nBut I think that it's certainly something that does actually help because you have an expectation\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:31.000\nand you kind of understand the packing order and just the workflow and how things go.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:34.000\nSo, I mean, I think it's valuable for that reason.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:38.000\nAlso, you know, you learn about writing.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nAre you writing your own stuff?\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:41.000\nNo.\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:45.000\nI've written a couple things but I got off the wagon.\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nAre you one of those types?\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:48.000\nI'm not.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:51.000\nI'm one of those writers and the reason why I'm not a stand up or a writer is because\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nI don't think of comedy in terms of jokes.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:56.000\nLike stand up friends of mine, they get up and they write jokes and they want to get\n\n43:56.000 --> 44:01.000\nup and do material and writers wake up in the morning and go, I have to make a show about\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:04.000\na guy that does this thing or a girl that does this thing.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nI don't think in terms of ideas like that.\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:07.000\nAre you one of those people?\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nDo you think of premises?\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:15.000\nI think of ideas in terms of like traps and monsters usually.\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:22.000\nSo, it's kind of, it takes some creative work to turn that into like a script or a joke.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nAre you a story kind of guy?\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:28.000\nI mean, obviously, we know that you're good at like character and character development\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:31.000\nand creation and certainly trap development.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:36.000\nI guess you'd say, I guess you'd say I'm more of a world builder in all honesty,\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:41.000\nlike I'll think about things and then it's like, oh yeah, and the pizza story goes at,\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:46.000\nit has this guy and he has a mom that he's paying for cancer or something.\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:50.000\nWhat does he pay for cancer?\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nOther people get it for free.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:57.000\nNo, but so just, you know, world building.\n\n44:57.000 --> 45:00.000\nIt's really throwing your money away.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nIt's paying for kids.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:05.000\nBut so that's usually how my mind goes.\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:08.000\nI could see you like writing a show because you're very gifted,\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:12.000\nbut I could also see you having like, you know, there's these myth buster guys.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nI like that show.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:19.000\nI watch myth busters, but I would watch a show where Spencer like is busting traps or I don't know.\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nBusting traps?\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:24.000\nJust trying to thwart his ventures.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nTrap sensors.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:29.000\nIt would be interesting to have a show just like kind of a,\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nI don't know how you do it without hurting people,\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:35.000\nbut like the idea of like just traps, like people traps,\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:39.000\nlike I don't know, just doing weird shit to people.\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nThe new challenge rooms.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nI would say this, Dan, if you were going to make that show,\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nif you were the head of a network and you came to me,\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nthe junior head of the network and said,\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:51.000\nis there a way to do a show without hurting people or just traps?\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nAnd people are trying to evade traps.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nAnd maybe some people get caught in traps.\n\n45:55.000 --> 46:01.000\nI would say, well, the first thing I know is we got to get Spencer Crittenden on this thing.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:05.000\nThey have these like things that you can go to,\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nyou know, like those games we were talking about,\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:10.000\nmissed, you know, and they have those games on the iPad.\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nEscape the room.\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:13.000\nThe room, yeah.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nLike escape the room is the name of the genre.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:16.000\nSomething like that.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:20.000\nLike they have live action, escape the room like events\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:23.000\nthat you can buy a ticket to and go to and you're like in a room\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:26.000\nand there's like a guy chained up like a zombie\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:30.000\nand the chain is getting gradually longer, I guess.\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:31.000\nYeah.\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:34.000\nAnd then you have to like figure out like these kind of like esoteric puzzles and things.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:37.000\nI don't think I would enjoy that.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:38.000\nIt's fun.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:39.000\nIt's fun.\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:40.000\nWell, I'm trying.\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:41.000\nIt's not fun.\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:42.000\nIt's horrible.\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nDid you went and did one?\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:47.000\nCan you come and talk to us about it?\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:48.000\nWait, are you willing to come up here?\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:49.000\nYou don't have to.\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:50.000\nNo.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:51.000\nOkay, come on up.\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:52.000\nI just want to hear it.\n\n46:52.000 --> 47:03.000\nHe's got shiny pants and a shiny necklace.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:08.000\nHello, what's your name?\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:09.000\nJenny.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:10.000\nJenny?\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:11.000\nWith a G.I.N. and Y?\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nGrab that mic next to you.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:14.000\nHi.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:15.000\nHello, Jenny.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:19.000\nDoes it bum you guys out when I switch mics like that back there?\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:20.000\nNo.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:21.000\nOkay.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:22.000\nThey're pros.\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:23.000\nSparkle pants.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:24.000\nJenny?\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:25.000\nOkay.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:31.000\nSo you went to one of these live action puzzle game things.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:32.000\nI did.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:35.000\nAnd it was a horrible idea because I took mushrooms first.\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:36.000\nOh boy.\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:39.000\nThis is not the vendor's fault.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:43.000\nBut just to let like a tiny little bit of that.\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:49.000\nThat's like, I have no idea if Wicked is a good player or not.\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nMake sure your eyeballs wiggle.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:54.000\nIt's teeth grinding leave.\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nWonderful.\n\n47:56.000 --> 48:00.000\nOkay, but continue.\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nSo there's this building in New York.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:08.000\nI'm from New York, but you go in and it's a bunch of goofy actors.\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nWe're familiar with New York.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:11.000\nWhat show did you see?\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nIt was called...\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:17.000\nNice, Dan.\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:26.000\nDan's doing the world's longest least merited camera take.\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:30.000\nIt doesn't even make sense because we're in LA.\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nYeah, I mean, way more so.\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:34.000\nI mean, there's nothing but actors here.\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:37.000\nNew York has a couple of people who are selling fish.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:38.000\nWhat was the show called again?\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:39.000\nIt's called The Room.\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:42.000\nAnd it's just like a big building and you go through all the rooms.\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\nAnd are you with a group of people?\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nYeah, and you have to try to figure it out.\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:47.000\nAs a group?\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:48.000\nYeah.\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:49.000\nYou're talking it out with each other?\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:50.000\nYeah, it's just really...\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:55.000\nThere's a bunch of people that are pretending to give you a hard time, but...\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:58.000\nLike there are paid performers that are like,\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:01.000\nLook, it's not even my idea to be here.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:04.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:08.000\nSo it's people like me that have to deal with this.\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:11.000\nI'm not going to say what race that guy is.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:15.000\nBut he's wearing a flannel shirt with a thermal shirt underneath it.\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\nAnd he's like salt of the earth.\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:20.000\nLike reminding you that you're privileged and like...\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:24.000\nThat's the first character I'd want to write for one of the six.\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nYou would probably come up with a better one then.\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:27.000\nI would.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:28.000\nOf course I would.\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:29.000\nYeah.\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:32.000\nI got excited about it.\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:37.000\nLike Aaron told me about a thing where you pay...\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:42.000\nAnd then it's like a Halloween horror thing where you pay and then you go...\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:45.000\nAnd it's like a tour...\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:48.000\nGod, what am I doing?\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:51.000\nI don't know how to talk.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\nI thought Adderall was supposed to help you focus.\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:55.000\nI took that thing minutes ago.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:59.000\nIt's for Minecrafting all night.\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:02.000\nIt'll kick in halfway through an episode of Empire.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:05.000\nWhy not be a professional and take this four hours before the show?\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:06.000\nI forgot.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:10.000\nBecause I'm not focused on anything.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:15.000\nI forgot my Alzheimer's medication.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:19.000\nYou go to a thing and you're...\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:22.000\nIt's like a haunted house.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:25.000\nIt's like a zombie apocalypse.\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:30.000\nBut you're led through this thing by these SWAT team guys who are survivors.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nThey go, come on, get through the door.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:33.000\nCome on, it's closing.\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:36.000\nAnd you're in a bomb shelter kind of situation.\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:41.000\nAnd you run from point to point with these guys that have guns and stuff.\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:44.000\nBut they're performers, but then there's zombies attacking you.\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:49.000\nThat is the only thing I've ever heard of that sounded kind of fun that I would enjoy doing.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nExcept for running.\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:54.000\nJust the idea that there's this kind of...\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:57.000\nIf you combine that with a murder mystery thing where you're like,\n\n50:57.000 --> 51:03.000\noh, I'm Professor Johnson and I need to...\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:07.000\nMore the lawn.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nIf there was a little bit of role playing to it, maybe,\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nand you kind of did it with your friends.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:15.000\nSo you give them $1,000 and you take 80 of your friends.\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:19.000\nYou go in and there's these SWAT team guys that go, come on.\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:23.000\nOkay, so you get dropped off in a shuttle.\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:25.000\nAre we creating a new show right now?\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:28.000\nYeah, and I don't know how much of this that they do,\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nbut when I heard the idea, I got excited about it.\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:34.000\nSo I pictured you get in a shuttle and then you get dropped off of a little beach or something.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:38.000\nAnd then there's like a pretenzies downbeat thing that's going on.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:41.000\nIt's like, happy birthday, Jeff, when you're on a beach.\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:44.000\nAnd you're like, happy birthday, Jeff.\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:48.000\nAnd then there's a zombie attack that's just sort of staged.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:52.000\nThere's a guy who's in your party that is like a red shirt in Star Trek.\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nHe's on the bus with you.\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.000\nAnd it's like, y'all know me. I'm Gail.\n\n51:56.000 --> 52:00.000\nAnd everyone's like, Gail, you fuckface.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:05.000\nAnd then Gail wanders off and he gets attacked horribly by a zombie.\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:07.000\nAnd then we go, oh, shit.\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:11.000\nAnd cops or soldiers come up and go, come on, come on, come on, come on.\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:14.000\nAnd then you take you to a shelter.\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:15.000\nAnd then, I don't know.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:19.000\nThen you have to vote on who to feed to the zombies or something.\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nThis is very similar to my experience.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:22.000\nYeah.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:23.000\nOkay, so yeah, I forgot.\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nWere you hallucinating genetically high?\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nNo, no, no, just like fun high.\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:32.000\nSo you get to this room and then they go like, oh, you got to solve a puzzle.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:35.000\nYeah, and there's like a door in the corner and they expect you to find them.\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:36.000\nAre the easy puzzles a hard puzzle?\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:41.000\nYeah, is it like the room challenge where it's like, uh-oh, there's a doormat.\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:44.000\nThere's like a key taped to the bottom of a drawer.\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:48.000\nYeah, so it actually is just physical kind of perceptiveness.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:49.000\nYeah.\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:50.000\nInteresting.\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:54.000\nIt's a real live version of a point and click thing\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:57.000\nwhere you just like run your cursor over everything.\n\n52:57.000 --> 53:02.000\nJust like run, drag your hand across the room until a shingle turns around.\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:06.000\nSo I was like the smartest person in my group.\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:09.000\nThen I'm like, there's a box on the top of the dresser that has a key in it.\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:12.000\nAnd it's got like, we have to reset the clock.\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:15.000\nAnd then the clock makes another key come out.\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.000\nStupid.\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:18.000\nExactly.\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:19.000\nAll right, Ginny, is Ginny?\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:20.000\nGinny, yeah.\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nSparklepants, Ginny.\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:23.000\nSparklepants.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:27.000\nHigh on mushrooms all the time.\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:30.000\nHas a major drug problem.\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:33.000\nSparklepants.\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nNeeds an intervention.\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:36.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:37.000\nGinny.\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:41.000\nI went to a show with a dean I told me to go to in New York called Sleep No More.\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:42.000\nHave you guys been to that?\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:43.000\nYeah.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:44.000\nThat's Macbeth.\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:47.000\nYou go into a big hotel and it's a 20s jazz club and you walk in\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:50.000\nand you get split up from your people and you put a mask on.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:53.000\nAnd you walk through rooms and you're encouraged to go snoop through drawers\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nand look around and read stuff.\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:58.000\nAnd for the first 45 minutes, nothing was going on.\n\n53:58.000 --> 53:59.000\nIt was like, this sucks.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nAnd then you would hear some commotion.\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nAnd you start snooping around and following stuff.\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nAnd then you start watching Hamlet be played out.\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:08.000\nBut also, it's just like, you're just in rooms and you watch a murder.\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:10.000\nThen everyone gets naked and they're just dancing around.\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nIt's great.\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nYeah.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:17.000\nEverywhere you go, that happens.\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:20.000\nIt's like a McDonald's.\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:23.000\nThat's not going to happen to any of us.\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:26.000\nWell, not with that attitude.\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:31.000\nSo Aaron is at home right now because the Nigel, the grief dog, the new dog,\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:35.000\nhe ate a pile of Harvey's hair.\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:38.000\nAnd so first of all, pause.\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nWhy is there a pile of Harvey's hair?\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:41.000\nBecause it's summertime.\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nWe're starting to give him a little haircut.\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:44.000\nSo Aaron gave him a little haircut.\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:47.000\nSo there's a pile of shaved hair from Harvey.\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nDogs eat hair?\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:52.000\nGrief dogs.\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nSo Nigel ate Harvey's hair.\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:58.000\nAnd then his poops have ropes coming out of him.\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:04.000\nAnd Aaron has to pull them.\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:10.000\nLike he's a British Christmas popper.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:15.000\nBut there's no, you don't get a whistle, you don't get anything.\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:20.000\nI had a dog one time that ate an insole of a shoe,\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\nlike a foam shoe liner insole.\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:25.000\nAnd it came out like a perfectly spiraled poop shape.\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:30.000\nIt just went straight through this dog's body and came out as a shoe liner.\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:32.000\nIt was amazing.\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:36.000\nI'm wearing it right now.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:41.000\nI can't figure the dogs that are among us, like they're the descendants of the dogs\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:47.000\nthat mutated the ability to just eat anything and not die, almost.\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:51.000\nExcept Harvey had an incident with a fan's Rice Krispie treat tray.\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:54.000\nI told you guys about that.\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:58.000\nSo Nigel the Grief Dog is pooping hair ropes right now?\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\nYeah.\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:03.000\nAnd Aaron has to physically pull them out of his butt\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:08.000\nbecause it hurts his little, took us to, hurt some to make the poops.\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:12.000\nAnd he's in the middle of getting trained how to poop.\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:15.000\nSo he's like, this is what I'm supposed to do.\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nYou care where I do this? It hurts.\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:20.000\nAnd we're like, yeah, don't do that in the wrong place.\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:26.000\nAnd he's like, it hurts. It's all the wrong place.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:31.000\nI've never heard of a dog eating hair. That's a hungry dog.\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:34.000\nWell, you're not supposed to feed him for the first seven months.\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:36.000\nOh.\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:39.000\nOkay, now there's your problem. There's your problem.\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:43.000\nAlthough I did get my dog training book on eBay and there's a page missing.\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:48.000\nIt's called Don't Feed Your Dog.\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:54.000\nThe way the words break down, it was the equivalent of the six that turns into a nine.\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\nI haven't fed my dog in seven months.\n\n56:56.000 --> 57:06.000\nFart corner.\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:08.000\nI'm all done with that fucking show.\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:12.000\nAre you happy?\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:14.000\nI don't even know. I don't even know.\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:16.000\nIs it a weight off your shoulders?\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:19.000\nOf course it's a weight. It's like the understatement of the year.\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:22.000\nYou seem like you're just kind of neutrally buoyant right now.\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:25.000\nI have no idea who I am, what I'm doing.\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:28.000\nI have no idea what I like. I don't know who likes me.\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:32.000\nI don't know if Chris McKenna hates me or if he loves me. I have no idea.\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:38.000\nI'm not joking. I sense that because, and I'm not saying this to be corny,\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:41.000\nbut I feel like your identity is often what you're working on.\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:43.000\nThat goes for lots of us. Everybody.\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:46.000\nWhen you're working on something, that is a huge part of who you are.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:52.000\nAnd now that that show is over, do you feel like there's a suspension of identity?\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:57.000\nYes. It's called workaholism, which sounds productive,\n\n57:57.000 --> 58:01.000\nbut it can also just be this.\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:06.000\nJust like a slob who only knows who he is by what he does.\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:09.000\nDoes that make you want to throw yourself into Rick and Morty or whatever's next?\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nOr does it make you want to just play Minecraft?\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:15.000\nI'd like to play Minecraft for a little while.\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:21.000\nWhich is me working digitally, so I know who I am by my marble cube.\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:24.000\nYou don't ever picture yourself like, like, fuck it.\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:29.000\nI'm going to go to Centro Pay and sit in a beach and just chill and have a nice...\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nI'm going to go to Barcelona with Aaron.\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:36.000\nThey invited us out for a film festival, television festival kind of thing.\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\nThey're going to treat us real nice.\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:43.000\nIt's kind of a working vacation because I'll do a lot of press in Spanish.\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nI don't speak Spanish.\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\nCatalan.\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:54.000\nOkay, I'll just say that.\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:56.000\nWhat is that?\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:58.000\nThat's a dialect they're speaking in Barcelona.\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:00.000\nI can't call it Spanish.\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:10.000\nIf you speak Spanish, they'll understand you, but they might speak back to you in Catalan.\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:13.000\nDan, here's all you need to know about Barcelona.\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:14.000\nDo you like ham?\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:15.000\nYes.\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nYou're good to go.\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:21.000\nYou cannot be a fucking vegetarian in Barcelona because it's simply ham.\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:24.000\nThey'll put a bit of ham on everything you get.\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:28.000\nI talked to a motherfucker for ten minutes in Spanish about my paella.\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:32.000\nI said, this is the vegetarian paella and it still had sausage and shrimp in it.\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:33.000\nI said, what the fuck is this?\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:34.000\nHe goes, ay, verduras.\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:35.000\nThere's vegetables in it.\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nI'm like, ay, ay, fucking vegetables.\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:41.000\nThere's a shrimp on top of it, on top of the sausage.\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nHe's eating some of your vegetables.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:46.000\nThe shrimp is like, excuse me.\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:47.000\nThey don't take it.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nIf you like ham, you're fucking ready to rock there.\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nAll you have to do is go into a place and say, ham.\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:55.000\nI wonder if anyone really does like ham.\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nDoesn't it seem like this is a dumb meat?\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:58.000\nWho does or does not like ham?\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nWell, just like anyone who's like a fan of ham.\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nIt seems like it's like there.\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nYou're going to go to Barcelona, Jackson, and the whole city is based on ham.\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nYou go into a restaurant and there's just fucking hams hanging in the window.\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nBut that's different.\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nThey're an old world. They love survival.\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nThe Irish love potatoes because it could grow in Ireland.\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nThis is luxury. This is leisure meat.\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nI came to Barcelona for the ham.\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nI can't wait to eat ham.\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nYeah, you do.\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nIt just seems dumb to me.\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nThat's what you fucking do.\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nThat's like licking tile grout or something.\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nIt just seems dumb.\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nIt's a fucking ham joint.\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nI can see somebody liking lamb, beef, chicken.\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nAny other meats?\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nHam?\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nWell, there's hams the fourth one.\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nAnd I just think it's like the early 90s Fox network of meats.\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nIt's just not a contender.\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nThey haven't gotten their Simpsons yet.\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nIt's just garbage.\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nHam just seems like a dumb meat.\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nSalami?\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nWhat is salami?\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nIt's the sausage.\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nIt's just spicy pork.\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nI don't know anything about meat.\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nI'm angry about it.\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nI don't understand what the hell any of this shit is.\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nAll these animals are dying.\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nLook at me.\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nI look like a pig.\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nEvery day I was like, Spencer, go get me a fucking burger.\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nSomewhere there's this assembly line of these sad animals that have IQs higher than some\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nof the people I work with.\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nCalifornia is out of water.\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nWe're out of fucking water here in California.\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nIf you're flying on a plane in the daytime, you're landing in California, look out the\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nwindow and look at all the reservoirs empty.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nThere's no fucking water here.\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nYet we have tons of water to grow alfalfa, which is what we feed cows.\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nIt takes a fucking ton of acres of alfalfa to make a couple pounds of meat.\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nIt's ridiculous.\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000\nIt's completely insane.\n\n01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nAnd then they fart and the cows fart and that's an environmental thing.\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nThe cow farts.\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nDid you hear that?\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nThat's just a fucking bugbear man.\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000\nIt's a bogey.\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nWhat?\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nIt's a mucka muck.\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nIt's a muscle mass.\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nYou're my muscle mass, man.\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nBut I hear tell that the beef is like a big, you know, deforestation.\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nIt's 9-eleven.\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nNice.\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nIt's 9-eleven.\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nIt's 9-eleven.\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nMake a wish.\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nMake a wish.\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nWhat are we doing now?\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nOur new tradition is every week you forget.\n\n01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nBut have we settled on one?\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nI think for this week we make a one-act play about 9-eleven.\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nOkay.\n\n01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nOr no, we make a one-act play about whatever we were just talking about.\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nWell, we do a one-act play set against the backdrop of 9-eleven.\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nOkay.\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nBut it's about something else.\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nOkay.\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nAbout jeans.\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nAbout jeans.\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nNo, don't go there.\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nOkay.\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nThere's an urban legend about firefighters stealing jeans during 9-eleven.\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nIt's not true.\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nStealing jeans?\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nYeah.\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nFrom where?\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nYeah, from the concourse underneath 9-eleven.\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nThere was like, yeah, it's an urban legend.\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nThere's this guy that wrote a book about ground zero.\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000\nThere was this urban legend that developed where they found a fire truck filled with jeans\n\n01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nfrom the gap.\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nAnd it's the most ridiculous urban legend because it's like, can you imagine being a firefighter\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nduring 9-eleven and you're like, boys, you're looking at this the wrong way.\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nIt's just so silly.\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nFor everything that we hold sacred, someone has to create some kind of thing.\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nIt's just like our mind creates mythology.\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nSo there was this notion, it's completely unverifiable that they unearthed in the rubble\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000\na fire truck and it was filled with jeans.\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nAnd I can feel it's clear in the room, but in case it doesn't translate over electronic\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nfibers, we're laughing because 9-eleven's bad and people are good and firefighters are\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000\ngreat and we're not laughing at 9-eleven.\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nBut are firefighters great only because of their weird love of jeans?\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nI mean, it's funny.\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nIt just gets you like, in the Rick and Morty writers room, we were talking about this for\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nthree hours about the firefighters stealing the jeans and we developed a whole movie about\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\na firefighter.\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nWhat was the movie called?\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000\nCan we fade in?\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nCan we see some of that?\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nI know the slogan for the movie was one-size-fits-all.\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nI want to talk about it logistically because the poster, I also remember the poster I drew\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nwas the New York skyline with two legs of jeans that became, oh, oh, oh, and the title,\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nI remember the title.\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nIt became what?\n\n01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nIt became what?\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000\nI don't know exactly.\n\n01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nThe story is about a firefighter who survives 9-eleven with a bunch of jeans and he now goes\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000\naround the country and he gives a pair of pants to each family of a victim of 9-eleven\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nand they magically all fit.\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nIt's like a traveling pants thing in there.\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nThe title of the movie was, I've got to get this right, so, Redenimshin.\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nWe developed a whole movie, we did not work on Rick and Morty for half a day and we were\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000\njust crying, laughing.\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nOf course we're crying, laughing because that's why these things happen.\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nHow did the firefighter acquire all of these jeans?\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nHow did he come across them?\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nThe idea is that there's a concourse underneath the World Trade Center that has all these\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nstores and stuff and they were looting before they really realized the gravity.\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nIt's not true.\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nIt's not a real story.\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nIt was printed in a book by a guy who did not verify the story.\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nHe just kept hearing it, but every person he heard it from was not a verifiable, you\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nknow, it was just urban legend.\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nSo he printed urban legend, so it became like a real urban legend.\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nIt's like, you know, you Google like, or Yahoo, firefighter pants 9-eleven.\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nNice catch.\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nNice catch.\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nIt really is a good search engine.\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nIt's much more than searching.\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nIt's so much more than searching.\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nYou could, without even looking for it, you could find your horoscope.\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000\nYou don't even have to search for that.\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nI bet on Google you have to type, what's my horoscope?\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nYahoo, it's there.\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nAnd they have a whole section called Yahoo Answers.\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nYou ever want to know anything from a 16-year-old who doesn't know anything?\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nYou could just go on there and go, hey, how much does a basketball cost?\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nAnd someone will go like, why are you asking?\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nThey'll see a doctor.\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nIt's a great service.\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:18.000\nYahoo Answers is just a bunch of dingbats at a 250 million-way intersection.\n\n01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nYahoo Answers, because some answers are bad.\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nIs there a slogan?\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nYeah, Redenimchin.\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nSo when the people get the pants and they magically fit.\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nThen they're like, OK, thank you.\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nBut fucked up what you did.\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nAnd he's like, I couldn't have, and they're like, we know.\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nBut still, you should have tried.\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nAnd he's like, OK.\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nShouldn't that guy go, I gave away all the pants.\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nI did what I could.\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nEveryone got pants that was affected by this.\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nThey all fit.\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nAnd he goes back home to Long Island.\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nThere was a family.\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nThere was Staten Island, let's say.\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nAnd he goes back home with his wife and kids.\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nAnd he sits there and they knock on the door.\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nAnd there's an old...\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nThat was my accident.\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nOr was it?\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nThere's a knock on the door.\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nAnd there's an old...\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nI'm picturing the Asian guy from Gremlins,\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nthe guy that gives him the magway.\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nAnd he goes, you know that there's genes.\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nThere's a reason why they were hidden down there\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nin that concourse beneath World Trade Center Tower 1.\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nBecause those genes are cursed.\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nOh, no.\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nAnd then there's going to be...\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nAnd then you pull back and there's towers being built\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000\neverywhere where he gave pants away.\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nYeah.\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nAnd then that music plays.\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nWhat did you...\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nWhat are you shaking your head for?\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nWhat did you expect?\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nI wanted you to launch into one of your famous fade-ins\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000\non fucking, you know, like...\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nThat's the end of the movie.\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nNo, it's the beginning of the second act.\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nWhat?\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000\nIt's the beginning...\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nThe first act, as 9-11 happens,\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nand a firefighter gives away all the pants.\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nYes.\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nAnd at the end of the first act,\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000\na Chinese guy says, those pants cross 9-11.\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nThat's the crossing of the first threshold.\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nAre you Christopher Nolan?\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nYes.\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nThe first threshold.\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nOh, seems like a good movie.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nThat seems like that was enough.\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nHowever, no, no.\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nYou got yourself into a world of fucking...\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nThis is way bigger than jeans.\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nIt's way bigger than 9-11.\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nYou've got three hours of McConaughey\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nand a bookshelf.\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nNo, you gave everybody cursed pants.\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nOh, right, all right.\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nThese are cursed pants.\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nI've not seen the movie you're talking about.\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nYou gotta see this movie.\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nOh, behind the book, guys.\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nOh, there's me.\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nOh, that's when I did that.\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nOh.\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nI'm a little bolder now,\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nbecause since I aired that,\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nmy grievance is about interstellar.\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nA lot of people have come forward\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nand thanked me for my bravery.\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nAnd said, thank you.\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nI can't say it.\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nYou know, I'm a PA.\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nOr a stunt coordinator.\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000\nYou know, someone has to fall off that bookcase.\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nNolan runs this town.\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nThank you.\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nThank you for saying that the movie's a little silly.\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nAnyways, your movie...\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nMy movie is that the movie starts\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nwhen the guy finds out that the pants he gave away,\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nhe thought he was doing a good deed.\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000\nSo at what point in your movie is the guy\n\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000\ngoing from town to town giving pants\n\n01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000\nand having these emotional conversations?\n\n01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nI would call that a road of trials.\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nBut for you, it's just like an ordinary world.\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nNo, no, no, let's make it the...\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000\nThe meeting with the goddess is the Chinese guy saying...\n\n01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nFinding the pants is the top of the circle.\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000\nThe bottom of the circle is like,\n\n01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000\nfinding out what the pants are actually about.\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nWhen you say finding the pants,\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nyou mean looting them from 9-11.\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nRight.\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nSo it fades in on 9-11.\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nYeah, a guy says,\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000\noh, shit, free pants, 9-11.\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nFucking great.\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nThen his wife goes, honey, that's fucking...\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nYou profited.\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nWe have a fire truck.\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nFire truck full of jeans outside.\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nSo we identify with this character,\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nso it fades in and 9-11's happening.\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000\nAnd it catches you, like a certain battalion,\n\n01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000\nand the guy goes like, go, go, go, go.\n\n01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000\nUp to floor 19, up to floor 19.\n\n01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000\nAnd the guy's like, this is just a fire.\n\n01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nIt's going to be fine.\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nOr there's an accident, like the sign.\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000\nIf you really want to identify with a guy,\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000\nlike the sign has to turn upside down,\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nso he goes to the wrong floor.\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nSure.\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000\nSo then he's just surrounded with pants.\n\n01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nThere's jeans, and maybe someone else says,\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nhey, you know, everybody clear out the building.\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nIt's like, it's just a fire.\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nLet's get everybody out of here.\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000\nAnd he goes like, oh, there's fucking jeans in there.\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nRight.\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nTake these jeans.\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nAnd so he goes home and he's got a bunch of jeans.\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000\nBut he gets home, and he goes, I got to get these jeans out of here.\n\n01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nAnd then he realizes all of his friends are dead.\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nAnd he feels guilty about it.\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nSo he goes and gives all those jeans away.\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nI'm going to make my mission to travel to Earth.\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000\nSo it's like, 9-11's the cold open.\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nRight.\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000\nAnd it's like, yeah.\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nSo he runs into it, and he's like, I think you need,\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nlike you'd have to do it in flashback,\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nwhich is kind of cheating,\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nbut you have to establish that this guy,\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nlike you're Turk 182.\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000\nLike the idea that being a firefighter is like,\n\n01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nthe city fucks you over.\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nLike the guy is like, his dad has dementia,\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nor his brother, well, just rip off Turk 182\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nand say his brother got hurt really bad\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nbeing a firefighter, and they didn't give him compensation.\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000\nRight.\n\n01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.000\nSo like, he's going to 9-11, like half predisposed.\n\n01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nHe's primed.\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nHe's like, this is my last day as a firefighter.\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nAnd then they're like, they're like,\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nmismanaging 9-11 somehow in a civic sense.\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nGo up a holding pattern, Roger that.\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nYou kind of look at the bureaucratic side of it.\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000\nYou're like disillusioned.\n\n01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nYou're like, it's a disaster.\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nAnd I know, I know the big picture of this.\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nBut from his perspective, it's like, this is ridiculous.\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nLike, what is my job?\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nHow do I know when I'm helping people or whatever?\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nAnd then he just goes through this door,\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000\nbecause he's like, I'm going to try.\n\n01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nAnd he gets yelled at.\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nHe's like, his boss goes like, Henderson, what are you doing?\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nHe's like, I'm trying to save people, sir.\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nHe's like, I don't pay you to save people.\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nGo in that room and cool off.\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nGo in that room until you know what's important.\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nAnd he goes in the room and it's like a closed down gap.\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nAnd he's like, and he looks up and it's like denim gold.\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nYeah.\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nAnd the fluorescent lights are flickering\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nand it's just jeans everywhere.\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000\nYeah.\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nAnd it's like the camera kind of pushes on him.\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nAs you hear, like, black, red denim shirt.\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nAnd then it fades up and it's like his dementia,\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000\nat old father is like being fed soup by his mom\n\n01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000\nwhen they're watching like all the coverage of the disaster\n\n01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000\nlike a week later.\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nAnd his brother is like all burnt up in the corner going like,\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nwhen I, good thing I didn't have to go to 9-11.\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nAnd he's like, yeah, but you get fucked up too.\n\n01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nAnd they fucked you over.\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nAnd then he's like, how come you, how come you survived 9-11?\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nAnd he's like, I told you, they made me go in a room\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nand they're like, well, whatever.\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nAnd then he's like, okay, I'm going to go downstairs\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000\nand think about

jeans.\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000\nThey don't fit.\n\n01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nAnd the guy says, what?\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nOur hero says.\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nHe says like, huh, maybe because it's the last pair.\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nAnd then the kid's like, yeah, I don't know.\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000\nBut they're like kind of baggy.\n\n01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nAnd he's like, maybe I like these.\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nMaybe those jeans were in the fire truck already.\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000\nMaybe those are.\n\n01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nMaybe they're my pants.\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nYeah.\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000\nI don't

know.\n\n01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nThe kid stays in the picture, dad.\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nBut he, so he's at home.\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nIt's page 16.\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nHe's eating pancakes.\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nDementia dad died while he was gone.\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000\nThe burnt brother is like, like, still burnt.\n\n01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nAnd like, still like, why are you here?\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nHow did you survive 911?\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000\nIt's so fucked up.\n\n01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nAnd, and then I'm just going with your.\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000\nSo there's a knock on the door.\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nIt's an old Chinese man says like those pants were under 911 for a reason.\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nThey're cursed.\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000\nThey caused 911.\n\n01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nThis is your idea now.\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nNo.\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nOkay.\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000\nOh, well, okay.\n\n01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nWell, I their cursed was your idea.\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000\nRight.\n\n01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nI'm saying that there's a reason like, like you find out that he puts these pants on people.\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nBut that, uh, that comes at a, like that's just too good to be true.\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nThere's a reason why they fit everybody.\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000\nHe has to go get them all back.\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nNo.\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nI think all those people, like, like they, he's created an army of people with magic\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:58.000\ngenes on that they're worse than 911.\n\n01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000\nSo what happens?\n\n01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000\nYou're the writer.\n\n01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nI wrote a whole movie about the guy and you weren't like, yeah, I thought your momentum would carry you through this.\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nOh man.\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000\nNo.\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nThey become zombies.\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000\nYeah.\n\n01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nThat's what I was thinking.\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nIt just seems like it's just a random.\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000\nThis is like mumblecore.\n\n01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nSo what they call it, mumblecore.\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000\nYeah.\n\n01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nIt's like one of those dupless, dupless brothers.\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nDisappointed Dan.\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nI thought you would have been able to finish this off.\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nThe guy comes and says, those are pants.\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nLike we're crossing the first threshold.\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000\nThose pants, those pants are cursed.\n\n01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000\nSo then he goes like, okay, I should go get them back.\n\n01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000\nAnd the Chinese guy goes, no, you can't.\n\n01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nCause that would be back and forthy.\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.000\nSo, so now all those people are going to, they're going to start fires.\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nAre they going to be Al-Qaeda?\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000\nLet's say, okay, let's say, okay, forget the cursing.\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nLet's say that's.\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nWeddings start hitting people's houses?\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000\nYeah.\n\n01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nWhat does?\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nOh, planes.\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nYeah.\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nWell, what if the gene-wearing people like are, are, they're driven now to return to the\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000\nconcourse?\n\n01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nAnd if they all do something horrible happens.\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000\nIt's really more of a thinker.\n\n01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000\nWhat about, okay, Dan, Dan, forget about the Chinese guy at the door.\n\n01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000\nLike what's the end of your movie?\n\n01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000\nThe guy gives the pants back and what happens?\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000\nWell, the whole movie is, yeah, he gives, well, like in my movie.\n\n01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nThat's the end of the movie?\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000\nHe gives the pants back?\n\n01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nThe end?\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000\nEverybody gives a pair of pants?\n\n01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nThe threshold is he sets out on the road to go give the pants back.\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:42.000\nSo it's a whole quadrant of the circle is 9-11, which is what people want out of this.\n\n01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nFrom the poster.\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nThey're like buying tickets to see this.\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nBecause the, the towers are both legs of pants.\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nThe road trials.\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000\nSorry.\n\n01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000\nTom Kaufman from Rick and Morty, he sent me a picture of the thing and I have, I have\n\n01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nthe log line and the, the title.\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000\nIt's really close.\n\n01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000\nUm, he put the tagline is heroes coming all sizes.\n\n01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000\nHeroes coming all sizes.\n\n01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nWhich is also Willow.\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000\nYeah.\n\n01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nI stole it from Willow, but.\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000\nAnd then, uh, it's, it's Redenham shin, uh, colon pants on fire.\n\n01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000\nBecause he's a liar.\n\n01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nYeah.\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000\nYeah.\n\n01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nAll right.\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000\nYeah.\n\n01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nThe, the pastor has to be cursed.\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000\nThat's just good enough alone.\n\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000\nSo, so the, the, it's a, it's a, it's not a movie.\n\n01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000\nIt's not, it's not like an event film.\n\n01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000\nIt's like a tearjerker and an Oscar winner.\n\n01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nLike he, he goes on a journey of self discovery.\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nLike he figures out who he is.\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000\nWhy did he take those pants?\n\n01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000\nWhat the fuck is wrong with him?\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nSo what does he find out at the end?\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000\nWhat, what does he learn?\n\n01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nThe whole system's fucked.\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.000\nAnd you know, like fucking rich people should die.\n\n01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000\nBut anybody that makes more than me, like, like, like billionaires,\n\n01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nthey should, they should have all their money redistributed.\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000\nThat's what he finds out.\n\n01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000\nBut then there's nothing about it.\n\n01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nThat's the end of the film.\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nWell, I just, that's a lot to take in.\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nHe's probably need a voiceover.\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nBut you got, you got all these magic.\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000\nNo, he gives all the pants.\n\n01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000\nYou don't deal with the magic pants.\n\n01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nWhy are they magic?\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000\nThey're not magic.\n\n01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nThey fit.\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nBecause the traveling pants of the sisterhood, they, it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't like,\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nthey didn't stop the movie and go, holy fuck, the devil is real.\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:28.000\nLike they, it was, it was just the idea that these girls like were bonded in a way.\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nLike every time they put on the pants, I assume that they fit.\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000\nHe's giving his pants away to strangers that aren't characters in the movie.\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nHe's just giving, as a montage.\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nAnd they all fit because he, okay.\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nSo they all fit when his, when his like apology is real.\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nOkay.\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nAll right.\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nI got it.\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nSo the goddess is like a hot woman and her husband died in 9-11.\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nAnd he chokes up on the bat.\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000\nLike he changes a couple of things and the pants don't fit.\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nWhy?\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000\nBecause he hasn't come clean.\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nHe's like, it's like a quantum leap rules.\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nHe's got to, he's got to come a hundred percent clean with the people he gives the pants to\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000\nor they don't fit.\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nAnd she's like hot.\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000\nSo he's like tempted.\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nHe doesn't want to be a piece of shit and like, because he wants to date her.\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nSo he, he kind of, he changes a couple of details about his pants looting and his steak in 9-11\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nand stuff.\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nAnd she's like, oh, so you're kind of a hero.\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nAnd he's like, yeah.\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000\nAnd then she's like, okay, well, let's go on that date.\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000\nAnd I'm going to wear my new pants to the date.\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nAnd he's like, cool.\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nI'm going to get so late.\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nAnd it's good.\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nAnd then she's like, they don't fit.\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nAnd that's like, and then, and then he's like, well, here's another pair.\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000\nAnd she's like, these don't fit either.\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nWhat the fuck's going on?\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nI don't know why she'd be.\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000\nSo it's like, it's like Groundhog Day.\n\n01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000\nHe has to learn how to be honest.\n\n01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000\nLike he has to get it right and find out how to make the pants fit on his hot chick.\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nI think they all become zombies.\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nAll right.\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nWell, let's develop it later.\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nWe should only spend like a maximum of 20 minutes developing the 9-11.\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nI don't care if it takes all fucking night.\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000\nWe're going to fucking hash this out.\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nYou know, you let it go.\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nYou got to step back and then you work on other projects.\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nRight?\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nRight.\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nLet's bring Timorge out in preparation.\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nTimorge Brown.\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nYeah.\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nHey, I heard car jumper got canceled at channel 101.\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000\nThat was the thing that happened.\n\n01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000\nYes.\n\n01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nI was at my rap party for community.\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nWas that the longest running show of all time?\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000\nIt is.\n\n01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nHow many episodes?\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000\n20 what?\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000\n25.\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000\n25.\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000\n25.\n\n01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000\n25.\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000\n25.\n\n01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000\n25.\n\n01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000\n25.\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000\n25.\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000\n25.\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000\n25.\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000\n25.\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000\n25.\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000\n25.\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000\n25.\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000\n25.\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000\n25.\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000\n25.\n\n01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000\n25.\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000\n25.\n\n01:26:24.000 -->

01:26:30.000\n25.\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000\n25.\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000\n25.\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000\n25.\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000\n25.\n\n01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000\n25.\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000\n25.\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000\n25.\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000\n25.\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000\n35.\n\n01:26:39.000 -->

01:26:54.280\nkind of like introspective kind of show.\n\n01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:58.880\nI feel like we should commit to some shadow run in a way like we really get down to like\n\n01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.880\nget into some shit done.\n\n01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:00.880\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:01.880\nYou guys down for that?\n\n01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:02.880\nAll

there.\n\n01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.640\nShe's gonna make it on her own.\n\n01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.520\nShe has no parade to throw into the air at that last minute.\n\n01:27:47.520 -->

when I went woo.\n\n01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.520\nSorry.\n\n01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.520\nYou know nothing.\n\n01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.520\nI just realized I was really awkward.\n\n01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.520\nI'm like hi.\n\n01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.520\nThat's right.\n\n01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:07.800\nI don't think in a show when people applaud for someone your first thought is, ah the\n\n01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.080\nfix is in.\n\n01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.080\nThey must have brought 50 people.\n\n01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:14.080\nJulia was it?\n\n01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.080\nYes.\n\n01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.080\nJulia where are you from?\n\n01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.080\nOriginally northeast Ohio.\n\n01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.080\nNortheast so that would be Toledo?\n\n01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.080\nYoungster.\n\n01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.080\nCleveland-ish.\n\n01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:24.080\nCleveland-ish.\n\n01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:28.960\nI grew up with Amish so like Cleveland and more east.\n\n01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:29.960\nThere's a reason why I moved.\n\n01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.320\nDid you say you grew up with Amish?\n\n01:28:32.320 -->

Ohio.\n\n01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.240\nHow did they get there?\n\n01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.240\nThey watched I guess.\n\n01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:49.600\nYou don't have to answer it was a dumb question.\n\n01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:54.120\nI apologize and sorry to my mom if she ever does see this but I'm a little high when I\n\n01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.120\nneed to.\n\n01:28:55.120 -->

hairs.\n\n01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:25.000\nDo you want to switch places with Erin right now?\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.520\nShe's yanking dog string out of a dog anus.\n\n01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.520\nAlmost forgot.\n\n01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.520\nAll right.\n\n01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.520\nWell you're quite a character.\n\n01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:39.520\nShe's like Julie Haggerty meets Mary Tyler Moore meets Ann Margaret.\n\n01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.520\nAnn Margaret.\n\n01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:44.520\nOh my god.\n\n01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.320\nDid you, how are you living in

01:29:53.120\nAnd what's your ambition?\n\n01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:59.720\nI kind of accidentally fell into working in the thing I did the most which is podcasting.\n\n01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:08.320\nAnd yeah one guy really but I worked for an amazing comedian Erin Foley and if any of\n\n01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.320\nyou know her.\n\n01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.320\nErin Foley's amazing.\n\n01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:15.160\nYeah she's really funny and I'm really fortunate to work with some really funny people.\n\n01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.720\nSo you work on Erin Foley's podcast?\n\n01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.440\nNo I help make it happen.\n\n01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.560\nI do this stuff, the minutiae.\n\n01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:27.440\nLike you're the producer or a producer of her podcast.\n\n01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:28.600\nThe helper of things.\n\n01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.200\nYou book guests and stuff.\n\n01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.200\nSometimes if she needs

01:30:46.040\nBut I also do weird voice work and things so yeah so I'm like why not try podcasting.\n\n01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.040\nWhy not woo?\n\n01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.280\nNobody else wooed,

that's just joined our cast.\n\n01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:13.160\nI'm wearing a skirt, I'm trying not to sit awkwardly where I'm like I kind of have to\n\n01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:14.960\nsidesettle where I'm like hey.\n\n01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.960\nI'm an ottoman now.\n\n01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:16.960\nHey what's up guys?\n\n01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:17.960\nThis is still weird.\n\n01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:23.520\nIt's going to be a shadow run of all time.\n\n01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:27.680\nSo Julia are you familiar with Mercy O'Donnell's character?\n\n01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:28.680\nGrace?\n\n01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:29.680\nYeah.\n\n01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:30.680\nYes.\n\n01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.680\nAnd you're looking down at her character sheet you're familiar with her attributes?\n\n01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:36.960\nI'm going to do my best.\n\n01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:40.600\nI can't wait to be as high as you are after this show.\n\n01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:41.800\nSee me after the show.\n\n01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.800\nWhoa.\n\n01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.800\nOh damn.\n\n01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:44.800\nWink.\n\n01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:45.800\nWhat about me?\n\n01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800\nYou're there too.\n\n01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.800\nThat was prenatal.\n\n01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:48.800\nThat's her.\n\n01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.800\nAre you higher than her?\n\n01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:50.800\nIs she higher than you?\n\n01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.800\nNo man.\n\n01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:52.800\nI'm not, no.\n\n01:31:52.800 --> 01:32:03.320\nI have my answer.\n\n01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.880\nMy nervousness manifests itself differently.\n\n01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:06.880\nThat's all.\n\n01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:07.880\nIt's true.\n\n01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:08.880\nSee?\n\n01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:19.280\nThe laugh is like the Warner Brothers sound effect library woman laughing from the 60s.\n\n01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.080\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:22.840\nNo, don't.\n\n01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:23.840\nIt's absolutely fine.\n\n01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:24.840\nShe's Mary Tellermore.\n\n01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:27.360\nA little Goldie Hahn, a little Mary Tellermore.\n\n01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:32.680\nIf you listen back on a few live podcasts of various kinds, you can apparently pick\n\n01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.840\nme out and I apologize.\n\n01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:37.280\nOh we have, we have, we got one of those guys right here.\n\n01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.760\nI know I finally saw him and I'm like oh that's him.\n\n01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:40.760\nHe's the laugh.\n\n01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:41.760\nThat's the laughing guy.\n\n01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:42.760\nIt's the laugh.\n\n01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:43.760\nOh my God.\n\n01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.760\nAnd it's equal.\n\n01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.760\nYou're the laughing guy?\n\n01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.760\nYeah.\n\n01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.320\nI never put a face to you because I was away for all the controversy in your life.\n\n01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:50.320\nOh you weren't here for that?\n\n01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.320\nI was gone for most of that.\n\n01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:52.320\nIt's laughing guy.\n\n01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.320\nWhat's your name again?\n\n01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:54.320\nLaughing guy?\n\n01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.320\nDoug.\n\n01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:56.320\nDoug.\n\n01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:57.320\nLaughing guy.\n\n01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.320\nWhat's your podcast, Doug?\n\n01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.320\nJust in case you didn't know.\n\n01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.320\nOh and we're.\n\n01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.320\nYeah.\n\n01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:02.320\nIt's called You and Me and Thoughts and Talk.\n\n01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.120\nYou and Me and Thoughts and Talk with Doug Culp.\n\n01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.120\nHow do you get through it?\n\n01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:08.320\nLike, isn't it just you, like, like.\n\n01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:10.600\nYeah, it is.\n\n01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.600\nHe does laugh on it.\n\n01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.600\nOh can I say one more thing really quick.\n\n01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:20.280\nI was actually listening to Super Ego on the way over here and I had no idea.\n\n01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:22.720\nYou were the Sam Elliott.\n\n01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.560\nThat's one of my favorite bits with Shunt McGuffin.\n\n01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:26.560\nOh yeah.\n\n01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.880\nI had no idea and then I heard Dana Harmon and I was like, oh wait, the Muppet one.\n\n01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:30.880\nThat's all.\n\n01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:31.880\nSorry.\n\n01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:32.880\nJeff does a good Sam Elliott.\n\n01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:33.880\nI apologize.\n\n01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.880\nI'm not going to have that much next time.\n\n01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.880\nI'm so sorry you guys.\n\n01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:38.880\nAlright, Julia.\n\n01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:39.880\nHere's the status.\n\n01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:40.880\nYou're high.\n\n01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:41.880\nYou're here.\n\n01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.880\nYeah.\n\n01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:43.880\nYou're about to play Shatter Run with us.\n\n01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:44.880\nI'm going to try.\n\n01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:48.680\nMy advice to you is to let it wash over you and to dig deep and as we play Shatter Run.\n\n01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:51.480\nSpencer, do we have a guest intro?\n\n01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:54.880\nYeah, I think it's by Let's Be Safe But Again.\n\n01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.880\nAlright.\n\n01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:58.280\nA lot of people have been sending, not a lot.\n\n01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.880\nPeople have been sending me in.\n\n01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:01.880\nA lot of the ones I haven't read were too long.\n\n01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:05.640\nIf anyone's curious, wants to revise their work, no offense.\n\n01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.200\nWhat's a good range for length?\n\n01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:11.480\nIt's just, I mean, if you write it, read it out loud and see how long it takes.\n\n01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:14.480\nYeah, I would say 45 seconds is probably a good thing, right?\n\n01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:15.480\nYeah.\n\n01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:16.480\nWe run a tight ship over here.\n\n01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:17.480\nWe really do.\n\n01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:22.280\nIf our show is proofing anything, get your shit together.\n\n01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.600\nWell, I kind of do, right?\n\n01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:26.040\nI got to keep a tight ship.\n\n01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:27.040\nYou do.\n\n01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.040\nNo, you should.\n\n01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.040\nYeah, I do.\n\n01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.540\nYou're allowed to.\n\n01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:32.540\nThank you.\n\n01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:38.880\nYou're saying to those would-be intro Shatter Run people, writers, keep it around under\n\n01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:39.880\na minute.\n\n01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.480\nYeah, no offense.\n\n01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:42.480\nIt's good stuff.\n\n01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:46.360\nIt's all good stuff.\n\n01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:48.200\nThanks to our video listeners.\n\n01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:53.360\nAll right, Spencer, take it away.\n\n01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:59.080\nAll right.\n\n01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:04.480\nLast time on Harmontown, Shadow Town, after completing their first mission, the gang\n\n01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:10.440\nkicked back for some much-needed R&R, lounging around the pool table at their usual watering\n\n01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.440\nhole.\n\n01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.440\nHanks last stand.\n\n01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.400\nThey indulged in their favorite vices.\n\n01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:20.040\nTheir moment of peace was shattered when an old, extremely Italian man named Ryan Dervish\n\n01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:23.600\nbarged in screaming, jittery, and jumping.\n\n01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:28.360\nAfter calming down, he explained that the notorious Spaguli crime family has kidnapped\n\n01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:29.920\nhis son, Jelly.\n\n01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:35.560\nOne over by his offer of 2,000 new yin a piece and a pair of fancy Italian shoes, our heroes\n\n01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:39.040\naccepted the mission to retrieve Jelly Dervish.\n\n01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:44.440\nThe old man intimated that Arturo Spaguli, a big, stupid dick, might know something\n\n01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.400\nabout the kidnapping.\n\n01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:51.600\nThe gang resolved to confront Arturo at his favorite eatery, the Burger Tyrant.\n\n01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:54.960\nBut will they find stupid Arturo, the big dick?\n\n01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:00.240\nWill they use their well-known skills and famous teamwork to extract information?\n\n01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:04.960\nWill they retrieve Jelly Dervish with their usual discretion and grace?\n\n01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:11.960\nDoubts on a Harmontown, Shadow Tyrant, thank you.\n\n01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:21.920\nOkay, so we're on our way to a restaurant to, uh, to, uh, we're going to the Burger\n\n01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:22.920\nTyrant?\n\n01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:28.080\nYeah, you're headed towards the Bu, uh, the Burger Tyrant, the Buber Tyrant.\n\n01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:30.800\nWell, what kind of vehicle are we in right now?\n\n01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.800\nYou're in an Uber.\n\n01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:32.800\nWe're in an Uber.\n\n01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.720\nWhat's our, uh, hey, driver, what's your name?\n\n01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:36.720\nIt's a robot.\n\n01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:37.720\nRobot, what's your...\n\n01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:43.320\nIs the robot programmed to sexually harass women, or does that slowly drop away as the\n\n01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.320\nUber enters the future?\n\n01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:49.040\nAnd is the robot, is the robot programmed after you get out of the car to keep the meter\n\n01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:53.200\nrunning and pretend that the ride is canceled but charge you for a ride that you didn't\n\n01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.200\ndo and keep running in the meantime?\n\n01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.200\nOh, shit.\n\n01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.200\nGauntlet.\n\n01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:58.200\nDown.\n\n01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.200\nAll of those things.\n\n01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.200\nYet we never use Lyft.\n\n01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.200\nI use Lyft all the fucking time.\n\n01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:02.200\nLyft is great.\n\n01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.200\nThe Uber comes...\n\n01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.200\nDriving you happy.\n\n01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.200\nSuck a dick.\n\n01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.200\nThat's what they say.\n\n01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.600\nHey, uh, hey, uh, robot, how far away from my Burger Tyrant?\n\n01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:10.960\nOh, we're pretty close.\n\n01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:16.440\nYou guys should, uh, have just enough time to formulate a plan.\n\n01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:17.440\nNightblade.\n\n01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.440\nWhat you got?\n\n01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:26.520\nUh, not the planning type of such, but, uh, I just want to get straight in my head, uh,\n\n01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:30.040\nthis guy, uh, he's the one who might know where Jelly is.\n\n01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.040\nArturo Spaguli.\n\n01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.040\nYeah.\n\n01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.040\nHe's a dick.\n\n01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.040\nAll right.\n\n01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:38.720\nUh, so we should probably lure him out, uh, figure out a way to get him by himself.\n\n01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:43.120\nUh, got a feeling he'll be probably surrounded by a lot of, a lot of guys.\n\n01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.200\nHey, um, Hortegaard, can you find out what kind of car Arturo Spaguli drives?\n\n01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:53.280\nIs it, is it possible that I could, uh, possibly, uh, re-contact, uh, my friend Rich Bielsen?\n\n01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.280\nUh, yeah.\n\n01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.280\nRich?\n\n01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.280\nRich.\n\n01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:58.280\nYes.\n\n01:37:58.280 --> 01:37:59.280\nHey.\n\n01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.280\nHow are you?\n\n01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.280\nHey, it's Rich.\n\n01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.280\nHey.\n\n01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.880\nDon't, uh, be aggressive with me.\n\n01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:05.880\nOh.\n\n01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.480\nThis is just my voice.\n\n01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.480\nOkay.\n\n01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:14.200\nUm, there's, uh, we obviously were looking for this, uh, this asshole, this sort of dick,\n\n01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:15.200\nthe person.\n\n01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.200\nYeah.\n\n01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.000\nUm, is that it possible that we could lead, lead, lure him?\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.960\nIs there something that would bring him out, perhaps, uh, uh, since he's been drinking\n\n01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:28.680\na glass of water, or, uh, is there some other sort of totem that we might bring him outside\n\n01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:31.480\nwith, to get him outside of his protection?\n\n01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:32.480\nHmm.\n\n01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:33.480\nThat's a good question.\n\n01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.280\nI don't really know the guy personally.\n\n01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.920\nI just, uh, I put some, I put some, you know, some of my ears out and found out that's where\n\n01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:40.920\nhe is.\n\n01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.080\nYou might, you might have better luck asking around elsewhere.\n\n01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.880\nIs it, uh, oh, you still talking to this guy?\n\n01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:52.600\nIs it possible that I could use another identity and perhaps go in and lure him out myself?\n\n01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:53.840\nIt's certainly possible.\n\n01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:58.920\nIs it also possible that we could use our, uh, our, our, our fabulous face?\n\n01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:02.160\nThe one to the right of me, although you're not looking at me right now, but the one to\n\n01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:03.160\nthe right of me.\n\n01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.320\nI say we, we, we, we send in the fabulous way.\n\n01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:11.040\nI say we use, uh, Mercy O'Donnell as much as possible on this mission.\n\n01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.280\nI think this is Mercy's time to shine.\n\n01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.280\nYeah.\n\n01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.320\nI knew I was going to make it.\n\n01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:20.400\nMercy, uh, uh, uh, driver, are we here at the burger challenge?\n\n01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.320\nUh, we're just pulling up to three blocks away.\n\n01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:29.240\nRich Billson, Rich Billson, uh, there are a few times that I will say this.\n\n01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:32.240\nI apologize for, uh, uh, abusing your time.\n\n01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:33.760\nI will make this up to you later.\n\n01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:34.760\nWe have a plan.\n\n01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.280\nUh, we've come up with it on our own.\n\n01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.280\nUh, good day, sir.\n\n01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.280\nThanks, man.\n\n01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:42.080\nLet's do, uh, let's do a blue beauty with a honeypot on the front end.\n\n01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:45.520\nDo you think it's a good idea?\n\n01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.080\nSeems to be the configuration.\n\n01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.080\nOkay.\n\n01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.080\nMost conducive in the situation.\n\n01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.080\nI'll be, I'll be the honeypot.\n\n01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.080\nNo, wait.\n\n01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:57.440\nUh, if I could, uh, perhaps the honeypot could be somebody else.\n\n01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.080\nIs that possible?\n\n01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:02.600\nDo we, do we know his sexual proclivities?\n\n01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.400\nDo we know, you know, when he's saying this?\n\n01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:09.840\nYou have a face that is irresistible regardless of sexual proclivities.\n\n01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:10.840\nIt deals in the currency.\n\n01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.840\nI can't tell you how many times I've said it.\n\n01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:13.840\nHey, guys, guys.\n\n01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:14.840\nThe currency of raw traction.\n\n01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:15.840\nI huddled everybody up.\n\n01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:19.040\nI said, look, I think that we'd be fooling ourselves if we didn't think the best plan\n\n01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:25.640\nis to send Mercy O'Donnell just right in the front door as the, as the honeypot.\n\n01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:33.280\nYour job is to get him, get him over to, uh, our prearranged location, uh, which is, which\n\n01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:36.400\nis just out back of the burger tyrant.\n\n01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:37.400\nOkay.\n\n01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.000\nSo we're at the front of the burger tyrant.\n\n01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.480\nYou're three blocks away.\n\n01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.040\nWe're three blocks away still.\n\n01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.200\nCould the driver perhaps pull up to the back of the, well, if we get too close, they're\n\n01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.560\ngoing to, they're going to send something's up.\n\n01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:50.560\nOkay.\n\n01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:51.560\nLet's stop.\n\n01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:52.560\nI mean, I can walk.\n\n01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:56.480\nShould we stop a block away nightblade and let Mercy O'Donnell walk in the front?\n\n01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:59.760\nI don't get my Beyonce stride on.\n\n01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:03.040\nI think you, I think you go in, we do, we do one of these.\n\n01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:11.520\nYou go in and then, uh, like, uh, we stage a, uh, she has a falling out with her, uh,\n\n01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:17.080\nher boy and then wait, I'm trying to figure out how to, like, why don't you be the boy?\n\n01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.760\nShe'll, uh, and then she's going to get him out to the car.\n\n01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:24.440\nIf the simple version is she just gets him out to the car and then we're all in the car.\n\n01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.640\nThe more complex version is to get him even further away.\n\n01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:30.360\nWhy can't I just try and convince him to come with me into the car?\n\n01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.360\nI think we just let her do her thing.\n\n01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.360\nOkay.\n\n01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.360\nAll right.\n\n01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:35.360\nFirst we let this happen.\n\n01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:36.360\nYeah.\n\n01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.360\nAnd let her get him outside of the building and then we work on it.\n\n01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.360\nWell, we're all, we're all listening.\n\n01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.360\nWe'll all be in the car.\n\n01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.760\nYou just get him out into the car.\n\n01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:42.760\nYeah.\n\n01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:43.760\nAll right.\n\n01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:44.760\nYeah.\n\n01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:50.760\nI played this on focus at this time, so yeah, yeah, another hour of unfocused.\n\n01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:51.760\nAll right.\n\n01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.160\nSo are we a block away?\n\n01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.160\nYes.\n\n01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.160\nSpencer.\n\n01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.160\nYep.\n\n01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.160\nAll right.\n\n01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:59.160\nMercy.\n\n01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:00.160\nYes.\n\n01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.160\nI trust you implicitly.\n\n01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:02.160\nYou really should.\n\n01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:03.160\nI got this.\n\n01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.160\nGo knock him dead.\n\n01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:09.160\nI have exceptional charisma and, uh, negotiation top notch.\n\n01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:13.160\nIs it possible I could be both a physical and emotional spotter?\n\n01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:19.160\nPlease, I think maybe not hovering in the background, but perhaps just staying close\n\n01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.400\nby in case things go awry.\n\n01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.400\nYeah.\n\n01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:23.640\nIt could go off the rails.\n\n01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:27.400\nIt may very well.\n\n01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:30.600\nSo what's the move gentlemen and lady?\n\n01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.600\nIt's mercy time.\n\n01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:34.160\nIt's fucking mercy time.\n\n01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.160\nAll right.\n\n01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.760\nMercy, go in there and work your charms.\n\n01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:37.760\nOkay.\n\n01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:42.560\nSo get, get, go, go meet our tourist bagouli and try to find out and get him out to the\n\n01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:43.760\ncar with us.\n\n01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.760\nOkay.\n\n01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.960\nSo right now it's just me and walking in.\n\n01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.560\nOh, you must whip it.\n\n01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:51.560\nOkay.\n\n01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:55.360\nSo I get to the burger tyrant.\n\n01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:56.360\nWalk in.\n\n01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:58.360\nWhat's, what's the surrounding?\n\n01:42:58.360 --> 01:42:59.360\nAll right.\n\n01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:03.880\nSo, uh, the burger tyrant is classic garbage food of the sixth world, 3D printers, squirting\n\n01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:09.120\nout grease and krill protein into recognizable shapes injected with flavor simulates and\n\n01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.280\nmicrowave it for perfection to perfection.\n\n01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:15.520\nBurger tyrant is the pinnacle of the technology serving millions of day.\n\n01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:17.040\nThis location looks pretty new.\n\n01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:22.240\nSo it must have been rebuilt to the tyrant's new security slash hygiene specifications.\n\n01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:27.320\nStanding tall in front of the front door is a hologram icon of the burger tyrant himself.\n\n01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:33.440\nHis arms are open wide and he proclaims, all are welcome and get your burgers done right.\n\n01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:37.160\nBut please, oh please don't go and fight.\n\n01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.240\nLeave your weapons at home.\n\n01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:41.120\nLeave your weapons at home.\n\n01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:43.360\nLeave your weapons at home.\n\n01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.880\nThis guy's a real burger tyrant.\n\n01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.600\nHe's really into that.\n\n01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:51.600\nAll right.\n\n01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.600\nI like it.\n\n01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:58.960\nJust to be safe, I astrally project alongside Mercy, like to go alongside or into the burger\n\n01:43:58.960 --> 01:43:59.960\ntyrant.\n\n01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:00.960\nOkay.\n\n01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:01.960\nYou're, you're a ghost.\n\n01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:02.960\nOkay.\n\n01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:03.960\nCould be dangerous.\n\n01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.360\nYou go first.\n\n01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:08.680\nTry not to ghost block.\n\n01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:13.880\nSo you step into the, you step into the burger tyrant, it's, it's a filthy joint.\n\n01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:19.800\nIt looks like it must be one of those franchise locations rather than a corporate place specifically\n\n01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:23.240\nbecause the security detail is woefully substandard.\n\n01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:27.600\nThere's usually about five armed guards on duty at your average burger tyrant.\n\n01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.040\nHere you only see one.\n\n01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:32.920\nHe's wearing a bulletproof vest and he's picking his nose.\n\n01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:39.040\nThe second you walk into the door, however, you hear a piercing shrill alarm shriek, blights\n\n01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:44.600\nstart flashing and going off right as you, right as you, uh, enter the door and three\n\n01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:50.640\nfry cooks and, uh, the security guard all pull guns and level pistols right at you.\n\n01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:52.600\nThey say no weapons.\n\n01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.600\nGet out of here.\n\n01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:55.000\nWe're shooting you to death.\n\n01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.040\nHey, hey, calm down.\n\n01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:58.040\nNo weapons.\n\n01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.120\nHey, hold on.\n\n01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:00.120\nIt's law.\n\n01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.120\nHold on.\n\n01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.120\nJust a second.\n\n01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:04.360\nLet's just step it back.\n\n01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.360\nNo weapons.\n\n01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.360\nHold on.\n\n01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:11.680\nWhat if, can I, uh, like coat check these because there's some way I can just drop these\n\n01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.440\noff, pick them up on my way out.\n\n01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.440\nYeah.\n\n01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:17.360\nGo outside, do that, then come back and we'll give you burgers.\n\n01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:20.880\nHey, hey, that sounds amazing.\n\n01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:21.880\nThank you for complying.\n\n01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:24.960\nHey, no worries, no worries, not a problem.\n\n01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:27.360\nUh, I'll be right back.\n\n01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:31.400\nUh, I am just outside the door and ready to collect such weapons.\n\n01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:32.400\nExcellent.\n\n01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.520\nI've taken them all.\n\n01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:39.400\nSo I have no, so I have zero weapons.\n\n01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:40.400\nOkay.\n\n01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:45.960\nOh, I feel like, I feel like Marcy right now, just very scared, but I'm going to power\n\n01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:46.960\nthrough.\n\n01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:48.160\nSo I'm going back in there.\n\n01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:49.160\nAll right.\n\n01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.640\nYou do that.\n\n01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:55.160\nYou see the, the, the fry cooks, they're not pointing guns at you anymore.\n\n01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.440\nThey're just milling about the auto fooders.\n\n01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:00.360\nThere's a couple of folks just sitting with their meals.\n\n01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.400\nSee Arturo Spagulli seated in the corner.\n\n01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.520\nHe's wearing a fine Italian suit and he's eating, he's eating two burgers in two hands.\n\n01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.520\nWhoa.\n\n01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.320\nHe's double fisting the meat.\n\n01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:15.800\nHe's double fisting both meats.\n\n01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:19.640\nGiven the circumstances, can I use my cobalt sense instantly just to find out if there\n\n01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:20.640\nis any threat?\n\n01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.640\nOh, there's threats.\n\n01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:22.640\nLike with the meat undercooked?\n\n01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:29.640\nThe meat is always cooked in this place, hot meat, always.\n\n01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:30.640\nYes.\n\n01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:31.640\nThreats.\n\n01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:32.640\nOkay.\n\n01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:33.640\nEnd of the comlink.\n\n01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:34.640\nOkay.\n\n01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.640\nHe does that a lot.\n\n01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.640\nHe's like, it's like, how many of these people are my friends?\n\n01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:50.640\nThat's like, well, they're trying to kill you.\n\n01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:52.640\nSays the man sitting in the van.\n\n01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:53.640\nThat's it.\n\n01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:54.640\nI'm checking my email.\n\n01:46:54.640 --> 01:47:02.640\nThis isn't really, you know, a resume for my proclivities.\n\n01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:06.640\nAll right.\n\n01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:07.640\nWhat's the move?\n\n01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:08.640\nHey, real quick.\n\n01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:12.640\nDo I actually have, I mean, I said that I gave all my weapons.\n\n01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:15.640\nWhat are you from Atlanta?\n\n01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:23.640\nOne of my friends used to get really high and then he would start just, he would go from\n\n01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:24.640\nlike, what's up guys?\n\n01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:25.640\nLike, hi.\n\n01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:27.640\nThey can't see who you're talking to right now.\n\n01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.640\nYou have to talk to the man.\n\n01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:31.640\nOh, I apologize.\n\n01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:33.640\nApparently I lose control of my vocals.\n\n01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:34.640\nYou're fine.\n\n01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:36.640\nI'm sorry, you guys.\n\n01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:37.640\nOkay.\n\n01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:39.640\nSo I'm trying to get back on task.\n\n01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:40.640\nBack on the train.\n\n01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:41.640\nSorry.\n\n01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:43.640\nSpencer, I actually have a real question.\n\n01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:44.640\nYeah.\n\n01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:45.640\nAbout your weapons?\n\n01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:46.640\nYeah.\n\n01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:51.640\nSo knife, do I actually have like any hidden anything that I can get through is, I mean,\n\n01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.640\nis there a chance I could sneak something through just in case?\n\n01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:55.640\nYou don't think so.\n\n01:47:55.640 --> 01:48:00.640\nYou know, in today's day and age, weapon and metal detectors are highly, highly elaborate.\n\n01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:04.640\nYou'd have to have a weapon designed specifically to bypass that security.\n\n01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:05.640\nAll right.\n\n01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:06.640\nI was just double checking.\n\n01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:07.640\nJust double checking.\n\n01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:11.640\nI go in the comment and say, Mercy, ask him to go outside with you.\n\n01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.640\nIf that's not going to work, we're going to come storm into place and kick ass.\n\n01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:16.640\nYeah, it's not really that kind of mission, you know.\n\n01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:17.640\nNo, I'm just going to convince him.\n\n01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:20.640\nObjectify you or anything, but you know.\n\n01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:21.640\nYeah.\n\n01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:23.640\nI just got to try and somehow convince him to come out.\n\n01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:24.640\nJust ask him and see what happens.\n\n01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:25.640\nJust make the approach.\n\n01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.640\nYeah.\n\n01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.640\nPut on your finest face.\n\n01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:30.640\nI tried that hours ago.\n\n01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:31.640\nI apologize.\n\n01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:32.640\nOkay.\n\n01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.640\nSo.\n\n01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:34.640\nOh, Jim.\n\n01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:35.640\nOh, Jim.\n\n01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:36.640\nSorry, DeMorge.\n\n01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:37.640\nOh, my God.\n\n01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:38.640\nOkay.\n\n01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:49.640\nSo I'm going in there and who's with me again?\n\n01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:50.640\nNo one.\n\n01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:51.640\nWell, you're all alone.\n\n01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:52.640\nYou're wrong.\n\n01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:53.640\nThere's the ghost.\n\n01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:54.640\nMercy.\n\n01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:55.640\nI'm on the comlink.\n\n01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:56.640\nI'm talking to you.\n\n01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:57.640\nThis is Eve Libertine talking.\n\n01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:58.640\nYou're a ghost right now.\n\n01:48:58.640 --> 01:48:59.640\nI'm talking to you.\n\n01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:01.640\nCan I talk to you on comlink in my astral form?\n\n01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:03.640\nNo, you could talk to her as a ghost.\n\n01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.640\nOh, so he like.\n\n01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.640\nGhost talking.\n\n01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.640\nI'm in the room with you.\n\n01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.640\nI'm actually in the room with you.\n\n01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:10.640\nI got you.\n\n01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:13.640\nIf you want me to manifest and kick ass, I can't walk up to him and tell him what you want.\n\n01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:22.640\nI already got him outside alone.\n\n01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:23.640\nWait a minute.\n\n01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:24.640\nWhat?\n\n01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:25.640\nOkay.\n\n01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:26.640\nSo.\n\n01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:31.640\nWalk up to Arturo Spagulli and say, would you come outside with us?\n\n01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:32.640\nArturo.\n\n01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:33.640\nMe.\n\n01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:35.640\nYou walk up to him and he's got a mouth full of burger.\n\n01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:37.640\nHe's, he's barely paying you any mind.\n\n01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.640\nHe barely glances at you.\n\n01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:43.640\nThe comlink I suggest you know how to do this the right way.\n\n01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:48.640\nThe right way?\n\n01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:50.640\nIn your window.\n\n01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:51.640\nOkay.\n\n01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:52.640\nArturo.\n\n01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:54.640\nHow are you?\n\n01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:57.640\nI'm hungry.\n\n01:49:57.640 --> 01:49:58.640\nHungry.\n\n01:49:58.640 --> 01:49:59.640\nYeah.\n\n01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:00.640\nYeah.\n\n01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:02.640\nI like, I like some meats.\n\n01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:05.640\nNot so much ham, but I like meat.\n\n01:50:05.640 -->

you to suck a dick.\n\n01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:38.640\nJust ask him to go outside.\n\n01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:41.640\nSay you have a joint and you're going to fucking get high again.\n\n01:51:41.640 -->

want to get high and play Skyrim with me?\n\n01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:57.640\nOr you can sit next to me and watch me make this amazing waterfall out of lava.\n\n01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:01.640\nOh, I was
