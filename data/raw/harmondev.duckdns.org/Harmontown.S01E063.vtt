{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:11.000\nFrom the Nerdist Theater at Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California,\n\n00:11.000 --> 00:17.000\nHarmontown is in session. Please welcome the mayor of Harmontown,\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:35.000\nDan Harmon.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:51.000\nAlright, we got a lot to do. Quit fucking around.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:56.000\nAlright, I'm out of breath. Just give me a second.\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:08.000\nThis is the definition of what is aerobic exercise because so close to what is walking as you get older and older.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:14.000\nI want to start very quickly with a segment that's a favorite for everyone.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:25.000\nIt's called Things that Dan Harmon is not allowed to complain about because it makes him sound like an asshole.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:37.000\nThese are the things that when I complain about them reveal that I'm a narcissistic rich prick with a lower value system than people in Lebanon.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:40.000\nI am a stupid fucking asshole.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:48.000\nAlright, so you're not allowed to judge me because I said that.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:54.000\nOkay, so I valet parked my car constantly, even if I don't have to.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:59.000\nI'll just find someone to valet my car. There will be a parking space.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:03.000\nI'm like, that's not good enough. That's not true.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:06.000\nI'm actually kind of annoyed with the fact that in LA there's valet.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:08.000\nThere will be a parking lot and it's empty.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:13.000\nAnd then there's a guy in front that's like, I'm valeting your car and it makes me mad.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:18.000\nOh shit, seat now. I got a new note-taking app.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:25.000\nIt's called Cat Catch. Everybody just fucking cool it.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:28.000\nWe're going to get through this. We got a lot of shit to do tonight.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:32.000\nItem number one, Things that I'm not allowed to complain about because it'll make me sound like an asshole.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:36.000\nI pull up to the valet.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:42.000\nOne point A is your new application on your phone, your new note app.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:48.000\nYeah, it's not Evernote anymore. Fuck you, Evernote.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:54.000\nSo I pull up to the guy at the valet station and this is happening now with increasing frequency\n\n02:54.000 --> 03:00.000\nas I have more and more to do and more and more sort of liquid assets, I would say, I would call it.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:04.000\nI'll get out at the valet station and the guy will go, are you eating here?\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:08.000\nHe'll give me a half of his little Terry card and I'll go, yes.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:12.000\nAnd then he'll start to get in the car and I'll go, sir, sir, sir.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:18.000\nI have to come back now. Already the purpose of the valet is starting to be defeated.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:25.000\nTime is running out. I got Zoe Deschanels to have lunch with.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nThat's not true.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:33.000\nBut then the guy says, sir, sir, sir, sir. There's a dollar on the floor of the car.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:41.000\nI don't care. It costs $7 to park here. I'm going to tip you three and you asshole.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:43.000\nTake the dollar.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:47.000\nAll right, moving on.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:51.000\nYes, of course, there's a dollar on the floor of my car.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:55.000\nIt's called garbage. The economy's in the toilet.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:58.000\nJust put your gum in it, valet man.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:03.000\nIt's a dollar. We're all dying.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:06.000\nA dollar. I got to come back. What am I supposed to do?\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:09.000\nBecause he gives me the choice between coming back and grubbing for my dollar\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:13.000\nor going like Tom Cruise and some weird man.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:16.000\nIt's yours.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:20.000\nCalling over my shoulder. Keep it, man.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:23.000\nOkay, let's say it's a 20.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:28.000\nI think that's cool. Yeah, it's 20 times a dollar. Don't argue with me. We don't have any time.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:32.000\nAll right, next item.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nThings I can't, I'm not allowed to complain about. This one, it takes too long to poop.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:40.000\nWe can just move on. It just takes too long to poop.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nAnd I don't mean because I'm 40, but just because, well, it is because I'm 40,\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nbecause as you get to 40, time becomes more valuable.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:51.000\nSo see the valet guy. Same thing. I'm becoming conscious of my mortality.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:54.000\nI don't want to, I have to take a shit. I get it, God.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:57.000\nI got to poop to put in the toilet. I just want to get it done.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:01.000\nAnd it's just like I'm sort of sitting there and I'm like, come on, poop.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:05.000\nAre your poops longer than when you were younger? Are they getting older?\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:08.000\nNo, no, no. I've always been, this is one thing I've always been really good at.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:16.000\nI can debate that right there because you gave yourself a hemorrhoid by sitting on the toilet too long.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:21.000\nNo, because I love to sit on the phone and I, but okay, that's the point,\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nis that the doctor told me, like, don't tweet on the toilet.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:28.000\nI didn't know this was a thing and so I was like, okay, I'll stop doing that.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nI used to enjoy my time on the toilet. This is, thank you, Jeff.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:34.000\nThis is exactly why I'm starting to notice. It takes too long to poop\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:38.000\nbecause now I'm not allowed to do other stuff on the toilet. Thank you.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:42.000\nIf I can't do anything but poop, then poop faster.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:47.000\nBut, okay. Superhero movies need earlier thresholds.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:50.000\nNeed earlier thresholds.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:54.000\nMinute 20 into your movie called Captain America.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:58.000\nA comic book no one likes anyway.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:03.000\nI don't, I want to see his fucking round shield flying around.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:07.000\nYou can't say on page 70, oh, look at that shield.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nMaybe that should be red, white and blue.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:13.000\nFuck you, Captain America movie. Fuck you, Superman movie.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:16.000\nFuck you, Hulk movie, whichever third version it was.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nLike, fuck you, superhero movie, Green Lantern.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:24.000\nFuck you. Like, stop, speed it up. You're a superhero movie.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:30.000\nI bought a ticket because I already accept that a guy can get a wooba from the planet Booba\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:34.000\nand as a result, he's allowed to fooba.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:39.000\nNo one fucking cares? What are you trying? What are you making on Golden Pond? You fucking assholes?\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:44.000\nKnock it off. Knock it off. In and out. 90 minutes.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:49.000\nPage 20. I'm foobo-ing.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:52.000\nI don't fucking care. Name a thing. Name a noun.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nSomebody say it. Tooba man. Okay.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:59.000\nPage 20 is playing the tuba, okay?\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nAnd using it to fight crime.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:06.000\nI don't mean like, he's got a trumpet and he's like, this should be bigger.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:09.000\nFucking page 20 of your screenplay.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:16.000\nTuba in his mouth blasting, like, radioactive rainbow waves out at a burglar going like,\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:20.000\noh shit, I'm robbing a bank, but now I can't because the tuba man.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:25.000\nBecause the movie's called Tuba Man is why.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nThat's the thing. You can't charge me a ticket.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:33.000\nI have a right to ask for my money back if half the movie's a guy thinking maybe he should\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.000\nmaybe kind of fight something with crime involved.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:39.000\nThere's something involving a tuba. Fuck you.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:42.000\nI said, Captain America's walking around forever in that movie.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:45.000\nHe's like, just dressed as a silly guy.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nI just wish I could fight some Nazis.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nFucking cock.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:53.000\nIt'd be one thing if you were a Spider-Man and you pulled that shit.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:57.000\nYou're Captain America. You're a dick.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nIron Man.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\nI think you're allowed to complain about that.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nYou are allowed to complain about that.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nWell, I'm 40, so it makes me sound like a knob.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:11.000\nI should be putting more thought into Cambodia and things like that.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nWhat's going on in Cambodia?\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nWell, when I was 10, some stuff.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nThat's my point. That's my point.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:22.000\nI don't know what the new Cambodia is.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nI should.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:28.000\nWell, while I'm on the subject, Iron Man should be an alcoholic in the movies.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:33.000\nIn the comic book, he's an alcoholic and it's fucking amazing.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nThat's the important thing about him. Batman's parents got killed.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nFine. That's great. I love Batman.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:41.000\nSpider-Man's like a young naive kid who's like,\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nhe got this responsibility thrust upon him.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nHe's a wisecracker. The whole point of Iron Man,\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:50.000\nhe's the Howard Hughes of superheroes and he's got a drinking problem.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:53.000\nThat's it. But he's good at his shit. He's a functional alcoholic.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:57.000\nWhat's kryptonite? He's so good at drinking.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:02.000\nPeople are like, holy shit, we can't fire him. He drinks too much.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:05.000\nHe gets work done while he's doing it.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nSo it's you?\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:12.000\nWell, I like all of these superheroes for various reasons.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nYou, as a 40-year-old, want your superhero fantasy\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:19.000\nis that you can be a functional alcoholic and still fight crime.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:23.000\nThat ain't no fantasy, Jack.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:26.000\nWhat crime are you fighting?\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:31.000\nThe crime of people not respecting me.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:34.000\nI often lose.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nAll right. That brings me to my next point.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:39.000\nJeff, thank you for your unintentional segue.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nIt's just all instinctual for me, Dan.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.000\nAll right. My next complaint on the list of things\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:47.000\nI'm not allowed to complain about because they make me seem like an asshole.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:50.000\nI'm too famous.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nLet's just move on. Let's just move on.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:55.000\nNext item. I apologize too much.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:58.000\nI'm sick of it. I'm tired of...\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nI'm 40 years old.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:05.000\nI just want to cut my head open and pour the contents of my brain out.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:10.000\nThe idea of an apology is that you clarify to somebody\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nthat you didn't mean to hurt their feelings.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:17.000\nI am the only one who you can actually go and find out whether or not,\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nlike what I really meant.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nIt's not fair. I'm sick of it.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nI'm not a fucking politician. I didn't run for office.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nI'm not accountable to electors.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:32.000\nI stand in front of a microphone. I puke my brains out.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nI have diarrhea of the mouth.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:37.000\nI say for two hours a week how I feel.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nI'm honest about my emotions.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nPeople that don't like me, I don't like you. I hate you.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nYour piece is a shit.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.000\nYour dishonest fucking agents of caution and restraint.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:51.000\nYou want people to talk less. You want people to be more like ants.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nI fucking hate you.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:59.000\nI will apologize to you in a cautious, fucking, like, détente,\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nlike a ceasefire.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\nYou're bad people and I don't care if you don't like me anymore.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nYour piece is a shit. Fuck off.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:10.000\nNext item on my list.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nAgain, you can't argue with this stuff,\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nbecause I'm admitting to you this makes me a bad person\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nfor having these complaints.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:19.000\nNext item. Everyone in the world is stupid.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nEverybody.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nMaybe including me. Time will tell.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nI don't care. Moving on.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:28.000\nThere's no good bar near meltdown.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nThere's nothing. There's no place to drink.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nPanky can take a fuck.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nI didn't go today.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nI can't take it anymore.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nI can't go sit over there.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:41.000\nMaria Conchita Alonso, what's it called? El Compadre?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nYes.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nI can't drink there.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:48.000\nIt turns into a sports bar after 3 p.m.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:51.000\nI don't know what accounting firm is above it,\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:55.000\nbut it just gets flooded with J. Moore clones.\n\n11:55.000 --> 12:00.000\nEveryone's snapping and tapping quarters on the bar,\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:04.000\nand they want their Apple Teenies and their Marga Fooders.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nI can't sit down and have a drink.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nWhat do we think bars are for? What are we doing?\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nYou come into a bar with a group of people\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:14.000\nthat you want to talk to from work, go get a fucking table.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nThere are some of us in this world that are really, really...\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nWe have a disease. I just want to go up to a trough,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nand I want to make eye contact.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nI want to plot my ass down on a stool,\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nand I need my fucking spinach slash kryptonite.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nI need it pumped into my body at a certain rate,\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nand I can't give these people what they want.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nThat's it.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nWe got through that.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nOur next segment.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nI promised we'd bring it back.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nIs Connor here?\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:51.000\nQuestions with Connor.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nYou have another question, Connor?\n\n12:53.000 --> 13:00.000\nQuestions with Connor.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nWelcome back, Connor.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nThank you, Jeff.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nLast week, Connor brought us a tantalizing question\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nof whether it's better to teleport or to have sex.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nI don't know that we totally got to the bottom of that.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nWho knows? That's the point of the question.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nThe question was the journey.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nConnor's conundrums.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nDid you make a decision?\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nI don't know. It sounded like Aaron would be cool\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nwith me not coming.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nI'd like to travel.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:31.000\nI think I would go teleportation ultimately.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nThere was a twist at the very end\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nwhere you started talking about\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nhow you would have the drive to orgasm,\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nbut not the ability.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nWe could play with that. You could choose.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nCan I play with it?\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nNo drive.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nNo drive and teleportation?\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\nI don't want to walk around. If you don't have a desire to,\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nthen there's no point.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:56.000\nIf you have a human desire to enjoy sex,\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nyou get the finish line, buddy.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nI'm just saying.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nYou changed your answer?\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nI thought the curse was that you'd want to,\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.000\nbut you couldn't.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nYou were too busy going to Paris.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nGlasses guy?\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nIf you don't have a biological imperative to,\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nbut you remember it fondly,\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nor...\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:19.000\nSo you just stand up and face everybody right now,\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\njust so you can see what I'm looking at,\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nwhat you're doing.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nDescribe him, Jeff.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:28.000\nThere's a sub-segment called Jeff's Descriptions.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nThere's a six-foot, what are you, four?\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nSix-five gentlemen with a mohawk,\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nand a proper mohawk,\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nwhere it needs to be a long word out of B.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nHe's not that mad at the Queen.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nNo.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nHe still minds the bollocks.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nBut he lives in Parliament.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nYeah.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nHe's also wearing one of the...\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nAt my podium here, I have a pair of\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nLouvert 80s hot pink sunglasses here.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nYou brought these.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nThat doesn't surprise me one bit.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nIt's Tyler, right?\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nSo Tyler, I see a lot of people out here\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nwearing 80s novelty sunglasses.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nAnd, okay, so now you've been described.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nYes.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nAll right, there we go.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nSub-section. Jeff describes people.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nWhat was your point? I'm sorry.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nSo you can go sex or teleportation.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nYou say you wouldn't have the drive for it.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nSo you wouldn't have a biological drive for it,\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nbut you still remember fondly the times\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nthat you did have sex in the past.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nThe nostalgia thing, but not a biological one.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nYeah, but that's not.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nWhen I want to have sex,\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nit's not because I remember it being awesome.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nThat's absolutely...\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nIf you could just take away the...\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nIf you could turn it off.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nIf he has teleportation and unfair advantage,\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nbecause if you can still have sex,\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nyou still have to have the urge to teleport.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nYeah.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:46.000\nOkay, but we've tabled this one\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nbecause now we have a new Connor...\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nYes, all right.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nTony, teleportation.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nConnor Conundrum coming through.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nConnor Conundrum, what about you?\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nAsk yourself this question\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nand you will find...\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nI teleport to a time\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nwhen that song\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nsounds like...\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nIt's like,\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nI teleport to a time\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nwhen that song made sense.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nBad theme song, Bad Evening.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nTeleport to a time?\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nYou can't teleport to a time.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nGoddamn, that's right, I keep thinking time travel.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nAll right, I'm sorry.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nConnor, what is your new conundrum for us this week?\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\nOkay, really quick, did we cheer alcoholism\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\na few minutes ago?\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nYeah,\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nwhen a comic book character\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nthat can make a jet suit has it,\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nthat's amazing.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nLet's make sure we're on the same page.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nAll right, this is my question this week.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nIf you had to choose between\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\ngaining flight\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nbut losing your sight so you become blind,\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nor every time you fart\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nyou accidentally time travel?\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nWhich would you choose?\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nWait,\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nI have 14 questions.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nYou can fly but you can't see.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nYes.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nOr a bat.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nOr a bat.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.000\nAre you a bat?\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nDo you have a sonar?\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nI'm sorry, Connor, just to clarify.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nAre you blind only while you're flying?\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nNo, you're blind all the time.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nOh, go fuck yourself.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nI'm going to fart.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nI'm going to fart accidentally on time travel.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nYeah, I'm immediately on hold\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nfor the farting time travel.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nThere's ways you can hold your fart\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nand explain to people\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nlike a new relationship.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nSweetie, there's something you have to know about me.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nYou may never see me again.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nYou're talking about your maiden\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nin like medieval times because this has already happened before.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nAll right, what's the range of time travel?\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nYou could end up in a lava pit.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nWell, I guess you could\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nyou'd travel from the spot you're in\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nor not?\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nI mean, maybe this is a curse.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nSince everyone farts sooner or later\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nand since time travel is just going to take you\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nto some random place and they're\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\ncompletely destabilized your life and since\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nwell, no, no, fuck you because\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nlike, I'm starting to get so angry at you.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nBut you're saying I have to be blind.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nWell, I think what this one is,\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nthis is not what cool thing would I pick.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nThese are, I'm choosing between two curses here.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nRight.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nWhich they can have incentives, but\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nit's not as...\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nYeah, because the whole point of flight is that you would see the vistas for me,\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nthat you could, you know, you could fly around.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nWell, that's where you're going.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nI'm not going to leave the ground if I can't see.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nYeah, but are you a bat?\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nDo you have that kind of sound\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nlocation kind of thing?\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nI don't think so, but when you lose a sense,\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\naren't there other senses heightened?\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nYeah, but over millennia of\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nevolution.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nIf you gave me the blind flight, I'd fly into a thing.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nOkay, what if you were only blind\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nwhen you flew?\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nConnor, you had a week to figure this out.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nNo time to workshop.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nOkay, if you're only blind\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nwhen you fly, then I'll take the blindness\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nbecause the uncontrollability\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nof the...\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nat the root of it all is my control issues.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nLike, if I'm just farting\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nand I'm randomly time traveling,\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nI can neither control farting\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nnor where I go when I fart\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nand when I come back and stuff.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nLike, if you told me, okay, for instance,\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nif you take the blindness,\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nif you make it, when you fly\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nyou're blind, but when you're not flying\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nyou're not blind, and also\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nwhen you fart\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nyou time travel to somewhere random\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nbut\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nthe next time you fart, you come back.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nOkay, that's a good twist.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nThen I'll take farting because nobody double\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nfarts like\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nVitamin H over here.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nWhat if you triple fart?\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nThen you go...\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nSomewhere new. Then you reject the record.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nI don't know.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nIf you fart an odd number of farts,\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nyou could be the place to see.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nBut then you find some beans\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nin the place to see, and you...\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nThe place to see an error had no beans\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nthen. There's other things that make you\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nfart just.

Everyone you talk to\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nturns blind.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nBut you can tunnel\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nto the center of the earth and not get burnt by the magma.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nUntil you're 40.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nAt which point you have to\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\ndrink magma in order to do a show.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nAll right.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nThink about it.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nWe have a special guest tonight.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nHe was actually briefly up here, like a meteor\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nflashing before you.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nLike a superhero flying through the sky.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nWe want to bring him up again\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nbecause we barely graze the surface\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nand we're not doing it\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nbecause we, I don't know.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nI'm not Tony Danza.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nI'm not bringing up people with recipes.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nI figure the podcast technology\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nis for\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\ndoing stuff you can't do on TV.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nAnd one of those things is that kind of\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nlaying humanity bare.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nAnd one of the craziest things\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nabout humanity, one of the biggest elephants\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nin the room is\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nsickness, mortality, conditions,\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nyou know, like the stuff that we\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nfear the most.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nAnd there are people among us who are\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\ntethered to us with a rope\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nand are hanging out\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\non the precipice of these things that we\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nkind of like,\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.000\nwe fear so much that we\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\ndon't even, it's just more convenient\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nnot to think about them.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nAnd you would think that would not make for good podcast material.\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nBut I have a feeling\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nthat it's really important to talk to this guy.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nYou saw him last week.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nLet's bring Seek Donnelly up here.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nHow are you doing? You said\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nyou had a rough night, but you were\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\ncool to come in today. Yeah, can I stand?\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What happens when you sit?\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nHonestly,\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nI was in a wheelchair for a long time.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nSo when I was learning to walk again.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nSo I have this, when I sit for too\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nlong, I freak out. Oh my god.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nSo you had to re-learn how\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nto walk after the, okay, so\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nlet's explain from the top. So\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nSeek, you, one\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nday you had an aneurysm, which is\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nan explosion in the brain.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nYeah, I was wiping\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nmy butt at LAX with the door open.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nGood one.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nYou can still do, it didn't wipe out the callback part.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nNo, we were just\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nwalking.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nI went to dinner with some friends.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nI was complaining about a migraine.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nI've had migraines since I was eight years old.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nSo we didn't think anything\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nwas different about it.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nAnd then we were going out for the night,\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nand then I just dropped to the ground.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nYou just fell down at LAX or somewhere else?\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nNo, no, no, no, just, yeah, back home.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nJust at your house?\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nWas it, did you feel pain\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nwhen you fell down? I don't remember\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nany of it. I barely\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nremember waking up in the hospital,\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nand then the doctor apparently\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\ntalked to me and said, you know,\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nthere's some complications with what's going on\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nto you. We need to put you in a medically induced coma.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nWe don't know for how long.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nWhich means they give you drugs that\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\njust make you unconscious for a while? I'm just gone.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\nYeah, for 11 days I was out.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nI was only supposed to be out for six or seven days,\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nbut then there was another complication.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nI flatlined, and then\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nthey saved me, and then\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nI was in for another five days.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nSo during this medically induced coma,\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nthey studied your brain a little bit\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nenough to tell you what had happened?\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nWell, yeah, well, and while I was under,\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nthey also did a couple procedures to save\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nmy life. So they did a\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nprocess called coiling, which is\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nthey actually don't go through your\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nbrain to do this. It's going to sound weird.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nThey make an incision in your leg,\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nand they go straight up to your brain,\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nand they put these coils,\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nand these coils are like little copper tubes\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:58.000\nthat, you know, when an aneurysm happens,\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:00.000\nblood is pouring all over your brain,\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nand so everything, the\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nblood touches, it's destroying,\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nand so these coils go in, and they\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nreroute the blood, so that it's not...\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nHow do they get a coil\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nfrom your leg to your brain?\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.000\nHow does it follow any\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\npath?\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nOkay, good. You're not the guy to ask.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nWe'll have a doctor on our team.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nI'll bring my doctor when they...\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nTo interject at this point,\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nlike, this is...\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:28.000\nI'm sure I speak for most people\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nin the audience, like,\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\neven beyond,\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nI think, getting\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\ncertain types of cancer or something.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nThis represents, like,\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\na worst nightmare, because\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nit's so\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nuncontrollable. It's just, you're\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\njust suddenly told, you're walking along,\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\neverything's going fine, you\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nblack out, you wake up in a hospital,\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nand they're telling you, yeah, a thing\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nis happening, and then it gets\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nworse, because now you've been told\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nthat, like, you...\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nThey don't know why, but you're\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nhaving them repeatedly.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nRight, yeah. They keep happening.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nYeah, I keep having new aneurysms\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\ngrow,\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nand they can't figure out why, because\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nmostly it's a genetic thing.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nFor a guy my age, like, I was 28\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nwhen I had mine, and\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nthey were like, we can't even figure out\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nwhy this happened to you, because\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nyou know, it's a lot, the\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\npercentages higher in African-American men\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nthat age, or in women that\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nage, or everybody but\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nme, I guess, and so they couldn't figure out\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nwhy, and then they looked at my family history,\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nno one on my father's side, no one on my mother's\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nside, and so they're like, we\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\ndon't know what this is, we don't know if this is\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:40.000\nan evolution of what\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nhappens to aneurysms, we don't know what\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:44.000\nit is, but that's why they kind of\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\npoke and probe and study.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.000\nYeah, and the only silver lining\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nof that, with giant\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:52.000\nsix foot\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.000\nquotes around silver lining is that\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\nbecause they don't know what's going on, they're\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nactually giving you free treatment, because\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nthey're kind of guinea pigging you,\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nfiguring out what's going on. So you had one\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\naneurysm that actually exploded? Yeah,\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nruptured, and then they found\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nat Christmas time, last time I think\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nI spoke to you, and I was\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\npretty heartbroken, they found three more.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nThat's\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\na weak spot in the blood vessel, right?\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nExactly, yeah, it's almost\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nlike a clot in a way, but yeah,\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nit's weak tissue that's\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nthat might explode.\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nWhen they find them, then\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nare they able to do something? Yeah, yeah,\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nyou can do lasers, there's another\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\ncoiling type process, there's\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\na couple different options, but it's always good to\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\ncatch them, it's treatable\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nwhen you catch them. So,\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nthe most tragic thing, the thing that made Aaron\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nburst into tears up here hearing about it for five seconds\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nlast week, is\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nthis concept that\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nyour temporal lobe\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nwas flooded.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nYeah.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nOne thing that got wiped out was\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nyour visual memory, and you're\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nan artist.\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nEverything that you draw is affected\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nby the concept of visual memory\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nthat you can't, like,\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:06.000\nyou use the example of an apple\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:08.000\nin private conversation, right?\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:10.000\nWhen I close my eyes, I actually don't know\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nwhat you look like anymore.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nSo, when I wake up, I don't remember dreams,\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:16.000\nI don't have\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nknowledge of stuff. Don't close your eyes for a second.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nI look like you and McGregor.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\nJust roughly,\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nI mean, I do. I'm just\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nletting you know. Don't exploit him, Dan.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nI'm not capitalizing on anything, I'm just\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\njust clarifying for the audience.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nI don't know what he looks like right now.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nBut also, like, if you were going to...\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nYou assume that he would remember\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nyou and McGregor and not you.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nBut even worse than that,\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nlike, fundamentally,\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nyou might not know what an\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\napple looks like, right?\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nYeah. I mean, unless I'm holding it or looking at it.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nRight. So, you're seeing these things for first time.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nIt's total? It's 100%?\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nThere's no visual memory at all?\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\nNo, yeah. It's weird, because I'll see somebody\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nand I'll say hey to them and they'll go,\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nhow the hell does he remember me?\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:06.000\nI don't know. It's hard to explain. I don't remember\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nlike I ran into Anthony today\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nand I actually, it's...\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nand Spencer, and I knew who they were\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nbut I can't explain why. Through mannerism, maybe?\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nMaybe that, or someone was saying\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nabout energies, like, because I'm new\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nto that concept. Yeah, there's something about\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nface blindness, that people have...\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nLack of, there's a thing in the part of your brain that uses\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nvisual recognition. Yeah.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nAnd there are people that they've known for\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\ntheir entire lives and they have to reintroduce themselves\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nevery day to them. But... Yeah.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nLike, the cost that you had the other day\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nor the certain little signals... Yeah, talking helps.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nLike, if I hear someone talk enough, I'm like,\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nin another room, I'm like, oh, I know that's\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\nso-and-so. And you know it's Dan and I\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nbecause... And there's a person in your brain going,\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nthat's my uncle, that person\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nthat's talking in the other room. No, the family\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.000\nthing is the hardest, because most of my\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nactual memories and knowledge\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nof memories are...\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nthey go only back, like, five, six years.\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nRight. So, like, childhood, a lot of\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nstuff was wiped out. And you talked about\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nbeing down with your mom. I'm just going\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nall away, by the way. This is like...\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nYeah, I was like, I'll make a joke at something.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nNo, no, no, no. Don't worry about that.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nI was talking to you after the show last\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nweek and I just thought, like, what the fuck\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nare we doing with this podcast technology\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nfor not, like, it's not of any heroism\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\non my part of nobility. It's just thinking,\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nlike, what are we\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\ndoing? Like, this is\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nsomething that's not televisable because\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nit's not, like, who's going to tune in?\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nOh, I'd like to hear about this, but\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\nand yet it is mythologically, like,\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\nlike, like, like, like, like, this is\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:34.000\nwhat we all\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nare afraid of. You were\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nin a certain sense, like, more so than\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\nsomebody who's diagnosed with\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:42.000\noh, there's a\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:44.000\nmicroorganism that's eating away at\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nthis certain organ or something like that.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nThis is happening in your brain.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nIt's happening in your plumbing of your brain.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nAnd so\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nyou were talking about\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:56.000\nyou're sitting with\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\na scrapbook with your mom\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nlike a photo, photo scrapbook\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nand going through it with her and\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nyou, I mean, do you\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nwant to finish this?\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nYeah, I mean, well,\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:10.000\nwell, basically, I mean, on Aaron's\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nthing, it sucks\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:14.000\nbecause I actually don't like when\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:16.000\npeople cry. Right.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\nAnd it's a response I don't actually\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nhave a lot because there's some emotional damage too.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nWell, that was going to be my next question,\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nbut first of all, don't worry about us. That's why\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:26.000\nwe're up here. Actually, I don't want\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nlaughs. I just want a cathartic experience.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.000\nSure. Well, with Aaron, though, what I told her last week\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nwas I've been trying to find\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:34.000\na cheap way around the\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\ndrawing. So what I'll do is\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nI'll take a blue pencil and I'll just\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nkeep drawing shapes, you know, like circles\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nor whatever. And once it's\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nin a position to where I think\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:46.000\nthere's something there, I take a regular pencil\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nand go over it and then I've made, like, the side of a face\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:50.000\nand then I'll do more circles\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:52.000\nin blue and then I'll trace that again\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:54.000\nand it's weird. It's not\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.000\nfoolproof yet, but it's, like, I'm\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nI hate being told I can't.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nLike, my first doctors were like, you can't,\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nyou're not going to walk, you're not going to talk,\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.000\nand I'm like, bullshit, like, my life isn't going to\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:06.000\nbe in a wheelchair for\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nthe rest of my life. Like, I'm not going to just sit\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:10.000\nand be someone that my mom puts on the porch\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nto watch cars go by while she's at work,\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nyou know, like, I'm not just that.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\nI'm going to be something else. Like, if I'm\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\nnot going to be the old me, I'm going to be a new me,\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nyou know?\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:22.000\nAnd we've\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:24.000\nwe made you a t-shirt!\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:26.000\nYeah.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:28.000\nFor that reason.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nBut you talked about, like, going\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\ngoing through the photo album and\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\nand I mean, the thing that, like, made my heart\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:36.000\nlike, leap up into my throat\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:38.000\nor down into my groin or whatever\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:40.000\nit was that you said\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:42.000\nthe way I remember you saying it is\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nhaving the visual memory, you're going\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.000\nthrough a photo scrapbook with your mom\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:48.000\nand you're, and she's saying\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:50.000\nthis is, this is when we did this\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nand you're, and you're\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\nand you're basically having to take her word\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nfor it. Like, you know intellectually\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nthat she's your mom\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nbut you don't actually.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nRight, there's no reason.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nThe lowest-stakes con game in the world.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nThey're not getting away with\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\na lot.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.000\nIn their Swiss Bank account.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nBut even with your mother, you're seeing her\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.000\nfor the first time every time you see her\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nand it's simply memory.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\nThe visual memories of her.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:20.000\nIt's a lot of that.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nAnd so as you said, and you said\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:24.000\nlike, your life here in LA has span\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:26.000\nthe last five, six years.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:28.000\nSo I remember them knowledge-wise.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nLike, I know that I used to PA out here\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nbut I couldn't tell you visually\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\nwhat the person I PAed for looks like\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nbut I have the knowledge of it.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:38.000\nBut ironically, this horrible empty desert\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:40.000\nyou know, where we all come\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nto like, put our emotional lives on hold\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nwhile we try to get ahead in the world\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nof your cradle of memory.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nThis is as close as you have to home\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\nbecause this is the place you've been\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nfor six years.

luxury\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nof just not thinking about and lying at the bank\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nlike I was like oh shit I had a bad day today\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nyou know I

car's out of gas\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nthere's always\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:08.000\nthis like\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.000\nindependence day flying saucer\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nhovering in the sky\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nthat is\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\nblacking out the sun\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nbut completely ignorable\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nday to day for all of us\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nwhich is that we\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nlive minute to minute second to second\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nby the grace of some\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.000\ncompletely unforgiving\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nabsolutely inhuman thing\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.000\nand I just like\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:34.000\nwe just don't\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:36.000\nlike it's uncomfortable to ask people\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.000\nwho are further\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:40.000\nin the clutches of this thing\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\nfurther at its mercy in a demonstrable way\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nbut seems important to ask\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nlike what\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nwhat do we do\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nhow do we feel\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nhow do you feel\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nwhat message can you give to us\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nthat in any way\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nlets us stop fucking around\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nI don't know\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nI don't know\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\noh by the way a soul star\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nhas his powers on page one\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nnone of that page\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nso get your powers\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nbefore page 20\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nspeed it up hollywood\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nI don't know\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nthat\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:24.000\nthat I think resonates\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nso I tell people all the time\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:28.000\nit's just give more to the world\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:30.000\nthan what you take\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nthere's no right answer\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.000\nthere's no wrong answer\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:36.000\njust do what you love\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\nand don't hurt anyone it sounds generic\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nbut it's like\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nI'm not afraid of\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nif I don't wake up tomorrow\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nI still try to do\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\neverything I want to do in a day\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nand I just hope it's enough\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nand I think that's all\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.000\nany of us can do\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nthere's no\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nthere's no cosmic\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nright answer here\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nI think that was it\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.000\nI think that does it\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\ngive more than you take\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nthat absolutely has to be the answer\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nI know it's under all our noses\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nbut we don't believe it\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nwhen our mom says it\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nbecause she's in the kitchen making cookies\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nwe need heroes\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nto take the\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\ntrek and call back over their shoulder\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.000\nthis is the truth\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:26.000\nit was interesting\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nwhen you told me that last week\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nbecause I've heard people try to describe me\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nand normally I don't like it\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nwell you look like you and McGregor\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\njust so you know\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nI would love to see some of your art\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nis there a way that we can commission some\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nfor us\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\ncan you see something you draw\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\ncan we see like\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\nI want to see the blue test lines\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nthat are inked in later on\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.000\nthat sounds fascinating\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:56.000\nmy dad's a really good artist\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nI'd watch him draw\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nand he would draw a million lines really light\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\nand then he would hone in\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nand draw a line\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nso it was covered in lines\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nand then he would find it\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nthat's kind of in a way\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nmentally how I approach a lot of things\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nvisually that art approach\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nit's just trial by error\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nthe way I look at it is if I have to physically see something\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nto draw it\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nthen I'll just keep drawing it until it makes sense\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\nI tried looking at things\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:26.000\nand there seems to be a slight translation\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\ndisconnect\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nbut I'm getting better at it\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nif someone sat in front of me and I could draw their face\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nit would take a while\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nbecause I'm actually trying to use a part of the brain\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nthat isn't there anymore for me\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:40.000\nso you can feel it\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nbig time\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nI feel like the strain\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:46.000\nthat it's taking\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.000\nto transfer this to this\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:50.000\nwith nothing up here\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.000\nso if you wanted to draw something from memory\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:54.000\nsay you wanted to draw\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\na car or draw a banana\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:58.000\nor anything\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nthere's nothing you're conjuring up in your head\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nyou're waiting until you see it\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nand that reminds you of\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nI cheated\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\nrecently I have an art show downtown\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nand\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:12.000\nsomeone was standing near me\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\nand there was a draw\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\ngo over and draw on the wall\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nand I was looking at him and drawing\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:20.000\nand I just made him a zombie\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nas I'm doing the circles\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\na hole was in his cheek\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nso I drew a couple teeth there\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nbut I'm looking at him and doing it\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\nand someone was like oh my god you did it from memory\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nI don't know\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:34.000\nI felt so nice to hear that\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nI kind of lied\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:38.000\nand then I could just\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\nfeel like my old self again\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:42.000\nbut now what you're drawing is\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\nyou have to be\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nyou're forced to be totally in the moment\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:48.000\nyou're drawing something for the first time\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:50.000\nevery time so that's amazing\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:52.000\nsomething that can be really valuable\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:54.000\nand visceral\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\nto look at\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nyeah so what are you complaining about\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nyou've been giving this gift\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:02.000\nI know\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nwait people with any years of problems\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nI do I mean I've met people\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nwho\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nhave it much much worse\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nwho didn't get out of that world\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nis there a community out there?\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\noh yeah there's a great group at UCLA that meets\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\ntwice a month\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nand then there's a group on Facebook that I'm part of\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nthat we share our stories on there\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nand I go to\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nICUs and I meet people who have this\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nhowever going through it\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nI took some of their stories\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nand I put it in Soul Star\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\nit's a little bit more special\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nand then obviously I give all the proceeds\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\nto the aneurysm foundation\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.000\nbecause that's another way I just want to give back\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nand\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nagain just me trying to give more\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nI think\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nbefore I had my aneurysm\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.000\nI was probably the kind of guy that took enough\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nand so I kind of\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:54.000\nlook at this as a second chance\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nand people can google\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nthe aneurysm foundation if they wanted\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nto be inspired\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nby this podcast to put something into it\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nok well thank you so much Seek for coming up\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\nwe'll have you back\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:20.000\nI'm not a hugger\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nI don't hug people\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nenough we've hugged a couple times\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:26.000\nif anybody should be hugged they should hug Seek\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:28.000\nI didn't\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:30.000\nalright\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nI want to hug\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\neverybody in this room\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nalright well we're not going to\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nyou see why I flipped those segments\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nI didn't follow that with the complaining about the\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nvalet dollar\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nour next segment is called\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nmy favorite serials\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nI think Lucky Charms\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nis underrated\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:12.000\nI don't know\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.000\nwhat am I going to patent our podcast\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:16.000\non the back\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:20.000\nI feel the fidgeting\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nit's fucking hard to\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nI don't know\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nI watched\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nyou while you were talking\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nto Seek and also when you talk\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nto anybody about any kind of ailments\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nyou get really\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nphysically like you start pulling\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nyour hair out on top of your head\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nand you get a huge erection\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nit's not\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nit's not appropriate\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:46.000\nhuge is not the word I would have used\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:48.000\nyou're certainly around\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:50.000\nit's intense\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:52.000\nmy penis becomes\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nflushed\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.000\nwhat if you only got an actually huge erection\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\nwhen somebody else is in pain\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:00.000\nI think those people exist\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nthere's books about them\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nI was saying like\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\nwhat we were talking earlier about\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.000\nthe superpower of being deaf or blind\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nwe were talking about deafness and you were talking about\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nlike\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nwhat would it be like for you to be deaf\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nI had this weird empathetic\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nI'm not sure what the word is\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nI think when someone says they have a knee injury\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nmy knee hurts and if someone says they have a

01:08:16.000\nwhen I'll charge you $20\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000\na copy\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nI'm not kidding I don't know\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nwe can't go into that now it's $9.19\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000\n$9.19 is it\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nlet's just say it's very organic and very\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000\nprimal\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000\ntell us what happened last week at art\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000\ndoes everyone know what metagaming\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nis? not everyone knows\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nthat's a terrible question\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000\ndoes anybody by applause know what\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nmetagaming is?\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nJesus Christ\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nokay for everybody else in Dungeons and Dragons\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nsometimes the characters don't know stuff\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nthat the person who plays the character\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000\ndoes for instance if a character\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000\ncame up with what you in the real world\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nknow as a camera your character wouldn't\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nknow what a camera is because he's never seen one before\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000\neven though it's pretty regular technology right\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nso it would not make sense to be like\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000\noh that's a camera so that's metagaming\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nessentially there's different ways it comes out\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000\nanyway they were fighting a monster\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nit was a bed it was a sticky bed\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000\num\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nit was a bed\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nwhich everyone has knowledge of\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nbut it jumped around\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nit started sticking to people it was tackling folks\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000\num\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nand I let slip to Rob Schrobb\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nwho had his first edition\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nmonster manual that it was a monster in there\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nand I pointed it to him because I wanted some\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nnerd cred you know but that was\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nmy mistake and I caught\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nI caught you know I admit\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nfully to that that was terrible on my part\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nbut he showed you and then\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000\nyou tried to play it off like you were\n\n01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nuh like an old hand\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nwho's just like oh yeah a mimic\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000\nthat's what that is you know mimics\n\n01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nI didn't know this I wasn't trying to play anything\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000\noff I apologize that was the air I got\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000\nfrom you I really I thought that was\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000\nreally awesome I swear to god I wasn't\n\n01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000\ntrying to like deceive or anything\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000\nyeah no it's he didn't know anything\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000\nI thought what happened was granted\n\n01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000\nI'm very drunk during all of these\n\n01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000\nthings call call days\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000\ndays\n\n01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nI\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000\noh boy okay\n\n01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nwhen you were describing the monster Rob at the monster\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nmanual I thought that I knew\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000\nwhat it was I thought it was like like a\n\n01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000\ntrapper or something like that yeah something\n\n01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000\nlike like where it's like a carpet or\n\n01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000\nuh and I was like oh I think I think I know\n\n01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nwhat this is and I looked it up in the thing and\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000\nI noticed that hit the page that had the\n\n01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000\nsuccubus illustration was torn out of his\n\n01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nmonster manual\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nfor those of you\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000\nwho know what that means\n\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000\num but I was like oh shit\n\n01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000\nI don't think this is it\n\n01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nthen I diverted my attention\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000\nwas taken by booze and\n\n01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nand you know cake and whatever\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nthen at a certain point Rob\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nlike elbowed me and was pointing\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000\nat the mimic\n\n01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nI thought that\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000\nI didn't know that you had pointed at that\n\n01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000\nyeah no I know that definitely okay\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nI thought that Rob had found it\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nso that we I thought we were collectively\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nlike like oh if we\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nand in my day it was called table talk\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000\nand kind of game knowledge or whatever\n\n01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nboring conversation\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nyeah well in dance time it was the DM\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nversus the player so the DM would try to\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nfuck you up and then you'd have to look\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nat the monster manual to stand a chance\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000\nso it's kind of it makes sense\n\n01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000\nbut anyway the end result\n\n01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000\nwas he was like oh mimics are weak against\n\n01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000\nfood if you give him food he'll stop\n\n01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000\nfighting and um that's\n\n01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000\nthat like is kind of flagrant\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000\nover the line of metagaming so I was like\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nokay I gotta explain this concept\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000\nand I explained it very poorly\n\n01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nand um and then I think that\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nyou and Dan just thought I was trying to like\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000\npunish you but I was just trying to explain it\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nDan doesn't like being told like what to do\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000\nor that he did something wrong and he looked\n\n01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000\nat you the rest of the game we're just like\n\n01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nlike he wanted to stab your face\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nyou know come on\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nand uh and\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nbut his his hatred\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000\nof being told that he did something wrong\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000\nmet with his clear uh\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nrespect for what you do and who you are\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000\nand he just sat there looking like a little poopy bridges\n\n01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nbut there was\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nno way of knowing I wasn't doing it\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nto be punitive just to explain a concept\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000\nthat would have otherwise been hard to illustrate\n\n01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nwell easy real first of all\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000\nno one should be reading the monster manual during the game\n\n01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000\nthat's fine that's an easy real to understand\n\n01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nthen we get into this metagaming thing\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nand it's like the difference between metagaming\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000\nand what we used to call table talk\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000\nwhich is if I walk into a room\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000\nif you and I walk into a room and we see a troll\n\n01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000\nthat's holding a staff with a red ruby on the top of it\n\n01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000\nif I in all of my 20 years\n\n01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000\nof playing Dungeons & Dragons go\n\n01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000\noh that might be a fireball wand\n\n01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000\nlike maybe which I\n\n01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000\nlike is that metagaming\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nif I'm just talking to another player\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nI'm not saying to the other character\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000\nblah blah blah\n\n01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000\nso what I decided is\n\n01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nI'm just going to be immersed in my character\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000\nall the time that way I'll never\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nbe at risk of metagaming\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000\nbut that scenario you explained wasn't\n\n01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nmetagaming like table talk can still happen\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000\nit just can't like\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000\ninexplicably cross the bound then your character\n\n01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000\nwould have to be like oh\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000\na wand of thing like I saw\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000\nthat dude shooting fireballs out of earlier\n\n01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000\nthen it would make sense that your character would know\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000\nbut if you're like oh that's a wand of fireball\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nbecause my player who plays me knows\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nI still don't get it though\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nyou just confused me again because if I say to another player\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nif I haven't done anything\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nI say to another player oh that might be a\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nwand of fireballs if we don't\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000\noutside of your character\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nthat's metagaming you shouldn't do\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nno that's not metagaming that's just talking\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000\nwait no I'm confused\n\n01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000\nokay metagaming only pertains to your\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000\ncharacter actions\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000\nso anything you Jeff does is fine\n\n01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000\noh but we can do sidebars with each other\n\n01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nand say I think it sounds like a thing\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nyeah but then your character would have to\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000\ncome up with an in-character reason to be taking\n\n01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nthat course of action well I think you'll find\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000\nif you look back\n\n01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000\nthat I have never metagamed\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000\nand but I\n\n01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000\nwill be in character if I agree\n\n01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000\notherwise you're fired\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000\nyou know when I was agreeing with you\n\n01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000\nin the writers room I actually did agree\n\n01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000\nI wasn't just trying to grease things along\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000\nyou were right in that instance\n\n01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000\nsorry I want this is exciting\n\n01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000\nI want your relationship business-wise\n\n01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000\nand friendship-wise to go so far\n\n01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000\nthat one day he just supplants you\n\n01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000\nwhere he'd be too\n\n01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000\nthat's called an apprenticeship\n\n01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000\nbut you have to be allowed to let that happen\n\n01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000\nand I know you
