00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
From the Nerdist Theater at Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California,

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
Harmontown is in session. Please welcome the mayor of Harmontown,

00:17.000 --> 00:35.000
Dan Harmon.

00:35.000 --> 00:51.000
Alright, we got a lot to do. Quit fucking around.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Alright, I'm out of breath. Just give me a second.

00:56.000 --> 01:08.000
This is the definition of what is aerobic exercise because so close to what is walking as you get older and older.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
I want to start very quickly with a segment that's a favorite for everyone.

01:14.000 --> 01:25.000
It's called Things that Dan Harmon is not allowed to complain about because it makes him sound like an asshole.

01:25.000 --> 01:37.000
These are the things that when I complain about them reveal that I'm a narcissistic rich prick with a lower value system than people in Lebanon.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
I am a stupid fucking asshole.

01:40.000 --> 01:48.000
Alright, so you're not allowed to judge me because I said that.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
Okay, so I valet parked my car constantly, even if I don't have to.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
I'll just find someone to valet my car. There will be a parking space.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
I'm like, that's not good enough. That's not true.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
I'm actually kind of annoyed with the fact that in LA there's valet.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
There will be a parking lot and it's empty.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
And then there's a guy in front that's like, I'm valeting your car and it makes me mad.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
Oh shit, seat now. I got a new note-taking app.

02:18.000 --> 02:25.000
It's called Cat Catch. Everybody just fucking cool it.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
We're going to get through this. We got a lot of shit to do tonight.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Item number one, Things that I'm not allowed to complain about because it'll make me sound like an asshole.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
I pull up to the valet.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
One point A is your new application on your phone, your new note app.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah, it's not Evernote anymore. Fuck you, Evernote.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
So I pull up to the guy at the valet station and this is happening now with increasing frequency

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
as I have more and more to do and more and more sort of liquid assets, I would say, I would call it.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
I'll get out at the valet station and the guy will go, are you eating here?

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
He'll give me a half of his little Terry card and I'll go, yes.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
And then he'll start to get in the car and I'll go, sir, sir, sir.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
I have to come back now. Already the purpose of the valet is starting to be defeated.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
Time is running out. I got Zoe Deschanels to have lunch with.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
That's not true.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
But then the guy says, sir, sir, sir, sir. There's a dollar on the floor of the car.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
I don't care. It costs $7 to park here. I'm going to tip you three and you asshole.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Take the dollar.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
All right, moving on.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Yes, of course, there's a dollar on the floor of my car.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
It's called garbage. The economy's in the toilet.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Just put your gum in it, valet man.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
It's a dollar. We're all dying.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
A dollar. I got to come back. What am I supposed to do?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Because he gives me the choice between coming back and grubbing for my dollar

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
or going like Tom Cruise and some weird man.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
It's yours.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Calling over my shoulder. Keep it, man.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Okay, let's say it's a 20.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
I think that's cool. Yeah, it's 20 times a dollar. Don't argue with me. We don't have any time.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
All right, next item.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Things I can't, I'm not allowed to complain about. This one, it takes too long to poop.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
We can just move on. It just takes too long to poop.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
And I don't mean because I'm 40, but just because, well, it is because I'm 40,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
because as you get to 40, time becomes more valuable.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
So see the valet guy. Same thing. I'm becoming conscious of my mortality.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I don't want to, I have to take a shit. I get it, God.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I got to poop to put in the toilet. I just want to get it done.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
And it's just like I'm sort of sitting there and I'm like, come on, poop.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Are your poops longer than when you were younger? Are they getting older?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
No, no, no. I've always been, this is one thing I've always been really good at.

05:08.000 --> 05:16.000
I can debate that right there because you gave yourself a hemorrhoid by sitting on the toilet too long.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
No, because I love to sit on the phone and I, but okay, that's the point,

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
is that the doctor told me, like, don't tweet on the toilet.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
I didn't know this was a thing and so I was like, okay, I'll stop doing that.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I used to enjoy my time on the toilet. This is, thank you, Jeff.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
This is exactly why I'm starting to notice. It takes too long to poop

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
because now I'm not allowed to do other stuff on the toilet. Thank you.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
If I can't do anything but poop, then poop faster.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
But, okay. Superhero movies need earlier thresholds.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Need earlier thresholds.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Minute 20 into your movie called Captain America.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
A comic book no one likes anyway.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
I don't, I want to see his fucking round shield flying around.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
You can't say on page 70, oh, look at that shield.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Maybe that should be red, white and blue.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
Fuck you, Captain America movie. Fuck you, Superman movie.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Fuck you, Hulk movie, whichever third version it was.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Like, fuck you, superhero movie, Green Lantern.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
Fuck you. Like, stop, speed it up. You're a superhero movie.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
I bought a ticket because I already accept that a guy can get a wooba from the planet Booba

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
and as a result, he's allowed to fooba.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
No one fucking cares? What are you trying? What are you making on Golden Pond? You fucking assholes?

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
Knock it off. Knock it off. In and out. 90 minutes.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
Page 20. I'm foobo-ing.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
I don't fucking care. Name a thing. Name a noun.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Somebody say it. Tooba man. Okay.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Page 20 is playing the tuba, okay?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
And using it to fight crime.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
I don't mean like, he's got a trumpet and he's like, this should be bigger.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Fucking page 20 of your screenplay.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
Tuba in his mouth blasting, like, radioactive rainbow waves out at a burglar going like,

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
oh shit, I'm robbing a bank, but now I can't because the tuba man.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
Because the movie's called Tuba Man is why.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
That's the thing. You can't charge me a ticket.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
I have a right to ask for my money back if half the movie's a guy thinking maybe he should

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
maybe kind of fight something with crime involved.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
There's something involving a tuba. Fuck you.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
I said, Captain America's walking around forever in that movie.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
He's like, just dressed as a silly guy.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I just wish I could fight some Nazis.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Fucking cock.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
It'd be one thing if you were a Spider-Man and you pulled that shit.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
You're Captain America. You're a dick.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Iron Man.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I think you're allowed to complain about that.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
You are allowed to complain about that.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, I'm 40, so it makes me sound like a knob.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
I should be putting more thought into Cambodia and things like that.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
What's going on in Cambodia?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Well, when I was 10, some stuff.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
That's my point. That's my point.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
I don't know what the new Cambodia is.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I should.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Well, while I'm on the subject, Iron Man should be an alcoholic in the movies.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
In the comic book, he's an alcoholic and it's fucking amazing.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
That's the important thing about him. Batman's parents got killed.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Fine. That's great. I love Batman.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Spider-Man's like a young naive kid who's like,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
he got this responsibility thrust upon him.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
He's a wisecracker. The whole point of Iron Man,

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
he's the Howard Hughes of superheroes and he's got a drinking problem.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
That's it. But he's good at his shit. He's a functional alcoholic.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
What's kryptonite? He's so good at drinking.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
People are like, holy shit, we can't fire him. He drinks too much.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
He gets work done while he's doing it.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
So it's you?

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
Well, I like all of these superheroes for various reasons.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
You, as a 40-year-old, want your superhero fantasy

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
is that you can be a functional alcoholic and still fight crime.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
That ain't no fantasy, Jack.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
What crime are you fighting?

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
The crime of people not respecting me.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I often lose.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
All right. That brings me to my next point.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Jeff, thank you for your unintentional segue.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
It's just all instinctual for me, Dan.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
All right. My next complaint on the list of things

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
I'm not allowed to complain about because they make me seem like an asshole.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I'm too famous.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Let's just move on. Let's just move on.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Next item. I apologize too much.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm sick of it. I'm tired of...

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I'm 40 years old.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
I just want to cut my head open and pour the contents of my brain out.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
The idea of an apology is that you clarify to somebody

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
that you didn't mean to hurt their feelings.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
I am the only one who you can actually go and find out whether or not,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
like what I really meant.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
It's not fair. I'm sick of it.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I'm not a fucking politician. I didn't run for office.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
I'm not accountable to electors.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
I stand in front of a microphone. I puke my brains out.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I have diarrhea of the mouth.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
I say for two hours a week how I feel.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I'm honest about my emotions.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
People that don't like me, I don't like you. I hate you.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Your piece is a shit.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Your dishonest fucking agents of caution and restraint.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
You want people to talk less. You want people to be more like ants.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I fucking hate you.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
I will apologize to you in a cautious, fucking, like, détente,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
like a ceasefire.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
You're bad people and I don't care if you don't like me anymore.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Your piece is a shit. Fuck off.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Next item on my list.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Again, you can't argue with this stuff,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
because I'm admitting to you this makes me a bad person

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
for having these complaints.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Next item. Everyone in the world is stupid.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Everybody.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Maybe including me. Time will tell.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I don't care. Moving on.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
There's no good bar near meltdown.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
There's nothing. There's no place to drink.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Panky can take a fuck.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I didn't go today.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I can't take it anymore.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I can't go sit over there.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Maria Conchita Alonso, what's it called? El Compadre?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Yes.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I can't drink there.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
It turns into a sports bar after 3 p.m.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I don't know what accounting firm is above it,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
but it just gets flooded with J. Moore clones.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
Everyone's snapping and tapping quarters on the bar,

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
and they want their Apple Teenies and their Marga Fooders.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
I can't sit down and have a drink.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
What do we think bars are for? What are we doing?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
You come into a bar with a group of people

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
that you want to talk to from work, go get a fucking table.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
There are some of us in this world that are really, really...

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
We have a disease. I just want to go up to a trough,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
and I want to make eye contact.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I want to plot my ass down on a stool,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
and I need my fucking spinach slash kryptonite.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
I need it pumped into my body at a certain rate,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
and I can't give these people what they want.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
That's it.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
We got through that.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Our next segment.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I promised we'd bring it back.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Is Connor here?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Questions with Connor.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
You have another question, Connor?

12:53.000 --> 13:00.000
Questions with Connor.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Welcome back, Connor.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Thank you, Jeff.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Last week, Connor brought us a tantalizing question

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
of whether it's better to teleport or to have sex.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I don't know that we totally got to the bottom of that.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Who knows? That's the point of the question.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
The question was the journey.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Connor's conundrums.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Did you make a decision?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I don't know. It sounded like Aaron would be cool

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
with me not coming.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
I'd like to travel.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
I think I would go teleportation ultimately.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
There was a twist at the very end

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
where you started talking about

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
how you would have the drive to orgasm,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
but not the ability.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
We could play with that. You could choose.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Can I play with it?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
No drive.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
No drive and teleportation?

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
I don't want to walk around. If you don't have a desire to,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
then there's no point.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
If you have a human desire to enjoy sex,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
you get the finish line, buddy.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I'm just saying.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
You changed your answer?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I thought the curse was that you'd want to,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
but you couldn't.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
You were too busy going to Paris.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Glasses guy?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
If you don't have a biological imperative to,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
but you remember it fondly,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
or...

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
So you just stand up and face everybody right now,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
just so you can see what I'm looking at,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
what you're doing.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Describe him, Jeff.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
There's a sub-segment called Jeff's Descriptions.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
There's a six-foot, what are you, four?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Six-five gentlemen with a mohawk,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
and a proper mohawk,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
where it needs to be a long word out of B.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
He's not that mad at the Queen.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
No.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
He still minds the bollocks.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
But he lives in Parliament.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Yeah.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
He's also wearing one of the...

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
At my podium here, I have a pair of

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Louvert 80s hot pink sunglasses here.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
You brought these.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
That doesn't surprise me one bit.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
It's Tyler, right?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
So Tyler, I see a lot of people out here

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
wearing 80s novelty sunglasses.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
And, okay, so now you've been described.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Yes.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
All right, there we go.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Sub-section. Jeff describes people.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
What was your point? I'm sorry.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
So you can go sex or teleportation.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
You say you wouldn't have the drive for it.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
So you wouldn't have a biological drive for it,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
but you still remember fondly the times

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
that you did have sex in the past.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
The nostalgia thing, but not a biological one.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah, but that's not.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
When I want to have sex,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
it's not because I remember it being awesome.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
That's absolutely...

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
If you could just take away the...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
If you could turn it off.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
If he has teleportation and unfair advantage,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
because if you can still have sex,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
you still have to have the urge to teleport.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Yeah.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Okay, but we've tabled this one

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
because now we have a new Connor...

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Yes, all right.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Tony, teleportation.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Connor Conundrum coming through.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Connor Conundrum, what about you?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Ask yourself this question

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
and you will find...

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I teleport to a time

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
when that song

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
sounds like...

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
It's like,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I teleport to a time

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
when that song made sense.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Bad theme song, Bad Evening.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Teleport to a time?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
You can't teleport to a time.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Goddamn, that's right, I keep thinking time travel.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
All right, I'm sorry.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Connor, what is your new conundrum for us this week?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Okay, really quick, did we cheer alcoholism

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
a few minutes ago?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Yeah,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
when a comic book character

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
that can make a jet suit has it,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
that's amazing.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Let's make sure we're on the same page.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
All right, this is my question this week.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
If you had to choose between

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
gaining flight

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
but losing your sight so you become blind,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
or every time you fart

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
you accidentally time travel?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Which would you choose?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Wait,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I have 14 questions.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
You can fly but you can't see.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Yes.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Or a bat.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Or a bat.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Are you a bat?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Do you have a sonar?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I'm sorry, Connor, just to clarify.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Are you blind only while you're flying?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
No, you're blind all the time.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Oh, go fuck yourself.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I'm going to fart.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I'm going to fart accidentally on time travel.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Yeah, I'm immediately on hold

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
for the farting time travel.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
There's ways you can hold your fart

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
and explain to people

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
like a new relationship.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Sweetie, there's something you have to know about me.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
You may never see me again.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
You're talking about your maiden

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
in like medieval times because this has already happened before.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
All right, what's the range of time travel?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
You could end up in a lava pit.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Well, I guess you could

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
you'd travel from the spot you're in

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
or not?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I mean, maybe this is a curse.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Since everyone farts sooner or later

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
and since time travel is just going to take you

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
to some random place and they're

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
completely destabilized your life and since

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
well, no, no, fuck you because

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
like, I'm starting to get so angry at you.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
But you're saying I have to be blind.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Well, I think what this one is,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
this is not what cool thing would I pick.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
These are, I'm choosing between two curses here.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Right.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Which they can have incentives, but

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
it's not as...

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah, because the whole point of flight is that you would see the vistas for me,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
that you could, you know, you could fly around.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Well, that's where you're going.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I'm not going to leave the ground if I can't see.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Yeah, but are you a bat?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Do you have that kind of sound

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
location kind of thing?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I don't think so, but when you lose a sense,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
aren't there other senses heightened?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Yeah, but over millennia of

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
evolution.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
If you gave me the blind flight, I'd fly into a thing.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Okay, what if you were only blind

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
when you flew?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Connor, you had a week to figure this out.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
No time to workshop.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Okay, if you're only blind

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
when you fly, then I'll take the blindness

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
because the uncontrollability

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
of the...

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
at the root of it all is my control issues.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Like, if I'm just farting

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
and I'm randomly time traveling,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I can neither control farting

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
nor where I go when I fart

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
and when I come back and stuff.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Like, if you told me, okay, for instance,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
if you take the blindness,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
if you make it, when you fly

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
you're blind, but when you're not flying

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
you're not blind, and also

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
when you fart

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
you time travel to somewhere random

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
but

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
the next time you fart, you come back.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Okay, that's a good twist.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Then I'll take farting because nobody double

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
farts like

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Vitamin H over here.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
What if you triple fart?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Then you go...

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Somewhere new. Then you reject the record.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I don't know.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
If you fart an odd number of farts,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
you could be the place to see.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
But then you find some beans

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
in the place to see, and you...

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
The place to see an error had no beans

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
then. There's other things that make you

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
fart just. How do you know?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I talk to a dinosaur.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Blind flying!

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
How do you land when you're blind flying?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
How do you know when you want to fucking settle down?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I mean, do you just hover down really

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
cautiously? These are questions that you should have

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
asked yourself.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It's a good choice, though, because

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
you're in an alleyway and muggers

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
are coming down.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
This always happens.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And they're like, we're going to cut you wide open,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
sucker!

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
They're white.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
It's just an

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
urban environment. Everyone talks like this.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
We're going to cut you from

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
groin to loin!

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Which isn't that far, but it might get your femoral

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
artery.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You can bleed out, sucker!

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
We want your wallet, sucker!

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And then you're at this dead-end alley

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
and you're like, so then

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
with your vision still intact, you look around.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
You look up

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
and you go like, okay.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
That's a fact. And then you go like,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
okay, blind

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
flight, give me a flight beyond

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
sight!

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
At least you're not getting your wallet

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
taken, sucker.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
And then you move like eight feet

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
to the left and you're like, you come down

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
super slow.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
We have to page 20 of blind flights.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
How do you get us to that question?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
That's what happens on page 20.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
What leads him up to that?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
What gives him that?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
The doctor is a blind guy and he goes like,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I think we could give you your sight back.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
But you'd have to fly.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
But without sight.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
And the blind guy's like, okay.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
I don't know. Don't ask me to

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
write movies for free for you people.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
You always do that.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
We got mohawk guys

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
raising his hand again.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
If you could see while you're flying,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
you were blind all the rest of the time.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Ooh!

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
He's saying, what if you're just

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
an operational blind man,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
a woman walking down the road.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
But if you wanted to, you could fly and see.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I think we'd all take that, right?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
And then to counterbalance that,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
you'd have to be time traveling only when you were not farting.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Sorry.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Sorry.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I wanted to go to Mexico,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
but...

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
You're like Billy Pilgrim and catch 22.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Slaughterhouse 5.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
You're like, you have no control over

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
when you're going, coming and going.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Unless you're farting and then you can love a woman.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
All right.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
That's enough. We got a lot to do tonight.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Ask yourself that conundrum at home.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Send us your picture pages about it.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And we'll talk to other guests tonight

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
about whether or not they would fart or blind fly.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Connor, will you come back next week with one more?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Absolutely.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Connors conundrums, everybody!

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
It brings to mind that conundrum,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
would you like to have Connors conundrums every week,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
or eat a bag of jelly beans?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Look, I would say,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
and I support what he's doing here,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I like the idea that it's...

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
this time was a choice between

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
two not so attractive ideas.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Right, they both had a price.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
A real conundrum is, which is the lesser of two

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
crappy superpowers?

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Well, let me ask you a very basic thing.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Would you rather be blind or deaf?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Deaf.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Because of the internet.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
For real?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
No, because in case I learn how to fly.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Because...

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I'd rather see than hear.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I get more irritated by things I hear

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
than things I see.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I'm not constantly wishing,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
if I could just choose where I could hear,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
or I never wish I could see

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
something different that I'm seeing.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
You can always avert your eyes.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
It's a really tough choice for me,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
because even though we're 90% visually oriented,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
but it's that connection

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
that we have between people

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
that's really packed into the hearing,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
but the internet changes that.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
You can connect to people with the...

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
And you're a writer, you can still tell stories.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
You can't hear shit,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
get a good night's sleep,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
and just type on the...

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Just go on Reddit.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
If I'm in a bar or restaurant,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
sometimes it's not the noise.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It's the bar tappers, the guys that drum on bars.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
You can't just hear it.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
It also has a physical vibration to it.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Now I'm nervous like you, you fucking piece of shit.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Stop drumming on that.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
It's a very isolating

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
condition.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Deafness though.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I remember reading that thing,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
that more Deaf people

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
commit suicide than

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
the blind people,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
because they're cut off from that.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
They just...

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
You know,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
blind people,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
deaf communities,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
they have...

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
There's a sort of...

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
They have communities where they're against

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
cochlear implants and stuff,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
because they're effectively a different...

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I don't know if they'd say

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
species, but they're saying...

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
We are so different from

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
other people that we actually need to

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
stay together, because other people don't treat us

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
right, and we don't...

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
No one understands what it's like to be us,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
and so they stick together,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
and they actually

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
kind of... They look at people

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
who go in and get those

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
cochlear implants or whatever they're called.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Like, oh,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
you're not one of us then, because we don't...

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
And I'm not saying if you're deaf and you're

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
reading a transcript of this...

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
That's not funny.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
If you're deaf and you're

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
reading a transcript of this, I apologize for the bracketed

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
laughter that just happened.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
But, you know,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I'm not saying... There's a million kinds

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
of deaf people, but... I think you actually...

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I'm not joking. You might have changed my mind.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I might go back to that. And it's an intense thing

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
to be cut off

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
from people on that fundamental level.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Like, it's easy

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
for us to imagine what it would be like to cut off

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
from vision, in that it would be catastrophic

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
for us, and yet it would be so much more

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
fundamental.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Vision is just like, oh, god, I'd trip over

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
my ottoman, but hearing is like,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
oh, my god, I will never

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
hear another person again. I will never...

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I don't know. Something to think about.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
It's like, Connor, I had an easier

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
cut-under menu.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Before I answer your question,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
there's something like...

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Erin was saying that you guys want to travel

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
again, but you don't like traveling to places

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
that don't speak English. It's true.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
You'd prefer to be somewhere that was English

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
speaking. Yeah. Because you're a verbal

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
communicator.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
So deafness would be harder

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
on you. I'd be more nervous about it.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I mean, I would definitely be a shut-in if I was

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
deaf. More so than I think

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
if I was blind, like, I would be

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
a shut-in.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Like, maybe that's an unhealthy phrase

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
for it, but I would just

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
close myself in.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Because I would just be communicating

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
purely through

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
the internet with other people,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
and I would just kind of want to

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
build on that, I think.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
What were you going to say? Would you rather be deaf

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
at birth or lose your hearing

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
as a teenager and know what you're missing?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Deaf at birth or lose your hearing

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
as a teenager? And know

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
what you're missing? Yeah.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
See, Connor, that's how it's done.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
No, come on.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
We bullied him.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Connor's deaf. He can't hear us.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
That was my point. I wanted to reveal

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
it to you guys that Connor was deaf.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
All right. Well, I don't know.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I mean, good question, buddy. Good job.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
You're

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
metals in the mail. We're done with the segment.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
All right.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
We've got a lot of stuff to do. What would you

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
pick? Who would you pick, Viking?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
guess at birth.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I feel like it would be

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
lonelier to know what you're missing.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
I think that's probably true, yeah.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
At birth, he said.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I think I'd go for that as well. I assume so.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
I mean, what's the, yeah, what is the value

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
of having something and having it taken away?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
What about, okay, I'm making one up here.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
What if you could, you have the choice between

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
between being deaf at birth

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
but you could fly

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
when you turn

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
40.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
But you're an alcoholic.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Made of iron.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Or I

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
was the opposite of that one.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
But here I am. Everyone you talk to

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
turns blind.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
But you can tunnel

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
to the center of the earth and not get burnt by the magma.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Until you're 40.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
At which point you have to

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
drink magma in order to do a show.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
All right.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Think about it.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
We have a special guest tonight.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
He was actually briefly up here, like a meteor

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
flashing before you.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Like a superhero flying through the sky.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
We want to bring him up again

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
because we barely graze the surface

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
and we're not doing it

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
because we, I don't know.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I'm not Tony Danza.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
I'm not bringing up people with recipes.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I figure the podcast technology

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
is for

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
doing stuff you can't do on TV.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And one of those things is that kind of

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
laying humanity bare.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And one of the craziest things

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
about humanity, one of the biggest elephants

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
in the room is

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
sickness, mortality, conditions,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
you know, like the stuff that we

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
fear the most.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
And there are people among us who are

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
tethered to us with a rope

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
and are hanging out

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
on the precipice of these things that we

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
kind of like,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
we fear so much that we

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
don't even, it's just more convenient

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
not to think about them.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
And you would think that would not make for good podcast material.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
But I have a feeling

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
that it's really important to talk to this guy.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
You saw him last week.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Let's bring Seek Donnelly up here.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
How are you doing? You said

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
you had a rough night, but you were

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
cool to come in today. Yeah, can I stand?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What happens when you sit?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Honestly,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
I was in a wheelchair for a long time.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
So when I was learning to walk again.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
So I have this, when I sit for too

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
long, I freak out. Oh my god.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
So you had to re-learn how

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
to walk after the, okay, so

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
let's explain from the top. So

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Seek, you, one

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
day you had an aneurysm, which is

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
an explosion in the brain.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Yeah, I was wiping

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
my butt at LAX with the door open.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Good one.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
You can still do, it didn't wipe out the callback part.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
No, we were just

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
walking.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
I went to dinner with some friends.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I was complaining about a migraine.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I've had migraines since I was eight years old.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
So we didn't think anything

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
was different about it.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
And then we were going out for the night,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
and then I just dropped to the ground.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
You just fell down at LAX or somewhere else?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
No, no, no, no, just, yeah, back home.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Just at your house?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Was it, did you feel pain

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
when you fell down? I don't remember

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
any of it. I barely

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
remember waking up in the hospital,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
and then the doctor apparently

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
talked to me and said, you know,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
there's some complications with what's going on

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
to you. We need to put you in a medically induced coma.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
We don't know for how long.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Which means they give you drugs that

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
just make you unconscious for a while? I'm just gone.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Yeah, for 11 days I was out.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I was only supposed to be out for six or seven days,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
but then there was another complication.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I flatlined, and then

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
they saved me, and then

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
I was in for another five days.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
So during this medically induced coma,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
they studied your brain a little bit

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
enough to tell you what had happened?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Well, yeah, well, and while I was under,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
they also did a couple procedures to save

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
my life. So they did a

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
process called coiling, which is

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
they actually don't go through your

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
brain to do this. It's going to sound weird.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
They make an incision in your leg,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
and they go straight up to your brain,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
and they put these coils,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
and these coils are like little copper tubes

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
that, you know, when an aneurysm happens,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
blood is pouring all over your brain,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
and so everything, the

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
blood touches, it's destroying,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
and so these coils go in, and they

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
reroute the blood, so that it's not...

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
How do they get a coil

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
from your leg to your brain?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
How does it follow any

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
path?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Okay, good. You're not the guy to ask.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
We'll have a doctor on our team.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
I'll bring my doctor when they...

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
To interject at this point,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
like, this is...

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I'm sure I speak for most people

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
in the audience, like,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
even beyond,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I think, getting

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
certain types of cancer or something.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
This represents, like,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
a worst nightmare, because

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
it's so

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
uncontrollable. It's just, you're

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
just suddenly told, you're walking along,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
everything's going fine, you

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
black out, you wake up in a hospital,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
and they're telling you, yeah, a thing

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
is happening, and then it gets

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
worse, because now you've been told

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
that, like, you...

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
They don't know why, but you're

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
having them repeatedly.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Right, yeah. They keep happening.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah, I keep having new aneurysms

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
grow,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
and they can't figure out why, because

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
mostly it's a genetic thing.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
For a guy my age, like, I was 28

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
when I had mine, and

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
they were like, we can't even figure out

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
why this happened to you, because

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
you know, it's a lot, the

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
percentages higher in African-American men

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
that age, or in women that

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
age, or everybody but

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
me, I guess, and so they couldn't figure out

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
why, and then they looked at my family history,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
no one on my father's side, no one on my mother's

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
side, and so they're like, we

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
don't know what this is, we don't know if this is

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
an evolution of what

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
happens to aneurysms, we don't know what

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
it is, but that's why they kind of

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
poke and probe and study.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Yeah, and the only silver lining

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
of that, with giant

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
six foot

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
quotes around silver lining is that

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
because they don't know what's going on, they're

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
actually giving you free treatment, because

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
they're kind of guinea pigging you,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
figuring out what's going on. So you had one

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
aneurysm that actually exploded? Yeah,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
ruptured, and then they found

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
at Christmas time, last time I think

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I spoke to you, and I was

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
pretty heartbroken, they found three more.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
That's

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
a weak spot in the blood vessel, right?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Exactly, yeah, it's almost

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
like a clot in a way, but yeah,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
it's weak tissue that's

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
that might explode.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
When they find them, then

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
are they able to do something? Yeah, yeah,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
you can do lasers, there's another

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
coiling type process, there's

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
a couple different options, but it's always good to

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
catch them, it's treatable

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
when you catch them. So,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
the most tragic thing, the thing that made Aaron

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
burst into tears up here hearing about it for five seconds

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
last week, is

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
this concept that

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
your temporal lobe

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
was flooded.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Yeah.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
One thing that got wiped out was

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
your visual memory, and you're

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
an artist.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Everything that you draw is affected

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
by the concept of visual memory

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
that you can't, like,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
you use the example of an apple

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
in private conversation, right?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
When I close my eyes, I actually don't know

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
what you look like anymore.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
So, when I wake up, I don't remember dreams,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I don't have

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
knowledge of stuff. Don't close your eyes for a second.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I look like you and McGregor.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Just roughly,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I mean, I do. I'm just

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
letting you know. Don't exploit him, Dan.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I'm not capitalizing on anything, I'm just

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
just clarifying for the audience.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I don't know what he looks like right now.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
But also, like, if you were going to...

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
You assume that he would remember

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
you and McGregor and not you.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Oh, yeah.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
But even worse than that,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
like, fundamentally,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
you might not know what an

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
apple looks like, right?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Yeah. I mean, unless I'm holding it or looking at it.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Right. So, you're seeing these things for first time.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
It's total? It's 100%?

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
There's no visual memory at all?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
No, yeah. It's weird, because I'll see somebody

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
and I'll say hey to them and they'll go,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
how the hell does he remember me?

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I don't know. It's hard to explain. I don't remember

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
like I ran into Anthony today

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
and I actually, it's...

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
and Spencer, and I knew who they were

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
but I can't explain why. Through mannerism, maybe?

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Maybe that, or someone was saying

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
about energies, like, because I'm new

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
to that concept. Yeah, there's something about

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
face blindness, that people have...

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Lack of, there's a thing in the part of your brain that uses

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
visual recognition. Yeah.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
And there are people that they've known for

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
their entire lives and they have to reintroduce themselves

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
every day to them. But... Yeah.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Like, the cost that you had the other day

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
or the certain little signals... Yeah, talking helps.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Like, if I hear someone talk enough, I'm like,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
in another room, I'm like, oh, I know that's

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
so-and-so. And you know it's Dan and I

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
because... And there's a person in your brain going,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
that's my uncle, that person

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
that's talking in the other room. No, the family

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
thing is the hardest, because most of my

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
actual memories and knowledge

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
of memories are...

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
they go only back, like, five, six years.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Right. So, like, childhood, a lot of

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
stuff was wiped out. And you talked about

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
being down with your mom. I'm just going

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
all away, by the way. This is like...

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Yeah, I was like, I'll make a joke at something.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
No, no, no, no. Don't worry about that.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I was talking to you after the show last

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
week and I just thought, like, what the fuck

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
are we doing with this podcast technology

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
for not, like, it's not of any heroism

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
on my part of nobility. It's just thinking,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
like, what are we

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
doing? Like, this is

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
something that's not televisable because

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
it's not, like, who's going to tune in?

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Oh, I'd like to hear about this, but

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
and yet it is mythologically, like,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
like, like, like, like, like, this is

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
what we all

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
are afraid of. You were

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
in a certain sense, like, more so than

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
somebody who's diagnosed with

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
oh, there's a

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
microorganism that's eating away at

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
this certain organ or something like that.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
This is happening in your brain.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
It's happening in your plumbing of your brain.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
And so

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
you were talking about

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
you're sitting with

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
a scrapbook with your mom

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
like a photo, photo scrapbook

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
and going through it with her and

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
you, I mean, do you

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
want to finish this?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Yeah, I mean, well,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
well, basically, I mean, on Aaron's

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
thing, it sucks

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
because I actually don't like when

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
people cry. Right.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
And it's a response I don't actually

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
have a lot because there's some emotional damage too.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Well, that was going to be my next question,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
but first of all, don't worry about us. That's why

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
we're up here. Actually, I don't want

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
laughs. I just want a cathartic experience.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Sure. Well, with Aaron, though, what I told her last week

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
was I've been trying to find

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
a cheap way around the

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
drawing. So what I'll do is

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I'll take a blue pencil and I'll just

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
keep drawing shapes, you know, like circles

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
or whatever. And once it's

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
in a position to where I think

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
there's something there, I take a regular pencil

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
and go over it and then I've made, like, the side of a face

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
and then I'll do more circles

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
in blue and then I'll trace that again

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
and it's weird. It's not

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
foolproof yet, but it's, like, I'm

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
I hate being told I can't.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Like, my first doctors were like, you can't,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
you're not going to walk, you're not going to talk,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
and I'm like, bullshit, like, my life isn't going to

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
be in a wheelchair for

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
the rest of my life. Like, I'm not going to just sit

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
and be someone that my mom puts on the porch

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
to watch cars go by while she's at work,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
you know, like, I'm not just that.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I'm going to be something else. Like, if I'm

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
not going to be the old me, I'm going to be a new me,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
you know?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
And we've

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
we made you a t-shirt!

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Yeah.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
For that reason.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
But you talked about, like, going

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
going through the photo album and

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
and I mean, the thing that, like, made my heart

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
like, leap up into my throat

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
or down into my groin or whatever

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
it was that you said

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
the way I remember you saying it is

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
having the visual memory, you're going

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
through a photo scrapbook with your mom

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
and you're, and she's saying

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
this is, this is when we did this

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
and you're, and you're

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
and you're basically having to take her word

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
for it. Like, you know intellectually

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
that she's your mom

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
but you don't actually.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Right, there's no reason.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
The lowest-stakes con game in the world.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
They're not getting away with

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
a lot.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
In their Swiss Bank account.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
But even with your mother, you're seeing her

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
for the first time every time you see her

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
and it's simply memory.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
The visual memories of her.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
It's a lot of that.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
And so as you said, and you said

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
like, your life here in LA has span

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
the last five, six years.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
So I remember them knowledge-wise.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Like, I know that I used to PA out here

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
but I couldn't tell you visually

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
what the person I PAed for looks like

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
but I have the knowledge of it.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
But ironically, this horrible empty desert

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
you know, where we all come

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
to like, put our emotional lives on hold

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
while we try to get ahead in the world

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
of your cradle of memory.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
This is as close as you have to home

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
because this is the place you've been

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
for six years. This is your family.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Yeah, this is where I

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
got back up on my feet.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
You know, I recently, like a year ago

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
got ahead and get my driver's license back.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
So yeah, this is where I

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
rebuilt, you know.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
So, I mean, we have to

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
go to the deepest place of all.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Like, what

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
have they told you in terms of prognosis?

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Have they given you,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
have they told you what to expect

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
in terms of mortality?

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
At first, I didn't want to know

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
so I kept telling them not to tell me.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
And then, it got to a point at Christmas time

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
this past year where

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I think it was the first time

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
because they couldn't figure out what happened

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
like, right after the aneurysm

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
normally you'll go through a state of depression

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
and like, you know, some of the outcomes

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
of it are fatigued, you get tired,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
you know, there's a lot of like things like that.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
And they had it every single day

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
so trying to deal with people

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
and with a smile is like probably

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I think I found a way to do it

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
with ease for once.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
But at first it was really hard

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
and then I think

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I'm sorry, I actually forgot the original question.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Well, I mean, did they tell you?

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Oh yeah, so then I said

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
well, I don't want to know and then in Christmas time

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
they were like, we found three more in your head

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
and to me, I don't know the

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
actual comparison, I just know that it is a comparison.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I was like, well, one of these things

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I'm pretty much killed, almost killed me

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
so this

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
I was like, well, this is like my Vietnam

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
and now I have three of them and I'm like so

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I mean, I'm

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I may have proved that I'm tough

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
on one level but I'm not going to survive

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
three if this happens again

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
and then luckily they've died down

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
we did a couple procedures, you know

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
and I'm back to

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
you know, doing okay.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
So for all anyone knows because

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
you're such a weird mystery

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
to these people. Yeah, I mean, I could still

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
go, I could not wake up tomorrow morning

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
or you could be the

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
four aneurysm guy whose

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
last three they caught because you're such an oddball

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
and like

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
but also it's so mysterious

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
is that you're standing up here and you look like you could be

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
anybody in the room, it's not like you're

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
you look debilitated and you say

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
inwardly you're in pain and stuff like that

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
but yeah, sometimes you'll notice

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I hunch, it's hard sometimes

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
to make eye contact because

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
someone tried to explain to me like a low level

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
of autism because sometimes they

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
have that but I feel when I'm comfortable

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
around people it's not a big deal

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
but crowds, I can kind of just feel

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
all the attention. You're

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
at Zerd Melt, there's no eye contact going on

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
here at all. You found

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
the right place. If you

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
want to be looked at, dress like shoelaces.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
If you want to be looked at, dress like shoelaces.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Is there, I mean

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
I want to ask you

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
like I hope you're not offended by my characterization

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
of you as somebody who is

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
like tethered to us

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
but somewhere else

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
like somewhere beyond

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
like the place that we have the luxury

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
of just not thinking about and lying at the bank

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
like I was like oh shit I had a bad day today

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
you know I don't

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
should I propose to my girlfriend

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I don't know maybe I will

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
maybe I won't

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
oh my car's out of gas

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
there's always

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
this like

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
independence day flying saucer

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
hovering in the sky

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
that is

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
blacking out the sun

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
but completely ignorable

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
day to day for all of us

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
which is that we

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
live minute to minute second to second

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
by the grace of some

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
completely unforgiving

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
absolutely inhuman thing

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
and I just like

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
we just don't

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
like it's uncomfortable to ask people

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
who are further

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
in the clutches of this thing

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
further at its mercy in a demonstrable way

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
but seems important to ask

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
like what

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
what do we do

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
how do we feel

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
how do you feel

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
what message can you give to us

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
that in any way

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
lets us stop fucking around

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
I don't know

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I don't know

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
oh by the way a soul star

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
has his powers on page one

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
none of that page

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
so get your powers

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
before page 20

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
speed it up hollywood

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I don't know

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
that

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
that I think resonates

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
so I tell people all the time

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
it's just give more to the world

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
than what you take

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
there's no right answer

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
there's no wrong answer

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
just do what you love

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
and don't hurt anyone it sounds generic

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
but it's like

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I'm not afraid of

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
if I don't wake up tomorrow

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
I still try to do

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
everything I want to do in a day

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
and I just hope it's enough

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
and I think that's all

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
any of us can do

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
there's no

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
there's no cosmic

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
right answer here

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I think that was it

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
I think that does it

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
give more than you take

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
that absolutely has to be the answer

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I know it's under all our noses

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
but we don't believe it

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
when our mom says it

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
because she's in the kitchen making cookies

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
we need heroes

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
to take the

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
trek and call back over their shoulder

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
this is the truth

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
it was interesting

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
when you told me that last week

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
because I've heard people try to describe me

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
and normally I don't like it

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
well you look like you and McGregor

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
just so you know

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I would love to see some of your art

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
is there a way that we can commission some

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
for us

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
can you see something you draw

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
can we see like

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I want to see the blue test lines

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
that are inked in later on

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
that sounds fascinating

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
my dad's a really good artist

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I'd watch him draw

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
and he would draw a million lines really light

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
and then he would hone in

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
and draw a line

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
so it was covered in lines

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
and then he would find it

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
that's kind of in a way

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
mentally how I approach a lot of things

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
visually that art approach

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
it's just trial by error

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
the way I look at it is if I have to physically see something

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
to draw it

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
then I'll just keep drawing it until it makes sense

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
I tried looking at things

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
and there seems to be a slight translation

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
disconnect

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
but I'm getting better at it

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
if someone sat in front of me and I could draw their face

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
it would take a while

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
because I'm actually trying to use a part of the brain

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
that isn't there anymore for me

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
so you can feel it

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
big time

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I feel like the strain

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
that it's taking

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
to transfer this to this

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
with nothing up here

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
so if you wanted to draw something from memory

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
say you wanted to draw

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
a car or draw a banana

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
or anything

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
there's nothing you're conjuring up in your head

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
you're waiting until you see it

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
and that reminds you of

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I cheated

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
recently I have an art show downtown

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
and

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
someone was standing near me

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
and there was a draw

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
go over and draw on the wall

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
and I was looking at him and drawing

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
and I just made him a zombie

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
as I'm doing the circles

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
a hole was in his cheek

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
so I drew a couple teeth there

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
but I'm looking at him and doing it

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
and someone was like oh my god you did it from memory

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
I don't know

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I felt so nice to hear that

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I kind of lied

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
and then I could just

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
feel like my old self again

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
but now what you're drawing is

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
you have to be

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
you're forced to be totally in the moment

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
you're drawing something for the first time

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
every time so that's amazing

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
something that can be really valuable

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
and visceral

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
to look at

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
yeah so what are you complaining about

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
you've been giving this gift

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
I know

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
wait people with any years of problems

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
I do I mean I've met people

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
who

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
have it much much worse

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
who didn't get out of that world

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
is there a community out there?

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
oh yeah there's a great group at UCLA that meets

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
twice a month

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
and then there's a group on Facebook that I'm part of

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
that we share our stories on there

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
and I go to

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
ICUs and I meet people who have this

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
however going through it

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
I took some of their stories

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
and I put it in Soul Star

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
it's a little bit more special

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
and then obviously I give all the proceeds

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
to the aneurysm foundation

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
because that's another way I just want to give back

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
and

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
again just me trying to give more

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I think

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
before I had my aneurysm

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
I was probably the kind of guy that took enough

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
and so I kind of

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
look at this as a second chance

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
and people can google

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
the aneurysm foundation if they wanted

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
to be inspired

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
by this podcast to put something into it

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
ok well thank you so much Seek for coming up

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
we'll have you back

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I'm not a hugger

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I don't hug people

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
enough we've hugged a couple times

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
if anybody should be hugged they should hug Seek

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
I didn't

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
alright

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I want to hug

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
everybody in this room

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
alright well we're not going to

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
you see why I flipped those segments

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I didn't follow that with the complaining about the

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
valet dollar

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
our next segment is called

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
my favorite serials

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I think Lucky Charms

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
is underrated

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
I don't know

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
what am I going to patent our podcast

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
on the back

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
I feel the fidgeting

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
it's fucking hard to

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
I don't know

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I watched

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
you while you were talking

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
to Seek and also when you talk

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
to anybody about any kind of ailments

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
you get really

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
physically like you start pulling

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
your hair out on top of your head

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
and you get a huge erection

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
it's not

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
it's not appropriate

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
huge is not the word I would have used

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
you're certainly around

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
it's intense

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
my penis becomes

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
flushed

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
what if you only got an actually huge erection

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
when somebody else is in pain

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
I think those people exist

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
there's books about them

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
I was saying like

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
what we were talking earlier about

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
the superpower of being deaf or blind

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
we were talking about deafness and you were talking about

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
like

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
what would it be like for you to be deaf

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I had this weird empathetic

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I'm not sure what the word is

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I think when someone says they have a knee injury

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
my knee hurts and if someone says they have a toe

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
I'll wince

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I'll actually feel it in my toes

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
not to undercut your

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
I think

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
that's a natural sympathy

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
it's an invitation to us

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
and yet it can be

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
repellent

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I've talked to people

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
who are wheelchair bound for whatever reason

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
at WGA

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
the panels

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
and stuff like that

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
someone came up to me once and was like

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
hey where's the physically

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I don't even know the politically correct phrases anymore

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
can I please just communicate

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
where's the physically disabled person in community

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
and I was like you're right Jesus Christ

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
like it's so hard

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
to do comedy about this stuff though

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
but therefore it's so relieving

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
when you do do it and I started

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
talking a little bit

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
people come into

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
the room in a wheelchair

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
and you're the flood

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
of

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
don't want that to be happening to you

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
that you feel when you see

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
someone

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
in any kind of condition

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
can shut off

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
like a

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
surge of electricity

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
it just can throw all these circuits

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
and result in people treating you like a living ghost

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
and Seek is saying

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
I have friends

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
that have migraines but you're talking about

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
your inability to even make eye contact

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
when it's happening it's like

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I start wincing now we're both wincing

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
now it looks like I don't care

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
but the thing is

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
it's like

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
I think we all have our own

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
incredibly intense physical

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
or emotional response to that stuff

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
yeah well it's sympathy

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
it's weird

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
because

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
you can go on the internet

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
you can look at little animated gifts of babies

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
getting run over by minivans in China

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
and you

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
you can

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
and we look at gore videos

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
we see

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
skateboarders crack up

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
and you go

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
you experience what they're experiencing

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
but we have this

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
potential with our forebrain

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
to turn that into

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
toxic apathy

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
like well

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
that I'm going to be punk rock

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
this is nothing new at all

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
people

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
ever since we became sentient apes

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
we have been afraid

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
of the thing we realized was going to happen to us

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
which is that we were going to die

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
and the first thing we immediately started doing

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
is we started worshiping death

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
you worship things that you fear

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
like

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
the tribal mentality is to

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
take like a big scary monster

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
put it on your head

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
and dance around the campfire and go

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
this guy is not going to fuck with me

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
or I'm harnessing its power

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
because I'm wearing it

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
and it's the thing that ate the universe

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
and is going to eat it again

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
you try as hard as you can

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
to atone with these things

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
that scare you the most

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
but you also in so doing

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
you can like

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
that jaded gothy

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
fucking like

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
pierce my face

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
and put a finger on my forehead and like

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I don't fucking care about life

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
I'm gonna fucking die

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
it's not

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
it's sort of like you're

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
are you really handling it

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
like jadedness is also not

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
it's not dealing with death

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
it's not dealing with pain

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
like feeling it is

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
we have tear ducts in our eyes

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
they squirt water

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
when we get upset

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
you're not really a crier or a hugger

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
you're not an emotional guy

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
no I'm a huge crier I cried at the end of Doc Hollywood

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
I just

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I'll cry on any I'll cry at the top of a hat

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
if I let myself feel stuff

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I'll cry all the time

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
why aren't you a hugger

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
because I know that

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
because I'll start crying I'll fucking hug me

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
and I'll start crying

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
what are you retarded

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
sorry

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
learn nothing

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
alright let's

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
is that why you do all this stuff Dan

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
to keep everything at arm's length

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
that you won't just be a big

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
weeping mess in the corner

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
well I mean

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
let's play judges and drag

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
no we gotta talk about it

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
that's why we all do everything

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
we all love each other

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
we all feel connected to each other

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
and it hurts all the time

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
we all feel that fear

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
that if we let ourselves feel it for a second

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
we would die

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
yeah that's my thing

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
people say

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I'm either really close to you or I'm really aloof

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I'm really like I keep

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
I'm the Heisman trophy

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
at arm's length and I hold a couple of things

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
close

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
and I am very aloof

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
because if I let people in

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
then I just will cry all the time

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
I'm a huge intent for people's pain

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
and if there's anything hurt in the room

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
it's like

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
I have to like push everything away

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
and the suit is armor

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
and

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
my voice and my gestures

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
everything is a way to deflect and keep everything

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
at some sort of distance

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
because if they get close it's close

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
and it's incredibly painful

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
well it gets messy

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I mean like Sikh said

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
he's experiencing symptoms of autism

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
because of his aneurysm

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
and one of those symptoms is that when he feels

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
he's standing in a room full of people

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
it's a common misconception

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
that autistic

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
people

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
in the spectrum like they don't have empathy

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
they don't have feelings

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
like a lot of them will complain

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
that when they walk into a party

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
they are flooded

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
with bullshit

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
like just feedback it's like holding a microphone up to a speaker

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
and that is what results

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
in the appearance

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
of lack of empathy because

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
you have to put a brick wall

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
to keep it out

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
and I can't even look out

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
because my vantage point for the podcast listeners

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
is I'm kind of facing the stage

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
I'm kind of facing the audience

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
and peripherally on both sides

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
I just see people having bodily reactions throughout the entire thing

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
I can't even look

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
I see people like there's certain physical reactions

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
people have and it's like it's so

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
and also like

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
there's no need to make any jokes out of this

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
I think it's

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
as interesting as anything else

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I think one

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
and it's going to be amazing

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
is it going to be racist?

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
a pollock and a jew

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
I knew it

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
have an aneurysm together

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
and the pollock's like whoa that's great

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
because he's an idiot

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
he loves aneurysms

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
and the jew's like whoa it was you

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
we're off the rack

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
rebate discount

59:16.000 --> 59:22.000
alright let's bring Spencer up

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
for those of you in the Hollywood Reporter

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
reading the transcript of my

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
hey guys

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
what happened?

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
it is a gauntlet

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
that is not up to fire code

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
how's it going living with your roommate?

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
it's

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
it's kind of like autism

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
don't play that card

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
how's it going at your new job?

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
it's so easy

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
but my boss is a dick

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
for those of you who don't know

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Spencer is newly employed under Dan Harmon's

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Tiddlish

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
he's Dan's assistant

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
he's doing great

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
it's really easy

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
what does your dick consist of

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
throughout your work day

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
what goes on?

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I roll in around 9.3945

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
if I'm extremely early

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
sometimes I'll grab some breakfast

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
in the commissary

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
there's a commissary

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
but I know I get to the office

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
is it an old time me like Hollywood Commissary

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
where there's a guy dressed up like a centurion

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
and there's a guy

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
there's an elephant

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I'm always constantly two guys

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
with a giant sheet of plate glass

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
back and forth

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
back and forth

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
it's exactly like that

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
it's weird

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I don't know what those are like

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
actually I put that on the list

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
of things I'm not allowed to complain about

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Paramount's commissary

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
which is called the dining room

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
closes at 3pm

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
call it the lunching room

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
closes at 3pm

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
you can't get a drink there

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
when you really need it

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
yeah

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
is there booze there too?

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
there is, there's a little bar

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
it's not what I would call

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
it's not like the bar in the love boat

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
it's not like a cool place to retire

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
it's funny because

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I have a bottle of kettle in my office

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
and a guy who's paid to pour it for you

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
that's most of my job

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
you guys

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
so speaking of love

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
speaking of love

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
are you dressed in a white tux like Isaac

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
he does it in the back

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
are you joking? I'm dressed like this

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
day tux

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
get this guy a tux for fuck's sake

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I could dress him however I wanted I guess

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
right?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
that would be funny

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
didn't Sikhs message you

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
give more to the world than what you take

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
land at all to you?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
put him in a tuxedo

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
well that's why I want to create a situation

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
somehow where I want to get Spencer

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
on camera in community

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I want him to be in the show

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
to keep pushing this

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I want to see

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
because Spencer so far has proven unflappable

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
he's grunting an agony

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I'm flapping

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I want to give you

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I want to find your flapping point

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I'm not an actor dude

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
you're not a podcast

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
celebrity

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
you had that documentary

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
you didn't blanch from cameras any more than you do

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
from a live audience here

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
that was part of it

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
you kind of knew going into it

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
that would be an aspect of it

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
what if you make it through

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
let's say you do a guest star thing

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
on community

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
like a little walk on

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
oh and here's my dungeon master

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
and he'll be like hey how's it going

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and then you're off

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
and we'll see how it goes

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
we'll see if you go home that night and cut yourself

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
what if that's the point where he starts getting

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
fake tan that goes to the gym a lot

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
and he comes out and his chief changes his name to

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
well then I'll hand him off as a mentee

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
to Joel McHale

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
like Joel

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Joel will take you from there

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and welcome you into the world of being an Adonis

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
he'll show you crunches

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
and do the

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
one almond for breakfast diet

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
oh man

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
what if you're only like eight months away

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
from dating Mila Kunis or something like that

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
that's weird

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
that's everything's weird

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I'm just going to be passed around

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
by famous people

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
yes

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
just hauled up to this Mayan pyramid

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
where eventually you'll get your head cut off

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
right

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
because the moon and the sun are

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
you'll find out the joke is running you the whole time

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
it's just simply an elaborate suicide murder thing

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
so

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
speaking of weird things

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Aaron can't be here tonight

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
she's at a show

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Kumail is

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
well to quote his wife Emily

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Hot Tub Time Machine 2 isn't going to shoot itself

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
he's on set

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
he's at work

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Hot Tub Time Machine 2

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
that's going to answer so many questions from that person

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
that was ironic when they came up with it

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
but then they made a sequel and now it's like

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
okay it doesn't get to be ironic now you're actually making

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Hot Tub Time Machine 2

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
by the way this is the end is awesome

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
can't wait till it comes out in a video

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
cool

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
never been so excited about a movie

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
this is the end I can't stop blowing that movie

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
anyways

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
that was a good movie

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
it was so funny

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
but what I decided is

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
we're going back to the basics

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I hope you can manage it narratively

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
it's just me and Jeff this time

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
the other characters

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
can either be

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
come in tow as NPCs

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
or they wink out of existence

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
but I just want to get back to the roots

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
man

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
it's time we did

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
what do you think about that Spencer?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I think that's a great plan

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
when he goes into that voice ladies and gentlemen

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
it could only be one thing

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
oh can it

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
it means

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
we're starting

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
unseasonably early in the show

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
can I even carry it on this long?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
who knows

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
how much dungeon did you create for this?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
let's find out

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I charge north as fast as I can

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
we found out

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
we play a private session

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
a dance place

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
you call it a private session

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
it's just a regular game

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
all D&D games

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
are just these public affairs

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
city pauses

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
the only time I've ever played one

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
was when it's publicly

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
consumable via live audience

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
or broadcast

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
it's a private affair

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
meaning no black people

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
no Asian people

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
it's a private affair

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
we found out last time

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Dan got reprimanded

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
for metagaming

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
can we talk about that?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
sure

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
since it makes you uncharacteristically excited

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
yeah

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
yeah talk about how what a fuck up I am

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
no that's the whole

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
that's what I want to talk about

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I got yelled at for metagaming

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I didn't yell and let him talk about it

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Dan the whole thing is

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I want to talk about this defense mechanism

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
you're throwing up

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
no okay

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Spencer Hollywood has changed you Ben

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
oh I know

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
after this I got no words on my commissary

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
like

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
cafeteria is another word

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
for it but that doesn't sound cool

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I didn't even finish explaining the job

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I don't care I get him drinks

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
what else do you do you get me drinks

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
you sit in the writers room

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
the writers love you sometimes Spencer will call out

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
a word very discreetly

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
like he'll be like

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
giraffe

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
you know like when we're stuck

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
you know and then like we'll use it

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
yeah I thought I would get in trouble

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
now you have to join the guild

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
yeah

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
oh I was thinking of

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
the guild of calamitous intent

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
yeah

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
see you could take the Hollywood

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
oh no you can take the Spencer

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
what do you think about my story breaking

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
okay so oh yeah

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
that's awesome I mean

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
you were kind of blown away weren't you

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
blown away by how

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
organic it was

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
it's just very natural

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
it's kind of how I come up with ideas

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
but I don't have a room of people I just have

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
you know all the voices in my head

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
it's pretty impressive me

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
yeah

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
you're a good person

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Dan's a good person

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I'm talented

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I would say extremely talented

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
thank you I mean

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I don't know where it's coming from

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
thank you

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
anyway what is your story breaking method

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
is that

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
you know what Simon and Schuster I'll tell you

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
in the spring of February 2017

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
when I'll charge you $20

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
a copy

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I'm not kidding I don't know

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
we can't go into that now it's $9.19

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
$9.19 is it

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
let's just say it's very organic and very

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
primal

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
tell us what happened last week at art

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
does everyone know what metagaming

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
is? not everyone knows

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
that's a terrible question

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
does anybody by applause know what

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
metagaming is?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Jesus Christ

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
okay for everybody else in Dungeons and Dragons

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
sometimes the characters don't know stuff

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
that the person who plays the character

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
does for instance if a character

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
came up with what you in the real world

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
know as a camera your character wouldn't

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
know what a camera is because he's never seen one before

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
even though it's pretty regular technology right

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
so it would not make sense to be like

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
oh that's a camera so that's metagaming

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
essentially there's different ways it comes out

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
anyway they were fighting a monster

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
it was a bed it was a sticky bed

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
um

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
it was a bed

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
which everyone has knowledge of

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
but it jumped around

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
it started sticking to people it was tackling folks

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
um

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
and I let slip to Rob Schrobb

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
who had his first edition

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
monster manual that it was a monster in there

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
and I pointed it to him because I wanted some

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
nerd cred you know but that was

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
my mistake and I caught

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I caught you know I admit

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
fully to that that was terrible on my part

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
but he showed you and then

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
you tried to play it off like you were

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
uh like an old hand

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
who's just like oh yeah a mimic

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
that's what that is you know mimics

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I didn't know this I wasn't trying to play anything

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
off I apologize that was the air I got

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
from you I really I thought that was

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
really awesome I swear to god I wasn't

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
trying to like deceive or anything

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
yeah no it's he didn't know anything

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I thought what happened was granted

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I'm very drunk during all of these

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
things call call days

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
days

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
oh boy okay

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
when you were describing the monster Rob at the monster

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
manual I thought that I knew

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
what it was I thought it was like like a

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
trapper or something like that yeah something

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
like like where it's like a carpet or

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
uh and I was like oh I think I think I know

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
what this is and I looked it up in the thing and

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I noticed that hit the page that had the

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
succubus illustration was torn out of his

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
monster manual

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
for those of you

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
who know what that means

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
um but I was like oh shit

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I don't think this is it

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
then I diverted my attention

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
was taken by booze and

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
and you know cake and whatever

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
then at a certain point Rob

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
like elbowed me and was pointing

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
at the mimic

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I thought that

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I didn't know that you had pointed at that

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
yeah no I know that definitely okay

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I thought that Rob had found it

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
so that we I thought we were collectively

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
like like oh if we

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
and in my day it was called table talk

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
and kind of game knowledge or whatever

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
boring conversation

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
yeah well in dance time it was the DM

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
versus the player so the DM would try to

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
fuck you up and then you'd have to look

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
at the monster manual to stand a chance

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
so it's kind of it makes sense

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
but anyway the end result

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
was he was like oh mimics are weak against

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
food if you give him food he'll stop

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
fighting and um that's

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
that like is kind of flagrant

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
over the line of metagaming so I was like

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
okay I gotta explain this concept

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
and I explained it very poorly

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
and um and then I think that

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
you and Dan just thought I was trying to like

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
punish you but I was just trying to explain it

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Dan doesn't like being told like what to do

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
or that he did something wrong and he looked

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
at you the rest of the game we're just like

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
like he wanted to stab your face

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
you know come on

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
and uh and

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
but his his hatred

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
of being told that he did something wrong

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
met with his clear uh

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
respect for what you do and who you are

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
and he just sat there looking like a little poopy bridges

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
but there was

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
no way of knowing I wasn't doing it

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
to be punitive just to explain a concept

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
that would have otherwise been hard to illustrate

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
well easy real first of all

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
no one should be reading the monster manual during the game

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
that's fine that's an easy real to understand

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
then we get into this metagaming thing

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
and it's like the difference between metagaming

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
and what we used to call table talk

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
which is if I walk into a room

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
if you and I walk into a room and we see a troll

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
that's holding a staff with a red ruby on the top of it

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
if I in all of my 20 years

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
of playing Dungeons & Dragons go

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
oh that might be a fireball wand

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
like maybe which I

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
like is that metagaming

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
if I'm just talking to another player

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I'm not saying to the other character

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
blah blah blah

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
so what I decided is

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I'm just going to be immersed in my character

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
all the time that way I'll never

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
be at risk of metagaming

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
but that scenario you explained wasn't

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
metagaming like table talk can still happen

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
it just can't like

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
inexplicably cross the bound then your character

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
would have to be like oh

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
a wand of thing like I saw

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
that dude shooting fireballs out of earlier

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
then it would make sense that your character would know

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
but if you're like oh that's a wand of fireball

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
because my player who plays me knows

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I still don't get it though

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
you just confused me again because if I say to another player

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
if I haven't done anything

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I say to another player oh that might be a

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
wand of fireballs if we don't

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
outside of your character

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
that's metagaming you shouldn't do

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
no that's not metagaming that's just talking

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
wait no I'm confused

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
okay metagaming only pertains to your

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
character actions

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
so anything you Jeff does is fine

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
oh but we can do sidebars with each other

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
and say I think it sounds like a thing

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
yeah but then your character would have to

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
come up with an in-character reason to be taking

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
that course of action well I think you'll find

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
if you look back

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
that I have never metagamed

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
and but I

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
will be in character if I agree

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
otherwise you're fired

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
you know when I was agreeing with you

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
in the writers room I actually did agree

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I wasn't just trying to grease things along

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
you were right in that instance

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
sorry I want this is exciting

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
I want your relationship business-wise

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
and friendship-wise to go so far

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
that one day he just supplants you

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
where he'd be too

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
that's called an apprenticeship

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
but you have to be allowed to let that happen

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
and I know you you're gonna fight

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
like a dragon you're gonna you're gonna

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
that makes me a worthy mentor

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
you're gonna try to force work

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I think Obi-Wan would have been good at his job

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
if Luke came into his cave it was just like

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
oh thanks for this lightsaber

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
yeah but Obi-Wan

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
let himself be cut in half

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
so that Luke could get me hurt

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
by a dude that's like super evil and powerful

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
right but I'm saying you're gonna

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
you're not gonna go down that easy

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
you go down easy

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
you are gonna go down easy

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
well it cost $20

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
same as in town

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
can we please get to the matter at hand

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
alright let's do this

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Spencer ready?

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
yeah

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
last met the gang was in the midst

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
of yellow camp

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
which was under demonic occupation

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
after rushing into the camp

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
our heroes encountered in dispatch

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
to bearded devil

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
before entangling a group of slimy

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
lemurs

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
the heroes freed a couple of the barbarians

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
and met with slab squat thrust

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
the half orc cleric

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
the team

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
reacquainted themselves with slab

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
and they formed packs with each other

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
and stuff

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
before catching the attention of a second bearded

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
devil

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Sharpie said no

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
the devil heeded not their threats

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
the gang tried

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
synchronized in performance art

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
with the attempt of ending the devil's

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
threat

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
the devil heeded not the art

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Moran and Quark attempted to gift the devil

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
with a potentially lethal necklace

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
the devil heeded not the gift

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
the gang resorted to

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
the violence

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
violence worked

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
but during the

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
combat Moran turned

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
and stabbed slab squat squat thrust

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
in the face

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
the demon was slain

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
but afterwards at the end of the combat

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
the group turned to survey their ranks

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
and saw Moran holding

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
a bloody dagger next to a bleeding

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
dying slab squat thrust

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
what would they do

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
with the friendly fire in their ranks

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
we'll find out

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
next

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
next

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
chicken out

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Friday

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
so slab squat thrust got killed

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
oh he's dying

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
well

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Moran why'd you do that

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I don't like him

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
fair enough

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
he was a stranger

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
she did it because

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
he

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I don't know he joined in a pact with me

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I was never quite clear on it he was on our side

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
he was pact blocking

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
he was a dirty

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
pact blocker

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
are we looking at other foes right now

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
not right now

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
we gotta go find your father we gotta find

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
my dad we gotta go find lord butz a lot

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
that's true

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
is there any intelligence we can gain from

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
these people

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
are there barbarians around us there are barbarians

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
you freed a couple and they were freeing

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
more barbarians while you were

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
fighting demons are they butz a lot

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
they are butz a lot but there's some of the gnolls

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
alright butz a lot

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
gnolls where is my father

I am sharpy butz a lot

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
they all

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
kinda talk to each other

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
and they're like thanks for saving us

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I don't know though

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I don't know though

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
one of the gnolls

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
kinda breaks rank

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
and kinda walks up to you

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
and you recognize him as

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
a gnoll that you've met before his yellow defer

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
is smelly and filthy

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
and

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
you recognize him as yurch he was a guy who

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I think he showed you to your dad

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
I don't know it happened stuff happened

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
you remember him from the past yurch

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
yurch the peace out

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
how's it going

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
where is my father

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
where is my father

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I think he's in that pit over there

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
he's in a pit

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I think

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I look to where he's pointing

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
he's pointing at a pit

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
but between the pit and you

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
are the lemurs that you had entangled

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
by vines they're kinda still entangled

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
they haven't made

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
much progress against these vines

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
so they're alive

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
they're alive but they're like

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
as if they're in a net how many are there

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
there's seven

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
what is cleave I have a new power called cleave

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
that'll help you hit two people at once

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
okay

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
is it worthwhile

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
yeah let's just wipe them out

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
okay I charge towards the entangled

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
oh wait well if you're gonna be up close

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
look I'm gonna do a fireball first

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
okay okay they're immune to fire remember

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
no Adam Goldberg called out

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
they're immune to fire

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
are these these these these

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Leo Mars what do they call

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
lemurs

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I charge in

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
with my sword

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
cleave

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
alright

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
alright

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
alright it's like Barry White

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
is a dungeon master

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
stuff's happening

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
yeah girl

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
cleave those lemurs

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
you take out

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
two lemurs in a single

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
stroke

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
it sounds kind of like that

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
the rest of them kind of shiver

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
and anguish and kind of shrink down

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
fear

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
fuck it

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
they're still tied up

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
alright well

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I think we've dealt with them

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
well no my dad's on a pit on the other side of them

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
alright I just I mean I

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
I mean I don't want

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
to waste shocking grasp on these little slugs

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
you can pass to me I still got a taste for blood

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
I can go back in there with my sword

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
and start chopping alright go for it

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I'll cast Melph's Acid Arrow on

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Melph's Acid Arrow

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
a milf

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
no not a milf

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
yes it finds the nearest

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Melph's Acid Arrow

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
2d4 damage for

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
yeah

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
yeah that happens

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
shoot it at one that he's not gonna

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Melph is a mom else like to fuck

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
it takes

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
12 no not 12 9 damage

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I can't math today

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
this is the worst

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I'm loving this

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I'm bipolar

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
okay

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I don't know

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
how to make up these things

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
like we don't want to deal with them anymore

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
they're they're dead

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
am I metagaming

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
that's another thing entirely

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
okay well you killed two

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I'll just say they're all dead

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
they're in the net

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
that's metagaming

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
or just laziness

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
it's just laziness yeah

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
you can't just call anything buzzwords

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
they're related

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
humble brag

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
alright all the demons

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
are slain

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
alright I look into the pit

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
after making a big show

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
of the thorns receding

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
my amulet of spring

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
thorns replace yourselves

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
upon my amulet

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
amulet

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
that happens

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
and it's cinematic

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
and visually stunning

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
alright

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
so you edge your way over to the pit

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
and peering inside it goes down

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
about 20 feet and in the very middle

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
you see

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
your father's head

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
dad

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
is that just your head or are you buried

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I'm buried like in a

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I cast feather fall and drop down to him

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
alright you drop down to him

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
without taking any harm

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
but I make a big show also

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I raise my arms out like I'm sting

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
in a music video

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
dropping down like

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I just want him to understand that magic's important

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
gracefully drifting like sting

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
down the pit

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
your father is thoroughly impressed

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
and also buried up to his neck

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
dad what are you doing

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I've been buried down here

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
by demons

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
alright let me look up for traps down there

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Charpie

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
whatever

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
go get a shovel

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
he does

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
and merch

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
like a bottle of water

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
say merch

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
yurch

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
that was the guy that handled t-shirts

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
that's me

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I go out and look for shovels with yurch

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
okay you guys find

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
like the motherlode of shovels

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I come back with like

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
too many shovels

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
dad

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
can you go into some detail

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
about what happened

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
oh can I

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
when you left

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
if you recall

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
you threw quark onto a robot

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
and you ended up needed to rescue him

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
from an airship

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
after that happened

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
those airships they went north

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
but then a day later the dark armada

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
returned in full force

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
carrying waste to our countryside

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
they deployed multiple cantroids

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
as well as sending down demons

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
lemurs and devils

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
and they ravaged towns and villages

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
murdering and enslaving anyone

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
they set siege to the western dwarves

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
ripping apart the very mountains

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
to retrieve the three shards of power

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
the dwarves had been stockpiling

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
they've been enslaving the strongest of us

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
forcing us to work on their horror engines

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
which have been serving some nefarious evil

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
for weeks

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
coming up in the sky

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
allowing the free travel of dark stars

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
black airships and airborne demons and devils alike

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
you must stop Admiral Darkstar

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
son

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
for all of our sakes

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
it must have been hard for you to say that

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
also get me out of that

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I'm buried

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
we're going to take care of that

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I see six or seven shovels

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I take two of the shovels

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
and either handedly

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
like a weird barbarian spider

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
you can find that extremely

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
ineffective way to burrow

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
but at the same time

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
you do end up freeing him

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
he kind of stretches his limbs

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
he's like yeah I guess they found me too tough

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
to imprison

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
so they just buried me

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
don't we have some of the shards they're looking for

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
you guys have

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
three shards and I believe

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Mango had ingested

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
one of them

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
have you pooped yet dad?

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
did it hurt?

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I mean

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
let's be honest

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
no more than usual

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
did it seem

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
extra magical?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I detect magic on his poop

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
there's no ready supply of poop at the moment

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
where did you poop dad?

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
well I mean

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
to be honest just there

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
like in the pit

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
in my pants

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
okay look at the poops

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
it's all around the sun

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
I look around for a shard in the poop

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
he just rolled dice

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
it's so dry

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
you don't find anything

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
he kind of watches you looking around

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
and he's like yeah yeah

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
no I definitely passed it

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
but I mean I gave it to my people

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
for safekeeping

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
is there a sink around I can go wash up?

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
this is more of a barbarian

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
camp?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
who's the guy you gave it to?

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
oh Johnson

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Johnson get over here

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Johnson?

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
a barbarian lopes up and clutches a pouch

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
of fine leather

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
he relinquishes the pouch to Mango

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
before taking his exit

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Johnson is that the shard

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
that my dad sharded?

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
yeah

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
what about the dwarven shards

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
have they been recovered by Admiral Darkstar?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
we presume Darkstar

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
has them to be honest

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
we're not on good terms with these dwarves

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
so we don't know

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
yeah well about that dad

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
don't you think it's possible that we got bigger fish to fry

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
than our petty local

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
conflicts?

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
it's a pretty good point

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
a drunk dad

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I've been buried

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I go into a mild barbarian rage

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
and insist that they hug

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I use diplomacy

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
which both of those things

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
they're mutually exclusive

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
okay I use intimidate

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I intimidate them into hugging each other

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
I have

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
a 10 bonus skill modifier

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
intimidation

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
well yeah

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
so

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
phrase your intimidation for me

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I want you two assholes to hug

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
so we can get back to business

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
calm down guy

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
we're hugging

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
he hugs Sharpie

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I cry while hugging

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
not because the hug is emotional

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
because I'm being forced to hug

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I'm hugging

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
it's like a scene in Munich

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
it doesn't feel right

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
that happens

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
okay well

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
jeez dad

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
where do you think Admiral Darkstar went?

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
holy cow dad

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I'm Michael J. Fox now

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
who is that you speak of?

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
holy cow dad

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
where do you think they went?

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
yeah

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
that's metagame

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
because he wouldn't know

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
you get it? he wouldn't know who that is

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
yeah well

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
there's no problem I'm just pointing it out

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
yeah but I'm not doing something

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I didn't get a hoverboard

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I said

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
what is a hoverboard?

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
let's find one and go to Admiral Darkstar

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
no

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
to be clear I want metagaming to happen

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
what is a stage?

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
what is a stage?

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
yeah what are you talking about?

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I get a spurious point for not knowing Michael J. Fox's

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
right?

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
sure

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
alright perfect

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
yeah okay so where do we go?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
when you phrased it at one point

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
you use the example of if you go up to a bridge

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
and I say oh there's a bridge

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
across the river and if one of you says

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
oh if you walk to the middle of it it might

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
be a trap that's metagaming

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I mean come on

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
that was in the terrible explanation portion of that

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
I take

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
the six shovels and kind of put them together

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
to form like a crude ladder so we can all

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
climb out and I climb up to the top of the

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
pit and I go let's stop fucking about

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
and get on with this

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
alright I got some Darkstar

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
you can't turn the shovels into ladders dude

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
well you can kind of stack them up and kind of like angle them

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
together

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
like he pushes them into

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
the side of the pit

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
like temper sports

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
and that exists because

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
this is oldest timber

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
yeah yeah okay so you

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
jam the shovels in the wall and climb up

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
out of there that's cool

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
that tracks

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
alright

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
mango

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
point is in the right direction

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
do we need an army what do we do

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
do we just run off and go in search

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
of Admiral Darkstar

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
well yeah you might need an army

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
but

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
around here we kind of got a mop up the demons

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
so I'm afraid I can't really spare too many

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
barbarians

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
you can take your

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
you're just pretty good about finding shovels

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I hope he's not

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
demoralized by my dad's

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
clearly dubious endorsement

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
it was Yerch with an earshot when my dad

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
did that weird like sideways

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
glance as he offered up Yerch

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
nah

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
you can have my corkscrew

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
okay we'll take Yerch

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
but dad would it offend you

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
if I took some dwarves

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I mean

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
yes it would but

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
this is the fate of the universe we're talking about

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
yeah dad

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
wait no just the material plane probably

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
but still

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
a total metaphor for your

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
racism

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
yeah

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
at all racism not a metaphor for your

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
racism

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
far be it from me

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
to tell you how to save the planet

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
but uh

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I should at least tell you you know that

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
save the planet dad

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
races working together

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
booyah

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
your words have touched him

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
he feels touched

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I cast

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Einberg's

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
lengthening arm and pat myself on the back

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
okay that happens sure

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
but yeah he's like that cloak you've been wearing

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I gave you that cloak to help you

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
save your friend yeah it kind of ran out of

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
charge like immediately

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
yeah it works once per day

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
but you know

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
every time a new day happens

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
you can actually use it

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
well I also have a falcon

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
that I never use yeah I'm just you know

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I mean that falcon he can fly

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
and you know I'm told he shares spells

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
with his caster

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I'm just reading the rules right now

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
what do you mean he shares spells

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
he can cast your spells for you

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
what really I can send him up in the air

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
and have him cast fireball down on people

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
not quite yet

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
but when you get strong enough he can channel

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
certain spells

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
dad why are you such a magic expert all of a sudden

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I just you know I just thought it'd be a good

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
appropriate time to you know fill you guys

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
with some important knowledge some meta knowledge

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
yeah

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
can you explain to me what my talking dagger is good for

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
if I'm not mistaken

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
that talking dagger shattered and turned

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
into like a force of nature

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
yeah but I've been

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
buried lately so

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
you can tell

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
pretty good for a buried guy

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
yeah yeah yeah alright

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
my enslaved barbarians

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
they have their ears to the ground

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
father

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
I shall defeat Admiral Darkstar

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
but I shall do it under the banner of all

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
races and all beings

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
of the material plane for

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Admiral Darkstar represents not just

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
an external threat to those

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
beings but the internal threat

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
that is

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
all the people not

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
knowing that they should hang out

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
together I was

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
really convinced up till the end

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
there but I'm still with you

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I'm just saying

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
I'm your son and I want to make you proud of me

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
and I'm going to do it

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
by

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
being like kind of a Martin Luther King

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
junior of medieval

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
fantasy who is this Martin Luther King

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Junior

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
is he a fool

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
with this Michael Fox you talked to him

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
hoverboards

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Michael Luther King Junior was the Michael

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
J. Fox of civil rights

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I don't know how else to explain it

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
while they're talking I go into

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
an office nearby and patent my new

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
shovel ladder technology

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
I do some diagrams just

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
make sure that it seems like a pretty good invention

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
you just sell a bag of

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
six ladders as

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Quirk's

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Portable Magic Ladder

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Yeah, yeah, Quirk's shovel steps

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
but Dad I got to know

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
where you think Admiral Darkstar went

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Admiral Darkstar lurks

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
in his black keep far to the north

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
the north

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
heavy horses

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
mango

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
have me know

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
have me know none

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
have you known what

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000

well do you know anybody that still has horses

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
that I can get some horses

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
no

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
dad

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
you're embarrassing me

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
I'm sorry about the horses gentlemen

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
with my barbarian impatience

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I just start marching off

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
towards the north and I say

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
where are the dwarves

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
the dwarves

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
lie

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
those filthy dwarves

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
lie to the east in their broken mountains

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
should we wrangle up dwarves

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
before we go to the north

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
let's just fucking go baby

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
who was it dealing with

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
he who travels fast just goes alone

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
except now we're going to go together

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
so we'll go at half speed

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
alright we head north into the sun

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
into the noon

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
into the I don't get it

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
well if you're heading east or west

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
it would be into the sunrise or sunset

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
oh the sun nothing

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
nice metal laugh

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
I thought it was funny

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
after I got it

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
but sincerity wasn't going to help

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
at that point

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
you're itch how far is the journey

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
toward the dark star encampment

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
it'll be several days

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
perhaps even

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
several weeks

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
we should probably stop at some town

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
and actually get horses at some point

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
is there a town

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
between here if we head north

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
will we come to a town

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
you guys hail from Thornvale right

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
yeah

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Thornvale is a little bit out of the way

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
but you might go there

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
otherwise if you go north

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
but there's a place called

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Fornheim the frozen city

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
no

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
not really

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
it's more directly north

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
it's more like the gateway

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
for the people of the extreme north

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Thornburg is the gateway

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
to Thornvale

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Fornheim

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Fornheim is for lovers

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I think is the slogan

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
the slogan is it's the frozen city

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
well I

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
where our buildings are frozen

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
well I have the armament of winter

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I should fit right in there

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
it'll be great when we get there

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
we head for Fornheim

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
you head for Fornheim

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
time passes

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
time passes

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
time passes

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
holy shit Fornheim

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
hey don't get ahead of yourself

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
there's possible random encounters

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
that might happen

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
before those random encounters happen

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
we should stop

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
we should have one random encounter

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
whatever you want

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
but this is going to be like something

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
there's wrestling at the bushes

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
there's spiders

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
there's eating gooey choxins

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
I know that's table talk

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
that's fine

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
there's no table

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I'm table talking with my friend

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
we should stop

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
you want to stop

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I'd love to stop

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
he hates it

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
he hates it

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
it's the worst

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I didn't expect to have such a long session

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I mean I have a little bit planned

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
but you know

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I see you just ran out of ideas

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
I'm running out

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
and it'll take about a week to get

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
all of the ideas

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
so we'll stop here

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
especially everybody

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Jeff what have we learned

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I've learned a lot tonight

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
yeah I thought you guys were going to go to the dwarves

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
so

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
we go to the dwarves

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
okay you find the dwarves

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
they say no

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
that's not what I had planned

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
I bang on their big dwarven door

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
and I go let me in

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
they don't

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
alright

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
we head back north

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
we head back to thornheim

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
thornheim what's it called

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
thorn f-o-r-n-h-e-i-m

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
thornheim

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
sounds like all they make is shoes

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
that's their main export

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
frozen shoes

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
that's their other slogan

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
who makes frozen shoes

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
it's for lovers of frozen shoes

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
all right

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
how do we end the show these days

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
we've been ending it the last couple weeks

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
on some kind of big event in Texas and Dragons

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
can you create like a

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
can we camp for the night

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
you camp for the night

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
okay and I

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
I

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
climb a tree

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
yeah you climb a tree

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
I go up to the top

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
of the highest tree

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
you can see all the planes

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
and rolling hills stretching out

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
before you

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I take a bunch of shovels and make a tree ladder

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
and go up

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
even though there's branches that he already climbed

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I'm just

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
kind of troubleshooting

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
my new invention

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
and you find it doesn't work

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
nearly as well in trees as it does

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I use branches where I need

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
me and I get up there with Sharpie

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
and we are at the canopy of the tree

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
and the camera orbits us

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
and it orbits from the front

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
of us where I put my arm around

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
my little friend Quark

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
it orbits around us

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
to where the sun is setting

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
above the edge of a

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
majestic

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
landscape of wonder

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
and mystery and other synonyms

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
for unknown things

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
and we kind of take in the majesty

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
and

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
and the music swells

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
as I say

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Quark

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
yeah

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
you may be little

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
but

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
you got a big

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
dick

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
