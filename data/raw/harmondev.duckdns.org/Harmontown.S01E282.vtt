Hey everybody welcome to Uptown Burbank\n\n04:58.240 --> 05:01.960\nHarmontown is now in the session\n\n05:01.960 --> 05:06.040\nAnd Zack you got a beat for me. No, what the fuck is that?\n\n05:06.040 --> 05:08.760\nI just a zackist a zackist\n\n05:09.560 --> 05:11.560\nNow yeah\n\n05:11.960 --> 05:16.560\nThis is a good format. That was exhilarating. We do it cold open. It might not go ahead. Go ahead\n\n05:16.560 --> 05:21.360\nNo, I will have different cold open. Sometimes we'll just see plot threats, but we'll have them\n\n05:21.360 --> 05:24.960\nI think that what we just did was\n\n05:25.760 --> 05:27.760\nadvertising history. Oh\n\n05:27.760 --> 05:34.240\nBy the way, I'm Jeff Davis your Comptroller. We're in Burbank Harmontown is now in session. Let's welcome Spencer Crittenden your game master\n\n05:34.440 --> 05:38.480\nYou might recognize him from the recent Santa Claus me and he's that\n\n05:39.400 --> 05:45.040\nAlso the star of Santa Claus and playing the role of Santa L. Claus\n\n05:45.720 --> 05:48.120\nThe mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon\n\n05:48.760 --> 05:54.000\nThank you. See it's already a better format because it didn't make I know and I knew it was never\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:58.080\nIt was never supposed to make sense what we were doing because we're performing for nobody\n\n05:58.080 --> 06:02.760\nMy thought was just do it, but make a little I like making a little tweak like that\n\n06:03.200 --> 06:09.280\nWe can do a cold open. I can already be sitting up here and then and then and then the music can play\n\n06:09.280 --> 06:13.360\nIt's a cold open. It feels professional and it's not really professional\n\n06:15.160 --> 06:17.160\nWith a capital P\n\n06:17.880 --> 06:20.120\nIf Harmontown can\n\n06:20.120 --> 06:24.920\nGuarantee one thing is professionalism of our pre-roll\n\n06:24.920 --> 06:31.600\nBut you know, I also think it would be funny. Remember when we were remember on Oscar night and we were like I\n\n06:32.840 --> 06:35.200\nWas like I got really excited for a second because\n\n06:35.680 --> 06:41.960\nWe're clearly the Oscars weren't even over much less had we seen them much less had we planned then I riffed the dumb\n\n06:42.160 --> 06:48.360\nSarcastic thing of like yeah, we've been rehearsing the show all month, but like we should just we should force ourselves\n\n06:48.360 --> 06:51.280\nBefore each show we should decide\n\n06:52.040 --> 06:56.240\nOr we could do it on stage, but there should always be a fake\n\n06:57.480 --> 07:04.560\nLike a there's it has to be a fake segment. There has to be a sketch. Yeah, all right. No, maybe not an opening\n\n07:04.560 --> 07:07.280\nBut we'll just get in that or like SNL\n\n07:07.280 --> 07:11.200\nWe have to come out and do our our Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n\n07:11.200 --> 07:16.760\nYeah, it's like it's coming. It's gonna it's happening tonight and we we refer to it or whatever. I don't know are you\n\n07:16.760 --> 07:21.200\nAre you suggesting we like just like think about the show at all?\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:27.200\nJust a little bit just that much that just enough to make it like willfully shittier\n\n07:27.200 --> 07:32.240\nWhich would make it better because it would be structurally no idea like like we'd enjoy that they'd enjoy that\n\n07:32.800 --> 07:35.800\nYeah, no, I think they'd enjoy more effort on our part\n\n07:35.800 --> 07:43.840\nYeah, especially the people that paid for it\n\n07:49.640 --> 07:51.640\nNo, I'm excited\n\n07:52.760 --> 07:58.560\nWe got here an hour early to talk about business affairs right and so we were here early and\n\n07:58.800 --> 08:03.680\nWe were kind of already warmed up. Yeah as opposed to just rolling in right at eight o'clock. Yeah\n\n08:03.680 --> 08:12.880\nYeah, your voice is warmed up. Nothing like talking about the podcast business to bring the spirit from your solar plexus up in dear joy chakra\n\n08:14.880 --> 08:18.040\nBecause we all do this to have a good time, but that that's actually true. I\n\n08:19.800 --> 08:21.800\nHad an epiphany in therapy\n\n08:22.600 --> 08:27.000\nAnd my therapist gave me a fist bump which she she doesn't usually\n\n08:27.640 --> 08:30.800\nYou know touch me and stuff and she she also kicked my foot\n\n08:30.800 --> 08:36.200\nLike like as she was getting up to schedule next week's appointment. She like kicked my foot like it's you\n\n08:37.520 --> 08:40.000\nShe called me. She said I was transcend\n\n08:40.720 --> 08:42.640\ntrans\n\n08:42.640 --> 08:44.640\nTransforming no\n\n08:46.480 --> 08:50.960\nSo I'm just trying to I've I've I've trans I'm transcending my\n\n08:54.280 --> 08:56.440\nRoll out my native\n\n08:56.440 --> 09:02.840\nYeah, fuck it you transcended your native what I don't know the thing that makes me naturally an asshole\n\n09:02.840 --> 09:07.040\nTell me or tell me more about your epiphany then well, it doesn't yeah\n\n09:07.040 --> 09:12.840\nI mean whatever she that that was just her report card. I and I don't I don't that's not that's not why I do therapy\n\n09:12.840 --> 09:19.840\nI don't do it to win. I would say but I won if my lesbian therapist reached across the table and fist bump me and then give me a\n\n09:19.840 --> 09:23.880\nLittle footsie kick. I would say that's that's certainly transformational\n\n09:23.880 --> 09:29.320\nRight, you have graduated and she's a married lesbian by the way for those who don't want Jesus Christ\n\n09:30.320 --> 09:32.320\nNo\n\n09:32.480 --> 09:34.480\nNo\n\n09:34.840 --> 09:36.840\nDear heaven\n\n09:37.640 --> 09:41.640\nBoy, damn was about to talk about a spiritual epiphany\n\n09:44.840 --> 09:46.840\nRob\n\n09:46.840 --> 09:53.640\nI'm in the house until it said a truck\n\n09:54.240 --> 09:56.240\nYes, Sarah needs you tonight\n\n09:56.920 --> 09:58.680\nHey\n\n09:58.680 --> 10:00.520\nWelcome\n\n10:00.520 --> 10:02.520\nto me\n\n10:04.040 --> 10:06.040\nWelcome\n\n10:06.560 --> 10:08.560\nTo you\n\n10:08.560 --> 10:19.880\nOh, you made a pretty brave entrance\n\n10:22.040 --> 10:26.680\nSteve said hey, you just walk up on stage. Well that people love that and\n\n10:27.520 --> 10:34.440\nNot it didn't go wrong at any point. It's it's it was it was just funny to watch you charge into the Lake, Michigan\n\n10:34.840 --> 10:36.840\non a banana leaf\n\n10:36.840 --> 10:41.000\nAnd like it could be a boogie board. It's probably not gonna be a boogie board\n\n10:43.240 --> 10:45.240\nIt's charged into it\n\n10:48.120 --> 10:54.560\nWell, I'm what did I interrupt spiritual journey you you've you've got something you got something he was transcending something\n\n10:54.720 --> 10:58.560\nWell, we open the show with a something I just came up with in the moment\n\n10:58.560 --> 11:03.160\nOh, let's hear it.

Well, we'll still they'll still get there much\n\n11:07.800 --> 11:11.880\nNo, no, no, they got their ad if what we did in the beginning was that's not good enough for me on these\n\n11:11.880 --> 11:15.880\nThen my me indies can go fuck themselves. Well, for all I'm wearing them right now\n\n11:15.880 --> 11:22.240\nThey might have paid for a middle of the podcast ad we don't all I'm saying is they're still gonna get whatever they paid\n\n11:22.240 --> 11:27.280\nI was at the march yesterday for our lives for the kids that don't want to get shot to death in schools\n\n11:27.280 --> 11:34.840\nAnd I I went through my me and these drawer and I was like, what's the right me and these underwear to wear at a march\n\n11:34.840 --> 11:37.000\nFor kids that don't want to get shot to death at school\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:42.920\nAnd I had them it's the ones with little peace signs, you know that the much loved ones were those cone\n\n11:42.920 --> 11:45.000\nI had my where's the peace sign\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:52.560\nThe peace fingers, you know, where's the peace fingers?

Well, yeah, I wore my actual gun control me and these they had like guns with X's on them for real\n\n12:20.760 --> 12:24.560\nYeah, no, so that's probably why it didn't work as you weren't wearing the right underwear\n\n12:25.560 --> 12:31.600\nDon't put what was your ad at the beginning of the show. It was a great Andy's ad. Yeah, I did I did like a\n\n12:32.160 --> 12:35.480\nDo well, why don't we just we'll run through it?

You see how Rob being in the scene just instantly plused it\n\n14:24.360 --> 14:30.320\nAgain sarcasm. No, that was honesty. That was proving that my past sarcasm was indeed honesty. I\n\n14:30.320 --> 14:35.160\nThink it's this that's making it feel sarcastic. It certainly makes me hard to read\n\n14:35.720 --> 14:38.960\nYeah, yeah, put your hands somewhere else. No\n\n14:41.480 --> 14:48.600\nSpencer always listening he's answering answering a call from like the 1970s talk to me. Hello 1970s\n\n14:48.600 --> 14:51.440\nThis is a McGillicuddy.

I'm so it's a cumulative effect\n\n16:11.760 --> 16:15.680\nSo if you get three sub brands, you'll have a total of 15% off brand\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:20.920\nRelated numbers. I have a coupon for motor voting put it\n\n16:20.920 --> 16:32.360\nYou put it in your life put it in Kmart\n\n16:32.360 --> 16:41.320\nOh no, it's me and these okay. All right, so that's how that would have gone right\n\n16:41.320 --> 16:51.720\nAll right, well the epiphany that I had in therapy was that uh, I\n\n16:54.240 --> 16:56.240\nYou're gay\n\n16:56.720 --> 16:58.720\nThere's uh\n\n16:59.360 --> 17:01.640\nNothing wrong with that every everybody\n\n17:02.680 --> 17:08.080\nIn the world no matter how far away they live from anyone else like\n\n17:08.880 --> 17:10.760\nwe're all like\n\n17:10.760 --> 17:17.400\nYou know, we're all in a crowded warehouse. You can't you can't move and not touching everybody\n\n17:17.400 --> 17:19.080\nIt's like if you go to\n\n17:19.080 --> 17:22.720\nAnything where there's a bunch of people like a crowded warehouse, right? Like a crowded warehouse\n\n17:27.800 --> 17:33.000\nI'm really undercutting my epiphany. It doesn't sound that good anymore. I'm just I'm totally listening\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.500\nbut but but I I I\n\n17:36.500 --> 17:42.060\nHave been making mistake of because if you if you if you pursue\n\n17:43.180 --> 17:48.220\nWhat you want like if you follow your goal like a like like whatever that goal is\n\n17:48.220 --> 17:49.820\nBut it can't be too complicated\n\n17:49.820 --> 17:51.140\nIt can't be for instance\n\n17:51.140 --> 17:53.140\nI got to get out of the warehouse\n\n17:53.220 --> 18:00.660\nBecause then you're just gonna get irritated because all you can really do in the in the foreseeable future is like move through a bunch of\n\n18:00.660 --> 18:05.820\nPeople but your goal might be like I want to get to the west side of the warehouse. I've never been over there\n\n18:05.820 --> 18:13.860\nAnd and but ultimately the whatever the goal is it all falls under the giant heading of I\n\n18:14.900 --> 18:16.900\nWant to be happy\n\n18:17.060 --> 18:19.060\nSo therefore\n\n18:19.380 --> 18:20.880\nAnd then you have these good goals\n\n18:20.880 --> 18:25.140\nSo the thing has to be not about the people that you're like\n\n18:25.820 --> 18:31.780\nThe then there's all this stuff. So you have to whenever you move through a crowd you you're constantly having to go\n\n18:31.940 --> 18:34.260\nExcuse me. Sorry. No, that's okay. That's all right\n\n18:34.260 --> 18:39.620\nThere's people it's just a mess, you know, people are a mess like we we we we\n\n18:40.220 --> 18:42.100\nwe just\n\n18:42.100 --> 18:47.500\nEveryone's at cross purposes and you're trying to be polite and graceful and you don't want to be a part of the problem\n\n18:47.500 --> 18:51.100\nAnd all of that stuff's happening and it's causing you like a lot of anxiety\n\n18:51.940 --> 18:56.100\nSo like my epiphany was that I I have been\n\n18:57.220 --> 19:02.700\nBecause of maybe like early on I was like, oh, wow, it's so this this is the worst part, right?\n\n19:02.700 --> 19:08.220\nIt's the part where you have to go like this. So what what can I do about that part?\n\n19:09.660 --> 19:13.060\nWhich made me feel like I was being in the moment and being\n\n19:15.340 --> 19:17.340\nLike aware\n\n19:18.340 --> 19:20.340\nbecause if\n\n19:20.420 --> 19:22.620\npeople who think about their goals are\n\n19:23.740 --> 19:28.180\nHeartless people because then they walk through everybody because they're going that way\n\n19:28.180 --> 19:35.500\nBut you don't have to choose between those two things like I was but the people who when we shrink back like that\n\n19:35.500 --> 19:39.380\nAnd we go, oh, I need my goal is I want to be the best person in the world\n\n19:39.380 --> 19:44.140\nI want to be I want to I want to not step on any toes and or\n\n19:44.660 --> 19:51.380\nIf someone steps on my fucking toe this time, you know, like that we get into those moods like I'm just gonna police my fucking like\n\n19:52.740 --> 19:55.260\nYou're drawn back into this like\n\n19:55.260 --> 20:00.820\nThing and then like you could do a lot of good that way you could even be like\n\n20:01.380 --> 20:04.620\nYou could become a kind of art installation because you could be like\n\n20:05.500 --> 20:11.460\nHere's what I'm gonna do because of the situation like I'm gonna stick my thumb in my mouth and like blow on it and like I\n\n20:12.020 --> 20:14.020\nlike like but it\n\n20:14.780 --> 20:20.340\nThis is the part where I can't bring it home, but I'm just saying like now I understand like\n\n20:20.340 --> 20:24.020\nThe people that I like are the people that\n\n20:25.020 --> 20:31.820\nThey don't they don't shrink back that far to the point where they're just doing what everyone's doing\n\n20:31.820 --> 20:36.560\nWhich is going I hope nobody hates me because if we all do that\n\n20:37.420 --> 20:41.660\nWell, maybe arguably that would be utopia, but like I\n\n20:44.380 --> 20:46.380\nThink we like I\n\n20:46.380 --> 20:51.020\nWant to like follow this meandering\n\n20:51.260 --> 20:54.820\nDot of I want to be happy and get better\n\n20:55.500 --> 21:03.780\nHaving accepted that any path takes you across everybody. I want to get better at saying excuse me and I'm sorry and\n\n21:04.300 --> 21:11.120\nYou're forgiven and oh no problem and excuse me. No, I didn't see are you saying like it's the\n\n21:11.120 --> 21:16.280\nIt's the like when you're when you're trying to navigate through that crowd\n\n21:16.280 --> 21:22.080\nAnd you're and you're trying really hard not to bump into anybody not to interact and not to step on anybody's toes\n\n21:22.080 --> 21:26.680\nBut also you don't want to touch sweaty people or anything like that. That's what's making you\n\n21:27.240 --> 21:31.280\nNot happy or miserable and you should just learn to kind of like be okay\n\n21:31.880 --> 21:38.200\nBumping into being touched or or like oh hey, how you doing or being is that what you're saying or is enjoying?\n\n21:38.200 --> 21:44.640\nWell, I'm using as a model and saying like you know first of all no wrong answers except for each individual\n\n21:44.640 --> 21:51.080\nSo let's say that you don't like the let's say that that's like you're so there's some people that go to a concert because they genuinely\n\n21:51.080 --> 21:53.080\nWant to like fucking like?\n\n21:53.560 --> 22:00.920\nRub up against people or be even be punched by them or risk that factor like there's there's just and then there's\n\n22:00.920 --> 22:07.960\nSerial predators who are flocked to the situations of a crowd because they can grope you and pretend\n\n22:07.960 --> 22:12.800\nThey're not it's not their fault or like like there's there's no value to this situation\n\n22:12.960 --> 22:17.860\nLike there's no good and evil observable. You just zoom in on the individual\n\n22:18.480 --> 22:24.280\nAre you within this writhing sea of people that you can't escape?\n\n22:24.280 --> 22:34.280\nAre you going to define your entire life by the moment-to-moment like oh?\n\n22:35.760 --> 22:38.880\nThat guy wouldn't have done that if you had any respect for me\n\n22:38.880 --> 22:43.680\nAnd I stole I just hurt that person more than I should have and I said literally out of the others\n\n22:43.680 --> 22:50.960\nIt's like you're talking emotional and physical like like like like like emotional interactions or simply physical interactions\n\n22:50.960 --> 22:54.400\nI'm talking about I'm talking about down in the\n\n22:55.840 --> 23:00.360\nEncounter-to-encounter level of your right human existence\n\n23:00.360 --> 23:05.920\nAnd then not pulling back to the size of a planet so that you become a nihilist and go sheeps to the slaughter\n\n23:05.920 --> 23:13.560\nGive me more bacon and forensic file like I'm saying like if you pull back to a resolution\n\n23:13.560 --> 23:20.280\nThat's like one person's anxiety about every encounter they have to have as they move through life\n\n23:20.280 --> 23:28.080\nAs one corpuscle in a stream of them or one cockroach in a nest of them or one of like like like pick\n\n23:28.080 --> 23:32.920\nWhatever beautiful or a disgusting thing you want to say we're part of a biomass\n\n23:33.360 --> 23:38.920\nSo if you pull back a couple of those human units not a thousand not a million\n\n23:38.920 --> 23:41.640\nbut just like ten or something like\n\n23:42.160 --> 23:47.840\nthe amount of energy it takes to decide that you want to leave a party because\n\n23:47.840 --> 23:49.840\nyou\n\n23:49.880 --> 23:51.880\nDon't like it like\n\n23:52.680 --> 23:59.640\nWell in order to do that, I'd have to like I might be so intent on leaving this party that I'm gonna end up hurting\n\n24:00.160 --> 24:01.680\nlike you\n\n24:01.680 --> 24:08.200\nYou could just charge out you could charge out the door metaphorically you could like knock over coffee tables not to mention\n\n24:08.400 --> 24:12.240\nstep on someone's toe without apologizing and or and then\n\n24:12.240 --> 24:20.400\nLike even God imagine like the Irish goodbye factor of like I didn't even the Susan was upstairs taking a shit when I left\n\n24:20.400 --> 24:24.480\nAnd I don't know yeah, you said bye to me and not taking a be lying out the door is\n\n24:25.400 --> 24:30.240\nYeah, like I've always considered it. It's a dichotomy between\n\n24:30.960 --> 24:34.160\nthere's a binary choice between total self-interest and\n\n24:34.680 --> 24:38.440\nAltruism, but it was that was not true\n\n24:38.440 --> 24:44.480\nit was a binary choice between living a life of total self-paralyzing anxiety and\n\n24:46.120 --> 24:48.320\nKnowing who the fuck I am right\n\n24:49.200 --> 24:51.200\nLike because this is easy\n\n24:51.520 --> 24:57.120\nBeing anxious going everybody hates me. Everybody loves me. I hope I don't do that\n\n24:57.840 --> 25:03.240\nAgain, it's like it's like I'm like that's my excuse to like do nothing and go nowhere\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.600\nSo have you put that into play like no\n\n25:06.600 --> 25:08.600\nI\n\n25:09.480 --> 25:11.480\nJust thought of it like Friday\n\n25:12.840 --> 25:19.360\nBut well, how about us? Can you put that into play? Can you like activate that part of you?\n\n25:19.560 --> 25:24.880\nWell, I opened the show with a Christmas ad from Yundee's fucking did I had a\n\n25:25.440 --> 25:31.020\nEpiphany with my therapist this week. You found out she was my therapist. No, and then I paid\n\n25:31.520 --> 25:33.520\non you. It's a different therapist\n\n25:33.520 --> 25:35.020\nUh\n\n25:35.020 --> 25:37.020\nYou're spying on Rob through your\n\n25:40.120 --> 25:46.320\nYou paid a therapist like somehow like you did like a fucking inception thing or no not inception\n\n25:46.320 --> 25:49.880\nSir, that goes against the game Michael Douglas thing that led them to their\n\n25:49.880 --> 25:51.880\nThat goes against my Hippocratic Earth\n\n25:52.480 --> 25:57.640\nEverybody has a price. Yeah, and you've paid so much that she's just now gathering shit on a draw\n\n25:57.640 --> 26:02.520\nYeah, or or honestly if they're a therapist and they said like don't you think this is kind of unhealthy?\n\n26:02.520 --> 26:06.000\nYou all you have to do is say or is it so healthy?\n\n26:06.840 --> 26:08.840\nDot dot dot and then they'd be like\n\n26:09.720 --> 26:11.720\nMe there. I\n\n26:12.080 --> 26:16.960\nRequired to consider that possibility. I'm a therapist. What was your epiphany Schrab? Well\n\n26:17.600 --> 26:23.720\nI think it's similar to what you're saying if I'm hearing you right Dan. It's like because I was like I've been\n\n26:24.240 --> 26:29.760\nTelling her about like what I'm going through like creatively and how I'm just like I wake up every morning going\n\n26:29.760 --> 26:35.960\nIt's over with and I'm tired and I'm just sad and I just I don't have the juice anymore\n\n26:35.960 --> 26:38.240\nAnd it's not fun and and she says oh\n\n26:38.680 --> 26:42.160\nIt's like if I'm alone and I'd Kate's been out of town all week\n\n26:42.160 --> 26:48.080\nSo I've been really kind of phone just like phoning in my life and sleeping all day and eating like shit\n\n26:48.080 --> 26:52.080\nAnd I just have like the voices in my head are just being very the critical mind\n\n26:52.080 --> 26:58.000\nYeah, the critical mind is like just like you know on overload and and so she she was like saying that\n\n26:58.000 --> 26:59.320\nlike\n\n26:59.320 --> 27:01.320\nthe critical mind is is\n\n27:02.160 --> 27:06.680\nWell, it goes back to being like like the lizard brain in your head where it's like saying\n\n27:07.720 --> 27:09.720\nStay in your cave\n\n27:09.960 --> 27:16.880\nStay away from the unknown. Keep your belly full. Don't take any chances risk averse\n\n27:17.200 --> 27:22.080\nYeah, exactly. Don't do any of that because it's because it's edit and it makes you\n\n27:22.080 --> 27:29.120\nTo survive the biological Fed has set the interest rates higher, right, right to speak and\n\n27:30.280 --> 27:32.120\nlike add like\n\n27:32.120 --> 27:39.920\nLike like that's all like our like ancient, you know primitive instincts already in our head then add on top of like trying to\n\n27:40.360 --> 27:47.200\nBeing socially domesticated and all that and voices of your parents and teachers capitalism. Yeah. Yeah, and so so\n\n27:47.480 --> 27:49.480\nShe was like she was like\n\n27:49.480 --> 27:55.240\nShe was like saying like could you befriend that voice in your head? You know, could you befriend it because\n\n27:56.240 --> 28:01.880\nReally that friend that voice in your head is a friend is somebody who cares about you\n\n28:01.880 --> 28:07.200\nThat's only trying to protect you like when they say what it when it's like, don't don't dream too big\n\n28:07.480 --> 28:14.720\nDon't dream too big or you're you know, like because why why is that voice telling you that because it doesn't want your heart to get broken\n\n28:14.720 --> 28:16.720\nbut in order to\n\n28:16.720 --> 28:24.160\nAchieve what you really want to do. You have to risk right that and and and and so\n\n28:24.520 --> 28:26.520\nyou know if you could\n\n28:27.280 --> 28:31.240\nHave a conversation with that voice in your head and say hey\n\n28:31.840 --> 28:39.120\nListen, thank you. I'm sorry. It was so angry about trying to push you away. I should embrace you\n\n28:40.320 --> 28:42.640\nI know you're all I was just trying to help\n\n28:44.320 --> 28:45.840\nBruce Willis\n\n28:45.840 --> 28:50.320\nBruce Willis. Yeah, I know you're trying to look out for me\n\n28:50.320 --> 28:56.320\nYeah, but sometimes I got a run over the glass. Yeah, don't you ever think that Bruce Willis is your critical voice?\n\n28:56.320 --> 28:58.840\nMaybe you should take seriously. Yeah\n\n28:59.360 --> 29:03.440\nNo, no, I should I should I mean if Bruce Willis was my critical voice\n\n29:03.440 --> 29:07.400\nI would be like this whole towers gonna go down buddy. Yeah\n\n29:09.360 --> 29:11.960\nWhat do you want me to do just sit here and watch it happen\n\n29:11.960 --> 29:16.760\nNo, I don't want you to I don't want you to sit there. I want you to what what do I do?\n\n29:16.760 --> 29:18.760\nWhat I don't know. I'm asking me\n\n29:19.560 --> 29:21.000\nhold tight\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nwait for the police\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nIt's a Hudson Hawk trailer\n\n29:32.040 --> 29:38.880\nWell, I thought I was trying to be poignant in that the the critical voice that doesn't it's not always the noid from\n\n29:38.880 --> 29:45.080\nThat that's the thing is like I think that's what we're afraid of of confronting is that like oh, yeah\n\n29:45.080 --> 29:47.480\nBut my critical voice is actually it's not\n\n29:49.120 --> 29:51.120\nUgly booger man from a car\n\n29:51.440 --> 29:56.240\nLot commercial or it's like I hate high prices or low prices or whatever that guy would hate\n\n29:56.240 --> 30:01.200\nIt's more like the little seeds. He probably hates high prices. Hey, I hate I love high prices\n\n30:01.200 --> 30:03.200\nOh, I love them or I am high\n\n30:03.200 --> 30:10.680\nWell, a booger a booger man would probably hate low prices. I think I this is from if you haven't seen it watch the\n\n30:11.920 --> 30:14.960\nEarly Robert Zemeckis film starring Kurt Russell used cars\n\n30:15.360 --> 30:19.360\nThey do a commercial in it and the guy has to play high prices\n\n30:20.280 --> 30:22.780\nOh, yeah, does he play it? I\n\n30:23.800 --> 30:26.320\nThink he's like I remember him is looking like a\n\n30:27.160 --> 30:28.400\nFruit of the loom guy\n\n30:28.400 --> 30:33.280\nI can't I can't remember what the costume was we had like come out and then like they did like a squib effect like\n\n30:34.560 --> 30:39.640\nLike like high prices fuck you and they like they blow them up with a shotgun or whatever\n\n30:39.640 --> 30:45.160\nAnd it's all like squibs and blood and stuff and you know, it's like these guys are underdogs like they're\n\n30:45.920 --> 30:47.920\nThey're they're too effective\n\n30:48.640 --> 30:51.040\nThat's selling used cars. Yeah\n\n30:51.560 --> 30:53.560\nThey're too effective\n\n30:53.560 --> 31:00.320\nSo, yeah, so I mean putting it that way like befriending the critical mind and realizing that\n\n31:00.880 --> 31:06.200\nIt's it it's actually something that doesn't hate you and doesn't want you to fail\n\n31:06.400 --> 31:12.360\nIt's just trying to protect you and so if when that voice or that that attitude is in your head\n\n31:14.440 --> 31:19.120\nShe's a get into the habit of saying thank you I understand\n\n31:20.440 --> 31:22.440\nGo fuck yourself\n\n31:22.440 --> 31:27.560\nYou know being being nice just like I understand trying to help me here\n\n31:28.080 --> 31:30.080\nbut this and\n\n31:30.400 --> 31:37.160\nUsually I would like pay attention to you like not run out into traffic, you know not eat bad food or it's time to get out\n\n31:37.160 --> 31:41.200\nOf bed or whatever, but this is a time where I need to risk\n\n31:41.920 --> 31:47.460\nBeing hurt. I think the pain is worth it. So I'm gonna need you to just\n\n31:47.460 --> 31:54.220\nTrust me on this one and then and if in the voice, you know, we if you know it well enough will go, okay\n\n31:54.900 --> 32:02.340\nI'm here if you need me, you know, just that that's beautiful. I love that and it really it started thinking of it that way it really started\n\n32:02.700 --> 32:04.220\nkind of\n\n32:04.220 --> 32:09.780\nReprogramming here. I can think like that's a wonderful idea like like I used to draw a lot\n\n32:09.780 --> 32:13.260\nBut I don't draw anymore because the reason I don't draw is I think I'm mad at it now\n\n32:13.260 --> 32:17.340\nYeah, because something in your head saying, so why are you doing? Why are you doing this?\n\n32:17.340 --> 32:20.060\nYou know, you're just gonna draw the same stupid shit you always draw\n\n32:20.380 --> 32:23.700\nBut I need to befriend that voice and say well, let's just try\n\n32:24.220 --> 32:26.940\nYeah, let's let's let's what's the worst thing that could happen\n\n32:26.940 --> 32:29.780\nThe only way to get better at it is to keep practicing it\n\n32:29.780 --> 32:35.540\nSo why don't you be quiet for a bit or watch me or if I fail guess what you're right?\n\n32:35.540 --> 32:40.820\nYeah, but who cares the same or tell me how to make it better. Yeah, you know like say like if it's like\n\n32:40.820 --> 32:47.180\nOh, you're you're cross hatching is bad or you're just okay. Well, that's something I will concentrate on instead of just like going\n\n32:47.660 --> 32:53.540\nIt's over with don't even try because that's that's what what the lizard brain is trying to do\n\n32:53.540 --> 32:54.540\nIt's like yeah\n\n32:54.540 --> 32:56.540\nDon't go into the dark forest\n\n32:56.540 --> 33:01.580\nWell, a lot of times we get programmed to go like you got a you got a you got a punch that\n\n33:01.860 --> 33:07.380\nNo, you can't voice in the face and you're and it's like that actually could be the\n\n33:07.380 --> 33:11.580\nThat lizard like to the extent that it wants you\n\n33:12.860 --> 33:19.860\nMitigated ie like that's what a that's what a sheep dog does it's like kind of vaguely threatens the sheep because it loves them\n\n33:19.860 --> 33:23.540\nWants to keep them in a certain area. Yeah along a certain path and so\n\n33:24.140 --> 33:30.180\nGetting mad at it actually is part of its function. Whereas if if you were a sheep and you wanted to\n\n33:31.060 --> 33:33.820\nYou know, maybe supersede a sheep dog's authority\n\n33:33.820 --> 33:38.380\nbecause maybe you're a sheep that wants to herd to go in a different direction the\n\n33:39.100 --> 33:41.900\nactual practical thing to do would be to not like\n\n33:42.540 --> 33:43.900\nTangle with the sheep dog\n\n33:43.900 --> 33:50.340\nBut to like go around behind it and bid a good day and well be nice to it. What you want me to go over here\n\n33:50.340 --> 33:54.340\nOkay, it sounds like a good idea because you probably how long have you been a sheep dog?\n\n33:54.460 --> 33:57.620\nLike like like it's kind of you kind of crazy because you look kind of like a sheep\n\n33:57.620 --> 34:00.140\nLike your fur is like my friend, but they don't turn yours in the sweaters\n\n34:00.140 --> 34:06.760\nHow is that is that Jeremy over there? And you just kind of like you're not enemies with the critical voice the threshold guardians can be tamed by\n\n34:07.580 --> 34:11.700\nAssimilation I think that there's like on a pseudo scientific level or whatever\n\n34:11.700 --> 34:15.540\nI think that you're what you're talking about is the survival mechanism\n\n34:16.220 --> 34:19.980\nassociated with firefly which is associated with heightened state of emotion states of panic\n\n34:19.980 --> 34:25.460\nYeah, and I think that when you engage in an emotional angry traumatic way to those\n\n34:25.460 --> 34:32.420\nFeelings on an emotional level like you would if someone is telling you your shit everything it gets you into a more emotional state\n\n34:32.420 --> 34:37.140\nWhich is more prone to that part of your brain whereas what you're describing is a very rational\n\n34:37.140 --> 34:41.540\nIt's the other part of your mind the societal kind of control part of your mind. That's that's not at all\n\n34:41.540 --> 34:46.820\nIt's divorced from that that lizard part and it sounds like you're intentionally not trying to\n\n34:47.380 --> 34:55.380\nChannel those pathways that reinforce what what the negative stuff is saying and you're you're instead choosing pathways that take you away from that\n\n34:55.380 --> 34:58.260\nSo you're out when you say you're reprogramming. It's what you're doing\n\n34:58.260 --> 35:04.100\nIt sounds like is actively reprogramming the way you're thinking. Yeah, it's also a very subtle simple idea is that?\n\n35:04.580 --> 35:06.140\nbefriend\n\n35:06.140 --> 35:12.340\nThe part of you that argues with yourself because the thing that you think hates yourself when you get like a lot of people are going\n\n35:12.340 --> 35:16.980\nOh, I hate myself or whatever because the critical mind is like going through every little\n\n35:17.580 --> 35:22.980\nPiece of your life every second of your life going you did that wrong fucked up. What a new you're gonna wear that\n\n35:22.980 --> 35:28.660\nWhat's that on your face? It sounds like a fan. That sounds like a big fan. Yeah. Yeah, you've got like a reddit in your head\n\n35:29.700 --> 35:32.660\nThat is like saying everything you do is a comment section or whatever\n\n35:33.060 --> 35:39.460\nBut but yeah, but the the the reality is is those those voices and run reddit are your biggest fans\n\n35:39.540 --> 35:42.740\nOtherwise, they wouldn't be paying attention to every second of your life\n\n35:42.740 --> 35:50.580\nBut the a lot of us, um, you know, well just speaking of me we were I mean, we're all we're all monkey dogs when we come out of our\n\n35:50.580 --> 35:59.460\nMothers and we're just eating food and rolling around and we wouldn't dress or bathe unless somebody went no stop it, you know, and so\n\n36:00.260 --> 36:02.740\nYou're you learn how to become a\n\n36:03.500 --> 36:08.960\nCivilized human being by being told no stop it Robbie. No now stop it\n\n36:09.220 --> 36:14.500\nNo, do you have to do that? And it's like you hear that voice over and over and over again and that was\n\n36:14.900 --> 36:20.100\nThat's programmed into your head and still into adulthood. I hear my mom's voice going no\n\n36:20.100 --> 36:22.580\nOh, you're lazy stop doing and this was\n\n36:23.380 --> 36:28.100\nThis is just her way of saying I'm worried. Yeah, you're not hear that voice when you're\n\n36:29.140 --> 36:32.020\nDoing something has nothing to do with the things that she was in charge of\n\n36:32.100 --> 36:38.260\nYeah, just keeping you from falling downstairs walking to the street touching hot stoves like it's not even that person anymore\n\n36:38.260 --> 36:41.860\nAnd I'm not that that she was you only had that relationship with that stuff\n\n36:41.860 --> 36:45.140\nBut then it's called toxic shame when it's like misappropriated\n\n36:45.140 --> 36:53.460\nBut it's very much like like when lolly is barking at a skateboard that goes by I've learned to what is this thing?\n\n36:53.540 --> 36:56.580\nYeah, I learned that if I clap my hands\n\n36:57.540 --> 37:02.180\nShe'll like go like like she'll like flinch and she'll stop barking\n\n37:03.060 --> 37:09.140\nAnd so like if I so now whenever she does anything bad like I'll clap my hands not even\n\n37:09.540 --> 37:12.180\nHard and I'll be on the other side of the room and she knows that that's\n\n37:12.180 --> 37:17.540\nTime to stop, you know, so I'm her critical mind now every time\n\n37:18.100 --> 37:23.780\nShe thinks she's doing something that she's gonna be in her head thinking like and if she wanted to succeed as an animal\n\n37:23.940 --> 37:26.740\nShe would learn to befriend of that critical mind\n\n37:27.300 --> 37:33.220\nPerhaps fetch its balls once in a while and then one fateful day eat its throat in its sleep\n\n37:34.020 --> 37:37.540\nAnd go into wait, that's a girl. That's over the line to me\n\n37:38.180 --> 37:40.180\nKilling me. Yeah, I'm gonna\n\n37:40.180 --> 37:43.220\nSo I'm killing me is over the line. Yeah, it's a\n\n37:44.980 --> 37:48.020\nYou're reacting like I like I said something bad about\n\n37:48.900 --> 37:50.900\nLike I made a joke about hurting an animal\n\n37:51.460 --> 37:56.500\nYou're the oh, I'm I'm a I'm your friend. All right. All right. Okay. All right\n\n37:57.300 --> 37:59.540\nWell, uh, the boot the the boot uh\n\n38:00.820 --> 38:02.420\nSpencer\n\n38:02.420 --> 38:04.100\nHey\n\n38:04.100 --> 38:07.060\nDo you do you ever hear the story of the Christmas without underwear?\n\n38:08.020 --> 38:09.220\nOh\n\n38:09.220 --> 38:11.220\nNo\n\n38:12.420 --> 38:16.420\nThere's an old story about it. What the fuck is happening to\n\n38:19.140 --> 38:21.140\nHello little children\n\n38:23.460 --> 38:26.420\nThere'll be no underwear for Christmas this year\n\n38:28.100 --> 38:30.100\nYes, I'm sorry to say\n\n38:30.740 --> 38:37.300\nAll the underwear is made out of the horrible shit cotton and not even close to micro modell\n\n38:37.300 --> 38:39.300\nOh, yeah, so\n\n38:39.940 --> 38:46.340\nUh, no Christmas this time. Oh, no, my balls are rubbing up against this not diamond shaped pouch. Oh, what?\n\n38:46.340 --> 39:11.620\nI'm dead 500 years later\n\n39:11.620 --> 39:15.700\nAnd that was a story about the Christmas with no underwear\n\n39:16.740 --> 39:19.540\nUh grandfather. Yes\n\n39:20.420 --> 39:25.700\nWhat under garments could they have wand had well, they could have had\n\n39:28.020 --> 39:30.020\nBeyondies\n\n39:32.100 --> 39:34.100\nNeil Young is that you? Yeah\n\n39:34.100 --> 39:36.100\nIs\n\n39:39.780 --> 39:41.780\nBut there's a buddhist\n\n39:42.340 --> 39:47.780\nParable, I don't know of what I speak it comes to me courtesy of my therapist\n\n39:49.620 --> 39:53.380\nIt's the the thing that you're we're talking about we're talking about befriending the critical mind\n\n39:53.380 --> 39:57.540\nThere's also like the you know, it's this there was this goddess\n\n39:57.540 --> 40:03.460\nUh named Mara. I think who at some point where the buddha was\n\n40:04.180 --> 40:08.100\nDoing his thing on the tree which was like taking a shit ignoring everything\n\n40:08.820 --> 40:13.540\nAnd then there was like temptations and things and there was a goddess named Mara that was particularly like kind of\n\n40:14.260 --> 40:16.660\nYou know tried to get in his head and um\n\n40:17.780 --> 40:21.780\nThe phrase I see you Mara like you don't have to be like go fuck yourself\n\n40:21.780 --> 40:28.100\nDie by fire or whatever like you just like you actually acknowledge you feed the troll\n\n40:28.740 --> 40:32.340\nUh sometimes. Yeah, maybe all the time. I just got like yeah\n\n40:33.380 --> 40:36.740\nI I I I my my my erstwhile\n\n40:38.100 --> 40:40.100\ntrainer Dave Kline said of\n\n40:40.660 --> 40:42.660\npeople who troll\n\n40:42.740 --> 40:44.900\nlike something I thought was kind of profound which was\n\n40:46.100 --> 40:49.060\nActually, even those people they're just trying to connect with you\n\n40:49.060 --> 40:52.660\nWhich is different from from giving them credit for doing anything\n\n40:53.620 --> 40:58.260\nSmart or funny or cool. You can still like look down on them and go you're a dumb piece of shit\n\n40:58.580 --> 41:04.500\nThat's that's would that that is choosing this method to try in some ways to connect with me\n\n41:05.140 --> 41:11.780\nLike like there's absolutely no like they might be lost to cynicism and like all this shit, but like\n\n41:11.780 --> 41:20.980\nIt you got to admit they're like still there's like that's their disease that they're going like I wish I had an effect on you\n\n41:21.060 --> 41:24.340\nYeah, just like kind of kind of uh uplifting\n\n41:24.660 --> 41:30.100\nIt it is it's interesting because whenever you hear that critical mind\n\n41:30.820 --> 41:39.220\nVoice in your head in whatever form it is your first instinct is to go shut up. Leave me alone go away\n\n41:39.220 --> 41:43.700\nAnd a way to deal with it and it never works. It always comes back\n\n41:43.780 --> 41:47.700\nBut a way to deal with it is to when it when it goes\n\n41:48.260 --> 41:53.460\nYou're a piece of shit. Why are you? Why aren't you working right now? If you would just like say\n\n41:54.820 --> 41:58.740\nOkay, hold on. Why are you saying that to me? I work an awful lot, but why\n\n41:59.460 --> 42:02.980\nWhy right now any jobs you want me to have as many as it takes, you know\n\n42:02.980 --> 42:07.460\nIt's like like it's asking it what it wants. Yeah, what do you want? What would make you happy?\n\n42:07.460 --> 42:09.780\nWhat would make you critical mind?\n\n42:10.580 --> 42:12.180\nstop\n\n42:12.180 --> 42:16.980\nLike saying that to me just to sexy me by the way instead of it's it's Maya not Mara Maya means illusion\n\n42:17.300 --> 42:22.180\nOh, okay. It's Maya. I hear you. That's amazing that it means illusion like the software\n\n42:23.140 --> 42:26.260\nYeah, like like the animation software the illusion software\n\n42:28.660 --> 42:32.260\nIt makes it make yeah, I make stuff that isn't real. Yeah, I guess sorry\n\n42:32.260 --> 42:34.260\nThat's not true. It wasn't a punch\n\n42:35.540 --> 42:40.500\nI'm trying to I'm tabulating in my head. I'm like did my therapist fuck up that name or did I?\n\n42:42.020 --> 42:47.060\nBut I don't know why I would you said Mara and I I just shot a granted church because if anybody would know it in the\n\n42:47.060 --> 42:48.900\nBuilding it would be her and she was like\n\n42:48.900 --> 42:51.540\nYeah, she shook you off like Johnny bench sure\n\n42:52.900 --> 42:54.900\nOh, you do\n\n42:54.900 --> 43:03.460\nI see I see I see you illusion. Yeah, that actually makes it more profound instead of creating like just another like crazy lady character\n\n43:04.580 --> 43:11.700\nUh, yeah, that's interesting. Uh, yeah, wait church. You want to come up and talk about like photographing the the march, uh, uh\n\n43:13.140 --> 43:15.140\nBring up church\n\n43:15.700 --> 43:21.860\nChorts she's charts. If you're a starbucks person from columbia, she's charts\n\n43:21.860 --> 43:25.380\nBecause they don't know how to spell church\n\n43:28.820 --> 43:30.740\nHello, hello\n\n43:30.740 --> 43:32.740\nwith the with the the of course the\n\n43:33.380 --> 43:39.780\nTerms of service agreement that all guests check which is that at any time you may say a word or syllable that makes me launch into a\n\n43:40.340 --> 43:41.860\nsputtering\n\n43:41.860 --> 43:43.860\nrant about how I'm not racist\n\n43:43.860 --> 43:51.540\nBut uh, we were yeah, we went down to the march and uh, I kind of I just I thought it was I\n\n43:52.100 --> 43:56.100\nI I don't know. I don't know how to tee you up. I'm not a good tear\n\n43:56.500 --> 43:59.540\nBut uh, because I don't want to make you feel pretentious and say like church\n\n43:59.540 --> 44:02.900\nWhy don't you talk about how profound the imagery you captured was?\n\n44:03.220 --> 44:09.380\nBut it was like but but actually just like I thought it was cool you talking about how it was sort of like ducks in a barrel\n\n44:09.380 --> 44:13.620\nUh for photographers because of the simplicity of the theme you want to go from there?\n\n44:14.260 --> 44:17.540\nWell, yeah, I mean what I noticed in what was making me so emotional\n\n44:17.700 --> 44:23.300\nI mean aside from just what was actually happening, which is seeing so many kids and even really really little kids\n\n44:24.020 --> 44:25.860\nmarching and\n\n44:25.860 --> 44:27.700\nangry and\n\n44:27.700 --> 44:29.380\nthoughtfully\n\n44:29.380 --> 44:33.780\nexpressing that anger and having these brilliant signs that\n\n44:33.780 --> 44:39.140\nI just I could I could not stop crying when you guys walked past me at a certain point\n\n44:39.140 --> 44:43.380\nI stopped and just stood there and let the crowd kind of like move toward me and around me\n\n44:43.940 --> 44:49.060\nBecause that's the the best way to see everything because if you keep just marching with the crowd as a photographer\n\n44:49.140 --> 44:52.980\nYou're you're surrounded by the same 20 people as you move down the street\n\n44:53.060 --> 44:57.780\nSo for me, I I I stop at some point and that just seemed like the right place to stop but\n\n44:59.300 --> 45:02.420\nAll the other protests that I've photographed\n\n45:02.420 --> 45:08.420\nIf you looked at all those photos together would look like they could be any protests because you see\n\n45:09.540 --> 45:14.420\nA lot of the same signs because we have so there's so much intersectionality with all of these issues\n\n45:14.500 --> 45:16.900\nThere's so many issues happening at the same time\n\n45:17.780 --> 45:24.340\nAnd so you're seeing the same things all the time. There's always the the rainbow afro guy with the john 319\n\n45:24.660 --> 45:27.160\nIt's all the 360. I love john 319\n\n45:27.940 --> 45:29.940\nDoesn't get enough play\n\n45:29.940 --> 45:31.940\nFor god also doesn't love the people\n\n45:33.460 --> 45:35.940\nHe all he loved them. He also didn't\n\n45:37.380 --> 45:40.260\nSorry, I was I was trying to interject very quickly\n\n45:40.580 --> 45:47.140\nCan just you've been to a lot of these how big we was the big right? It was big. I haven't seen the final numbers\n\n45:47.220 --> 45:52.580\nBut the thing that takes them a few days to tabulate and kind of estimate the crowd size, but it seemed it seemed really big\n\n45:52.740 --> 45:56.820\nThere were over 800,000 in dc. That's the only number I know so far\n\n45:57.380 --> 45:58.420\nbut\n\n45:58.420 --> 46:00.420\nbecause the point was that\n\n46:01.220 --> 46:06.180\nThis was the the only protests that for me in pictures. You know exactly what it is\n\n46:06.980 --> 46:14.180\nAnd it's completely on one topic right there's nothing else being talked about and you can see that in just the images\n\n46:14.420 --> 46:19.700\nAnd even if you like let's take partisan politics aside and people say that I hate the\n\n46:20.900 --> 46:25.300\nThe g.o.p. Or I'm a total liberal or like I'm anti or pro n.r.a\n\n46:25.300 --> 46:28.580\nIf you just look at the the children that were there\n\n46:29.140 --> 46:32.420\nThe expressions on their faces were different than other protests\n\n46:32.580 --> 46:39.060\nThey looked scared and pissed off and I like what if like I'm trying to picture myself if I were\n\n46:41.380 --> 46:45.780\nThirteen 14 16 18 I was still in school\n\n46:46.740 --> 46:51.380\nWhat side would I fall on and how angry would I be in which direction?\n\n46:51.940 --> 46:53.380\nI might have been\n\n46:53.380 --> 46:56.580\nThe pro second amendment guy. I might have been the\n\n46:57.380 --> 47:01.780\nFuck the second amendment guy. I don't know but watching kids\n\n47:02.740 --> 47:05.620\nLook fucking miserable and looked really\n\n47:06.820 --> 47:09.140\nThere's a couple on church's instagram\n\n47:10.020 --> 47:13.220\nThere's that last one. There's no sign the girl might have just been tired\n\n47:13.940 --> 47:16.100\nShe might just be a kid that was tired of being in a march\n\n47:16.500 --> 47:21.220\nBut there's a picture of her looking right at camera and she just looks fucking sad\n\n47:21.220 --> 47:24.500\nAnd I look at those photos and I just start crying\n\n47:25.220 --> 47:27.220\nbecause\n\n47:27.220 --> 47:28.180\num\n\n47:28.180 --> 47:29.940\nI put myself\n\n47:29.940 --> 47:31.940\nin those little shoes\n\n47:32.260 --> 47:33.940\nand\n\n47:33.940 --> 47:38.740\nI don't give a fuck what you think about gun rights or gun legislation or whatever\n\n47:39.380 --> 47:44.980\nThere's a bunch of fucking kids that are afraid to go to school. I have a niece that's fucking eight and I've got\n\n47:44.980 --> 47:52.500\nFriends that are like have children that are going to school and let's not make it about politics or make it about trump\n\n47:52.500 --> 47:54.980\nOr make it about paul ryan. Who's a cunt?\n\n47:55.940 --> 47:57.940\nSorry, I meant to say cunt\n\n48:02.260 --> 48:08.340\nWhat what's happening is like imagine being a kid going to the mall now going to a movie theater like it's fucking crazy\n\n48:08.340 --> 48:15.620\nWe shouldn't make celebrities out of emigrant solace for being the first cool chick to get up and say a bunch of awesome stuff\n\n48:15.860 --> 48:18.980\nI think that's dangerous. I think like that puts her in a bad situation\n\n48:19.460 --> 48:24.420\nBut I think that you should go around and look at church's photos and look at the kids that were marching that day\n\n48:24.980 --> 48:26.100\num\n\n48:26.100 --> 48:28.100\nThey're scared. They're the friends are dying\n\n48:28.420 --> 48:33.860\nThey're scared. They really are and my nephews were going to march and then my sister texted me\n\n48:33.860 --> 48:39.060\nOn friday night and she said that my my nephews had kind of had a little bit of a panic attack about it\n\n48:39.060 --> 48:42.820\nThat they wanted so much to be a part of it, but that they were really scared to go to the march\n\n48:43.460 --> 48:45.700\nAnd so she said, you know, you don't have to go\n\n48:46.820 --> 48:51.540\nUm, let's write letters to our representatives. Why don't you why don't you call?\n\n48:51.860 --> 48:54.900\nWe'll call our representatives and you can get on the phone and you can leave a message\n\n48:54.900 --> 48:56.900\nYou can read your letter and leave a message\n\n48:57.220 --> 49:01.700\nBut like kids are genuinely panicked and that's kind of one of the things that seeing that\n\n49:01.700 --> 49:03.700\nat the march\n\n49:03.940 --> 49:05.940\nLooking into their faces\n\n49:05.940 --> 49:11.140\nAnd seeing how seriously I mean I watched very young like four or five year old kids like\n\n49:11.620 --> 49:16.420\nWho seem to very much understand what was going on and have really real feelings about it\n\n49:16.500 --> 49:18.660\nSo there's all these accusations floating around\n\n49:19.300 --> 49:20.020\nlike\n\n49:20.020 --> 49:26.420\nOh, they couldn't possibly understand and they're too young to get it and they're just parenting their parents views or they're being manipulated or whatever\n\n49:26.420 --> 49:29.620\nBut like, you know what go to one of these marches and look at them and say it to their face\n\n49:29.620 --> 49:34.900\nBecause they seem to understand. Yeah, that's the thing that I wanted to interject with was I'm sure there's\n\n49:35.620 --> 49:40.340\nPlenty of cynical people who have plenty of like whatever you we've discussed this\n\n49:41.140 --> 49:43.140\ncomments on her photos and my\n\n49:43.140 --> 49:46.660\nPhotos of spencer holding a sign. There's there's a lot of hate\n\n49:47.060 --> 49:50.340\nBut here's the thing is like you look at the imagery like yeah\n\n49:50.340 --> 49:55.540\nI don't even want to it's like we'll look at the relationship between the parents and the children and the imagery\n\n49:55.700 --> 49:58.740\nLook at look at the mothers with the daughters on their shoulders\n\n49:58.740 --> 49:59.700\num\n\n49:59.700 --> 50:06.580\nAnd go ahead and start from the point of assumption that the little girl doesn't have any fucking idea what a gun is\n\n50:07.140 --> 50:10.820\nAnd understand how much more sad this becomes\n\n50:11.620 --> 50:14.100\nBecause it's a photograph of a relationship between\n\n50:14.660 --> 50:18.260\nA mother and daughter, but they do the kids are now having to learn\n\n50:18.820 --> 50:25.300\nLike the cold war where they had to do duck and cover drills because of um doomsday like nuclear warfare\n\n50:25.300 --> 50:33.860\nThey now have to go have quiet the quiet game the silent the silent game anybody anybody with that kind of critical voice of like of like\n\n50:34.020 --> 50:37.380\nLike oh the kids that they don't know how could you make this their problem?\n\n50:37.380 --> 50:42.900\nIt's just like we've definitely got to the point where that that argument is so fucking dumb\n\n50:43.460 --> 50:50.340\nBecause that's exactly everyone's argument like and that was the really effective like kind of somber mood\n\n50:50.420 --> 50:53.540\nI thought a lot of the signs and stuff was like the theme was\n\n50:53.540 --> 51:01.140\nWhether it was a parent that made a sign for a kid or the kid that made a sign for themself like the overwhelming theme was like\n\n51:02.900 --> 51:04.900\nI shouldn't have to be\n\n51:05.220 --> 51:09.700\nInvolved with us. I don't this shouldn't be it shouldn't have come to this\n\n51:09.940 --> 51:16.020\nI shouldn't be a voice in this conversation. We should we should have all been on the same page about me a long time ago\n\n51:16.660 --> 51:22.900\nI I think like yeah, etc. So there was one little girl in particular that make made me think that and I watched her for a while\n\n51:22.900 --> 51:28.260\nI have a bunch of pictures of her and a little bit of a video that I posted of her with her little friend too\n\n51:28.500 --> 51:30.500\nthat one's crazy and\n\n51:30.900 --> 51:37.060\nHer mother had a sign that just said save her and was pointing down because she knew her daughter would be at her feet most of the time\n\n51:37.780 --> 51:40.420\nWhich is what caught my eye and made me start watching this little girl\n\n51:40.740 --> 51:44.820\nThen her and her friend were like watching these older kids standing on a barricade\n\n51:45.860 --> 51:50.980\nAnd they were you know chanting like this is what democracy looks like and we call bs and all this\n\n51:50.980 --> 51:57.060\nAnd at one point these two little girls and one this one girl just had such a look of concern like she was looking around like\n\n51:57.700 --> 52:02.180\nIsn't this obvious? Yeah. Yeah, like look at all these people and they were chanting\n\n52:02.740 --> 52:09.220\nVote them out vote them out and she was staring at them and then at one point she just started\n\n52:09.860 --> 52:14.340\nVote them out. Yeah vote them out like she had like a realization of like yeah\n\n52:15.380 --> 52:19.620\nThat's what we do and yes vote them out. She was stomping her little feet\n\n52:19.620 --> 52:23.620\nAnd I just burst into tears and she looks like one of those photos\n\n52:23.700 --> 52:28.580\nI forget the photographer that took those great photos of the great depression of the little\n\n52:29.060 --> 52:33.860\nYeah, the kids the little girl covered and covered and like you know soots her dirt\n\n52:34.740 --> 52:38.180\nAnd the scared look on her face and she looked\n\n52:39.460 --> 52:46.260\nAbsolutely concerned. Yeah, like like scared miserable and she's like this isn't a drill\n\n52:46.260 --> 52:52.900\nThis isn't some actual shit and if people want to say oh the parents were brainwashing them. Fuck you\n\n52:52.980 --> 52:57.220\nYeah, but also just imagine like you're five you play the silent game\n\n52:57.300 --> 53:01.700\nIt's been explained to you what it's about you're going to go and you're going to hide and you're going to stay quiet\n\n53:02.020 --> 53:06.420\nFor as long as the drill and then you're going to get a little treat if you stay quiet the whole time\n\n53:06.740 --> 53:10.180\nAnd then going to the march and putting into context\n\n53:11.300 --> 53:15.620\nWhat is actually like this is the silent this is what the silent game is about\n\n53:15.620 --> 53:20.260\nThis is what everybody's yelling about. Yeah, and everyone's holding signs of pictures of rifles\n\n53:20.820 --> 53:22.820\nIt's sign that say no more silence\n\n53:23.300 --> 53:29.540\nStop gun violence.

I like gun control like I don't I don't like like like it's an awareness of gun control\n\n56:38.660 --> 56:43.140\nI think that you're kind of one of those liberal elites that thinks when you hear the name mc gun control\n\n56:43.380 --> 56:47.140\nYou think he wants to ban guns. Yeah, no, he wants to he's an anti-gun\n\n56:47.780 --> 56:53.140\nHe's he wants to open the debate about gun control, but it's very clear that he's in the pocket of the nra\n\n56:53.220 --> 56:59.540\nYeah, he wants to talk. I mean what trigger locks.

I thought it was all right an argument could be made that mc gun control\n\n57:14.580 --> 57:19.460\nIf it's true that all he wants to do is is rap about gun control awareness\n\n57:19.460 --> 57:23.940\nHe just wants to talk it was to open up the issue that then whatever you come into the whatever you experienced\n\n57:24.580 --> 57:26.100\nOnce you're aware\n\n57:26.100 --> 57:31.300\nThen we would hope I would think that the reason we want what we want is because more people want it so\n\n57:32.100 --> 57:33.460\nso\n\n57:33.460 --> 57:35.460\nLook, I was shocked about\n\n57:36.340 --> 57:38.900\nTo hear that he said he was paid by the\n\n57:39.140 --> 57:44.180\nWell, he I was simply asking the question and I didn't get a good answer.

I think\n\n57:52.260 --> 57:59.700\nThree three hundred seventy five thousand dollars per gig. He was trying to argue the point that he was only allowed to talk about certain bullet points\n\n58:00.740 --> 58:02.740\nYeah, I can't even look\n\n58:03.860 --> 58:06.020\nYeah, the elephant man is back on display\n\n58:06.580 --> 58:11.860\nUm, I'm sure this will make all the writers and the there are Mike in the chimney indie wire\n\n58:12.500 --> 58:15.140\nUh tomorrow look, I want to just\n\n58:16.260 --> 58:19.940\nIf I may speak since that seemed to be the attraction of the century\n\n58:19.940 --> 58:26.500\nUm, if I may if I may I assume that my voice is something you'd want to hear am I\n\n58:27.940 --> 58:31.540\nCorrect in that can we go back to the question that I asked you just get a simple guess or no\n\n58:32.420 --> 58:33.940\nokay\n\n58:33.940 --> 58:36.420\nDid you or did you not receive money from the nra?\n\n58:38.020 --> 58:40.020\nAt any point in the last year.

Here's the thing\n\n58:47.700 --> 58:49.700\nOkay\n\n58:50.020 --> 58:52.020\nThe foundation that pays me\n\n58:52.660 --> 58:56.260\nIs an awareness raising organization they have that they\n\n58:56.900 --> 59:02.900\nThat money came from the nra. Yes, it did not go to guns\n\n59:03.700 --> 59:09.620\nTo us the nra is an awareness organization. That's why they're tax exempt. Are you just talking about the nra again?\n\n59:09.940 --> 59:16.580\nYeah, I look you can play gotcha games. Like if you say anything enough, it'll sound real, but like\n\n59:16.580 --> 59:20.980\nI don't know that is it that is a fact the nra is tax exempt because they are raising awareness\n\n59:21.620 --> 59:28.020\nOkay, I mean I don't do taxes.

Wow. Wow. Everybody got uh\n\n01:10:55.140 --> 01:11:00.180\nJust up and yeah, it must have been real nice. It's been real nice. Have fun. I've been invited to one of those\n\n01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.260\nWow, how how is that?\n\n01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.340\nIt looks good. Looks fun. Yeah\n\n01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.900\nA lot of fun. You sent steve levy off to go. Yeah from the from the march for our lives\n\n01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:15.220\nYeah, steve levy had to go off and buy togas to a party that seemed pretty pretty fun pretty fun\n\n01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:18.660\nDino is there\n\n01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.500\nWow\n\n01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:28.900\nLike every weekend, I don't I was a guest at a toga party. So you didn't have fun. I had plenty of fun\n\n01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:35.460\nOkay, all right, this is guilty. I can't invite other people to uh, the friends of the voice in your head\n\n01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.300\nWe all like michael\n\n01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:42.260\nIt was his engagement party our friend michael waldrin who works at starburn's industry and you and you were like\n\n01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:46.420\nOh shab and and davidson and and aren't here. I guess okay\n\n01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:53.940\nDan probably just thought that we didn't support their engagement. So I don't think he that's probably why dan didn't invite us to michael's\n\n01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:56.580\nI don't think he gave it a second time. I just remembered. I did a thing\n\n01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.620\nHere's it. Here's a weird thing. I did at the part at michael waldrin's\n\n01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:03.780\nToga themed engagement party. He had a basket of\n\n01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:06.660\nOf blankets that were kind of like\n\n01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.820\nI think they're like\n\n01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:13.140\nLike leave behinds like like like like party favors like you it's a toga party. You might get cold\n\n01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.540\nWe're on a patio take this night. They got ordered\n\n01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:19.060\nThey got a bunch of blankets and I think you could like wrap it around your shoulder and then leave with it\n\n01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.140\nIt's kind of a kind of a thoughtful\n\n01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.220\nInteresting little artisanal idea\n\n01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.900\nI uh\n\n01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.900\nI started realizing\n\n01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:31.780\nAt some point I bet it's gonna get cold and I saw somebody wearing one of them and I here's what I did\n\n01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.380\nI went down to the basket\n\n01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:39.620\nBecause I was I was like i'm hot right now the sun's out, but it's gonna get cold later\n\n01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.860\nAnd these blankets are gonna be gone\n\n01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:48.260\nSo I took a blanket a free blanket that was like in a full basket like representing all this hospitality and I I\n\n01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:55.140\nLike I imagine I was like hunched over like a like a candy cane posture because I became just the stop motion villain\n\n01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.140\nI creeped off into the underbrush\n\n01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.660\nuh\n\n01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.660\nthe outskirts of their home and I\n\n01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.580\nUh, it the blanket is probably still there right now because I hid it\n\n01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:11.540\nI hid the blanket the way I hid uh the brown deer public library's only copy of slaughterhouse 5 because I had too many books\n\n01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.820\nAnd I couldn't get it so I hid it because no one else deserved it\n\n01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.180\nJesus christ\n\n01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:22.900\nSo you never wore the blanket? No, I never needed it. It was fine\n\n01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:27.540\nAnd there were plenty of blankets to go around you didn't go ahead retrieve it and put it back in the blanket\n\n01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:32.820\nIt wasn't the issue. You were too ashamed. Well, no, I never thought about it again. I'm a fucking sociopath\n\n01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:39.620\nDan I've known you for a long time. You've committed various crimes. That's that's your most egregious\n\n01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:44.020\nI didn't I'm not a sociopath because like whatever the uh, I felt like like it was the opposite problem\n\n01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.420\nA sociopath would be like well, maybe it'll get cold\n\n01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.060\nI guess I could mug one of these people for their blankets or whatever\n\n01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:56.500\nI was like never use it and never put it back. That's what a sociopath does. So you were there and you're like, oh\n\n01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:59.860\nI don't miss my friends\n\n01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:06.340\nIt's it's someone else's engagement party like what what do you guys want them to do invite every human\n\n01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:09.380\nLook, I'm not even I'll have you know, I was invited\n\n01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:14.020\nSo now talk to him. He threw this shit away at the end of the march\n\n01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:19.780\nCody was like, okay, so like I'll see you later, right? And I was like what and she's like waldren's thing\n\n01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.860\nAnd I was like what's thing and she was like\n\n01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.660\nHappens happens. I guess I wasn't\n\n01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:31.460\nAs soon as I was invited, but you know waldren probably better than I do the church because you work with him day in and day out\n\n01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:39.060\nDay in and day out every day. Michael waldren. Also, Michael waldren is probably one of the biggest\n\n01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.460\nDonators to the nra that works at starburns\n\n01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.460\nI think he bankrolled\n\n01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:50.900\nFollow the follow the money rob church follow the money on both sides. There are many sides to this issue\n\n01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:56.340\nFollow the money is such a funny goddamn phrase. I remember like follow the money\n\n01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:59.460\nSomebody uh, somebody pointed out that pat say jack\n\n01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:06.500\nWas uh that his his twitter account is just him in his twilight years kind of like he he was a big climate change denier\n\n01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:13.060\nAnd then he would he would use hashtag he would he would say stuff about climate change being full of shit\n\n01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:15.300\nAnd then he used the hashtag follow the money\n\n01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:19.300\nHe's supposed to follow the climate change non-denial money\n\n01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:25.860\nWhere does that money go? I mean, I guess we'll probably always work. He goes to pizza gate\n\n01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:28.580\nYou know where that money goes to buying more valves\n\n01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:30.820\nYeah\n\n01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:33.220\nGames at chuck willery. That's a hilarious joke\n\n01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:38.740\nThis is really good. See that's why that's why I missed the live audience because buying vows\n\n01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.060\nOh, it would have killed I\n\n01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.620\nBut don't you think it's nice that we got used to not needing an audience?\n\n01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:48.740\nI like that because it's like you just respect jokes for what they are regardless of the reaction they get\n\n01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:53.140\nOr not laugh at them. Yeah, I just go like it's like it's like it's like we're gonna\n\n01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.260\nWe're gonna go start doing shows. We're getting kicked out of here next\n\n01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:58.980\nWe're gonna start doing shows with an audience. Yeah, we haven't even mentioned that\n\n01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:04.580\nI'm doing it. I'm doing an all-live show at the Saban theater in Beverly Hills. It's all um\n\n01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:07.300\nSteven Tyler jokes\n\n01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:10.900\nGod dammit Jesus\n\n01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:17.140\nBy the way, the the week that you decided to take off is the week we had to do ads for the fucking boner pill\n\n01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:20.660\nBald people. Yeah that you talked us into doing what?\n\n01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:24.580\nYeah, I didn't talk. Oh, I please my god\n\n01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:29.700\nI said, oh my we could make it funny, but it wasn't like I was like well, we made it funny\n\n01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:34.260\nYeah, me and Dan made a real funny. Can we play it back? Do we have do we have the audio on that? No?\n\n01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:38.660\nI don't want you to yeah, but yeah, play it back. Let's take the time to find it and then\n\n01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.540\npipe it through the sound system\n\n01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:44.100\nFor the play it back for the no audience\n\n01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:47.860\nFor Jeff who hasn't heard it. Let's just take we're on a stage\n\n01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.340\n30 40 minutes at the top of this episode\n\n01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:54.180\nWe're we're on the stage with with lights, but with no audience. We're basically just\n\n01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:58.660\nDo it glorified. Let's do it calar brothers\n\n01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:02.660\nDo it\n\n01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:07.460\nWait, so you're saying that it's my fault that you guys did a bad boner pill ad or I'm not saying it's your fault\n\n01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.580\nI'm saying I'm saying I'm saying that that that come on\n\n01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:16.340\nYou know, that's ours. I'm saying it's ironic that what that the the night that you were like nah\n\n01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:21.860\nCan I not come in which up by the way the answer is always yes because really the alternative\n\n01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:26.660\nNo, I don't you don't no one no one really we have a choice. No one should be forced to be here\n\n01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.460\nDon't don't you don't you start to be here?\n\n01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:32.980\nYeah, I don't even know if you're asked to be here tonight\n\n01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:37.460\nI don't know if I was asked to be here. You were supposed to be here. So you're definitely not\n\n01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:41.780\nYou were actually asked to not be at the sheriff that I believe\n\n01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:46.980\nI'm not doing that. I believe that I believe\n\n01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:51.860\nYeah, do you know in prison they call hands dick beaters?\n\n01:17:55.860 --> 01:18:00.260\nIt's been how long an hour 20 minutes.

Let's bring our Steve Levy and maybe we'll say a sad farewell to church, everybody.\n\n01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:51.300\nDon't think it was listening to church. Think it was gaining a Levy.\n\n01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:56.020\nMy phone pronounces it Levy.\n\n01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:02.900\nYou had a good time at the toga party.\n\n01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:09.860\nI had a great time. I shut that place down and closed it down last night. You were like, go home.\n\n01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:14.980\nYeah, get out of here. Yeah. He doesn't like you guys anymore. Get the fuck out of here.\n\n01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:25.300\nSteve Levy is a caliber of performer capable of removing the human head at 50 yards. Now ask yourself.\n\n01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:35.700\nIs that a powerful gun? We think it is at the M.C. Gun Control Foundation.\n\n01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:39.140\nCan't pin him down.\n\n01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:50.740\nCan't pin him down. That's the formula. It's like it's Pat, but ideologically Steve Levy.\n\n01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:59.700\nSteve Levy. Yeah. Depending on your phone's preference. Steve Levy.\n\n01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.700\nHave you ever seen? What?\n\n01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:13.620\nSo anyway, I was walking to the grocery store and okay.\n\n01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:20.180\nAll right. Okay. It's been a thousand years. We might need a good proper five minute recap\n\n01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:27.780\nto bring us back up to speed. I think I need a soda. I don't know that we have soda. All right.\n\n01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:39.140\nOh, probably no music. I don't remember what happened. We were in Dornester and there was\n\n01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:43.300\nShrove and there was a dragon. They went into the theater and then they went to the basement and\n\n01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:53.300\nthey they were about to enter the theater. So they had just not given up and Diarrhea ran off\n\n01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:59.300\nand then you guys decided to look for him. You decided that the most obvious place to look for\n\n01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:06.100\nhim was in the theater and then you broke into the theater. You went into the kitchen. You went\n\n01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:13.300\nto the stage looking around. Oh, shit. There's soda. Someone get me a soda and then that one happened.\n\n01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:17.860\nI have written down. Oh, you start making poop noises. We were making fart sounds. I think we\n\n01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:22.660\nwere bursting in in a fight. I think we just kind of burst in the door. We're about to have their\n\n01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:31.220\nwell that's the end. But yeah. So we're in the theater trying to rescue DJ. Yeah. So DJ is tied\n\n01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:36.500\nup. Oh, thanks so much. DJ is tied up. Who else is tied up? Patchens is also tied up. And you\n\n01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:44.900\nguys just burst through the room. And yeah, you were you were you were going. It was about to\n\n01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:50.420\nbe the start of combat or something. Here we go. Yeah. Who are we looking at? I look. I examine\n\n01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:59.380\nmy surroundings. Hell yeah. That's the best thing anyone can do. Oh, fucking god damn it.\n\n01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:04.900\nSchrab. Schrab just spilled his kiss me. I'm Monday mug. You can get your\n\n01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:09.220\nso more kiss me on Monday mugs. Yeah, that's why I couldn't man. I couldn't if I tried.\n\n01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:18.420\nAll right. So you're in an under yeah, you're in an underground room. Shameless pretend\n\n01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:26.660\nmugs pill just to sell more of your wonderfully reasonably priced mugs, which we've already\n\n01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:33.460\nheard of selling well, not that you need more more sales. There was a point. You'll get them.\n\n01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:37.540\nThere was a point in our Harmontown team meeting where we were mad that you're selling more mugs\n\n01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:41.700\nand we don't have any merchandise. But Rob Schrab is cleaning up and that kissed me on Monday\n\n01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:48.420\nmug business. The other one is closing in. We know that was the other part of the call.\n\n01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:55.460\nHow's your free mug? Ask dick. Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly what it is. Good old Garry Shandling.\n\n01:24:55.460 --> 01:25:00.180\nHe sold a hundred of them. That's what I heard. He's cleaning up. What's the price point on one\n\n01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:05.940\nof your mugs, Rob? I don't know. I get like two bucks a mug. Two bucks a mug. That's almost\n\n01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:12.420\n$200. Yeah. I mean, we shouldn't be so quick to fill his coffers before worrying about our bottom line.\n\n01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:24.580\nYou can buy him on tpublic.com. Rob Schrab's store. I find him offensive and I don't think\n\n01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:31.540\nthey'll forward slash. I don't give a shit. Forward slash Weinstein. No, don't even. Don't\n\n01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:36.820\neven. Why you gotta do that? I'm just looking at. Why do you have to destroy? I'm looking at mine and\n\n01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:43.060\nI'm just trying to find out how to buy one of your one of your pro sexual harassment mugs. Stop it.\n\n01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:50.100\nLet's play D&D. Yes. Instead of shit. Rob's playing his character from Dead Ale Wives sketch.\n\n01:25:50.100 --> 01:26:00.660\nWhat? It makes sense to the right people. You're in an underground room. No. So you're in a low\n\n01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:08.260\nceiling to underground room, black wooden stained wooden boards. There's low like from candles that\n\n01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:14.900\nare on the walls. There's a table and a couple chairs. Yeah. Diarrhea is tied up against the wall\n\n01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.300\nand you see against the opposite wall. Patches is tied up. He seems knocked out. There's three\n\n01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:24.340\npeople who upon you bursting in the room just left to their feet and are scrambling for their\n\n01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:38.580\nweapons right now as we speak. Where am I? You are at home. I thought I came along. Well,\n\n01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:46.420\nthey left. They left the town. Yeah, I thought I came along. You can. I thought I did. Okay. Well,\n\n01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:52.900\nyou will arrive shortly. Okay. I will arrive shortly. Like in one turn or so, but you'll burst\n\n01:26:52.900 --> 01:27:00.820\nin because you'll be catching up. Okay. So how close is DJ? How close are DJ and Patchens to\n\n01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:06.820\neach other and how close to our foes here? DJ is 20 feet from you. Patchens is about 10 feet from\n\n01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:16.660\nyou. And the enemies? They're like halfway. They're closer. They're kind of in the middle.\n\n01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:25.060\nThey're humans? There's one orc. There's two humans in one orc. I turned to what's your name,\n\n01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:33.220\nCarlos? As a Carlos, why don't you open the bidding on this ass kicking? Gentlemen,\n\n01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:37.460\nI've been put in charge of opening the ass kicking.\n\n01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:49.940\nI'm going to cast Summon Monster 2. Yeah. Okay. And I've selected the monster that I'd like to\n\n01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:59.460\nsummon. All right. And its name is Goblin Dog. Sounds good. It's my favorite favorite. I'm gonna go\n\n01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:05.940\nGoblin some dog, man. Goblin dogs, no. There's a built-in like they're not gonna attack my friends.\n\n01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:09.140\nYour Summon monsters tend to, I think, attack enemies.\n\n01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:22.100\nIf you're just joining us, and I think that's how people watch information these days,\n\n01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:28.340\nthey flip through channels on their laptop. I've just summoned a Goblin dog. And it arrives\n\n01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:33.860\npresently. Whose name is what? Well, I didn't name him. Yeah, it comes from a different plane.\n\n01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:37.700\nHe's gonna be gone. I mean, I don't... I mean, it's a little... You don't want to get too close.\n\n01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:44.100\nRufus. The Goblin dog leaps into existence. It has the frame of like a Marmaduke kind of dog,\n\n01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:51.380\nbut it's the shape and fashion of more of our giant rat. So it's like... Greetings! Oh. Oh, no!\n\n01:28:51.380 --> 01:29:00.180\nOh, Rob's playing the guy. It does seem that way. I heard that I was summoned.\n\n01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:13.140\nHey, Goblin dog. Yes. Do you have a name? Rufus. Rufus. The Goblin dog.\n\n01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:22.980\nWell, why not cut the jibber-jabber and get to fighting? I'm going to cut some of this jibber\n\n01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:34.260\nand jabber. Let me put on my bib and my... pull out my knife and fork. And I'm going to go after\n\n01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:39.860\nthese baddies. Are you going to eat them, or do you use knife and fork as weapons?\n\n01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:46.580\nWhat knife and fork? I'm going to eat them. Okay. All right. What do you do when you put\n\n01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:50.980\non a bib and you pull out your knife and fork and lick your lips? I have limited Goblin dog\n\n01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:56.660\nexperience. I'm just... What the fuck are you doing? Sorry. Sorry. I am. You can do their\n\n01:29:56.660 --> 01:30:01.620\ntaxes with a fork and a knife? Dan is fidget spinning for the audience. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm\n\n01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:06.420\ngetting the light here. I better move. No, no, I'm just... No, that was a joke for Cody because I...\n\n01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:11.220\nDo you think she's watching? She's watching? No, she's probably... she's gotta be...\n\n01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:15.540\nShe's probably in love with someone else by now. Okay. Here I go. Attack.\n\n01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:23.220\nAttacking. How do you do it? Describe it. Well, what I'm good to do is I have my knife,\n\n01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:28.820\nwhich is very sharp, and my fork, which has got four prongs in it. And I'm good to just kind of\n\n01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:34.660\nstab and cut and chew and bite and, you know, in between I'll dab my chin with my bib.\n\n01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:42.420\nThat happens. You hit one of the guys as he's going for a weapon, and he takes five damage.\n\n01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:45.780\nYeah, that's right. The fork and knife. Can you describe the damage? Like,\n\n01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:52.340\nI want to know how this Goblin dog uses his fork and knife. Like you'd use a fork and knife. There's\n\n01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:58.020\nlittle slices and... What is the big conundrum here? It's a fork and a knife. You go, what are you\n\n01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:04.660\ngoing to do with that? Who is... is he with you? Could somebody explain? He doesn't have hands.\n\n01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:10.580\nHe's a dog. You don't know that. Steve, you're up next. I'm still tied up, right?\n\n01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:21.540\nYep, but you can spend an action. Oh. Chad, untie me. I go over and untie DJ.\n\n01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:26.820\nOh, that's great, because it's now your turn. Do you have dexterity? What's your dexterity?\n\n01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:34.100\nDo I have dexterity? He asks. I do. Dexterity is 16.\n\n01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:43.460\nYou're going to eat that, Mike, bro. Yeah, bro. 16. It doesn't... it doesn't work. It's... it's tied\n\n01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:47.780\nreally tight in the... in the thick of battle. You're telling me it's 16. You can't untie this.\n\n01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:52.980\nYou can't untie a rope? He's trying to avoid being hit and stuff, too. It's like your dodging attacks.\n\n01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:58.180\nAll right. Do I get... like, do I loosen it a little bit? Thanks for nothing. Oh, yeah, you loosen it\n\n01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:05.140\na lot. Okay, it's bad guy's turn. They finish scrambling to their weapons.\n\n01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:11.780\nYou can see one of them is like pulling on like a big robot puncher glove kind of thing,\n\n01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:16.660\nlike a big full body arm, and the other guy has something that looks kind of like a... like a hand\n\n01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:22.900\ngun. Just like a modern day handgun. And then the other guy grabs a sword and as he... and as he\n\n01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:30.340\nholds it aloft, it's like... and it becomes fire sword. Oh, shit. Geez. I love fire. And then they...\n\n01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:34.020\nthey form like a three-man formation that looks dynamic. You guys are going to bring a fire sword\n\n01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:42.180\nto chad the fire like or fight? Can you over... light his sword so that it's just burning his hand?\n\n01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:49.140\nKind of like it. Hang on. Do I have a spell that... I control fire, right?\n\n01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:53.380\nTo an extent. There's a spell you have control fire. I think it's dance turn, though.\n\n01:32:54.500 --> 01:33:00.340\nGentlemen, there's no need for a quarrel between the church of the silver flame and the dragon marked.\n\n01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:07.860\nI have to... you certainly seem to think you know what you're talking about, but\n\n01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:16.900\nnone of that means anything to me. Oh. Haha. What? It's, you know, like this is during combat.\n\n01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:24.340\nOh, right. Yeah. Well, I... I was mostly thinking that stuff. Oh, sorry. No, no. I mean, I thought\n\n01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:30.740\nI was gonna... I'm willing to... I did want to take a shot at like just communicating with them,\n\n01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:35.300\nand you're saying it didn't work. Yeah, they were the incorrect. So I kind of lose... I don't get to\n\n01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:39.940\nalso then go, in that case, I'll smash their brains in. Yeah, no, you get free... you get free talking.\n\n01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:48.260\nIs that like... host privilege? No, it's within reason. You can... you couldn't like read a book,\n\n01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:53.220\nbut you could like have a few... Because I'm like charging my spirit hands and going, gentlemen,\n\n01:33:53.220 --> 01:34:00.740\nyou really don't... okay. And now, here's the thing. Whoo-hoo! Boy, oh boy, I am gonna...\n\n01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:08.980\nI am going to cast Divine Favor on... No, you know what? Wait, wait, hold on a second. I want to see\n\n01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:12.980\nif there's anything I can do to get... Hey, room out! Let him talk. Well, I just want... I just...\n\n01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:16.580\nfor a second there, I was like, wait, I should be focusing on getting diarrhea free. I'm just saying,\n\n01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:22.500\nbecause they saw you kind of fishing. So I'm saying, let the man... I'm gonna cast...\n\n01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:40.660\nI'm gonna cast Divine Favor on Chad, which just gives him plus one for every three levels.\n\n01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:47.540\nYou've done it. You touch him with your magic finger, and it enhances him with God's might.\n\n01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:51.220\nI just thought, you're over there, you're doing great. Yeah. Just want to support.\n\n01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:59.540\nGoblin dog, signal boost. Okay, now it's my turn. I grab the nearest one by the leg and chew on it\n\n01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:06.260\nlike corn on the cob. The same one you attacked? Sorry, I didn't hear that. The closest. Okay,\n\n01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:11.860\nlet's say it's the same one. All right, you miss. You lunge it... I miss chewing on his leg. You\n\n01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:18.660\nlunge it his leg as if to chew. I miss it, so I'm doing this to the air that makes no sense. You find\n\n01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:24.820\nyourself chewing the leg of a table and or chair. Is it really dark? You can't tell because you're\n\n01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:31.860\ntoo close. Too close to the table leg. Or chair. Or chair to know if it's a chair. Have you ever\n\n01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:36.900\ntried to eat a guy's leg who didn't want his leg eaten? Yeah, I did last week. Were you there? No?\n\n01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:43.140\nOh, okay. Because you wouldn't know. Sorry. So you chewed it, you successfully chewed the last\n\n01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:48.820\nguys? How did you know that he didn't want his leg chewed? He said out. Spence, I want to use my\n\n01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:57.140\nknowledge of engineering to get myself out of these... Ropes. Do you have that as a skill?\n\n01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:05.460\nAre there ranks by it? It says total bonus six. Okay, you do it. Using your keen like Sherlock Holmes\n\n01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:12.980\nmovie vision, you see the holes in the knots and stuff and you are able to quickly shout\n\n01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:19.700\nthe instructions necessary to shout them? Well, if you wanted, you could tell Chad exactly how\n\n01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:30.740\nto do it since you can't you can't move, you know. Chad, you got to stick your thing in the loop\n\n01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:37.380\nhere and then pull real hard and then go underneath me and then lift me up on your shoulders and then\n\n01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:45.540\ndrop me real fast and then pull the biggest loop real hard. Like a yo-yo. I do that. All right,\n\n01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:51.540\nhe flips around like a yo-yo and is very quickly on his feet and untied, although you don't have\n\n01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:58.340\nyour stuff with you. I don't have my stuff. No, you can take some sort of action now because that\n\n01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:04.900\nwas... Can I use charge to get my stuff? You don't know where your stuff is. Oh, I don't know where\n\n01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:09.380\nit is. Not off hand. You kind of just regain consciousness recently. All right. Well, I want\n\n01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:15.540\nto be a distraction, so I'm just going to run in circles yelling, eat my ass bastards and try to\n\n01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:22.500\nmake them really confused. I'm not telling you not to do that, but you love that idea. Before you do\n\n01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:28.020\nthat, you get the sense that doing that will open you up to between three and seven attacks\n\n01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:36.740\nby realizing the rules of the game. That's how you know this stuff. But those would all be people\n\n01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:43.220\nwho would otherwise attack us. Yeah, that's the thinking. But no, they're free attacks, so you'd\n\n01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:53.380\nbe taking free damage. Three? Free. It wouldn't profit me at all if you did that. You can try and\n\n01:37:53.380 --> 01:38:00.580\nbe distracting, but running near them in a circle, I think, is the most dangerous way to be distracting.\n\n01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:07.860\nOkay, well, then I look around the room while I yell, eat my ass bastards. Okay, so you're just\n\n01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:14.740\ntrying to be distracting without suicide. It's not very distracting. They quickly clock that\n\n01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:24.500\nyou're unarmed and just trying to be distracting. Yeah, I'm sorry. I need better dice. So did I die?\n\n01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:31.060\nNo, but your distraction is not distracting. Oh, do I see where my stuff is? No, you're just\n\n01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:36.100\nrunning around being distracting. Okay, that's fine. That's a success in my mind.\n\n01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:47.620\nI can I cast a level one and a level two or just like just one two different turns. Yeah,\n\n01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:56.420\ntwo different. Okay, tree shape, I turned into a tree. But there's a lead up to this,\n\n01:38:56.420 --> 01:39:01.220\nthat there's going to be something else that happens. I just I become a tree that gives me\n\n01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:07.220\nplus 10 to my armor class. Oh, yeah. I'm a tree now. Are we like, we're in the middle of a room?\n\n01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:13.460\nOkay, I'm now a fucking tree in the middle of the room. And I kind of like, do I have facial\n\n01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:20.580\nfeatures or am I just a full on tree? You have two things that might look kind of like eyes. Okay,\n\n01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:27.140\nI take one limb and kind of like give my team a thumb like this is going to pay off. Yeah,\n\n01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:32.900\nbut right now, I'm thinking on the fact that me turning into a tree in the middle of a combat\n\n01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:37.700\nis going to fucking freak them out and put them off, like put them on their back heel for a moment.\n\n01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:42.980\nYou bank on that. Yes, you're a beautiful tree. Thank you. A shambling mount appears.\n\n01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:55.140\nHow are you doing? Just coming through me and Gary. That's me too. I'm walking through the\n\n01:39:55.140 --> 01:40:03.620\nbuilding and I'm seeing a tree and you and he and we're going to be friends forever. I'm here.\n\n01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:08.980\nWhat's going on, guys? The tide of the battle is turning.\n\n01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:14.100\nI thought I just honked. You fucking nailed that.\n\n01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:22.740\nYeah, I'm a tree. I'm a tree. How are you doing? Play it cool, Gary. Hello. How are you doing?\n\n01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:33.220\nPlay it cool. Dog creature. Well, I was summoned to help out here. Really? I gave you plus one\n\n01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:40.660\non all of your defense and offense and you turned into a tree. I have another spell.\n\n01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:47.300\nJust do it. Get through another round and just watch. What? Somebody explain to me what's been\n\n01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:53.780\ngoing on since I showed up before. I turned myself into a tree. Talk without moving your limbs.\n\n01:40:53.780 --> 01:41:00.500\nTalk without moving enough speech to take a turn. What? This is a lot of speech. Right?\n\n01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:04.580\nWe're in combat, so if you keep talking, then I'm not going to have... Well, I need to know\n\n01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:09.780\nwhat's going on. Well, you can see that with your sensory. I can see what happened before I showed up.\n\n01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:12.980\nNo, what currently is happening. But I don't know what's going on.\n\n01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:16.980\nNo, you can see what's going on. No, I'm telling you, you can see what's going on.\n\n01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:22.100\nBefore I came here, I could see what's going on. No, you're currently here and you can currently\n\n01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:26.500\nsee currently what's going on. There's a fight going on. What's going on? I'm a tree and there's\n\n01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:30.980\na fight. Get the guys that you don't know. Hit the people that you don't know who they are.\n\n01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:35.700\nOkay, I grab the guy who's got the flaming sword and I grab him by the wrist and I shake it.\n\n01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:43.780\nAnd I go, what are you doing? Put that down. Put it down. What are you doing? All right.\n\n01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:51.620\nWhat are you doing with that? Put it down. No, put it down. What are you doing? What are you doing\n\n01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:57.380\nwith that? Come on. What are you doing with that? We're doing a flaming sword. Put it down.\n\n01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:02.820\nAll right, you do that. You lunge at him and he slashes you with his flaming sword. It deals 18\n\n01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:09.860\ndamage. Even after I was saying all of that? No, but then you grab him and then you grab him\n\n01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:15.460\nwith your massive shambling arnhem and you crush his wrist. So now you're holding him by the wrist\n\n01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:21.060\nand you got him by his sword hand, but in that process you took damage. How much health does\n\n01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:27.300\nshambling have? Well, that doesn't sound good. No, no, you have a lot. That's what I was laughing\n\n01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:32.500\nabout. But did you tell him that I'm saying all this stuff, that I'm shaking his hand and I'm saying,\n\n01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:36.100\ntell him that I'm saying... Oh, I told him. Put it down. What are you doing? No, I told him.\n\n01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:40.900\nWhat are you doing? You slashing me? What if I did that to you? You wouldn't like it. All right.\n\n01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:44.500\nWouldn't like it. Keep acting like this. I'm going to take your pants down from all these people.\n\n01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:48.980\nWhose turn is it? No, it's my turn. I'm going to give you a lickin'. All right. One of the guys,\n\n01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:54.180\nhe identifies the shambling mound as the biggest threat and... Hey!\n\n01:42:54.180 --> 01:43:02.020\nHey! I get known. I'm known here. This guy's the puncher guy. He's the orc.\n\n01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:13.300\nHe tries to punch at you. He charges up his punch, right? And it's like this big robot device.\n\n01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:18.260\nAnd you can see it's all like warring and steaming and piston-ing and it just explodes.\n\n01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:24.580\nOh. His fist explodes. Yeah, it just explodes. Like a misfire? Yeah. So that was a critical\n\n01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:29.220\nfail on a robot punch? Yeah, it blows him in half. Do he died? Yeah. Hell yeah.\n\n01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:34.340\nThrough no fault of your own. You scared him to explosion.\n\n01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:43.460\nYou see that? You see what happens? You see what happens? Drop it. All right. Put it down. The other\n\n01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:48.900\nguy shoots... He points the gun at you guys and shoots it and it fires like... It looks like a\n\n01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:54.180\nlightning bolt. If someone just casts lightning bolt and it just blasts through the room. It cuts\n\n01:43:54.180 --> 01:44:00.580\nthrough the room. It hits all four of you guys. What caliber is that? What caliber is that?\n\n01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:06.820\nFor how much damage it spends? 4d6. No, 3d6. We all get hit? Yeah, you all get hit. I deduct.\n\n01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:13.540\nYep. I can't remember my hit points.\n\n01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:20.980\nLook at your sheet. Well, I'm looking at it, but I can't remember how much damage I have had.\n\n01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:28.020\nWe all had healed before. It's not true. It's not true. Remember, I'm a tree right now with\n\n01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:33.460\nplus 10 to my armor class. Oh, right. And trees actually have lightning resistance. Yeah. I don't\n\n01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:38.420\nknow if that's true. The shambling mound has got lightning resistance. That might be true.\n\n01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:42.500\nYou guys are going to... You guys are going to be so proud of me when you find out why I turned\n\n01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:47.460\nmyself into a tree. It better be a good pun at the end of this. It's not going to be a pun. I mean,\n\n01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:52.500\nhonestly, I don't... I don't remember you having 14, but I could be wrong. Okay. I'll go with that.\n\n01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:58.500\nSounds right. So, I now have... Five. Five. If I'm right. Yeah. Wait, we took 11 damage? No, he took\n\n01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:06.260\nnine damage. You took 13 damage. Wow. You got hit harder. I didn't get any. I didn't take any damage.\n\n01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:11.380\nNo, I got to see if you're resistant. Because I'm shambling. I shamble out of the way of the lightning.\n\n01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:19.620\nOh, yeah. Yeah. You're immune to electricity. See? Yeah. And that's why you turn yourself into a tree.\n\n01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:29.140\nAnd he is... I'm a swamp thing, motherfucker. Motherfucker. I'm like swamp thing. I'm immune to electricity,\n\n01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:36.100\nmotherfucker. Motherfucker. Motherfucker. I'm immune. Carlos, do you have a group healing spell?\n\n01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:42.580\nDo you have... If you have channel energy, you do. I have channel energy. Tune into channel energy.\n\n01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:45.860\nIt wasn't what I was going to do next. You don't have to. And I don't even know.\n\n01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:52.260\nWell, I mean, I think I'm close to death here. Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone within 30 feet\n\n01:45:52.260 --> 01:46:03.620\ngets a 2D6 heal if I channel energy. Hey, no harm. All right. So, Dan, you get back five,\n\n01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:06.980\nand you two get back six. But you haven't taken damage, right? No, because I'm a tree. Right.\n\n01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:12.260\nYeah. But I took damage before, man. Can I get some of that healing? You get six. I get healed.\n\n01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:16.340\nSix. I get six healed. Yeah. So you keep it track of this because I don't have a pencil.\n\n01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:22.740\nYou're at 10 now. Somebody... I'm not. You're not keeping track of it? No. I mean, I'm loosely\n\n01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:28.100\nkeeping track of it. Okay. Well, I'm loosely... How much HP does Chamling have overall? He's taken\n\n01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:32.580\n12 damage at this point. But what's his total? What was his total? You don't know. How much am I giving?\n\n01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:39.620\nOkay. Sorry. You go. Oh, no. Oh. What were you saying? Well, no, I cast the\n\n01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:43.220\nChat Channel's Energy. Okay. It's Goblin Dog's last turn. Do you want to have him do anything?\n\n01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:49.780\nYes. Give me something to do. Well, just attack... You could attack me? What did I do?\n\n01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:56.900\nIt's his last attack before he goes away. Well, and Diarrhea Jr. has been freed of his tethers?\n\n01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:02.660\nYeah. Okay. And yeah, these aren't complicated creatures. They're summoned, and they attack,\n\n01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:08.500\nand they don't attack. So, yeah, I have them attack the... Can I change that to the weakest\n\n01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:13.780\nlooking guy? Yeah. Which is... Which is what... Which one is it? Which is the weakest?\n\n01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:18.740\nWell, I... Which is the weakest one? Doesn't your Goblin Dog instinct...\n\n01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:21.220\nKind of... Aren't you able to kind of sense weakness?\n\n01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:30.660\nSure. Oh, that's your choice then. Okay. I attack the guy with the lightning gun,\n\n01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:34.740\nand I go up and I just... I just kind of chew on his face.\n\n01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:40.740\nAll right. Chew on his face a little. Do you want to roll? You chew it. I did already.\n\n01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:44.980\nAnd? Five damage. You bite him right on the face. You rip open his lip.\n\n01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:50.580\nIt's gross. Good job, Goblin Dog. Good job, Goblin Dog. That was...\n\n01:47:50.580 --> 01:48:00.660\nYoung girls. Wait, Goblin Dog. Yes? Your name was... Rufus. Yep. Thumbs up.\n\n01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:07.620\nGoing back to hell. He disappears. He returns to hell.\n\n01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:13.860\nI really liked him. I liked that guy. All right, Steve's turn.\n\n01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:20.180\nI'm still a tree, right? Yeah. As far as I understand. Yes, sir.\n\n01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:23.860\nDo any of you guys have a weapon that I could borrow for this attack?\n\n01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:29.940\nCan a tree hand him a weapon? No. Your stuff is a tree. I'm a tree.\n\n01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:35.300\nYeah, you would have been able to. Can I rip a branch off of... No. Yeah, you can.\n\n01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:41.460\nI could give you something. What do you got? I didn't...\n\n01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:48.740\nSorry. I didn't describe this this time. I described it last time, but I forgot to...\n\n01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:55.060\nYeah. There's a target. It's like a throwing knife target on the wall that's full of throwing\n\n01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:04.740\nknives. Oh, that's... I mean... Okay, great. Can I dart to the target? You're already near it.\n\n01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:11.780\nOh, can I pull out... Careful. Three throwing knives? Are they heavy? Yeah, they're really light.\n\n01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:22.740\nOkay, so I'll pull out a couple of those, and I want to throw them at the fire sword's chest.\n\n01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:27.940\nOkay. His hand is being grabbed, so he can't dodge as well.\n\n01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:35.700\nYeah. But you're not proficient. What's your dexterity? Oh, God. It's 15 plus two.\n\n01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:44.420\nYeah. No, you miss. It whizzes by his head. Hey, what are you doing? I'm sorry. I thought...\n\n01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:49.780\nI'd be able to hit him while you were holding him still. It's Jeff's turn. Entangle!\n\n01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:58.900\nThat was a big thing. Can I be my own entanglement device now that I'm a tree?\n\n01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:06.100\nI'm going to look it up, but let's just say yes for now. Because I now can use woodland the branches\n\n01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:14.740\nand vines to entangle plants, everyone in 40-foot radius. All right. I'm just trying to entangle them.\n\n01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:18.740\nSo do we get entangled also? No, no, I'm aiming at the bad guys. That's the thing,\n\n01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:23.140\nis I feel like I'm going to have to look this up, because I think you might entangle anyone.\n\n01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:26.980\nJust follow your heart, follow your heart. I'm going to just say for now that it's just fine.\n\n01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:31.540\nOkay. But I think everyone technically might be entangled. But let's not worry. Everyone?\n\n01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:37.460\nOkay. Well, okay. If I find Tangle, everybody. So it's willy-nilly? I have no control over who I\n\n01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:41.700\nentangle? Well, it's area-based, and we're in a small confine. But I don't know. Let's just say...\n\n01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:46.260\nI had big plans. I know. Let's just say for now, because I'm not sure, and I don't want to look it\n\n01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:52.340\nup. Let's just say you... Fuck it. I entangle everybody, because we can talk it out. Yeah.\n\n01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:58.820\nWe can talk this shit out. I want to be in that wrong... I entangle everything in a 40-foot\n\n01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:05.780\nradius, and I'm just a big entangler. Right. But it's not like chains or anything. It just\n\n01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:10.660\nmakes it harder. It's like fighting through a maze. Okay. So I haven't changed anything. Well,\n\n01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:15.940\nyou have. Yeah. They're definitely currently bound. They're just not... I was going to just\n\n01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:22.020\ntangle if fuckers happen. Well, what happens? There's a fire sword in the mix. Well, it's being held.\n\n01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:33.540\nYeah. Oh. I got it taken care of. Yeah. Fuck it. I knew it this. I'm a druid that hasn't really\n\n01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:37.860\nfigured this shit out. I just started entangling. Fuckers, now everyone's caught in my web of\n\n01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:47.620\nentanglement. Yep. And I hold his flaming sword up high away from the tangles, so they don't catch\n\n01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:53.060\nfire. Right. Yeah. Because they don't catch fire if it's held up high. That works. Yeah. And I'm\n\n01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:57.940\nstill shaking it, and I'm telling him to... What is he doing? What are you doing? Don't do that.\n\n01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:03.380\nThank you, Garry Shandling. You're welcome, Chad. Is that your whole turn? Do you want to do other\n\n01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:16.340\nstuff? Is it my turn? Yeah. I start kicking him. Kicking him in his shins. All right. I go and...\n\n01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:24.660\nYou big man? You a big man now? You a big man? Does he answer? Does he ever say anything? How's\n\n01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:33.620\nPatchen's doing? Patchen's is unconscious. Does he say... He's probably entangled. He says ow. Yeah. You\n\n01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:39.540\nhit him for 16 damage. Oh, shit. What? You kicked the fuck out of his shins. Yeah. I'm kicking him\n\n01:52:39.540 --> 01:52:44.900\nin his shin and ass. Yeah. And I go, you stupid mother... That hurts more than the lightning?\n\n01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:54.660\nI don't know. Wow. You break his knees. Whoa. Yeah. You don't want to get a Shambling kick.\n\n01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:57.700\nWho's that? It's like Edward Norton in American History X.\n\n01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:06.740\nSo the guy with broken knees tries to break free, and he does. He falls to the ground just trying\n\n01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:18.260\nto slice with his flaming sword, and he hits the tree, and so he's going to catch it on fire.\n\n01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:27.220\nOh, come on. I love fire. Oh. I hope you love being on it. My name is the Fire Liker.\n\n01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:35.940\nAll right. You take 13 fire damage. Bullshit. All right. He does that. The other guy,\n\n01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:41.460\nhe's got the Zapcaster... Well, you don't know that's what it's called. That's really its name,\n\n01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:46.660\nZapcaster. It's a working title, but yeah. Most of the stuff is behind the scenes terminology,\n\n01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:52.820\nbecause it doesn't come up. But yeah, he can't pull himself free from the entanglement to shoot\n\n01:53:52.820 --> 01:54:01.540\nanybody with his gun. Yeah. Because I'm a tree. Is fire damage over time? Yeah. Well, it'll keep\n\n01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:06.740\nburning. Yeah, it keeps burning unless it's put out. So now it's Dan's turn. So one person's dead.\n\n01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:11.300\nOne person is very crippled and on the floor. They only kind of managed to catch something on\n\n01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:16.260\nfire while they were falling out of the grass boom monster. And then the guy, the other guy's\n\n01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:28.100\nentangled. Oh. You're entangled, kind of. Okay. Well, is there anyone within attack range of\n\n01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:34.740\nmelee-wise? Uh, no. You've been kind of out of the fray, I think. All right. Well, then I'm just\n\n01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:46.260\ngonna do a good old solar flare blinding everyone in the room. Can you do that more than once a day?\n\n01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:52.420\nDid I already do it today? You did it once today. Yeah. Because I did it in the bathroom? Yeah,\n\n01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:58.500\nthat was the same day. I mean, I said I was doing a solar flare. It was the expression of how the\n\n01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:02.740\ntacos were hitting me. You might be able to do more than once per day. I'm not sure. No, it says\n\n01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:09.620\nonce per day. No, it doesn't say that, but it doesn't say more than once. Okay. Well, try this\n\n01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:16.740\non for size. How do you like this? Here's something I can do more than once a day.\n\n01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:24.740\nZip. Yeah. Channel energy and heal everybody within 30 feet. That's what I do. I'm a healer.\n\n01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:34.580\nIt's not a good ending, but... Do I grow bigger? No, but you heal. I'm already healed. You heal three.\n\n01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:42.900\nSteve heals six. Jeff heals four. Dan heals six. I'm not writing this down. It's fine. Steve's writing\n\n01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:50.740\nit down. Or if he's not, it's fine. No, I'm writing it down. Yeah, so everyone is healed for that\n\n01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:56.180\namount. We got this one guy that's crippled. People are still untangled. How many rounds are they\n\n01:55:56.180 --> 01:56:06.500\nuntangled for? At least two more. Steve. I mean, can I move at all? What's my...\n\n01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:15.220\nYou're being entangled, so you can try to move, but you might fail. Okay. Is it sort of... Would you\n\n01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:24.180\nsay like all the vines and stuff were sort of like its own dungeon? Sure. Could I use my knowledge\n\n01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:33.780\nof dungeoneering and maneuver through the... Oh, Steve. Wow. You can try. It's not a word game.\n\n01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:40.020\nIt's a game of the imagination. You don't gain meaningful insight from the vines.\n\n01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:45.300\nBecause they're not a dungeon at all. Or because you can't connect them to a dungeon.\n\n01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:49.780\nMaybe there's a dungeon... Because they're... They're vines. Well, maybe there's like a\n\n01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:54.100\ndungeon of the vines, but he's just never been there to connect... A dungeon of the vines.\n\n01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:59.860\nThere is one. I'm saying it now. The bad guy is like, have you guys heard of the dungeon of the\n\n01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:06.980\nvines? Oh my god. Oh, damn. Wow. So is my turn over? Can I... No, you just don't know. You...\n\n01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:15.460\nAll right. So then I do my best to get to the closest enemy and try to... And I'll just keep\n\n01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:22.260\nway on punching them if I make it. Okay. You do that. Hell yeah. So you're punching... Which guy?\n\n01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:26.340\nWhoever's closest. Who's the guy? The... Yeah, the crippled guy's closest. I'm just gonna...\n\n01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:31.940\nYeah. Just keep punching him while he's down until his face is all bloody and like his bones\n\n01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:38.260\nstart cracking. What's your strength bonus? 18 plus four. That's a lot of... You hit him for five\n\n01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:43.220\ndamage. Fuck yeah. All right. You knock him out. Eat my shit, you bitch.\n\n01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:53.060\nEat my shit. You... That could be. Yeah. Moment pass. Who's turn? Jeff's turn. Can I... Can I\n\n01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:57.940\ndo a firebolt as a tree or am I just a tree? No, you gotta come back from a tree to not entangle.\n\n01:57:58.660 --> 01:58:05.540\nIs that one turn? Let's see. You can do it as a free action. Okay. Free action. I untree.\n\n01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:12.740\nAnd I shoot firebolt at crippled guy. Okay. Wait. He just got knocked out. Oh yeah. Fuck\n\n01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:22.180\nhim. I'm gonna kill him. Okay. You missed. Jesus Christ. It's all right guys. I've been a tree for the last 10 minutes.\n\n01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:30.820\nYeah. Shambling mount. I... I run up to the crippled guy that's unconscious. I start stomping on him\n\n01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:39.060\nlike De Niro and Goodfellas. Okay. When he's stomping on the the shinebox guy. So the camera's\n\n01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:46.820\nlike looking up at you. Up at me and I'm going. It's gross. It makes you uncomfortable. It makes\n\n01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:51.300\na lot of people make that mistake. That character's name isn't the shinebox guy. He's dead.\n\n01:58:56.980 --> 01:59:00.020\nHe's dead. Gary, you killed him.\n\n01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:14.580\nThank you Lord Jesus. Thank you. Thank you Jesus Christ in heaven. Thank you. Thank you Saint Peter.\n\n01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:21.220\nWho are these people he's talking about? Thank you Jesus. I don't know. What was that?\n\n01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:32.580\nClefanger. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. The most fitting ending to an episode ever.\n\n01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:37.620\nGive it up for Steve. Leave it everybody. The best episode. The most fitting ending.\n\n01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:49.300\nIt's a trap. Man. This ended an episode in silence. Yeah. Not even mid like. The credits weren't\n\n01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:57.220\neven rolling. It was just kind of like. Should we cut? Should we cut? Okay. Let's give it up for\n\n01:59:57.220 --> 02:00:03.300\neverybody that helps make this awesome. You sang Sarah, Kevin, Chris, Zach, Church.\n\n02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:08.260\nTim Morge is here somewhere. Wasn't Tim Morge supposed to be on the show? Is he just hanging\n\n02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:16.900\nup? Have I forgotten anybody? Oh, especially Quinten in the Game Master. I'm the Comptroller,\n\n02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:26.900\nMr. Jeff Davis, your mayor is Dan Harmon. Try fast. Take chances.\n\n02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:44.900\nDid you get any of that? It's a good show.\n","cpu_time":["0.002s"],"str_size":[140699]}
