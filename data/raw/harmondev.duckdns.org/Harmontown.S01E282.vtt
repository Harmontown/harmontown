WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I

00:06.400 --> 00:08.400
Spencer do you hear what I hear

00:10.200 --> 00:12.200
No

00:12.240 --> 00:14.240
Said this

00:21.960 --> 00:23.960
I think

00:23.960 --> 00:29.440
It's the beginning of spring, but I think I hear sleigh bells and the pitter-patter of reindeer

00:31.480 --> 00:39.440
Yes, slow down reindeer Santa Claus. I I just came up through the chimney because I heard you Jesus Christ

00:40.360 --> 00:46.360
What the shit? I'm supposed to go down that I'm behind you. I can see damn it

00:46.360 --> 00:49.600
I could say the same thing to you. What the fuck are you doing on my river?

00:49.600 --> 00:53.520
Oh, it's almost April. Are you Jeffy Davis? I

00:54.680 --> 00:56.680
Jeff be Davis but close enough

00:57.440 --> 00:59.920
Well, you're on my nice list

01:00.920 --> 01:05.400
Plus one who's is that Spencer Spencer L. Clinton?

01:06.120 --> 01:10.720
Yeah, he can be your plus one because why

01:11.480 --> 01:13.480
Can I can I get out front of this?

01:13.480 --> 01:21.280
Well, that would embarrass me. Well, look, let me take it at least across the threshold. Okay, so I don't look like an invalid

01:21.280 --> 01:26.280
All right, I looks Santa Claus. I enjoyed your choo-choo and your leg goes so you

01:27.720 --> 01:34.920
I'll tell you what though and you can you can the after I initiate it you can come in anytime you want I

01:34.920 --> 01:43.040
Have come back around to my nicest boys with me undies

01:43.040 --> 01:54.040
Wait, are you just here doing a cheesy podcast advert? It's Harmontown's first historic and I believe the podcast industry's first live

01:55.440 --> 02:02.480
Pre-roll ad read some people said this is a bad idea. No, I by the way, this wasn't the client's idea

02:02.480 --> 02:06.240
But it was my idea as an entertainer

02:06.680 --> 02:12.640
Well, it'd be cool. Okay. Well, look, look, it's cold out. It's April. It's still chilly

02:13.640 --> 02:16.720
Christmas, but since I'm up here without any underwear on oh

02:17.240 --> 02:19.240
Sweater alert. I'm naked. I'm a child

02:20.360 --> 02:22.240
What?

02:22.240 --> 02:24.240
What do you got for me, Santa? Oh?

02:24.680 --> 02:26.280

02:26.280 --> 02:34.320

Har

04:19.040 --> 04:21.760
Santa Santa you you you're overthinking it

04:23.440 --> 04:28.560
You had a good one. You're right. All you have to do is just go on dash or on on on on Rudolph

04:28.840 --> 04:33.280
You can just go away. All right, or so or Santa just read the call to action on this copy

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Go to what?

04:36.000 --> 04:44.960
Action Santa Claus. He already did. I did. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm drunk. I'm four and I'm naked. I'm sober. Yeah, I'm sober

04:45.080 --> 04:52.800
Yeah, it's April and Santa's here. He's sober. Shouldn't you be making toys instead of peddling children underwear in the middle of the night?

04:52.800 --> 04:57.240
All right, let's start the show. Hey everybody welcome to Uptown Burbank

04:58.240 --> 05:01.960
Harmontown is now in the session

05:01.960 --> 05:06.040
And Zack you got a beat for me. No, what the fuck is that?

05:06.040 --> 05:08.760
I just a zackist a zackist

05:09.560 --> 05:11.560
Now yeah

05:11.960 --> 05:16.560
This is a good format. That was exhilarating. We do it cold open. It might not go ahead. Go ahead

05:16.560 --> 05:21.360
No, I will have different cold open. Sometimes we'll just see plot threats, but we'll have them

05:21.360 --> 05:24.960
I think that what we just did was

05:25.760 --> 05:27.760
advertising history. Oh

05:27.760 --> 05:34.240
By the way, I'm Jeff Davis your Comptroller. We're in Burbank Harmontown is now in session. Let's welcome Spencer Crittenden your game master

05:34.440 --> 05:38.480
You might recognize him from the recent Santa Claus me and he's that

05:39.400 --> 05:45.040
Also the star of Santa Claus and playing the role of Santa L. Claus

05:45.720 --> 05:48.120
The mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon

05:48.760 --> 05:54.000
Thank you. See it's already a better format because it didn't make I know and I knew it was never

05:54.000 --> 05:58.080
It was never supposed to make sense what we were doing because we're performing for nobody

05:58.080 --> 06:02.760
My thought was just do it, but make a little I like making a little tweak like that

06:03.200 --> 06:09.280
We can do a cold open. I can already be sitting up here and then and then and then the music can play

06:09.280 --> 06:13.360
It's a cold open. It feels professional and it's not really professional

06:15.160 --> 06:17.160
With a capital P

06:17.880 --> 06:20.120
If Harmontown can

06:20.120 --> 06:24.920
Guarantee one thing is professionalism of our pre-roll

06:24.920 --> 06:31.600
But you know, I also think it would be funny. Remember when we were remember on Oscar night and we were like I

06:32.840 --> 06:35.200
Was like I got really excited for a second because

06:35.680 --> 06:41.960
We're clearly the Oscars weren't even over much less had we seen them much less had we planned then I riffed the dumb

06:42.160 --> 06:48.360
Sarcastic thing of like yeah, we've been rehearsing the show all month, but like we should just we should force ourselves

06:48.360 --> 06:51.280
Before each show we should decide

06:52.040 --> 06:56.240
Or we could do it on stage, but there should always be a fake

06:57.480 --> 07:04.560
Like a there's it has to be a fake segment. There has to be a sketch. Yeah, all right. No, maybe not an opening

07:04.560 --> 07:07.280
But we'll just get in that or like SNL

07:07.280 --> 07:11.200
We have to come out and do our our Sarah Huckabee Sanders

07:11.200 --> 07:16.760
Yeah, it's like it's coming. It's gonna it's happening tonight and we we refer to it or whatever. I don't know are you

07:16.760 --> 07:21.200
Are you suggesting we like just like think about the show at all?

07:22.000 --> 07:27.200
Just a little bit just that much that just enough to make it like willfully shittier

07:27.200 --> 07:32.240
Which would make it better because it would be structurally no idea like like we'd enjoy that they'd enjoy that

07:32.800 --> 07:35.800
Yeah, no, I think they'd enjoy more effort on our part

07:35.800 --> 07:43.840
Yeah, especially the people that paid for it

07:49.640 --> 07:51.640
No, I'm excited

07:52.760 --> 07:58.560
We got here an hour early to talk about business affairs right and so we were here early and

07:58.800 --> 08:03.680
We were kind of already warmed up. Yeah as opposed to just rolling in right at eight o'clock. Yeah

08:03.680 --> 08:12.880
Yeah, your voice is warmed up. Nothing like talking about the podcast business to bring the spirit from your solar plexus up in dear joy chakra

08:14.880 --> 08:18.040
Because we all do this to have a good time, but that that's actually true. I

08:19.800 --> 08:21.800
Had an epiphany in therapy

08:22.600 --> 08:27.000
And my therapist gave me a fist bump which she she doesn't usually

08:27.640 --> 08:30.800
You know touch me and stuff and she she also kicked my foot

08:30.800 --> 08:36.200
Like like as she was getting up to schedule next week's appointment. She like kicked my foot like it's you

08:37.520 --> 08:40.000
She called me. She said I was transcend

08:40.720 --> 08:42.640
trans

08:42.640 --> 08:44.640
Transforming no

08:46.480 --> 08:50.960
So I'm just trying to I've I've I've trans I'm transcending my

08:54.280 --> 08:56.440
Roll out my native

08:56.440 --> 09:02.840
Yeah, fuck it you transcended your native what I don't know the thing that makes me naturally an asshole

09:02.840 --> 09:07.040
Tell me or tell me more about your epiphany then well, it doesn't yeah

09:07.040 --> 09:12.840
I mean whatever she that that was just her report card. I and I don't I don't that's not that's not why I do therapy

09:12.840 --> 09:19.840
I don't do it to win. I would say but I won if my lesbian therapist reached across the table and fist bump me and then give me a

09:19.840 --> 09:23.880
Little footsie kick. I would say that's that's certainly transformational

09:23.880 --> 09:29.320
Right, you have graduated and she's a married lesbian by the way for those who don't want Jesus Christ

09:30.320 --> 09:32.320
No

09:32.480 --> 09:34.480
No

09:34.840 --> 09:36.840
Dear heaven

09:37.640 --> 09:41.640
Boy, damn was about to talk about a spiritual epiphany

09:44.840 --> 09:46.840
Rob

09:46.840 --> 09:53.640
I'm in the house until it said a truck

09:54.240 --> 09:56.240
Yes, Sarah needs you tonight

09:56.920 --> 09:58.680
Hey

09:58.680 --> 10:00.520
Welcome

10:00.520 --> 10:02.520
to me

10:04.040 --> 10:06.040
Welcome

10:06.560 --> 10:08.560
To you

10:08.560 --> 10:19.880
Oh, you made a pretty brave entrance

10:22.040 --> 10:26.680
Steve said hey, you just walk up on stage. Well that people love that and

10:27.520 --> 10:34.440
Not it didn't go wrong at any point. It's it's it was it was just funny to watch you charge into the Lake, Michigan

10:34.840 --> 10:36.840
on a banana leaf

10:36.840 --> 10:41.000
And like it could be a boogie board. It's probably not gonna be a boogie board

10:43.240 --> 10:45.240
It's charged into it

10:48.120 --> 10:54.560
Well, I'm what did I interrupt spiritual journey you you've you've got something you got something he was transcending something

10:54.720 --> 10:58.560
Well, we open the show with a something I just came up with in the moment

10:58.560 --> 11:03.160
Oh, let's hear it. I thought I said let's do let's open the show with the with the ad

11:03.160 --> 11:07.800
And we'll do a me undies ad. Well, we'll still they'll still get there much

11:07.800 --> 11:11.880
No, no, no, they got their ad if what we did in the beginning was that's not good enough for me on these

11:11.880 --> 11:15.880
Then my me indies can go fuck themselves. Well, for all I'm wearing them right now

11:15.880 --> 11:22.240
They might have paid for a middle of the podcast ad we don't all I'm saying is they're still gonna get whatever they paid

11:22.240 --> 11:27.280
I was at the march yesterday for our lives for the kids that don't want to get shot to death in schools

11:27.280 --> 11:34.840
And I I went through my me and these drawer and I was like, what's the right me and these underwear to wear at a march

11:34.840 --> 11:37.000
For kids that don't want to get shot to death at school

11:37.000 --> 11:42.920
And I had them it's the ones with little peace signs, you know that the much loved ones were those cone

11:42.920 --> 11:45.000
I had my where's the peace sign

11:46.000 --> 11:52.560
The peace fingers, you know, where's the peace fingers? It's all over. There's a bunch of little tiny peace signs. It's not there

11:52.560 --> 11:54.560
I might I might still be wearing

11:54.560 --> 11:56.560
Don't

11:56.560 --> 11:57.680
Don't

11:57.680 --> 12:04.560
Don't yeah, don't do it. I might still be wearing. He's still where the ladies gentlemen wake up in a ditch

12:05.920 --> 12:07.520
I

12:07.520 --> 12:09.520
woke up with a taste of

12:10.080 --> 12:12.760
Probably no gun control laws in my mouth

12:13.800 --> 12:20.760
Because nothing matters. Well, yeah, I wore my actual gun control me and these they had like guns with X's on them for real

12:20.760 --> 12:24.560
Yeah, no, so that's probably why it didn't work as you weren't wearing the right underwear

12:25.560 --> 12:31.600
Don't put what was your ad at the beginning of the show. It was a great Andy's ad. Yeah, I did I did like a

12:32.160 --> 12:35.480
Do well, why don't we just we'll run through it? Let's just start it over

12:39.960 --> 12:46.680
Dan Spencer, how about this we redo it? But now Rob is in the scene. Okay, he gets to interact that way. It'll be way better

12:46.680 --> 12:50.520
But Rob, you don't have that sounded sarcastic. No, it didn't

12:53.560 --> 12:57.900
All right, I mean if you want to do the like you hey, I don't have the switch

12:58.400 --> 13:02.640
I wasn't talking to you. Well, you gestured to me. You look that you did a little bit

13:04.200 --> 13:06.200
Good night Spencer

13:07.760 --> 13:09.760
Ho ho ho

13:09.760 --> 13:10.880
Whoa

13:10.880 --> 13:15.120
Donner hold on there on the left there Jetson go

13:15.120 --> 13:17.120
slower on this

13:17.280 --> 13:24.840
Now melting rooftop. Oh, I guess it's a little easier to land on it now that it's April

13:25.800 --> 13:27.800
It's a living

13:30.720 --> 13:32.720
The chipmunks are out

13:34.320 --> 13:35.820
And

13:35.820 --> 13:40.320
I'm unpacking my bag of things to give to everybody

13:40.320 --> 13:47.200
I don't know who the fuck you are get the fuck of my roof. I got a gun over here. I got an AR 15

13:48.200 --> 13:49.400
me undies

13:49.400 --> 13:51.400
blind him

13:53.960 --> 14:01.880
The the underwear like bats and they like swarming huh try surrounding yourself in a variety of patterns

14:01.880 --> 14:03.880
But

14:07.200 --> 14:09.840
You'll have to be undies blocked all the bullets

14:11.080 --> 14:13.400
It must be the micro modell fiber

14:15.080 --> 14:16.920
Up into the sky

14:16.920 --> 14:23.320
Me undies and that's harm and chan.com slash me undies. You see how Rob being in the scene just instantly plused it

14:24.360 --> 14:30.320
Again sarcasm. No, that was honesty. That was proving that my past sarcasm was indeed honesty. I

14:30.320 --> 14:35.160
Think it's this that's making it feel sarcastic. It certainly makes me hard to read

14:35.720 --> 14:38.960
Yeah, yeah, put your hands somewhere else. No

14:41.480 --> 14:48.600
Spencer always listening he's answering answering a call from like the 1970s talk to me. Hello 1970s

14:48.600 --> 14:51.440
This is a McGillicuddy. I'm Mrs. McGillicuddy. Oh

14:51.440 --> 14:59.480
Oh, oh, by the way, I think you have to tell the audience. There's no there's no guests tonight and there's nothing. There's nothing. There's no video. You would be wrong

15:01.120 --> 15:03.120
And I don't think I have anything

15:03.760 --> 15:10.520
Isn't Rob Schrab a guest enough? No, of course. He is Rob Schrab is guest enough. He's a regular

15:13.000 --> 15:15.400
Dr. Guest enough after guest enough

15:15.400 --> 15:23.160
Welcome to another edition of Harmontown. I'm your host Dr. Guest enough tonight

15:23.560 --> 15:31.320
We're gonna be watching Godzilla versus Mothra and we'll be learning how to make Jell-O ice cubes

15:33.520 --> 15:40.400
Now here's a commercial for Kmart your saving place

15:40.400 --> 15:47.760
Ma'am, do you know why I pulled you over? No, I don't offer sir

15:48.160 --> 15:56.920
It's because you didn't get these savings at Kmart. Oh shirt ripped open. Look at the size of those big savings

15:58.120 --> 16:02.680
Oh this week at Kmart 20% off all brands and competing brands

16:03.240 --> 16:05.800
Total of 40% off of each brand

16:05.800 --> 16:11.760
So brands are an additional 5% out. I'm so it's a cumulative effect

16:11.760 --> 16:15.680
So if you get three sub brands, you'll have a total of 15% off brand

16:17.000 --> 16:20.920
Related numbers. I have a coupon for motor voting put it

16:20.920 --> 16:32.360
You put it in your life put it in Kmart

16:32.360 --> 16:41.320
Oh no, it's me and these okay. All right, so that's how that would have gone right

16:41.320 --> 16:51.720
All right, well the epiphany that I had in therapy was that uh, I

16:54.240 --> 16:56.240
You're gay

16:56.720 --> 16:58.720
There's uh

16:59.360 --> 17:01.640
Nothing wrong with that every everybody

17:02.680 --> 17:08.080
In the world no matter how far away they live from anyone else like

17:08.880 --> 17:10.760
we're all like

17:10.760 --> 17:17.400
You know, we're all in a crowded warehouse. You can't you can't move and not touching everybody

17:17.400 --> 17:19.080
It's like if you go to

17:19.080 --> 17:22.720
Anything where there's a bunch of people like a crowded warehouse, right? Like a crowded warehouse

17:27.800 --> 17:33.000
I'm really undercutting my epiphany. It doesn't sound that good anymore. I'm just I'm totally listening

17:34.000 --> 17:36.500
but but but I I I

17:36.500 --> 17:42.060
Have been making mistake of because if you if you if you pursue

17:43.180 --> 17:48.220
What you want like if you follow your goal like a like like whatever that goal is

17:48.220 --> 17:49.820
But it can't be too complicated

17:49.820 --> 17:51.140
It can't be for instance

17:51.140 --> 17:53.140
I got to get out of the warehouse

17:53.220 --> 18:00.660
Because then you're just gonna get irritated because all you can really do in the in the foreseeable future is like move through a bunch of

18:00.660 --> 18:05.820
People but your goal might be like I want to get to the west side of the warehouse. I've never been over there

18:05.820 --> 18:13.860
And and but ultimately the whatever the goal is it all falls under the giant heading of I

18:14.900 --> 18:16.900
Want to be happy

18:17.060 --> 18:19.060
So therefore

18:19.380 --> 18:20.880
And then you have these good goals

18:20.880 --> 18:25.140
So the thing has to be not about the people that you're like

18:25.820 --> 18:31.780
The then there's all this stuff. So you have to whenever you move through a crowd you you're constantly having to go

18:31.940 --> 18:34.260
Excuse me. Sorry. No, that's okay. That's all right

18:34.260 --> 18:39.620
There's people it's just a mess, you know, people are a mess like we we we we

18:40.220 --> 18:42.100
we just

18:42.100 --> 18:47.500
Everyone's at cross purposes and you're trying to be polite and graceful and you don't want to be a part of the problem

18:47.500 --> 18:51.100
And all of that stuff's happening and it's causing you like a lot of anxiety

18:51.940 --> 18:56.100
So like my epiphany was that I I have been

18:57.220 --> 19:02.700
Because of maybe like early on I was like, oh, wow, it's so this this is the worst part, right?

19:02.700 --> 19:08.220
It's the part where you have to go like this. So what what can I do about that part?

19:09.660 --> 19:13.060
Which made me feel like I was being in the moment and being

19:15.340 --> 19:17.340
Like aware

19:18.340 --> 19:20.340
because if

19:20.420 --> 19:22.620
people who think about their goals are

19:23.740 --> 19:28.180
Heartless people because then they walk through everybody because they're going that way

19:28.180 --> 19:35.500
But you don't have to choose between those two things like I was but the people who when we shrink back like that

19:35.500 --> 19:39.380
And we go, oh, I need my goal is I want to be the best person in the world

19:39.380 --> 19:44.140
I want to be I want to I want to not step on any toes and or

19:44.660 --> 19:51.380
If someone steps on my fucking toe this time, you know, like that we get into those moods like I'm just gonna police my fucking like

19:52.740 --> 19:55.260
You're drawn back into this like

19:55.260 --> 20:00.820
Thing and then like you could do a lot of good that way you could even be like

20:01.380 --> 20:04.620
You could become a kind of art installation because you could be like

20:05.500 --> 20:11.460
Here's what I'm gonna do because of the situation like I'm gonna stick my thumb in my mouth and like blow on it and like I

20:12.020 --> 20:14.020
like like but it

20:14.780 --> 20:20.340
This is the part where I can't bring it home, but I'm just saying like now I understand like

20:20.340 --> 20:24.020
The people that I like are the people that

20:25.020 --> 20:31.820
They don't they don't shrink back that far to the point where they're just doing what everyone's doing

20:31.820 --> 20:36.560
Which is going I hope nobody hates me because if we all do that

20:37.420 --> 20:41.660
Well, maybe arguably that would be utopia, but like I

20:44.380 --> 20:46.380
Think we like I

20:46.380 --> 20:51.020
Want to like follow this meandering

20:51.260 --> 20:54.820
Dot of I want to be happy and get better

20:55.500 --> 21:03.780
Having accepted that any path takes you across everybody. I want to get better at saying excuse me and I'm sorry and

21:04.300 --> 21:11.120
You're forgiven and oh no problem and excuse me. No, I didn't see are you saying like it's the

21:11.120 --> 21:16.280
It's the like when you're when you're trying to navigate through that crowd

21:16.280 --> 21:22.080
And you're and you're trying really hard not to bump into anybody not to interact and not to step on anybody's toes

21:22.080 --> 21:26.680
But also you don't want to touch sweaty people or anything like that. That's what's making you

21:27.240 --> 21:31.280
Not happy or miserable and you should just learn to kind of like be okay

21:31.880 --> 21:38.200
Bumping into being touched or or like oh hey, how you doing or being is that what you're saying or is enjoying?

21:38.200 --> 21:44.640
Well, I'm using as a model and saying like you know first of all no wrong answers except for each individual

21:44.640 --> 21:51.080
So let's say that you don't like the let's say that that's like you're so there's some people that go to a concert because they genuinely

21:51.080 --> 21:53.080
Want to like fucking like?

21:53.560 --> 22:00.920
Rub up against people or be even be punched by them or risk that factor like there's there's just and then there's

22:00.920 --> 22:07.960
Serial predators who are flocked to the situations of a crowd because they can grope you and pretend

22:07.960 --> 22:12.800
They're not it's not their fault or like like there's there's no value to this situation

22:12.960 --> 22:17.860
Like there's no good and evil observable. You just zoom in on the individual

22:18.480 --> 22:24.280
Are you within this writhing sea of people that you can't escape?

22:24.280 --> 22:34.280
Are you going to define your entire life by the moment-to-moment like oh?

22:35.760 --> 22:38.880
That guy wouldn't have done that if you had any respect for me

22:38.880 --> 22:43.680
And I stole I just hurt that person more than I should have and I said literally out of the others

22:43.680 --> 22:50.960
It's like you're talking emotional and physical like like like like like emotional interactions or simply physical interactions

22:50.960 --> 22:54.400
I'm talking about I'm talking about down in the

22:55.840 --> 23:00.360
Encounter-to-encounter level of your right human existence

23:00.360 --> 23:05.920
And then not pulling back to the size of a planet so that you become a nihilist and go sheeps to the slaughter

23:05.920 --> 23:13.560
Give me more bacon and forensic file like I'm saying like if you pull back to a resolution

23:13.560 --> 23:20.280
That's like one person's anxiety about every encounter they have to have as they move through life

23:20.280 --> 23:28.080
As one corpuscle in a stream of them or one cockroach in a nest of them or one of like like like pick

23:28.080 --> 23:32.920
Whatever beautiful or a disgusting thing you want to say we're part of a biomass

23:33.360 --> 23:38.920
So if you pull back a couple of those human units not a thousand not a million

23:38.920 --> 23:41.640
but just like ten or something like

23:42.160 --> 23:47.840
the amount of energy it takes to decide that you want to leave a party because

23:47.840 --> 23:49.840
you

23:49.880 --> 23:51.880
Don't like it like

23:52.680 --> 23:59.640
Well in order to do that, I'd have to like I might be so intent on leaving this party that I'm gonna end up hurting

24:00.160 --> 24:01.680
like you

24:01.680 --> 24:08.200
You could just charge out you could charge out the door metaphorically you could like knock over coffee tables not to mention

24:08.400 --> 24:12.240
step on someone's toe without apologizing and or and then

24:12.240 --> 24:20.400
Like even God imagine like the Irish goodbye factor of like I didn't even the Susan was upstairs taking a shit when I left

24:20.400 --> 24:24.480
And I don't know yeah, you said bye to me and not taking a be lying out the door is

24:25.400 --> 24:30.240
Yeah, like I've always considered it. It's a dichotomy between

24:30.960 --> 24:34.160
there's a binary choice between total self-interest and

24:34.680 --> 24:38.440
Altruism, but it was that was not true

24:38.440 --> 24:44.480
it was a binary choice between living a life of total self-paralyzing anxiety and

24:46.120 --> 24:48.320
Knowing who the fuck I am right

24:49.200 --> 24:51.200
Like because this is easy

24:51.520 --> 24:57.120
Being anxious going everybody hates me. Everybody loves me. I hope I don't do that

24:57.840 --> 25:03.240
Again, it's like it's like I'm like that's my excuse to like do nothing and go nowhere

25:04.000 --> 25:06.600
So have you put that into play like no

25:06.600 --> 25:08.600
I

25:09.480 --> 25:11.480
Just thought of it like Friday

25:12.840 --> 25:19.360
But well, how about us? Can you put that into play? Can you like activate that part of you?

25:19.560 --> 25:24.880
Well, I opened the show with a Christmas ad from Yundee's fucking did I had a

25:25.440 --> 25:31.020
Epiphany with my therapist this week. You found out she was my therapist. No, and then I paid

25:31.520 --> 25:33.520
on you. It's a different therapist

25:33.520 --> 25:35.020
Uh

25:35.020 --> 25:37.020
You're spying on Rob through your

25:40.120 --> 25:46.320
You paid a therapist like somehow like you did like a fucking inception thing or no not inception

25:46.320 --> 25:49.880
Sir, that goes against the game Michael Douglas thing that led them to their

25:49.880 --> 25:51.880
That goes against my Hippocratic Earth

25:52.480 --> 25:57.640
Everybody has a price. Yeah, and you've paid so much that she's just now gathering shit on a draw

25:57.640 --> 26:02.520
Yeah, or or honestly if they're a therapist and they said like don't you think this is kind of unhealthy?

26:02.520 --> 26:06.000
You all you have to do is say or is it so healthy?

26:06.840 --> 26:08.840
Dot dot dot and then they'd be like

26:09.720 --> 26:11.720
Me there. I

26:12.080 --> 26:16.960
Required to consider that possibility. I'm a therapist. What was your epiphany Schrab? Well

26:17.600 --> 26:23.720
I think it's similar to what you're saying if I'm hearing you right Dan. It's like because I was like I've been

26:24.240 --> 26:29.760
Telling her about like what I'm going through like creatively and how I'm just like I wake up every morning going

26:29.760 --> 26:35.960
It's over with and I'm tired and I'm just sad and I just I don't have the juice anymore

26:35.960 --> 26:38.240
And it's not fun and and she says oh

26:38.680 --> 26:42.160
It's like if I'm alone and I'd Kate's been out of town all week

26:42.160 --> 26:48.080
So I've been really kind of phone just like phoning in my life and sleeping all day and eating like shit

26:48.080 --> 26:52.080
And I just have like the voices in my head are just being very the critical mind

26:52.080 --> 26:58.000
Yeah, the critical mind is like just like you know on overload and and so she she was like saying that

26:58.000 --> 26:59.320
like

26:59.320 --> 27:01.320
the critical mind is is

27:02.160 --> 27:06.680
Well, it goes back to being like like the lizard brain in your head where it's like saying

27:07.720 --> 27:09.720
Stay in your cave

27:09.960 --> 27:16.880
Stay away from the unknown. Keep your belly full. Don't take any chances risk averse

27:17.200 --> 27:22.080
Yeah, exactly. Don't do any of that because it's because it's edit and it makes you

27:22.080 --> 27:29.120
To survive the biological Fed has set the interest rates higher, right, right to speak and

27:30.280 --> 27:32.120
like add like

27:32.120 --> 27:39.920
Like like that's all like our like ancient, you know primitive instincts already in our head then add on top of like trying to

27:40.360 --> 27:47.200
Being socially domesticated and all that and voices of your parents and teachers capitalism. Yeah. Yeah, and so so

27:47.480 --> 27:49.480
She was like she was like

27:49.480 --> 27:55.240
She was like saying like could you befriend that voice in your head? You know, could you befriend it because

27:56.240 --> 28:01.880
Really that friend that voice in your head is a friend is somebody who cares about you

28:01.880 --> 28:07.200
That's only trying to protect you like when they say what it when it's like, don't don't dream too big

28:07.480 --> 28:14.720
Don't dream too big or you're you know, like because why why is that voice telling you that because it doesn't want your heart to get broken

28:14.720 --> 28:16.720
but in order to

28:16.720 --> 28:24.160
Achieve what you really want to do. You have to risk right that and and and and so

28:24.520 --> 28:26.520
you know if you could

28:27.280 --> 28:31.240
Have a conversation with that voice in your head and say hey

28:31.840 --> 28:39.120
Listen, thank you. I'm sorry. It was so angry about trying to push you away. I should embrace you

28:40.320 --> 28:42.640
I know you're all I was just trying to help

28:44.320 --> 28:45.840
Bruce Willis

28:45.840 --> 28:50.320
Bruce Willis. Yeah, I know you're trying to look out for me

28:50.320 --> 28:56.320
Yeah, but sometimes I got a run over the glass. Yeah, don't you ever think that Bruce Willis is your critical voice?

28:56.320 --> 28:58.840
Maybe you should take seriously. Yeah

28:59.360 --> 29:03.440
No, no, I should I should I mean if Bruce Willis was my critical voice

29:03.440 --> 29:07.400
I would be like this whole towers gonna go down buddy. Yeah

29:09.360 --> 29:11.960
What do you want me to do just sit here and watch it happen

29:11.960 --> 29:16.760
No, I don't want you to I don't want you to sit there. I want you to what what do I do?

29:16.760 --> 29:18.760
What I don't know. I'm asking me

29:19.560 --> 29:21.000
hold tight

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
wait for the police

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
It's a Hudson Hawk trailer

29:32.040 --> 29:38.880
Well, I thought I was trying to be poignant in that the the critical voice that doesn't it's not always the noid from

29:38.880 --> 29:45.080
That that's the thing is like I think that's what we're afraid of of confronting is that like oh, yeah

29:45.080 --> 29:47.480
But my critical voice is actually it's not

29:49.120 --> 29:51.120
Ugly booger man from a car

29:51.440 --> 29:56.240
Lot commercial or it's like I hate high prices or low prices or whatever that guy would hate

29:56.240 --> 30:01.200
It's more like the little seeds. He probably hates high prices. Hey, I hate I love high prices

30:01.200 --> 30:03.200
Oh, I love them or I am high

30:03.200 --> 30:10.680
Well, a booger a booger man would probably hate low prices. I think I this is from if you haven't seen it watch the

30:11.920 --> 30:14.960
Early Robert Zemeckis film starring Kurt Russell used cars

30:15.360 --> 30:19.360
They do a commercial in it and the guy has to play high prices

30:20.280 --> 30:22.780
Oh, yeah, does he play it? I

30:23.800 --> 30:26.320
Think he's like I remember him is looking like a

30:27.160 --> 30:28.400
Fruit of the loom guy

30:28.400 --> 30:33.280
I can't I can't remember what the costume was we had like come out and then like they did like a squib effect like

30:34.560 --> 30:39.640
Like like high prices fuck you and they like they blow them up with a shotgun or whatever

30:39.640 --> 30:45.160
And it's all like squibs and blood and stuff and you know, it's like these guys are underdogs like they're

30:45.920 --> 30:47.920
They're they're too effective

30:48.640 --> 30:51.040
That's selling used cars. Yeah

30:51.560 --> 30:53.560
They're too effective

30:53.560 --> 31:00.320
So, yeah, so I mean putting it that way like befriending the critical mind and realizing that

31:00.880 --> 31:06.200
It's it it's actually something that doesn't hate you and doesn't want you to fail

31:06.400 --> 31:12.360
It's just trying to protect you and so if when that voice or that that attitude is in your head

31:14.440 --> 31:19.120
She's a get into the habit of saying thank you I understand

31:20.440 --> 31:22.440
Go fuck yourself

31:22.440 --> 31:27.560
You know being being nice just like I understand trying to help me here

31:28.080 --> 31:30.080
but this and

31:30.400 --> 31:37.160
Usually I would like pay attention to you like not run out into traffic, you know not eat bad food or it's time to get out

31:37.160 --> 31:41.200
Of bed or whatever, but this is a time where I need to risk

31:41.920 --> 31:47.460
Being hurt. I think the pain is worth it. So I'm gonna need you to just

31:47.460 --> 31:54.220
Trust me on this one and then and if in the voice, you know, we if you know it well enough will go, okay

31:54.900 --> 32:02.340
I'm here if you need me, you know, just that that's beautiful. I love that and it really it started thinking of it that way it really started

32:02.700 --> 32:04.220
kind of

32:04.220 --> 32:09.780
Reprogramming here. I can think like that's a wonderful idea like like I used to draw a lot

32:09.780 --> 32:13.260
But I don't draw anymore because the reason I don't draw is I think I'm mad at it now

32:13.260 --> 32:17.340
Yeah, because something in your head saying, so why are you doing? Why are you doing this?

32:17.340 --> 32:20.060
You know, you're just gonna draw the same stupid shit you always draw

32:20.380 --> 32:23.700
But I need to befriend that voice and say well, let's just try

32:24.220 --> 32:26.940
Yeah, let's let's let's what's the worst thing that could happen

32:26.940 --> 32:29.780
The only way to get better at it is to keep practicing it

32:29.780 --> 32:35.540
So why don't you be quiet for a bit or watch me or if I fail guess what you're right?

32:35.540 --> 32:40.820
Yeah, but who cares the same or tell me how to make it better. Yeah, you know like say like if it's like

32:40.820 --> 32:47.180
Oh, you're you're cross hatching is bad or you're just okay. Well, that's something I will concentrate on instead of just like going

32:47.660 --> 32:53.540
It's over with don't even try because that's that's what what the lizard brain is trying to do

32:53.540 --> 32:54.540
It's like yeah

32:54.540 --> 32:56.540
Don't go into the dark forest

32:56.540 --> 33:01.580
Well, a lot of times we get programmed to go like you got a you got a you got a punch that

33:01.860 --> 33:07.380
No, you can't voice in the face and you're and it's like that actually could be the

33:07.380 --> 33:11.580
That lizard like to the extent that it wants you

33:12.860 --> 33:19.860
Mitigated ie like that's what a that's what a sheep dog does it's like kind of vaguely threatens the sheep because it loves them

33:19.860 --> 33:23.540
Wants to keep them in a certain area. Yeah along a certain path and so

33:24.140 --> 33:30.180
Getting mad at it actually is part of its function. Whereas if if you were a sheep and you wanted to

33:31.060 --> 33:33.820
You know, maybe supersede a sheep dog's authority

33:33.820 --> 33:38.380
because maybe you're a sheep that wants to herd to go in a different direction the

33:39.100 --> 33:41.900
actual practical thing to do would be to not like

33:42.540 --> 33:43.900
Tangle with the sheep dog

33:43.900 --> 33:50.340
But to like go around behind it and bid a good day and well be nice to it. What you want me to go over here

33:50.340 --> 33:54.340
Okay, it sounds like a good idea because you probably how long have you been a sheep dog?

33:54.460 --> 33:57.620
Like like like it's kind of you kind of crazy because you look kind of like a sheep

33:57.620 --> 34:00.140
Like your fur is like my friend, but they don't turn yours in the sweaters

34:00.140 --> 34:06.760
How is that is that Jeremy over there? And you just kind of like you're not enemies with the critical voice the threshold guardians can be tamed by

34:07.580 --> 34:11.700
Assimilation I think that there's like on a pseudo scientific level or whatever

34:11.700 --> 34:15.540
I think that you're what you're talking about is the survival mechanism

34:16.220 --> 34:19.980
associated with firefly which is associated with heightened state of emotion states of panic

34:19.980 --> 34:25.460
Yeah, and I think that when you engage in an emotional angry traumatic way to those

34:25.460 --> 34:32.420
Feelings on an emotional level like you would if someone is telling you your shit everything it gets you into a more emotional state

34:32.420 --> 34:37.140
Which is more prone to that part of your brain whereas what you're describing is a very rational

34:37.140 --> 34:41.540
It's the other part of your mind the societal kind of control part of your mind. That's that's not at all

34:41.540 --> 34:46.820
It's divorced from that that lizard part and it sounds like you're intentionally not trying to

34:47.380 --> 34:55.380
Channel those pathways that reinforce what what the negative stuff is saying and you're you're instead choosing pathways that take you away from that

34:55.380 --> 34:58.260
So you're out when you say you're reprogramming. It's what you're doing

34:58.260 --> 35:04.100
It sounds like is actively reprogramming the way you're thinking. Yeah, it's also a very subtle simple idea is that?

35:04.580 --> 35:06.140
befriend

35:06.140 --> 35:12.340
The part of you that argues with yourself because the thing that you think hates yourself when you get like a lot of people are going

35:12.340 --> 35:16.980
Oh, I hate myself or whatever because the critical mind is like going through every little

35:17.580 --> 35:22.980
Piece of your life every second of your life going you did that wrong fucked up. What a new you're gonna wear that

35:22.980 --> 35:28.660
What's that on your face? It sounds like a fan. That sounds like a big fan. Yeah. Yeah, you've got like a reddit in your head

35:29.700 --> 35:32.660
That is like saying everything you do is a comment section or whatever

35:33.060 --> 35:39.460
But but yeah, but the the the reality is is those those voices and run reddit are your biggest fans

35:39.540 --> 35:42.740
Otherwise, they wouldn't be paying attention to every second of your life

35:42.740 --> 35:50.580
But the a lot of us, um, you know, well just speaking of me we were I mean, we're all we're all monkey dogs when we come out of our

35:50.580 --> 35:59.460
Mothers and we're just eating food and rolling around and we wouldn't dress or bathe unless somebody went no stop it, you know, and so

36:00.260 --> 36:02.740
You're you learn how to become a

36:03.500 --> 36:08.960
Civilized human being by being told no stop it Robbie. No now stop it

36:09.220 --> 36:14.500
No, do you have to do that? And it's like you hear that voice over and over and over again and that was

36:14.900 --> 36:20.100
That's programmed into your head and still into adulthood. I hear my mom's voice going no

36:20.100 --> 36:22.580
Oh, you're lazy stop doing and this was

36:23.380 --> 36:28.100
This is just her way of saying I'm worried. Yeah, you're not hear that voice when you're

36:29.140 --> 36:32.020
Doing something has nothing to do with the things that she was in charge of

36:32.100 --> 36:38.260
Yeah, just keeping you from falling downstairs walking to the street touching hot stoves like it's not even that person anymore

36:38.260 --> 36:41.860
And I'm not that that she was you only had that relationship with that stuff

36:41.860 --> 36:45.140
But then it's called toxic shame when it's like misappropriated

36:45.140 --> 36:53.460
But it's very much like like when lolly is barking at a skateboard that goes by I've learned to what is this thing?

36:53.540 --> 36:56.580
Yeah, I learned that if I clap my hands

36:57.540 --> 37:02.180
She'll like go like like she'll like flinch and she'll stop barking

37:03.060 --> 37:09.140
And so like if I so now whenever she does anything bad like I'll clap my hands not even

37:09.540 --> 37:12.180
Hard and I'll be on the other side of the room and she knows that that's

37:12.180 --> 37:17.540
Time to stop, you know, so I'm her critical mind now every time

37:18.100 --> 37:23.780
She thinks she's doing something that she's gonna be in her head thinking like and if she wanted to succeed as an animal

37:23.940 --> 37:26.740
She would learn to befriend of that critical mind

37:27.300 --> 37:33.220
Perhaps fetch its balls once in a while and then one fateful day eat its throat in its sleep

37:34.020 --> 37:37.540
And go into wait, that's a girl. That's over the line to me

37:38.180 --> 37:40.180
Killing me. Yeah, I'm gonna

37:40.180 --> 37:43.220
So I'm killing me is over the line. Yeah, it's a

37:44.980 --> 37:48.020
You're reacting like I like I said something bad about

37:48.900 --> 37:50.900
Like I made a joke about hurting an animal

37:51.460 --> 37:56.500
You're the oh, I'm I'm a I'm your friend. All right. All right. Okay. All right

37:57.300 --> 37:59.540
Well, uh, the boot the the boot uh

38:00.820 --> 38:02.420
Spencer

38:02.420 --> 38:04.100
Hey

38:04.100 --> 38:07.060
Do you do you ever hear the story of the Christmas without underwear?

38:08.020 --> 38:09.220
Oh

38:09.220 --> 38:11.220
No

38:12.420 --> 38:16.420
There's an old story about it. What the fuck is happening to

38:19.140 --> 38:21.140
Hello little children

38:23.460 --> 38:26.420
There'll be no underwear for Christmas this year

38:28.100 --> 38:30.100
Yes, I'm sorry to say

38:30.740 --> 38:37.300
All the underwear is made out of the horrible shit cotton and not even close to micro modell

38:37.300 --> 38:39.300
Oh, yeah, so

38:39.940 --> 38:46.340
Uh, no Christmas this time. Oh, no, my balls are rubbing up against this not diamond shaped pouch. Oh, what?

38:46.340 --> 39:11.620
I'm dead 500 years later

39:11.620 --> 39:15.700
And that was a story about the Christmas with no underwear

39:16.740 --> 39:19.540
Uh grandfather. Yes

39:20.420 --> 39:25.700
What under garments could they have wand had well, they could have had

39:28.020 --> 39:30.020
Beyondies

39:32.100 --> 39:34.100
Neil Young is that you? Yeah

39:34.100 --> 39:36.100
Is

39:39.780 --> 39:41.780
But there's a buddhist

39:42.340 --> 39:47.780
Parable, I don't know of what I speak it comes to me courtesy of my therapist

39:49.620 --> 39:53.380
It's the the thing that you're we're talking about we're talking about befriending the critical mind

39:53.380 --> 39:57.540
There's also like the you know, it's this there was this goddess

39:57.540 --> 40:03.460
Uh named Mara. I think who at some point where the buddha was

40:04.180 --> 40:08.100
Doing his thing on the tree which was like taking a shit ignoring everything

40:08.820 --> 40:13.540
And then there was like temptations and things and there was a goddess named Mara that was particularly like kind of

40:14.260 --> 40:16.660
You know tried to get in his head and um

40:17.780 --> 40:21.780
The phrase I see you Mara like you don't have to be like go fuck yourself

40:21.780 --> 40:28.100
Die by fire or whatever like you just like you actually acknowledge you feed the troll

40:28.740 --> 40:32.340
Uh sometimes. Yeah, maybe all the time. I just got like yeah

40:33.380 --> 40:36.740
I I I I my my my erstwhile

40:38.100 --> 40:40.100
trainer Dave Kline said of

40:40.660 --> 40:42.660
people who troll

40:42.740 --> 40:44.900
like something I thought was kind of profound which was

40:46.100 --> 40:49.060
Actually, even those people they're just trying to connect with you

40:49.060 --> 40:52.660
Which is different from from giving them credit for doing anything

40:53.620 --> 40:58.260
Smart or funny or cool. You can still like look down on them and go you're a dumb piece of shit

40:58.580 --> 41:04.500
That's that's would that that is choosing this method to try in some ways to connect with me

41:05.140 --> 41:11.780
Like like there's absolutely no like they might be lost to cynicism and like all this shit, but like

41:11.780 --> 41:20.980
It you got to admit they're like still there's like that's their disease that they're going like I wish I had an effect on you

41:21.060 --> 41:24.340
Yeah, just like kind of kind of uh uplifting

41:24.660 --> 41:30.100
It it is it's interesting because whenever you hear that critical mind

41:30.820 --> 41:39.220
Voice in your head in whatever form it is your first instinct is to go shut up. Leave me alone go away

41:39.220 --> 41:43.700
And a way to deal with it and it never works. It always comes back

41:43.780 --> 41:47.700
But a way to deal with it is to when it when it goes

41:48.260 --> 41:53.460
You're a piece of shit. Why are you? Why aren't you working right now? If you would just like say

41:54.820 --> 41:58.740
Okay, hold on. Why are you saying that to me? I work an awful lot, but why

41:59.460 --> 42:02.980
Why right now any jobs you want me to have as many as it takes, you know

42:02.980 --> 42:07.460
It's like like it's asking it what it wants. Yeah, what do you want? What would make you happy?

42:07.460 --> 42:09.780
What would make you critical mind?

42:10.580 --> 42:12.180
stop

42:12.180 --> 42:16.980
Like saying that to me just to sexy me by the way instead of it's it's Maya not Mara Maya means illusion

42:17.300 --> 42:22.180
Oh, okay. It's Maya. I hear you. That's amazing that it means illusion like the software

42:23.140 --> 42:26.260
Yeah, like like the animation software the illusion software

42:28.660 --> 42:32.260
It makes it make yeah, I make stuff that isn't real. Yeah, I guess sorry

42:32.260 --> 42:34.260
That's not true. It wasn't a punch

42:35.540 --> 42:40.500
I'm trying to I'm tabulating in my head. I'm like did my therapist fuck up that name or did I?

42:42.020 --> 42:47.060
But I don't know why I would you said Mara and I I just shot a granted church because if anybody would know it in the

42:47.060 --> 42:48.900
Building it would be her and she was like

42:48.900 --> 42:51.540
Yeah, she shook you off like Johnny bench sure

42:52.900 --> 42:54.900
Oh, you do

42:54.900 --> 43:03.460
I see I see I see you illusion. Yeah, that actually makes it more profound instead of creating like just another like crazy lady character

43:04.580 --> 43:11.700
Uh, yeah, that's interesting. Uh, yeah, wait church. You want to come up and talk about like photographing the the march, uh, uh

43:13.140 --> 43:15.140
Bring up church

43:15.700 --> 43:21.860
Chorts she's charts. If you're a starbucks person from columbia, she's charts

43:21.860 --> 43:25.380
Because they don't know how to spell church

43:28.820 --> 43:30.740
Hello, hello

43:30.740 --> 43:32.740
with the with the the of course the

43:33.380 --> 43:39.780
Terms of service agreement that all guests check which is that at any time you may say a word or syllable that makes me launch into a

43:40.340 --> 43:41.860
sputtering

43:41.860 --> 43:43.860
rant about how I'm not racist

43:43.860 --> 43:51.540
But uh, we were yeah, we went down to the march and uh, I kind of I just I thought it was I

43:52.100 --> 43:56.100
I I don't know. I don't know how to tee you up. I'm not a good tear

43:56.500 --> 43:59.540
But uh, because I don't want to make you feel pretentious and say like church

43:59.540 --> 44:02.900
Why don't you talk about how profound the imagery you captured was?

44:03.220 --> 44:09.380
But it was like but but actually just like I thought it was cool you talking about how it was sort of like ducks in a barrel

44:09.380 --> 44:13.620
Uh for photographers because of the simplicity of the theme you want to go from there?

44:14.260 --> 44:17.540
Well, yeah, I mean what I noticed in what was making me so emotional

44:17.700 --> 44:23.300
I mean aside from just what was actually happening, which is seeing so many kids and even really really little kids

44:24.020 --> 44:25.860
marching and

44:25.860 --> 44:27.700
angry and

44:27.700 --> 44:29.380
thoughtfully

44:29.380 --> 44:33.780
expressing that anger and having these brilliant signs that

44:33.780 --> 44:39.140
I just I could I could not stop crying when you guys walked past me at a certain point

44:39.140 --> 44:43.380
I stopped and just stood there and let the crowd kind of like move toward me and around me

44:43.940 --> 44:49.060
Because that's the the best way to see everything because if you keep just marching with the crowd as a photographer

44:49.140 --> 44:52.980
You're you're surrounded by the same 20 people as you move down the street

44:53.060 --> 44:57.780
So for me, I I I stop at some point and that just seemed like the right place to stop but

44:59.300 --> 45:02.420
All the other protests that I've photographed

45:02.420 --> 45:08.420
If you looked at all those photos together would look like they could be any protests because you see

45:09.540 --> 45:14.420
A lot of the same signs because we have so there's so much intersectionality with all of these issues

45:14.500 --> 45:16.900
There's so many issues happening at the same time

45:17.780 --> 45:24.340
And so you're seeing the same things all the time. There's always the the rainbow afro guy with the john 319

45:24.660 --> 45:27.160
It's all the 360. I love john 319

45:27.940 --> 45:29.940
Doesn't get enough play

45:29.940 --> 45:31.940
For god also doesn't love the people

45:33.460 --> 45:35.940
He all he loved them. He also didn't

45:37.380 --> 45:40.260
Sorry, I was I was trying to interject very quickly

45:40.580 --> 45:47.140
Can just you've been to a lot of these how big we was the big right? It was big. I haven't seen the final numbers

45:47.220 --> 45:52.580
But the thing that takes them a few days to tabulate and kind of estimate the crowd size, but it seemed it seemed really big

45:52.740 --> 45:56.820
There were over 800,000 in dc. That's the only number I know so far

45:57.380 --> 45:58.420
but

45:58.420 --> 46:00.420
because the point was that

46:01.220 --> 46:06.180
This was the the only protests that for me in pictures. You know exactly what it is

46:06.980 --> 46:14.180
And it's completely on one topic right there's nothing else being talked about and you can see that in just the images

46:14.420 --> 46:19.700
And even if you like let's take partisan politics aside and people say that I hate the

46:20.900 --> 46:25.300
The g.o.p. Or I'm a total liberal or like I'm anti or pro n.r.a

46:25.300 --> 46:28.580
If you just look at the the children that were there

46:29.140 --> 46:32.420
The expressions on their faces were different than other protests

46:32.580 --> 46:39.060
They looked scared and pissed off and I like what if like I'm trying to picture myself if I were

46:41.380 --> 46:45.780
Thirteen 14 16 18 I was still in school

46:46.740 --> 46:51.380
What side would I fall on and how angry would I be in which direction?

46:51.940 --> 46:53.380
I might have been

46:53.380 --> 46:56.580
The pro second amendment guy. I might have been the

46:57.380 --> 47:01.780
Fuck the second amendment guy. I don't know but watching kids

47:02.740 --> 47:05.620
Look fucking miserable and looked really

47:06.820 --> 47:09.140
There's a couple on church's instagram

47:10.020 --> 47:13.220
There's that last one. There's no sign the girl might have just been tired

47:13.940 --> 47:16.100
She might just be a kid that was tired of being in a march

47:16.500 --> 47:21.220
But there's a picture of her looking right at camera and she just looks fucking sad

47:21.220 --> 47:24.500
And I look at those photos and I just start crying

47:25.220 --> 47:27.220
because

47:27.220 --> 47:28.180
um

47:28.180 --> 47:29.940
I put myself

47:29.940 --> 47:31.940
in those little shoes

47:32.260 --> 47:33.940
and

47:33.940 --> 47:38.740
I don't give a fuck what you think about gun rights or gun legislation or whatever

47:39.380 --> 47:44.980
There's a bunch of fucking kids that are afraid to go to school. I have a niece that's fucking eight and I've got

47:44.980 --> 47:52.500
Friends that are like have children that are going to school and let's not make it about politics or make it about trump

47:52.500 --> 47:54.980
Or make it about paul ryan. Who's a cunt?

47:55.940 --> 47:57.940
Sorry, I meant to say cunt

48:02.260 --> 48:08.340
What what's happening is like imagine being a kid going to the mall now going to a movie theater like it's fucking crazy

48:08.340 --> 48:15.620
We shouldn't make celebrities out of emigrant solace for being the first cool chick to get up and say a bunch of awesome stuff

48:15.860 --> 48:18.980
I think that's dangerous. I think like that puts her in a bad situation

48:19.460 --> 48:24.420
But I think that you should go around and look at church's photos and look at the kids that were marching that day

48:24.980 --> 48:26.100
um

48:26.100 --> 48:28.100
They're scared. They're the friends are dying

48:28.420 --> 48:33.860
They're scared. They really are and my nephews were going to march and then my sister texted me

48:33.860 --> 48:39.060
On friday night and she said that my my nephews had kind of had a little bit of a panic attack about it

48:39.060 --> 48:42.820
That they wanted so much to be a part of it, but that they were really scared to go to the march

48:43.460 --> 48:45.700
And so she said, you know, you don't have to go

48:46.820 --> 48:51.540
Um, let's write letters to our representatives. Why don't you why don't you call?

48:51.860 --> 48:54.900
We'll call our representatives and you can get on the phone and you can leave a message

48:54.900 --> 48:56.900
You can read your letter and leave a message

48:57.220 --> 49:01.700
But like kids are genuinely panicked and that's kind of one of the things that seeing that

49:01.700 --> 49:03.700
at the march

49:03.940 --> 49:05.940
Looking into their faces

49:05.940 --> 49:11.140
And seeing how seriously I mean I watched very young like four or five year old kids like

49:11.620 --> 49:16.420
Who seem to very much understand what was going on and have really real feelings about it

49:16.500 --> 49:18.660
So there's all these accusations floating around

49:19.300 --> 49:20.020
like

49:20.020 --> 49:26.420
Oh, they couldn't possibly understand and they're too young to get it and they're just parenting their parents views or they're being manipulated or whatever

49:26.420 --> 49:29.620
But like, you know what go to one of these marches and look at them and say it to their face

49:29.620 --> 49:34.900
Because they seem to understand. Yeah, that's the thing that I wanted to interject with was I'm sure there's

49:35.620 --> 49:40.340
Plenty of cynical people who have plenty of like whatever you we've discussed this

49:41.140 --> 49:43.140
comments on her photos and my

49:43.140 --> 49:46.660
Photos of spencer holding a sign. There's there's a lot of hate

49:47.060 --> 49:50.340
But here's the thing is like you look at the imagery like yeah

49:50.340 --> 49:55.540
I don't even want to it's like we'll look at the relationship between the parents and the children and the imagery

49:55.700 --> 49:58.740
Look at look at the mothers with the daughters on their shoulders

49:58.740 --> 49:59.700
um

49:59.700 --> 50:06.580
And go ahead and start from the point of assumption that the little girl doesn't have any fucking idea what a gun is

50:07.140 --> 50:10.820
And understand how much more sad this becomes

50:11.620 --> 50:14.100
Because it's a photograph of a relationship between

50:14.660 --> 50:18.260
A mother and daughter, but they do the kids are now having to learn

50:18.820 --> 50:25.300
Like the cold war where they had to do duck and cover drills because of um doomsday like nuclear warfare

50:25.300 --> 50:33.860
They now have to go have quiet the quiet game the silent the silent game anybody anybody with that kind of critical voice of like of like

50:34.020 --> 50:37.380
Like oh the kids that they don't know how could you make this their problem?

50:37.380 --> 50:42.900
It's just like we've definitely got to the point where that that argument is so fucking dumb

50:43.460 --> 50:50.340
Because that's exactly everyone's argument like and that was the really effective like kind of somber mood

50:50.420 --> 50:53.540
I thought a lot of the signs and stuff was like the theme was

50:53.540 --> 51:01.140
Whether it was a parent that made a sign for a kid or the kid that made a sign for themself like the overwhelming theme was like

51:02.900 --> 51:04.900
I shouldn't have to be

51:05.220 --> 51:09.700
Involved with us. I don't this shouldn't be it shouldn't have come to this

51:09.940 --> 51:16.020
I shouldn't be a voice in this conversation. We should we should have all been on the same page about me a long time ago

51:16.660 --> 51:22.900
I I think like yeah, etc. So there was one little girl in particular that make made me think that and I watched her for a while

51:22.900 --> 51:28.260
I have a bunch of pictures of her and a little bit of a video that I posted of her with her little friend too

51:28.500 --> 51:30.500
that one's crazy and

51:30.900 --> 51:37.060
Her mother had a sign that just said save her and was pointing down because she knew her daughter would be at her feet most of the time

51:37.780 --> 51:40.420
Which is what caught my eye and made me start watching this little girl

51:40.740 --> 51:44.820
Then her and her friend were like watching these older kids standing on a barricade

51:45.860 --> 51:50.980
And they were you know chanting like this is what democracy looks like and we call bs and all this

51:50.980 --> 51:57.060
And at one point these two little girls and one this one girl just had such a look of concern like she was looking around like

51:57.700 --> 52:02.180
Isn't this obvious? Yeah. Yeah, like look at all these people and they were chanting

52:02.740 --> 52:09.220
Vote them out vote them out and she was staring at them and then at one point she just started

52:09.860 --> 52:14.340
Vote them out. Yeah vote them out like she had like a realization of like yeah

52:15.380 --> 52:19.620
That's what we do and yes vote them out. She was stomping her little feet

52:19.620 --> 52:23.620
And I just burst into tears and she looks like one of those photos

52:23.700 --> 52:28.580
I forget the photographer that took those great photos of the great depression of the little

52:29.060 --> 52:33.860
Yeah, the kids the little girl covered and covered and like you know soots her dirt

52:34.740 --> 52:38.180
And the scared look on her face and she looked

52:39.460 --> 52:46.260
Absolutely concerned. Yeah, like like scared miserable and she's like this isn't a drill

52:46.260 --> 52:52.900
This isn't some actual shit and if people want to say oh the parents were brainwashing them. Fuck you

52:52.980 --> 52:57.220
Yeah, but also just imagine like you're five you play the silent game

52:57.300 --> 53:01.700
It's been explained to you what it's about you're going to go and you're going to hide and you're going to stay quiet

53:02.020 --> 53:06.420
For as long as the drill and then you're going to get a little treat if you stay quiet the whole time

53:06.740 --> 53:10.180
And then going to the march and putting into context

53:11.300 --> 53:15.620
What is actually like this is the silent this is what the silent game is about

53:15.620 --> 53:20.260
This is what everybody's yelling about. Yeah, and everyone's holding signs of pictures of rifles

53:20.820 --> 53:22.820
It's sign that say no more silence

53:23.300 --> 53:29.540
Stop gun violence. Fuck silence start screaming this little girl stomping that video you took is is

53:31.220 --> 53:34.740
We're sitting at the redwood. I was like we're just crying. It's fucking crazy

53:35.460 --> 53:38.100
You guys seem like you need uh-oh

53:38.900 --> 53:40.900
A safer place

53:40.900 --> 53:45.940
M c gun control. Is that you it's me mc gun control

53:48.180 --> 53:55.140

54:35.700 --> 54:37.700
What side of gun control are you on?

54:39.460 --> 54:42.500
Some people say you're in the pocket of an array lobbyists

54:42.500 --> 54:48.660
Listen, listen. Yo, you're gonna listen to my heart. That can't be that can't be about that

54:48.740 --> 54:54.100
That's how we got to where we're at. You understand mc gun control. It's not about

54:57.140 --> 54:59.140
Agenda and propaganda

54:59.380 --> 55:05.540
Okay, it's about straight to the issue. Is it not true that you received 375 thousand dollars that we got away last year?

55:06.260 --> 55:08.260
Okay, look

55:08.820 --> 55:10.820
You have to understand that that is

55:10.820 --> 55:11.940
Is

55:11.940 --> 55:14.980
Not what you're describing is it was already crossed off

55:16.260 --> 55:18.260
My appearance writer

55:18.180 --> 55:19.780
and

55:19.780 --> 55:21.780
I should uh you

55:22.660 --> 55:27.460
Is this live just answer the question uh, we were allowed to ask this question. Is it true that you will see

55:28.260 --> 55:30.260
$75,000

55:30.660 --> 55:37.380
Are you admitting that your parents writer is money from the nra? Sorry, well, I don't even not that I need to ask

55:37.380 --> 55:43.220
But what that's a regular part of your parents writer is accepting money from the nra is what you just said

55:43.220 --> 55:46.180
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, this is is clear

55:46.340 --> 55:50.340
Yo from west coast to your ear gonna go to the north to the south

55:50.900 --> 55:58.340
Through the spirit out the math gun control is an issue. Yo get your mama to shoot gotta be aware

55:58.740 --> 56:04.340
Of gun control there. Yo, okay. Bye. So that's what you owe me $500,000

56:04.340 --> 56:06.340
Oh

56:08.420 --> 56:13.140
That was a bad gun control. He went up the chimney. That was uh, wow that

56:13.700 --> 56:18.500
Jeff is did you see me making those throat-cutting gestures? Like I was like, did you how what are you doing?

56:18.580 --> 56:20.580
You were like interrogating our rapper, but then

56:21.060 --> 56:24.980
Holy fuck. Yeah, I you it you you were part of the problem

56:25.380 --> 56:26.500
What me?

56:26.500 --> 56:30.900
No, not you empty gun controls. Yeah. No, I didn't know I look when we booked him

56:30.900 --> 56:38.420
He it's it said gun control issues. I like gun control like I don't I don't like like like it's an awareness of gun control

56:38.660 --> 56:43.140
I think that you're kind of one of those liberal elites that thinks when you hear the name mc gun control

56:43.380 --> 56:47.140
You think he wants to ban guns. Yeah, no, he wants to he's an anti-gun

56:47.780 --> 56:53.140
He's he wants to open the debate about gun control, but it's very clear that he's in the pocket of the nra

56:53.220 --> 56:59.540
Yeah, he wants to talk. I mean what trigger locks. What I mean, isn't it come on the people who act like this issue is complicated

56:59.540 --> 57:05.380
I should have known I should have known but I just I never even I just wanted to get into the game and like

57:05.700 --> 57:07.700
Help people, you know, I thought that was all fine

57:08.180 --> 57:10.180
Really? I thought it was fine

57:10.740 --> 57:14.500
I thought it was fine. I thought it was all right an argument could be made that mc gun control

57:14.580 --> 57:19.460
If it's true that all he wants to do is is rap about gun control awareness

57:19.460 --> 57:23.940
He just wants to talk it was to open up the issue that then whatever you come into the whatever you experienced

57:24.580 --> 57:26.100
Once you're aware

57:26.100 --> 57:31.300
Then we would hope I would think that the reason we want what we want is because more people want it so

57:32.100 --> 57:33.460
so

57:33.460 --> 57:35.460
Look, I was shocked about

57:36.340 --> 57:38.900
To hear that he said he was paid by the

57:39.140 --> 57:44.180
Well, he I was simply asking the question and I didn't get a good answer. I'll tell you I heard

57:44.820 --> 57:46.820
He said that he had crossed it out

57:46.820 --> 57:52.260
But at one point his parents had a writer where they requested money from the nra. I think

57:52.260 --> 57:59.700
Three three hundred seventy five thousand dollars per gig. He was trying to argue the point that he was only allowed to talk about certain bullet points

58:00.740 --> 58:02.740
Yeah, I can't even look

58:03.860 --> 58:06.020
Yeah, the elephant man is back on display

58:06.580 --> 58:11.860
Um, I'm sure this will make all the writers and the there are Mike in the chimney indie wire

58:12.500 --> 58:15.140
Uh tomorrow look, I want to just

58:16.260 --> 58:19.940
If I may speak since that seemed to be the attraction of the century

58:19.940 --> 58:26.500
Um, if I may if I may I assume that my voice is something you'd want to hear am I

58:27.940 --> 58:31.540
Correct in that can we go back to the question that I asked you just get a simple guess or no

58:32.420 --> 58:33.940
okay

58:33.940 --> 58:36.420
Did you or did you not receive money from the nra?

58:38.020 --> 58:40.020
At any point in the last year. No

58:40.980 --> 58:42.980
So you did not receive

58:43.780 --> 58:47.700
Three hundred and seventy five thousand dollars from the gun lobby. Here's the thing

58:47.700 --> 58:49.700
Okay

58:50.020 --> 58:52.020
The foundation that pays me

58:52.660 --> 58:56.260
Is an awareness raising organization they have that they

58:56.900 --> 59:02.900
That money came from the nra. Yes, it did not go to guns

59:03.700 --> 59:09.620
To us the nra is an awareness organization. That's why they're tax exempt. Are you just talking about the nra again?

59:09.940 --> 59:16.580
Yeah, I look you can play gotcha games. Like if you say anything enough, it'll sound real, but like

59:16.580 --> 59:20.980
I don't know that is it that is a fact the nra is tax exempt because they are raising awareness

59:21.620 --> 59:28.020
Okay, I mean I don't do taxes. So like I'm not an accountant personally. I'm just a trigger guard

59:29.300 --> 59:36.180
And I'm in favor of gun control. Um, and I'm a rapper. We have those are those are three things that

59:37.060 --> 59:38.340
Are true

59:38.340 --> 59:42.740
And then the thing that you said I got back on that like that's why I came back

59:42.740 --> 59:46.500
I got I neutralized that I got that. Are you a rapper?

59:48.900 --> 59:52.100
Uh, yo, yo, I'll yes or no, yo, I'll let uh

59:53.140 --> 59:55.140
The rapping you heard

59:56.180 --> 01:00:01.300
Why don't we we were gonna go to commercial but can we put a beat on just to find out whether or not you're actually a right?

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:11.140
No, no, no, I don't know that rap was weak. Yeah. Uh, it was weak. Oh shit. It's it's it's it's dj gunman. Yeah

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.140
Yo

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:37.140
Oh

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.140

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:59.940
Okay, we have we have to go to commercial. Yeah mesothelioma is a problem

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:08.020
And uh, go to mesothelioma book to get your mesothelioma book if you suffer or you or any member of your families

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.500

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.860
Uh, that uh, we talked to our lawyers, uh

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:16.420
All right, we're back with don

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:22.580
We're back with don lemond. Uh, it's the second time you've you've jokingly cut to a commercial

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:27.940
But then the fact that you actually did a joke commercial like it would have been the perfect place that every commercial

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:34.100
CNN every commercial is mesothelioma can't all we do is mesothelioma commercials

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.300
No, that was hard biting commentary

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.300
Oh

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:32.820
It starts off as like a

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:38.820
Breaking news we're going to go back to the first thing we're talking about for 45 minutes

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:43.700
Because CNN doesn't know what breaking news is. Oh, yeah, there's an empty chair

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:47.700
We think Trump might have sat in it or we'll sit in it sometime

This will be eight hours of of a static image of video

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.940
A lot of sides. Oh shit. Fucking go home

My album

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:01.460
Drops. Yeah, do you want to do a plug before we go back to Miso Thileoma commercial?

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:04.820
Yeah, I got a mix tape coming up two mix tapes

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.780
one

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:09.540
Side each

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:16.020
Good for your mix tape. That's good because if it if it didn't have a like a second side it would be like

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:21.140
We actually we mentioned oh, we actually have enough time to play one of your tracks

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:24.420
Can we play your new hit off the off the a side? Well, you know how mix tapes work

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:28.660
You usually use in other people's work. Yes. Yeah, so I don't know if you can play that

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.980
Let's play a clip of your that's not what I call your a side

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.220
No, we have we have enough time

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:38.100
So let's can we can we get the a side to the head to and I hear there's a comedy break in the middle of it

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:43.540
I hear you go into some gun control kind of stand up, but still rhymes

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:44.900
That's for you to decide

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:50.580
I heard that halfway through you broke your ankle and then the rest of the recording is just a live transcript of the hospital

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.420
Yep

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.700
I heard you also got John Lithgow to do a guest

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:05.300
There's the doctor. Yes, you actually collaborated with me on this track. John Lithgow and Vincent Price to to be on

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.460
To be on this track with you

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:13.460
In the time it took you all to describe that there's a wrap about gun control with Vincent Price in it

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:16.420
It goes into a sketch that gets interrupted with an injury

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.220
That's part of which is real audio from the hospital trip

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:24.020
But then we did pick up so John Lithgow was the doctor. You could have just listened to the track

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:28.900
We were why don't we we would just enough time before our last commercial break. Can we get a beat on?

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:33.540
It's 9 11. Oh, is that an alarm the clock is making?

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:43.540

Ow my leg

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.820
That really happened though

01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:51.860
No

01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:54.660
Leave it in the song

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.740
Leave it

01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:00.100
No, leave it. No, leave it

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.100

Vincent Price, Vincent Price breakdown

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:08.420
Spooky Vincent Price breakdown

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:14.660
One two bullets in my shoe spooky spiders coming for you

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:20.980
Everything sinister when you're gay and you're not allowed to say it today one day in the future

01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:30.660
I'll be allowed, but all the children will be over plowed with bullets. That's the real mummy

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.060
Special feature

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.740
Vincent Price posthumously come out

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:54.340
In that song. Yeah, he wasn't allowed back then right because it was sinister cellulite closet. Yeah, he probably saw that

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:58.500
But he wish he was here in today where he would be more accepted

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:04.660
But he's like how ironic my kids would be killed or yeah, my friends kids or my adopted kids

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.900
Yeah, because because okay. Yeah

01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:10.740
It's all right. Yeah, I like him better because he's gay

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:14.660
Dude, what don't even imply that that's not the case with me

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:21.860
You just tried to high road me about about gave in some price. He's my hero. You just made a mistake because I wasn't

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:27.700
Well, maybe you're obsessed with gayness because you think it's like more important than all the great work. He did

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:30.660
Pricing, I don't think so. Well

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:33.300
Seems weird

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:35.140

Looks like you guys had a real fun time at that toga party this weekend. Wow. Wow. Everybody got uh

01:10:55.140 --> 01:11:00.180
Just up and yeah, it must have been real nice. It's been real nice. Have fun. I've been invited to one of those

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.260
Wow, how how is that?

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.340
It looks good. Looks fun. Yeah

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.900
A lot of fun. You sent steve levy off to go. Yeah from the from the march for our lives

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:15.220
Yeah, steve levy had to go off and buy togas to a party that seemed pretty pretty fun pretty fun

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:18.660
Dino is there

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.500
Wow

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:28.900
Like every weekend, I don't I was a guest at a toga party. So you didn't have fun. I had plenty of fun

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:35.460
Okay, all right, this is guilty. I can't invite other people to uh, the friends of the voice in your head

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.300
We all like michael

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:42.260
It was his engagement party our friend michael waldrin who works at starburn's industry and you and you were like

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:46.420
Oh shab and and davidson and and aren't here. I guess okay

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:53.940
Dan probably just thought that we didn't support their engagement. So I don't think he that's probably why dan didn't invite us to michael's

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:56.580
I don't think he gave it a second time. I just remembered. I did a thing

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.620
Here's it. Here's a weird thing. I did at the part at michael waldrin's

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:03.780
Toga themed engagement party. He had a basket of

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:06.660
Of blankets that were kind of like

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.820
I think they're like

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:13.140
Like leave behinds like like like like party favors like you it's a toga party. You might get cold

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.540
We're on a patio take this night. They got ordered

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:19.060
They got a bunch of blankets and I think you could like wrap it around your shoulder and then leave with it

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.140
It's kind of a kind of a thoughtful

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.220
Interesting little artisanal idea

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.900
I uh

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.900
I started realizing

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:31.780
At some point I bet it's gonna get cold and I saw somebody wearing one of them and I here's what I did

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.380
I went down to the basket

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:39.620
Because I was I was like i'm hot right now the sun's out, but it's gonna get cold later

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.860
And these blankets are gonna be gone

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:48.260
So I took a blanket a free blanket that was like in a full basket like representing all this hospitality and I I

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:55.140
Like I imagine I was like hunched over like a like a candy cane posture because I became just the stop motion villain

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.140
I creeped off into the underbrush

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.660
uh

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.660
the outskirts of their home and I

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.580
Uh, it the blanket is probably still there right now because I hid it

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:11.540
I hid the blanket the way I hid uh the brown deer public library's only copy of slaughterhouse 5 because I had too many books

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.820
And I couldn't get it so I hid it because no one else deserved it

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.180
Jesus christ

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:22.900
So you never wore the blanket? No, I never needed it. It was fine

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:27.540
And there were plenty of blankets to go around you didn't go ahead retrieve it and put it back in the blanket

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:32.820
It wasn't the issue. You were too ashamed. Well, no, I never thought about it again. I'm a fucking sociopath

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:39.620
Dan I've known you for a long time. You've committed various crimes. That's that's your most egregious

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:44.020
I didn't I'm not a sociopath because like whatever the uh, I felt like like it was the opposite problem

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.420
A sociopath would be like well, maybe it'll get cold

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.060
I guess I could mug one of these people for their blankets or whatever

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:56.500
I was like never use it and never put it back. That's what a sociopath does. So you were there and you're like, oh

01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:59.860
I don't miss my friends

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:06.340
It's it's someone else's engagement party like what what do you guys want them to do invite every human

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:09.380
Look, I'm not even I'll have you know, I was invited

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:14.020
So now talk to him. He threw this shit away at the end of the march

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:19.780
Cody was like, okay, so like I'll see you later, right? And I was like what and she's like waldren's thing

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.860
And I was like what's thing and she was like

01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.660
Happens happens. I guess I wasn't

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:31.460
As soon as I was invited, but you know waldren probably better than I do the church because you work with him day in and day out

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:39.060
Day in and day out every day. Michael waldren. Also, Michael waldren is probably one of the biggest

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.460
Donators to the nra that works at starburns

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.460
I think he bankrolled

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:50.900
Follow the follow the money rob church follow the money on both sides. There are many sides to this issue

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:56.340
Follow the money is such a funny goddamn phrase. I remember like follow the money

01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:59.460
Somebody uh, somebody pointed out that pat say jack

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:06.500
Was uh that his his twitter account is just him in his twilight years kind of like he he was a big climate change denier

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:13.060
And then he would he would use hashtag he would he would say stuff about climate change being full of shit

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:15.300
And then he used the hashtag follow the money

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:19.300
He's supposed to follow the climate change non-denial money

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:25.860
Where does that money go? I mean, I guess we'll probably always work. He goes to pizza gate

01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:28.580
You know where that money goes to buying more valves

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:30.820
Yeah

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:33.220
Games at chuck willery. That's a hilarious joke

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:38.740
This is really good. See that's why that's why I missed the live audience because buying vows

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.060
Oh, it would have killed I

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.620
But don't you think it's nice that we got used to not needing an audience?

01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:48.740
I like that because it's like you just respect jokes for what they are regardless of the reaction they get

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:53.140
Or not laugh at them. Yeah, I just go like it's like it's like it's like we're gonna

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.260
We're gonna go start doing shows. We're getting kicked out of here next

01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:58.980
We're gonna start doing shows with an audience. Yeah, we haven't even mentioned that

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:04.580
I'm doing it. I'm doing an all-live show at the Saban theater in Beverly Hills. It's all um

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:07.300
Steven Tyler jokes

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:10.900
God dammit Jesus

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:17.140
By the way, the the week that you decided to take off is the week we had to do ads for the fucking boner pill

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:20.660
Bald people. Yeah that you talked us into doing what?

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:24.580
Yeah, I didn't talk. Oh, I please my god

I said, oh my we could make it funny, but it wasn't like I was like well, we made it funny

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:34.260
Yeah, me and Dan made a real funny. Can we play it back? Do we have do we have the audio on that? No?

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:38.660
I don't want you to yeah, but yeah, play it back. Let's take the time to find it and then

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.540
pipe it through the sound system

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:44.100
For the play it back for the no audience

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:47.860
For Jeff who hasn't heard it. Let's just take we're on a stage

01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.340
30 40 minutes at the top of this episode

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:54.180
We're we're on the stage with with lights, but with no audience. We're basically just

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:58.660
Do it glorified. Let's do it calar brothers

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:02.660

Wait, so you're saying that it's my fault that you guys did a bad boner pill ad or I'm not saying it's your fault

No, I don't you don't no one no one really we have a choice. No one should be forced to be here

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.460
Don't don't you don't you start to be here?

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:32.980
Yeah, I don't even know if you're asked to be here tonight

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:37.460
I don't know if I was asked to be here. You were supposed to be here. So you're definitely not

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:41.780
You were actually asked to not be at the sheriff that I believe

01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:46.980
I'm not doing that. I believe that I believe

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:51.860
Yeah, do you know in prison they call hands dick beaters?

01:17:55.860 --> 01:18:00.260

By a show of dick beaters. Can we get a show of dick beaters?

01:18:55.620 --> 01:19:04.740
It's good, right? I learned that on a podcast. Do you want Salisbury steak tonight or fried chicken?

01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:11.620
My show of dick beaters. Sorry, I've still tickled pink mother. It's funny.

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:20.020
You tickled pink my dick beaters. So I'm sorry I missed that show, but was it a goodie?

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:56.100
Hello.

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.540
I'm Lewis Johnson Jr.

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:07.700
I'm cured.

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:12.980
I'm cured. Goldbond powder cures Miso Thielenoma.

01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.860
And makes you fly. Goodbye.

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:28.820
Ditches and dragas do we play? Oh, yeah, let's play us. Let's play. Let's play a shitload of D&D.

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:32.980
All right. Well, how much is a shitload are we? It's I mean it's two buttloads.

01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:37.380
Oh, yeah. It's two buttloads. I want to know. Oh, I know. We're right down. We're right down schedule.

01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:43.380
All right. Let's bring our Steve Levy and maybe we'll say a sad farewell to church, everybody.

01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:51.300
Don't think it was listening to church. Think it was gaining a Levy.

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:56.020
My phone pronounces it Levy.

01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:02.900
You had a good time at the toga party.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:09.860
I had a great time. I shut that place down and closed it down last night. You were like, go home.

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:14.980
Yeah, get out of here. Yeah. He doesn't like you guys anymore. Get the fuck out of here.

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:25.300
Steve Levy is a caliber of performer capable of removing the human head at 50 yards. Now ask yourself.

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:35.700
Is that a powerful gun? We think it is at the M.C. Gun Control Foundation.

01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:39.140
Can't pin him down.

01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:50.740
Can't pin him down. That's the formula. It's like it's Pat, but ideologically Steve Levy.

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:59.700
Steve Levy. Yeah. Depending on your phone's preference. Steve Levy.

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.700
Have you ever seen? What?

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:13.620
So anyway, I was walking to the grocery store and okay.

01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:20.180
All right. Okay. It's been a thousand years. We might need a good proper five minute recap

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:27.780
to bring us back up to speed. I think I need a soda. I don't know that we have soda. All right.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:39.140
Oh, probably no music. I don't remember what happened. We were in Dornester and there was

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:43.300
Shrove and there was a dragon. They went into the theater and then they went to the basement and

01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:53.300
they they were about to enter the theater. So they had just not given up and Diarrhea ran off

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:59.300
and then you guys decided to look for him. You decided that the most obvious place to look for

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:06.100
him was in the theater and then you broke into the theater. You went into the kitchen. You went

01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:13.300
to the stage looking around. Oh, shit. There's soda. Someone get me a soda and then that one happened.

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:17.860
I have written down. Oh, you start making poop noises. We were making fart sounds. I think we

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:22.660
were bursting in in a fight. I think we just kind of burst in the door. We're about to have their

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:31.220
well that's the end. But yeah. So we're in the theater trying to rescue DJ. Yeah. So DJ is tied

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:36.500
up. Oh, thanks so much. DJ is tied up. Who else is tied up? Patchens is also tied up. And you

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:44.900
guys just burst through the room. And yeah, you were you were you were going. It was about to

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:50.420
be the start of combat or something. Here we go. Yeah. Who are we looking at? I look. I examine

01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:59.380
my surroundings. Hell yeah. That's the best thing anyone can do. Oh, fucking god damn it.

01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:04.900
Schrab. Schrab just spilled his kiss me. I'm Monday mug. You can get your

01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:09.220
so more kiss me on Monday mugs. Yeah, that's why I couldn't man. I couldn't if I tried.

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:18.420
All right. So you're in an under yeah, you're in an underground room. Shameless pretend

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:26.660
mugs pill just to sell more of your wonderfully reasonably priced mugs, which we've already

01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:33.460
heard of selling well, not that you need more more sales. There was a point. You'll get them.

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:37.540
There was a point in our Harmontown team meeting where we were mad that you're selling more mugs

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:41.700
and we don't have any merchandise. But Rob Schrab is cleaning up and that kissed me on Monday

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:48.420
mug business. The other one is closing in. We know that was the other part of the call.

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:55.460
How's your free mug? Ask dick. Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly what it is. Good old Garry Shandling.

01:24:55.460 --> 01:25:00.180
He sold a hundred of them. That's what I heard. He's cleaning up. What's the price point on one

01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:05.940
of your mugs, Rob? I don't know. I get like two bucks a mug. Two bucks a mug. That's almost

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:12.420
$200. Yeah. I mean, we shouldn't be so quick to fill his coffers before worrying about our bottom line.

01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:24.580
You can buy him on tpublic.com. Rob Schrab's store. I find him offensive and I don't think

01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:31.540
they'll forward slash. I don't give a shit. Forward slash Weinstein. No, don't even. Don't

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:36.820
even. Why you gotta do that? I'm just looking at. Why do you have to destroy? I'm looking at mine and

01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:43.060
I'm just trying to find out how to buy one of your one of your pro sexual harassment mugs. Stop it.

01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:50.100
Let's play D&D. Yes. Instead of shit. Rob's playing his character from Dead Ale Wives sketch.

01:25:50.100 --> 01:26:00.660
What? It makes sense to the right people. You're in an underground room. No. So you're in a low

01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:08.260
ceiling to underground room, black wooden stained wooden boards. There's low like from candles that

01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:14.900
are on the walls. There's a table and a couple chairs. Yeah. Diarrhea is tied up against the wall

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.300
and you see against the opposite wall. Patches is tied up. He seems knocked out. There's three

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:24.340
people who upon you bursting in the room just left to their feet and are scrambling for their

01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:38.580
weapons right now as we speak. Where am I? You are at home. I thought I came along. Well,

01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:46.420
they left. They left the town. Yeah, I thought I came along. You can. I thought I did. Okay. Well,

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:52.900
you will arrive shortly. Okay. I will arrive shortly. Like in one turn or so, but you'll burst

01:26:52.900 --> 01:27:00.820
in because you'll be catching up. Okay. So how close is DJ? How close are DJ and Patchens to

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:06.820
each other and how close to our foes here? DJ is 20 feet from you. Patchens is about 10 feet from

01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:16.660
you. And the enemies? They're like halfway. They're closer. They're kind of in the middle.

01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:25.060
They're humans? There's one orc. There's two humans in one orc. I turned to what's your name,

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:33.220
Carlos? As a Carlos, why don't you open the bidding on this ass kicking? Gentlemen,

01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:37.460
I've been put in charge of opening the ass kicking.

01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:49.940
I'm going to cast Summon Monster 2. Yeah. Okay. And I've selected the monster that I'd like to

01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:59.460
summon. All right. And its name is Goblin Dog. Sounds good. It's my favorite favorite. I'm gonna go

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:05.940
Goblin some dog, man. Goblin dogs, no. There's a built-in like they're not gonna attack my friends.

01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:09.140
Your Summon monsters tend to, I think, attack enemies.

01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:22.100
If you're just joining us, and I think that's how people watch information these days,

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:28.340
they flip through channels on their laptop. I've just summoned a Goblin dog. And it arrives

01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:33.860
presently. Whose name is what? Well, I didn't name him. Yeah, it comes from a different plane.

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:37.700
He's gonna be gone. I mean, I don't... I mean, it's a little... You don't want to get too close.

01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:44.100
Rufus. The Goblin dog leaps into existence. It has the frame of like a Marmaduke kind of dog,

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:51.380
but it's the shape and fashion of more of our giant rat. So it's like... Greetings! Oh. Oh, no!

01:28:51.380 --> 01:29:00.180
Oh, Rob's playing the guy. It does seem that way. I heard that I was summoned.

01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:13.140
Hey, Goblin dog. Yes. Do you have a name? Rufus. Rufus. The Goblin dog.

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:22.980
Well, why not cut the jibber-jabber and get to fighting? I'm going to cut some of this jibber

01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:34.260
and jabber. Let me put on my bib and my... pull out my knife and fork. And I'm going to go after

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:39.860
these baddies. Are you going to eat them, or do you use knife and fork as weapons?

01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:46.580
What knife and fork? I'm going to eat them. Okay. All right. What do you do when you put

01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:50.980
on a bib and you pull out your knife and fork and lick your lips? I have limited Goblin dog

01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:56.660
experience. I'm just... What the fuck are you doing? Sorry. Sorry. I am. You can do their

01:29:56.660 --> 01:30:01.620
taxes with a fork and a knife? Dan is fidget spinning for the audience. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:06.420
getting the light here. I better move. No, no, I'm just... No, that was a joke for Cody because I...

01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:11.220
Do you think she's watching? She's watching? No, she's probably... she's gotta be...

01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:15.540
She's probably in love with someone else by now. Okay. Here I go. Attack.

01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:23.220
Attacking. How do you do it? Describe it. Well, what I'm good to do is I have my knife,

01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:28.820
which is very sharp, and my fork, which has got four prongs in it. And I'm good to just kind of

01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:34.660
stab and cut and chew and bite and, you know, in between I'll dab my chin with my bib.

01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:42.420
That happens. You hit one of the guys as he's going for a weapon, and he takes five damage.

01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:45.780
Yeah, that's right. The fork and knife. Can you describe the damage? Like,

01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:52.340
I want to know how this Goblin dog uses his fork and knife. Like you'd use a fork and knife. There's

01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:58.020
little slices and... What is the big conundrum here? It's a fork and a knife. You go, what are you

01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:04.660
going to do with that? Who is... is he with you? Could somebody explain? He doesn't have hands.

01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:10.580
He's a dog. You don't know that. Steve, you're up next. I'm still tied up, right?

01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:21.540
Yep, but you can spend an action. Oh. Chad, untie me. I go over and untie DJ.

01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:26.820
Oh, that's great, because it's now your turn. Do you have dexterity? What's your dexterity?

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:34.100
Do I have dexterity? He asks. I do. Dexterity is 16.

01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:43.460
You're going to eat that, Mike, bro. Yeah, bro. 16. It doesn't... it doesn't work. It's... it's tied

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:47.780
really tight in the... in the thick of battle. You're telling me it's 16. You can't untie this.

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:52.980
You can't untie a rope? He's trying to avoid being hit and stuff, too. It's like your dodging attacks.

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:58.180
All right. Do I get... like, do I loosen it a little bit? Thanks for nothing. Oh, yeah, you loosen it

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:05.140
a lot. Okay, it's bad guy's turn. They finish scrambling to their weapons.

01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:11.780
You can see one of them is like pulling on like a big robot puncher glove kind of thing,

01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:16.660
like a big full body arm, and the other guy has something that looks kind of like a... like a hand

01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:22.900
gun. Just like a modern day handgun. And then the other guy grabs a sword and as he... and as he

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:30.340
holds it aloft, it's like... and it becomes fire sword. Oh, shit. Geez. I love fire. And then they...

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:34.020
they form like a three-man formation that looks dynamic. You guys are going to bring a fire sword

01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:42.180
to chad the fire like or fight? Can you over... light his sword so that it's just burning his hand?

01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:49.140
Kind of like it. Hang on. Do I have a spell that... I control fire, right?

01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:53.380
To an extent. There's a spell you have control fire. I think it's dance turn, though.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:33:00.340
Gentlemen, there's no need for a quarrel between the church of the silver flame and the dragon marked.

01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:07.860
I have to... you certainly seem to think you know what you're talking about, but

01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:16.900
none of that means anything to me. Oh. Haha. What? It's, you know, like this is during combat.

01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:24.340
Oh, right. Yeah. Well, I... I was mostly thinking that stuff. Oh, sorry. No, no. I mean, I thought

01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:30.740
I was gonna... I'm willing to... I did want to take a shot at like just communicating with them,

01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:35.300
and you're saying it didn't work. Yeah, they were the incorrect. So I kind of lose... I don't get to

01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:39.940
also then go, in that case, I'll smash their brains in. Yeah, no, you get free... you get free talking.

01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:48.260
Is that like... host privilege? No, it's within reason. You can... you couldn't like read a book,

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:53.220
but you could like have a few... Because I'm like charging my spirit hands and going, gentlemen,

01:33:53.220 --> 01:34:00.740
you really don't... okay. And now, here's the thing. Whoo-hoo! Boy, oh boy, I am gonna...

01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:08.980
I am going to cast Divine Favor on... No, you know what? Wait, wait, hold on a second. I want to see

01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:12.980
if there's anything I can do to get... Hey, room out! Let him talk. Well, I just want... I just...

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:16.580
for a second there, I was like, wait, I should be focusing on getting diarrhea free. I'm just saying,

01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:22.500
because they saw you kind of fishing. So I'm saying, let the man... I'm gonna cast...

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:40.660
I'm gonna cast Divine Favor on Chad, which just gives him plus one for every three levels.

01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:47.540
You've done it. You touch him with your magic finger, and it enhances him with God's might.

01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:51.220
I just thought, you're over there, you're doing great. Yeah. Just want to support.

01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:59.540
Goblin dog, signal boost. Okay, now it's my turn. I grab the nearest one by the leg and chew on it

01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:06.260
like corn on the cob. The same one you attacked? Sorry, I didn't hear that. The closest. Okay,

01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:11.860
let's say it's the same one. All right, you miss. You lunge it... I miss chewing on his leg. You

01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:18.660
lunge it his leg as if to chew. I miss it, so I'm doing this to the air that makes no sense. You find

01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:24.820
yourself chewing the leg of a table and or chair. Is it really dark? You can't tell because you're

01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:31.860
too close. Too close to the table leg. Or chair. Or chair to know if it's a chair. Have you ever

01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:36.900
tried to eat a guy's leg who didn't want his leg eaten? Yeah, I did last week. Were you there? No?

01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:43.140
Oh, okay. Because you wouldn't know. Sorry. So you chewed it, you successfully chewed the last

01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:48.820
guys? How did you know that he didn't want his leg chewed? He said out. Spence, I want to use my

01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:57.140
knowledge of engineering to get myself out of these... Ropes. Do you have that as a skill?

01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:05.460
Are there ranks by it? It says total bonus six. Okay, you do it. Using your keen like Sherlock Holmes

01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:12.980
movie vision, you see the holes in the knots and stuff and you are able to quickly shout

01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:19.700
the instructions necessary to shout them? Well, if you wanted, you could tell Chad exactly how

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:30.740
to do it since you can't you can't move, you know. Chad, you got to stick your thing in the loop

01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:37.380
here and then pull real hard and then go underneath me and then lift me up on your shoulders and then

01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:45.540
drop me real fast and then pull the biggest loop real hard. Like a yo-yo. I do that. All right,

01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:51.540
he flips around like a yo-yo and is very quickly on his feet and untied, although you don't have

01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:58.340
your stuff with you. I don't have my stuff. No, you can take some sort of action now because that

01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:04.900
was... Can I use charge to get my stuff? You don't know where your stuff is. Oh, I don't know where

01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:09.380
it is. Not off hand. You kind of just regain consciousness recently. All right. Well, I want

01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:15.540
to be a distraction, so I'm just going to run in circles yelling, eat my ass bastards and try to

01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:22.500
make them really confused. I'm not telling you not to do that, but you love that idea. Before you do

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:28.020
that, you get the sense that doing that will open you up to between three and seven attacks

01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:36.740
by realizing the rules of the game. That's how you know this stuff. But those would all be people

01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:43.220
who would otherwise attack us. Yeah, that's the thinking. But no, they're free attacks, so you'd

01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:53.380
be taking free damage. Three? Free. It wouldn't profit me at all if you did that. You can try and

01:37:53.380 --> 01:38:00.580
be distracting, but running near them in a circle, I think, is the most dangerous way to be distracting.

01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:07.860
Okay, well, then I look around the room while I yell, eat my ass bastards. Okay, so you're just

01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:14.740
trying to be distracting without suicide. It's not very distracting. They quickly clock that

01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:24.500
you're unarmed and just trying to be distracting. Yeah, I'm sorry. I need better dice. So did I die?

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:31.060
No, but your distraction is not distracting. Oh, do I see where my stuff is? No, you're just

01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:36.100
running around being distracting. Okay, that's fine. That's a success in my mind.

01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:47.620
I can I cast a level one and a level two or just like just one two different turns. Yeah,

01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:56.420
two different. Okay, tree shape, I turned into a tree. But there's a lead up to this,

01:38:56.420 --> 01:39:01.220
that there's going to be something else that happens. I just I become a tree that gives me

01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:07.220
plus 10 to my armor class. Oh, yeah. I'm a tree now. Are we like, we're in the middle of a room?

01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:13.460
Okay, I'm now a fucking tree in the middle of the room. And I kind of like, do I have facial

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:20.580
features or am I just a full on tree? You have two things that might look kind of like eyes. Okay,

01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:27.140
I take one limb and kind of like give my team a thumb like this is going to pay off. Yeah,

01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:32.900
but right now, I'm thinking on the fact that me turning into a tree in the middle of a combat

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:37.700
is going to fucking freak them out and put them off, like put them on their back heel for a moment.

01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:42.980
You bank on that. Yes, you're a beautiful tree. Thank you. A shambling mount appears.

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:55.140
How are you doing? Just coming through me and Gary. That's me too. I'm walking through the

01:39:55.140 --> 01:40:03.620
building and I'm seeing a tree and you and he and we're going to be friends forever. I'm here.

01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:08.980
What's going on, guys? The tide of the battle is turning.

01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:14.100
I thought I just honked. You fucking nailed that.

01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:22.740
Yeah, I'm a tree. I'm a tree. How are you doing? Play it cool, Gary. Hello. How are you doing?

01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:33.220
Play it cool. Dog creature. Well, I was summoned to help out here. Really? I gave you plus one

01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:40.660
on all of your defense and offense and you turned into a tree. I have another spell.

01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:47.300
Just do it. Get through another round and just watch. What? Somebody explain to me what's been

01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:53.780
going on since I showed up before. I turned myself into a tree. Talk without moving your limbs.

01:40:53.780 --> 01:41:00.500
Talk without moving enough speech to take a turn. What? This is a lot of speech. Right?

01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:04.580
We're in combat, so if you keep talking, then I'm not going to have... Well, I need to know

01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:09.780
what's going on. Well, you can see that with your sensory. I can see what happened before I showed up.

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:12.980
No, what currently is happening. But I don't know what's going on.

01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:16.980
No, you can see what's going on. No, I'm telling you, you can see what's going on.

01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:22.100
Before I came here, I could see what's going on. No, you're currently here and you can currently

01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:26.500
see currently what's going on. There's a fight going on. What's going on? I'm a tree and there's

01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:30.980
a fight. Get the guys that you don't know. Hit the people that you don't know who they are.

01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:35.700
Okay, I grab the guy who's got the flaming sword and I grab him by the wrist and I shake it.

01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:43.780
And I go, what are you doing? Put that down. Put it down. What are you doing? All right.

01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:51.620
What are you doing with that? Put it down. No, put it down. What are you doing? What are you doing

01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:57.380
with that? Come on. What are you doing with that? We're doing a flaming sword. Put it down.

01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:02.820
All right, you do that. You lunge at him and he slashes you with his flaming sword. It deals 18

01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:09.860
damage. Even after I was saying all of that? No, but then you grab him and then you grab him

01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:15.460
with your massive shambling arnhem and you crush his wrist. So now you're holding him by the wrist

01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:21.060
and you got him by his sword hand, but in that process you took damage. How much health does

01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:27.300
shambling have? Well, that doesn't sound good. No, no, you have a lot. That's what I was laughing

01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:32.500
about. But did you tell him that I'm saying all this stuff, that I'm shaking his hand and I'm saying,

01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:36.100
tell him that I'm saying... Oh, I told him. Put it down. What are you doing? No, I told him.

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:40.900
What are you doing? You slashing me? What if I did that to you? You wouldn't like it. All right.

01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:44.500
Wouldn't like it. Keep acting like this. I'm going to take your pants down from all these people.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:48.980
Whose turn is it? No, it's my turn. I'm going to give you a lickin'. All right. One of the guys,

01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:54.180
he identifies the shambling mound as the biggest threat and... Hey!

01:42:54.180 --> 01:43:02.020
Hey! I get known. I'm known here. This guy's the puncher guy. He's the orc.

01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:13.300
He tries to punch at you. He charges up his punch, right? And it's like this big robot device.

01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:18.260
And you can see it's all like warring and steaming and piston-ing and it just explodes.

01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:24.580
Oh. His fist explodes. Yeah, it just explodes. Like a misfire? Yeah. So that was a critical

01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:29.220
fail on a robot punch? Yeah, it blows him in half. Do he died? Yeah. Hell yeah.

01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:34.340
Through no fault of your own. You scared him to explosion.

01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:43.460
You see that? You see what happens? You see what happens? Drop it. All right. Put it down. The other

01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:48.900
guy shoots... He points the gun at you guys and shoots it and it fires like... It looks like a

01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:54.180
lightning bolt. If someone just casts lightning bolt and it just blasts through the room. It cuts

01:43:54.180 --> 01:44:00.580
through the room. It hits all four of you guys. What caliber is that? What caliber is that?

01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:06.820
For how much damage it spends? 4d6. No, 3d6. We all get hit? Yeah, you all get hit. I deduct.

01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:13.540
Yep. I can't remember my hit points.

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:20.980
Look at your sheet. Well, I'm looking at it, but I can't remember how much damage I have had.

01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:28.020
We all had healed before. It's not true. It's not true. Remember, I'm a tree right now with

01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:33.460
plus 10 to my armor class. Oh, right. And trees actually have lightning resistance. Yeah. I don't

01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:38.420
know if that's true. The shambling mound has got lightning resistance. That might be true.

01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:42.500
You guys are going to... You guys are going to be so proud of me when you find out why I turned

01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:47.460
myself into a tree. It better be a good pun at the end of this. It's not going to be a pun. I mean,

01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:52.500
honestly, I don't... I don't remember you having 14, but I could be wrong. Okay. I'll go with that.

01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:58.500
Sounds right. So, I now have... Five. Five. If I'm right. Yeah. Wait, we took 11 damage? No, he took

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:06.260
nine damage. You took 13 damage. Wow. You got hit harder. I didn't get any. I didn't take any damage.

01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:11.380
No, I got to see if you're resistant. Because I'm shambling. I shamble out of the way of the lightning.

01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:19.620
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You're immune to electricity. See? Yeah. And that's why you turn yourself into a tree.

01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:29.140
And he is... I'm a swamp thing, motherfucker. Motherfucker. I'm like swamp thing. I'm immune to electricity,

01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:36.100
motherfucker. Motherfucker. Motherfucker. I'm immune. Carlos, do you have a group healing spell?

01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:42.580
Do you have... If you have channel energy, you do. I have channel energy. Tune into channel energy.

01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:45.860
It wasn't what I was going to do next. You don't have to. And I don't even know.

01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:52.260
Well, I mean, I think I'm close to death here. Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone within 30 feet

01:45:52.260 --> 01:46:03.620
gets a 2D6 heal if I channel energy. Hey, no harm. All right. So, Dan, you get back five,

01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:06.980
and you two get back six. But you haven't taken damage, right? No, because I'm a tree. Right.

01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:12.260
Yeah. But I took damage before, man. Can I get some of that healing? You get six. I get healed.

01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:16.340
Six. I get six healed. Yeah. So you keep it track of this because I don't have a pencil.

01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:22.740
You're at 10 now. Somebody... I'm not. You're not keeping track of it? No. I mean, I'm loosely

01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:28.100
keeping track of it. Okay. Well, I'm loosely... How much HP does Chamling have overall? He's taken

01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:32.580
12 damage at this point. But what's his total? What was his total? You don't know. How much am I giving?

01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:39.620
Okay. Sorry. You go. Oh, no. Oh. What were you saying? Well, no, I cast the

01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:43.220
Chat Channel's Energy. Okay. It's Goblin Dog's last turn. Do you want to have him do anything?

01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:49.780
Yes. Give me something to do. Well, just attack... You could attack me? What did I do?

01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:56.900
It's his last attack before he goes away. Well, and Diarrhea Jr. has been freed of his tethers?

01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:02.660
Yeah. Okay. And yeah, these aren't complicated creatures. They're summoned, and they attack,

01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:08.500
and they don't attack. So, yeah, I have them attack the... Can I change that to the weakest

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:13.780
looking guy? Yeah. Which is... Which is what... Which one is it? Which is the weakest?

01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:18.740
Well, I... Which is the weakest one? Doesn't your Goblin Dog instinct...

01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:21.220
Kind of... Aren't you able to kind of sense weakness?

01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:30.660
Sure. Oh, that's your choice then. Okay. I attack the guy with the lightning gun,

01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:34.740
and I go up and I just... I just kind of chew on his face.

01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:40.740
All right. Chew on his face a little. Do you want to roll? You chew it. I did already.

01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:44.980
And? Five damage. You bite him right on the face. You rip open his lip.

01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:50.580
It's gross. Good job, Goblin Dog. Good job, Goblin Dog. That was...

01:47:50.580 --> 01:48:00.660
Young girls. Wait, Goblin Dog. Yes? Your name was... Rufus. Yep. Thumbs up.

01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:07.620
Going back to hell. He disappears. He returns to hell.

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:13.860
I really liked him. I liked that guy. All right, Steve's turn.

01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:20.180
I'm still a tree, right? Yeah. As far as I understand. Yes, sir.

01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:23.860
Do any of you guys have a weapon that I could borrow for this attack?

01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:29.940
Can a tree hand him a weapon? No. Your stuff is a tree. I'm a tree.

01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:35.300
Yeah, you would have been able to. Can I rip a branch off of... No. Yeah, you can.

01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:41.460
I could give you something. What do you got? I didn't...

01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:48.740
Sorry. I didn't describe this this time. I described it last time, but I forgot to...

01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:55.060
Yeah. There's a target. It's like a throwing knife target on the wall that's full of throwing

01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:04.740
knives. Oh, that's... I mean... Okay, great. Can I dart to the target? You're already near it.

01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:11.780
Oh, can I pull out... Careful. Three throwing knives? Are they heavy? Yeah, they're really light.

01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:22.740
Okay, so I'll pull out a couple of those, and I want to throw them at the fire sword's chest.

01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:27.940
Okay. His hand is being grabbed, so he can't dodge as well.

01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:35.700
Yeah. But you're not proficient. What's your dexterity? Oh, God. It's 15 plus two.

01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:44.420
Yeah. No, you miss. It whizzes by his head. Hey, what are you doing? I'm sorry. I thought...

01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:49.780
I'd be able to hit him while you were holding him still. It's Jeff's turn. Entangle!

01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:58.900
That was a big thing. Can I be my own entanglement device now that I'm a tree?

01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:06.100
I'm going to look it up, but let's just say yes for now. Because I now can use woodland the branches

01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:14.740
and vines to entangle plants, everyone in 40-foot radius. All right. I'm just trying to entangle them.

01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:18.740
So do we get entangled also? No, no, I'm aiming at the bad guys. That's the thing,

01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:23.140
is I feel like I'm going to have to look this up, because I think you might entangle anyone.

01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:26.980
Just follow your heart, follow your heart. I'm going to just say for now that it's just fine.

01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:31.540
Okay. But I think everyone technically might be entangled. But let's not worry. Everyone?

01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:37.460
Okay. Well, okay. If I find Tangle, everybody. So it's willy-nilly? I have no control over who I

01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:41.700
entangle? Well, it's area-based, and we're in a small confine. But I don't know. Let's just say...

01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:46.260
I had big plans. I know. Let's just say for now, because I'm not sure, and I don't want to look it

01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:52.340
up. Let's just say you... Fuck it. I entangle everybody, because we can talk it out. Yeah.

01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:58.820
We can talk this shit out. I want to be in that wrong... I entangle everything in a 40-foot

01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:05.780
radius, and I'm just a big entangler. Right. But it's not like chains or anything. It just

01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:10.660
makes it harder. It's like fighting through a maze. Okay. So I haven't changed anything. Well,

01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:15.940
you have. Yeah. They're definitely currently bound. They're just not... I was going to just

01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:22.020
tangle if fuckers happen. Well, what happens? There's a fire sword in the mix. Well, it's being held.

01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:33.540
Yeah. Oh. I got it taken care of. Yeah. Fuck it. I knew it this. I'm a druid that hasn't really

01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:37.860
figured this shit out. I just started entangling. Fuckers, now everyone's caught in my web of

01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:47.620
entanglement. Yep. And I hold his flaming sword up high away from the tangles, so they don't catch

01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:53.060
fire. Right. Yeah. Because they don't catch fire if it's held up high. That works. Yeah. And I'm

01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:57.940
still shaking it, and I'm telling him to... What is he doing? What are you doing? Don't do that.

01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:03.380
Thank you, Garry Shandling. You're welcome, Chad. Is that your whole turn? Do you want to do other

01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:16.340
stuff? Is it my turn? Yeah. I start kicking him. Kicking him in his shins. All right. I go and...

01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:24.660
You big man? You a big man now? You a big man? Does he answer? Does he ever say anything? How's

01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:33.620
Patchen's doing? Patchen's is unconscious. Does he say... He's probably entangled. He says ow. Yeah. You

01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:39.540
hit him for 16 damage. Oh, shit. What? You kicked the fuck out of his shins. Yeah. I'm kicking him

01:52:39.540 --> 01:52:44.900
in his shin and ass. Yeah. And I go, you stupid mother... That hurts more than the lightning?

01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:54.660
I don't know. Wow. You break his knees. Whoa. Yeah. You don't want to get a Shambling kick.

01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:57.700
Who's that? It's like Edward Norton in American History X.

01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:06.740
So the guy with broken knees tries to break free, and he does. He falls to the ground just trying

01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:18.260
to slice with his flaming sword, and he hits the tree, and so he's going to catch it on fire.

01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:27.220
Oh, come on. I love fire. Oh. I hope you love being on it. My name is the Fire Liker.

01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:35.940
All right. You take 13 fire damage. Bullshit. All right. He does that. The other guy,

01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:41.460
he's got the Zapcaster... Well, you don't know that's what it's called. That's really its name,

01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:46.660
Zapcaster. It's a working title, but yeah. Most of the stuff is behind the scenes terminology,

01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:52.820
because it doesn't come up. But yeah, he can't pull himself free from the entanglement to shoot

01:53:52.820 --> 01:54:01.540
anybody with his gun. Yeah. Because I'm a tree. Is fire damage over time? Yeah. Well, it'll keep

01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:06.740
burning. Yeah, it keeps burning unless it's put out. So now it's Dan's turn. So one person's dead.

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:11.300
One person is very crippled and on the floor. They only kind of managed to catch something on

01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:16.260
fire while they were falling out of the grass boom monster. And then the guy, the other guy's

01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:28.100
entangled. Oh. You're entangled, kind of. Okay. Well, is there anyone within attack range of

01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:34.740
melee-wise? Uh, no. You've been kind of out of the fray, I think. All right. Well, then I'm just

01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:46.260
gonna do a good old solar flare blinding everyone in the room. Can you do that more than once a day?

01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:52.420
Did I already do it today? You did it once today. Yeah. Because I did it in the bathroom? Yeah,

01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:58.500
that was the same day. I mean, I said I was doing a solar flare. It was the expression of how the

01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:02.740
tacos were hitting me. You might be able to do more than once per day. I'm not sure. No, it says

01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:09.620
once per day. No, it doesn't say that, but it doesn't say more than once. Okay. Well, try this

01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:16.740
on for size. How do you like this? Here's something I can do more than once a day.

01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:24.740
Zip. Yeah. Channel energy and heal everybody within 30 feet. That's what I do. I'm a healer.

01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:34.580
It's not a good ending, but... Do I grow bigger? No, but you heal. I'm already healed. You heal three.

01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:42.900
Steve heals six. Jeff heals four. Dan heals six. I'm not writing this down. It's fine. Steve's writing

01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:50.740
it down. Or if he's not, it's fine. No, I'm writing it down. Yeah, so everyone is healed for that

01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:56.180
amount. We got this one guy that's crippled. People are still untangled. How many rounds are they

01:55:56.180 --> 01:56:06.500
untangled for? At least two more. Steve. I mean, can I move at all? What's my...

01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:15.220
You're being entangled, so you can try to move, but you might fail. Okay. Is it sort of... Would you

01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:24.180
say like all the vines and stuff were sort of like its own dungeon? Sure. Could I use my knowledge

01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:33.780
of dungeoneering and maneuver through the... Oh, Steve. Wow. You can try. It's not a word game.

01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:40.020
It's a game of the imagination. You don't gain meaningful insight from the vines.

01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:45.300
Because they're not a dungeon at all. Or because you can't connect them to a dungeon.

01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:49.780
Maybe there's a dungeon... Because they're... They're vines. Well, maybe there's like a

01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:54.100
dungeon of the vines, but he's just never been there to connect... A dungeon of the vines.

01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:59.860
There is one. I'm saying it now. The bad guy is like, have you guys heard of the dungeon of the

01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:06.980
vines? Oh my god. Oh, damn. Wow. So is my turn over? Can I... No, you just don't know. You...

01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:15.460
All right. So then I do my best to get to the closest enemy and try to... And I'll just keep

01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:22.260
way on punching them if I make it. Okay. You do that. Hell yeah. So you're punching... Which guy?

01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:26.340
Whoever's closest. Who's the guy? The... Yeah, the crippled guy's closest. I'm just gonna...

01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:31.940
Yeah. Just keep punching him while he's down until his face is all bloody and like his bones

01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:38.260
start cracking. What's your strength bonus? 18 plus four. That's a lot of... You hit him for five

01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:43.220
damage. Fuck yeah. All right. You knock him out. Eat my shit, you bitch.

01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:53.060
Eat my shit. You... That could be. Yeah. Moment pass. Who's turn? Jeff's turn. Can I... Can I

01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:57.940
do a firebolt as a tree or am I just a tree? No, you gotta come back from a tree to not entangle.

01:57:58.660 --> 01:58:05.540
Is that one turn? Let's see. You can do it as a free action. Okay. Free action. I untree.

01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:12.740
And I shoot firebolt at crippled guy. Okay. Wait. He just got knocked out. Oh yeah. Fuck

01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:22.180
him. I'm gonna kill him. Okay. You missed. Jesus Christ. It's all right guys. I've been a tree for the last 10 minutes.

01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:30.820
Yeah. Shambling mount. I... I run up to the crippled guy that's unconscious. I start stomping on him

01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:39.060
like De Niro and Goodfellas. Okay. When he's stomping on the the shinebox guy. So the camera's

01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:46.820
like looking up at you. Up at me and I'm going. It's gross. It makes you uncomfortable. It makes

01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:51.300
a lot of people make that mistake. That character's name isn't the shinebox guy. He's dead.

01:58:56.980 --> 01:59:00.020
He's dead. Gary, you killed him.

01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:14.580
Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you. Thank you Jesus Christ in heaven. Thank you. Thank you Saint Peter.

01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:21.220
Who are these people he's talking about? Thank you Jesus. I don't know. What was that?

01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:32.580
Clefanger. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. The most fitting ending to an episode ever.

01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:37.620
Give it up for Steve. Leave it everybody. The best episode. The most fitting ending.

01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:49.300
It's a trap. Man. This ended an episode in silence. Yeah. Not even mid like. The credits weren't

01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:57.220
even rolling. It was just kind of like. Should we cut? Should we cut? Okay. Let's give it up for

01:59:57.220 --> 02:00:03.300
everybody that helps make this awesome. You sang Sarah, Kevin, Chris, Zach, Church.

02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:08.260
Tim Morge is here somewhere. Wasn't Tim Morge supposed to be on the show? Is he just hanging

02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:16.900
up? Have I forgotten anybody? Oh, especially Quinten in the Game Master. I'm the Comptroller,

02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:26.900
Mr. Jeff Davis, your mayor is Dan Harmon. Try fast. Take chances.

02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:44.900
Did you get any of that? It's a good show.
