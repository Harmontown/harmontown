{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n08:48.000 --> 09:15.860\nHello, New York!\n\n09:15.860 --> 09:22.920\nWelcome to the Fabulous Gramercy Theater in downtown Greenwich, Upper East Greenwich.\n\n09:22.920 --> 09:28.360\nIt's Harmontown is now in session.\n\n09:28.360 --> 09:33.280\nLet's bring to the stage Spencer Crittenden.\n\n09:33.280 --> 09:42.200\nHey guys!\n\n09:42.200 --> 09:45.120\nOh shit.\n\n09:45.120 --> 09:48.840\nWe're in the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n09:48.840 --> 09:49.840\nDan Harmon.\n\n09:49.840 --> 09:50.840\nThank you, New York!\n\n09:50.840 --> 09:51.840\nThank you!\n\n09:51.840 --> 09:52.840\nOh yeah.\n\n09:52.840 --> 09:53.840\nYeah, we did a little experimental thing.\n\n09:53.840 --> 09:54.840\nI did some taping before the show.\n\n09:54.840 --> 09:55.840\nIs this the place where we did that the first time?\n\n09:55.840 --> 09:56.840\nNo.\n\n09:56.840 --> 10:10.080\nThat was Canada, where everything is an experiment.\n\n10:10.080 --> 10:12.960\nThank you, lights.\n\n10:12.960 --> 10:13.960\nThank you so much.\n\n10:13.960 --> 10:18.960\nYou know, what do you call it, your circadian schedule, is that what it's called?\n\n10:18.960 --> 10:19.960\nYour circadian...\n\n10:19.960 --> 10:20.960\nRhythm.\n\n10:20.960 --> 10:29.280\nYou know, the sine wave of your circadian ups and downs.\n\n10:29.280 --> 10:30.880\nOh, rhythm.\n\n10:30.880 --> 10:33.720\nI'll look it up later.\n\n10:33.720 --> 10:39.600\nIt's probably telling you that nothing is interesting or funny, or if you're drunk,\n\n10:39.600 --> 10:44.120\nthat there's something wrong with you, you know, I can't combat that.\n\n10:44.120 --> 10:45.720\nRight, we're doing our jobs.\n\n10:45.720 --> 10:48.000\nYou guys got to step up.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:52.800\nBut I did, because I thought, okay, so I wait.\n\n10:52.800 --> 10:54.080\nI mean, you don't have to wait.\n\n10:54.080 --> 10:55.080\nYou are waiting.\n\n10:55.080 --> 10:56.080\nYou're an audience.\n\n10:56.080 --> 10:57.080\nThat's what you do.\n\n10:57.080 --> 10:59.080\nI don't have to tell you to wait.\n\n10:59.080 --> 11:01.000\nSorry, I'm sorry.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:05.840\nI made like a...on the way here in the cab, I made a PowerPoint.\n\n11:05.840 --> 11:15.840\nWait, okay, Levy said I was here somewhere.\n\n11:15.840 --> 11:19.840\nLevy, is it...is it...\n\n11:19.840 --> 11:24.840\nOh, it's in preview.\n\n11:24.840 --> 11:25.840\nOkay.\n\n11:25.840 --> 11:28.400\nYou have open emu on that thing?\n\n11:28.400 --> 11:29.400\nWe should play Mario.\n\n11:29.400 --> 11:30.400\nOh, there it is.\n\n11:30.400 --> 11:31.400\nOkay.\n\n11:31.400 --> 11:35.200\nWait, I can...I think you just...okay.\n\n11:35.200 --> 11:36.200\nOkay.\n\n11:36.200 --> 11:39.200\nAll right.\n\n11:39.200 --> 11:41.200\nSteve Levy, everybody.\n\n11:41.200 --> 11:43.200\nYes, yes.\n\n11:43.200 --> 11:44.200\nAll right.\n\n11:44.200 --> 11:49.040\nMy presentation for those of you who are later listening and who didn't pay a million dollars,\n\n11:49.040 --> 11:54.440\nso who cares about your needs, but for those of you who are listening, this slide show\n\n11:54.440 --> 11:57.840\nis called New York Show, Why It Will Be Great.\n\n11:57.840 --> 11:58.920\nThat's the first slide.\n\n11:58.920 --> 12:05.120\nAnd then...okay, what...all right, all right, it's not really...okay.\n\n12:05.120 --> 12:13.320\nI don't know if...I didn't expect it to be this bad.\n\n12:13.320 --> 12:18.080\nIt's supposed to still be able to like be a slide show, but they're just scrolling through\n\n12:18.080 --> 12:21.680\nlike a papyrus on screen.\n\n12:21.680 --> 12:22.680\nWhat is a show?\n\n12:22.680 --> 12:27.680\nA show is entertainment, success, connection, and there's a boat because it's a...\n\n12:27.680 --> 12:30.200\nWhy was that boat all wrinkly?\n\n12:30.200 --> 12:34.000\nThis is a...there's a quote slide with Johnny Appleseed's type quote here.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:41.000\nOkay, so New York and Deanna Harmon are urban, but see the thing is these are supposed to\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:49.000\nbe slides, so then it's...\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:53.600\nThen it would appear that the word uncompromising appeared underneath or at urban, but instead\n\n12:53.600 --> 12:56.120\nit's just scrolling through.\n\n12:56.120 --> 13:03.560\nAlso, my first name's in all caps because the phone knows me that way, and it's...where\n\n13:03.560 --> 13:14.200\nof...we're urban, we're uncompromising, we're offended by 9-11, very much so, to the core,\n\n13:14.200 --> 13:19.240\nand we're efficient, but there's a triangle I couldn't get rid of.\n\n13:19.240 --> 13:26.360\nNew York and Deanna Harmon are okay looking from a distance, but less so during the day.\n\n13:26.360 --> 13:33.400\nWe are...we're up close, parts of us are beautiful, parts of us are scary and smell like pee.\n\n13:33.400 --> 13:37.080\nNew York and Deanna Harmon, you can tell what we just ate by looking at the ground around\n\n13:37.080 --> 13:44.000\nus, except in the case of me, that's like regular food, and New York just...they eat dreams.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.480\nIt eats dreams.\n\n13:45.480 --> 13:47.520\nThis is New York City, not a New Yorker.\n\n13:47.520 --> 13:48.520\nBoy, Harmon.\n\n13:48.520 --> 13:49.520\nOh, what?\n\n13:49.520 --> 13:50.520\nOkay, what?\n\n13:50.520 --> 13:51.520\nWait, wait.\n\n13:51.520 --> 13:52.520\nOh no.\n\n13:52.520 --> 13:53.520\nIs that it?\n\n13:53.520 --> 13:54.520\nThat's the whole thing?\n\n13:54.520 --> 13:55.520\nYeah, I guess so.\n\n13:55.520 --> 13:56.520\nIt loops.\n\n13:56.520 --> 13:57.520\nI didn't know they loop.\n\n13:57.520 --> 13:58.520\nYeah.\n\n13:58.520 --> 14:14.520\nAll right, also I...you know, okay, all right, later on, maybe we'll...I wish I could type\n\n14:14.520 --> 14:15.520\nbetter.\n\n14:15.520 --> 14:17.520\nOh, now that works.\n\n14:17.520 --> 14:18.520\nOkay.\n\n14:18.520 --> 14:22.520\nAll right, so we have some people we could meet too, but only if I'm really...well, we\n\n14:22.520 --> 14:26.520\nhave one person we're going to meet no matter what, and then another person if I'm like\n\n14:26.520 --> 14:28.520\ndrowning.\n\n14:28.520 --> 14:30.080\nOh, that's not very nice.\n\n14:30.080 --> 14:32.080\nNow they'll have to figure out which is which.\n\n14:32.080 --> 14:35.040\nNo, the first person is the person I'd like you to meet.\n\n14:35.040 --> 14:39.160\nThe second person, if I bring them up, you know that that person is like somebody that\n\n14:39.160 --> 14:40.920\nI'm like, we're drowning.\n\n14:40.920 --> 14:41.920\nYeah.\n\n14:41.920 --> 14:45.000\nAnd then they have to know that, but they can use that.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:46.800\nThey can be self-effacing about that.\n\n14:46.800 --> 14:50.520\nYeah, I'm sure they'll use that to their advantage.\n\n14:50.520 --> 14:51.520\nYeah.\n\n14:51.520 --> 14:55.520\nI have some things that...okay, hold on a second.\n\n14:55.520 --> 15:05.520\nSpatially, this is a lot more complicated than we're used to.\n\n15:05.520 --> 15:06.520\nYeah.\n\n15:06.520 --> 15:07.520\nA lot of maneuvering.\n\n15:07.520 --> 15:09.520\nHow are you enjoying this trip to New York?\n\n15:09.520 --> 15:10.520\nOh, I hate it.\n\n15:10.520 --> 15:13.300\nI'm in deadline hell right now.\n\n15:13.300 --> 15:17.120\nAfter this, I am sure to go back to continue working on the thing that we're supposed to\n\n15:17.120 --> 15:18.120\nshoot in a week.\n\n15:18.120 --> 15:19.120\nOh.\n\n15:19.120 --> 15:23.160\nBut our second guest, if we're drowning, is our boss from CISO, so you could probably\n\n15:23.160 --> 15:24.160\njust...\n\n15:24.160 --> 15:25.160\nAsk him.\n\n15:25.160 --> 15:26.160\nOkay, the show.\n\n15:26.160 --> 15:27.160\nYeah.\n\n15:27.160 --> 15:28.160\nA week.\n\n15:28.160 --> 15:29.160\nI hope we drown.\n\n15:29.160 --> 15:34.360\nBecause also, I hope this show doesn't go that well.\n\n15:34.360 --> 15:44.140\nYou're talking about a Harmon quest second season is what you're talking about?\n\n15:44.140 --> 15:49.960\nSome updates just, if you are a Cookie Collector II person that has joined my Cookie Collector\n\n15:49.960 --> 15:53.520\nII team, I didn't know there was no way to kick people off.\n\n15:53.520 --> 15:55.760\na lot of you, there can only be 50 people.\n\n15:55.760 --> 15:57.360\nThere's a lot of freeloaders on your team.\n\n15:57.360 --> 16:01.640\nI don't know if you can figure out a way to leave the team, but if you could, if you've\n\n16:01.640 --> 16:05.280\ncollected literally zero cookies, that's not how you play Cookie Collector 2.\n\n16:05.280 --> 16:07.480\nTo lead your camp.\n\n16:07.480 --> 16:12.000\nIt's not, I'm not an elitist, I'm not saying you gotta work hard and play hard and you\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:13.000\nknow.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:14.000\nIt's called Cookie Collector.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:15.000\nIt's called Cookie Collector.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:19.600\nA lot of you, like 47 of you are taking up 47 of 50 slots and you're collecting zero\n\n16:19.600 --> 16:20.600\ncookies.\n\n16:20.600 --> 16:23.240\nYou can't rumble crumbs that way.\n\n16:23.240 --> 16:27.000\nBut I'd also like to say the reason I don't appear to be collecting a lot of cookies right\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.240\nnow is because I'm building up bonuses.\n\n16:29.240 --> 16:30.640\nI keep prestigeing.\n\n16:30.640 --> 16:31.640\nOkay.\n\n16:31.640 --> 16:37.920\nAll right, so what if that's what they're all doing, though?\n\n16:37.920 --> 16:40.520\nBut you know, you can't do that without collecting.\n\n16:40.520 --> 16:42.000\nThese people have collected zero cookies.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.800\nOkay, I don't know the game.\n\n16:44.800 --> 16:49.960\nDr. Henry Lee, a world famous forensic scientist.\n\n16:49.960 --> 16:51.960\nSo this crazy thing happened.\n\n16:51.960 --> 16:52.960\nWhere is he based?\n\n16:52.960 --> 16:53.960\nHe lives in California.\n\n16:53.960 --> 16:54.960\nWe have to get him on the show.\n\n16:54.960 --> 16:56.600\nDr. Henry Lee is amazing.\n\n16:56.600 --> 17:03.560\nThere's a forensic files marathon happening right now on the television.\n\n17:03.560 --> 17:08.400\nAnd like Cody, Cody recorded him saying the same thing.\n\n17:08.400 --> 17:09.400\nShe didn't have Tivo.\n\n17:09.400 --> 17:10.400\nShe wasn't able to freeze it.\n\n17:10.400 --> 17:11.480\nIt was just like a weird coincidence.\n\n17:11.480 --> 17:15.120\nWe were like sharing the, you know, him and the JonBenét Ramsey thing.\n\n17:15.120 --> 17:18.640\nHe's like, don't steal my papal.\n\n17:18.640 --> 17:23.600\nAnd then it's like, are you allowed to have fun with the fact that a guy speaks very, very\n\n17:23.600 --> 17:24.600\nbroken English?\n\n17:24.600 --> 17:28.160\nIt's like, that ties into like, you know, it's like, are those days over?\n\n17:28.160 --> 17:32.040\nI don't know if New York City understands that concept.\n\n17:32.040 --> 17:34.240\nIt's like, where does it bleed into racism?\n\n17:34.240 --> 17:39.840\nI think the guy's English is very, very funny, and that's linked to whatever.\n\n17:39.840 --> 17:42.040\nHe talks funny.\n\n17:42.040 --> 17:43.040\nBut he can handle it.\n\n17:43.040 --> 17:44.040\nHe's very, very smart.\n\n17:44.040 --> 17:51.240\nAnd he's just like, he speaks such funny English, and because of his job, he has to talk about\n\n17:51.240 --> 17:52.880\nthe grossest shit.\n\n17:52.880 --> 17:59.760\nAnd so Cody saw this clip, and she taped it, and it was, Dr. Henry Lee, there was like\n\n17:59.760 --> 18:06.520\na UV ray going over a bed, and there was just all this shit lighting up, and Dr. Henry\n\n18:06.520 --> 18:19.000\nLee says, we found between 150 and 200 individual seamy stains.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:23.760\nThat's a lot of seamy stain.\n\n18:23.760 --> 18:25.240\nI was just watching over and over again.\n\n18:25.240 --> 18:28.120\nThen we checked into our hotel, and we turned down the forensic files, Marathon, and the\n\n18:28.120 --> 18:29.360\nsame thing was playing.\n\n18:29.360 --> 18:35.520\nAnd we were, oh my God, the same thing happened to me, but with drivers, dinos, and dives.\n\n18:35.520 --> 18:37.240\nOh shit.\n\n18:37.240 --> 18:38.960\nWhat's drivers, diamonds, and dives?\n\n18:38.960 --> 18:39.960\nWell, let's move on.\n\n18:39.960 --> 18:40.960\nIt's fine.\n\n18:40.960 --> 18:46.160\nIs there a show about cars that go into the ocean and the people that rescue their treasures?\n\n18:46.160 --> 18:47.160\nYeah.\n\n18:47.160 --> 18:50.400\nPosted by Guy Fieri.\n\n18:50.400 --> 18:59.080\nAnyways, that is a lot of seamy stain, but I thought it was interesting that he had sort\n\n18:59.080 --> 19:01.440\nof a sympathy for the devil kind of delivery on that.\n\n19:01.440 --> 19:02.960\nHe's like, that's a lot of seamy stain.\n\n19:02.960 --> 19:08.000\nAnd then it cut to a different thing, and I think what he said next is like, but, you\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.040\nknow, or maybe he said, and I should know.\n\n19:11.040 --> 19:15.600\nI thought it sounded like sympathy for the bed, right?\n\n19:15.600 --> 19:22.000\nI thought it was more like, I thought he was saying, that's a lot of seamy stain, but that\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:26.360\nalone does not make man a bad person.\n\n19:26.360 --> 19:29.240\nSpecial people generate seamy.\n\n19:29.240 --> 19:30.800\nYou may be bad person.\n\n19:30.800 --> 19:33.840\nYou may be forensic genius.\n\n19:33.840 --> 19:36.920\nMaybe that make you make more semen.\n\n19:36.920 --> 19:40.560\nI don't know.\n\n19:40.560 --> 19:42.480\nCody killed her first fly today.\n\n19:42.480 --> 19:43.480\nWhat?\n\n19:43.480 --> 19:44.480\nWhich I, no, no, no.\n\n19:44.480 --> 19:45.720\nDid she not like killing bugs?\n\n19:45.720 --> 19:46.720\nNo, it wasn't that.\n\n19:46.720 --> 19:47.720\nThat's what I thought.\n\n19:47.720 --> 19:48.720\nBut she's just bad at it.\n\n19:48.720 --> 19:51.200\nShe's never got, she's never gotten a kill.\n\n19:51.200 --> 19:55.960\nThere was a giant fly in the hotel bathroom, and she, she was relaying this all to me.\n\n19:55.960 --> 19:56.960\nI wasn't there.\n\n19:56.960 --> 19:59.120\nShe, she, she injured it with a towel.\n\n19:59.120 --> 20:00.120\nNice.\n\n20:00.120 --> 20:01.120\nShe went into a crevice.\n\n20:01.120 --> 20:02.120\nA good start.\n\n20:02.120 --> 20:04.600\nAnd she, she, so she sprayed it with hairspray.\n\n20:04.600 --> 20:05.600\nAlso nice.\n\n20:05.600 --> 20:07.760\nUntil it crawled out of the crevice.\n\n20:07.760 --> 20:08.760\nRight.\n\n20:08.760 --> 20:09.760\nDizzy.\n\n20:09.760 --> 20:10.760\nAnd gummed up.\n\n20:10.760 --> 20:11.760\nFrom this great hair.\n\n20:11.760 --> 20:13.160\nAnd, and then she finally smushed it.\n\n20:13.160 --> 20:16.760\nAnd it just made me think, can you imagine, because flies, they literally correct me if\n\n20:16.760 --> 20:17.760\nI'm wrong.\n\n20:17.760 --> 20:21.000\nThe common house fly, its lifespan is one day, right?\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.160\nI doubt it.\n\n20:22.160 --> 20:23.160\nThat's not true.\n\n20:23.160 --> 20:24.160\nI don't think so.\n\n20:24.160 --> 20:25.160\nMaybe.\n\n20:25.160 --> 20:29.200\nDo we have an armchair entomologist down here that said no?\n\n20:29.200 --> 20:30.200\nOkay.\n\n20:30.200 --> 20:34.800\nWell, who, flies in like swamps live a day, someone said.\n\n20:34.800 --> 20:38.240\nWell, gnats surely, but flies are bigger than gnats.\n\n20:38.240 --> 20:39.680\nI thought they live a day.\n\n20:39.680 --> 20:40.880\nWho thinks they know better?\n\n20:40.880 --> 20:42.680\nI'm sure some flies live a day, Dan.\n\n20:42.680 --> 20:43.680\nYeah.\n\n20:43.680 --> 20:46.640\nNobody's really willing to, we got a, we got a very delicate hand coming up.\n\n20:46.640 --> 20:48.480\nNot, I'm not, that's not, you're not a delicate person.\n\n20:48.480 --> 20:51.560\nI'm not saying, I'm saying your hand is delicate, sir.\n\n20:51.560 --> 20:57.680\nUh, saying it was a furtive, furtive.\n\n20:57.680 --> 20:58.680\nThank you.\n\n20:58.680 --> 21:00.200\nThey live a day as adults.\n\n21:00.200 --> 21:01.200\nThey live longer as maggots.\n\n21:01.200 --> 21:02.200\nI see.\n\n21:02.200 --> 21:03.200\nI don't know about that either.\n\n21:03.200 --> 21:04.200\nAll right.\n\n21:04.200 --> 21:05.200\nWell.\n\n21:05.200 --> 21:11.000\nI'm just going to call bullshit on anything anyone says from here on out.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:14.280\nThis is a very risky thing for me to do, but it would probably happen if I didn't call\n\n21:14.280 --> 21:15.360\nfor it.\n\n21:15.360 --> 21:20.720\nBut if anybody were to find out, well, I heard someone yell out 28 days.\n\n21:20.720 --> 21:21.720\n28 days?\n\n21:21.720 --> 21:22.720\nWow.\n\n21:22.720 --> 21:23.720\nLater.\n\n21:23.720 --> 21:24.720\nThat's a lot of semestand.\n\n21:24.720 --> 21:25.720\nOkay.\n\n21:25.720 --> 21:26.720\n28 days.\n\n21:26.720 --> 21:27.720\nOkay.\n\n21:27.720 --> 21:28.720\nOkay.\n\n21:28.720 --> 21:29.720\nSo never mind.\n\n21:29.720 --> 21:30.720\nWell, what were you going to say?\n\n21:30.720 --> 21:34.040\nWell, I was just like, these things live for a day and then like some of them get to live\n\n21:34.040 --> 21:39.280\nlike the perfect life because it's like there's turds everywhere and they love them.\n\n21:39.280 --> 21:43.400\nAnd it's like, like, and then I was thinking like so many of them just live in our definition\n\n21:43.400 --> 21:47.200\nof hell, like, like, like, because they are born and then they're probably like an hour\n\n21:47.200 --> 21:51.600\ninto their life and then, and then they probably spend, then then somebody's just trying to\n\n21:51.600 --> 21:55.040\nswat them the whole time and they're like, can I just please eat a little bit of that\n\n21:55.040 --> 21:59.440\ndried milk off that picnic table and, and then there, or there's like a horse tail is\n\n21:59.440 --> 22:03.600\nlike constantly trying to kill them and their family and I don't know.\n\n22:03.600 --> 22:06.040\nBut 28 days, they should, they should figure it out.\n\n22:06.040 --> 22:07.040\nOh, they should.\n\n22:07.040 --> 22:08.760\nFly is about it too easy for too long.\n\n22:08.760 --> 22:15.120\nThey have time to like build a fly house and they could, if they, if they, if they're,\n\n22:15.120 --> 22:19.840\nyeah, we don't, they don't deserve our sympathy insects because they, they're like the first\n\n22:19.840 --> 22:22.840\ntype of organism, the first phylum.\n\n22:22.840 --> 22:23.840\nNo.\n\n22:23.840 --> 22:24.840\nFirst kingdom.\n\n22:24.840 --> 22:25.840\nKingdom maybe.\n\n22:25.840 --> 22:26.840\nNo.\n\n22:26.840 --> 22:27.840\nKingdoms are animal and.\n\n22:27.840 --> 22:28.840\nOh, yeah.\n\n22:28.840 --> 22:29.840\nAnimal, kingdom, phylum.\n\n22:29.840 --> 22:33.520\nThe first phylum to like, you know, start nailing it as far as organization because\n\n22:33.520 --> 22:38.440\nthey're multicellular organisms that then got meta and fractal about it and said, what\n\n22:38.440 --> 22:44.200\nif these multicellular individuals worked in a colony and were social and stuff.\n\n22:44.200 --> 22:47.280\nAnd so they've kind of perfected everything and then they got lazy and they were just\n\n22:47.280 --> 22:51.320\nlike, well, it's not like, it's not like we're going to turn into lizards and then squirrels\n\n22:51.320 --> 22:55.200\nand then monkeys and then the monkeys are going to like hit a gazelle with a femur bone and\n\n22:55.200 --> 22:56.840\nmake spaceships.\n\n22:56.840 --> 23:02.840\nBut they were wrong and they've, and they fucking, now they, now they can eat our shit.\n\n23:02.840 --> 23:03.840\nAnd they're like, we love your shit.\n\n23:03.840 --> 23:05.600\nAnd I'm like, yeah, protest more.\n\n23:05.600 --> 23:08.480\nThat's how Planet of the Apes happened, right?\n\n23:08.480 --> 23:09.480\nJust a reminder.\n\n23:09.480 --> 23:10.600\nSo, okay, hold on.\n\n23:10.600 --> 23:15.760\nWith these bugs though, I always assume that bugs just like we're little windup toys, right?\n\n23:15.760 --> 23:17.840\nBut people feel bad about killing bugs.\n\n23:17.840 --> 23:19.080\nLike what's the consensus?\n\n23:19.080 --> 23:21.080\nDoes, does PETA, how does, where does PETA stand?\n\n23:21.080 --> 23:23.680\nI don't care what PETA stands for.\n\n23:23.680 --> 23:27.120\nThat's a good way to get your, some, you blown up.\n\n23:27.120 --> 23:29.840\nYou know, well, you heard about this PETA thing, right?\n\n23:29.840 --> 23:32.760\nAbout this, this new ad campaign that I was talking about.\n\n23:32.760 --> 23:33.760\nWell, they have the women's aid.\n\n23:33.760 --> 23:36.760\nI was held down and I was violated and they go, surprise, I'm speaking for cows.\n\n23:36.760 --> 23:37.760\nFor cows, yeah.\n\n23:37.760 --> 23:38.760\nYeah.\n\n23:38.760 --> 23:44.520\nThere were people, I saw people's reactions to that included, like I saw somebody on Twitter\n\n23:44.520 --> 23:50.120\nbeing like, this is over the line, PETA needs to be shut down.\n\n23:50.120 --> 23:51.120\nThat's the problem.\n\n23:51.120 --> 23:52.120\nThat is our problem.\n\n23:52.120 --> 23:56.040\nLike that's why our country is like, like suffering because of people that, it's not because\n\n23:56.040 --> 24:01.920\nof all the shit that's going on, it's because we have successfully systematized the infantilization\n\n24:01.920 --> 24:06.440\nof, of, of us, of ourselves as a biomass where there are like second or third generation\n\n24:06.440 --> 24:09.160\nof people that are just like, that's offensive.\n\n24:09.160 --> 24:11.240\nSomebody's going to deal with that for sure.\n\n24:11.240 --> 24:15.120\nLike, like, like the teacher's not going to put up with that obnoxious person.\n\n24:15.120 --> 24:17.120\nAs for me, I'll be over here getting straight A's.\n\n24:17.120 --> 24:21.040\nNo, you're going to be over here sliding into the ocean and there may be a Nazi elected\n\n24:21.040 --> 24:22.040\nin a day.\n\n24:22.040 --> 24:26.520\nLike, like, like, like, and I'm not, I'm not, I'm just saying like, we, we have like\n\n24:26.520 --> 24:27.520\nthat noise.\n\n24:27.520 --> 24:31.740\nLike I get, I get where it's coming from, but just specifically the quality of the sound\n\n24:31.740 --> 24:33.240\nof that noise was very weird.\n\n24:33.240 --> 24:37.660\nWell, because I think like someone said, Zuzza, Zuzza, Zuzza, Zuzza.\n\n24:37.660 --> 24:42.160\nI am on that person's side because that is, I'm not, I'm not against them.\n\n24:42.160 --> 24:44.200\nI just, I do, I want to understand.\n\n24:44.200 --> 24:45.400\nI'm here to grow.\n\n24:45.400 --> 24:52.320\nThat's the Dairy Queen Parfait of, of, stop saying he might get elected.\n\n24:52.320 --> 24:58.200\nAnd even if he doesn't, what the fuck are we going to do, like, like, and maybe I'm\n\n24:58.200 --> 25:02.400\non the alt right in a Harmontown fan, I don't know.\n\n25:02.400 --> 25:03.400\nYeah.\n\n25:03.400 --> 25:05.320\nYou've certainly courted them heavily.\n\n25:05.320 --> 25:10.520\nWell, that, that Vice-Canada clip that they, they've certainly made me look like an undecided\n\n25:10.520 --> 25:11.520\nvoter.\n\n25:11.520 --> 25:12.520\nNice.\n\n25:12.520 --> 25:13.520\nAll I'm saying is everyone's full of shit.\n\n25:13.520 --> 25:24.120\nI'm not saying don't go out and stop this guy from hitlering.\n\n25:24.120 --> 25:26.840\nHe's from, he's, he's from New York.\n\n25:26.840 --> 25:27.840\nHe's a New York tradition.\n\n25:27.840 --> 25:28.840\nWell, isn't...\n\n25:28.840 --> 25:30.840\nI know, I know how you feel.\n\n25:30.840 --> 25:35.720\nLike, I, like, I, I, I feel like New Yorkers have been, have been like, like, like sick\n\n25:35.720 --> 25:42.160\nof that guy for 35 years, and like, and we're, and we're like, and we're like marveling at\n\n25:42.160 --> 25:45.760\nwhen, when the celebrity apprentice happened, like, who in Wichita thought this was a good\n\n25:45.760 --> 25:46.760\nidea?\n\n25:46.760 --> 25:47.760\nYeah.\n\n25:47.760 --> 25:51.920\nBut, but anyways, we don't want to talk about that.\n\n25:51.920 --> 25:55.920\nWe don't have anything else to talk about, but we've just, we've all been hit over the\n\n25:55.920 --> 25:59.680\nhead with a sack of potatoes for a year and a half now.\n\n25:59.680 --> 26:01.080\nThis election's been going on.\n\n26:01.080 --> 26:02.080\nThat's the new thing.\n\n26:02.080 --> 26:03.680\nThat's, that's what we got going on.\n\n26:03.680 --> 26:07.520\nAnd we all know nothing's gonna, like, like, like the problem obviously isn't the election.\n\n26:07.520 --> 26:09.360\nIt's, because the president's got one power.\n\n26:09.360 --> 26:12.920\nI flipped out on Twitter recently because the one thing is the Supreme Court thing.\n\n26:12.920 --> 26:17.280\nThat is why that's, because the president, during their term, if any of these geezers\n\n26:17.280 --> 26:21.840\nlike kicks it, like, they, they replace them and they replace them along these party lines.\n\n26:21.840 --> 26:24.840\nAnd it's one thing, it's already bad enough that we have this bipartisan system where\n\n26:24.840 --> 26:30.880\nthese guys are just playing human chess and, and ladies playing human chess, congratulations.\n\n26:30.880 --> 26:35.360\nBut, but, but it's like, and then it did, now it's just like, they're just like five\n\n26:35.360 --> 26:38.080\nyear olds and they're fucking with the thing, well, we're not gonna let you be here, you\n\n26:38.080 --> 26:41.520\nknow, this is fucking unconstitutional, I'm gonna fucking kill myself, I'm gonna kill,\n\n26:41.520 --> 26:42.520\nI'm gonna kill myself.\n\n26:42.520 --> 26:46.040\nIt's the only thing that's legal to say anymore, I'm gonna kill myself.\n\n26:46.040 --> 26:47.040\nThat's the thing.\n\n26:47.040 --> 26:50.360\nI'm gonna kill all of you, I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill myself.\n\n26:50.360 --> 26:51.360\nCan't say that.\n\n26:51.360 --> 26:54.360\nThat's code, I'm gonna kill you.\n\n26:54.360 --> 27:00.160\nI'm gonna live forever, every time I kill you, I'm gonna gain power like Highlander.\n\n27:00.160 --> 27:04.800\nAnd then I'll be able to, it's like a, it's like well water in my head, but I can sense\n\n27:04.800 --> 27:05.800\nthoughts.\n\n27:05.800 --> 27:07.040\nWhat are you gonna do in Highlander too?\n\n27:07.040 --> 27:13.120\nI'm gonna make an ozone shield, what?\n\n27:13.120 --> 27:18.120\nThat Highlander series, I'll tell you, they did not know what we wanted in a Highlander\n\n27:18.120 --> 27:23.080\ntoo, but there, I'm sure the writers sat down and were like, well it says there can only\n\n27:23.080 --> 27:31.840\nbe one, and then there's one at the end, shit, pretty cool, they're from Mars, I don't know.\n\n27:31.840 --> 27:39.800\nOur next guest is new to the Feral Audio Podcast family, and I know barely anything about her,\n\n27:39.800 --> 27:43.160\nbut I thought it would be a good chance to get to know her because she was in town.\n\n27:43.160 --> 27:47.760\nPlease welcome Mary Hoolahan.\n\n27:47.760 --> 27:49.760\nHey.\n\n27:49.760 --> 27:51.760\nHello.\n\n27:51.760 --> 28:03.120\nAll right, so, if the show's bad, it's your fault.\n\n28:03.120

what are the tickets?\n\n29:21.360 --> 29:22.360\n$90?\n\n29:22.360 --> 29:23.360\n$700?\n\n29:23.360 --> 29:24.360\nWhat are they?\n\n29:24.360 --> 29:25.360\n$700, I think.\n\n29:25.360 --> 29:26.360\n$700?\n\n29:26.360 --> 29:27.360\nYeah.\n\n29:27.360 --> 29:28.360\nYou know how that breaks down?\n\n29:28.360 --> 29:29.360\nLike, the Spencer...\n\n29:29.360 --> 29:30.360\nSpencer's beard has to be fertilized.\n\n29:30.360 --> 29:32.360\nIt has to be flown in.\n\n29:32.360 --> 29:33.360\nUh...\n\n29:33.360 --> 29:34.360\nPeople have to fly out.\n\n29:34.360 --> 29:35.360\nI'm first class.\n\n29:35.360 --> 29:36.360\nI can't...\n\n29:36.360 --> 29:38.360\nI need my mint.\n\n29:38.360 --> 29:39.360\nMy mint service.\n\n29:39.360 --> 29:41.360\nMy signature mint drink.\n\n29:41.360 --> 29:45.360\nUm, anyways, New Jersey.\n\n29:45.360 --> 29:47.360\nThanks for making the drive.\n\n29:47.360 --> 29:48.360\nUh...\n\n29:48.360 --> 29:51.360\nSo, uh, tell us about, uh, New Media.\n\n29:51.360 --> 29:53.360\nOh, my God.\n\n29:53.360 --> 29:56.360\nThere's so much media out there.\n\n29:56.360 --> 29:58.360\nNot enough time, honestly.\n\n29:58.360 --> 29:59.360\nYeah, no.\n\n29:59.360 --> 30:01.360\nEverybody can't watch everything anymore.\n\n30:01.360 --> 30:02.360\nYeah, it's sad.\n\n30:02.360 --> 30:05.360\nWhen I was your age, you could watch everything.\n\n30:05.360 --> 30:10.360\nAnd, uh, and they're at the end of the night, around midnight, they would literally play\n\n30:10.360 --> 30:14.360\nthe national anthem and show a flag.\n\n30:14.360 --> 30:16.360\nAnd it would go to static.\n\n30:16.360 --> 30:18.360\nThere wasn't enough TV.\n\n30:18.360 --> 30:19.360\nIt was insane.\n\n30:19.360 --> 30:23.360\nAnd people would just, like, die in their chairs, smoking cigarettes, watching.\n\n30:23.360 --> 30:24.360\nStatic.\n\n30:24.360 --> 30:27.360\nThat's, uh, the original Poltergeist movie is all based on that.\n\n30:27.360 --> 30:31.360\nIt's like, oh, that's, that's when the ghosts come out of your TV.\n\n30:31.360 --> 30:32.360\nLike, because we had nothing.\n\n30:32.360 --> 30:34.360\nLike, Spielberg was like, now what?\n\n30:34.360 --> 30:35.360\nAnd it's like flipping channels.\n\n30:35.360 --> 30:39.360\nHe's like, what if a ghost was there?\n\n30:39.360 --> 30:42.360\nThere's not going to be any more Spielbergs, because now there's too much to watch.\n\n30:42.360 --> 30:43.360\nYeah.\n\n30:43.360 --> 30:46.360\nAnd Spielberg is like hooked on, uh, the fall.\n\n30:46.360 --> 30:47.360\nYeah.\n\n30:47.360 --> 30:48.360\nNetflix.\n\n30:48.360 --> 30:49.360\nYou watch the fall?\n\n30:49.360 --> 30:50.360\nSo awesome.\n\n30:50.360 --> 30:51.360\nReally?\n\n30:51.360 --> 30:52.360\nJillian Anderson.\n\n30:52.360 --> 30:54.360\nOh, she's in rare form.\n\n30:54.360 --> 30:57.360\nYeah, British.\n\n30:57.360 --> 30:59.360\nMy favorite form.\n\n30:59.360 --> 31:01.360\nShe's doing, like, an accent.\n\n31:01.360 --> 31:03.360\nOr, or, or she was British the whole time.\n\n31:03.360 --> 31:04.360\nYeah, she's British.\n\n31:04.360 --> 31:06.360\nI, in either case, she's impressive.\n\n31:06.360 --> 31:11.360\nUh, I don't understand how people can act in an accent.\n\n31:11.360 --> 31:14.360\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n31:14.360 --> 31:17.360\nUh, well, give, uh, give me a, give me an accent.\n\n31:17.360 --> 31:18.360\nIrish.\n\n31:18.360 --> 31:19.360\nIrish.\n\n31:19.360 --> 31:20.360\nAnd, uh, give me a, uh,\n\n31:20.360 --> 31:21.360\nJerry Seinfeld.\n\n31:21.360 --> 31:32.360\nDid you have her notice?\n\n31:32.360 --> 31:34.360\nWhat's with Shalili's?\n\n31:34.360 --> 31:38.360\nThat doesn't sound like something I'd hit you with.\n\n31:38.360 --> 31:43.360\nIf you're going to hit someone with something, call it a hitter.\n\n31:43.360 --> 31:45.360\nDon't call it something's delightful.\n\n31:45.360 --> 31:49.360\nOh, I'm going to pull out my Shalili.\n\n31:49.360 --> 31:52.360\nOkay, now this time you're upset with your wife.\n\n31:52.360 --> 31:53.360\nI'm upset.\n\n31:53.360 --> 31:55.360\nAnd you're hard at work and she's coming in.\n\n31:55.360 --> 31:57.360\nShe needs, you know, something that's important.\n\n31:57.360 --> 31:59.360\nIt's not an unimportant thing that she needs.\n\n31:59.360 --> 32:01.360\nI'm upset with my wife and it's important.\n\n32:01.360 --> 32:02.360\nBut she needs something.\n\n32:02.360 --> 32:03.360\nShe needs something.\n\n32:03.360 --> 32:05.360\nBut you're upset because you're overworked.\n\n32:05.360 --> 32:06.360\nAnd what am I?\n\n32:06.360 --> 32:07.360\nAm I Irish?\n\n32:07.360 --> 32:08.360\nJerry Seinfeld now.\n\n32:08.360 --> 32:11.360\nNow you're acting in the accent you're just not acting in.\n\n32:11.360 --> 32:12.360\nAll right.\n\n32:12.360 --> 32:14.360\nWell, I need space work then.\n\n32:14.360 --> 32:15.360\nYes.\n\n32:15.360 --> 32:16.360\nWorking on a pair of boots.\n\n32:16.360 --> 32:17.360\nOf course.\n\n32:17.360 --> 32:19.360\nAnd then can you play my wife?\n\n32:19.360 --> 32:20.360\nOh, sorry.\n\n32:20.360 --> 32:21.360\nI didn't mean to do that.\n\n32:21.360 --> 32:23.360\nAnd what, uh, what nationality is she?\n\n32:23.360 --> 32:24.360\nYeah.\n\n32:24.360 --> 32:27.360\nUm, I think that Taster's Choice.\n\n32:27.360 --> 32:28.360\nOkay.\n\n32:28.360 --> 32:29.360\nDo you have a favorite?\n\n32:29.360 --> 32:30.360\nDo you have a favorite?\n\n32:30.360 --> 32:31.360\nUm, maybe Cockney.\n\n32:31.360 --> 32:32.360\nCockney.\n\n32:32.360 --> 32:33.360\nOh, you're, okay.\n\n32:33.360 --> 32:34.360\nGreat.\n\n32:34.360 --> 32:37.360\nOi, I'm sorry for breaking your car.\n\n32:37.360 --> 32:38.360\nI don't know.\n\n32:38.360 --> 32:40.360\nThat's not really good, right?\n\n32:40.360 --> 32:42.360\nWell, I broke your car.\n\n32:42.360 --> 32:43.360\nSorry.\n\n32:43.360 --> 32:45.360\nIt's fine.\n\n32:45.360 --> 32:48.360\nIt's fine.\n\n32:48.360 --> 33:00.360\nOi, it don't seem fine in it.\n\n33:00.360 --> 33:10.360\nI'm frustrated, observing, saying what people are thinking, making boots.\n\n33:10.360 --> 33:13.360\nOi.\n\n33:13.360 --> 33:21.360\nI can't stay mad at you.\n\n33:21.360 --> 33:22.360\nNice.\n\n33:22.360 --> 33:23.360\nSo.\n\n33:23.360 --> 33:28.360\nAutistic Masterpiece Theater.\n\n33:28.360 --> 33:30.360\nSo what did you learn?\n\n33:30.360 --> 33:33.360\nI didn't mean that because we were flapping our arm.\n\n33:33.360 --> 33:34.360\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n33:34.360 --> 33:35.360\nThat was not a flapping joke.\n\n33:35.360 --> 33:38.360\nThat was a, I mean, a personal space joke.\n\n33:38.360 --> 33:41.360\nThat was an empowering solidarity thing.\n\n33:41.360 --> 33:44.360\nI was taking it back.\n\n33:44.360 --> 33:45.360\nYeah.\n\n33:45.360 --> 33:46.360\nUh, yeah.\n\n33:46.360 --> 33:47.360\nYes.\n\n33:47.360 --> 33:48.360\nSo.\n\n33:48.360 --> 33:52.360\nThat's another thing New York and Dan Harbin have in common.\n\n33:52.360 --> 33:54.360\nWe can take things back.\n\n33:54.360 --> 33:57.360\nSo from that experience, did you learn how to act in an accent?\n\n33:57.360 --> 33:58.360\nLike, what can you tell us now?\n\n33:58.360 --> 34:00.360\nBecause you're the only person who's actually done it.\n\n34:00.360 --> 34:06.360\nI just don't think, no, I find myself having to choose between the accent and the acting.\n\n34:06.360 --> 34:07.360\nI don't know.\n\n34:07.360 --> 34:12.360\nLike, how can you, because they both require pretending that you're something else that's\n\n34:12.360 --> 34:13.360\nnot true.\n\n34:13.360 --> 34:15.360\nSo I don't understand these people.\n\n34:15.360 --> 34:20.360\nLike, people from Australia will be going soon and New Zealand actors, like, we're flooded\n\n34:20.360 --> 34:24.360\nwith them and they're brilliant actors and they just learn from childhood if they're\n\n34:24.360 --> 34:28.360\ngoing to be an actor that the brass ring is maybe involves going to the States because\n\n34:28.360 --> 34:30.360\nthat's where the market, you know, has the most jobs.\n\n34:30.360 --> 34:34.360\nAnd, and so they, from a very young age, I think they just, it's just like, oh yeah.\n\n34:34.360 --> 34:37.360\nAnd then here's your American accent, which I don't know.\n\n34:37.360 --> 34:39.360\nIt must just be practice.\n\n34:39.360 --> 34:42.360\nIt's like, like you could raise a baby on a skateboard, maybe.\n\n34:42.360 --> 34:44.360\nAnd it would probably be like Tony Hawk when it was 13.\n\n34:44.360 --> 34:47.360\nAnd then, I mean, we've tried that, right?\n\n34:47.360 --> 34:48.360\nYeah.\n\n34:48.360 --> 34:49.360\nLike I have.\n\n34:49.360 --> 34:50.360\nWell, that's, that's the Olympics.\n\n34:50.360 --> 34:53.860\nThat's all these freakish children who are like, they've all been since, since three\n\n34:53.860 --> 34:57.360\nyears old, they've been like pushed along equipment and stuff.\n\n34:57.360 --> 35:03.360\nAnd then they're like, I'm 13 and I'm crying because I didn't do a rhythm gymnast thing,\n\n35:03.360 --> 35:04.360\nright?\n\n35:04.360 --> 35:05.360\nYeah.\n\n35:05.360 --> 35:06.360\nWho can't identify with that scenario?\n\n35:06.360 --> 35:07.360\nYeah.\n\n35:07.360 --> 35:12.360\nAnd then there's like an old, like, Belgian guy on the side that's like, you did it wrong.\n\n35:12.360 --> 35:17.360\nYou cost my nation gold.\n\n35:17.360 --> 35:18.360\nIs the Olympics still like that?\n\n35:18.360 --> 35:20.360\nThat's why it was like when I...\n\n35:20.360 --> 35:21.360\nAll Belgian.\n\n35:21.360 --> 35:22.360\nAll Belgian.\n\n35:22.360 --> 35:23.360\nAll Belgian coaches.\n\n35:23.360 --> 35:24.360\nNo.\n\n35:24.360 --> 35:25.360\nAll countries.\n\n35:25.360 --> 35:26.360\nThey're all Belgium.\n\n35:26.360 --> 35:27.360\nOh, shit.\n\n35:27.360 --> 35:28.360\nYeah.\n\n35:28.360 --> 35:29.360\nUm, why?\n\n35:29.360 --> 35:32.360\nI, I hate the Olympics, you guys.\n\n35:32.360 --> 35:33.360\nYeah.\n\n35:33.360 --> 35:34.360\nBite your tongue.\n\n35:34.360 --> 35:36.360\nI just, why, why do we gotta do it?\n\n35:36.360 --> 35:41.360\nWell, I mean, there's probably a quarter of those events that are like actually, you\n\n35:41.360 --> 35:42.960\nknow, interesting in any way.\n\n35:42.960 --> 35:45.360\nAnd then there's like horse dressage.\n\n35:45.360 --> 35:48.760\nLike, like what, what makes the cutoff?\n\n35:48.760 --> 35:50.560\nHow do we determine what's important?\n\n35:50.560 --> 35:55.360\nThis sounds like a stand-up bit, but I'm just confused.\n\n35:55.360 --> 35:59.360\nThe answer is just committee thinking, like, as far as like, because some, some country\n\n35:59.360 --> 36:07.040\nwill probably say, I wish, oh, we, we of Malta, we think that semaphore should be an Olympic\n\n36:07.040 --> 36:08.040\nsport.\n\n36:08.040 --> 36:09.040\nRight.\n\n36:09.040 --> 36:14.560\nAnd then some, and then the committee probably says like, well, it'll seem to me, uh, as\n\n36:14.560 --> 36:20.360\na Senator, uh, Olympic Senator Johnson speaking, uh, your country, uh, has more\n\n36:20.360 --> 36:22.720\nsemaphore than any other country.\n\n36:22.720 --> 36:25.840\nSo are you trying to cheat your way into a gold medal there?\n\n36:25.840 --> 36:29.640\nOh, you plan to compete with the globe in the spirit of humanity?\n\n36:29.640 --> 36:36.400\nUh, well, both, we want to be good at something and we want to, we want to, we want to also\n\n36:36.400 --> 36:37.400\nparticipate.\n\n36:37.400 --> 36:38.400\nThat's that whole thing.\n\n36:38.400 --> 36:40.480\nThe Olympics are about us getting together.\n\n36:40.480 --> 36:42.080\nIt's about a united planet.\n\n36:42.080 --> 36:43.840\nTo defeat other countries.\n\n36:43.840 --> 36:44.840\nYeah.\n\n36:44.840 --> 36:46.840\nWe do that by swimming better than each other.\n\n36:46.840 --> 36:47.840\nYeah.\n\n36:47.840 --> 36:48.840\nThat's dumb.\n\n36:48.840 --> 36:49.840\nI hate it.\n\n36:49.840 --> 36:53.040\nIt was from a time when the only other time we hung out with other countries is when we\n\n36:53.040 --> 36:58.160\nwere murdering them and like, like, like, like fucking the holes, like that we stabbed\n\n36:58.160 --> 36:59.160\nwith spears.\n\n36:59.160 --> 37:00.160\nRight.\n\n37:00.160 --> 37:02.320\nLike, like, like we were just like monsters.\n\n37:02.320 --> 37:06.520\nLike if you saw a person who spoke a different language, you were like, that encounter did\n\n37:06.520 --> 37:10.120\nnot stop until there were tendons exposed.\n\n37:10.120 --> 37:15.120\nAnd so then it was like fun that we were playing ping pong together.\n\n37:15.120 --> 37:20.800\nThat's a little outdated in this age of smart bombs and dumb children.\n\n37:20.800 --> 37:22.360\nOh, shit.\n\n37:22.360 --> 37:28.200\nI hate to get too political downsizing and uploading, uploading and downsizing.\n\n37:28.200 --> 37:33.920\nNo, I did the same thing, but in the reverse order, okay, upsizing and downloading.\n\n37:33.920 --> 37:34.920\nThere we go.\n\n37:34.920 --> 37:35.920\nThat's great.\n\n37:35.920 --> 37:36.920\nWorth it.\n\n37:36.920 --> 37:41.720\nI guess I'm, I guess the thing that scares me about, about the, uh, alt-right movement\n\n37:41.720 --> 37:47.840\nis that I am a Jew-loving intellectual that like is going to just have all of his property\n\n37:47.840 --> 37:55.280\ntaken away from him and, and just like, I've spent 20 years working, yeah, and I thought,\n\n37:55.280 --> 38:00.520\nI thought I'd get, got to have stuff at the end of that, right, which I guess is all anybody's\n\n38:00.520 --> 38:01.520\never saying.\n\n38:01.520 --> 38:05.760\nSo then some people who spent 20 years working and didn't get anything for it now, then, then\n\n38:05.760 --> 38:07.240\nthey get to be Nazis.\n\n38:07.240 --> 38:08.240\nYep.\n\n38:08.240 --> 38:11.880\nAnd I was like, Nazi time, and I'm like, um, hold on a second.\n\n38:11.880 --> 38:14.800\nI spent 20 years preparing for non-Nazi time.\n\n38:14.800 --> 38:16.280\nThank you.\n\n38:16.280 --> 38:20.760\nI think we'll be fine just as long as Obama doesn't take all our guns.\n\n38:20.760 --> 38:24.640\nWell, I'd like to see him try.\n\n38:24.640 --> 38:26.240\nI'd like to see him try.\n\n38:26.240 --> 38:30.600\nLike, that'd be a, that could be a reality show.\n\n38:30.600 --> 38:33.960\nObama's America is just taking guns from people.\n\n38:33.960 --> 38:37.720\nWell, now that his job has become late night talk show appearances, he should just, he\n\n38:37.720 --> 38:39.440\nshould do a bit on Letterman or do it.\n\n38:39.440 --> 38:40.440\nThere's no Letterman.\n\n38:40.440 --> 38:43.120\nOh, that's so sad.\n\n38:43.120 --> 38:46.400\nHe should, he should do a Kimmel bit where he go, he goes door to door and tries to\n\n38:46.400 --> 38:47.400\ntake people's guns.\n\n38:47.400 --> 38:48.800\nIt'd be funny.\n\n38:48.800 --> 38:49.800\nHe'd be very charming.\n\n38:49.800 --> 38:51.920\nI'd, I'd give him my gun.\n\n38:51.920 --> 38:54.680\nEven if I loved my gun and had a gun, I'd give him my gun.\n\n38:54.680 --> 38:55.680\nHe's so charming.\n\n38:55.680 --> 38:56.680\nOh yeah.\n\n38:56.680 --> 38:57.680\nWe're going to miss that.\n\n38:57.680 --> 39:00.120\nI'm going to miss Joe Biden.\n\n39:00.120 --> 39:04.720\nThat's like, I mean, Obama's great, but Joe Biden, he's like, you know, he's, he's just\n\n39:04.720 --> 39:10.120\nfun times Joe, just want to, what's that guy up to, you know, I guess we could still do\n\n39:10.120 --> 39:11.120\nthat.\n\n39:11.120 --> 39:12.120\nI will.\n\n39:12.120 --> 39:16.240\nI'm going to make up my mission to find out what Joe Biden is up to.\n\n39:16.240 --> 39:23.160\nDid you see that clip where he, he's reacting to the, the new email resurgence thing and\n\n39:23.160 --> 39:26.360\nthen he's in, and he's a clip where he's in the middle of an interview and they're bringing\n\n39:26.360 --> 39:28.120\nup and he's like, what's that again?\n\n39:28.120 --> 39:29.120\nWhat's going on?\n\n39:29.120 --> 39:32.040\nLike, look, whatever this is, wherever it came from, and they're like, Anthony Wiener,\n\n39:32.040 --> 39:37.440\nhe's like, Jesus Christ, he has such an organic reaction.\n\n39:37.440 --> 39:38.440\nIt's, it's great.\n\n39:38.440 --> 39:42.240\nThat was everyone's reaction as that information came out.\n\n39:42.240 --> 39:45.520\nWell, Mary Houlihan, am I pronouncing that right?\n\n39:45.520 --> 39:46.520\nYes.\n\n39:46.520 --> 39:47.520\nOkay.\n\n39:47.520 --> 39:48.520\nIt's not like how, how, how Houlihan.\n\n39:48.520 --> 39:49.520\nOh God, no.\n\n39:49.520 --> 39:53.560\nAre you, you must be familiar with Hot Lips Houlihan from Mash, just in name anyway.\n\n39:53.560 --> 39:54.560\nSure.\n\n39:54.560 --> 39:55.560\nSure.\n\n39:55.560 --> 39:56.560\nYeah.\n\n39:56.560 --> 39:57.560\nIs that an Irish name?\n\n39:57.560 --> 39:58.560\nWhat is that?\n\n39:58.560 --> 39:59.560\nYeah.\n\n39:59.560 --> 40:01.560\nHave you been to Ireland?\n\n40:01.560 --> 40:02.560\nI wish.\n\n40:02.560 --> 40:03.560\nHave you?\n\n40:03.560 --> 40:04.560\nNo.\n\n40:04.560 --> 40:12.720\nAnd by the way, you're not allowed to wish until you get there, I think.\n\n40:12.720 --> 40:13.720\nOr is that, is that what it is?\n\n40:13.720 --> 40:14.720\nIs it wishing?\n\n40:14.720 --> 40:15.720\nNo, that's genies.\n\n40:15.720 --> 40:16.720\nYou've got to kiss a rock.\n\n40:16.720 --> 40:17.720\nYou have to capture a leprechaun.\n\n40:17.720 --> 40:18.720\nIrish genies.\n\n40:18.720 --> 40:20.600\nYou will, the leprechaun will give you a wish if you catch them.\n\n40:20.600 --> 40:22.640\nNo, that's the pot of gold, right?\n\n40:22.640 --> 40:24.640\nNo, if you, no, the pot of gold is usually a wish.\n\n40:24.640 --> 40:28.720\nIf you catch the pot of gold, it'll give you a genie.\n\n40:28.720 --> 40:32.560\nYou can buy a genie with the pot of gold and get a wish.\n\n40:32.560 --> 40:37.640\nI think it's that you get a wish if you catch a leprechaun, but most people, by default,\n\n40:37.640 --> 40:38.640\nwish for the pot of gold.\n\n40:38.640 --> 40:41.640\nWell, can you ask for more than a pot of gold?\n\n40:41.640 --> 40:42.640\nNo.\n\n40:42.640 --> 40:43.640\nTwo pots?\n\n40:43.640 --> 40:44.640\nI hate magic.\n\n40:44.640 --> 40:47.160\nTwo, two thoughts, is it?\n\n40:47.160 --> 40:48.160\nTwo pots of gold?\n\n40:48.160 --> 40:49.160\nTwo pots of gold?\n\n40:49.160 --> 40:51.080\nYeah, that's what I'm saying.\n\n40:51.080 --> 40:52.800\nI'm sure there's some variants.\n\n40:52.800 --> 40:56.280\nYou know, in Ireland, everything's a fairy.\n\n40:56.280 --> 40:57.280\nReally?\n\n40:57.280 --> 40:58.280\nYeah.\n\n40:58.280 --> 41:01.000\nEverything's a fairy.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:04.280\nWhen they say fairy, they don't mean little things with wings.\n\n41:04.280 --> 41:05.280\nGoblins are fairies.\n\n41:05.280 --> 41:06.280\nEttercaps are fairies.\n\n41:06.280 --> 41:12.600\nDwargar, dwarves, gnomes, they're all fairies, elves are fairies, orcs are fairies, goblins,\n\n41:12.600 --> 41:15.800\nI probably said goblins, spriggans are fairies.\n\n41:15.800 --> 41:26.320\nThe word fairy is to the supernatural to the Irish what the word pudding is to the British\n\n41:26.320 --> 41:28.560\nin terms of food.\n\n41:28.560 --> 41:31.400\nIt's just all desserts are pudding.\n\n41:31.400 --> 41:34.560\nI could have just said that.\n\n41:34.560 --> 41:37.840\nI didn't need to, because there's nothing that needs to be clarifying.\n\n41:37.840 --> 41:41.840\nI'm an overanalogger.\n\n41:41.840 --> 41:45.080\nI'm an analogaholic.\n\n41:45.080 --> 41:46.080\nIn what way?\n\n41:46.080 --> 41:49.520\nWell, it's like this.\n\n41:49.520 --> 41:57.200\nIf analogs were cocaine, I'd have no home.\n\n41:57.200 --> 42:00.400\nThat clears it up.\n\n42:00.400 --> 42:04.520\nAnd then I do too many.\n\n42:04.520 --> 42:05.520\nAnalogs.\n\n42:05.520 --> 42:06.520\nDo you drink?\n\n42:06.520 --> 42:07.520\nDo you drink?\n\n42:07.520 --> 42:11.040\nAre you young enough to ask how old you are?\n\n42:11.040 --> 42:12.040\nHow old?\n\n42:12.040 --> 42:13.040\n26.\n\n42:13.040 --> 42:20.440\nI almost used the word ripe.\n\n42:20.440 --> 42:24.480\nYou can use ripe for old people.\n\n42:24.480 --> 42:30.120\nA ripe old age is fine, but you can't, what a ripe young lady.\n\n42:30.120 --> 42:32.920\nShe's a ripe, she's just so ripe.\n\n42:32.920 --> 42:35.400\nOld people are probably overripe at that point, I think.\n\n42:35.400 --> 42:37.000\nWell, yeah, but I think we flatter them.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:38.920\nIt's like saying take them out early.\n\n42:38.920 --> 42:45.960\nI remember there was a commercial for Wheel of Fortune when I was a kid, and it's a great\n\n42:45.960 --> 42:50.520\nshow for the young, and it showed like a kid playing Wheel of Fortune, and then it cut\n\n42:50.520 --> 42:53.480\nto an old lady spinning the wheel to the young at heart.\n\n42:53.480 --> 42:56.840\nI always thought that was a funny way.\n\n42:56.840 --> 42:57.840\nThat still happens, I think.\n\n42:57.840 --> 42:59.760\nI still hear that occasionally.\n\n42:59.760 --> 43:00.840\nYoung at heart.\n\n43:00.840 --> 43:03.120\nOr they say she's 100 years young.\n\n43:03.120 --> 43:05.120\n100 years ripe.\n\n43:05.120 --> 43:07.480\nWe're ashamed of death.\n\n43:07.480 --> 43:13.320\nWe think that death means, even though it's something that all of us have to do.\n\n43:13.320 --> 43:15.560\nWe think it's, oh shit.\n\n43:15.560 --> 43:16.560\nMaybe not you.\n\n43:16.560 --> 43:17.560\nThat's the thing.\n\n43:17.560 --> 43:18.560\nWe're getting closer.\n\n43:18.560 --> 43:26.640\nWe're getting closer to Turing's parabolic tipping point where people won't age anymore\n\n43:26.640 --> 43:30.240\nbecause we'll be robot brains, something like that.\n\n43:30.240 --> 43:31.240\nGood for you.\n\n43:31.240 --> 43:32.240\nYeah.\n\n43:32.240 --> 43:37.680\nI'm sure your PowerPoints will be amazing.\n\n43:37.680 --> 43:42.760\nIt sucks that they all have to die, but.\n\n43:42.760 --> 43:45.120\nEveryone 27 and over.\n\n43:45.120 --> 43:50.760\nWhen you were born, they handed you a Comic-Con sign, so everyone behind you knew that they\n\n43:50.760 --> 43:51.760\nwouldn't get a signature.\n\n43:51.760 --> 43:52.760\nOh, wait.\n\n43:52.760 --> 43:53.760\nNo, that doesn't make any sense.\n\n43:53.760 --> 43:56.040\nIt's the people in front of you that age more.\n\n43:56.040 --> 43:58.320\nWell, it's like that, but backwards, right?\n\n43:58.320 --> 44:00.600\nIt doesn't make sense, but that is what happens.\n\n44:00.600 --> 44:05.560\nThey said, could you go tell everyone older than you they're going to die?\n\n44:05.560 --> 44:10.480\nAnd you're like, that's a shitty gig, and they're like, after you're done, you get eternity\n\n44:10.480 --> 44:17.960\nto hang out and do keynotes, TED Talks, but everyone watching will be able to live forever.\n\n44:17.960 --> 44:22.240\nYeah, but they'll still want to hear you say stuff.\n\n44:22.240 --> 44:24.360\nAre we supposed to want to stay alive?\n\n44:24.360 --> 44:25.360\nAre we supposed to?\n\n44:25.360 --> 44:28.040\nI hope not.\n\n44:28.040 --> 44:32.840\nI haven't for years, because I'm already starting to get at 43.\n\n44:32.840 --> 44:36.600\nI'm kind of like, I'm not, I'm not going to say like, oh, I'd be stoked to die.\n\n44:36.600 --> 44:40.920\nBut I'm like, I can feel it starting to get in there.\n\n44:40.920 --> 44:45.120\nI can tell by 53, I'll be like, yeah, or we could die.\n\n44:45.120 --> 44:49.960\nLike when someone, when we're arguing about where to go to eat, like Taco Bell or McDonald's\n\n44:49.960 --> 44:54.320\nor death.\n\n44:54.320 --> 44:58.280\nNot that that conversation ever happens, should we go to Taco Bell or McDonald's?\n\n44:58.280 --> 45:00.720\nI don't know why I'm laughing at that.\n\n45:00.720 --> 45:02.320\nEveryone in Wichita is like, that's every night.\n\n45:02.320 --> 45:06.120\nLike wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, sorry, you live in Los Angeles where there's a restaurant,\n\n45:06.120 --> 45:11.200\nnew restaurant opens every night, you fucking rich sack of crap.\n\n45:11.200 --> 45:15.240\nWe have to choose which cock gun our food comes out of, because we have two jobs and\n\n45:15.240 --> 45:19.000\nchildren, you fucking gross elitist prick.\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:24.880\nSorry, sorry Wichita.\n\n45:24.880 --> 45:25.880\nWhy are you listening?\n\n45:25.880 --> 45:28.920\nAren't you part of that big red part?\n\n45:28.920 --> 45:29.920\nWhat is that?\n\n45:29.920 --> 45:34.120\nDo you care about politics?\n\n45:34.120 --> 45:37.000\nSounds about right.\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:40.280\nI think about it a lot, but it makes me mad.\n\n45:40.280 --> 45:43.440\nAre you going to miss Vine?\n\n45:43.440 --> 45:45.840\nKid like yourself, you must have grown up on Vine, right?\n\n45:45.840 --> 45:46.840\nYeah.\n\n45:46.840 --> 45:52.000\nCan you do something for six seconds like you would do on Vine if it was still around?\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:53.000\nYeah.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nCan we see it?\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:59.880\nI'll say start when the Vine starts, I guess, and then I'll say loop when it's over.\n\n45:59.880 --> 46:01.960\nSo then if you want, you can do it again.\n\n46:01.960 --> 46:03.960\nOkay, so start.\n\n46:03.960 --> 46:07.280\nOh, this is Stevie Nicks.\n\n46:07.280 --> 46:08.280\nLoop.\n\n46:08.280 --> 46:09.280\nSorry.\n\n46:09.280 --> 46:10.280\nThat's her.\n\n46:10.280 --> 46:11.280\nYeah.\n\n46:11.280 --> 46:15.160\nWell, you probably reshoot it in that case, if that happened.\n\n46:15.160 --> 46:20.400\nI think what I did is, I made a mistake because I said start two, three, four, so I'll do\n\n46:20.400 --> 46:24.160\nit again and I'll do one, so okay, start.\n\n46:24.160 --> 46:27.040\nThis is Ray Romano and he's a piece of bread.\n\n46:27.040 --> 46:28.040\nLoop.\n\n46:28.040 --> 46:33.200\nThis is Ray Romano and he's a piece of bread.\n\n46:33.200 --> 46:34.200\nOkay.\n\n46:34.200 --> 46:40.480\nThat's probably, we could probably do that on Instagram now if we don't need Vine.\n\n46:40.480 --> 46:41.880\nThat's why it happened.\n\n46:41.880 --> 46:51.080\nFor Vine, for Twitter, for Buyan Vine, for Google, for Buyan Twitter, for Mobile Oil,\n\n46:51.080 --> 46:56.560\nfor Buyan Time Warner, AT&T, and Google.\n\n46:56.560 --> 47:10.160\nSo, 9-11, what happened here, uh-oh, we're fired, oh, is she, because her microphone\n\n47:10.160 --> 47:12.360\nkeeps-ooh, upgrade.\n\n47:12.360 --> 47:13.360\nOh, nice.\n\n47:13.360 --> 47:19.080\nThis is a good chance for me to switch over to, uh, I got to start typing.\n\n47:19.080 --> 47:20.080\nNo.\n\n47:20.080 --> 47:22.440\nOh, no.\n\n47:22.440 --> 47:29.520\nYou should, you should write comically like you were doing while rapping.\n\n47:29.520 --> 47:36.120\nI'm sure that's your wheelhouse.\n\n47:36.120 --> 47:38.640\nI can't even listen to what you're saying while sitting down.\n\n47:38.640 --> 47:40.240\nOh, I know.\n\n47:40.240 --> 47:42.160\nIt'll be great.\n\n47:42.160 --> 47:45.520\nWhatever you suggested, probably won't go well.\n\n47:45.520 --> 47:46.520\nOkay.\n\n47:46.520 --> 47:49.400\nDan's firing up the computer.\n\n47:49.400 --> 47:50.400\nAll right.\n\n47:50.400 --> 47:51.400\nSo, I don't have any ideas.\n\n47:51.400 --> 48:01.760\nI just thought I'd come over here, um, start a new, all right, fade in, interior house,\n\n48:01.760 --> 48:17.200\nnight, uh, Chiquita, 26, is baking, uh, her husband, Mike, oh, shit, I'm sorry guys, I'm\n\n48:17.200 --> 48:18.200\nsorry guys.\n\n48:18.200 --> 48:24.600\nI thought you were just shouting out like I'm with her or, when I hear shouting, I just\n\n48:24.600 --> 48:25.600\ntune it out.\n\n48:25.600 --> 48:29.120\nI'm like, well, this person's just, just, just incomplete.\n\n48:29.120 --> 48:34.560\nBut you weren't, you were, you were, you were relying on me and I was letting you down.\n\n48:34.560 --> 48:36.560\nThat's why you were calling out.\n\n48:36.560 --> 48:39.840\nI have calluses around my ears and soul.\n\n48:39.840 --> 48:44.200\nBecause my parents, frankly, they hit me.\n\n48:44.200 --> 48:47.320\nI know they're sick of hearing that, but stop listening to the podcast.\n\n48:47.320 --> 48:49.320\nYou fucking oafs.\n\n48:49.320 --> 48:51.320\nJust retire.\n\n48:51.320 --> 48:53.160\nSo now do that by rapping.\n\n48:53.160 --> 48:59.080\nWell, my name is Child of Peace and I'm here to say, um, I, I, I, I'm gonna, I'm gonna\n\n48:59.080 --> 49:01.680\nabuse myself in the usual way.\n\n49:01.680 --> 49:02.680\nTell an adult.\n\n49:02.680 --> 49:08.160\nI gotta, I gotta, uh, chicle it in my pocket and a Mike and Ike, uh, he, uh, god damn it,\n\n49:08.160 --> 49:11.760\nuh, and, and, and right about now I'm gonna rap what I like.\n\n49:11.760 --> 49:13.840\nUh, uh, my name is shit.\n\n49:13.840 --> 49:15.840\nI'm typing what I'm saying.\n\n49:15.840 --> 49:22.520\nUh, uh, uh, rapping, rapping on Third Street, going to, to, to town, uh, I'm gonna take a\n\n49:22.520 --> 49:24.400\nwoman out of the town.\n\n49:24.400 --> 49:28.400\nUh, I, I, I'm gonna treat her real nice and open the door.\n\n49:28.400 --> 49:36.800\nI'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna sweep her off her feet and something\n\n49:36.800 --> 49:37.800\nmore.\n\n49:37.800 --> 49:43.160\nUh, uh, uh, and right about now I'm gonna hand the Mike to, to myself because my name\n\n49:43.160 --> 49:44.160\nis Mike.\n\n49:44.160 --> 49:49.880\nUh, uh, uh, I can't, I can't do it at the same time.\n\n49:49.880 --> 49:50.880\nNo, I think that was great.\n\n49:50.880 --> 49:51.880\nThat's what we wanted.\n\n49:51.880 --> 49:57.640\nNo, I can't, you can't, you can't rap and, and, and type dialogue at the same time.\n\n49:57.640 --> 49:58.640\nI know you did it.\n\n49:58.640 --> 49:59.640\nYou, you succeeded.\n\n49:59.640 --> 50:02.320\nThat's all we wanted you to do and you did it.\n\n50:02.320 --> 50:04.240\nI bet you could, this is a good test.\n\n50:04.240 --> 50:08.520\nI bet you could rap and talk about politics at the same time because it takes so little\n\n50:08.520 --> 50:09.520\nbrain space.\n\n50:09.520 --> 50:10.520\nHow do you talk?\n\n50:10.520 --> 50:11.520\nUh, okay.\n\n50:11.520 --> 50:19.120\nUh, Steve says you should improvise Rick and Morty as a script.\n\n50:19.120 --> 50:22.120\nUh, I might be too close to home.\n\n50:22.120 --> 50:23.120\nAlright.\n\n50:23.120 --> 50:24.120\nInterior Morty's house.\n\n50:24.120 --> 50:37.080\nOkay, Rick is inventing something, Morty enters, uh, geez, Rick, what are you inventing?\n\n50:37.080 --> 50:47.840\nThis time, could you make it something that could help me get with a girl?\n\n50:47.840 --> 50:53.960\nRick, Burp, uh, Morty, I don't have time for this.\n\n50:53.960 --> 50:57.960\nI don't have time for this bullshit right now.\n\n50:57.960 --> 51:01.960\nMy brain is huge.\n\n51:01.960 --> 51:07.480\nAh, geez.\n\n51:07.480 --> 51:11.640\nShut up and hand me a screwdriver.\n\n51:11.640 --> 51:13.640\nLife is pointless.\n\n51:13.640 --> 51:15.640\nAh, shit.\n\n51:15.640 --> 51:19.960\nAh, geez, Rick, I can't type.\n\n51:19.960 --> 51:27.960\nUh, Rick, I'm putting my foot down this time, man.\n\n51:27.960 --> 51:28.960\nShit.\n\n51:28.960 --> 51:29.960\nGod damn it.\n\n51:29.960 --> 51:30.960\nFucking cocked.\n\n51:30.960 --> 51:31.960\nFuck.\n\n51:31.960 --> 51:32.960\nOh, shit.\n\n51:32.960 --> 51:33.960\nAh, fuck.\n\n51:33.960 --> 51:34.960\nOkay.\n\n51:34.960 --> 51:38.640\nI said cocked fuck, not cocked sucker.\n\n51:38.640 --> 51:39.960\nThat's politically correct.\n\n51:39.960 --> 51:40.960\nIt's denigrating.\n\n51:40.960 --> 51:43.080\nYou know anyone can suck a cock, Dan.\n\n51:43.080 --> 51:44.080\nIt's not like insulting.\n\n51:44.080 --> 51:47.080\nI'm like, yeah, you're right.\n\n51:47.080 --> 51:52.080\nThank you.\n\n51:52.080 --> 51:53.080\nI'll be here tomorrow.\n\n51:53.080 --> 51:54.800\nIt's sexist.\n\n51:54.800 --> 51:56.640\nIt's not homophobic to say cocked sucker.\n\n51:56.640 --> 51:59.040\nIt's sexist to think it's not all right to say cocked sucker.\n\n51:59.040 --> 52:00.360\nI just think it's funny.\n\n52:00.360 --> 52:02.080\nLike it's just a funny image.\n\n52:02.080 --> 52:03.080\nAnd that's it.\n\n52:03.080 --> 52:07.480\nLike, I'm like, yeah, I could suck a cock.\n\n52:07.480 --> 52:08.480\nThat'd be funny.\n\n52:08.480 --> 52:10.480\nNow that's homophobic.\n\n52:10.480 --> 52:15.360\nIf you're talking to a guy and he says, oh, here's your fries, and you're like, these\n\n52:15.360 --> 52:18.720\nare late, and he's like, fuck you, and you're like, fuck you, cocked sucker.\n\n52:18.720 --> 52:23.840\nYou're saying to that guy as another guy, fuck you, I'm not on your team, and here's\n\n52:23.840 --> 52:25.240\nsome things that are bad about you.\n\n52:25.240 --> 52:27.040\nYou suck cock.\n\n52:27.040 --> 52:31.400\nSo that's bad, because whether the guy's gay or not, you've denigrated a section of\n\n52:31.400 --> 52:32.400\nthe population.\n\n52:32.400 --> 52:34.520\nThat's in the attitude, right?\n\n52:34.520 --> 52:35.520\nIt's in the attitude?\n\n52:35.520 --> 52:36.520\nYeah.\n\n52:36.520 --> 52:37.520\nYou said fuck you.\n\n52:37.520 --> 52:39.760\nYou're not like, oh, thanks for the fry, cocked sucker.\n\n52:39.760 --> 52:49.320\nYou know, that'd be fine.\n\n52:49.320 --> 52:51.880\nWe're all just trying to work it out.\n\n52:51.880 --> 52:58.920\nSo speaking of things that are not, so I don't know, like, I don't know what's politically\n\n52:58.920 --> 53:04.360\ncorrect or not when you're talking about, like, Spencer would like to make love to\n\n53:04.360 --> 53:05.360\nmore women.\n\n53:05.360 --> 53:10.280\nWell, I mean, who doesn't?\n\n53:10.280 --> 53:15.040\nAnd he's also in his mid-twenties, and I'm not going where you think I'm going, right?\n\n53:15.040 --> 53:18.040\nYeah, what the fuck?\n\n53:18.040 --> 53:21.600\nYou're tipping your hand too early, Harmon.\n\n53:21.600 --> 53:26.800\nI don't know where the paths go into hashtag rape culture when you're, like, wingmanning\n\n53:26.800 --> 53:29.840\nin public, when you're like, someone should fuck my friend.\n\n53:29.840 --> 53:34.480\nWell, I think you're just, you know, doing what no one asked you to do, really.\n\n53:34.480 --> 53:36.840\nNo, I know you didn't ask me to do it.\n\n53:36.840 --> 53:37.840\nI'm also being a bad friend.\n\n53:37.840 --> 53:38.840\nI know that.\n\n53:38.840 --> 53:39.840\nBut I just, like...\n\n53:39.840 --> 53:40.840\nFair enough.\n\n53:40.840 --> 53:47.120\nI think, you know, like, Spencer's never going to make the first move, so you should\n\n53:47.120 --> 53:48.120\ngang up in him in an alley.\n\n53:48.120 --> 53:49.320\nThat's also not true.\n\n53:49.320 --> 53:52.760\nI mean, it's not like I'm always going to make the move.\n\n53:52.760 --> 53:53.760\nI mean, yeah.\n\n53:53.760 --> 53:54.760\nI don't want...\n\n53:54.760 --> 53:57.720\nWhy is this happening, Spencer?\n\n53:57.720 --> 53:59.920\nI'm sorry.\n\n53:59.920 --> 54:01.280\nI'm sorry.\n\n54:01.280 --> 54:02.280\nIt's fine.\n\n54:02.280 --> 54:07.560\nCan we bring out...let's bring out...\n\n54:07.560 --> 54:08.880\nBachelor at number one.\n\n54:08.880 --> 54:11.560\nThe show's going great.\n\n54:11.560 --> 54:15.520\nSo let's bring out a head of CISO, Evan Shapiro.\n\n54:15.520 --> 54:17.120\nOh, shit.\n\n54:17.120 --> 54:22.440\nOh, shit, he was quick.\n\n54:22.440 --> 54:26.320\nThis guy's like the king of new media, and he won't have a microphone.\n\n54:26.320 --> 54:27.320\nOh.\n\n54:27.320 --> 54:28.320\nBecause we had...\n\n54:28.320 --> 54:29.320\nIs there a broken one?\n\n54:29.320 --> 54:32.560\nHey, cock-sucker.\n\n54:32.560 --> 54:34.920\nWhere do you stand in calling someone a cock-sucker?\n\n54:34.920 --> 54:36.560\nOh, God.\n\n54:36.560 --> 54:39.080\nI usually don't.\n\n54:39.080 --> 54:41.080\nWhat insults do you usually apply?\n\n54:41.080 --> 54:42.480\nOh, that's a good question.\n\n54:42.480 --> 54:44.280\nYes, it is.\n\n54:44.280 --> 54:47.320\nIt depends on the intelligence of the person I'm talking to.\n\n54:47.320 --> 54:48.320\nIt's fine.\n\n54:48.320 --> 54:49.320\nI don't want to get your joke.\n\n54:49.320 --> 54:50.320\nOkay, thank you.\n\n54:50.320 --> 54:56.760\nBecause I will tell you, when I was in my 20s and the world was different, if I would\n\n54:56.760 --> 55:03.360\nget really mad at another man, I would go full Baldwin, like Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross,\n\n55:03.360 --> 55:12.520\nand further, like a lot of man-on-man insults that aren't woke are...they revolve around\n\n55:12.520 --> 55:20.120\nthe emasculation of the other guy, and so you call him the C-word, and you call him...\n\n55:20.120 --> 55:27.000\nAnd my favorite was always the T-W word.\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.560\nTwain.\n\n55:29.560 --> 55:32.720\nRemember the twain?\n\n55:32.720 --> 55:34.720\nShall we meet, mother cock-sucker?\n\n55:34.720 --> 55:39.600\nNo, you know, it rhymes with the second part of robot.\n\n55:39.600 --> 55:41.600\nYeah, I know the word.\n\n55:41.600 --> 55:42.600\nYeah, okay.\n\n55:42.600 --> 55:43.600\nDo you want...\n\n55:43.600 --> 55:44.600\nAre you trying to get me to say it?\n\n55:44.600 --> 55:45.600\nNo, no, no, it was my favorite.\n\n55:45.600 --> 55:48.320\nIt was like, if I was mad at a guy, I'd be fucking twat.\n\n55:48.320 --> 55:54.120\nI'm not really comfortable with that word, although we just did a show with a comic and\n\n55:54.120 --> 55:58.920\nthe name of the show was American Cunt, and so in the office for a couple of days, you\n\n55:58.920 --> 56:04.520\nknow, the email filter would capture it, or, you know, do you say that title in mixed company\n\n56:04.520 --> 56:05.520\nin the workplace?\n\n56:05.520 --> 56:06.520\nRight.\n\n56:06.520 --> 56:07.520\nYou're the boss.\n\n56:07.520 --> 56:11.520\nIn the U.K., like, it's a word that's like the equivalent of, like, I don't know, asshole\n\n56:11.520 --> 56:12.520\nkind of.\n\n56:12.520 --> 56:13.520\nYeah, kind of.\n\n56:13.520 --> 56:16.520\nHello, Cunt.\n\n56:16.520 --> 56:18.720\nIt's designed for that accent.\n\n56:18.720 --> 56:19.960\nIt's sweet, almost.\n\n56:19.960 --> 56:22.520\nSo let me ask you this, because you're a curator.\n\n56:22.520 --> 56:23.520\nYou're running CISO.\n\n56:23.520 --> 56:28.520\nIt's comedy, and so it's like, we're living in this world now where comedy has come to\n\n56:28.520 --> 56:35.760\na four-way stop sign with multicultural awareness and, like, people trying to evolve into a\n\n56:35.760 --> 56:43.200\nRoddenberry vision of the future, and, like, comedy is about irony, irony is about incongruity\n\n56:43.200 --> 56:49.320\nwith expectations, sometimes it's about shocking people, et cetera, like, I go with the definition.\n\n56:49.320 --> 56:55.080\nI think Jim Norton said, like, just nobody tried to be shocking on purpose, and nobody\n\n56:55.080 --> 56:57.160\ntried to be polite on purpose.\n\n56:57.160 --> 56:58.440\nThat's you not being funny.\n\n56:58.440 --> 57:02.520\nIf you make yourself laugh and stuff, I would go with that.\n\n57:02.520 --> 57:06.960\nThat makes sense to me, but as a person who's in charge of who gets a stand-up special and\n\n57:06.960 --> 57:10.680\nwho doesn't, where do your opinions come in, and how do you employ them?\n\n57:10.680 --> 57:18.400\nWell, I think the hard part is that in a culture where a woman can go on stage and be married\n\n57:18.400 --> 57:25.600\nto the largest cyberbully on earth and, unironically, lecture us about cyberbullying, how are you\n\n57:25.600 --> 57:26.600\nfunny?\n\n57:26.600 --> 57:30.840\nHow does someone respond to that and actually make fun of that in real time?\n\n57:30.840 --> 57:34.840\nBecause you're watching the world turn meta on its head right in front of you, and it's\n\n57:34.840 --> 57:40.320\nvery difficult to react to that in a way that just doesn't seem, you know, even more ironic.\n\n57:40.320 --> 57:43.120\nThings are moving so fast I have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n57:43.120 --> 57:45.320\nI don't even know.\n\n57:45.320 --> 57:51.280\nWell, so I think what's happened now is that you're seeing something like this, where somebody\n\n57:51.280 --> 57:55.600\ngets up and is entirely confessional for an hour without necessarily having a script,\n\n57:55.600 --> 57:59.440\nhas become one of the coolest ways to do comedy.\n\n57:59.440 --> 58:03.560\nAnd so I think what you're doing here and podcasting in general, you know, with your,\n\n58:03.560 --> 58:05.320\nI don't know what your podcast is about.\n\n58:05.320 --> 58:06.320\nMe neither.\n\n58:06.320 --> 58:07.320\nIt's great.\n\n58:07.320 --> 58:10.240\nWhat is it called, Mary Houlayan?\n\n58:10.240 --> 58:13.880\nIt's called What's Up, It's Mary Houlayan.\n\n58:13.880 --> 58:14.880\nThat's the name of it.\n\n58:14.880 --> 58:16.600\nAnd you just had your first show today, right?\n\n58:16.600 --> 58:17.600\nWas that a great one?\n\n58:17.600 --> 58:18.600\nOh yeah.\n\n58:18.600 --> 58:19.600\nYeah.\n\n58:19.600 --> 58:20.600\nHow'd it go?\n\n58:20.600 --> 58:21.600\nOh my God.\n\n58:21.600 --> 58:22.600\nIncredible.\n\n58:22.600 --> 58:23.600\nThey were all there.\n\n58:23.600 --> 58:24.600\nOh, shit.\n\n58:24.600 --> 58:25.600\nThank you.\n\n58:25.600 --> 58:26.600\nThat's a big studio.\n\n58:26.600 --> 58:27.600\nYeah.\n\n58:27.600 --> 58:28.600\nYeah.\n\n58:28.600 --> 58:29.600\nMy living room.\n\n58:29.600 --> 58:30.600\nHey, by the way, Spencer.\n\n58:30.600 --> 58:31.600\nHey.\n\n58:31.600 --> 58:33.120\nYou can't push back the start of the show.\n\n58:33.120 --> 58:35.120\nYeah, no, I know.\n\n58:35.120 --> 58:36.520\nOkay.\n\n58:36.520 --> 58:38.800\nThat's why you know where I'm going to be right after this.\n\n58:38.800 --> 58:39.800\nYou're going to be writing, right?\n\n58:39.800 --> 58:40.800\nYes.\n\n58:40.800 --> 58:41.800\nOkay.\n\n58:41.800 --> 58:43.400\nWho's going to be on the show next week?\n\n58:43.400 --> 58:44.400\nOh.\n\n58:44.400 --> 58:46.560\nWho's going to be on the show next week?\n\n58:46.560 --> 58:47.800\nI don't think we can say it.\n\n58:47.800 --> 58:50.120\nYeah, yeah, we can say.\n\n58:50.120 --> 58:53.120\nIt's possible that these people might drop out again.\n\n58:53.120 --> 58:54.120\nOh.\n\n58:54.120 --> 58:56.320\nWe've had a lot of problems.\n\n58:56.320 --> 58:58.880\nWe've had a lot of problems, Megan.\n\n58:58.880 --> 59:01.760\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n59:01.760 --> 59:03.800\nBut we put up extra scenes on Thursday.\n\n59:03.800 --> 59:04.800\nOh yes.\n\n59:04.800 --> 59:07.720\nYeah, expanded universe.\n\n59:07.720 --> 59:08.720\nYou should check it out.\n\n59:08.720 --> 59:13.120\nIt's the parts that we wish we could have kept in the show, but had to cut for time because\n\n59:13.120 --> 59:14.760\nwe wanted it to be short.\n\n59:14.760 --> 59:18.320\nThere's a whole wrestling match with Paul Tompkins.\n\n59:18.320 --> 59:19.320\nOh yeah.\n\n59:19.320 --> 59:27.200\nDo you guys mean to imply that things have to sometimes be shaved from a larger?\n\n59:27.200 --> 59:28.200\nIt's all genius.\n\n59:28.200 --> 59:36.880\nIt's all genius, Dan.\n\n59:36.880 --> 59:39.880\nNice.\n\n59:39.880 --> 59:50.240\nBecause it just makes me think of how I'm so tired of having to choose how to shave.\n\n59:50.240 --> 59:51.240\nIs this a sponsor?\n\n59:51.240 --> 59:52.240\nNo.\n\n59:52.240 --> 59:53.240\nWhat?\n\n59:53.240 --> 59:57.720\nWhat do you think we're bought and sold?\n\n59:57.720 --> 01:00:02.000\nWe're just talking about our personal experience with various products we interact with.\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.440\nSpencer, when was the last time you shaved?\n\n01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.600\nOh, I shaved my whole beard because I was going Hollywood Spencer.\n\n01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.000\nYou might have heard the ad.\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.440\nWell, not you, you guys.\n\n01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.440\nCome here.\n\n01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440\nBut yeah, I grew it back.\n\n01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.440\nHow long?\n\n01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.440\nWait, seriously.\n\n01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.440\nHow long did it take you to grow that beard back?\n\n01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.720\nThis is like a seven-year beard.\n\n01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.720\nA seven-year.\n\n01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.720\nThat's a seven-year.\n\n01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.720\nA seven-year.\n\n01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.720\nA seven-year.\n\n01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:31.360\nLook at Levy's laptops, his browser's home page is the IGN.com.\n\n01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:38.400\nLevy's like a little care bear.\n\n01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.360\nHe doesn't have an ounce of hatred in his heart.\n\n01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.240\nI'm sure mine is Pornhub Premium.\n\n01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.720\nIt has to be.\n\n01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.400\nPremium as a home page?\n\n01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.400\nI don't know.\n\n01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.400\nThat's urgent.\n\n01:00:50.400 --> 01:01:04.320\nIt's urgent.\n\n01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:11.320\nSo anyways, I mean...\n\n01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320\nPictures of men shaving.\n\n01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.480\nYeah, you at home listening, it's pictures of men shaving because here's the thing about\n\n01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:21.440\nshaving and women shave, too, and there's no such thing as gender, so this is a commercial\n\n01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.720\nfor humanity.\n\n01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:31.760\nDollarShaveCub.com lets you, the human end user, reach out

01:02:15.760\nSo whether you have a beard that you don't like, or you have one that you like and you\n\n01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:20.360\nwant to spend some time apart from it, or whether you don't want one and you're afraid\n\n01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:27.440\none's about to happen, or whether there's no chance of you having one, but you live\n\n01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:33.080\nin a part of a patriarchy that demands that other parts of your body be hair free, you\n\n01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:37.560\nknow, like, or maybe, hey, maybe you don't, maybe you're offended by that, maybe you choose\n\n01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.080\nto be hairless, and it's an expression of yourself.\n\n01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:45.280\nIn any case, you got a shave.\n\n01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:51.640\nSo why invite the Gillettes and Bix and needless trips to the grocery store into that equation?\n\n01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.120\nThat's not personal, that's not convenient, that's not intimate, and that's certainly\n\n01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.480\nnot millennial.\n\n01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.880\nThere's nothing less millennial than trying to break into that locked up razor fortress\n\n01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.120\nat the drug store.\n\n01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.040\nYeah, what does that say, like, we want you to have this but we don't trust you with it,\n\n01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:13.360\nyou might hijack the store with a razor, like, oh, you're a terrorist that's going to take\n\n01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.080\nover the grocery store by having the first blade pressed down the skin and have the\n\n01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:23.720\nsecond blade lift, well, the third clips, leaving behind a smooth strip of, that's not\n\n01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.360\nhow terrorism works, and it's not how shaving should work.\n\n01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.160\nAnd hey, look, I don't know, I'm no expert on capitalism, but I don't think our advertisers\n\n01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:38.640\nwould want us to exclude terrorism from their potential, I mean, I don't know.\n\n01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.160\nI think they might want to exclude them.\n\n01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.360\nI've seen pictures of these guys, they need a shave.\n\n01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:49.800\nYou think dollar shave is okay with terrorists buying their razors?\n\n01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.200\nAccording to science, as long as they use them to shave, but what I learned in 10th\n\n01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:59.120\ngrade science, the definition of what, we cannot say for sure that their lack of shaving\n\n01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.240\nis causing them to blow things up.\n\n01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.360\nHowever, we do not know that there is not a cause-effect relationship until we do an\n\n01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.840\nexperiment, like going to dollarshaveclub.com slash Harmontown, if you are feeling terroristic\n\n01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.760\ntoday, look in the mirror, are you beardy?\n\n01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:22.520\nDo you know for a fact that the beard is not telling you, like, to hate America?\n\n01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.080\nI don't, I hate America, I don't know what's, I don't know, it could be my beard.\n\n01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.080\nDoes your beard tell you to hate America?\n\n01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:31.080\nI don't know, I don't speak beard, so it doesn't get long enough.\n\n01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:34.480\nYour beard tells you to hate America?\n\n01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:42.960\nThat's why I chose the executive blade, choose your own blade.\n\n01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:51.800\nSo dollarshaveclub.com slash Harmontown, they're going to love that.\n\n01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:56.680\nYou know what's fucked up with the society, I typed in man-shaving into Google, there's\n\n01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:12.360\ngot to be 1,000 images here, I bet if you typed liberty, look at that, a statue, it\n\n01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:17.400\nsays so much about where we're at, look at this, it's just a statue, you know, and it's\n\n01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:26.200\na French one, what if you typed human rights, oh God, you're going to get people that are\n\n01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.680\nlike, no, no, no, okay, yeah, okay.\n\n01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.720\nJust all these images of humans exercising their rights.\n\n01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.400\nDemocracy, there we go, okay, well that's better, it's just the word democracy in a\n\n01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.240\nlot of signs.\n\n01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:44.120\nLevy, you don't have your trackpad reversed for scrolling?\n\n01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:49.080\nFucking get with it, they're not going to change their minds.\n\n01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.400\nAs if people that reverse the trackpad are like, I'm holding out, holding out for what?\n\n01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:59.320\nIt's an oligarchy, oligopoly, I think is what I meant to say.\n\n01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.800\nIt's an Olly something, man, Olly Olly oxen not free.\n\n01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.600\nBut it's his laptop, doesn't he have the right of choice of scrolling direction?\n\n01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:13.480\nI have the right to share it with him and throw bricks through his window that say, leave\n\n01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:19.400\nit, I don't have the right to do that.\n\n01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.640\nYou're a scrolling Nazi.\n\n01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.280\nI'm a scrolling Nazi.\n\n01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:25.680\nNo scroll for you!\n\n01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:30.000\nWhat if you type in Irish Seinfeld, what do you get?\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.680\nThis is good.\n\n01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.600\nSo this is like family feud.\n\n01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600\nSurveys?\n\n01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:43.760\nI don't, okay, showing results for Irish Seinfeld, here they come.\n\n01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:49.920\nAll right, well, it's the Gramercy, it's a very old classic theater, there we go, Irish\n\n01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.880\nSeinfeld, that's just Seinfeld.\n\n01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:57.120\nHe's a global phenomenon, Irish Seinfeld is Seinfeld.\n\n01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:00.320\nYeah, okay, that makes sense.\n\n01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:04.600\nWait, what is this picture, what is this, the cast of Seinfeld in front of the World Trade\n\n01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:19.000\nCenter with an airplane, I mean, it's the cast of Seinfeld in front of the World Trade\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.640\nCenter with the plane going into it.\n\n01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.200\nWhose page is this?\n\n01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:39.720\nIt's an Irish guy's page, because until we wait for it to come up, the URL is Seinfeld-911-exercise-terrible-bad-taste-funny.\n\n01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:44.240\nSeinfeld does 911 as an exercise in terrible bad taste, but it is very funny.\n\n01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:49.840\nAll right, hey, this is a show, I think maybe it's an Ireland, here's a quick extract to\n\n01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:55.920\ngive you the flavor, it nails the, okay, the, hey, by the way, I am so, so sorry about that\n\n01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:03.760\nguy that you were

don't, I don't see this ending well, it's a spec script for Seinfeld, it's a spec\n\n01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.040\nscript for Seinfeld.\n\n01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:22.640\nIt's about Elaine having a boyfriend who dies in 911 and then I'm dealing it, well, I hope\n\n01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:28.160\nthat person's happy, TV's dead, I mean, like, yeah, we're killing it, and by the way, I\n\n01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:35.040\njust like to say, you know, as the company that brings you the Olympics, fuck, can you,\n\n01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.040\ncan you stop them?\n\n01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.040\nCan you do something?\n\n01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040\nI do not have that.\n\n01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.920\nPull some strings, man, pull some rings.\n\n01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.000\nWhy would you want to?\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.400\nBecause they're like, what if I told you that there is a global corporation that just wanted\n\n01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:54.040\nto extract money through the world by way of pretending some sports mattered?\n\n01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.040\nWelcome to America, man.\n\n01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.680\nYeah, I hate it.\n\n01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:06.520\nDo you think sports are a pacification of people that would otherwise murder me, or do you\n\n01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.640\nthink it's encouraging them to keep feeling murdery?\n\n01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640\nBoth.\n\n01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:17.480\nI think sports and other group communal activities help us escape, yeah, absolutely.\n\n01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:23.160\nImagine sports, you know, I've been an Eagles fan since I was born, basically, yeah.\n\n01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:29.840\nLet's see what happens tomorrow, let's see what happens tomorrow, but I don't, there's\n\n01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.800\nnot a rational, I don't have a rational reason for rooting for the Eagles, I've lived in\n\n01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:41.600\nNew York 27 years, and they suck most of the time, or they break my heart every year, and\n\n01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.800\nyet I keep going back.\n\n01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:49.800\nI'm sorry, I typed my name into Google, they're excited.\n\n01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.800\nYou're Googling yourself?\n\n01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.400\nYeah, which I haven't done in a long time.\n\n01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.920\nWhat's the first thing that comes up?\n\n01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.240\nWell, there's, oh, it looks like you purchased a little ad here.\n\n01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.240\nNow that's an ad.\n\n01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:06.080\nDan Harmon, my Wikipedia page, there's my Twitter, I'm Dan Harmon, my AMA, Dan Harmon\n\n01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:12.120\npoops my outdated blog, my story structure, wow, it used to be Dan Harmon's, what's that?\n\n01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.160\nClick on that Twitter rant, what's that about it?\n\n01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.920\nDan Harmon's angry, abusive Twitter rant, that doesn't sound like you.\n\n01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.600\nThat's a year ago, that's a year ago.\n\n01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:25.080\nMakes him seem deeply unhappy.\n\n01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:28.520\nFile this one under comedy with two question marks.\n\n01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.000\nFirst off, none of this is safe for work in any way.\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nThat's not true.\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.200\nBut here we are printing it, because if you scroll down, you will be reading some language\n\n01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.680\nin italics.\n\n01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.920\nLanguage is not the burden of not safe for work at all.\n\n01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.280\nWho's like looking at, oh, that text is naughty.\n\n01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.280\nYou are fired, mister.\n\n01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.480\nSecond off, if you worship Dan Harmon, creator of Community in Rick and Morty, you might\n\n01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:57.800\nwant to stop here, because even your fellow Harmon worshipers think it makes him look\n\n01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.920\nreally small.\n\n01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:05.840\nThe story here is that Harmon was on a plane yesterday, possibly drunk, and someone insulted\n\n01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.840\nhim on Twitter.\n\n01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.920\nThis happens to famous people all the time.\n\n01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.320\nIt even happens to non-famous people all the time.\n\n01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.640\nTwitter is essentially a cauldron of self-promotion links and insults, and there is no escape.\n\n01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.800\nDan Harmon has surely been insulted on Twitter before.\n\n01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.200\nIt's part of the shitty bargain.\n\n01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.680\nThis time, though, something's not.\n\n01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.880\nThis time.\n\n01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:32.240\nHe caved to a dark desire to, quote, inflict genuine pain, unquote.\n\n01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:36.680\nUnfortunately, his nemesis has protected all his or her tweets, so we can't see the original\n\n01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.680\nspark.\n\n01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:41.160\nBut Harmon's responses tell us plenty all by themselves.\n\n01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.560\nUpdate, from the comments, here's the unforgivable incendiary tweet that set Harmon out.\n\n01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.560\nOh, shit.\n\n01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.080\nOkay, I guess you're drunker than expected.\n\n01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.000\nThat's okay, but this isn't that great of an idea.\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.400\nOh, yeah, that's a fucking shitty person.\n\n01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.600\nWho would respond to a tweet like that?\n\n01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.840\nOkay, I guess you're drunk, but whatever, not a good idea.\n\n01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:06.560\nFuck you, let the pain begin.\n\n01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:12.480\nI barely remember this, but I'm now re-mad at that guy.\n\n01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:17.720\nSo I said, by the way, going through a divorce, fucking a drunk, I'm on a plane, fuck you.\n\n01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.440\nMy Twitter, my internet, my planet.\n\n01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.960\nI'm fucking Dan Harmon, I'm not a goddamn politician.\n\n01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:29.560\nThose people are terrible fucking people, I'm not running for election, fuck you.\n\n01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.720\nDon't talk to me shitty, you're gonna get talked to shitty back if I'm in a bad mood.\n\n01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:37.480\nIt happens every day, every day, it happens every day.\n\n01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.480\nEven the non-famous people.\n\n01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.840\nI'm not a fucking senator, man, like fuck you, fuck all of you.\n\n01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:43.920\nSo fucking mad.\n\n01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.360\nAnd then these days people who are sober right now.\n\n01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:51.920\nThere's so sitting politicians that do much worse and it's not a problem at all, like\n\n01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.880\nthey're like, oh, let's stop minorities from voting.\n\n01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.880\nWell, that's true.\n\n01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.880\nI mean, there's been politicians threatening other politicians.\n\n01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:01.880\nYeah, I didn't get drunk and get on a plane and say, I have an idea, all Mexicans are\n\n01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.880\nrapists, let's build a wall around America.\n\n01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.880\nRight.\n\n01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:09.040\nLike that would be like, well, Dan Harmon got drunk the other day and revealed that he's\n\n01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.400\na fucking racist and a Nazi, and I thought, like, no, Dan Harmon got drunk and revealed\n\n01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.360\nsomething he reveals when he's sober, which is that he's a dick and you shouldn't fuck\n\n01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360\nwith him.\n\n01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:22.960\nLike, he was just more in the mood to fuck with you back than to play cookie collector.\n\n01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:27.680\nI'm sure this was pre cookie collector, right?\n\n01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.720\nSo I don't know, I just, all I did, I Kevin Spacey the guy, like I just leaned into him\n\n01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.640\nand like fucking let him have it.\n\n01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.840\nIs there a wrap up?\n\n01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:36.840\nThere's a wrap.\n\n01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:43.440\nOh, it goes on from there and you can revisit the whole debacle at Harmon's Twitter feed\n\n01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.200\nslash Dollar Shave Club if you want to discount.\n\n01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:51.560\nThe interesting thing here, oh, is it interesting is that his victim's Twitter handle was Bird\n\n01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.360\nPerson, which is a Rick and Morty character.\n\n01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:57.960\nSo he's at least nominally a Harmon fan.\n\n01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:58.960\nNominally?\n\n01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.000\nWell, if they follow you on Twitter, I mean, they're already at least nominally a fan of\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000\nyours.\n\n01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.480\nEvery single person that says shitty stuff to me is always following me.\n\n01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:11.480\nEvery person that always says, hey, shut up, you're fat and you're drunk and you're stupid\n\n01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.920\nand no one cares about your opinion.\n\n01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:17.280\nI always go over in the midst of blocking them and right next to the block button is a fucking\n\n01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.640\nfollowing you icon.\n\n01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.560\nAnd I always want to go like, this is insane.\n\n01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.240\nIf you're fucking, you wonder why I'm leaving behind a planet that is going to burn into\n\n01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.240\na cinder.\n\n01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:30.320\nWell, but Twitter's just become a bit masochistic.\n\n01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.880\nYou follow people so that you can get angry at them so that you can evoke some kind of\n\n01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.880\nreaction.\n\n01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:35.880\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:36.880\nAnd that's all fine.\n\n01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.880\nThat's all fair play.\n\n01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.800\nI have never in my life like tried to ban somebody or complain or be like, what's going\n\n01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.800\non on Twitter?\n\n01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.280\nThis is not, this should be illegal.\n\n01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.280\nSomebody should shut PETA down.\n\n01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.760\nI don't suffer the illusion that my problems are the problems of the fucking society around\n\n01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:50.760\nme.\n\n01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:51.760\nI don't wait for anybody to fix my shit.\n\n01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.760\nI just like, if somebody says, fuck you, I'm like, no, fuck you, probably, maybe.\n\n01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.760\nBut do you...\n\n01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.400\nIf I'm coming out of therapy, I'm like, thank you, like for five minutes.\n\n01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.640\nI'm like, oh, yeah, maybe I should fuck me, I guess, it's a good point.\n\n01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.000\nI won't side with the split.\n\n01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.600\nI should engage in some self-care.\n\n01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.000\nI'm going to go shower now.\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:15.240\nBut do you, have you ever posted something in one of these that you regret?\n\n01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.320\nHe regretted this for a while, then he stopped.\n\n01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:21.000\nWell, I regretted the whole experience, but that's different from remorse, like where\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.480\nyou're like, I feel, I shouldn't have done that.\n\n01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:29.560\nLike I don't know, I still forgive myself for, I'm a human being that's on Twitter.\n\n01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:37.640\nRemorse is like, I really acknowledge my crime and I fucking like, I feel terrible that happened.\n\n01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:40.360\nRegret is like, oh shit, that turned into a shit storm.\n\n01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.800\nIf I went back in time, I'd avoid it because it didn't profit anybody.\n\n01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:50.040\nI don't know, fine line, but remorse involves this person that started this shit, not feeling\n\n01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:53.880\nlike a piece of shit, and I'm not willing to go to that world yet.\n\n01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.120\nI don't care if they're 15, I don't care if they have one arm, I don't fucking care,\n\n01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.320\nthey're a dick.\n\n01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:05.720\nAnd an encounter with me and their brush with fame that resulted from it changes their perspective\n\n01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.880\non society's construction, then I've either done a favor or contributed to their fucking\n\n01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:12.200\ngross soup that is our society.\n\n01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.400\nAnd in either case, mwah.\n\n01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:19.640\nThey're probably proud of that moment though, they probably have that thing framed on their\n\n01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.640\nwall somewhere.\n\n01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.680\nSo, the conclusion is, so what the hell just happened?\n\n01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:29.040\nYou're the journalist, obviously we witnessed an incredible explosion of insecurity, narcissism\n\n01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:35.520\nand anger from a man who is both creatively talented, thank you, see that's a, these are\n\n01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.080\nmy worst enemies and they still call me talented, that's the fucking best.\n\n01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.720\nI've never had like, nobody ever, everyone's like, that talented guy is an asshole, I'm\n\n01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:47.000\nlike, boom, mwah.\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:53.240\nAh, I can't, it's both creatively talented and insanely thin skinned, oh heaven for\n\n01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:58.040\nfend that I'd be receptive and have fucking empathy, more than anything my takeaway is\n\n01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:03.920\nthat Dan Harmon is deeply unhappy, I love a good trolling, but this flew beyond that\n\n01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:08.880\ncategory within like, three tweets, hopefully this is a passing moment of counterproductive\n\n01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.800\nchest thumping for Harmon and not the start of an emotional breakdown that ends with him\n\n01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.120\nsmashing into walls in an asylum.\n\n01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.120\nAh, shit.\n\n01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:27.760\nI mean, so that, what are we, that's, orwelling in to say that, hopefully this person being\n\n01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:33.200\npublicly vulnerable on social media and the resulting clickbait articles talking about\n\n01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.120\nhow he's having a meltdown don't result in government intervention.\n\n01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:43.000\nAre you fine, someone should shut PETA down, dude, someone started PETA so you'd say that,\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.920\nthey're already doing their job, go start anti PETA, do something, you fucking schmuck.\n\n01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.400\nLike what the fuck, man, stop reading.\n\n01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.400\nLet's read the comments.\n\n01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.400\nOh.\n\n01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.400\nAlright, comments.\n\n01:17:53.400 --> 01:18:00.720\nHere's a screenshot of the pretty innocuous original tweet, but yeah, we already said\n\n01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:01.720\nthat.\n\n01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.240\nOh, so they didn't research that, someone posted it in the comment and they updated it.\n\n01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.240\nThat's what they said.\n\n01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.240\nI hate this shit, man.\n\n01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.200\nThis is an article that's literally just someone's tweets and then some, it's like\n\n01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.760\nif I told you about something that happened on Twitter and then got paid 100 bucks for\n\n01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:13.760\nit.\n\n01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.120\nBut this person's talking about the person responding, by the way, I never read a single\n\n01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.120\nresponse from this person.\n\n01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.000\nApparently they said English wasn't their first language and they apologized how they\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.360\ncame across, I didn't read anything from them.\n\n01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:28.240\nI was like, I was just typing 140 characters at a time about how they were a piece of shit.\n\n01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.240\nJesus, that poor kid.\n\n01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:31.240\nMeh.\n\n01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.960\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:37.480\nThey definitely said they were sick parents, you are worthless, but this person's quoting\n\n01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.480\nme.\n\n01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:42.200\nYou are worthless, but necessary byproduct of an evolutionary strategy summarizable as\n\n01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.000\nno wrong answers.\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.320\nTo which this person responds, bleh.\n\n01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.720\nGood one.\n\n01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.320\nDan fancies himself some sort of insulting savant, but the only jab I found particularly\n\n01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.840\ninspired was your pistons are generic fears.\n\n01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.040\nLa di da.\n\n01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:06.680\nIs that the Roger Ebert of insults?\n\n01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:10.840\nI am Sarah Silverman's complete lack of surprise.\n\n01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:27.320\nOkay, Dan Harmon has quite a few personality disorders, apparently stemming from an abusive\n\n01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:33.240\nchildhood, he is also an alcoholic and perhaps even a drug addict.\n\n01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:37.320\nAnd although he is a creative genius, fuck an egg.\n\n01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.560\nThese are my enemies.\n\n01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:47.800\nThat would be like if during the debates, like Hillary Clinton was like, okay, I get\n\n01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:53.520\nit, he'd make a great president, but still, I win.\n\n01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.760\nPouring his pain and dysfunctions into his work, if you are familiar with his work, you\n\n01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:59.800\nwill notice how many of his characters are projections of either himself, his hopes or\n\n01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.800\nhis fears.\n\n01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:07.120\nWhat a shallow bag of tricks.\n\n01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:12.000\nHis process is very uneven, although this person may be defending me.\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.440\nHis process is very uneven and because of his, I believe this is probably Todd Vanderwerf\n\n01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:19.360\nfrom The Onion, an anonymous account.\n\n01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:23.480\nHis process is very uneven and because of his many issues, he is very hard to work with,\n\n01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:25.920\nokay, here we go.\n\n01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.520\nHaving constant breakdowns and anxiety attacks and being plain abusive to the point that\n\n01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:37.000\nhis now ex-wife, Erin, was more a caregiver and handler than a spouse and partner in the\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.440\ntraditional sense.\n\n01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:42.880\nSo no surprise that she finally called it quits because you can only take so much abuse.\n\n01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.320\nAnd that's the point that sad little trolls like Joffrey who feel the need to use the\n\n01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:50.880\nname of one of the most hated D-bags in all the fandoms because he thinks it gives him\n\n01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.720\nsome sort of Reddit street cred, wait, I don't even know who they are talking about now.\n\n01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:01.120\nAm I Joffrey or is the person that tweeted me Joffrey, I got to back up.\n\n01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:05.760\nSo no surprise that she finally called it quits because you can only take so much abuse\n\n01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:10.240\nand that's the point that sad little trolls like Joffrey who feel the need to use the\n\n01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:14.480\nsame, who feel the need to use the name of one of the most hated D-bags in all of the\n\n01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:20.080\nfandoms because he thinks it gives him some sort of Reddit street cred but in fact only\n\n01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.880\nshows how desperate for attention they are.\n\n01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:22.880\nDon't get.\n\n01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:29.680\nDon't stop poking Dan Harmon because you think him slapping you is attention that will make\n\n01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.680\nyou happy.\n\n01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:31.680\nIt won't.\n\n01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:35.240\nThere are people who are assholes because they choose to or because they are too lame.\n\n01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:40.400\nThis person can't spell for shit to be something better and then there are people who are assholes\n\n01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:44.600\nbecause they suffer from mental illness, personality disorders and have a ton of real fucked up\n\n01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:45.840\nissues to deal with.\n\n01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:46.840\nThank you.\n\n01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:51.520\nThese are the people that can barely function, I don't know.\n\n01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.880\nAnd if you inform yourselves a little bit about Dan Harmon, you will realize he is one\n\n01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:57.440\nof said people.\n\n01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:06.080\nHe is barely functional, he is a sick person that happens to be a creative genius.\n\n01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:10.160\nIf not, he would probably be living on the streets like so many untreated addicts of\n\n01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:13.880\nmental patients and all the people who don't get that are just a fucking ignorant, cruel\n\n01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:17.640\nreflection of how our society treats people with social disorders, mental illness, personality\n\n01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:22.040\ndisorders and drug addiction by punishing them, humiliating them, like they chose to\n\n01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.040\nbe that way.\n\n01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.040\nLike they are very existent.\n\n01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:27.480\nDid I write this?\n\n01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:34.040\nWas I so drunk that I logged in and I was like, why do you keep... I should be on the\n\n01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.920\nstreets if you hate me so much.\n\n01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:39.600\nLike they are very existent, it's annoying to them and they should just get over their\n\n01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.440\nissues to make your selfish lives better.\n\n01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.880\nDan Harmon is an asshole, but at least he has medical issues to explain why he is this\n\n01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:50.000\nway.\n\n01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.080\nJust to make all the jealous hatters feel better, feel better, hatters feel better in\n\n01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:59.360\ntheir hadding ways.\n\n01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360\nI wrote this.\n\n01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:09.240\nThat's my red herring, like I will spell a couple of things wrong, I'm like, I'll just\n\n01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:12.120\nthrow a couple of extra T's in here.\n\n01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:16.200\nIn their hadding ways, he lives in constant pain and anxiety.\n\n01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:21.160\nI must be an expert at deflecting it because I'm fucking deliriously happy.\n\n01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:24.840\nHe is a very unhappy lonely man that hurts and pushes away everyone around him because\n\n01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:28.920\nthat's just how fucked up he is that he can't have a basic normal healthy relationship and\n\n01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:36.240\nsooner or later he is going to self-destruct while the world watches and I think that will\n\n01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.320\nbe at the Gramercy Theater at 4 p.m.\n\n01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.040\nSigned Steve Levy.\n\n01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:47.800\nI bet if we check that IP address it comes right from inside my house, it's Steve Levy.\n\n01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:50.320\nIt's coming from inside the house.\n\n01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:55.880\nYeah, I don't, I mean, it's, what, so, okay, I mean, like, what do you mean?\n\n01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:00.160\nI'm a creative genius, I'm not functional, I'm functioning so well that you're talking\n\n01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.600\nabout me for eight pages in a comment section.\n\n01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:04.640\nI called you a creative genius twice though.\n\n01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:09.200\nAnd I'm functioning so highly that you're fucking, like, writing more than I am.\n\n01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.840\nLike, I'm getting paid for obscene amounts of money to self-destruct and this is more\n\n01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:19.120\nthan I've written all week.\n\n01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:24.440\nI didn't do this much on Dr. Strange.\n\n01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:27.040\nI just went in there and ate a pizza and was like, yeah, it's cool, he's kind of like\n\n01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:33.200\nRick.\n\n01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.520\nLet's not forget Harmon's the first stages of a divorce.\n\n01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:38.680\nThat's true, okay, so here's the thing, I mean, I want to make sure and clarify, like,\n\n01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.040\nI'm not, like, I very much explained that before that Twitter thing and I never looked\n\n01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.040\nat the kid's responses.\n\n01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.040\nI wasn't talking to him.\n\n01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:50.080\nI very clearly said, this guy caught me at the wrong time, I'm fucking, and my therapist\n\n01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:54.560\nhad warned me and she said, people that are going through divorce, like, it doesn't matter\n\n01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:57.560\nthe circumstances of the divorce, it doesn't matter, fair or unfair, it's like, it's such\n\n01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:05.120\na, it, like, raises up your, like, weird, you become hyper-vigilant about injustice,\n\n01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:09.840\nso you'll just, like, anything that seems unfair to you, you'll just, like, freak out\n\n01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:13.920\nwhether it's unfair to people in a corner talking, like, and then I went and experienced\n\n01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:19.360\nit and I was like, this is what's happening, like, I'm, like, this person's going to get\n\n01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.880\na beat down because they disagreed with me, they told me and I'm like, I need to inflict\n\n01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:24.880\npain right now.\n\n01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:29.000\nAnd then I just, I tweeted a bunch of stuff, I don't know the person, so how can I possibly\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nbe hurtful?\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.440\nI'm the non-anonymous one, I'm the one that everyone gets to call fat and alcoholic and\n\n01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:38.280\nabusive, like, this person's like an expert at my marriage and they're just walking away\n\n01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.200\nclean, they can write all that and they're mentally healthy.\n\n01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.400\nThis person is a fucking, like, this person's a therapist, right?\n\n01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.280\nThis person's in charge of how other people should feel and their response to a stranger\n\n01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:55.000\non Twitter having a bad day is that my wife had to feed me pudding because I'm, like,\n\n01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.440\nthat's fucking rude and judgmental and if I tweeted something like that at somebody else,\n\n01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.800\nit would be incredibly petty and everyone would be like, Dan Harmon attacks Vince Gilligan\n\n01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:08.760\nand invokes his divorce, you know, like, you think breaking bad is so good, how come your\n\n01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:09.760\nmarriage sucks?\n\n01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.480\nIt would be like the end of my career, it would be the end of my career because it wouldn't\n\n01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:18.480\njust be me going like, fuck you, fuck you, people are gross jerks, I'm in a fucking,\n\n01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:21.800\nI'm in a bad mood, everyone's a piece of shit asshole, I'm just like Hannibal Lecter, I'm\n\n01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:28.840\nlocked in a cell, all I can do is talk about fava beans, I can't, like, eat you, quid pro\n\n01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:32.440\nquo, Clarice.\n\n01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:37.200\nIf you listen to me and work with me, I will direct you to a storage unit that will solve\n\n01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.760\na lot of your case for you.\n\n01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:44.840\nThere is a place where a guy for some reason is storing a head in a jar.\n\n01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:49.040\nConspiracy carrot, the voice of a generation.\n\n01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:59.400\nLook at this guy, community sucked shit-flavored dick.\n\n01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:06.920\nThat's like the, that is like the Parks and Rec of insults of community.\n\n01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.080\nWhat's more amazing to me is how anyone can go anywhere on the Internet and not flip out\n\n01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.080\nlike this.\n\n01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:13.360\nOh, I love you Ben Hinman, eight months ago.\n\n01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.360\nBen Hinman?\n\n01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.360\nThat sounds familiar.\n\n01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:16.360\nOh.\n\n01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.360\nNo, I was, it sounds a lot like Dan Harmon.\n\n01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.360\nOh.\n\n01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:27.400\nWait, did I spend the whole show, what am I, what's, Steve Levy's clock says 223, does\n\n01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.400\nthat mean, oh, does that mean-\n\n01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:29.400\nIt's time for a wrap.\n\n01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:30.400\nWe got a wrap.\n\n01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:40.240\nAll right, Mary Houlihan, how can people walking away from this go experience more cockney\n\n01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:47.760\nand more reserved but polite and possibly very cool, assuredly funny and smart because\n\n01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:50.560\nyou're on Feral Audio, shenanigans.\n\n01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:56.840\nYou can follow me on the web at Mary Huli, H-O-U-L-I-E.\n\n01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:04.320\nYou may also listen to my new podcast and you may also go to a comedy show I do.\n\n01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:10.480\nIt's called Cartoon Monsoon and it's every first Friday of the month at Annoyance Theater.\n\n01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:20.920\nAll right, Mary Houlihan, Evan Shapiro, what do you have to plug, Dollar Shave Club?\n\n01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:24.040\nYeah, well I could use a shave right now actually.\n\n01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.640\nNo, I'll plug Harmon Quest.\n\n01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.920\nIt's up right now.\n\n01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:37.600\nAnd we just put ten new chapters of the expanded universe up there which has extra stuff that\n\n01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:43.720\nwe didn't get into, did not shave to it.\n\n01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:50.120\nBut it includes extra stuff with Paul F. Tompkins and Nathan Fillion and a whole bunch of other\n\n01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:51.120\ngreat people.\n\n01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:53.440\nDo you have a favorite one of these deleted moments?\n\n01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:58.280\nI think the scene that got taken out of the wrestling match with Paul F. Tompkins from\n\n01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:59.280\nthe first episode.\n\n01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.280\nIt's been so long though.\n\n01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:06.080\nI like the Aubrey Plaza, I think her introduction piece, I could turn it into something else.\n\n01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:08.720\nIt's like some really funny stuff.\n\n01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:11.240\nThere's so much funny stuff that we had to cut out of that one.\n\n01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.240\nYeah, the Aubrey Plaza episode.\n\n01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:13.240\nHawaiian coffee.\n\n01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:16.480\nIt's my favorite because it's like real time.\n\n01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:19.560\nThat's kind of what I pictured when I thought about playing D&D and animating it is the\n\n01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:25.760\nfact that D&D, Pathfinder, Pathfinder, Pathfinder, Pathfinder, Pathfinder, the fact that fantasy\n\n01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:32.720\nrole playing is often, it's people arguing about how to open a door and it's like hilarious.\n\n01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:33.720\nI did it.\n\n01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:34.720\nI did it.\n\n01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:35.720\nAll right.\n\n01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:36.720\nGreat.\n\n01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.720\nCool.\n\n01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:38.720\nAnd that's all up.\n\n01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:42.280\nYou can get it on any device, iPhone, Android, CISO.com.\n\n01:29:42.280 -->

chocolate.\n\n01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:25.040\nI front your mama until she said, stop it, and then I stopped.\n\n01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.040\nImmediately.\n\n01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:27.040\nOpen

her.\n\n01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:13.040\nLois Lane has more superpowers than Superman because she earned them by the hour.\n\n01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:17.040\nShe disciplined herself and she went to school in an age when people took her for a fool\n\n01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:22.040\nbecause she had no penis where there's just a hole.\n\n01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.040\nDaily Planet.\n\n01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:24.040\nLois Lane.\n\n01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:25.040\nMetropolis.\n\n01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.040\nIs it a plane?\n\n01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:27.040\nNo.\n\n01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.040\nIt's Lois Lane.\n\n01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:29.040\nIs it a plane?\n\n01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.040\nNo.\n\n01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.040\nNo.\n\n01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.040\nIt's Lois

--> 01:31:39.040\nShe got two big titties and a journalist degree.\n\n01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.040\nSorry about that.\n\n01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.040\nKeep it going.\n\n01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:47.040\nMove past it.\n\n01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:50.040\nShe's resistant to objectification.\n\n01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:53.040\nIt's her superpower.\n\n01:31:53.040 --> 01:32:00.040\nShe doesn't have a kryptonite because she's grown in a world that tried to hold her down.\n\n01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:04.040\nShe's more like zoom's dead than that regard.\n\n01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:11.040\nAquaman always gets beef because he talks to fish and coral reefs.\n\n01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:16.040\nGreen lantern.\n\n01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:19.040\nWhoa.\n\n01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:22.040\nHis kryptonite is

01:32:42.040\nMake it green Superman and take over the world with fucking dipshit.\n\n01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.040\nAll right.\n\n01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.040\nNew York.\n\n01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.040\n100 Fifth Street.\n\n01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.040\n100 Avenue.\n\n01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.040\nAlphabet City.\n\n01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.040\nThat's what I'm going to do.\n\n01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.040\nMy pinky is satin island.\n\n01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.040\nSo I'm going to stick it up like a little finger.\n\n01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.040\nAnd all of the rocks.\n\n01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:59.040\nI'm curling up with a fist and I punch you.\n\n01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.040\nBecause I'm New York.\n\n01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:03.040\nIf you're a terrorist, I mean I'm going to punch you if you're a New Yorker.\n\n01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:04.040\nBecause I love New York.\n\n01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:06.040\nThe fist is going to punch terrorism.\n\n01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.040\nI hate 9-11.\n\n01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:10.040\nI hate 9-11.\n\n01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.040\nNever forget.\n\n01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.040\nI hate 9-11.\n\n01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.040\nI hate it more than everyone else can.\n\n01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.040\nIt's 9-11.\n\n01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:18.040\n9-11 happened here.\n\n01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.040\nI hate it.\n\n01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.040\nAnd I don't fear 9-12.\n\n01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.040\nBring it on.\n\n01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:24.040\nYou're going to make it.\n\n01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.040\nYou're going to find out it can't happen.\n\n01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:30.040\nI hate 9-11.\n\n01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.040\nBelow 6th Street you get a nice donut.\n\n01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.040\nYou get some coffee and then you will not wake up.\n\n01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.040\nIf it's a good donut.\n\n01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:39.040\nOkay, starting over.\n\n01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.040\nI go in the subway.\n\n01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:41.040\nI connect the orange to the red.\n\n01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.040\nI take the red line and I wake up.\n\n01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.040\nInstead of going to 3rd Street, go below 4th.\n\n01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.040\nIf I want a good cup of coffee.\n\n01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.040\nBut you got to get it from the pizza dough from the other place.\n\n01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.040\nBecause they bring the water from Toronto or something.\n\n01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:57.040\nBring it home.\n\n01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.040\nJimmy, you're weary.\n\n01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.040\nYou're a huddled masses.\n\n01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.040\nI fucked your mama in all the classes.\n\n01:34:02.040 -->

01:34:12.040\nI tried to bring it home and I fucked it up.\n\n01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.040\nThat was great.\n\n01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:16.040\nHere we go.\n\n01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.040\nCity to

syrup on her.\n\n01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.040\nGave her some eggs.\n\n01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.040\nI had to do it when I saw her legs.\n\n01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:29.040\nBut I liked her for her personality.\n\n01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.040\nAlright, fuck it.\n\n01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.040\nWait, okay.\n\n01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:38.040\nPedophiles are bad.\n\n01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:40.040\nOkay, I feel that flow.\n\n01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:45.040\nDon't fuck kids.\n\n01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.040\nThey're too young.\n\n01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:50.040\nThat's our show,
