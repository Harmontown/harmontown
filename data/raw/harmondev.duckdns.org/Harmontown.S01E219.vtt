08:48.000 --> 09:15.860
Hello, New York!

09:15.860 --> 09:22.920
Welcome to the Fabulous Gramercy Theater in downtown Greenwich, Upper East Greenwich.

09:22.920 --> 09:28.360
It's Harmontown is now in session.

09:28.360 --> 09:33.280
Let's bring to the stage Spencer Crittenden.

09:33.280 --> 09:42.200
Hey guys!

09:42.200 --> 09:45.120
Oh shit.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.840
We're in the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

09:48.840 --> 09:49.840
Dan Harmon.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.840
Thank you, New York!

09:50.840 --> 09:51.840
Thank you!

09:51.840 --> 09:52.840
Oh yeah.

09:52.840 --> 09:53.840
Yeah, we did a little experimental thing.

09:53.840 --> 09:54.840
I did some taping before the show.

09:54.840 --> 09:55.840
Is this the place where we did that the first time?

09:55.840 --> 09:56.840
No.

09:56.840 --> 10:10.080
That was Canada, where everything is an experiment.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.960
Thank you, lights.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.960
Thank you so much.

10:13.960 --> 10:18.960
You know, what do you call it, your circadian schedule, is that what it's called?

10:18.960 --> 10:19.960
Your circadian...

10:19.960 --> 10:20.960
Rhythm.

10:20.960 --> 10:29.280
You know, the sine wave of your circadian ups and downs.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.880
Oh, rhythm.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.720
I'll look it up later.

10:33.720 --> 10:39.600
It's probably telling you that nothing is interesting or funny, or if you're drunk,

10:39.600 --> 10:44.120
that there's something wrong with you, you know, I can't combat that.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.720
Right, we're doing our jobs.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.000
You guys got to step up.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.800
But I did, because I thought, okay, so I wait.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.080
I mean, you don't have to wait.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.080
You are waiting.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.080
You're an audience.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.080
That's what you do.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.080
I don't have to tell you to wait.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.000
Sorry, I'm sorry.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.840
I made like a...on the way here in the cab, I made a PowerPoint.

11:05.840 --> 11:15.840
Wait, okay, Levy said I was here somewhere.

11:15.840 --> 11:19.840
Levy, is it...is it...

11:19.840 --> 11:24.840
Oh, it's in preview.

11:24.840 --> 11:25.840
Okay.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.400
You have open emu on that thing?

11:28.400 --> 11:29.400
We should play Mario.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.400
Oh, there it is.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.400
Okay.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.200
Wait, I can...I think you just...okay.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.200
Okay.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.200
All right.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.200
Steve Levy, everybody.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.200
Yes, yes.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.200
All right.

11:44.200 --> 11:49.040
My presentation for those of you who are later listening and who didn't pay a million dollars,

11:49.040 --> 11:54.440
so who cares about your needs, but for those of you who are listening, this slide show

11:54.440 --> 11:57.840
is called New York Show, Why It Will Be Great.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.920
That's the first slide.

11:58.920 --> 12:05.120
And then...okay, what...all right, all right, it's not really...okay.

12:05.120 --> 12:13.320
I don't know if...I didn't expect it to be this bad.

12:13.320 --> 12:18.080
It's supposed to still be able to like be a slide show, but they're just scrolling through

12:18.080 --> 12:21.680
like a papyrus on screen.

12:21.680 --> 12:22.680
What is a show?

12:22.680 --> 12:27.680
A show is entertainment, success, connection, and there's a boat because it's a...

12:27.680 --> 12:30.200
Why was that boat all wrinkly?

12:30.200 --> 12:34.000
This is a...there's a quote slide with Johnny Appleseed's type quote here.

12:34.000 --> 12:41.000
Okay, so New York and Deanna Harmon are urban, but see the thing is these are supposed to

12:41.000 --> 12:49.000
be slides, so then it's...

12:49.000 --> 12:53.600
Then it would appear that the word uncompromising appeared underneath or at urban, but instead

12:53.600 --> 12:56.120
it's just scrolling through.

12:56.120 --> 13:03.560
Also, my first name's in all caps because the phone knows me that way, and it's...where

13:03.560 --> 13:14.200
of...we're urban, we're uncompromising, we're offended by 9-11, very much so, to the core,

13:14.200 --> 13:19.240
and we're efficient, but there's a triangle I couldn't get rid of.

13:19.240 --> 13:26.360
New York and Deanna Harmon are okay looking from a distance, but less so during the day.

13:26.360 --> 13:33.400
We are...we're up close, parts of us are beautiful, parts of us are scary and smell like pee.

13:33.400 --> 13:37.080
New York and Deanna Harmon, you can tell what we just ate by looking at the ground around

13:37.080 --> 13:44.000
us, except in the case of me, that's like regular food, and New York just...they eat dreams.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.480
It eats dreams.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.520
This is New York City, not a New Yorker.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.520
Boy, Harmon.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.520
Oh, what?

13:49.520 --> 13:50.520
Okay, what?

13:50.520 --> 13:51.520
Wait, wait.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.520
Oh no.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.520
Is that it?

13:53.520 --> 13:54.520
That's the whole thing?

13:54.520 --> 13:55.520
Yeah, I guess so.

13:55.520 --> 13:56.520
It loops.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.520
I didn't know they loop.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.520
Yeah.

13:58.520 --> 14:14.520
All right, also I...you know, okay, all right, later on, maybe we'll...I wish I could type

14:14.520 --> 14:15.520
better.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.520
Oh, now that works.

14:17.520 --> 14:18.520
Okay.

14:18.520 --> 14:22.520
All right, so we have some people we could meet too, but only if I'm really...well, we

14:22.520 --> 14:26.520
have one person we're going to meet no matter what, and then another person if I'm like

14:26.520 --> 14:28.520
drowning.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.080
Oh, that's not very nice.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.080
Now they'll have to figure out which is which.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.040
No, the first person is the person I'd like you to meet.

14:35.040 --> 14:39.160
The second person, if I bring them up, you know that that person is like somebody that

14:39.160 --> 14:40.920
I'm like, we're drowning.

14:40.920 --> 14:41.920
Yeah.

14:41.920 --> 14:45.000
And then they have to know that, but they can use that.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.800
They can be self-effacing about that.

14:46.800 --> 14:50.520
Yeah, I'm sure they'll use that to their advantage.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.520
Yeah.

14:51.520 --> 14:55.520
I have some things that...okay, hold on a second.

14:55.520 --> 15:05.520
Spatially, this is a lot more complicated than we're used to.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.520
Yeah.

15:06.520 --> 15:07.520
A lot of maneuvering.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.520
How are you enjoying this trip to New York?

15:09.520 --> 15:10.520
Oh, I hate it.

15:10.520 --> 15:13.300
I'm in deadline hell right now.

15:13.300 --> 15:17.120
After this, I am sure to go back to continue working on the thing that we're supposed to

15:17.120 --> 15:18.120
shoot in a week.

15:18.120 --> 15:19.120
Oh.

15:19.120 --> 15:23.160
But our second guest, if we're drowning, is our boss from CISO, so you could probably

15:23.160 --> 15:24.160
just...

15:24.160 --> 15:25.160
Ask him.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.160
Okay, the show.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.160
Yeah.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.160
A week.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.160
I hope we drown.

15:29.160 --> 15:34.360
Because also, I hope this show doesn't go that well.

15:34.360 --> 15:44.140
You're talking about a Harmon quest second season is what you're talking about?

15:44.140 --> 15:49.960
Some updates just, if you are a Cookie Collector II person that has joined my Cookie Collector

15:49.960 --> 15:53.520
II team, I didn't know there was no way to kick people off.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.760
a lot of you, there can only be 50 people.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.360
There's a lot of freeloaders on your team.

15:57.360 --> 16:01.640
I don't know if you can figure out a way to leave the team, but if you could, if you've

16:01.640 --> 16:05.280
collected literally zero cookies, that's not how you play Cookie Collector 2.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.480
To lead your camp.

16:07.480 --> 16:12.000
It's not, I'm not an elitist, I'm not saying you gotta work hard and play hard and you

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
know.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
It's called Cookie Collector.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
It's called Cookie Collector.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.600
A lot of you, like 47 of you are taking up 47 of 50 slots and you're collecting zero

16:19.600 --> 16:20.600
cookies.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.240
You can't rumble crumbs that way.

16:23.240 --> 16:27.000
But I'd also like to say the reason I don't appear to be collecting a lot of cookies right

16:27.000 --> 16:29.240
now is because I'm building up bonuses.

16:29.240 --> 16:30.640
I keep prestigeing.

16:30.640 --> 16:31.640
Okay.

16:31.640 --> 16:37.920
All right, so what if that's what they're all doing, though?

16:37.920 --> 16:40.520
But you know, you can't do that without collecting.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.000
These people have collected zero cookies.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.800
Okay, I don't know the game.

16:44.800 --> 16:49.960
Dr. Henry Lee, a world famous forensic scientist.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.960
So this crazy thing happened.

16:51.960 --> 16:52.960
Where is he based?

16:52.960 --> 16:53.960
He lives in California.

16:53.960 --> 16:54.960
We have to get him on the show.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.600
Dr. Henry Lee is amazing.

16:56.600 --> 17:03.560
There's a forensic files marathon happening right now on the television.

17:03.560 --> 17:08.400
And like Cody, Cody recorded him saying the same thing.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.400
She didn't have Tivo.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.400
She wasn't able to freeze it.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.480
It was just like a weird coincidence.

17:11.480 --> 17:15.120
We were like sharing the, you know, him and the JonBenÃ©t Ramsey thing.

17:15.120 --> 17:18.640
He's like, don't steal my papal.

17:18.640 --> 17:23.600
And then it's like, are you allowed to have fun with the fact that a guy speaks very, very

17:23.600 --> 17:24.600
broken English?

17:24.600 --> 17:28.160
It's like, that ties into like, you know, it's like, are those days over?

17:28.160 --> 17:32.040
I don't know if New York City understands that concept.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.240
It's like, where does it bleed into racism?

17:34.240 --> 17:39.840
I think the guy's English is very, very funny, and that's linked to whatever.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.040
He talks funny.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.040
But he can handle it.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.040
He's very, very smart.

17:44.040 --> 17:51.240
And he's just like, he speaks such funny English, and because of his job, he has to talk about

17:51.240 --> 17:52.880
the grossest shit.

17:52.880 --> 17:59.760
And so Cody saw this clip, and she taped it, and it was, Dr. Henry Lee, there was like

17:59.760 --> 18:06.520
a UV ray going over a bed, and there was just all this shit lighting up, and Dr. Henry

18:06.520 --> 18:19.000
Lee says, we found between 150 and 200 individual seamy stains.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.760
That's a lot of seamy stain.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.240
I was just watching over and over again.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.120
Then we checked into our hotel, and we turned down the forensic files, Marathon, and the

18:28.120 --> 18:29.360
same thing was playing.

18:29.360 --> 18:35.520
And we were, oh my God, the same thing happened to me, but with drivers, dinos, and dives.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.240
Oh shit.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.960
What's drivers, diamonds, and dives?

18:38.960 --> 18:39.960
Well, let's move on.

18:39.960 --> 18:40.960
It's fine.

18:40.960 --> 18:46.160
Is there a show about cars that go into the ocean and the people that rescue their treasures?

18:46.160 --> 18:47.160
Yeah.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.400
Posted by Guy Fieri.

18:50.400 --> 18:59.080
Anyways, that is a lot of seamy stain, but I thought it was interesting that he had sort

18:59.080 --> 19:01.440
of a sympathy for the devil kind of delivery on that.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.960
He's like, that's a lot of seamy stain.

19:02.960 --> 19:08.000
And then it cut to a different thing, and I think what he said next is like, but, you

19:08.000 --> 19:11.040
know, or maybe he said, and I should know.

19:11.040 --> 19:15.600
I thought it sounded like sympathy for the bed, right?

19:15.600 --> 19:22.000
I thought it was more like, I thought he was saying, that's a lot of seamy stain, but that

19:22.000 --> 19:26.360
alone does not make man a bad person.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.240
Special people generate seamy.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.800
You may be bad person.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.840
You may be forensic genius.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.920
Maybe that make you make more semen.

19:36.920 --> 19:40.560
I don't know.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.480
Cody killed her first fly today.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.480
What?

19:43.480 --> 19:44.480
Which I, no, no, no.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.720
Did she not like killing bugs?

19:45.720 --> 19:46.720
No, it wasn't that.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.720
That's what I thought.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.720
But she's just bad at it.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.200
She's never got, she's never gotten a kill.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.960
There was a giant fly in the hotel bathroom, and she, she was relaying this all to me.

19:55.960 --> 19:56.960
I wasn't there.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.120
She, she, she injured it with a towel.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.120
Nice.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.120
She went into a crevice.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.120
A good start.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.600
And she, she, so she sprayed it with hairspray.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.600
Also nice.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.760
Until it crawled out of the crevice.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.760
Right.

20:08.760 --> 20:09.760
Dizzy.

20:09.760 --> 20:10.760
And gummed up.

20:10.760 --> 20:11.760
From this great hair.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.160
And, and then she finally smushed it.

20:13.160 --> 20:16.760
And it just made me think, can you imagine, because flies, they literally correct me if

20:16.760 --> 20:17.760
I'm wrong.

20:17.760 --> 20:21.000
The common house fly, its lifespan is one day, right?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.160
I doubt it.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.160
That's not true.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.160
I don't think so.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.160
Maybe.

20:25.160 --> 20:29.200
Do we have an armchair entomologist down here that said no?

20:29.200 --> 20:30.200
Okay.

20:30.200 --> 20:34.800
Well, who, flies in like swamps live a day, someone said.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.240
Well, gnats surely, but flies are bigger than gnats.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.680
I thought they live a day.

20:39.680 --> 20:40.880
Who thinks they know better?

20:40.880 --> 20:42.680
I'm sure some flies live a day, Dan.

20:42.680 --> 20:43.680
Yeah.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.640
Nobody's really willing to, we got a, we got a very delicate hand coming up.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.480
Not, I'm not, that's not, you're not a delicate person.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.560
I'm not saying, I'm saying your hand is delicate, sir.

20:51.560 --> 20:57.680
Uh, saying it was a furtive, furtive.

20:57.680 --> 20:58.680
Thank you.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.200
They live a day as adults.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.200
They live longer as maggots.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.200
I see.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.200
I don't know about that either.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.200
All right.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.200
Well.

21:05.200 --> 21:11.000
I'm just going to call bullshit on anything anyone says from here on out.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.280
This is a very risky thing for me to do, but it would probably happen if I didn't call

21:14.280 --> 21:15.360
for it.

21:15.360 --> 21:20.720
But if anybody were to find out, well, I heard someone yell out 28 days.

21:20.720 --> 21:21.720
28 days?

21:21.720 --> 21:22.720
Wow.

21:22.720 --> 21:23.720
Later.

21:23.720 --> 21:24.720
That's a lot of semestand.

21:24.720 --> 21:25.720
Okay.

21:25.720 --> 21:26.720
28 days.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.720
Okay.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.720
Okay.

21:28.720 --> 21:29.720
So never mind.

21:29.720 --> 21:30.720
Well, what were you going to say?

21:30.720 --> 21:34.040
Well, I was just like, these things live for a day and then like some of them get to live

21:34.040 --> 21:39.280
like the perfect life because it's like there's turds everywhere and they love them.

21:39.280 --> 21:43.400
And it's like, like, and then I was thinking like so many of them just live in our definition

21:43.400 --> 21:47.200
of hell, like, like, like, because they are born and then they're probably like an hour

21:47.200 --> 21:51.600
into their life and then, and then they probably spend, then then somebody's just trying to

21:51.600 --> 21:55.040
swat them the whole time and they're like, can I just please eat a little bit of that

21:55.040 --> 21:59.440
dried milk off that picnic table and, and then there, or there's like a horse tail is

21:59.440 --> 22:03.600
like constantly trying to kill them and their family and I don't know.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.040
But 28 days, they should, they should figure it out.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.040
Oh, they should.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.760
Fly is about it too easy for too long.

22:08.760 --> 22:15.120
They have time to like build a fly house and they could, if they, if they, if they're,

22:15.120 --> 22:19.840
yeah, we don't, they don't deserve our sympathy insects because they, they're like the first

22:19.840 --> 22:22.840
type of organism, the first phylum.

22:22.840 --> 22:23.840
No.

22:23.840 --> 22:24.840
First kingdom.

22:24.840 --> 22:25.840
Kingdom maybe.

22:25.840 --> 22:26.840
No.

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
Kingdoms are animal and.

22:27.840 --> 22:28.840
Oh, yeah.

22:28.840 --> 22:29.840
Animal, kingdom, phylum.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.520
The first phylum to like, you know, start nailing it as far as organization because

22:33.520 --> 22:38.440
they're multicellular organisms that then got meta and fractal about it and said, what

22:38.440 --> 22:44.200
if these multicellular individuals worked in a colony and were social and stuff.

22:44.200 --> 22:47.280
And so they've kind of perfected everything and then they got lazy and they were just

22:47.280 --> 22:51.320
like, well, it's not like, it's not like we're going to turn into lizards and then squirrels

22:51.320 --> 22:55.200
and then monkeys and then the monkeys are going to like hit a gazelle with a femur bone and

22:55.200 --> 22:56.840
make spaceships.

22:56.840 --> 23:02.840
But they were wrong and they've, and they fucking, now they, now they can eat our shit.

23:02.840 --> 23:03.840
And they're like, we love your shit.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.600
And I'm like, yeah, protest more.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.480
That's how Planet of the Apes happened, right?

23:08.480 --> 23:09.480
Just a reminder.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.600
So, okay, hold on.

23:10.600 --> 23:15.760
With these bugs though, I always assume that bugs just like we're little windup toys, right?

23:15.760 --> 23:17.840
But people feel bad about killing bugs.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.080
Like what's the consensus?

23:19.080 --> 23:21.080
Does, does PETA, how does, where does PETA stand?

23:21.080 --> 23:23.680
I don't care what PETA stands for.

23:23.680 --> 23:27.120
That's a good way to get your, some, you blown up.

23:27.120 --> 23:29.840
You know, well, you heard about this PETA thing, right?

23:29.840 --> 23:32.760
About this, this new ad campaign that I was talking about.

23:32.760 --> 23:33.760
Well, they have the women's aid.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.760
I was held down and I was violated and they go, surprise, I'm speaking for cows.

23:36.760 --> 23:37.760
For cows, yeah.

23:37.760 --> 23:38.760
Yeah.

23:38.760 --> 23:44.520
There were people, I saw people's reactions to that included, like I saw somebody on Twitter

23:44.520 --> 23:50.120
being like, this is over the line, PETA needs to be shut down.

23:50.120 --> 23:51.120
That's the problem.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.120
That is our problem.

23:52.120 --> 23:56.040
Like that's why our country is like, like suffering because of people that, it's not because

23:56.040 --> 24:01.920
of all the shit that's going on, it's because we have successfully systematized the infantilization

24:01.920 --> 24:06.440
of, of, of us, of ourselves as a biomass where there are like second or third generation

24:06.440 --> 24:09.160
of people that are just like, that's offensive.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.240
Somebody's going to deal with that for sure.

24:11.240 --> 24:15.120
Like, like, like the teacher's not going to put up with that obnoxious person.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.120
As for me, I'll be over here getting straight A's.

24:17.120 --> 24:21.040
No, you're going to be over here sliding into the ocean and there may be a Nazi elected

24:21.040 --> 24:22.040
in a day.

24:22.040 --> 24:26.520
Like, like, like, like, and I'm not, I'm not, I'm just saying like, we, we have like

24:26.520 --> 24:27.520
that noise.

24:27.520 --> 24:31.740
Like I get, I get where it's coming from, but just specifically the quality of the sound

24:31.740 --> 24:33.240
of that noise was very weird.

24:33.240 --> 24:37.660
Well, because I think like someone said, Zuzza, Zuzza, Zuzza, Zuzza.

24:37.660 --> 24:42.160
I am on that person's side because that is, I'm not, I'm not against them.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.200
I just, I do, I want to understand.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.400
I'm here to grow.

24:45.400 --> 24:52.320
That's the Dairy Queen Parfait of, of, stop saying he might get elected.

24:52.320 --> 24:58.200
And even if he doesn't, what the fuck are we going to do, like, like, and maybe I'm

24:58.200 --> 25:02.400
on the alt right in a Harmontown fan, I don't know.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.400
Yeah.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.320
You've certainly courted them heavily.

25:05.320 --> 25:10.520
Well, that, that Vice-Canada clip that they, they've certainly made me look like an undecided

25:10.520 --> 25:11.520
voter.

25:11.520 --> 25:12.520
Nice.

25:12.520 --> 25:13.520
All I'm saying is everyone's full of shit.

25:13.520 --> 25:24.120
I'm not saying don't go out and stop this guy from hitlering.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.840
He's from, he's, he's from New York.

25:26.840 --> 25:27.840
He's a New York tradition.

25:27.840 --> 25:28.840
Well, isn't...

25:28.840 --> 25:30.840
I know, I know how you feel.

25:30.840 --> 25:35.720
Like, I, like, I, I, I feel like New Yorkers have been, have been like, like, like sick

25:35.720 --> 25:42.160
of that guy for 35 years, and like, and we're, and we're like, and we're like marveling at

25:42.160 --> 25:45.760
when, when the celebrity apprentice happened, like, who in Wichita thought this was a good

25:45.760 --> 25:46.760
idea?

25:46.760 --> 25:47.760
Yeah.

25:47.760 --> 25:51.920
But, but anyways, we don't want to talk about that.

25:51.920 --> 25:55.920
We don't have anything else to talk about, but we've just, we've all been hit over the

25:55.920 --> 25:59.680
head with a sack of potatoes for a year and a half now.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.080
This election's been going on.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.080
That's the new thing.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.680
That's, that's what we got going on.

26:03.680 --> 26:07.520
And we all know nothing's gonna, like, like, like the problem obviously isn't the election.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.360
It's, because the president's got one power.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.920
I flipped out on Twitter recently because the one thing is the Supreme Court thing.

26:12.920 --> 26:17.280
That is why that's, because the president, during their term, if any of these geezers

26:17.280 --> 26:21.840
like kicks it, like, they, they replace them and they replace them along these party lines.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.840
And it's one thing, it's already bad enough that we have this bipartisan system where

26:24.840 --> 26:30.880
these guys are just playing human chess and, and ladies playing human chess, congratulations.

26:30.880 --> 26:35.360
But, but, but it's like, and then it did, now it's just like, they're just like five

26:35.360 --> 26:38.080
year olds and they're fucking with the thing, well, we're not gonna let you be here, you

26:38.080 --> 26:41.520
know, this is fucking unconstitutional, I'm gonna fucking kill myself, I'm gonna kill,

26:41.520 --> 26:42.520
I'm gonna kill myself.

26:42.520 --> 26:46.040
It's the only thing that's legal to say anymore, I'm gonna kill myself.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.040
That's the thing.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.360
I'm gonna kill all of you, I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill myself.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.360
Can't say that.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.360
That's code, I'm gonna kill you.

26:54.360 --> 27:00.160
I'm gonna live forever, every time I kill you, I'm gonna gain power like Highlander.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.800
And then I'll be able to, it's like a, it's like well water in my head, but I can sense

27:04.800 --> 27:05.800
thoughts.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.040
What are you gonna do in Highlander too?

27:07.040 --> 27:13.120
I'm gonna make an ozone shield, what?

27:13.120 --> 27:18.120
That Highlander series, I'll tell you, they did not know what we wanted in a Highlander

27:18.120 --> 27:23.080
too, but there, I'm sure the writers sat down and were like, well it says there can only

27:23.080 --> 27:31.840
be one, and then there's one at the end, shit, pretty cool, they're from Mars, I don't know.

27:31.840 --> 27:39.800
Our next guest is new to the Feral Audio Podcast family, and I know barely anything about her,

27:39.800 --> 27:43.160
but I thought it would be a good chance to get to know her because she was in town.

27:43.160 --> 27:47.760
Please welcome Mary Hoolahan.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.760
Hey.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.760
Hello.

27:51.760 --> 28:03.120
All right, so, if the show's bad, it's your fault.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.120
Sure.

28:04.120 --> 28:06.600
You're from San Francisco, right?

28:06.600 --> 28:07.600
Mm-mm.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.600
Uh-uh, nope.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
No, I'm...

28:09.600 --> 28:11.600
You're from Wichita, right?

28:11.600 --> 28:12.600
Mm-mm-mm.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.120
So you're from New York City, right?

28:14.120 --> 28:15.120
Keep going.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.120
Los Angeles?

28:16.120 --> 28:17.120
Uh-uh.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.120
Uh-uh.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.120
The Anaheim.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.120
No.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.120
Ontario.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.120
I don't know.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.120
Okay.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.200
Well, she doesn't know what's in Ohio.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.680
Are you from the Northwest United States?

28:26.680 --> 28:28.840
Are you from the Northeast United States?

28:28.840 --> 28:29.840
Uh-uh.

28:29.840 --> 28:30.840
Maine.

28:30.840 --> 28:31.840
Uh-uh.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.840
New Hampshire.

28:32.840 --> 28:33.840
Uh-uh.

28:33.840 --> 28:34.840
Pennsylvania.

28:34.840 --> 28:35.840
Philadelphia.

28:35.840 --> 28:36.840
You.

28:36.840 --> 28:40.840
I don't know what's in the Northeast, to be honest.

28:40.840 --> 28:41.840
New York?

28:41.840 --> 28:42.840
Uh-uh.

28:42.840 --> 28:43.840
Right?

28:43.840 --> 28:44.840
Is that in the Northeast?

28:44.840 --> 28:47.840
Uh, the secret Florida above the clouds.

28:47.840 --> 28:51.360
Don't tell them about that.

28:51.360 --> 28:52.840
Uh, all right.

28:52.840 --> 28:53.840
We give up.

28:53.840 --> 28:54.840
Rhode Island.

28:54.840 --> 28:55.840
New Jersey.

28:55.840 --> 28:56.840
Oh.

28:56.840 --> 28:57.840
Oh, yes.

28:57.840 --> 29:02.360
They like that.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.360
Some of them do.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.360
Oh.

29:04.360 --> 29:05.360
This is it.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.360
This is it.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.360
This is it.

29:07.360 --> 29:08.920
We're driving on crazy here.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.360
So you guys are here for the festival, right?

29:10.360 --> 29:11.360
Like, is it...

29:11.360 --> 29:12.360
Or is it...

29:12.360 --> 29:13.360
Is that...

29:13.360 --> 29:14.360
I don't know how this works at the...

29:14.360 --> 29:15.360
There's the New York Comic Festival.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.360
Yeah, I figure, right?

29:16.360 --> 29:17.360
But you can buy tickets.

29:17.360 --> 29:18.360
Okay.

29:18.360 --> 29:19.360
All right.

29:19.360 --> 29:20.360
Fine.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.360
And what are the tickets?

29:21.360 --> 29:22.360
$90?

29:22.360 --> 29:23.360
$700?

29:23.360 --> 29:24.360
What are they?

29:24.360 --> 29:25.360
$700, I think.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.360
$700?

29:26.360 --> 29:27.360
Yeah.

29:27.360 --> 29:28.360
You know how that breaks down?

29:28.360 --> 29:29.360
Like, the Spencer...

29:29.360 --> 29:30.360
Spencer's beard has to be fertilized.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.360
It has to be flown in.

29:32.360 --> 29:33.360
Uh...

29:33.360 --> 29:34.360
People have to fly out.

29:34.360 --> 29:35.360
I'm first class.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.360
I can't...

29:36.360 --> 29:38.360
I need my mint.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.360
My mint service.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.360
My signature mint drink.

29:41.360 --> 29:45.360
Um, anyways, New Jersey.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.360
Thanks for making the drive.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.360
Uh...

29:48.360 --> 29:51.360
So, uh, tell us about, uh, New Media.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.360
Oh, my God.

29:53.360 --> 29:56.360
There's so much media out there.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.360
Not enough time, honestly.

29:58.360 --> 29:59.360
Yeah, no.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.360
Everybody can't watch everything anymore.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.360
Yeah, it's sad.

30:02.360 --> 30:05.360
When I was your age, you could watch everything.

30:05.360 --> 30:10.360
And, uh, and they're at the end of the night, around midnight, they would literally play

30:10.360 --> 30:14.360
the national anthem and show a flag.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.360
And it would go to static.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.360
There wasn't enough TV.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.360
It was insane.

30:19.360 --> 30:23.360
And people would just, like, die in their chairs, smoking cigarettes, watching.

30:23.360 --> 30:24.360
Static.

30:24.360 --> 30:27.360
That's, uh, the original Poltergeist movie is all based on that.

30:27.360 --> 30:31.360
It's like, oh, that's, that's when the ghosts come out of your TV.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.360
Like, because we had nothing.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.360
Like, Spielberg was like, now what?

30:34.360 --> 30:35.360
And it's like flipping channels.

30:35.360 --> 30:39.360
He's like, what if a ghost was there?

30:39.360 --> 30:42.360
There's not going to be any more Spielbergs, because now there's too much to watch.

30:42.360 --> 30:43.360
Yeah.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.360
And Spielberg is like hooked on, uh, the fall.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.360
Yeah.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.360
Netflix.

30:48.360 --> 30:49.360
You watch the fall?

30:49.360 --> 30:50.360
So awesome.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.360
Really?

30:51.360 --> 30:52.360
Jillian Anderson.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.360
Oh, she's in rare form.

30:54.360 --> 30:57.360
Yeah, British.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.360
My favorite form.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.360
She's doing, like, an accent.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.360
Or, or, or she was British the whole time.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.360
Yeah, she's British.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.360
I, in either case, she's impressive.

31:06.360 --> 31:11.360
Uh, I don't understand how people can act in an accent.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.360
It doesn't make sense.

31:14.360 --> 31:17.360
Uh, well, give, uh, give me a, give me an accent.

31:17.360 --> 31:18.360
Irish.

31:18.360 --> 31:19.360
Irish.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.360
And, uh, give me a, uh,

31:20.360 --> 31:21.360
Jerry Seinfeld.

31:21.360 --> 31:32.360
Did you have her notice?

31:32.360 --> 31:34.360
What's with Shalili's?

31:34.360 --> 31:38.360
That doesn't sound like something I'd hit you with.

31:38.360 --> 31:43.360
If you're going to hit someone with something, call it a hitter.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.360
Don't call it something's delightful.

31:45.360 --> 31:49.360
Oh, I'm going to pull out my Shalili.

31:49.360 --> 31:52.360
Okay, now this time you're upset with your wife.

31:52.360 --> 31:53.360
I'm upset.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.360
And you're hard at work and she's coming in.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.360
She needs, you know, something that's important.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.360
It's not an unimportant thing that she needs.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.360
I'm upset with my wife and it's important.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.360
But she needs something.

32:02.360 --> 32:03.360
She needs something.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.360
But you're upset because you're overworked.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.360
And what am I?

32:06.360 --> 32:07.360
Am I Irish?

32:07.360 --> 32:08.360
Jerry Seinfeld now.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.360
Now you're acting in the accent you're just not acting in.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.360
All right.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.360
Well, I need space work then.

32:14.360 --> 32:15.360
Yes.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.360
Working on a pair of boots.

32:16.360 --> 32:17.360
Of course.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.360
And then can you play my wife?

32:19.360 --> 32:20.360
Oh, sorry.

32:20.360 --> 32:21.360
I didn't mean to do that.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.360
And what, uh, what nationality is she?

32:23.360 --> 32:24.360
Yeah.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.360
Um, I think that Taster's Choice.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.360
Okay.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.360
Do you have a favorite?

32:29.360 --> 32:30.360
Do you have a favorite?

32:30.360 --> 32:31.360
Um, maybe Cockney.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.360
Cockney.

32:32.360 --> 32:33.360
Oh, you're, okay.

32:33.360 --> 32:34.360
Great.

32:34.360 --> 32:37.360
Oi, I'm sorry for breaking your car.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.360
I don't know.

32:38.360 --> 32:40.360
That's not really good, right?

32:40.360 --> 32:42.360
Well, I broke your car.

32:42.360 --> 32:43.360
Sorry.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.360
It's fine.

32:45.360 --> 32:48.360
It's fine.

32:48.360 --> 33:00.360
Oi, it don't seem fine in it.

33:00.360 --> 33:10.360
I'm frustrated, observing, saying what people are thinking, making boots.

33:10.360 --> 33:13.360
Oi.

33:13.360 --> 33:21.360
I can't stay mad at you.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.360
Nice.

33:22.360 --> 33:23.360
So.

33:23.360 --> 33:28.360
Autistic Masterpiece Theater.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.360
So what did you learn?

33:30.360 --> 33:33.360
I didn't mean that because we were flapping our arm.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.360
No, no, no, no.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.360
That was not a flapping joke.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.360
That was a, I mean, a personal space joke.

33:38.360 --> 33:41.360
That was an empowering solidarity thing.

33:41.360 --> 33:44.360
I was taking it back.

33:44.360 --> 33:45.360
Yeah.

33:45.360 --> 33:46.360
Uh, yeah.

33:46.360 --> 33:47.360
Yes.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.360
So.

33:48.360 --> 33:52.360
That's another thing New York and Dan Harbin have in common.

33:52.360 --> 33:54.360
We can take things back.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.360
So from that experience, did you learn how to act in an accent?

33:57.360 --> 33:58.360
Like, what can you tell us now?

33:58.360 --> 34:00.360
Because you're the only person who's actually done it.

34:00.360 --> 34:06.360
I just don't think, no, I find myself having to choose between the accent and the acting.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.360
I don't know.

34:07.360 --> 34:12.360
Like, how can you, because they both require pretending that you're something else that's

34:12.360 --> 34:13.360
not true.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.360
So I don't understand these people.

34:15.360 --> 34:20.360
Like, people from Australia will be going soon and New Zealand actors, like, we're flooded

34:20.360 --> 34:24.360
with them and they're brilliant actors and they just learn from childhood if they're

34:24.360 --> 34:28.360
going to be an actor that the brass ring is maybe involves going to the States because

34:28.360 --> 34:30.360
that's where the market, you know, has the most jobs.

34:30.360 --> 34:34.360
And, and so they, from a very young age, I think they just, it's just like, oh yeah.

34:34.360 --> 34:37.360
And then here's your American accent, which I don't know.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.360
It must just be practice.

34:39.360 --> 34:42.360
It's like, like you could raise a baby on a skateboard, maybe.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.360
And it would probably be like Tony Hawk when it was 13.

34:44.360 --> 34:47.360
And then, I mean, we've tried that, right?

34:47.360 --> 34:48.360
Yeah.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.360
Like I have.

34:49.360 --> 34:50.360
Well, that's, that's the Olympics.

34:50.360 --> 34:53.860
That's all these freakish children who are like, they've all been since, since three

34:53.860 --> 34:57.360
years old, they've been like pushed along equipment and stuff.

34:57.360 --> 35:03.360
And then they're like, I'm 13 and I'm crying because I didn't do a rhythm gymnast thing,

35:03.360 --> 35:04.360
right?

35:04.360 --> 35:05.360
Yeah.

35:05.360 --> 35:06.360
Who can't identify with that scenario?

35:06.360 --> 35:07.360
Yeah.

35:07.360 --> 35:12.360
And then there's like an old, like, Belgian guy on the side that's like, you did it wrong.

35:12.360 --> 35:17.360
You cost my nation gold.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.360
Is the Olympics still like that?

35:18.360 --> 35:20.360
That's why it was like when I...

35:20.360 --> 35:21.360
All Belgian.

35:21.360 --> 35:22.360
All Belgian.

35:22.360 --> 35:23.360
All Belgian coaches.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.360
No.

35:24.360 --> 35:25.360
All countries.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.360
They're all Belgium.

35:26.360 --> 35:27.360
Oh, shit.

35:27.360 --> 35:28.360
Yeah.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.360
Um, why?

35:29.360 --> 35:32.360
I, I hate the Olympics, you guys.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.360
Yeah.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.360
Bite your tongue.

35:34.360 --> 35:36.360
I just, why, why do we gotta do it?

35:36.360 --> 35:41.360
Well, I mean, there's probably a quarter of those events that are like actually, you

35:41.360 --> 35:42.960
know, interesting in any way.

35:42.960 --> 35:45.360
And then there's like horse dressage.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.760
Like, like what, what makes the cutoff?

35:48.760 --> 35:50.560
How do we determine what's important?

35:50.560 --> 35:55.360
This sounds like a stand-up bit, but I'm just confused.

35:55.360 --> 35:59.360
The answer is just committee thinking, like, as far as like, because some, some country

35:59.360 --> 36:07.040
will probably say, I wish, oh, we, we of Malta, we think that semaphore should be an Olympic

36:07.040 --> 36:08.040
sport.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.040
Right.

36:09.040 --> 36:14.560
And then some, and then the committee probably says like, well, it'll seem to me, uh, as

36:14.560 --> 36:20.360
a Senator, uh, Olympic Senator Johnson speaking, uh, your country, uh, has more

36:20.360 --> 36:22.720
semaphore than any other country.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.840
So are you trying to cheat your way into a gold medal there?

36:25.840 --> 36:29.640
Oh, you plan to compete with the globe in the spirit of humanity?

36:29.640 --> 36:36.400
Uh, well, both, we want to be good at something and we want to, we want to, we want to also

36:36.400 --> 36:37.400
participate.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.400
That's that whole thing.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.480
The Olympics are about us getting together.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.080
It's about a united planet.

36:42.080 --> 36:43.840
To defeat other countries.

36:43.840 --> 36:44.840
Yeah.

36:44.840 --> 36:46.840
We do that by swimming better than each other.

36:46.840 --> 36:47.840
Yeah.

36:47.840 --> 36:48.840
That's dumb.

36:48.840 --> 36:49.840
I hate it.

36:49.840 --> 36:53.040
It was from a time when the only other time we hung out with other countries is when we

36:53.040 --> 36:58.160
were murdering them and like, like, like, like fucking the holes, like that we stabbed

36:58.160 --> 36:59.160
with spears.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.160
Right.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.320
Like, like, like we were just like monsters.

37:02.320 --> 37:06.520
Like if you saw a person who spoke a different language, you were like, that encounter did

37:06.520 --> 37:10.120
not stop until there were tendons exposed.

37:10.120 --> 37:15.120
And so then it was like fun that we were playing ping pong together.

37:15.120 --> 37:20.800
That's a little outdated in this age of smart bombs and dumb children.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.360
Oh, shit.

37:22.360 --> 37:28.200
I hate to get too political downsizing and uploading, uploading and downsizing.

37:28.200 --> 37:33.920
No, I did the same thing, but in the reverse order, okay, upsizing and downloading.

37:33.920 --> 37:34.920
There we go.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.920
That's great.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.920
Worth it.

37:36.920 --> 37:41.720
I guess I'm, I guess the thing that scares me about, about the, uh, alt-right movement

37:41.720 --> 37:47.840
is that I am a Jew-loving intellectual that like is going to just have all of his property

37:47.840 --> 37:55.280
taken away from him and, and just like, I've spent 20 years working, yeah, and I thought,

37:55.280 --> 38:00.520
I thought I'd get, got to have stuff at the end of that, right, which I guess is all anybody's

38:00.520 --> 38:01.520
ever saying.

38:01.520 --> 38:05.760
So then some people who spent 20 years working and didn't get anything for it now, then, then

38:05.760 --> 38:07.240
they get to be Nazis.

38:07.240 --> 38:08.240
Yep.

38:08.240 --> 38:11.880
And I was like, Nazi time, and I'm like, um, hold on a second.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.800
I spent 20 years preparing for non-Nazi time.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.280
Thank you.

38:16.280 --> 38:20.760
I think we'll be fine just as long as Obama doesn't take all our guns.

38:20.760 --> 38:24.640
Well, I'd like to see him try.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.240
I'd like to see him try.

38:26.240 --> 38:30.600
Like, that'd be a, that could be a reality show.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.960
Obama's America is just taking guns from people.

38:33.960 --> 38:37.720
Well, now that his job has become late night talk show appearances, he should just, he

38:37.720 --> 38:39.440
should do a bit on Letterman or do it.

38:39.440 --> 38:40.440
There's no Letterman.

38:40.440 --> 38:43.120
Oh, that's so sad.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.400
He should, he should do a Kimmel bit where he go, he goes door to door and tries to

38:46.400 --> 38:47.400
take people's guns.

38:47.400 --> 38:48.800
It'd be funny.

38:48.800 --> 38:49.800
He'd be very charming.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.920
I'd, I'd give him my gun.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.680
Even if I loved my gun and had a gun, I'd give him my gun.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.680
He's so charming.

38:55.680 --> 38:56.680
Oh yeah.

38:56.680 --> 38:57.680
We're going to miss that.

38:57.680 --> 39:00.120
I'm going to miss Joe Biden.

39:00.120 --> 39:04.720
That's like, I mean, Obama's great, but Joe Biden, he's like, you know, he's, he's just

39:04.720 --> 39:10.120
fun times Joe, just want to, what's that guy up to, you know, I guess we could still do

39:10.120 --> 39:11.120
that.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.120
I will.

39:12.120 --> 39:16.240
I'm going to make up my mission to find out what Joe Biden is up to.

39:16.240 --> 39:23.160
Did you see that clip where he, he's reacting to the, the new email resurgence thing and

39:23.160 --> 39:26.360
then he's in, and he's a clip where he's in the middle of an interview and they're bringing

39:26.360 --> 39:28.120
up and he's like, what's that again?

39:28.120 --> 39:29.120
What's going on?

39:29.120 --> 39:32.040
Like, look, whatever this is, wherever it came from, and they're like, Anthony Wiener,

39:32.040 --> 39:37.440
he's like, Jesus Christ, he has such an organic reaction.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.440
It's, it's great.

39:38.440 --> 39:42.240
That was everyone's reaction as that information came out.

39:42.240 --> 39:45.520
Well, Mary Houlihan, am I pronouncing that right?

39:45.520 --> 39:46.520
Yes.

39:46.520 --> 39:47.520
Okay.

39:47.520 --> 39:48.520
It's not like how, how, how Houlihan.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.520
Oh God, no.

39:49.520 --> 39:53.560
Are you, you must be familiar with Hot Lips Houlihan from Mash, just in name anyway.

39:53.560 --> 39:54.560
Sure.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.560
Sure.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.560
Yeah.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.560
Is that an Irish name?

39:57.560 --> 39:58.560
What is that?

39:58.560 --> 39:59.560
Yeah.

39:59.560 --> 40:01.560
Have you been to Ireland?

40:01.560 --> 40:02.560
I wish.

40:02.560 --> 40:03.560
Have you?

40:03.560 --> 40:04.560
No.

40:04.560 --> 40:12.720
And by the way, you're not allowed to wish until you get there, I think.

40:12.720 --> 40:13.720
Or is that, is that what it is?

40:13.720 --> 40:14.720
Is it wishing?

40:14.720 --> 40:15.720
No, that's genies.

40:15.720 --> 40:16.720
You've got to kiss a rock.

40:16.720 --> 40:17.720
You have to capture a leprechaun.

40:17.720 --> 40:18.720
Irish genies.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.600
You will, the leprechaun will give you a wish if you catch them.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.640
No, that's the pot of gold, right?

40:22.640 --> 40:24.640
No, if you, no, the pot of gold is usually a wish.

40:24.640 --> 40:28.720
If you catch the pot of gold, it'll give you a genie.

40:28.720 --> 40:32.560
You can buy a genie with the pot of gold and get a wish.

40:32.560 --> 40:37.640
I think it's that you get a wish if you catch a leprechaun, but most people, by default,

40:37.640 --> 40:38.640
wish for the pot of gold.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.640
Well, can you ask for more than a pot of gold?

40:41.640 --> 40:42.640
No.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.640
Two pots?

40:43.640 --> 40:44.640
I hate magic.

40:44.640 --> 40:47.160
Two, two thoughts, is it?

40:47.160 --> 40:48.160
Two pots of gold?

40:48.160 --> 40:49.160
Two pots of gold?

40:49.160 --> 40:51.080
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

40:51.080 --> 40:52.800
I'm sure there's some variants.

40:52.800 --> 40:56.280
You know, in Ireland, everything's a fairy.

40:56.280 --> 40:57.280
Really?

40:57.280 --> 40:58.280
Yeah.

40:58.280 --> 41:01.000
Everything's a fairy.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.280
When they say fairy, they don't mean little things with wings.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.280
Goblins are fairies.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.280
Ettercaps are fairies.

41:06.280 --> 41:12.600
Dwargar, dwarves, gnomes, they're all fairies, elves are fairies, orcs are fairies, goblins,

41:12.600 --> 41:15.800
I probably said goblins, spriggans are fairies.

41:15.800 --> 41:26.320
The word fairy is to the supernatural to the Irish what the word pudding is to the British

41:26.320 --> 41:28.560
in terms of food.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.400
It's just all desserts are pudding.

41:31.400 --> 41:34.560
I could have just said that.

41:34.560 --> 41:37.840
I didn't need to, because there's nothing that needs to be clarifying.

41:37.840 --> 41:41.840
I'm an overanalogger.

41:41.840 --> 41:45.080
I'm an analogaholic.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.080
In what way?

41:46.080 --> 41:49.520
Well, it's like this.

41:49.520 --> 41:57.200
If analogs were cocaine, I'd have no home.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.400
That clears it up.

42:00.400 --> 42:04.520
And then I do too many.

42:04.520 --> 42:05.520
Analogs.

42:05.520 --> 42:06.520
Do you drink?

42:06.520 --> 42:07.520
Do you drink?

42:07.520 --> 42:11.040
Are you young enough to ask how old you are?

42:11.040 --> 42:12.040
How old?

42:12.040 --> 42:13.040
26.

42:13.040 --> 42:20.440
I almost used the word ripe.

42:20.440 --> 42:24.480
You can use ripe for old people.

42:24.480 --> 42:30.120
A ripe old age is fine, but you can't, what a ripe young lady.

42:30.120 --> 42:32.920
She's a ripe, she's just so ripe.

42:32.920 --> 42:35.400
Old people are probably overripe at that point, I think.

42:35.400 --> 42:37.000
Well, yeah, but I think we flatter them.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.920
It's like saying take them out early.

42:38.920 --> 42:45.960
I remember there was a commercial for Wheel of Fortune when I was a kid, and it's a great

42:45.960 --> 42:50.520
show for the young, and it showed like a kid playing Wheel of Fortune, and then it cut

42:50.520 --> 42:53.480
to an old lady spinning the wheel to the young at heart.

42:53.480 --> 42:56.840
I always thought that was a funny way.

42:56.840 --> 42:57.840
That still happens, I think.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.760
I still hear that occasionally.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.840
Young at heart.

43:00.840 --> 43:03.120
Or they say she's 100 years young.

43:03.120 --> 43:05.120
100 years ripe.

43:05.120 --> 43:07.480
We're ashamed of death.

43:07.480 --> 43:13.320
We think that death means, even though it's something that all of us have to do.

43:13.320 --> 43:15.560
We think it's, oh shit.

43:15.560 --> 43:16.560
Maybe not you.

43:16.560 --> 43:17.560
That's the thing.

43:17.560 --> 43:18.560
We're getting closer.

43:18.560 --> 43:26.640
We're getting closer to Turing's parabolic tipping point where people won't age anymore

43:26.640 --> 43:30.240
because we'll be robot brains, something like that.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.240
Good for you.

43:31.240 --> 43:32.240
Yeah.

43:32.240 --> 43:37.680
I'm sure your PowerPoints will be amazing.

43:37.680 --> 43:42.760
It sucks that they all have to die, but.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.120
Everyone 27 and over.

43:45.120 --> 43:50.760
When you were born, they handed you a Comic-Con sign, so everyone behind you knew that they

43:50.760 --> 43:51.760
wouldn't get a signature.

43:51.760 --> 43:52.760
Oh, wait.

43:52.760 --> 43:53.760
No, that doesn't make any sense.

43:53.760 --> 43:56.040
It's the people in front of you that age more.

43:56.040 --> 43:58.320
Well, it's like that, but backwards, right?

43:58.320 --> 44:00.600
It doesn't make sense, but that is what happens.

44:00.600 --> 44:05.560
They said, could you go tell everyone older than you they're going to die?

44:05.560 --> 44:10.480
And you're like, that's a shitty gig, and they're like, after you're done, you get eternity

44:10.480 --> 44:17.960
to hang out and do keynotes, TED Talks, but everyone watching will be able to live forever.

44:17.960 --> 44:22.240
Yeah, but they'll still want to hear you say stuff.

44:22.240 --> 44:24.360
Are we supposed to want to stay alive?

44:24.360 --> 44:25.360
Are we supposed to?

44:25.360 --> 44:28.040
I hope not.

44:28.040 --> 44:32.840
I haven't for years, because I'm already starting to get at 43.

44:32.840 --> 44:36.600
I'm kind of like, I'm not, I'm not going to say like, oh, I'd be stoked to die.

44:36.600 --> 44:40.920
But I'm like, I can feel it starting to get in there.

44:40.920 --> 44:45.120
I can tell by 53, I'll be like, yeah, or we could die.

44:45.120 --> 44:49.960
Like when someone, when we're arguing about where to go to eat, like Taco Bell or McDonald's

44:49.960 --> 44:54.320
or death.

44:54.320 --> 44:58.280
Not that that conversation ever happens, should we go to Taco Bell or McDonald's?

44:58.280 --> 45:00.720
I don't know why I'm laughing at that.

45:00.720 --> 45:02.320
Everyone in Wichita is like, that's every night.

45:02.320 --> 45:06.120
Like wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, sorry, you live in Los Angeles where there's a restaurant,

45:06.120 --> 45:11.200
new restaurant opens every night, you fucking rich sack of crap.

45:11.200 --> 45:15.240
We have to choose which cock gun our food comes out of, because we have two jobs and

45:15.240 --> 45:19.000
children, you fucking gross elitist prick.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.880
Sorry, sorry Wichita.

45:24.880 --> 45:25.880
Why are you listening?

45:25.880 --> 45:28.920
Aren't you part of that big red part?

45:28.920 --> 45:29.920
What is that?

45:29.920 --> 45:34.120
Do you care about politics?

45:34.120 --> 45:37.000
Sounds about right.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.280
I think about it a lot, but it makes me mad.

45:40.280 --> 45:43.440
Are you going to miss Vine?

45:43.440 --> 45:45.840
Kid like yourself, you must have grown up on Vine, right?

45:45.840 --> 45:46.840
Yeah.

45:46.840 --> 45:52.000
Can you do something for six seconds like you would do on Vine if it was still around?

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Yeah.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Can we see it?

45:55.000 --> 45:59.880
I'll say start when the Vine starts, I guess, and then I'll say loop when it's over.

45:59.880 --> 46:01.960
So then if you want, you can do it again.

46:01.960 --> 46:03.960
Okay, so start.

46:03.960 --> 46:07.280
Oh, this is Stevie Nicks.

46:07.280 --> 46:08.280
Loop.

46:08.280 --> 46:09.280
Sorry.

46:09.280 --> 46:10.280
That's her.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.280
Yeah.

46:11.280 --> 46:15.160
Well, you probably reshoot it in that case, if that happened.

46:15.160 --> 46:20.400
I think what I did is, I made a mistake because I said start two, three, four, so I'll do

46:20.400 --> 46:24.160
it again and I'll do one, so okay, start.

46:24.160 --> 46:27.040
This is Ray Romano and he's a piece of bread.

46:27.040 --> 46:28.040
Loop.

46:28.040 --> 46:33.200
This is Ray Romano and he's a piece of bread.

46:33.200 --> 46:34.200
Okay.

46:34.200 --> 46:40.480
That's probably, we could probably do that on Instagram now if we don't need Vine.

46:40.480 --> 46:41.880
That's why it happened.

46:41.880 --> 46:51.080
For Vine, for Twitter, for Buyan Vine, for Google, for Buyan Twitter, for Mobile Oil,

46:51.080 --> 46:56.560
for Buyan Time Warner, AT&T, and Google.

46:56.560 --> 47:10.160
So, 9-11, what happened here, uh-oh, we're fired, oh, is she, because her microphone

47:10.160 --> 47:12.360
keeps-ooh, upgrade.

47:12.360 --> 47:13.360
Oh, nice.

47:13.360 --> 47:19.080
This is a good chance for me to switch over to, uh, I got to start typing.

47:19.080 --> 47:20.080
No.

47:20.080 --> 47:22.440
Oh, no.

47:22.440 --> 47:29.520
You should, you should write comically like you were doing while rapping.

47:29.520 --> 47:36.120
I'm sure that's your wheelhouse.

47:36.120 --> 47:38.640
I can't even listen to what you're saying while sitting down.

47:38.640 --> 47:40.240
Oh, I know.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.160
It'll be great.

47:42.160 --> 47:45.520
Whatever you suggested, probably won't go well.

47:45.520 --> 47:46.520
Okay.

47:46.520 --> 47:49.400
Dan's firing up the computer.

47:49.400 --> 47:50.400
All right.

47:50.400 --> 47:51.400
So, I don't have any ideas.

47:51.400 --> 48:01.760
I just thought I'd come over here, um, start a new, all right, fade in, interior house,

48:01.760 --> 48:17.200
night, uh, Chiquita, 26, is baking, uh, her husband, Mike, oh, shit, I'm sorry guys, I'm

48:17.200 --> 48:18.200
sorry guys.

48:18.200 --> 48:24.600
I thought you were just shouting out like I'm with her or, when I hear shouting, I just

48:24.600 --> 48:25.600
tune it out.

48:25.600 --> 48:29.120
I'm like, well, this person's just, just, just incomplete.

48:29.120 --> 48:34.560
But you weren't, you were, you were, you were relying on me and I was letting you down.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.560
That's why you were calling out.

48:36.560 --> 48:39.840
I have calluses around my ears and soul.

48:39.840 --> 48:44.200
Because my parents, frankly, they hit me.

48:44.200 --> 48:47.320
I know they're sick of hearing that, but stop listening to the podcast.

48:47.320 --> 48:49.320
You fucking oafs.

48:49.320 --> 48:51.320
Just retire.

48:51.320 --> 48:53.160
So now do that by rapping.

48:53.160 --> 48:59.080
Well, my name is Child of Peace and I'm here to say, um, I, I, I, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

48:59.080 --> 49:01.680
abuse myself in the usual way.

49:01.680 --> 49:02.680
Tell an adult.

49:02.680 --> 49:08.160
I gotta, I gotta, uh, chicle it in my pocket and a Mike and Ike, uh, he, uh, god damn it,

49:08.160 --> 49:11.760
uh, and, and, and right about now I'm gonna rap what I like.

49:11.760 --> 49:13.840
Uh, uh, my name is shit.

49:13.840 --> 49:15.840
I'm typing what I'm saying.

49:15.840 --> 49:22.520
Uh, uh, uh, rapping, rapping on Third Street, going to, to, to town, uh, I'm gonna take a

49:22.520 --> 49:24.400
woman out of the town.

49:24.400 --> 49:28.400
Uh, I, I, I'm gonna treat her real nice and open the door.

49:28.400 --> 49:36.800
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna sweep her off her feet and something

49:36.800 --> 49:37.800
more.

49:37.800 --> 49:43.160
Uh, uh, uh, and right about now I'm gonna hand the Mike to, to myself because my name

49:43.160 --> 49:44.160
is Mike.

49:44.160 --> 49:49.880
Uh, uh, uh, I can't, I can't do it at the same time.

49:49.880 --> 49:50.880
No, I think that was great.

49:50.880 --> 49:51.880
That's what we wanted.

49:51.880 --> 49:57.640
No, I can't, you can't, you can't rap and, and, and type dialogue at the same time.

49:57.640 --> 49:58.640
I know you did it.

49:58.640 --> 49:59.640
You, you succeeded.

49:59.640 --> 50:02.320
That's all we wanted you to do and you did it.

50:02.320 --> 50:04.240
I bet you could, this is a good test.

50:04.240 --> 50:08.520
I bet you could rap and talk about politics at the same time because it takes so little

50:08.520 --> 50:09.520
brain space.

50:09.520 --> 50:10.520
How do you talk?

50:10.520 --> 50:11.520
Uh, okay.

50:11.520 --> 50:19.120
Uh, Steve says you should improvise Rick and Morty as a script.

50:19.120 --> 50:22.120
Uh, I might be too close to home.

50:22.120 --> 50:23.120
Alright.

50:23.120 --> 50:24.120
Interior Morty's house.

50:24.120 --> 50:37.080
Okay, Rick is inventing something, Morty enters, uh, geez, Rick, what are you inventing?

50:37.080 --> 50:47.840
This time, could you make it something that could help me get with a girl?

50:47.840 --> 50:53.960
Rick, Burp, uh, Morty, I don't have time for this.

50:53.960 --> 50:57.960
I don't have time for this bullshit right now.

50:57.960 --> 51:01.960
My brain is huge.

51:01.960 --> 51:07.480
Ah, geez.

51:07.480 --> 51:11.640
Shut up and hand me a screwdriver.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.640
Life is pointless.

51:13.640 --> 51:15.640
Ah, shit.

51:15.640 --> 51:19.960
Ah, geez, Rick, I can't type.

51:19.960 --> 51:27.960
Uh, Rick, I'm putting my foot down this time, man.

51:27.960 --> 51:28.960
Shit.

51:28.960 --> 51:29.960
God damn it.

51:29.960 --> 51:30.960
Fucking cocked.

51:30.960 --> 51:31.960
Fuck.

51:31.960 --> 51:32.960
Oh, shit.

51:32.960 --> 51:33.960
Ah, fuck.

51:33.960 --> 51:34.960
Okay.

51:34.960 --> 51:38.640
I said cocked fuck, not cocked sucker.

51:38.640 --> 51:39.960
That's politically correct.

51:39.960 --> 51:40.960
It's denigrating.

51:40.960 --> 51:43.080
You know anyone can suck a cock, Dan.

51:43.080 --> 51:44.080
It's not like insulting.

51:44.080 --> 51:47.080
I'm like, yeah, you're right.

51:47.080 --> 51:52.080
Thank you.

51:52.080 --> 51:53.080
I'll be here tomorrow.

51:53.080 --> 51:54.800
It's sexist.

51:54.800 --> 51:56.640
It's not homophobic to say cocked sucker.

51:56.640 --> 51:59.040
It's sexist to think it's not all right to say cocked sucker.

51:59.040 --> 52:00.360
I just think it's funny.

52:00.360 --> 52:02.080
Like it's just a funny image.

52:02.080 --> 52:03.080
And that's it.

52:03.080 --> 52:07.480
Like, I'm like, yeah, I could suck a cock.

52:07.480 --> 52:08.480
That'd be funny.

52:08.480 --> 52:10.480
Now that's homophobic.

52:10.480 --> 52:15.360
If you're talking to a guy and he says, oh, here's your fries, and you're like, these

52:15.360 --> 52:18.720
are late, and he's like, fuck you, and you're like, fuck you, cocked sucker.

52:18.720 --> 52:23.840
You're saying to that guy as another guy, fuck you, I'm not on your team, and here's

52:23.840 --> 52:25.240
some things that are bad about you.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.040
You suck cock.

52:27.040 --> 52:31.400
So that's bad, because whether the guy's gay or not, you've denigrated a section of

52:31.400 --> 52:32.400
the population.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.520
That's in the attitude, right?

52:34.520 --> 52:35.520
It's in the attitude?

52:35.520 --> 52:36.520
Yeah.

52:36.520 --> 52:37.520
You said fuck you.

52:37.520 --> 52:39.760
You're not like, oh, thanks for the fry, cocked sucker.

52:39.760 --> 52:49.320
You know, that'd be fine.

52:49.320 --> 52:51.880
We're all just trying to work it out.

52:51.880 --> 52:58.920
So speaking of things that are not, so I don't know, like, I don't know what's politically

52:58.920 --> 53:04.360
correct or not when you're talking about, like, Spencer would like to make love to

53:04.360 --> 53:05.360
more women.

53:05.360 --> 53:10.280
Well, I mean, who doesn't?

53:10.280 --> 53:15.040
And he's also in his mid-twenties, and I'm not going where you think I'm going, right?

53:15.040 --> 53:18.040
Yeah, what the fuck?

53:18.040 --> 53:21.600
You're tipping your hand too early, Harmon.

53:21.600 --> 53:26.800
I don't know where the paths go into hashtag rape culture when you're, like, wingmanning

53:26.800 --> 53:29.840
in public, when you're like, someone should fuck my friend.

53:29.840 --> 53:34.480
Well, I think you're just, you know, doing what no one asked you to do, really.

53:34.480 --> 53:36.840
No, I know you didn't ask me to do it.

53:36.840 --> 53:37.840
I'm also being a bad friend.

53:37.840 --> 53:38.840
I know that.

53:38.840 --> 53:39.840
But I just, like...

53:39.840 --> 53:40.840
Fair enough.

53:40.840 --> 53:47.120
I think, you know, like, Spencer's never going to make the first move, so you should

53:47.120 --> 53:48.120
gang up in him in an alley.

53:48.120 --> 53:49.320
That's also not true.

53:49.320 --> 53:52.760
I mean, it's not like I'm always going to make the move.

53:52.760 --> 53:53.760
I mean, yeah.

53:53.760 --> 53:54.760
I don't want...

53:54.760 --> 53:57.720
Why is this happening, Spencer?

53:57.720 --> 53:59.920
I'm sorry.

53:59.920 --> 54:01.280
I'm sorry.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.280
It's fine.

54:02.280 --> 54:07.560
Can we bring out...let's bring out...

54:07.560 --> 54:08.880
Bachelor at number one.

54:08.880 --> 54:11.560
The show's going great.

54:11.560 --> 54:15.520
So let's bring out a head of CISO, Evan Shapiro.

54:15.520 --> 54:17.120
Oh, shit.

54:17.120 --> 54:22.440
Oh, shit, he was quick.

54:22.440 --> 54:26.320
This guy's like the king of new media, and he won't have a microphone.

54:26.320 --> 54:27.320
Oh.

54:27.320 --> 54:28.320
Because we had...

54:28.320 --> 54:29.320
Is there a broken one?

54:29.320 --> 54:32.560
Hey, cock-sucker.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.920
Where do you stand in calling someone a cock-sucker?

54:34.920 --> 54:36.560
Oh, God.

54:36.560 --> 54:39.080
I usually don't.

54:39.080 --> 54:41.080
What insults do you usually apply?

54:41.080 --> 54:42.480
Oh, that's a good question.

54:42.480 --> 54:44.280
Yes, it is.

54:44.280 --> 54:47.320
It depends on the intelligence of the person I'm talking to.

54:47.320 --> 54:48.320
It's fine.

54:48.320 --> 54:49.320
I don't want to get your joke.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.320
Okay, thank you.

54:50.320 --> 54:56.760
Because I will tell you, when I was in my 20s and the world was different, if I would

54:56.760 --> 55:03.360
get really mad at another man, I would go full Baldwin, like Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross,

55:03.360 --> 55:12.520
and further, like a lot of man-on-man insults that aren't woke are...they revolve around

55:12.520 --> 55:20.120
the emasculation of the other guy, and so you call him the C-word, and you call him...

55:20.120 --> 55:27.000
And my favorite was always the T-W word.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.560
Twain.

55:29.560 --> 55:32.720
Remember the twain?

55:32.720 --> 55:34.720
Shall we meet, mother cock-sucker?

55:34.720 --> 55:39.600
No, you know, it rhymes with the second part of robot.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.600
Yeah, I know the word.

55:41.600 --> 55:42.600
Yeah, okay.

55:42.600 --> 55:43.600
Do you want...

55:43.600 --> 55:44.600
Are you trying to get me to say it?

55:44.600 --> 55:45.600
No, no, no, it was my favorite.

55:45.600 --> 55:48.320
It was like, if I was mad at a guy, I'd be fucking twat.

55:48.320 --> 55:54.120
I'm not really comfortable with that word, although we just did a show with a comic and

55:54.120 --> 55:58.920
the name of the show was American Cunt, and so in the office for a couple of days, you

55:58.920 --> 56:04.520
know, the email filter would capture it, or, you know, do you say that title in mixed company

56:04.520 --> 56:05.520
in the workplace?

56:05.520 --> 56:06.520
Right.

56:06.520 --> 56:07.520
You're the boss.

56:07.520 --> 56:11.520
In the U.K., like, it's a word that's like the equivalent of, like, I don't know, asshole

56:11.520 --> 56:12.520
kind of.

56:12.520 --> 56:13.520
Yeah, kind of.

56:13.520 --> 56:16.520
Hello, Cunt.

56:16.520 --> 56:18.720
It's designed for that accent.

56:18.720 --> 56:19.960
It's sweet, almost.

56:19.960 --> 56:22.520
So let me ask you this, because you're a curator.

56:22.520 --> 56:23.520
You're running CISO.

56:23.520 --> 56:28.520
It's comedy, and so it's like, we're living in this world now where comedy has come to

56:28.520 --> 56:35.760
a four-way stop sign with multicultural awareness and, like, people trying to evolve into a

56:35.760 --> 56:43.200
Roddenberry vision of the future, and, like, comedy is about irony, irony is about incongruity

56:43.200 --> 56:49.320
with expectations, sometimes it's about shocking people, et cetera, like, I go with the definition.

56:49.320 --> 56:55.080
I think Jim Norton said, like, just nobody tried to be shocking on purpose, and nobody

56:55.080 --> 56:57.160
tried to be polite on purpose.

56:57.160 --> 56:58.440
That's you not being funny.

56:58.440 --> 57:02.520
If you make yourself laugh and stuff, I would go with that.

57:02.520 --> 57:06.960
That makes sense to me, but as a person who's in charge of who gets a stand-up special and

57:06.960 --> 57:10.680
who doesn't, where do your opinions come in, and how do you employ them?

57:10.680 --> 57:18.400
Well, I think the hard part is that in a culture where a woman can go on stage and be married

57:18.400 --> 57:25.600
to the largest cyberbully on earth and, unironically, lecture us about cyberbullying, how are you

57:25.600 --> 57:26.600
funny?

57:26.600 --> 57:30.840
How does someone respond to that and actually make fun of that in real time?

57:30.840 --> 57:34.840
Because you're watching the world turn meta on its head right in front of you, and it's

57:34.840 --> 57:40.320
very difficult to react to that in a way that just doesn't seem, you know, even more ironic.

57:40.320 --> 57:43.120
Things are moving so fast I have no idea what you're talking about.

57:43.120 --> 57:45.320
I don't even know.

57:45.320 --> 57:51.280
Well, so I think what's happened now is that you're seeing something like this, where somebody

57:51.280 --> 57:55.600
gets up and is entirely confessional for an hour without necessarily having a script,

57:55.600 --> 57:59.440
has become one of the coolest ways to do comedy.

57:59.440 --> 58:03.560
And so I think what you're doing here and podcasting in general, you know, with your,

58:03.560 --> 58:05.320
I don't know what your podcast is about.

58:05.320 --> 58:06.320
Me neither.

58:06.320 --> 58:07.320
It's great.

58:07.320 --> 58:10.240
What is it called, Mary Houlayan?

58:10.240 --> 58:13.880
It's called What's Up, It's Mary Houlayan.

58:13.880 --> 58:14.880
That's the name of it.

58:14.880 --> 58:16.600
And you just had your first show today, right?

58:16.600 --> 58:17.600
Was that a great one?

58:17.600 --> 58:18.600
Oh yeah.

58:18.600 --> 58:19.600
Yeah.

58:19.600 --> 58:20.600
How'd it go?

58:20.600 --> 58:21.600
Oh my God.

58:21.600 --> 58:22.600
Incredible.

58:22.600 --> 58:23.600
They were all there.

58:23.600 --> 58:24.600
Oh, shit.

58:24.600 --> 58:25.600
Thank you.

58:25.600 --> 58:26.600
That's a big studio.

58:26.600 --> 58:27.600
Yeah.

58:27.600 --> 58:28.600
Yeah.

58:28.600 --> 58:29.600
My living room.

58:29.600 --> 58:30.600
Hey, by the way, Spencer.

58:30.600 --> 58:31.600
Hey.

58:31.600 --> 58:33.120
You can't push back the start of the show.

58:33.120 --> 58:35.120
Yeah, no, I know.

58:35.120 --> 58:36.520
Okay.

58:36.520 --> 58:38.800
That's why you know where I'm going to be right after this.

58:38.800 --> 58:39.800
You're going to be writing, right?

58:39.800 --> 58:40.800
Yes.

58:40.800 --> 58:41.800
Okay.

58:41.800 --> 58:43.400
Who's going to be on the show next week?

58:43.400 --> 58:44.400
Oh.

58:44.400 --> 58:46.560
Who's going to be on the show next week?

58:46.560 --> 58:47.800
I don't think we can say it.

58:47.800 --> 58:50.120
Yeah, yeah, we can say.

58:50.120 --> 58:53.120
It's possible that these people might drop out again.

58:53.120 --> 58:54.120
Oh.

58:54.120 --> 58:56.320
We've had a lot of problems.

58:56.320 --> 58:58.880
We've had a lot of problems, Megan.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.760
No, no, no, no.

59:01.760 --> 59:03.800
But we put up extra scenes on Thursday.

59:03.800 --> 59:04.800
Oh yes.

59:04.800 --> 59:07.720
Yeah, expanded universe.

59:07.720 --> 59:08.720
You should check it out.

59:08.720 --> 59:13.120
It's the parts that we wish we could have kept in the show, but had to cut for time because

59:13.120 --> 59:14.760
we wanted it to be short.

59:14.760 --> 59:18.320
There's a whole wrestling match with Paul Tompkins.

59:18.320 --> 59:19.320
Oh yeah.

59:19.320 --> 59:27.200
Do you guys mean to imply that things have to sometimes be shaved from a larger?

59:27.200 --> 59:28.200
It's all genius.

59:28.200 --> 59:36.880
It's all genius, Dan.

59:36.880 --> 59:39.880
Nice.

59:39.880 --> 59:50.240
Because it just makes me think of how I'm so tired of having to choose how to shave.

59:50.240 --> 59:51.240
Is this a sponsor?

59:51.240 --> 59:52.240
No.

59:52.240 --> 59:53.240
What?

59:53.240 --> 59:57.720
What do you think we're bought and sold?

59:57.720 --> 01:00:02.000
We're just talking about our personal experience with various products we interact with.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.440
Spencer, when was the last time you shaved?

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.600
Oh, I shaved my whole beard because I was going Hollywood Spencer.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.000
You might have heard the ad.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.440
Well, not you, you guys.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.440
Come here.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440
But yeah, I grew it back.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.440
How long?

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.440
Wait, seriously.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.440
How long did it take you to grow that beard back?

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.720
This is like a seven-year beard.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.720
A seven-year.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.720
That's a seven-year.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.720
A seven-year.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.720
A seven-year.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:31.360
Look at Levy's laptops, his browser's home page is the IGN.com.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:38.400
Levy's like a little care bear.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.360
He doesn't have an ounce of hatred in his heart.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.240
I'm sure mine is Pornhub Premium.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.720
It has to be.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.400
Premium as a home page?

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.400
I don't know.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.400
That's urgent.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:01:04.320
It's urgent.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:11.320
So anyways, I mean...

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320
Pictures of men shaving.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.480
Yeah, you at home listening, it's pictures of men shaving because here's the thing about

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:21.440
shaving and women shave, too, and there's no such thing as gender, so this is a commercial

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.720
for humanity.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:31.760
DollarShaveCub.com lets you, the human end user, reach out into the world and use digital

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:39.400
technology to have shaving equipment delivered to your door.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:47.400
It's an unholy union of prehistoric needs and modern fulfillment.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:52.200
If you just go to DollarShaveCub.com slash Harmontown, I believe you'll get a deep, deep

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.200
discount.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.600
You can try, you get a free trial, just pay shipping.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:04.760
Yeah, and they pass the shavings on to you.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.040
I just coined that.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.040
You didn't write that in advance?

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040
No.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:15.760
So whether you have a beard that you don't like, or you have one that you like and you

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:20.360
want to spend some time apart from it, or whether you don't want one and you're afraid

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:27.440
one's about to happen, or whether there's no chance of you having one, but you live

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:33.080
in a part of a patriarchy that demands that other parts of your body be hair free, you

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:37.560
know, like, or maybe, hey, maybe you don't, maybe you're offended by that, maybe you choose

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.080
to be hairless, and it's an expression of yourself.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:45.280
In any case, you got a shave.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:51.640
So why invite the Gillettes and Bix and needless trips to the grocery store into that equation?

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.120
That's not personal, that's not convenient, that's not intimate, and that's certainly

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.480
not millennial.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.880
There's nothing less millennial than trying to break into that locked up razor fortress

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.120
at the drug store.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.040
Yeah, what does that say, like, we want you to have this but we don't trust you with it,

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:13.360
you might hijack the store with a razor, like, oh, you're a terrorist that's going to take

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.080
over the grocery store by having the first blade pressed down the skin and have the

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:23.720
second blade lift, well, the third clips, leaving behind a smooth strip of, that's not

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.360
how terrorism works, and it's not how shaving should work.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.160
And hey, look, I don't know, I'm no expert on capitalism, but I don't think our advertisers

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:38.640
would want us to exclude terrorism from their potential, I mean, I don't know.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.160
I think they might want to exclude them.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.360
I've seen pictures of these guys, they need a shave.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:49.800
You think dollar shave is okay with terrorists buying their razors?

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.200
According to science, as long as they use them to shave, but what I learned in 10th

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:59.120
grade science, the definition of what, we cannot say for sure that their lack of shaving

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.240
is causing them to blow things up.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.360
However, we do not know that there is not a cause-effect relationship until we do an

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.840
experiment, like going to dollarshaveclub.com slash Harmontown, if you are feeling terroristic

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.760
today, look in the mirror, are you beardy?

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:22.520
Do you know for a fact that the beard is not telling you, like, to hate America?

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.080
I don't, I hate America, I don't know what's, I don't know, it could be my beard.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.080
Does your beard tell you to hate America?

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:31.080
I don't know, I don't speak beard, so it doesn't get long enough.

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:34.480
Your beard tells you to hate America?

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:42.960
That's why I chose the executive blade, choose your own blade.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:51.800
So dollarshaveclub.com slash Harmontown, they're going to love that.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:56.680
You know what's fucked up with the society, I typed in man-shaving into Google, there's

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:12.360
got to be 1,000 images here, I bet if you typed liberty, look at that, a statue, it

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:17.400
says so much about where we're at, look at this, it's just a statue, you know, and it's

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:26.200
a French one, what if you typed human rights, oh God, you're going to get people that are

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.680
like, no, no, no, okay, yeah, okay.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.720
Just all these images of humans exercising their rights.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.400
Democracy, there we go, okay, well that's better, it's just the word democracy in a

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.240
lot of signs.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:44.120
Levy, you don't have your trackpad reversed for scrolling?

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:49.080
Fucking get with it, they're not going to change their minds.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.400
As if people that reverse the trackpad are like, I'm holding out, holding out for what?

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:59.320
It's an oligarchy, oligopoly, I think is what I meant to say.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.800
It's an Olly something, man, Olly Olly oxen not free.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.600
But it's his laptop, doesn't he have the right of choice of scrolling direction?

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:13.480
I have the right to share it with him and throw bricks through his window that say, leave

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:19.400
it, I don't have the right to do that.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.640
You're a scrolling Nazi.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.280
I'm a scrolling Nazi.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:25.680
No scroll for you!

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:30.000
What if you type in Irish Seinfeld, what do you get?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.680
This is good.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.600
So this is like family feud.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600
Surveys?

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:43.760
I don't, okay, showing results for Irish Seinfeld, here they come.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:49.920
All right, well, it's the Gramercy, it's a very old classic theater, there we go, Irish

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.880
Seinfeld, that's just Seinfeld.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:57.120
He's a global phenomenon, Irish Seinfeld is Seinfeld.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:00.320
Yeah, okay, that makes sense.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:04.600
Wait, what is this picture, what is this, the cast of Seinfeld in front of the World Trade

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:19.000
Center with an airplane, I mean, it's the cast of Seinfeld in front of the World Trade

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.640
Center with the plane going into it.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.200
Whose page is this?

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:39.720
It's an Irish guy's page, because until we wait for it to come up, the URL is Seinfeld-911-exercise-terrible-bad-taste-funny.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:44.240
Seinfeld does 911 as an exercise in terrible bad taste, but it is very funny.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:49.840
All right, hey, this is a show, I think maybe it's an Ireland, here's a quick extract to

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:55.920
give you the flavor, it nails the, okay, the, hey, by the way, I am so, so sorry about that

01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:03.760
guy that you were seeing, meh, meh, what do you mean meh, he was murdered by terrorists.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:09.520
Yeah, okay, I'm not going to read someone else's comedy.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:15.040
I don't, I don't see this ending well, it's a spec script for Seinfeld, it's a spec

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.040
script for Seinfeld.

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:22.640
It's about Elaine having a boyfriend who dies in 911 and then I'm dealing it, well, I hope

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:28.160
that person's happy, TV's dead, I mean, like, yeah, we're killing it, and by the way, I

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:35.040
just like to say, you know, as the company that brings you the Olympics, fuck, can you,

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.040
can you stop them?

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.040
Can you do something?

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040
I do not have that.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.920
Pull some strings, man, pull some rings.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.000
Why would you want to?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.400
Because they're like, what if I told you that there is a global corporation that just wanted

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:54.040
to extract money through the world by way of pretending some sports mattered?

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.040
Welcome to America, man.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.680
Yeah, I hate it.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:06.520
Do you think sports are a pacification of people that would otherwise murder me, or do you

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.640
think it's encouraging them to keep feeling murdery?

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640
Both.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:17.480
I think sports and other group communal activities help us escape, yeah, absolutely.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:23.160
Imagine sports, you know, I've been an Eagles fan since I was born, basically, yeah.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:29.840
Let's see what happens tomorrow, let's see what happens tomorrow, but I don't, there's

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.800
not a rational, I don't have a rational reason for rooting for the Eagles, I've lived in

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:41.600
New York 27 years, and they suck most of the time, or they break my heart every year, and

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.800
yet I keep going back.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:49.800
I'm sorry, I typed my name into Google, they're excited.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.800
You're Googling yourself?

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.400
Yeah, which I haven't done in a long time.

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.920
What's the first thing that comes up?

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.240
Well, there's, oh, it looks like you purchased a little ad here.

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.240
Now that's an ad.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:06.080
Dan Harmon, my Wikipedia page, there's my Twitter, I'm Dan Harmon, my AMA, Dan Harmon

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:12.120
poops my outdated blog, my story structure, wow, it used to be Dan Harmon's, what's that?

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.160
Click on that Twitter rant, what's that about it?

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.920
Dan Harmon's angry, abusive Twitter rant, that doesn't sound like you.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.600
That's a year ago, that's a year ago.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:25.080
Makes him seem deeply unhappy.

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:28.520
File this one under comedy with two question marks.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.000
First off, none of this is safe for work in any way.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I don't know.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
That's not true.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.200
But here we are printing it, because if you scroll down, you will be reading some language

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.680
in italics.

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.920
Language is not the burden of not safe for work at all.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.280
Who's like looking at, oh, that text is naughty.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.280
You are fired, mister.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.480
Second off, if you worship Dan Harmon, creator of Community in Rick and Morty, you might

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:57.800
want to stop here, because even your fellow Harmon worshipers think it makes him look

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.920
really small.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:05.840
The story here is that Harmon was on a plane yesterday, possibly drunk, and someone insulted

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.840
him on Twitter.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.920
This happens to famous people all the time.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.320
It even happens to non-famous people all the time.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.640
Twitter is essentially a cauldron of self-promotion links and insults, and there is no escape.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.800
Dan Harmon has surely been insulted on Twitter before.

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.200
It's part of the shitty bargain.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.680
This time, though, something's not.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.880
This time.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:32.240
He caved to a dark desire to, quote, inflict genuine pain, unquote.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:36.680
Unfortunately, his nemesis has protected all his or her tweets, so we can't see the original

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.680
spark.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:41.160
But Harmon's responses tell us plenty all by themselves.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.560
Update, from the comments, here's the unforgivable incendiary tweet that set Harmon out.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.560
Oh, shit.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.080
Okay, I guess you're drunker than expected.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.000
That's okay, but this isn't that great of an idea.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.400
Oh, yeah, that's a fucking shitty person.

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.600
Who would respond to a tweet like that?

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.840
Okay, I guess you're drunk, but whatever, not a good idea.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:06.560
Fuck you, let the pain begin.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:12.480
I barely remember this, but I'm now re-mad at that guy.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:17.720
So I said, by the way, going through a divorce, fucking a drunk, I'm on a plane, fuck you.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.440
My Twitter, my internet, my planet.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.960
I'm fucking Dan Harmon, I'm not a goddamn politician.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:29.560
Those people are terrible fucking people, I'm not running for election, fuck you.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.720
Don't talk to me shitty, you're gonna get talked to shitty back if I'm in a bad mood.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:37.480
It happens every day, every day, it happens every day.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.480
Even the non-famous people.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.840
I'm not a fucking senator, man, like fuck you, fuck all of you.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:43.920
So fucking mad.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.360
And then these days people who are sober right now.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:51.920
There's so sitting politicians that do much worse and it's not a problem at all, like

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.880
they're like, oh, let's stop minorities from voting.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.880
Well, that's true.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.880
I mean, there's been politicians threatening other politicians.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:01.880
Yeah, I didn't get drunk and get on a plane and say, I have an idea, all Mexicans are

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.880
rapists, let's build a wall around America.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.880
Right.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:09.040
Like that would be like, well, Dan Harmon got drunk the other day and revealed that he's

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.400
a fucking racist and a Nazi, and I thought, like, no, Dan Harmon got drunk and revealed

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.360
something he reveals when he's sober, which is that he's a dick and you shouldn't fuck

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360
with him.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:22.960
Like, he was just more in the mood to fuck with you back than to play cookie collector.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:27.680
I'm sure this was pre cookie collector, right?

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.720
So I don't know, I just, all I did, I Kevin Spacey the guy, like I just leaned into him

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.640
and like fucking let him have it.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.840
Is there a wrap up?

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:36.840
There's a wrap.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:43.440
Oh, it goes on from there and you can revisit the whole debacle at Harmon's Twitter feed

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.200
slash Dollar Shave Club if you want to discount.

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:51.560
The interesting thing here, oh, is it interesting is that his victim's Twitter handle was Bird

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.360
Person, which is a Rick and Morty character.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:57.960
So he's at least nominally a Harmon fan.

01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:58.960
Nominally?

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.000
Well, if they follow you on Twitter, I mean, they're already at least nominally a fan of

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
yours.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Oh, yeah.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.480
Every single person that says shitty stuff to me is always following me.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:11.480
Every person that always says, hey, shut up, you're fat and you're drunk and you're stupid

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.920
and no one cares about your opinion.

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:17.280
I always go over in the midst of blocking them and right next to the block button is a fucking

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.640
following you icon.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.560
And I always want to go like, this is insane.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.240
If you're fucking, you wonder why I'm leaving behind a planet that is going to burn into

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.240
a cinder.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:30.320
Well, but Twitter's just become a bit masochistic.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.880
You follow people so that you can get angry at them so that you can evoke some kind of

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.880
reaction.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:35.880
Oh, yeah.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:36.880
And that's all fine.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.880
That's all fair play.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.800
I have never in my life like tried to ban somebody or complain or be like, what's going

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.800
on on Twitter?

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.280
This is not, this should be illegal.

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.280
Somebody should shut PETA down.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.760
I don't suffer the illusion that my problems are the problems of the fucking society around

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:50.760
me.

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:51.760
I don't wait for anybody to fix my shit.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.760
I just like, if somebody says, fuck you, I'm like, no, fuck you, probably, maybe.

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.760
But do you...

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.400
If I'm coming out of therapy, I'm like, thank you, like for five minutes.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.640
I'm like, oh, yeah, maybe I should fuck me, I guess, it's a good point.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.000
I won't side with the split.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.600
I should engage in some self-care.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.000
I'm going to go shower now.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:15.240
But do you, have you ever posted something in one of these that you regret?

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.320
He regretted this for a while, then he stopped.

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:21.000
Well, I regretted the whole experience, but that's different from remorse, like where

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.480
you're like, I feel, I shouldn't have done that.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:29.560
Like I don't know, I still forgive myself for, I'm a human being that's on Twitter.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:37.640
Remorse is like, I really acknowledge my crime and I fucking like, I feel terrible that happened.

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:40.360
Regret is like, oh shit, that turned into a shit storm.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.800
If I went back in time, I'd avoid it because it didn't profit anybody.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:50.040
I don't know, fine line, but remorse involves this person that started this shit, not feeling

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:53.880
like a piece of shit, and I'm not willing to go to that world yet.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.120
I don't care if they're 15, I don't care if they have one arm, I don't fucking care,

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.320
they're a dick.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:05.720
And an encounter with me and their brush with fame that resulted from it changes their perspective

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.880
on society's construction, then I've either done a favor or contributed to their fucking

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:12.200
gross soup that is our society.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.400
And in either case, mwah.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:19.640
They're probably proud of that moment though, they probably have that thing framed on their

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.640
wall somewhere.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.680
So, the conclusion is, so what the hell just happened?

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:29.040
You're the journalist, obviously we witnessed an incredible explosion of insecurity, narcissism

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:35.520
and anger from a man who is both creatively talented, thank you, see that's a, these are

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.080
my worst enemies and they still call me talented, that's the fucking best.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.720
I've never had like, nobody ever, everyone's like, that talented guy is an asshole, I'm

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:47.000
like, boom, mwah.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:53.240
Ah, I can't, it's both creatively talented and insanely thin skinned, oh heaven for

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:58.040
fend that I'd be receptive and have fucking empathy, more than anything my takeaway is

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:03.920
that Dan Harmon is deeply unhappy, I love a good trolling, but this flew beyond that

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:08.880
category within like, three tweets, hopefully this is a passing moment of counterproductive

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.800
chest thumping for Harmon and not the start of an emotional breakdown that ends with him

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.120
smashing into walls in an asylum.

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.120
Ah, shit.

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:27.760
I mean, so that, what are we, that's, orwelling in to say that, hopefully this person being

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:33.200
publicly vulnerable on social media and the resulting clickbait articles talking about

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.120
how he's having a meltdown don't result in government intervention.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:43.000
Are you fine, someone should shut PETA down, dude, someone started PETA so you'd say that,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.920
they're already doing their job, go start anti PETA, do something, you fucking schmuck.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.400
Like what the fuck, man, stop reading.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.400
Let's read the comments.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.400
Oh.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.400
Alright, comments.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:18:00.720
Here's a screenshot of the pretty innocuous original tweet, but yeah, we already said

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:01.720
that.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.240
Oh, so they didn't research that, someone posted it in the comment and they updated it.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.240
That's what they said.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.240
I hate this shit, man.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.200
This is an article that's literally just someone's tweets and then some, it's like

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.760
if I told you about something that happened on Twitter and then got paid 100 bucks for

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:13.760
it.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.120
But this person's talking about the person responding, by the way, I never read a single

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.120
response from this person.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.000
Apparently they said English wasn't their first language and they apologized how they

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.360
came across, I didn't read anything from them.

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:28.240
I was like, I was just typing 140 characters at a time about how they were a piece of shit.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.240
Jesus, that poor kid.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:31.240
Meh.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.960
I don't know, man.

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:37.480
They definitely said they were sick parents, you are worthless, but this person's quoting

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.480
me.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:42.200
You are worthless, but necessary byproduct of an evolutionary strategy summarizable as

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.000
no wrong answers.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.320
To which this person responds, bleh.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.720
Good one.

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.320
Dan fancies himself some sort of insulting savant, but the only jab I found particularly

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.840
inspired was your pistons are generic fears.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.040
La di da.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:06.680
Is that the Roger Ebert of insults?

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:10.840
I am Sarah Silverman's complete lack of surprise.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:27.320
Okay, Dan Harmon has quite a few personality disorders, apparently stemming from an abusive

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:33.240
childhood, he is also an alcoholic and perhaps even a drug addict.

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:37.320
And although he is a creative genius, fuck an egg.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.560
These are my enemies.

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:47.800
That would be like if during the debates, like Hillary Clinton was like, okay, I get

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:53.520
it, he'd make a great president, but still, I win.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.760
Pouring his pain and dysfunctions into his work, if you are familiar with his work, you

01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:59.800
will notice how many of his characters are projections of either himself, his hopes or

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.800
his fears.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:07.120
What a shallow bag of tricks.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:12.000
His process is very uneven, although this person may be defending me.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.440
His process is very uneven and because of his, I believe this is probably Todd Vanderwerf

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:19.360
from The Onion, an anonymous account.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:23.480
His process is very uneven and because of his many issues, he is very hard to work with,

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:25.920
okay, here we go.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.520
Having constant breakdowns and anxiety attacks and being plain abusive to the point that

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:37.000
his now ex-wife, Erin, was more a caregiver and handler than a spouse and partner in the

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.440
traditional sense.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:42.880
So no surprise that she finally called it quits because you can only take so much abuse.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.320
And that's the point that sad little trolls like Joffrey who feel the need to use the

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:50.880
name of one of the most hated D-bags in all the fandoms because he thinks it gives him

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.720
some sort of Reddit street cred, wait, I don't even know who they are talking about now.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:01.120
Am I Joffrey or is the person that tweeted me Joffrey, I got to back up.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:05.760
So no surprise that she finally called it quits because you can only take so much abuse

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:10.240
and that's the point that sad little trolls like Joffrey who feel the need to use the

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:14.480
same, who feel the need to use the name of one of the most hated D-bags in all of the

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:20.080
fandoms because he thinks it gives him some sort of Reddit street cred but in fact only

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.880
shows how desperate for attention they are.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:22.880
Don't get.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:29.680
Don't stop poking Dan Harmon because you think him slapping you is attention that will make

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.680
you happy.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:31.680
It won't.

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:35.240
There are people who are assholes because they choose to or because they are too lame.

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:40.400
This person can't spell for shit to be something better and then there are people who are assholes

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:44.600
because they suffer from mental illness, personality disorders and have a ton of real fucked up

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:45.840
issues to deal with.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:46.840
Thank you.

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:51.520
These are the people that can barely function, I don't know.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.880
And if you inform yourselves a little bit about Dan Harmon, you will realize he is one

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:57.440
of said people.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:06.080
He is barely functional, he is a sick person that happens to be a creative genius.

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:10.160
If not, he would probably be living on the streets like so many untreated addicts of

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:13.880
mental patients and all the people who don't get that are just a fucking ignorant, cruel

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:17.640
reflection of how our society treats people with social disorders, mental illness, personality

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:22.040
disorders and drug addiction by punishing them, humiliating them, like they chose to

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.040
be that way.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.040
Like they are very existent.

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:27.480
Did I write this?

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:34.040
Was I so drunk that I logged in and I was like, why do you keep... I should be on the

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.920
streets if you hate me so much.

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:39.600
Like they are very existent, it's annoying to them and they should just get over their

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.440
issues to make your selfish lives better.

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.880
Dan Harmon is an asshole, but at least he has medical issues to explain why he is this

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:50.000
way.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.080
Just to make all the jealous hatters feel better, feel better, hatters feel better in

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:59.360
their hadding ways.

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360
I wrote this.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:09.240
That's my red herring, like I will spell a couple of things wrong, I'm like, I'll just

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:12.120
throw a couple of extra T's in here.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:16.200
In their hadding ways, he lives in constant pain and anxiety.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:21.160
I must be an expert at deflecting it because I'm fucking deliriously happy.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:24.840
He is a very unhappy lonely man that hurts and pushes away everyone around him because

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:28.920
that's just how fucked up he is that he can't have a basic normal healthy relationship and

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:36.240
sooner or later he is going to self-destruct while the world watches and I think that will

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.320
be at the Gramercy Theater at 4 p.m.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.040
Signed Steve Levy.

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:47.800
I bet if we check that IP address it comes right from inside my house, it's Steve Levy.

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:50.320
It's coming from inside the house.

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:55.880
Yeah, I don't, I mean, it's, what, so, okay, I mean, like, what do you mean?

01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:00.160
I'm a creative genius, I'm not functional, I'm functioning so well that you're talking

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.600
about me for eight pages in a comment section.

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:04.640
I called you a creative genius twice though.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:09.200
And I'm functioning so highly that you're fucking, like, writing more than I am.

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.840
Like, I'm getting paid for obscene amounts of money to self-destruct and this is more

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:19.120
than I've written all week.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:24.440
I didn't do this much on Dr. Strange.

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:27.040
I just went in there and ate a pizza and was like, yeah, it's cool, he's kind of like

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:33.200
Rick.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.520
Let's not forget Harmon's the first stages of a divorce.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:38.680
That's true, okay, so here's the thing, I mean, I want to make sure and clarify, like,

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.040
I'm not, like, I very much explained that before that Twitter thing and I never looked

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.040
at the kid's responses.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.040
I wasn't talking to him.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:50.080
I very clearly said, this guy caught me at the wrong time, I'm fucking, and my therapist

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:54.560
had warned me and she said, people that are going through divorce, like, it doesn't matter

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:57.560
the circumstances of the divorce, it doesn't matter, fair or unfair, it's like, it's such

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:05.120
a, it, like, raises up your, like, weird, you become hyper-vigilant about injustice,

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:09.840
so you'll just, like, anything that seems unfair to you, you'll just, like, freak out

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:13.920
whether it's unfair to people in a corner talking, like, and then I went and experienced

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:19.360
it and I was like, this is what's happening, like, I'm, like, this person's going to get

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.880
a beat down because they disagreed with me, they told me and I'm like, I need to inflict

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:24.880
pain right now.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:29.000
And then I just, I tweeted a bunch of stuff, I don't know the person, so how can I possibly

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
be hurtful?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.440
I'm the non-anonymous one, I'm the one that everyone gets to call fat and alcoholic and

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:38.280
abusive, like, this person's like an expert at my marriage and they're just walking away

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.200
clean, they can write all that and they're mentally healthy.

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.400
This person is a fucking, like, this person's a therapist, right?

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.280
This person's in charge of how other people should feel and their response to a stranger

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:55.000
on Twitter having a bad day is that my wife had to feed me pudding because I'm, like,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.440
that's fucking rude and judgmental and if I tweeted something like that at somebody else,

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.800
it would be incredibly petty and everyone would be like, Dan Harmon attacks Vince Gilligan

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:08.760
and invokes his divorce, you know, like, you think breaking bad is so good, how come your

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:09.760
marriage sucks?

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.480
It would be like the end of my career, it would be the end of my career because it wouldn't

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:18.480
just be me going like, fuck you, fuck you, people are gross jerks, I'm in a fucking,

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:21.800
I'm in a bad mood, everyone's a piece of shit asshole, I'm just like Hannibal Lecter, I'm

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:28.840
locked in a cell, all I can do is talk about fava beans, I can't, like, eat you, quid pro

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:32.440
quo, Clarice.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:37.200
If you listen to me and work with me, I will direct you to a storage unit that will solve

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.760
a lot of your case for you.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:44.840
There is a place where a guy for some reason is storing a head in a jar.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:49.040
Conspiracy carrot, the voice of a generation.

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:59.400
Look at this guy, community sucked shit-flavored dick.

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:06.920
That's like the, that is like the Parks and Rec of insults of community.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.080
What's more amazing to me is how anyone can go anywhere on the Internet and not flip out

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.080
like this.

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:13.360
Oh, I love you Ben Hinman, eight months ago.

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.360
Ben Hinman?

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.360
That sounds familiar.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:16.360
Oh.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.360
No, I was, it sounds a lot like Dan Harmon.

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.360
Oh.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:27.400
Wait, did I spend the whole show, what am I, what's, Steve Levy's clock says 223, does

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.400
that mean, oh, does that mean-

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:29.400
It's time for a wrap.

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:30.400
We got a wrap.

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:40.240
All right, Mary Houlihan, how can people walking away from this go experience more cockney

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:47.760
and more reserved but polite and possibly very cool, assuredly funny and smart because

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:50.560
you're on Feral Audio, shenanigans.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:56.840
You can follow me on the web at Mary Huli, H-O-U-L-I-E.

01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:04.320
You may also listen to my new podcast and you may also go to a comedy show I do.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:10.480
It's called Cartoon Monsoon and it's every first Friday of the month at Annoyance Theater.

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:20.920
All right, Mary Houlihan, Evan Shapiro, what do you have to plug, Dollar Shave Club?

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:24.040
Yeah, well I could use a shave right now actually.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.640
No, I'll plug Harmon Quest.

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.920
It's up right now.

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:37.600
And we just put ten new chapters of the expanded universe up there which has extra stuff that

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:43.720
we didn't get into, did not shave to it.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:50.120
But it includes extra stuff with Paul F. Tompkins and Nathan Fillion and a whole bunch of other

01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:51.120
great people.

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:53.440
Do you have a favorite one of these deleted moments?

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:58.280
I think the scene that got taken out of the wrestling match with Paul F. Tompkins from

01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:59.280
the first episode.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.280
It's been so long though.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:06.080
I like the Aubrey Plaza, I think her introduction piece, I could turn it into something else.

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:08.720
It's like some really funny stuff.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:11.240
There's so much funny stuff that we had to cut out of that one.

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.240
Yeah, the Aubrey Plaza episode.

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:13.240
Hawaiian coffee.

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:16.480
It's my favorite because it's like real time.

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:19.560
That's kind of what I pictured when I thought about playing D&D and animating it is the

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:25.760
fact that D&D, Pathfinder, Pathfinder, Pathfinder, Pathfinder, Pathfinder, the fact that fantasy

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:32.720
role playing is often, it's people arguing about how to open a door and it's like hilarious.

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:33.720
I did it.

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:34.720
I did it.

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:35.720
All right.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:36.720
Great.

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.720
Cool.

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:38.720
And that's all up.

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:42.280
You can get it on any device, iPhone, Android, CISO.com.

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:43.280
Xbox one.

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:44.280
Yeah.

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:45.280
Xbox.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:46.280
Yeah.

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.280
And if you sign up right now, you get a month free.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:50.040
So you can watch all of Harmon Quest and all of the expanded universe for free and then

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.040
maybe stick around.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.040
Give me a beat.

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:57.040
I don't think they're ready.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:02.040
Are you guys ready?

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.040
Yeah.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.040
I guess I was mistaken.

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.040
They're ready.

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.040
Yeah.

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:07.040
Yeah.

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:08.040
Yeah.

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.040
Give it to them.

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.040
Yeah.

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.040
Yeah.

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.040
Yeah.

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.040
Yeah.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.040
New York.

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.040
103rd Street.

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.040
Below it.

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.040
102nd.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.040
That's where I like to meet my bagels and coffee and hot chocolate.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:25.040
I front your mama until she said, stop it, and then I stopped.

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.040
Immediately.

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:27.040
Open communication.

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:38.040
I took a taxi and not an Uber because the medallion system is, is McRuber.

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.040
Will Forte.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:45.040
I went to the Statue of Liberty to stop a torch.

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.040
Forge.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.040
Word.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:52.040
Street to street and train to train.

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.040
The subways are below.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.040
Like Lois Lane.

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.040
She's not below Superman.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:59.040
She's below a patriarchy glass ceiling, man.

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:03.040
She should be the editor of that paper by now.

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:08.040
I'm with her.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:13.040
Lois Lane has more superpowers than Superman because she earned them by the hour.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:17.040
She disciplined herself and she went to school in an age when people took her for a fool

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:22.040
because she had no penis where there's just a hole.

01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.040
Daily Planet.

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:24.040
Lois Lane.

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:25.040
Metropolis.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.040
Is it a plane?

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:27.040
No.

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.040
It's Lois Lane.

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:29.040
Is it a plane?

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.040
No.

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.040
No.

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.040
It's Lois Lane.

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.040
Higher than an eagle.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.040
Faster than a train.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.040
Motherfucker, look at Lois Lane.

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:39.040
She got two big titties and a journalist degree.

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.040
Sorry about that.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.040
Keep it going.

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:47.040
Move past it.

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:50.040
She's resistant to objectification.

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:53.040
It's her superpower.

01:31:53.040 --> 01:32:00.040
She doesn't have a kryptonite because she's grown in a world that tried to hold her down.

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:04.040
She's more like zoom's dead than that regard.

01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:11.040
Aquaman always gets beef because he talks to fish and coral reefs.

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:16.040
Green lantern.

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:19.040
Whoa.

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:22.040
His kryptonite is the color yellow.

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:23.040
And wood.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.040
It used to be wood.

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.040
Dumb.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.040
Fucking dumb.

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.040
So dumb.

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:29.040
I'm here.

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:35.040
I can help by making anything as long as it's green.

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:42.040
Make it green Superman and take over the world with fucking dipshit.

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.040
All right.

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.040
New York.

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.040
100 Fifth Street.

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.040
100 Avenue.

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.040
Alphabet City.

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.040
That's what I'm going to do.

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.040
My pinky is satin island.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.040
So I'm going to stick it up like a little finger.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.040
And all of the rocks.

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:59.040
I'm curling up with a fist and I punch you.

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.040
Because I'm New York.

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:03.040
If you're a terrorist, I mean I'm going to punch you if you're a New Yorker.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:04.040
Because I love New York.

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:06.040
The fist is going to punch terrorism.

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.040
I hate 9-11.

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:10.040
I hate 9-11.

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.040
Never forget.

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.040
I hate 9-11.

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.040
I hate it more than everyone else can.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.040
It's 9-11.

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:18.040
9-11 happened here.

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.040
I hate it.

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.040
And I don't fear 9-12.

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.040
Bring it on.

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:24.040
You're going to make it.

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.040
You're going to find out it can't happen.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:30.040
I hate 9-11.

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.040
Below 6th Street you get a nice donut.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.040
You get some coffee and then you will not wake up.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.040
If it's a good donut.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:39.040
Okay, starting over.

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.040
I go in the subway.

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:41.040
I connect the orange to the red.

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.040
I take the red line and I wake up.

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.040
Instead of going to 3rd Street, go below 4th.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.040
If I want a good cup of coffee.

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.040
But you got to get it from the pizza dough from the other place.

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.040
Because they bring the water from Toronto or something.

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:57.040
Bring it home.

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.040
Jimmy, you're weary.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.040
You're a huddled masses.

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.040
I fucked your mama in all the classes.

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.040
I fucked her so hard the bitch needs glasses.

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:06.040
She's myopic now.

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:09.040
And I gave her some grasses.

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:12.040
I tried to bring it home and I fucked it up.

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.040
That was great.

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:16.040
Here we go.

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.040
City to city.

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.040
Coast to coast.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:20.040
I fucked your mama.

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.040
Like fresh toast.

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.040
Put syrup on her.

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.040
Gave her some eggs.

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.040
I had to do it when I saw her legs.

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:29.040
But I liked her for her personality.

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.040
Alright, fuck it.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.040
Wait, okay.

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:38.040
Pedophiles are bad.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:40.040
Okay, I feel that flow.

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:45.040
Don't fuck kids.

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.040
They're too young.

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:50.040
That's our show, everybody. Good night.

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:52.040
Thank you so much.

01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:54.040
Thank you, Mabel.

01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:56.040
Thank you to Evan Shapiro.

01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:58.040
Thank you to Mary Hulan.

01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.040
Thank you to the Gramercy Theater

01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:02.040
and everyone who helped us put on the show.

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.040
Thanks to you.

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:07.040
Alright, Harmontown is out of session.

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.040
Try fans that take chances.

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:11.040
No.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:37.040
Alright, see you soon.

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:42.040
Feral audio.
