{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:21.000\nWelcome Brits Town, from the Brits Town Comedy Festival in Portland, Oregon, Harmontown,\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:40.000\njust now in such a... Oh yeah. Please welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:40.000 --> 01:07.000\nHello, thank you. Thank you. Oh, family. Thank you. Jeff, when you warm up the crowd when we go to Portland,\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:12.000\nand you talk about how great Portland is, and you ask him how long they've been in Portland,\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:18.000\nwhat do you think I'm going to talk to them about? You're doing my act. I don't have an act. I don't do magic tricks.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:26.000\nThat was half my act. I love Portland. I'm glad you're warmed up, but now I got nothing.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:32.000\nPortland can bear both of our love, Dan. Oh, it can. It can bear everybody's. It's a wonderful town.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:37.000\nWhat's your favorite thing about Portland, Oregon? I love the feeling of ass-kiss exhaustion.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:47.000\nOf loving a city so much that you get mad. Fucking fuck Portland. Every time Aaron and I come here,\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:52.000\nwe extend our stay by a couple more days, because we're constantly, like I'm sure every person from Los Angeles\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:59.000\ntalks about moving here, I'm sure. We have to be typical. And so we keep staying here longer and longer,\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:06.000\nbecause we just want to get mad at something. We've got to find out what these people are bad at.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:15.000\nWhat are you bad at? Parallel parking. Parallel parking. Okay. I'll believe it.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:19.000\nWhat is the worst thing about being in Portland? Is there a thing that you guys are known for being shitty at\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:28.000\nbesides parallel parking? Merging? Asshole drivers. Passive aggression. It's very interesting.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:36.000\nSome girl pointed at somebody else that's passive aggression.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:44.000\nPassive aggression when they nod their head, like, tell them, Kevin, what do you mean?\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:51.000\nFucking Kevin, he's the worst. Your yogurt shop that won't let anyone in unless they turn off their phone.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:59.000\nYou guys love yogurt still, right? It's still 1993. And Seattle. If there's anything,\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:04.000\nI'm telling you now, I'm kind of a Portland expert in one degree, because I want to ask that,\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:10.000\nbecause I'm only ever walking around your town. So four or five visits to Portland, I feel comfortable saying\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:17.000\ntheir homeless population is very distinct. And it's not, like in San Francisco, the homeless population is like,\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:23.000\nI think they're Mad Max homeless people, because who doesn't want to be a homeless guy in San Francisco?\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:30.000\nIt's high stakes. So they're actually people who could own homes here or in LA.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:35.000\nWhen you become homeless, you want to be in San Francisco so that you feel less homeless.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:41.000\nSo the homeless people in San Francisco have garbage can lids for vests.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:47.000\nAnd they have like gimmicks, like they do card tricks. It's a fucking racket, man. It's like a full time job.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:51.000\nI was walking down the road here on Eastburnside, and is that where we are, right?\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nThank you. Wow.\n\n03:53.000 --> 04:00.000\nThey're sharp. It's 4pm, by the way. We're not going to be funny at 4pm, but you guys are going to be very, like, on your shit.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:03.000\nI'm on three cups of coffee. Yep, yep, yep, yep.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:08.000\nThe comedy rule is that nothing's funny when the sun's out, but we're in Portland, so the sun's never out.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:15.000\nI was walking up the road just right here by Sizzle Pie, and there were two just good and proper homeless dudes.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:22.000\nLike, there were two guys hanging out, like, kind of middle-aged white guys that looked like your proper art department winos.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nAnd I was...\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nThey're very well-designed homeless people you guys have here.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nThey have, like, cool tattoos, dogs.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:33.000\nWe got Steve Agee laughing like the Phantom of the Opera up here.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:38.000\nOh, no!\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nI thought you were dead!\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nI forgot we got...\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:55.000\nI was walking down the road to go get some Sizzle Pie, which I quite enjoy, and these two guys were sitting there in a doorway, like, lurking,\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:58.000\nand just, like, kind of supine and sharing a beer.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:04.000\nAnd a guy started to, like, gesture to me and say something, and under normal circumstances,\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nthat would be, uh, brother, can you spare a dime?\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nHave you got any spare change, kind of stuff?\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nHe goes, nice coat, man.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nOh, my God!\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:16.000\nHe didn't want shit! He wanted to fucking enjoy my coat.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nI've been getting that for three days!\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:21.000\nI was, Aaron got me this At-At shirt for the Star Wars At-At shirt.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:25.000\nAnd the whole, maybe, okay, so they're faking it, because they're like, cool shirt, bro.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:28.000\nWait, wait, were they just here in the doorway, just on the block right here?\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:33.000\nWell, everywhere. No, multiple homeless people loved my At-At shirt.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:36.000\nNo, they didn't. They're Portland homeless people.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:39.000\nAnd you guys are secretly vain.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nAnd they are, this is the biosphere.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nWe're just learning this now.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:47.000\nThey're, like, living on the methane of this ocean floor, because there's no sun,\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:51.000\nso they're like, okay, compliment their hair on their shirt.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:55.000\nThat's the difference between a Portland homeless guy that lives to see a homeless tomorrow.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nEven the homeless people are passive-aggressive here.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:03.000\nWow, a nice, expensive coat you've got there.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:04.000\nBut I saw it.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:10.000\nI guess I'll just sit here in the shade and, like, be in a puddle for the rest of my life.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nThey're more packed up, too, though. They're less solo.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:16.000\nI'm gonna strike out a theory that just from the, I'm sure you guys are sick of being characterized\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:21.000\nas, like, wonderfuls and people and, like, liberal and wonderful and nurturing.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nThere's probably some small part of you that's driving home at night and going,\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:28.000\nlike, why don't out of towners just understand that I'm fucked up, too?\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:32.000\nJust because I can hold a city together doesn't mean I'm a fucking,\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:37.000\nI'm this highway to heaven for you when you're coming out of town.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:42.000\nBut I'm telling you guys, to the extent that you are Portland,\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:47.000\nI mean, you guys are pretty infuriatingly cool and hard to upset.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nYou're very nice to out of towners.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:54.000\nBut there was a guy, I don't know if I can even, I have no idea if he was homeless,\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:57.000\nbut he was definitely strange.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:01.000\nHe was a middle-aged guy and he was holding a skateboard.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:02.000\nI immediately wrote this down.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:06.000\nThe last time I was in Portland, I feel like I had an encounter that I had to immediately write down\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nbecause, like, they asked for money.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nI would have to scroll back through our backlog because I told the story.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nThey asked for a couple of years ago.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nThey asked for money, and I think I gave them money,\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nand then they said, thank you, we're crackheads.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:23.000\nAnd then some weird, like, kind of flourish.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nLike, you got to be careful out here.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nI can't remember what it was, but anyways.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nBut I remember writing it down and presenting it to the show.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nAnd then again, it happened because this middle-aged guy who's like,\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:39.000\nhad like a kind of riff-raff from Rocky Horror kind of hair style,\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:43.000\nand he was holding a skateboard and he was dressed in like,\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nwith like heavy metal kind of like fan,\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nlike a heavy metal concert goer kind of clothes,\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nbut like also kind of fucked up like he's been,\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nhe's seen a couple nights under a bridge,\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:55.000\nbut he's holding a skateboard and had the riff-raff hair,\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nand was like my age, and as we passed each other,\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nwhen I was eight feet from him, he said,\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:02.000\ndo you have a cigarette?\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nSo I had four feet to say, no, I don't, sorry.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:09.000\nAnd then as he passed me, even though neither of us slowed down,\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:13.000\nhe said, do you have any Mortal Kombat stuff?\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nPlease tell me you said yes.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nWell, I have to stress though that it was like,\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nthen I was four feet, there were eight feet apart,\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nand I just, but commenced 30 years of head scratching,\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:34.000\nthat'll never, this is why I need to believe in God,\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:37.000\nbecause I need to believe that these moments will be explained to me.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:40.000\nThat guy, he was, he was, he wanted to,\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nhe had, he was, he just got kicked out of his place,\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:45.000\nand he had a bag full of Mortal Kombat like stuff,\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nand he just wanted to tell you stuff, and I'm like, oh good.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:51.000\nAnd then God says like, plus you had eight spiders in your mouth.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nAny more trivia you want to know?\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nYes, like lots of stuff, like you could spend 500 years\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\nanalyzing the 57 years I'm going to be here.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:01.000\nI got in the car from my hotel, or my hotel,\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:04.000\nlike a decent walk from here,\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nand I was getting a ride over here,\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:09.000\nand there was a guy on the road carrying a skateboard,\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nand I think it was a guy because he looked like me\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:13.000\nif he had a skateboard.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nIf I was walking down the street with a skateboard\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nand wasn't wearing a suit, my height,\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nmy kind of haircut, like my build,\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:23.000\nand yet, perfect tits.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:26.000\nIt was a guy, it was clearly a guy,\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:30.000\nand he had like beautiful bouncing boobs in his shirts,\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nand he was just cruising down the road with a skateboard.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:36.000\nI'm like, that's a good town.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nThis is Jeff Davis with delicious double D\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nis walking down the road.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.000\nThat's specific enough that that guy's probably listening,\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nI think, I know.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:49.000\nSo, call in.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nI want to, speaking of reaching out to specific fans\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nand wondering things, I had a strange,\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.000\nbecause I caught myself doing something so odd today.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:00.000\nI know that there's differently abled Harmontown fans,\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nI don't know if there's any here tonight,\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:07.000\nbut specifically wheelchair using folk.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nThat's the term, right?\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nNailed it.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:15.000\nI'm so frightened of everything now.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:19.000\nIt expresses itself so much more, the bigot sounding,\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nwheelchair using folk.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:26.000\nYou're great, you're Eleanoldo, you're nailing it.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:29.000\nI passed a guy in a wheelchair,\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:32.000\nand I caught myself, this was the first time in 42 years,\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nI was conscious of my behavior,\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:37.000\nbecause I wonder if any differently abled Harmonians,\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:40.000\nhave you ever, do you constantly experience something\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:44.000\nthat I would call the wheelchair smile?\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.000\nFrom non-differently abled people?\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:50.000\nBecause I made this weird face,\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:56.000\nlike this very polite kind of like,\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nI was like, what did I mean by that face?\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:03.000\nLike, nice wheelchair, what did I mean?\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:04.000\nWhat does that face mean?\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nAnd I wonder if people that are bound...\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:07.000\nNice spokes.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nYeah, like what does that face mean?\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nI bet it makes them feel like living ghosts,\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nand makes them very upset,\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nbecause it's not a natural face,\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nwhy can't you just see me as a human being?\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:19.000\nYou fat piece of shit.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.000\nWelcome to Portland.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nI'm the only angry person in Portland.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nDan, let's say, God forbid,\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:28.000\nthat you had some accident or some debilitating illness that made you...\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:31.000\nSooner than it will inevitably happen, yes.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nThat you were wheelchair bound,\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:36.000\nand you were going down the road or here in a crowd,\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nwhat look would you like to get from other people?\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\nWell, obviously I would like...\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:40.000\nI mean, it's not a funny answer,\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:43.000\nbut I would like no look, I would like...\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nWe all remember...\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nWell, we don't all remember, you're 22.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:49.000\nThe...\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:50.000\nThis was the 80s definition.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:51.000\nI've referenced this before.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:55.000\nThe 80s definition of political correctness was on different strokes\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nwhen Arnold was introduced to a kid in a wheelchair.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nEvery sitcom back then had one episode about a kid in a wheelchair,\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:05.000\nand I think they got money from London or something if they did it.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:08.000\nIt's the handicapped capital of the world.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nNone of this makes sense.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nIt's four in the afternoon, I'm already drunk.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nSuffer through this.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:17.000\nHey, Avalon, hey, how are you doing, buddy?\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nLet's talk about Avalon in a second.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:25.000\nAnd then we'll have guests, and we'll do a show.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nArnold Jackson, that was his name,\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nGary Coleman's character in different strokes.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nHe befriends a kid in a wheelchair,\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nand they have like a play date.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nAnd then he...\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nI think Arnold refuses the call to adventure.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nHe's like, I don't want to be friends with a guy in a wheelchair.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:40.000\nThat's uncomfortable.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.000\nAnd then the road to trials is like they share action figures or something,\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nand they're like making friends.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:47.000\nAnd then Arnold says, like, come on, I want to show you my goldfish.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:48.000\nLet's go upstairs.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:51.000\nAnd he runs up the stairs and then stops halfway up the stairs\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nand turns back around and looks at the kid in the wheelchair and says,\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:57.000\nI'm sorry, I forgot you were...\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:01.000\nAnd then the kid in the wheelchair, like half for the narrative\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:06.000\nand mostly for the planet, like goes, Arnold, that's the nicest thing\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:10.000\nanyone's ever said to me.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nAnd the audience applauds instead of laughing,\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:18.000\nwhich is how you know it's the 80s when a sitcom could get a pause\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:21.000\nfor not being funny.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nBecause it's like, there were three channels\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:28.000\nand it was a secretly socialist, like, fascist regime.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nIt was like dividing 200 million people three ways.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nAnd as I've already pointed out,\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nevery year they'd have a battle of the network stars.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nIt was like, the Hulk is fighting the bionic woman.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:38.000\nThey're from different networks.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nGo fuck yourself.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nThis isn't capitalism.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:46.000\nTake your TV watching elsewhere?\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:49.000\nSo anyways, and now we don't know what to do.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nNow we're like, how do you be a human\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nand we're trying to learn?\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:55.000\nBecause I don't think that's a person in a wheelchair.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nIt's fantasy is for someone to go halfway upstairs\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nand then say, I forgot you were...\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:03.000\nThat's not their fantasy.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:07.000\nThat doesn't make their day.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:11.000\nAvalon is this guy in this powder blue sport jacket,\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:14.000\nwhich you were wearing when I met you.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:18.000\nHomeless.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nThis is the city for it.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nI just thought it was...\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nI'm not going to re-deliver this right,\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:26.000\nbut when I met him, a very friendly guy,\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\na huge fan and very nice,\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:32.000\nand I asked his name and he said, Avalon.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:37.000\nAnd so to demonstrate the timing\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:40.000\nbecause it requires overlap,\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nI'll be Avalon.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nYou ask me my name, I'll tell you Avalon,\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:45.000\nand then while you're...\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nI want to be Avalon.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nI can't be Avalon.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nYou can't be Avalon.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nYou have to be me for a second, okay?\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nSo I'll tell you my name's Avalon\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:59.000\nand then you hear the name and react to it\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nand I'll try to...\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nYou can't react as you would have reacted\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.000\nor as anybody would react.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nYeah, but just by repeating the name,\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:06.000\npuzzle through it.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:09.000\nOkay, I'll do what he did.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:10.000\nIt's very nice to meet you.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nMy name is Avalon.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:18.000\nMy mother thought she was having a stripper.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nThat's what he said while I was going,\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nAvalon?\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nVery charming.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nSometimes having a pat response to something\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nis very not charming.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nWhy don't you live in the moment?\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nBut your name is Avalon,\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nto have a fucking calling card like that?\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nThat's very charming.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nAll right, Avalon, that's it.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:40.000\nFlush.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nThat's it.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:46.000\nThat's it.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:50.000\nSo Avalon, is there a story to your name\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\nor is it just a name your parents thought was groovy?\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nI think my parents like listening to rock music.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:56.000\nOh, okay, there you are.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nYeah, that's how old we are.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nYeah, he said, I think my parents\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:04.000\nlike listening to rock music and fucking...\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nLike, I don't know, it's like...\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nAvalon's a cool name.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:12.000\nThe music I still listen to is classic.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nAll right, a couple more questions\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:17.000\nthat I want to bring up a friend that I met last night.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:20.000\nAre we doing an hour, an hour and a half or two hours?\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nDoes anyone know?\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nWell, I know you guys...\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nIt's not up to you guys.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nYou guys don't work here.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:30.000\nHow much do you want your tickets to be worth?\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nMore, more.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:36.000\nBecause God knows I'm great in that last half hour.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nThat's when it gets really good.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nI'm just worried the ghost of Steve Agee\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nwill kill us at one point.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nWell, you know that's not...\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:49.000\nSteve Agee's not here, that's the ghost of...\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nOh, no!\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:56.000\nThat's the ghost of Count Basanova.\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:00.000\nHe died during a long set by a bad comic.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nWe're going to bring Steve Agee down\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:06.000\nbecause I have a topic I want to address later on in the show.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\nOkay, just a couple random thoughts.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:12.000\nOkay, so when you guys are walking in Portland\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nbecause there's a lot of joggers,\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:15.000\ndoes everyone...\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nIs this an abused child thing?\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nOr when you're walking...\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nWhen you're walking on the sidewalk...\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:25.000\nThis is Dan's how you know you're a redneck sketch.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:34.000\nIf you're only nice to people for the first three months,\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nyou know them.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nYou might be an abused child.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nThe more you punish them,\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:44.000\nyour father might have thrown you around like a rag doll.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:47.000\nHilarious.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nWhen you're walking down the sidewalk\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:53.000\nand you hear a jogger behind you,\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:54.000\ndo you...\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:58.000\nIs your first interpretation of their feet on the pavement\n\n17:58.000 --> 17:59.000\nand the rhythm of it...\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:04.000\nDo you first, before your consciousness has time to reinterpret it,\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\ndo you think that they have a baseball bat\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nand they're about to kill you?\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:13.000\nOr is that like some mild PTSD that I have?\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nWell, I'm walking on the sidewalk.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nHow many joggers come up behind me\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nwhile I'm on my way to another drink?\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nBecause it's jogging time.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nIt's 9 a.m. and I'm like,\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:26.000\noh, my father's place is open.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:30.000\nAnd it was because it's Mother's Day.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:33.000\nI was the most charming thing I've ever seen.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nNo one in L.A. has mothers.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:37.000\nThe only mothers in L.A. are sitting in a dark living room\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.000\nwatching their old movies and smoking themselves to death.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nTheir children moved away.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:45.000\nBut it's nice to be in a city with moms on Mother's Day.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nBecause I walked into my father's place\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nand it's like a dive bar,\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nbut it has a restaurant attached.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nIt used to be a trek stop,\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nand every booth was filled with clearly,\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nlike, I was like, there's a mom, there's a mom.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nLike, they're a little dressed up,\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:59.000\nand they went to a dive bar and had a good breakfast.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nI hate Portland.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nFucking rubbing it in our faces.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nIt's like a homeschooled kid.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:08.000\nYou're the homeschooled kid of the nation.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\nYou don't understand how the world works.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:16.000\nLearn social cues.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nWhat's wrong with you?\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:22.000\nYou're technically nice, but goddammit, at what price?\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:25.000\nGet more dogs.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nSarcasm.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nI want to come here for my dogs.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nOkay, jogging bats out.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:34.000\nOkay, so I found out anything.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nI ran into a couple of stupid people here,\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:39.000\nbut they're from L.A., they're from L.A.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:42.000\nAnd I came up with a new technique,\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:45.000\nand every time I talk to a stupid person,\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\ninstead of so that I don't get mad,\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:52.000\nI'm going to think of them as a really smart animal.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:55.000\nLike, if they say something,\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nyou're like, why would you say that?\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nWhy would you ask me about that?\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:01.000\nAnd they're like, wow, because you're a super smart dog.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:04.000\nAn amazing dolphin.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nAll right, that's it.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:11.000\nThat's all I got for my little dumb quasi stand-up segment.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nLet's bring Steve A.G. out to the crowd.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.000\nNow, shall we?\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:18.000\nSteve A.G.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:23.000\nThe Phantom of the Opera is here.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nHey, Tori, is that mine?\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nOh, you...\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nThis is going to ask Tori for a drink.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nOh, no.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nOh, no.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nI didn't see.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nI turned one way.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nAre you okay?\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:35.000\nOkay.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:40.000\nIt's been Tori.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nSteve A.G., everybody.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nWait, is this water?\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nSure.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:46.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.000\nI think...\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:48.000\nI was going to...\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nYeah, okay.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nA.G. Tracing Dicks.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nTracing Dicks.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nTrace.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nIt's a nerd poker reference.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:57.000\nOh, okay.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nHow are you doing, A.G.?\n\n20:58.000 --> 20:59.000\nPretty good.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nYou enjoy Portland, Oregon?\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nI love it.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nI've been here a week.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nYeah?\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nWhat's your highlight?\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nA lot of marijuana.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.000\nI was going to say drugs,\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nbut that sounds like everything,\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nbut marijuana.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.000\nSounds like the highlight\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:15.000\nalmost erases itself.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nYeah.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nWhat's the big highlight?\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:20.000\nWhite joint.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:23.000\nWhite joint?\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nLike you almost couldn't...\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:27.000\nRacist drugs.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nI think we talked about this\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nwhen we brought it up recently\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nin a Harmontown.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:31.000\nThe idea of the super cool,\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:32.000\nremember that?\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:33.000\nDoes anyone ever do that anywhere?\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nDo you ever put a PCP in a joint?\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nOne person, I think.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nIt's called super cool?\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nSuper cool.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nThat sounds super cool.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nMy friend friend did a super cool\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\noutside of Jabberjaw.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:46.000\nDid you ever go to that?\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:47.000\nYeah.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nIt was a great rock and roll venue\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:50.000\nin kind of a shitty part of LA\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\non Arlington and Pico.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nAnd just for like Jabberjaw\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nand Bikini Kill\n\n21:54.000 -->

there\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:01.000\nand you could buy a joint\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nfrom a guy in the corner,\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:04.000\nbut you only had PCP in it.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:05.000\nAnd then you'd watch one of your friends\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nhave a fucking nervous breakdown\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:07.000\nin front of you.\n\n22:07.000 -->

explaining\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nwhy something fucked up happened\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.000\nin like movies and stuff.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:15.000\nSo you always wonder,\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:16.000\nlike, you go like,\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nwhy would anyone ever do a speedball?\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:19.000\nI only ever hear about it\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nwhen someone dies.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:21.000\nYeah.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:22.000\nBut there must be like a version\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.000\nof a speedball where you like,\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:24.000\nit's like really fun.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nI think, I think you,\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:27.000\nyou probably do a speedball twice.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:28.000\nThe first time worked,\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:29.000\nthe second time didn't.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:30.000\nYeah.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nI'm going to Bogota, Colombia\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:33.000\nto shoot something\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nand someone was telling me...\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nTo shoot what, Steve?\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nA speedball?\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:37.000\nTo shoot what?\n\n22:37.000 -->

documentary\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\non like this new drug.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nAnd it's specific to Bogota\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nwhere I'm going where it's a powder\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nand they just blow it in your face\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nand all of a sudden you're fully\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nunder their control\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:56.000\nand they're like, come on,\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:57.000\nlet's go to the ATM\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:58.000\nand you're like, okay, let's go.\n\n22:58.000 --> 22:59.000\nThis is Serpent of the Rainbow.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nYou're describing Serpent of the Rainbow.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nSerping what?\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nSerpent in the Rainbow.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nYes.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nYes.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.000\nThat's what happened to Bill Pullman\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nexcept they put him in a coffin\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\ninstead of an ATM.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nBut this is the thing\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nand you take out all your money,\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\ngive it to them\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nand you're just totally agreeable\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nand then you wake up the next day\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:15.000\nand you're like, where's my money?\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:16.000\nBut what if you're with a

23:34.000\nAre you sure this is that weird\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nbecause I did a lot of cocaine in my 20s\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:39.000\nand very often you'd have stuff\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\ngiven to you\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nand end up walking to an ATM\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:47.000\nand feeling very good\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nabout some very dirty people.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nThis is great.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:52.000\nI'll tell my parents\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:57.000\nI need twice as many groceries.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:58.000\nAnyways.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nSo did we ever figure out\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nis it 90 minutes, two hours, an hour?\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.000\nAndy told me you have two hours.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:04.000\nOh, sweet.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:05.000\nOkay, good.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:06.000\nBecause I'm just getting warmed up.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nI'm just getting warmed up.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nThey're going to call it\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nWarmland pretty soon\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nbecause I'm going to...\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:13.000\nOkay, I'm done.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nI'm done.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nWait, so if we do a two-hour show\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:18.000\nthe sun will still be up\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:19.000\nand we're done.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\nYep.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:21.000\nThat's where they like it.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nI'll see someone funny.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nThen we're all going to go to Union Jax\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nand do PCP.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:28.000\nOoh.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nEveryone come out to the...\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nYeah, there's some shows like that\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nso I heard somebody brought everybody\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nout to a parking lot\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nand there was Darth Vader\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:37.000\non a unicycle.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nI would say 10 years ago\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:42.000\nI went to Union Jax, I think by myself\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nbecause you go to strip clubs alone\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nand Union Jax, for those of you\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nthat do not live in Portland\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nis one of Portland's shadier strip clubs\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nin a great way.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nAnd I think every girl there was a drug dealer\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nbecause I ended up with all of them\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nback in my hotel room\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nas there was a fucking\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\npharmacopeia of drugs there.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nEvery one of them opened up their purse\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:03.000\nand had just wild ass\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nexotic class A drugs on them.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:06.000\nIt was really good.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:09.000\nSo we're going to Union Jax after this.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:12.000\nWe've established that.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:16.000\nAll right, so I want to bring\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\na

to him\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nand part way into the conversation\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nI was like, okay, stop.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nYou should come on Harmontown\n\n25:27.000 -->

mythical\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:35.000\nand I don't want to...\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nI'm a horrible interviewer\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:38.000\nso I don't want to say at the top\n\n25:38.000 -->

superficial layer,\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nyou're a bigfoot hunter.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nUh...\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nenthusiast.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nHe's already a bigfoot enthusiast.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nYou can't say hunter.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nYou gotta really eat the mic.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nHe's gotta eat the mic.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nWell, there are guys,\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nwe talked a little bit about the bigfoot hunting community\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nand there's guys who want to kill bigfoot\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nand there's guys who want to protect bigfoot.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nYeah, so they don't say bigfoot hunters.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nSome of them do,\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nbut that's like the Texas guys.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nThey shoot to kill, basically.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nThey want to shoot first\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nand ask questions later on bigfoot.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nThere's so many questions.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nYeah, I know, there are a million questions.\n\n27:57.000 --> 28:01.000\nIt's to protect the species, to have a body.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nCan you divide the kill bigfoot people\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\ninto two people?\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nAre there people who want to kill bigfoot\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nto protect the species\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.000\nand people who want to kill bigfoot\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nbecause they hate them?\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nYeah, or they have like a polar bear already.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nLike a rhino.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nHow would killing a bigfoot\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nprotect the species?\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nWell, you can study them.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nWell, then you say, oh, okay.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nThey must be in danger.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nYeah, these liberal assholes.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nIt's even more endangered.\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nIf we just nut up and shoot the fucker,\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nwe could get one.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nBut these liberal peaceniks\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nwho are trying to trap them with a big box\n\n28:39.000 -->

49:01.000\nkind of simple, like, D&D kind of thing.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.000\nAll right.\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.000\nAll right, Spencer, this is a curved bobble.\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:07.000\nLet's let her up.\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nLet's just try it.\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nLet's see if we can come up with an intro.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nAren't you glad we smoked all that weed, Spencer?\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nWhat's the worst that can happen, Steve?\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:23.000\nI mean...\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.000\nLast time on Harmontown.\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\nWait, no.\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:33.000\nYou...\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:35.000\nIt's been two hours since the car broke down,\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nand you've yet to see signs\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:39.000\nof human life\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\non the road.\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:45.000\nGlows come from south.\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:47.000\nYou think that you might be able to make it back to town,\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nbut the quickest way is through the woods.\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nYou're not sure\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\nhow to proceed, whether you should\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:55.000\nleave the safety of your car\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\nand vent your outer.\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:59.000\nStay safe inside.\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:01.000\nGo.\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:03.000\nWho's driving?\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:05.000\nIt's a broken down car.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nWho's at the wheel?\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nI can't get any reception out here, dude.\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:15.000\nI think we have to walk.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\nHe's at the wheel?\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nHe's kicking ass right now is what he's doing.\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nThere's like...\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.000\nI'm AT&T.\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:25.000\nIs anyone else not on AT&T?\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nI got no bars out here.\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nI'm on Verizon.\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:31.000\nI got nothing.\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:33.000\nI used my power\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:35.000\nto talk to animals,\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:37.000\nand I...\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\nI call out,\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nChipmunk!\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nYour cry\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\nechoes out in the woods.\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nYou hear the scattering of birds,\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:57.000\nChipmunks.\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nDid you roll that?\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.000\nHe doesn't have any dice,\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:03.000\nbut why are you saying\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nyou have the power to talk to Chipmunks?\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.000\nThat's insane.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nIt's worth a fucking try.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nNo.\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nI mean, I don't want to be critical,\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nbut if I was, it would go something like this.\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.000\nSteve just blew\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:21.000\nsome of that Bogota powder in my mouth.\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:23.000\nI don't know\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:25.000\nI don't know when it's going on.\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:27.000\nI talk to all the Chipmunks\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:29.000\nand it's like, do you have dice?\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:31.000\nDid you roll that?\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:33.000\nLet's get serious.\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:35.000\nThis is why system is important.\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:37.000\nI say even though Dan, I know what you're going to say,\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:39.000\nbecause you're the adventurer, Ted,\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:41.000\nthat wants to walk through the woods\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nrather than get back in the car\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nand they tell you to stay put when you get lost.\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nThey tell you that?\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.000\nYou didn't even know that.\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:51.000\nYou're probably going to say\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\nlet's just wander towards that glowing part\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nin the woods and let's roll the dice.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nDo you know\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nthat this neighborhood of the woods\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:01.000\nis supposed to be lousy\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:03.000\nwith Sasquatch?\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:05.000\nYou actually believe in Sasquatch?\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:07.000\nYes, I do and I'll tell you why.\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:09.000\nFuck you, we're going through the woods.\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:11.000\nFuck you, Steve.\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nWell, wait

want to call it, Craig.\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:37.000\nAnd so, what do you think?\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\nIs this Bigfoot Country?\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.000\nDefinitely Squatchy, bro.\n\n52:41.000

wildest dreams, we'd stumble upon\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\na creature\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:13.000\nOh, it's Bigfoot.\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\nThey travel, guys,\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.000\nthey

faction.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nI use my low light vision to look for the forest.\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.000\nYou're not...\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nJust follow us.\n\n53:35.000 -->

2015.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nWe're broken down in a car.\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nIt's freezing.\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nWe're going to die if we stay here.\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nChipmunk!\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nI'm getting out of the car\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nand I'm going to at least walk\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\ntowards the glow until I get bars on my phone.\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nCraig, I'd appreciate it if you came with\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nbecause you seem rugged.\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nYeah, bro.\n\n54:21.000 -->

54:43.000\nAlright.\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nWhere's the glow?\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nTo the south.\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nHead south.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nI don't believe in Bigfoot,\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nbut if we do run into one,\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nhe's the guy to have with us.\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nSo let's just go.\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nWe

think there's enough of us that we can do it.\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nWe're all agreed right now.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nIf we see a Bigfoot, kill it.\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nYeah, we're all coincidentally,\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\neven though we're now first being asked\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nwhat kind of Bigfoot enthusiast we are,\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nwe're all in the Ted Nugent camp.\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nJust by coincidence.\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nWe're going to eat it too.\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nSpencer, we move south.\n\n55:25.000 -->

check behind you,\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nbut you see nothing.\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.000\nChipmunks.\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\nThere's no chipmunks around here.\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\nI called out earlier, nothing happened.\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nIt's your phone chirps.\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nOne of you might have reception.\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:47.000\nI look at my phone.\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nStill no bars, not me.\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:51.000\nNot me, man.\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nOh, shit.\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:57.000\nIt's an old, I'm

too.\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nThat also happens.\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nWe find him pouring a cast.\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nCraig, what the fuck are these?\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nI'm preserving what appears to be\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nSasquatchi and...\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nThis campfire is Squatchy, man.\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nCraig, what do you think?\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nDude, did you just dump that plaster in\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nwithout splatter?\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nDo anything with splatter technique first?\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nJeff?\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nI don't know the

--> 01:01:37.000\nfirst you just splatter a little bit\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nall over the place, just splatter.\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nSo there's no air pockets, right?\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nJust to get the nice coat there.\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nBecause when you dump it in,\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nit distorts the evidence.\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nOh, because of the weight of the alginate.\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nThere's more footprints.\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nThere's loads of footprints.\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nThere's only one at a time.\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000\nOh, that's why they don't call him Big Feet.\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nThat makes sense.\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nHe only ever leaves one print.\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nAll right.\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nWell, he's doing that.\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nIs it an actual burning campfire?\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nBecause that's a bigger deal than any footprint\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nthat someone made of fire.\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nYeah, you see, it's not a proper fire,\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nbut there's definitely burn\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nburning and burned\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nlogs and wooden pieces\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nthat were arranged together.\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nThey've been scattered as if someone tried to\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\ndrop kick or quickly put out the fire\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nin haste to make a hasty retreat.\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nBut we saw the glow.\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nThat means we're upon entities\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nthat we were coming in.\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nThis is Squatchy.\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nThere's a Big Foot track here.\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nWe caught Big Feet.\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nI examine the ground for any, like,\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nspore or hair or any kind of like\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000\namateur, amateur.\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nOh, spore.\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nWell, Craig, what would you do?\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nThis is where we're going to live\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nfor a while.\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nGuys.\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nI thought we were hiring into civilization.\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nWhat's this guy talking about?\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nWow, all right.\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nI cast magic sleeping bag.\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nSo then,\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nokay, let's live here.\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nAnd then, uh...\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nLet's move it together.\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nMagical sleeping bag pops into existence.\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nCan we advance time\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nand we've lived there a while?\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nSure.\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nHow long do you want\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nto have advanced time?\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nWe've all got beers and we have our own alphabet.\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nWait, wait, we're...\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nI've also carved\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000\na rocking chair out of a sequoia.\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nAll right, those things happen.\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nSteve and I are married.\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nWe have an agreement\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nthat when we get back,\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nwe won't talk

01:04:27.000\nHere it is.\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nIt's coming, guys.\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nIt's burning firewood, man.\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nThey're cutting all this shit.\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nI know, this place is like a parking lot now.\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nA couple more trees\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nand we have to start a

parents\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nand we were like...\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nIt was so weird because\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nI kept getting upset because\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nof your parents, like, there's no way\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nyou can ever become, like...\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nYou always, like, prep yourself.\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nYou're like, okay, now I'm 58.\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nMy parents are almost dead.\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nI'm definitely...\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nI'm done with this.\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nI'm not gonna start acting like a child.\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000\nAnd then we started playing catchphrase with my parents\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000\nand I was on my mom's team and she was like,\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nI don't know, Tweety Bird?\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nAnd I'm like, the buzzer went off and I went,\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nYeeeeww, cunt!\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nUh, where did that come from?\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000\nWhere did that come from?\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nBut it was...\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nI called my mom the C word.\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nHoly shit.\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nBecause she couldn't guess what Tweety Bird was\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nor something.\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nBut it was because within three minutes\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nof her arriving, like,\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nin front of Erin, like, my mom has this weird,\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nlike, capacity for...\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000\nShe doesn't understand what she's doing.\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nShe could figure out how to call you fat,\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nlike, without...\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nShe's like Houdini of calling you fat.\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nAnd then she...\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nIt was in my boot.\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nThere's no way she...\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nShe has to call me fat somehow.\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nShe always figures it out within three minutes.\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nLike, let me know how much weight I've gained.\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nAnd I was just like, it's unbelievable.\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nAnd then I swallow that down and then I'm like...\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nI mean, they say to not date a man\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nwho has issues with his mother.\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nBut the gag became like...\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nYou can double down.\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nSo I was getting jostled.\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nAnd then we were...\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nWe were not married yet.\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nWe were very...\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nWe were fresh.\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nI was going to say very much in love.\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nAnd then I was like, okay.\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nAnd so we would...\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nBefore I really got things changed with Steve.\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nI was getting riled up.\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nBut then I would get riled up\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nand I would start to spill over into Erin\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nand then you...\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nYou were like, hey,\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nI love you.\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nAnd then I would go, I love you.\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nBut it was sort of like a joke.\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nIt was kind of ironic.\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nAnd then my dad started doing the joke\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nof everyone was just saying I love you\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nand that became the running joke.\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nAny time someone started to get upset,\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000\neveryone would just say I love you.\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nSo it was a joke.\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000\nBut that we all operated as a healthy family for...\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nIt was like a bit.\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nLet's do that bit\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nwhere we stop getting angry\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nand say I love you.\n\n01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nThat's how we needed to parse it.\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nWas this before you called your mom a cunt or after?\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nNo, I mean, it was during.\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nIt was during.\n\n01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nOrdinarily...\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nI think what happened is I called my mom a cunt\n\n01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nand then I said, I love you.\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000\nI've never told you this\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000\nand I had forgotten about it.\n\n01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nBut I was going through my old iPad pictures\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nand I had my iPad with me\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nthat night and I have a picture\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nthat's a selfie.\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nI'm assuming I'm not the only one\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nwho takes pictures of themselves in moments\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nthat are like, remember that moment\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000\nwhen you were here in this place\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nand there's a picture of me\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000\nwide-eyed.\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000\nI'll post it somewhere with Dan\n\n01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nand his parents in the background\n\n01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000\nand I'm just like...\n\n01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000\nThis is where you are.\n\n01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000\nThis is this moment.\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000\nEither in three years you'll be married\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000\nor you'll be telling stories about this\n\n01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000\ninsane night.\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nI did not know that you were going through that.\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nI thought you were\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nlike this earth goddess\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nthat was like, your tendrils were just\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000\naffecting us and that we were psycho\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nand it wasn't affecting you.\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nOh no, I was like...\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000\nPlease don't take back\n\n01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000\ncalling me an earth goddess.\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nI'll kill myself.\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nI am an earth goddess.\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nI wasn't having a bad time\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nbut there was obviously so much tension\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nand Dan's mom\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nwas calling him fat\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nand it was very strange\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nand Dan's dad was on my

That's only if we end to see reach around.\n\n01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000\nA lot of people ask that.\n\n01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000\nShouldn't we have a secret?\n\n01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000\nNo, this isn't...\n\n01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000\nI say, can I make a pitch?\n\n01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000\nYeah.\n\n01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000\nOne, two, three, we all whisper gently,\n\n01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000\nI got your back, and then if you want to start jerking somebody off,\n\n01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000\nyou can, but you only got eight seconds.\n\n01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000\nThat's called a Tennessee reach around\n\n01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000\nwith a Seattle finish.\n\n01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000\nI thought maybe they hated Seattle.\n\n01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000\nI took a chance.\n\n01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000\nWho's standing behind who?\n\n01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000\nHuh?

your hand around...\n\n01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000\nI guess the cleanest way to do this\n\n01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000\nis for us to all take our pants down\n\n01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000\nbefore we start this.\n\n01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000\nDick's out.\n\n01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000\nDick's out?\n\n01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000\nI'm a woman, so...\n\n01:52:51.000 -->

pull up your pants\n\n01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000\nif you don't want it.\n\n01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000\nOn the count of three?\n\n01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000\nI have to urinate really bad,\n\n01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000\nso nothing might come out.\n\n01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000\nWhat if you pee instead of cum?\n\n01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000\nExactly.\n\n01:53:35.000 -->

down.\n\n01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000\nThen we open our eyes, you look at the person in front of you,\n\n01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000\nif their pants are down, that means they're open\n\n01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000\nto reach around with Seattle Finish.\n\n01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000\nThen we count to three again,\n\n01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000\nand then we say, I got you back,\n\n01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000\nand then if you want to jerk somebody off,\n\n01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000\neight seconds.\n\n01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000\nWhy don't we all just

what we're doing.\n\n01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000\nShould we have Craig come back up?\n\n01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000\nCraig, are you here?\n\n01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000\nCan we all just practice our Tennessee reach arounds?\n\n01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000\nYeah, we should practice.\n\n01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000\nWe should do a practice round.\n\n01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000\nClose your eyes.\n\n01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000\nOne, two, three.\n\n01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000\nAnd I'm inside.\n\n01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000\nCome on, Aaron.\n\n01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000\nI'm inside.\n\n01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000\nWell, this is going to work out easy.\n\n01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000\nGood job, guys.\n\n01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000\nI'm grabbing him.\n\n01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000\nYou got Hakai?\n\n01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000\nHakai, can we talk to you outside?\n\n01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000\nYeah.\n\n01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000\nAll right, this way.\n\n01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000\nJust be open-minded.\n\n01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000\nOkay.\n\n01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000\nOh, hey man.\n\n01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000\nHey.\n\n01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000\nHakai,\n\n01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000\nI haven't explained to him\n\n01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000\nwhat's going down,\n\n01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000\nbut we're going to do\n\n01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000\nour rituals.\n\n01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000\nI feel like it's pretty self-explanatory,\n\n01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000\nbut laying out for it.\n\n01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000\nSpencer at the bar,\n\n01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000\nat one point was like,\n\n01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000\nI forgot my shadow run notes.\n\n01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000\nDon't worry about it.\n\n01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000\nI think we're going to be fine.\n\n01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000\nWhat if we saw\n\n01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000\nhe got his notes and we looked at it\n\n01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000\nand it was like\n\n01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000\nneedlessly arguing about\n\n01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000\njerking each other off.\n\n01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000\nLike three seconds,\n\n01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000\nthen raise your hand.\n\n01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000\nYou know what?\n\n01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000\nLet's stand in the circle.\n\n01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000\nPart of this is just trusting each other.\n\n01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000\nI'm going to explain this,\n\n01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000\nand we're going to go one, two, three,\n\n01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000\nand we're going to do it.\n\n01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000\nYou were here when we decided\n\n01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000\nwho was going to take our pants off.\n\n01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000\nBut we should count as being given the opportunity, right?\n\n01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000\nSo at the count of three,\n\n01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000\nif you want to get jerked off,\n\n01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000\nor\n\n01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000\nif you want to be in this brotherhood,\n\n01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000\nor what is this?\n\n01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000\nWe're the toughest gang in town.\n\n01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000\nIt honestly is if you want to get jerked off,\n\n01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000\nbecause it doesn't preclude...\n\n01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000\nAlso, are you guys hard?\n\n01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000\nHow is this working?\n\n01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000\nThat's none of your business.\n\n01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000\nI'm a woman.\n\n01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000\nRight.\n\n01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000\nSo it is...\n\n01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000\nThis is one of the moments when I imagine\n\n01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000\na floating mom head\n\n01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000\nwith her eyes just...\n\n01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000\nYou could have been a lawyer.\n\n01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000\nAnd a floating hand\n\n01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000\ncoming up above the head.\n\n01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000\nThere are gangs who beat the crap out of their new people,\n\n01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000\nwhich is a dumb move\n\n01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000\nin terms of Darwinism.\n\n01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000\nIt's like, oh, this new guy,\n\n01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000\nlet's make him physically injured.\n\n01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000\nThis is what we do.\n\n01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000\nIt's about choice.\n\n01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000\nThere's no wrong answer, or so you don't know.\n\n01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000\nLet's get in the circle.\n\n01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000\nAll right, let's do it.\n\n01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000\nGet in the circle.\n\n01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000\nNice.\n\n01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000\nOne.\n\n01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000\nI got your back, bro.\n\n01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000\nI got your back.\n\n01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000\nI got your back.\n\n01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000\nHe's in.\n\n01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000\nWho's behind him?\n\n01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000\nHack guy likes it.\n\n01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000\nYou're behind him, right?\n\n01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000\nI'm behind you, hack guy.\n\n01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000\nThat's why he dropped his pants.\n\n01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000\nHe's in front of a 19-year-old...\n\n01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000\nThis is successful.\n\n01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000\nWe did it.\n\n01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000\nWe all just agreed to a\n\n01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000\ntrack off orgy.\n\n01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000\nIt's a circle, sir.\n\n01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000\nWe all agreed, right?\n\n01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000\nWe already did it.\n\n01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000\nNow we have to do it.\n\n01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000\nWhy are we closing our eyes?\n\n01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000\nJust do it.\n\n01:59:27.000 -->
