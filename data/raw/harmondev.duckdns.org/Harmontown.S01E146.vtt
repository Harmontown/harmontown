00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Welcome Brits Town, from the Brits Town Comedy Festival in Portland, Oregon, Harmontown,

00:21.000 --> 00:40.000
just now in such a... Oh yeah. Please welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:40.000 --> 01:07.000
Hello, thank you. Thank you. Oh, family. Thank you. Jeff, when you warm up the crowd when we go to Portland,

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
and you talk about how great Portland is, and you ask him how long they've been in Portland,

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
what do you think I'm going to talk to them about? You're doing my act. I don't have an act. I don't do magic tricks.

01:18.000 --> 01:26.000
That was half my act. I love Portland. I'm glad you're warmed up, but now I got nothing.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Portland can bear both of our love, Dan. Oh, it can. It can bear everybody's. It's a wonderful town.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
What's your favorite thing about Portland, Oregon? I love the feeling of ass-kiss exhaustion.

01:37.000 --> 01:47.000
Of loving a city so much that you get mad. Fucking fuck Portland. Every time Aaron and I come here,

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
we extend our stay by a couple more days, because we're constantly, like I'm sure every person from Los Angeles

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
talks about moving here, I'm sure. We have to be typical. And so we keep staying here longer and longer,

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
because we just want to get mad at something. We've got to find out what these people are bad at.

02:06.000 --> 02:15.000
What are you bad at? Parallel parking. Parallel parking. Okay. I'll believe it.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
What is the worst thing about being in Portland? Is there a thing that you guys are known for being shitty at

02:19.000 --> 02:28.000
besides parallel parking? Merging? Asshole drivers. Passive aggression. It's very interesting.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
Some girl pointed at somebody else that's passive aggression.

02:36.000 --> 02:44.000
Passive aggression when they nod their head, like, tell them, Kevin, what do you mean?

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
Fucking Kevin, he's the worst. Your yogurt shop that won't let anyone in unless they turn off their phone.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
You guys love yogurt still, right? It's still 1993. And Seattle. If there's anything,

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm telling you now, I'm kind of a Portland expert in one degree, because I want to ask that,

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
because I'm only ever walking around your town. So four or five visits to Portland, I feel comfortable saying

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
their homeless population is very distinct. And it's not, like in San Francisco, the homeless population is like,

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
I think they're Mad Max homeless people, because who doesn't want to be a homeless guy in San Francisco?

03:23.000 --> 03:30.000
It's high stakes. So they're actually people who could own homes here or in LA.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
When you become homeless, you want to be in San Francisco so that you feel less homeless.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
So the homeless people in San Francisco have garbage can lids for vests.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
And they have like gimmicks, like they do card tricks. It's a fucking racket, man. It's like a full time job.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
I was walking down the road here on Eastburnside, and is that where we are, right?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Thank you. Wow.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
They're sharp. It's 4pm, by the way. We're not going to be funny at 4pm, but you guys are going to be very, like, on your shit.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I'm on three cups of coffee. Yep, yep, yep, yep.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
The comedy rule is that nothing's funny when the sun's out, but we're in Portland, so the sun's never out.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
I was walking up the road just right here by Sizzle Pie, and there were two just good and proper homeless dudes.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
Like, there were two guys hanging out, like, kind of middle-aged white guys that looked like your proper art department winos.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
And I was...

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
They're very well-designed homeless people you guys have here.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
They have, like, cool tattoos, dogs.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
We got Steve Agee laughing like the Phantom of the Opera up here.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
Oh, no!

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I thought you were dead!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I forgot we got...

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
I was walking down the road to go get some Sizzle Pie, which I quite enjoy, and these two guys were sitting there in a doorway, like, lurking,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
and just, like, kind of supine and sharing a beer.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
And a guy started to, like, gesture to me and say something, and under normal circumstances,

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
that would be, uh, brother, can you spare a dime?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Have you got any spare change, kind of stuff?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
He goes, nice coat, man.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Oh, my God!

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
He didn't want shit! He wanted to fucking enjoy my coat.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I've been getting that for three days!

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
I was, Aaron got me this At-At shirt for the Star Wars At-At shirt.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
And the whole, maybe, okay, so they're faking it, because they're like, cool shirt, bro.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Wait, wait, were they just here in the doorway, just on the block right here?

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
Well, everywhere. No, multiple homeless people loved my At-At shirt.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
No, they didn't. They're Portland homeless people.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
And you guys are secretly vain.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
And they are, this is the biosphere.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
We're just learning this now.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
They're, like, living on the methane of this ocean floor, because there's no sun,

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
so they're like, okay, compliment their hair on their shirt.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
That's the difference between a Portland homeless guy that lives to see a homeless tomorrow.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Even the homeless people are passive-aggressive here.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
Wow, a nice, expensive coat you've got there.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
But I saw it.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
I guess I'll just sit here in the shade and, like, be in a puddle for the rest of my life.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
They're more packed up, too, though. They're less solo.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
I'm gonna strike out a theory that just from the, I'm sure you guys are sick of being characterized

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
as, like, wonderfuls and people and, like, liberal and wonderful and nurturing.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
There's probably some small part of you that's driving home at night and going,

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
like, why don't out of towners just understand that I'm fucked up, too?

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
Just because I can hold a city together doesn't mean I'm a fucking,

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
I'm this highway to heaven for you when you're coming out of town.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
But I'm telling you guys, to the extent that you are Portland,

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
I mean, you guys are pretty infuriatingly cool and hard to upset.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
You're very nice to out of towners.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
But there was a guy, I don't know if I can even, I have no idea if he was homeless,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
but he was definitely strange.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
He was a middle-aged guy and he was holding a skateboard.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I immediately wrote this down.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
The last time I was in Portland, I feel like I had an encounter that I had to immediately write down

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
because, like, they asked for money.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
I would have to scroll back through our backlog because I told the story.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
They asked for a couple of years ago.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
They asked for money, and I think I gave them money,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
and then they said, thank you, we're crackheads.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
And then some weird, like, kind of flourish.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Like, you got to be careful out here.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
I can't remember what it was, but anyways.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
But I remember writing it down and presenting it to the show.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
And then again, it happened because this middle-aged guy who's like,

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
had like a kind of riff-raff from Rocky Horror kind of hair style,

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
and he was holding a skateboard and he was dressed in like,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
with like heavy metal kind of like fan,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
like a heavy metal concert goer kind of clothes,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
but like also kind of fucked up like he's been,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
he's seen a couple nights under a bridge,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
but he's holding a skateboard and had the riff-raff hair,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
and was like my age, and as we passed each other,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
when I was eight feet from him, he said,

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
do you have a cigarette?

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
So I had four feet to say, no, I don't, sorry.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
And then as he passed me, even though neither of us slowed down,

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
he said, do you have any Mortal Kombat stuff?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Please tell me you said yes.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Well, I have to stress though that it was like,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
then I was four feet, there were eight feet apart,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
and I just, but commenced 30 years of head scratching,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
that'll never, this is why I need to believe in God,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
because I need to believe that these moments will be explained to me.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
That guy, he was, he was, he wanted to,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
he had, he was, he just got kicked out of his place,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
and he had a bag full of Mortal Kombat like stuff,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
and he just wanted to tell you stuff, and I'm like, oh good.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
And then God says like, plus you had eight spiders in your mouth.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Any more trivia you want to know?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Yes, like lots of stuff, like you could spend 500 years

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
analyzing the 57 years I'm going to be here.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
I got in the car from my hotel, or my hotel,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
like a decent walk from here,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
and I was getting a ride over here,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
and there was a guy on the road carrying a skateboard,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
and I think it was a guy because he looked like me

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
if he had a skateboard.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
If I was walking down the street with a skateboard

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
and wasn't wearing a suit, my height,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
my kind of haircut, like my build,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
and yet, perfect tits.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
It was a guy, it was clearly a guy,

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
and he had like beautiful bouncing boobs in his shirts,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
and he was just cruising down the road with a skateboard.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
I'm like, that's a good town.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
This is Jeff Davis with delicious double D

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
is walking down the road.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
That's specific enough that that guy's probably listening,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I think, I know.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
So, call in.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I want to, speaking of reaching out to specific fans

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
and wondering things, I had a strange,

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
because I caught myself doing something so odd today.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I know that there's differently abled Harmontown fans,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I don't know if there's any here tonight,

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
but specifically wheelchair using folk.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
That's the term, right?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Nailed it.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
I'm so frightened of everything now.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
It expresses itself so much more, the bigot sounding,

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
wheelchair using folk.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
You're great, you're Eleanoldo, you're nailing it.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
I passed a guy in a wheelchair,

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
and I caught myself, this was the first time in 42 years,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I was conscious of my behavior,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
because I wonder if any differently abled Harmonians,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
have you ever, do you constantly experience something

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
that I would call the wheelchair smile?

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
From non-differently abled people?

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Because I made this weird face,

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
like this very polite kind of like,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
I was like, what did I mean by that face?

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
Like, nice wheelchair, what did I mean?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
What does that face mean?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And I wonder if people that are bound...

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Nice spokes.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah, like what does that face mean?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I bet it makes them feel like living ghosts,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
and makes them very upset,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
because it's not a natural face,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
why can't you just see me as a human being?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
You fat piece of shit.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Welcome to Portland.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I'm the only angry person in Portland.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Dan, let's say, God forbid,

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
that you had some accident or some debilitating illness that made you...

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Sooner than it will inevitably happen, yes.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
That you were wheelchair bound,

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
and you were going down the road or here in a crowd,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
what look would you like to get from other people?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Well, obviously I would like...

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
I mean, it's not a funny answer,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
but I would like no look, I would like...

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
We all remember...

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Well, we don't all remember, you're 22.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
The...

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
This was the 80s definition.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
I've referenced this before.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
The 80s definition of political correctness was on different strokes

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
when Arnold was introduced to a kid in a wheelchair.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Every sitcom back then had one episode about a kid in a wheelchair,

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
and I think they got money from London or something if they did it.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
It's the handicapped capital of the world.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
None of this makes sense.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
It's four in the afternoon, I'm already drunk.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Suffer through this.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
Hey, Avalon, hey, how are you doing, buddy?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Let's talk about Avalon in a second.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
And then we'll have guests, and we'll do a show.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Arnold Jackson, that was his name,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Gary Coleman's character in different strokes.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
He befriends a kid in a wheelchair,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
and they have like a play date.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And then he...

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I think Arnold refuses the call to adventure.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
He's like, I don't want to be friends with a guy in a wheelchair.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
That's uncomfortable.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
And then the road to trials is like they share action figures or something,

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
and they're like making friends.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
And then Arnold says, like, come on, I want to show you my goldfish.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Let's go upstairs.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
And he runs up the stairs and then stops halfway up the stairs

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
and turns back around and looks at the kid in the wheelchair and says,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
I'm sorry, I forgot you were...

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
And then the kid in the wheelchair, like half for the narrative

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
and mostly for the planet, like goes, Arnold, that's the nicest thing

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
anyone's ever said to me.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
And the audience applauds instead of laughing,

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
which is how you know it's the 80s when a sitcom could get a pause

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
for not being funny.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Because it's like, there were three channels

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
and it was a secretly socialist, like, fascist regime.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
It was like dividing 200 million people three ways.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
And as I've already pointed out,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
every year they'd have a battle of the network stars.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
It was like, the Hulk is fighting the bionic woman.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
They're from different networks.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Go fuck yourself.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
This isn't capitalism.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
What are you going to do?

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Take your TV watching elsewhere?

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
So anyways, and now we don't know what to do.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Now we're like, how do you be a human

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
and we're trying to learn?

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Because I don't think that's a person in a wheelchair.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
It's fantasy is for someone to go halfway upstairs

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
and then say, I forgot you were...

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
That's not their fantasy.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
That doesn't make their day.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
Avalon is this guy in this powder blue sport jacket,

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
which you were wearing when I met you.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
Homeless.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
This is the city for it.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I just thought it was...

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
I'm not going to re-deliver this right,

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
but when I met him, a very friendly guy,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
a huge fan and very nice,

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
and I asked his name and he said, Avalon.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
And so to demonstrate the timing

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
because it requires overlap,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I'll be Avalon.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
You ask me my name, I'll tell you Avalon,

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
and then while you're...

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I want to be Avalon.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I can't be Avalon.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
You can't be Avalon.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
You have to be me for a second, okay?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Okay, all right.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
So I'll tell you my name's Avalon

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
and then you hear the name and react to it

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
and I'll try to...

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
You can't react as you would have reacted

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
or as anybody would react.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Yeah, but just by repeating the name,

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
puzzle through it.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Okay, I'll do what he did.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
It's very nice to meet you.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
My name is Avalon.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
My mother thought she was having a stripper.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
That's what he said while I was going,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Avalon?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Very charming.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Sometimes having a pat response to something

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
is very not charming.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Why don't you live in the moment?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
But your name is Avalon,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
to have a fucking calling card like that?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
That's very charming.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
All right, Avalon, that's it.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Flush.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
That's it.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
That's it.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
So Avalon, is there a story to your name

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
or is it just a name your parents thought was groovy?

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
I think my parents like listening to rock music.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Oh, okay, there you are.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah, that's how old we are.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Yeah, he said, I think my parents

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
like listening to rock music and fucking...

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Like, I don't know, it's like...

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Avalon's a cool name.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
The music I still listen to is classic.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
All right, a couple more questions

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
that I want to bring up a friend that I met last night.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Are we doing an hour, an hour and a half or two hours?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Does anyone know?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Well, I know you guys...

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
It's not up to you guys.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
You guys don't work here.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
How much do you want your tickets to be worth?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
More, more.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Because God knows I'm great in that last half hour.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
That's when it gets really good.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I'm just worried the ghost of Steve Agee

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
will kill us at one point.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Well, you know that's not...

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
Steve Agee's not here, that's the ghost of...

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Oh, no!

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
That's the ghost of Count Basanova.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
He died during a long set by a bad comic.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
We're going to bring Steve Agee down

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
because I have a topic I want to address later on in the show.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Okay, just a couple random thoughts.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Okay, so when you guys are walking in Portland

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
because there's a lot of joggers,

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
does everyone...

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Is this an abused child thing?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Or when you're walking...

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
When you're walking on the sidewalk...

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
This is Dan's how you know you're a redneck sketch.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
If you're only nice to people for the first three months,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
you know them.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
You might be an abused child.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
The more you punish them,

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
your father might have thrown you around like a rag doll.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
Hilarious.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
When you're walking down the sidewalk

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
and you hear a jogger behind you,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
do you...

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
Is your first interpretation of their feet on the pavement

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
and the rhythm of it...

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
Do you first, before your consciousness has time to reinterpret it,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
do you think that they have a baseball bat

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
and they're about to kill you?

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
Or is that like some mild PTSD that I have?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Well, I'm walking on the sidewalk.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
How many joggers come up behind me

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
while I'm on my way to another drink?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Because it's jogging time.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
It's 9 a.m. and I'm like,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
oh, my father's place is open.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
And it was because it's Mother's Day.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I was the most charming thing I've ever seen.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
No one in L.A. has mothers.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
The only mothers in L.A. are sitting in a dark living room

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
watching their old movies and smoking themselves to death.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Their children moved away.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
But it's nice to be in a city with moms on Mother's Day.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Because I walked into my father's place

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
and it's like a dive bar,

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
but it has a restaurant attached.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
It used to be a trek stop,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
and every booth was filled with clearly,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
like, I was like, there's a mom, there's a mom.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Like, they're a little dressed up,

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
and they went to a dive bar and had a good breakfast.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I hate Portland.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Fucking rubbing it in our faces.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
It's like a homeschooled kid.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
You're the homeschooled kid of the nation.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
You don't understand how the world works.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
Learn social cues.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
What's wrong with you?

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
You're technically nice, but goddammit, at what price?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Get more dogs.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Sarcasm.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I want to come here for my dogs.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Okay, jogging bats out.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Okay, so I found out anything.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I ran into a couple of stupid people here,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
but they're from L.A., they're from L.A.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
And I came up with a new technique,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
and every time I talk to a stupid person,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
instead of so that I don't get mad,

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
I'm going to think of them as a really smart animal.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Like, if they say something,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
you're like, why would you say that?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Why would you ask me about that?

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
And they're like, wow, because you're a super smart dog.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
An amazing dolphin.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
All right, that's it.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
That's all I got for my little dumb quasi stand-up segment.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Let's bring Steve A.G. out to the crowd.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Now, shall we?

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Steve A.G.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
The Phantom of the Opera is here.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Hey, Tori, is that mine?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Oh, you...

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
This is going to ask Tori for a drink.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Oh, no.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Oh, no.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
I didn't see.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
I turned one way.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Are you okay?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Okay.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
It's been Tori.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Steve A.G., everybody.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Wait, is this water?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Sure.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Okay, all right.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
I think...

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
I was going to...

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Yeah, okay.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
A.G. Tracing Dicks.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Tracing Dicks.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Trace.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
It's a nerd poker reference.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Oh, okay.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
How are you doing, A.G.?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Pretty good.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
You enjoy Portland, Oregon?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I love it.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
I've been here a week.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Yeah?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
What's your highlight?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
A lot of marijuana.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I was going to say drugs,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
but that sounds like everything,

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
but marijuana.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Sounds like the highlight

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
almost erases itself.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
What's the big highlight?

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
White joint.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
White joint?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Like you almost couldn't...

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Racist drugs.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
I think we talked about this

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
when we brought it up recently

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
in a Harmontown.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
The idea of the super cool,

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
remember that?

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Does anyone ever do that anywhere?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Do you ever put a PCP in a joint?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
One person, I think.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
It's called super cool?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Super cool.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
That sounds super cool.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
My friend friend did a super cool

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
outside of Jabberjaw.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Did you ever go to that?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Yeah.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
It was a great rock and roll venue

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
in kind of a shitty part of LA

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
on Arlington and Pico.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
And just for like Jabberjaw

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
and Bikini Kill

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
and all the kind of power,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
like carp and stuff like that,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
unwound, really great bands.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
And you could go there

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
and you could buy a joint

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
from a guy in the corner,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
but you only had PCP in it.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
And then you'd watch one of your friends

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
have a fucking nervous breakdown

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
in front of you.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Ugh.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
There's always those drugs

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
when the only time you hear about them

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
is when someone's explaining

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
why something fucked up happened

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
in like movies and stuff.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
So you always wonder,

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
like, you go like,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
why would anyone ever do a speedball?

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
I only ever hear about it

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
when someone dies.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Yeah.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
But there must be like a version

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
of a speedball where you like,

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
it's like really fun.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
I think, I think you,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
you probably do a speedball twice.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
The first time worked,

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
the second time didn't.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Yeah.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I'm going to Bogota, Colombia

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
to shoot something

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
and someone was telling me...

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
To shoot what, Steve?

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
A speedball?

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
To shoot what?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
To shoot this vein right there

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
with the purest cocaine, Jeff.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
But someone was telling me

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
they saw a vice documentary

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
on like this new drug.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And it's specific to Bogota

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
where I'm going where it's a powder

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
and they just blow it in your face

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
and all of a sudden you're fully

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
under their control

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
and they're like, come on,

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
let's go to the ATM

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
and you're like, okay, let's go.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
This is Serpent of the Rainbow.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
You're describing Serpent of the Rainbow.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Serping what?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Serpent in the Rainbow.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Yes.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Yes.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
That's what happened to Bill Pullman

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
except they put him in a coffin

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
instead of an ATM.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
But this is the thing

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
and you take out all your money,

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
give it to them

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
and you're just totally agreeable

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
and then you wake up the next day

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
and you're like, where's my money?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
But what if you're with a friend?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Can you blow it in your friend's face

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
and like you have a great night

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
or do you...

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
I think so.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Does anyone know about this drug?

23:23.000 --> 23:30.000
He saw it.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
Flowers grow on trees there?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Are you sure this is that weird

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
because I did a lot of cocaine in my 20s

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
and very often you'd have stuff

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
given to you

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
and end up walking to an ATM

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
and feeling very good

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
about some very dirty people.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
This is great.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
I'll tell my parents

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
I need twice as many groceries.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Anyways.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
So did we ever figure out

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
is it 90 minutes, two hours, an hour?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Andy told me you have two hours.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Oh, sweet.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Okay, good.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Because I'm just getting warmed up.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I'm just getting warmed up.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
They're going to call it

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Warmland pretty soon

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
because I'm going to...

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Okay, I'm done.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I'm done.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Wait, so if we do a two-hour show

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
the sun will still be up

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
and we're done.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yep.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
That's where they like it.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
I'll see someone funny.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Then we're all going to go to Union Jax

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
and do PCP.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Ooh.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Everyone come out to the...

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Yeah, there's some shows like that

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
so I heard somebody brought everybody

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
out to a parking lot

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
and there was Darth Vader

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
on a unicycle.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I would say 10 years ago

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
I went to Union Jax, I think by myself

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
because you go to strip clubs alone

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
and Union Jax, for those of you

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
that do not live in Portland

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
is one of Portland's shadier strip clubs

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
in a great way.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
And I think every girl there was a drug dealer

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
because I ended up with all of them

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
back in my hotel room

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
as there was a fucking

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
pharmacopeia of drugs there.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Every one of them opened up their purse

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
and had just wild ass

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
exotic class A drugs on them.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
It was really good.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
So we're going to Union Jax after this.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
We've established that.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
All right, so I want to bring

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
a friend that we made last night.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I was talking to our friend Jonah Ray

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
and he had this friend there

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
and I was talking to him

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
and part way into the conversation

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I was like, okay, stop.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
You should come on Harmontown

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
and talk about this stuff

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
and I promise it's a safe place

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
because what he was talking about

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
was very mythical

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
and I don't want to...

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
I'm a horrible interviewer

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
so I don't want to say at the top

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
why I thought he'd make an interesting guest

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
and then he comes out and goes like,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
well, what you said.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Let's explore it together.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
So let's explore him together.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
I mean, he's being really cool

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
coming here

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
and make him feel safe

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
and open your mind

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
and your heart to his humanity.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
No one does that in Portland, right?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Bill Pullman!

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Tom Hanks, everybody!

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Bill Pullman's the funniest question.

26:11.000 --> 26:18.000
I would have an amazing introduction

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
of just like a random cameo.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Pat and Mazel, guys,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
just open your hearts in your mind.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Open your heart to his humanity.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Andy Kindler, everybody.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
I want to say, Craig, are you up there?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Are you ready to come down?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Craig, bring it down here, would you?

26:35.000 --> 26:45.000
Craig Flippi, come down here.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Oh, shit, I should be.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
When you have a guest on your show,

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
it makes it good.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Sit anywhere you like.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Hello, Craig.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Sorry, I'm a little nervous when we go to town

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
so I'm less entertaining

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
and I have more guests.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
So, Craig, I met you last night

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
at the hotel

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
and then you started talking.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
He's like, there's layers here.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
There's layers.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Sure.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
First top layer, superficial layer,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
you're a bigfoot hunter.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Uh...

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
enthusiast.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
He's already a bigfoot enthusiast.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
You can't say hunter.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
You gotta really eat the mic.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
He's gotta eat the mic.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Well, there are guys,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
we talked a little bit about the bigfoot hunting community

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
and there's guys who want to kill bigfoot

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
and there's guys who want to protect bigfoot.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Yeah, so they don't say bigfoot hunters.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Some of them do,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
but that's like the Texas guys.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
They shoot to kill, basically.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
They want to shoot first

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
and ask questions later on bigfoot.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
There's so many questions.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Yeah, I know, there are a million questions.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
It's to protect the species, to have a body.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Can you divide the kill bigfoot people

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
into two people?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Are there people who want to kill bigfoot

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
to protect the species

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
and people who want to kill bigfoot

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
because they hate them?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Yeah, or they have like a polar bear already.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Like a rhino.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
How would killing a bigfoot

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
protect the species?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Well, you can study them.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Well, then you say, oh, okay.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
They must be in danger.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Yeah, these liberal assholes.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
It's even more endangered.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
If we just nut up and shoot the fucker,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
we could get one.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
But these liberal peaceniks

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
who are trying to trap them with a big box

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
and a carrot and a stick,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
that's why we haven't gotten one yet.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Let's get some more.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
But more importantly, I think the second layer

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
is that you're at kind of a crossroads.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Can I ask how old you are? Is that rude?

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Yeah, I guess you have to remember.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I think I'm 38.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
You think you're 38.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
You're roughly my age

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
and you're a little younger,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
but not by a significant factor.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Why am I talking about that?

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Who cares how our ages are different?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Forget about bigfoot.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
How many years are we apart?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
So your feelings about the Clintons

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
are a little more cynical.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
You can hum more bars

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
of video killed the radio star.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
But

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
what made me

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
kind of stop you and go,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
well, no, there were two things.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
The second layer is

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
you are kind of at this duality place

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
where you're comfortable with the idea

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
that bigfoot does not exist.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Right, yeah.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
You were like, do you think it exists or not?

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
And I'm like, I can't give you that

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
answer, sir.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
It's hard to be a bigfoot hunting

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
agnostic.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Yeah, that's a tough gig.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Yeah.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Because you're probably a sale on all

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
sites by...

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
I didn't touch anything.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I did not touch anything.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
That does make me think though

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
that when we're done with the brief conversation

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
we should have Spencer come out

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
and take Craig through

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
a role-playing bigfoot hunt.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
But it's just off the cuff.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I mean, that's how my mind works.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I could show you a few techniques.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Craig, what was the

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
origin for you,

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
your origin story of getting into the

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
bigfoot mythology?

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
This book's in the library

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
when I was a kid.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
And also, my dad

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
was always supposed to take me on an epic

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
bigfoot hunting journey. There's the third layer.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Yeah.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
That's when I stopped you and said,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
you need to come meet my friends.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
The first layer is he's a bigfoot hunter.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
The second layer is he's an agnostic bigfoot hunter.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
The third layer is the reason

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
he can do that is because

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
his fucking dad. And I started to weep

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
and...

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Because this is what

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
religion should be.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
This is folk mythology.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
It's self-created.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Yeah, I felt like I found Jesus.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
But...

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Craig, do you believe

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
that it's possible that there are such

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
things as Sasquatches?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Yeah, it's totally possible.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
If you really look into it,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
get down in the layers of it.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
The forests are bigger than we think.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Yeah, that was

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
one of the first turning points where

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
when I was out by myself and I'm looking

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
and I'm like, this is so fucking crazy.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
The first thing a crypto zoologist would tell

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
you is, I think,

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
you know,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
they'd start saying numbers.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
There's 70,000 species

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
that we've built and we've discovered

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
3,000 new ones a day and blah, blah, blah.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
The giant panda was discovered in like

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
32 or something? Yeah, there was like

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
a giant squid that someone discovered.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Or that new drug in Bogota,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Columbia.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
But okay,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
so let's start at what I think

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
is the core of the onion.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
An onion is a good metaphor because

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
you're gonna make me cry.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Let's start with your dad.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
You said your dad was supposed

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
to take you big for a curtain.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah, okay.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
You sound hesitant.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
When I was talking to you,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I was like, this is the whole fucking reason

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I'm doing this. It's like a dad thing.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
My dad fucking hit me

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
with the wrong end of the belt.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Your dad promised to take you.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Is it embarrassing you?

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I was never really talking

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
about it.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Take a tiny step by tiny step

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
and I will protect you the entire way.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I think.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I'm probably not good at that. Apparently

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
he was one of the best drug dealers

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
in Connecticut where I grew up.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Your father was?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
What qualified him as the best drug dealer

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
in Connecticut? I don't know.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
That's what his friend told me.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
He's like, dude, me and your dad,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I never trusted anyone like him.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
We'd go to bed in the same hotel room

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
with thousands of dollars

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
and wake up together.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
They started it weird.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
You lost your dad at what point?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I was 12 or 13.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Good age to lose a dad.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
It was perfect.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Nothing to damage there.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
My wife lost her mom

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
when she was a teenager.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
I often tease her about it.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
She's like,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
can I have the remote?

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
And I'm like, no, your mom died.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
You barely know what a mom is.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
We're watching Naked and Afraid.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
The funny part is that you're not joking.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Aaron's mad right now and it's not

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
because she's offended.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
It's because she's like, that's my act.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Oh, nice.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
She's like, I own that shit.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I make people uncomfortable with that.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Anyway, so...

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
He died in heroin overdose in Tenderloin.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Yeah, so to have a guy say,

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
your dad was the best at drugs.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Yeah, he did. He won.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
He won.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Yeah.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
But he had said to you,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
so this sounds a little bit like,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I hope my dad isn't listening,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
but I hope if my dad is listening,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I want my dad to know that I love him

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
and I don't judge him and I don't mean to vilify him,

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
but being a kid raised by somebody

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
who has another relationship with other stuff,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
whether it's workaholism

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
or booze or anything,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
you mythologize it

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
for a good reason.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
So my dad would,

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
he would get drunk

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
and he'd get really excited

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
about really specific stuff.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
We're going tobogganing tomorrow

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
and start fixing up the toboggan

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
and then he'd go just a quick nap

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
and then we're going to go tobogganing

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
and then it was Tuesday and it was like,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
what about the tobogga?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
There's spider eggs in it.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
We were building a robot together

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
and it has one arm still.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I was trying to make you feel safer

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
to talk about this.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
You brought up more memories.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
So your dad

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
who lost his life in that tragic way

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
who was obviously fighting that demon,

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
he had tried to have a relationship

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
with you and part of that was he told you...

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Yeah, he's like,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I'm going to fly you out to Bluff Creek,

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Northern California with a Patterson film,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
the famous.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
He's like, we're going to go there,

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
we're going to find one, blah, blah, blah.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I mean, that's not as...

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
And you were how old? Like 10?

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Yeah, like 10.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Which is like the height.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
You're Elliot in E.T.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Your mind is a sponge

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
and it's soaking in

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
like you're a goonie.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Pretty much.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Every day is an adventure

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
and he's just a guy

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
and he's saying to a kid...

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
You're going to make me cry now.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
So he's like, we're going to go,

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
my mom was separated,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
but she had these fucking scumbag guys

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
like, oh, sorry, this is live.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
This is going to get...

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Well, no, no, no, it's not live, but also...

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
I'll tell her not to listen.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Are you worried about your mom?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
We can lift something.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
If you say anything that you want lifted,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
we will lift it.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Speak freely from the heart if you decide later.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Because we have to edit it a little bit.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
So we're not live.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Amateur hour over here, sorry guys.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
So...

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Now I'm going to cry.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Now I'm crying.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Just heard something.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
So...

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
So a stepdad of sorts

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
says, oh, you want to find big foot out?

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
You find big foot boy?

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Oh, no.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Yeah, it started like off wrong

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
right away, right?

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
We hop in the truck

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
and he takes me out to the woods.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
This isn't going to be as bad as it sounds.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Okay, it's going to be...

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Thank God!

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Thank God!

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
That was the sound of...

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
That was a...

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
a 250-person

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
bow and arrow pulled out.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
And you said that and the arrow went...

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
We were all ready for...

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
anything.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Holy shit.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
All right.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
You want to meet big foot?

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
I'll show you big foot.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
He takes me to this field

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
and

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
and he's like...

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
It's still going to happen.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
It's just not as bad as he thinks it's going to be.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
All right, keep going.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
So he's like, oh,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
there's tons of big foot here.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
You just got to go look.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
You got to go look for the tracks.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
So I'm like, all jazzed up,

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
running through the field,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
looking and even then

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I was like, there's no fucking tracks here.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Like...

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
So he was just being kind of a deadbeat big foot hunter.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Yeah.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
It's just like a shitty, there's a train track.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
A Snipe Hunt.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Was he hazing you or was he just being lazy?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Was he trying to do good but he was just kind of shitty?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
He was drinking in the truck.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Do you think he was trying to

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
be a good dad or do you think he was

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
like actually being cruel to you?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
I think he was an alcoholic.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Like really bad.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
So I don't know what he was like.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Maybe he was nice but he didn't know.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Yeah, well I would project on to that

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
because I think part of

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
my history is

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I think kids tend to blame themselves

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
and then deify people

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
who are kind of their fuck ups.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
They're like, oh, he was being cool but

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
he meant well. So who knows maybe?

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
I don't know. I guess maybe...

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
I don't know. You have to know all about this guy.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
I don't know. He's just like, big foot doesn't exist.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Oh, so...

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
That's when you got back in the truck.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
That's like the equivalent of teaching you to swim by throwing you out of a boat.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
He's like, there's big foot out there.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Go find him. Two hours later, told you.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Doesn't exist. Yeah, exactly.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Show me a footprint. Fuck you. Let's go home

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
and watch Nova.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
So I quit after that.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Like soon after that I was just

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
like, you felt a little...

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Regardless of his intention,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
your experience was you felt a little humiliated

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
and chastened and you drew back.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I was like, oh, that's stupid to think that's real.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
And again, this is like something that your dad...

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
So then, okay, so then

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
what age were you when this got

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
reawakened in you?

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
27. It's awesome.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I mean, that's the age. That's the right age.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Right. I know you said that like

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
it should be 14. It should be...

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
You're an adult and all of a sudden you're...

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Carl Jung

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
described like

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
when he started exploring the collective unconscious,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
he's like, I need to understand this shit better.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
So what he focused on was his childhood

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
and he went and played in a sandbox.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Literally like he was just like, I'm gonna...

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Or maybe he had like little...

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
He used to like make little models when he was a kid.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
He did everything he could remember doing

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
when he was a kid, revisited that stuff

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
and he said his dreams started to become more

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
vivid and active

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
and he was able to analyze them better

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
when he was touching back.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
It makes perfect sense because the human mind

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
has two protocols.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
It's supposed to be adaptable,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
i.e. it's supposed to be able to make a world out of

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
anything around it, but also

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
it has to be like this spartan, vicious,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
nasty, calloused machine

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
that protects

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
everything that hurts it then gets turned

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
into a defense system.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
And so you're experiencing this duality

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
which is amazing because you're like

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
you've achieved every

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
person's dream really, which is like

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
you have a relationship with a thing

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
that doesn't need to exist or not exist

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
and it's about

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
the only, the first guy

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
you ever met who

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
created you and who made mistakes

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
and... Fought her.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
So now,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
I met your wife up there

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
and I couldn't get a read on her.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I don't know if she like...

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
She is...

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
You're a very lovely wife, Brianna.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Yeah.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
I have no idea. She described at one point

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
like you guys fell in love and like

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
you were talking about like, there was

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
a point in your relationship where the courtship

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
was over and you had sealed the deal and then one day

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
you were like, I got to go for three months.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
And you were like, wow, that's got to be

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
every woman's greatest dream.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Is the husband

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
at the foot of the bed putting on the camouflage jacket

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
and going, there's a creature out there.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Yeah.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
And she's like, now there is?

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Now?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Are you sure this isn't a reaction to

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
yesterday's breakfast?

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
What is going on?

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
But anyway...

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
So Craig,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
how much, like, actively,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
are you out in the field, like, actually

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
actively looking for Sasquatch?

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I just call it camping.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
You know, like...

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
So passive aggressive.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
So passive aggressive.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
That's great, though.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
That's perfectly...

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Oh, she got down again.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Dammit, chef.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Little camping music.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Well, let's...

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Okay, can we bring Spencer down at this point?

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Yeah, Spencer Crittenden!

42:33.000 --> 42:55.000
I don't know. I don't know how this is going to work.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
All right.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
If that falls,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
that's entertainment.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Maybe not.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
That looks like it's going to fall into the audience, Spencer.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I mean, you know...

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
That's going to impale Avalon's eye.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Avalon seems like a hearty guy.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Yeah, he can survive anything.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
His parents named him Avalon and he's walking.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
He's walking tall.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Spencer, it's always a delight to bring you

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
to Portland where you, like,

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
suddenly fit in.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
People, you know, you keep...

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
And Dustin, they share that.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Dustin Marshall, everybody.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I'm always so excited to see them

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
walk into a bar in Portland

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
when no one looks up, because

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
it's like bringing a baby tiger cub

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
to one of those preserves.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
And it jumps out the car window

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
and you're like, oh, I can't go.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
What do you mean by that, though?

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
This is like the second third time

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I've heard a baby tiger all this.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I don't know

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
what are you guys like

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
that I'm also like?

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
You just cut the silhouette of a Portlandier.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
I wish I did.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I mean, I'm the silhouette of, like,

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
all sorts of, like, an Arkansas man

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
or, like, any guy

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
that wields some sort of cutting implement.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Like, I have...

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
I match a lot of trucker.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I match a lot of silhouettes.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Yeah, but it's this response

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
that makes you fit in here.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Because if I...

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
If I took you to Arkansas,

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
someone might go,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I bet he can saw real good.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Also the fact that you

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
walked down Burnside

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
with a blue ox.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I think a lot of people...

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Well, that's just bad.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
You have a beard and you're large

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
and a little zen.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
That's not how I view Portlandiers.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Very passive aggressive.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Well, I guess beard.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
And practical.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
And...

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
I don't think Portlandiers are practical.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
No offense, Portland.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Oh, my God.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
How do you think they're impractical?

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I'd say they're the picture of impracticality.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
All right, well, let's...

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
I think they're ready to hear it.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Give it to them.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
All right, Portland, give me something to make fun of.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Tall bikes.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
What?

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Is that a practicality thing?

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
That's just... That's feeding me.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Gold.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
I've got to spin something into it.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Donuts.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Don't, don't. They're a sponsor.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
The dark underbelly of Portland.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Controlled by big donut.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Well, I mean...

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Donuts are a very practical food, though,

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
like you could string them on a rope and you're good to go.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
All right.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
You're a contrarian.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
You should take you to the state of contraria.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Is that what Portland is?

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
No.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
I don't know. You look like a lumberjack. That's it.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Well, I guess, see,

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I don't picture Portland as a lumberjack city.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Maybe I'm wrong. I mean, they could be.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Are you guys lumberjacks?

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
If you can hunt Bigfoot here,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
anywhere you can hunt Bigfoot,

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
you can shrink the forest.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Jack's lumber?

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
There's forest to be turned into paper and stuff.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
All right. Well, Spencer, all right.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
This is...

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I got off on the wrong foot with you.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Well, I'm sure you're right.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
I think I've agitated you.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I've aggroed you in video game terms.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
But I was wondering...

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
We have to walk a tightrope if we do this,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
but I really believe we can do this.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Like, it just came up

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
off the top of my head that Craig's up here.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
He's a really fucking cool,

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
smart sport, super sensitive.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
He's, like, bared his soul

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
to a totally supportive group of people

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
who are in this town hall,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
or in this amazing city

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
that sits atop the bosom of the ocean

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
and doesn't reward people

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
for his sweatiness and ambition

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
and dishonesty and says, like,

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
whoever you are is who you are.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Even the homeless people are comfortable

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
and they have backpacks.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
They have homeless. They have dogs and wives.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
How do you get that many tattoos if you're homeless?

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Like, tattoos are like...

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
That's like having a hot tub.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
That's something you get after you get a home.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
But that's me being

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
from California thinking that way.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
That's ridiculous. I'm like, Tim Allen.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
So, anyways...

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
It's a good place to do it.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
It's a good experiment. You're young.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Craig is awesome.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Like, Bigfoot mythology.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Could we experiment

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
with doing just a quick

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
like, kind of like a campaign,

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
like a role-playing campaign?

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Could you find, like,

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
the nature guide in you

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
to, like, create a quick campaign

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
where our car breaks down

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
and we go into the woods and something happens

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
that can

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
help Craig achieve

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
just weightlessness

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
and a tone

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
with the cosmos?

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Fathers!

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Spencer, do you want to give it a whirl?

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
I don't. Wait, what?

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
No, you can't.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
It wouldn't work.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Just try it out.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Can you do an RPG for us right now

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
where it's a Bigfoot world?

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
The four of us,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Dan Craig, Steve and I are in a car.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
The car breaks down.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
We're just outside of Portland.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
And maybe this is Sasquatch.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
You're just describing it.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
We're going to create a simulation

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
where Craig gets to catch Bigfoot.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Spoilers.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Well, what

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
system should we use?

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Warhammer.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Let's do, like, a pathfinder.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
A lot of you are in audio.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
That was the sound of my eyeballs on the back of my head.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Let's do, like, a pathfinder,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
kind of simple, like, D&D kind of thing.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
All right.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
All right, Spencer, this is a curved bobble.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Let's let her up.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Let's just try it.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Let's see if we can come up with an intro.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Aren't you glad we smoked all that weed, Spencer?

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
What's the worst that can happen, Steve?

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
I mean...

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Last time on Harmontown.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Wait, no.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
You...

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
It's been two hours since the car broke down,

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
and you've yet to see signs

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
of human life

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
on the road.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Glows come from south.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
You think that you might be able to make it back to town,

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
but the quickest way is through the woods.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
You're not sure

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
how to proceed, whether you should

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
leave the safety of your car

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
and vent your outer.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Stay safe inside.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Go.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Who's driving?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
It's a broken down car.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Who's at the wheel?

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
I can't get any reception out here, dude.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
I think we have to walk.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
He's at the wheel?

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
He's kicking ass right now is what he's doing.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
There's like...

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
I'm AT&T.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Is anyone else not on AT&T?

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I got no bars out here.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I'm on Verizon.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
I got nothing.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
I used my power

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
to talk to animals,

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
and I...

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I call out,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Chipmunk!

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Your cry

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
echoes out in the woods.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
You hear the scattering of birds,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Chipmunks.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Did you roll that?

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
He doesn't have any dice,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
but why are you saying

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
you have the power to talk to Chipmunks?

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
That's insane.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
It's worth a fucking try.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
No.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
I mean, I don't want to be critical,

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
but if I was, it would go something like this.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Steve just blew

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
some of that Bogota powder in my mouth.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I don't know

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
I don't know when it's going on.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I talk to all the Chipmunks

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
and it's like, do you have dice?

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Did you roll that?

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Let's get serious.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
This is why system is important.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I say even though Dan, I know what you're going to say,

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
because you're the adventurer, Ted,

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
that wants to walk through the woods

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
rather than get back in the car

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
and they tell you to stay put when you get lost.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
They tell you that?

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
You didn't even know that.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
You're probably going to say

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
let's just wander towards that glowing part

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
in the woods and let's roll the dice.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Do you know

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
that this neighborhood of the woods

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
is supposed to be lousy

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
with Sasquatch?

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
You actually believe in Sasquatch?

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Yes, I do and I'll tell you why.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Fuck you, we're going through the woods.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Fuck you, Steve.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Well, wait a minute, this guy we're traveling with, Craig.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Yeah, you guys didn't know this

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
about me up until now, but

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
um...

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
We were just

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
out cabinet shopping with you

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
because you also are into woodwork.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I love

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
polishing steel

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
to a mirror finish.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
The best wood.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
That's what you want to call it, Craig.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
And so, what do you think?

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Is this Bigfoot Country?

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Definitely Squatchy, bro.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Yeah.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Yeah.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Squatchy.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
That guy tried to

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
initiate a standing O that I approve of.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Squatchy.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Squatchy.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
As far as it's Squatchy,

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
shit, man.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Look, guys, I'm a pragmatist.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
We'll freeze to death tonight.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
There's glowing in that direction.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
In our wildest dreams, we'd stumble upon

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
a creature

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Oh, it's Bigfoot.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
They travel, guys,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
they travel like lights through the forest sometimes.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
What?

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
That sounds like new age.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Well, it's one faction.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
I use my low light vision to look for the forest.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
You're not...

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Just follow us.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Why would we be excited

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
to find Bigfoot if you were an elf?

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
You're a guy, you're just...

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
You're you, you're a guy.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I'm just trying to have fun, Dan.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
We're out in the woods.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
We're trying to make the best of a bad situation.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Okay, so...

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Look, he doesn't have low light vision.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
We're human beings.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
It's 2015.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
We're broken down in a car.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
It's freezing.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
We're going to die if we stay here.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Chipmunk!

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
I'm getting out of the car

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
and I'm going to at least walk

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
towards the glow until I get bars on my phone.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Craig, I'd appreciate it if you came with

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
because you seem rugged.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Yeah, bro.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
I got a map pocket on this jacket, so yeah.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
A map pocket?

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Like, what do you mean?

54:27.000 --> 54:33.000
Alright.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Yeah.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
But no map?

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Cell phone.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
They're better download apps.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Alright.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Where's the glow?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
To the south.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Head south.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I don't believe in Bigfoot,

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
but if we do run into one,

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
he's the guy to have with us.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
So let's just go.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
We need to kill one to save them

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
on this.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
If we do find one,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
okay, we're killing it.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I think there's enough of us that we can do it.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
We're all agreed right now.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
If we see a Bigfoot, kill it.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Yeah, we're all coincidentally,

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
even though we're now first being asked

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
what kind of Bigfoot enthusiast we are,

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
we're all in the Ted Nugent camp.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Just by coincidence.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
We're going to eat it too.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Spencer, we move south.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
As you're trudging south,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
the glow gets brighter.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Behind you, you can hear rustling of leaves

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
and you check behind you,

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
but you see nothing.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Chipmunks.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
There's no chipmunks around here.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
I called out earlier, nothing happened.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
It's your phone chirps.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
One of you might have reception.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I look at my phone.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Still no bars, not me.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Not me, man.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Oh, shit.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
It's an old, I'm sorry,

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
it's an old push notification from Instagram.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Craig and I got our phones mixed up

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
because mine was in his map pocket.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
You should look at your phone again.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Yeah, I got them.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
What does he got?

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
It sounds like reception.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Oh yeah, you get reception?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Yeah, check it out.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Alright, cool.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
What's your text message from your grandpa?

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Oh.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
It is.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
It says...

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
What does it say?

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I can't quite read it.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Can you?

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
It says...

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
I use my low light vision to read his text message.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Dammit, goddammit.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
So close, so close to intimacy.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
It says,

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
hey kiddo, remember

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
that knife you have?

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I took it from you. You don't have it anymore.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
I'll see you at home.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Alright, typical grandpa.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
That was fucked up.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Alright.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
I break a branch off of a tree

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
and as we walk

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
I sharpen it with a stone

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
just in case.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Shit.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I pull out my emerald dagger.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
As you near the glow

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
you can hear.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
We were in a car! Why would you...

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
I never go into a forest

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
without bringing my emerald dagger

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Dan, and you know that.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
As you near the glow

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
you can hear

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
the crunching

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
of something crunchy

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
as well as low rumbling growls

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
that sound like some sort of

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
animal.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Is it coming from where we're walking to?

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
It's coming from the

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
source of the glow

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
or that direction at any rate.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Are you supposed to scare him?

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Well, first you gotta

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
test the sitch.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Is this a quadruped

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
or a biped coming towards me?

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Okay.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
You're in charge now.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
I think I heard two footsteps

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
but it could have been four.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
I'm pretty drunk.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Are we supposed to...

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Are we supposed to...

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Is the idea of a bear attack

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
that you're supposed to play dead?

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I wish a bigfoot would attack me.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
We're with that guy.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Guys,

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
why don't we form a perimeter?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Let's try to surround it a little bit.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
I go, get out of here!

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Get out of here!

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
How close are we to the glowing?

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
How close?

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
You can't see the source of it.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
If I climb a tree,

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
will I be able to get a good look at it?

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Perhaps.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Holy shit!

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Agee?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
In the complete darkness.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Dude, I haven't done this since I was 10!

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
This is awesome!

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Holy shit!

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
This is a mountain goat.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
He's way up there.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I see something.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Yeah.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
You see the glow.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
The source of the glow, rather.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
It seems like it used to be a campfire.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Some sort of fiery camp.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
It's been

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
scattered, scattered and destroyed.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
And all you can see is the glowing embers

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
as well as shadows lurking around

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
the source of the fire.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Let's keep going towards the fire, guys.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
You guys go to the fire!

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
It's a fire?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
There's a campfire.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
The dying embers of a campfire over there.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
What Jess said.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I go up and examine.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I look for tracks.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Where?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Around the campfire.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Okay, well, you gotta get to the campfire first.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I run headlong.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
You run headlong

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
to where the source of the glowing is.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
You see

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
footprints all around.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I examine them. What do they look like?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Big footprints.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I reach into my knapsack

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
and I pour an alginate cast into it

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
to make a track

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
to make a footprint cast of it.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Not before I do.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Dan, you know I bring

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
an emerald dagger and alginate

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
wherever I fucking go.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Okay, well, I assume

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
after a while because we didn't charge headlong

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
we get there too.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
That also happens.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
We find him pouring a cast.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
What are you doing?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Craig, what the fuck are these?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I'm preserving what appears to be

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Sasquatchi and...

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
This campfire is Squatchy, man.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Craig, what do you think?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Dude, did you just dump that plaster in

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
without splatter?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Do anything with splatter technique first?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Jeff?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I don't know the first one.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I can't believe you didn't know this.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
What?

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
When you find the print,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
first you just splatter a little bit

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
all over the place, just splatter.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
So there's no air pockets, right?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Just to get the nice coat there.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Because when you dump it in,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
it distorts the evidence.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Oh, because of the weight of the alginate.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
There's more footprints.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
There's loads of footprints.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
There's only one at a time.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Oh, that's why they don't call him Big Feet.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
That makes sense.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
He only ever leaves one print.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
All right.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Well, he's doing that.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Is it an actual burning campfire?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Because that's a bigger deal than any footprint

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
that someone made of fire.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Yeah, you see, it's not a proper fire,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
but there's definitely burn

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
burning and burned

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
logs and wooden pieces

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
that were arranged together.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
They've been scattered as if someone tried to

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
drop kick or quickly put out the fire

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
in haste to make a hasty retreat.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
But we saw the glow.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
That means we're upon entities

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
that we were coming in.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
This is Squatchy.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
There's a Big Foot track here.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
We caught Big Feet.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I examine the ground for any, like,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
spore or hair or any kind of like

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
amateur, amateur.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Oh, spore.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Well, Craig, what would you do?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
This is where we're going to live

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
for a while.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Guys.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I thought we were hiring into civilization.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
What's this guy talking about?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Wow, all right.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I cast magic sleeping bag.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
So then,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
okay, let's live here.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And then, uh...

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Let's move it together.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Magical sleeping bag pops into existence.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Can we advance time

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
and we've lived there a while?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Sure.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
How long do you want

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
to have advanced time?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
We've all got beers and we have our own alphabet.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Wait, wait, we're...

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I've also carved

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
a rocking chair out of a sequoia.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
All right, those things happen.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Steve and I are married.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
We have an agreement

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
that when we get back,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
we won't talk about it, but

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
we're doing what we have to do

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
to survive inside.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
We're Mount Married.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And I proved Big Foot exists to four people.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
All right.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
So we're there.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
This is the key morning.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
We wake up.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
You're waked up.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
There's a campfire.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
It's burning.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
You've been maintaining it

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
for however long you've been there.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
All right.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
You hear footsteps

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
approaching from the north.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Here it is.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
It's coming, guys.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
It's burning firewood, man.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
They're cutting all this shit.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I know, this place is like a parking lot now.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
A couple more trees

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
and we have to start a rock concert.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I just, out of idle curiosity,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
go towards the sound of the footsteps.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
You go towards the sound of the footsteps

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
and you see an old barefoot

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
and, man, holding a rifle.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Oh, shit.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
It's only a game, sir.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
It's only a game.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Does he look like a...

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
He's a human being?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Oh, he's the humanist of beings.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I look at his feet,

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
so I know it's not one of those old gags.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
What?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
He doesn't have giant feet, right?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
No.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Just holding a rifle.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Old man,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
take a look at our lives.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
What's that?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
We're a lot like you.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
That's Neil Young.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
We're just here looking...

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Originally, we were trying to find a gas station,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
but

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
we are now looking for Bigfoot.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
What's your name, old man?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Skeeter.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Y'all look like some big feats.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
No.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
No, I mean...

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
We're good people.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
We're improving.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I dropped my pants and...

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I mean, I...

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
We're wearing clothes for a while.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I throw my emerald dagger at his heart.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
All right.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Well, I mean, okay.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
You know what?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I stop and I go meta for a second.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I guess my goal was to, like,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
meet Bigfoot and

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
have Craig, like, start crying

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
as he touched Bigfoot's face.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
But you know what?

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
What business is that of mine?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Why am I trying to turn his passion

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
and his religion into my sideshow bullshit?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Why are you playing God?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Yeah. I think it's fantastic that he...

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Honey, why are you playing God?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Yeah.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
That he came up here and shared his...

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I think the most amazing thing is, like,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
that this thing keeps going and going and going.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Are you going to continue to go out there and...

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
This is the 10-year anniversary

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
of when I took a moped trip

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
through the Pacific Northwest.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Did you say moped?

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Yeah, a moped.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Right now is a 10-year anniversary

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
of the last time I heard someone say moped.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Yeah.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Your goal, you're kind of, like,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
tempting fate, like, you want to get lost.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
You want the...

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Yeah, I had the shittiest maps and maps blew off

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
my little basket I made

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
and just... I'm like, oh, don't know where that...

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
How to get anywhere now.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
This is after that morning with Briana

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
and you're like, I got to go find a monster

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
and then 30 miles out, you're like, whoops!

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Yeah.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
No, you love her very much, I'm sure.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
The...

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
So it's the 10-year anniversary,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
like, you...

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
and you're still plunging in here after...

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I'm thinking I'm going to go on another trip,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
but slightly shorter,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
since we have a kid, like,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
six weeks, five weeks.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Maybe take the kid into the woods and, like,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
look at the denseness of the...

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
that thing can happen.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
This is where... this is the cosmos.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Yeah, I'm not going to tell him, like,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
you know, Pigfoot does or doesn't exist,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
but, like, I don't want to live in a world

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
where I have to say, Pigfoot doesn't exist.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Yeah. Or that he does.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Yeah.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
The human mind is capable of anything.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
That's amazing. You have the opportunity now

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
to go do what your stepdad did wrong.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Failed. You failed father.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Yeah. It's to go out there

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
and give your son an adventure

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
exactly what it... whatever it wanted to be.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Yeah, what it should have been

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
in the first place. That's so beautiful, man.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
All right, that's beautiful. If you see Craig out there

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
buying a drink and don't get invasive

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
and...

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
but understand... I got the right...

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I got a good crotch gusset.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
You got wet?

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
My pants.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
His crotch got wet

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
from the condensation on his cup.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Oh, okay. I thought...

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
So if you see him out there, he didn't wet his pants.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Thank you.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I was saying buying a drink and I thought he was going like,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I can't and then there was like pee.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I can't. They can't buy me a drink.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
They can't.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
When you're bigfooting in the woods, you can't...

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
There's no time to go take a leak.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
All right, well, let's have a hand for Craig.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Give him a warm hug out there.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Yeah.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
That's...

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
That's Portland

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
and that's humanity.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
That's...

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I just broke my teeth on the microphone.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
That's...

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I don't know.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Well, I don't know. Somehow that...

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
there's some intersection there.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
The Northwest mentality.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
The human species.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
The idea that you bring with you.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
This giant brain that can create anything.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
It takes all the weird shit that goes into it.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
A bunch of pain and a bunch of pleasure and it spits out

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
like...

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
anything.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And those things can be passed on to people

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
or they can heal them.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
We don't give ourselves enough credit as a species

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
because what are giraffes doing right now?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
They're not having a podcast.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
They're...

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I'm not saying they should be extinct,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
but they haven't earned shit.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
They're fucking horses that were like,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I want to eat that apple.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
They're garbage animals.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
They've had longer time on this planet

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and they did not create Wi-Fi.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Just saying.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
If we were to talk to them,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
right now they'd be like,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
could we make a neck that could get to the moon?

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
That would be their solution.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
They'd be like, maybe we can eat the moon.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
They'd be like, no, the earth is a fucking burnt crisp

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
because they don't last long on these planets.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
We're assholes.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
We're a horrible animal.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
We're a hyper-intelligent chimpanzee

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
that decided that we would take all this power

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
and fuck things up,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
but we're also maybe going to get some of those giraffes

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
and they will thank us later

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
when we give them the power to speak.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
We'll be like, ladies and gentlemen,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
it's 2078 AD.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
We're orbiting on Zoo One

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
and the first giraffe is about to speak.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
What do you have to say, Jeffrey?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Thank you.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
You're welcome, motherfucker.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
You're welcome.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
You're coming down awfully hard

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
on giraffes right now, Dan.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I hate giraffes.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I think they represent everything that humans don't

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
because it's all adaptation and no risk.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I think having an enormous neck is a huge risk.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
No, it's not. It's not at all.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
It's the opposite of risk.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
No, I'm telling you, there's a principle in evolution that's like...

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
It's so establishable.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
If there's a biologist in the audience,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
there's two principles of evolution.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
One is becoming hyper-compatible with your environment.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
So the extreme example of that is the hummingbird

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
because it has like this beak

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
that's really designed for a certain flower.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
If that flower goes extinct,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
the hummingbird is fucked.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
On the other end of that spectrum,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
we have the things that we admire, which is adaptability.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
We have a weird robot claw

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
that is designed to grab random shit.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
So you can drop us on the North Pole.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
You can drop us anywhere.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
No matter where you drop us,

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
we'll live long enough to fuck it up.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
But for a long time,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
following that strategy made us the food

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
of wolves and cats.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
These biological killing machines

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
and they were like, where do you think you're going with this garbage?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
You're walking upright.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
You look like idiots. I'm going to eat you.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
And your babies are pudding.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Your babies are made of pudding.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And one in two of them die

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
and they cry when they need to be picked up,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
which is a dinner bell.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
You are doing everything wrong.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
But it's like, it's a gamble.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
It's a gamble. And now every primate is dying off,

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
not just because of us, but it's like,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
we did it. We fucking took this planet.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
We fucking took it.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
We were not supposed to.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I like the idea of... Bees were supposed to.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Fuck bees.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Fuck them.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
What's wrong with bees?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I'm not mad at bees. I forget I'm in Portland.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I like the idea of taking a child out

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
and going to do something as

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
arbitrary and mythological

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
and probably nonsensical.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Let's go find a bigfoot.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
That makes much more sense than going fishing.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
You're going to eat that mic, bro.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
You're going to eat that mic.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
They can hear me.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I'm sorry, I wasn't attacking it.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I was just worried that they couldn't hear you.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
You go fishing.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
You're just casting a hook

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
into the water, which is a subconscious,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
which is like the unseen.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
The whole point of going fishing is to sit there

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
and waste time and connect with somebody else

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
that you're with. I think it's just as

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
likely to have fun and be more important

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
and go monster hunting.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I think that's very cool. I like that a lot.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
It's not like we don't find monsters

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
every day.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
There are so many species.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Even tonight, you might find

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
a monster.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Let's bring

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
my

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
eternal muse, the other half of my existence.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Jonah Ray, everybody!

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Jonah Ray is here!

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
My

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
beautiful wife,

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
the son of my solar system,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Erin McGathy.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Erin McGathy!

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Erin McGathy wearing wet socks.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
My Quaker

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Anne of Green Gables couture.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I bought this in Portland.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Everything I'm wearing is by a Portland

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
person.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
It's $8,000.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
It's what the discriminating

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Flemish

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
lady is wearing this

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
300 years ago.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
When we burn you at the steak,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
we're going to know why.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Because you're hot.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Not a pun on fire.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Because you're sexy and sexy women

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
are the victims

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
of misogyny.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Break it down.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Sexy women must burn!

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Unless they take over.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I loved Squatch Finder.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
It was great.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Couple notes.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Happy Mother's Day, everybody.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I would have sent

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
my mother flowers, but

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
there's this groundskeeper at the cemetery

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
to help me.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I told you.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
That's been a show. Good night, everybody.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
She's like the Mad Max

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
of Dead Mom Jokes.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
When you find a can of dog food,

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
you know how to

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
eat most of it.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Then the dog gets the can and you're like,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
don't take my Dead Mom Jokes.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
It's sad.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Would you tease me about it sometimes?

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Sometimes it does make me feel bad

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
and...

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
That's a relief.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Sometimes.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
This is the best.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
No, it's great.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I like joking about it.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Did you wish your mom would have taken you

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
to do something as interesting and specific

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
as Sasquatch Hunting?

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
She took me to Michael's a few times.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Did you buy some yarn?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Needle point?

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
My mom used to make

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
rice dolls

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
which were her

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
own invention, I think,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
which were bags.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
She would buy fabric and fill it with raw rice

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
and then put a wooden head on top

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
and they would be female heroines

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
from literature

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
and they were pretty sad.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
No, I thought they were great.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
My mom was a very creative person.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I feel like

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I'm going to see her head floating.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
You made little rice

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Anna Karina's?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Well, there was Anna Green Gables.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
There was

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Elizabeth Bennett from Pride and Prejudice.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Anna Karina I think is too...

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I think all the characters she wanted

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
to explain to me what happened in the end

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
and not have it be weird.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
You should start making those again

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
and sell them as iPhone

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
waterlogged iPhone savers

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
where you put them

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
in the women's mouths

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
into the rice.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
What do you think of

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
your... I don't know if this is

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
a huge precipice to fall off of,

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
but I'm just curious when you make a joke

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
about your mom's floating head being here,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
do you think about your mom

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
and imagine what she would say

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
if she was watching you

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
and what do you have

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
thoughts about that stuff?

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Oh, if my mom were here right now.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Yeah, I mostly imagine

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
her glare.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I mean, there's no...

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I wish I...

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Yeah.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Do you dream about her?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Did she ever come to you?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I do. This is very sad.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I dream about her very frequently

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
and the dream is always us hanging out

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
and me saying, I thought you were dead.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
And her saying, oh, no, no, no, no.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
No, I'm totally alive

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
and everything's fine.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I'm like, let's hang out and now you're an adult.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
And I'm like, this is the best.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I've been dead for so long and then I wake up

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
and pick up the phone.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
At the end of those dreams, do you go to bed

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
because you might be like that guy

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
in that short-lived conceptual cop show

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Awake, what's it called?

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Like, you might be living two lives

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
that are both equally real.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Like, maybe your mom is alive

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
and then you're going to sleep

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
and then this is the dream.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I should search for my mom with Craig

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
in the forest.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Chipmunk!

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
What did you think of Jeff's behavior in that game?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
You know, I...

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I was trying to have fun.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I mean, I enjoyed...

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I was trying to help us find Bigfoot.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I enjoyed the banter, but I guess I was on Jeff's side.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Oh, okay.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
We brought too much supernatural power

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
to search for Bigfoot.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
It just kind of undercut the...

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
We agreed that we were playing a Pathfinder version of that game.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I thought they don't have special skills

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
and abilities.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I mean, I don't want to give anyone notes,

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
but, Dan, why'd you

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
scare away the Bigfeet?

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Like, you're coming towards them

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and then you heard something

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
and then you're like, get out of here!

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And then they all ran away.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I was trying to summon magical creatures

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
to find the Bigfeet.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Someone said, let's make a perimeter

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
and then you just negated that and said,

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
get out of here!

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
You didn't want to find Bigfoot.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
What's wrong with you? Who in the show?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I'm the bad guy!

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
What I was doing was I was like...

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
We just care about you!

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
And you shut us down!

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Why don't you gobble your milk?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Kettle.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I didn't perceive what I was doing

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
in that moment as being counterproductive.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I perceived it as the opposite.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I was getting a little tipsy at that point.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
That's what Michelini said.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
You want to know the truth. Here's a high road for you.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I was worried about you.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I was thinking about you up there and you're like,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
what the fuck is this Bigfoot thing taking forever?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
You'll be thinking about her.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
She doesn't know about that.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
From her perspective, it's like we were in space

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
traveling at the speed of light.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
You didn't like that I was breaking the reality

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
of us out in the woods being actual people?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
If you have an emerald dagger and low-light vision

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
and you meet a Bigfoot, wouldn't you just be like,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
who cares?

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I think if you have so many rules for it.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
That was my problem.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Thank you for defending me, Erin. I appreciate that.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
You're welcome. First and last time.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
I made a huge mistake.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I do this on community too.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Everything that I plan,

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
every time I get an idea and I'm like,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
we should do that, that's when the trouble starts.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Everything that I'm like, oh fuck it.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I don't know, just this. That's what makes people happy.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
How did you see that ending in your head

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
when we started?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I'll tell you the truth. You asked an honest question.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
It deserves an honest answer and I'm going to embarrass myself

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
and I'm the one that needs help. I'm fucked up.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Please appreciate my candor. Reward it.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Don't judge me.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I truly

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
thought in my head,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
there was some moment where

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
we came to a clearing and

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Bigfoot was there and Spencer

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
in all of his, I'm going to say

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Aspergerie, it's an overused phrase.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Spencer's detachment,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
which I share with him, his compartmentalization,

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
it would all add up to this crazy thing.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
It would be like the celebration

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
of how we're all fucked up

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
and nerdy and detached,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
it would all combine in this network

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
to create this nerdy role-playing

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
thing where this guy who

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
was really smart and sensitive was

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
actually fucking touched Bigfoot

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
and that we would all burst into

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
3,000 tears.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
And that was

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
my mistake. Why would I decide

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
that's the future and then try to make

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
a beeline for that instead of just embracing the moment?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I didn't meet that guy by planning to meet him.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
I met him organically.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I'm not being glib. Why then

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
do you think it's instinct to scare Bigfoot off of it?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I thought it was taking too long

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
so I thought maybe that would make

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Bigfoot come out.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
If I said get out of here, get out of here,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I thought Spencer would go

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
lumbering down the trees.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Because Spencer's kind of a contrarian

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
so I thought if I said get out of here

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I thought I could trick Spencer into punishing me

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
by having a Bigfoot not get out of there.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Because Spencer would be like

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
don't tell me what to do.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Bigfoot's come from everywhere

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
because you said get out of here.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
The trees turned into Bigfoot.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
You know, I think the role playing

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
session went over really well.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I don't think you should

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
fish for that. I don't think they're falling for it

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
because they're from Portland. Oh, I wasn't.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Yeah, I don't care what they think.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
They live in a world where somebody sets up a donut shop

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
and is like I think these donuts are all right.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
How many of you out there were disappointed

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
when I summoned Chipmunk?

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
The Chipmunk did not appear.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
We all wanted that, right?

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
But we're talking in circles,

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
but I just think if you're on a Bigfoot hunt

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
the scale comes down to Bigfoot has to be

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
the most amazing thing you've ever encountered.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
So like if you watched

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
contact with Jodie Foster and there were like

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
aliens working with her

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
hey, hey, Nim num

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
do you have a reading on the Foxtrot 7?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Me bop boop bop boop bop boop

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Okay, let's keep trying to make

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
contact. He's a fucking

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
she's talking to a worm creature.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I'm a writer.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I'm a writer.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
It's kind of like being a bounty hunter

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
like I'm not officially allowed

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
to have more respect, but I should have it.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
That's why I put myself out there a lot.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I've been through some shit. I'm like dog the bounty hunter.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I enjoyed it.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I would like to actually do more.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I feel like for the first, we only played for what

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
10 or 15 minutes of that, right?

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
I think that was a good first 10, 15 minutes.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I would like to play more of that

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
like us meeting Bigfoot role-playing

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
game would be very fun.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Could I be the chipmunk?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Yes, Erin. Thank you.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
In the marriage of Steve Agee and Dan Harmon,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
let's say it continued.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
What would a lazy Saturday be like

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
for you guys?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Oh, it wouldn't be lazy

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
for us though.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
What time do you wake up? Do you guys

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
eat together? Like what does that look like?

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
It was a weekend?

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Yes, it was a Saturday.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Just our bed of pine needles.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I feel like it would work.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I feel like it would work really well.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Because I feel like Agee and I are

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
two lazy motherfuckers.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I feel like I'm really mean to you

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
unfairly because you're too symbolic

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
because you're my wife.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
There's all these tickets you didn't buy

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
so I'm mean to you

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
for artificial dishonest reasons.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
So if I was in a

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
weird relationship,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
oh god, it's just called gay people weird.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
If I was

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
in an awesome

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
relationship,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
one that was unexpected to me

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
with Steve,

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
it would force me

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
to stop playing recordings of my dad

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
when I talk to my partner and I think

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
when I'm mean to you, it's not

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
me. I mean, I ship it.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Okay, good.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Well, let's do it.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
No, I should just think of you

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
as Steve Agee. That's the thing.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Yes, I could do it.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Hey,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I'll show up everywhere

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
first.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I'm always saying when we have fights

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I think this is how everybody probably

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
has frustrations because the person that you're

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
with, there was that whole high fidelity

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
monologue where it's like the people

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
that we love, that we take the closest

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
to us, they are treated to these really

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
unfair metrics.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
You watch a stranger walk down the street

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
and her ratty panties aren't hanging from

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
our curtain. That was that monologue.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
No, I'm not saying it. Don't get distracted.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Don't get distracted by that.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
That's a metaphor for the fact that

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
the people that we're with every day,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
we're being so unfair to them, but they're the people that we trust.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
And it has to do with self-loathing

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
because we like the way we look through strangers' eyes

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
because we hate ourselves.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
We're actually being more dishonest when we first

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
meet somebody and then

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
we slowly gain intimacy, which should be a

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
gateway to unprecedented levels of

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
honesty and instead sometimes there's a little

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
plant that comes down and you go like,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
well, this person knows me now and I'm kind of ashamed

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
of myself and you start to play out these

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
operas that you saw your parents play out.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
I'm not blaming anything.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
We should all work towards it, but that's what happens.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
I'm ashamed of myself when I fight with you

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
because I hear myself

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
saying things that I don't actually

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
feel. I just have a relationship

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
and then the relationship is making

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
me go like, well, I should

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
be mean right now.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Can we try something?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Because I have a new tactic.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
We're going to do a little role play.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
We're at

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
a frozen yogurt place.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
You're at a frozen yogurt place.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
This one

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
you're into.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
You scared the Sasquatches.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
It's like pulling fucking teeth to get us in the woods

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
and meet Bigfoot.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
You scared him away.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I'm just a world simulator, Dan.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I don't have thoughts.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Just try to react as

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
we're at a yogurt shop.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
We're sitting down, we're eating yogurt.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Can I get another?

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Oh God, she's the best.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Has anyone given her a medal?

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
That's Tori.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
I like that it's scaled down, so I won't notice.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
It's a slightly smaller cup.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Can I get a whiskey, please, on the rocks?

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
What do you want? Whiskey?

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
A whiskey, please?

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Nice try, Uncle Bob.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
One for my lawyer over here.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
That's Tori, I'll forget to thank him later.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
That's Tori and then Mandy.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Tori, two whiskeys on the rocks, please, if you don't mind.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Thank you, Mandy, and thank you,

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
the people over there that are giving you drinks

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
and dealing with this giant one.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
It's like chilled Casadores.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
We're at a yogurt shop.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
And just react as honestly.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Just react how you would react,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
reading our yogurt.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Are we all here or just you two?

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
It's just us. You guys are waiting in the car.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
I have...

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I have an emerald dagger.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
All right.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Jeff, you...

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Jeff...

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I love that that culminated in a high five.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Jeff sucks dick like one of those water birds.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Yeah, he does.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
But he's so good at it, that's how it works.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Like the comb keeps him bobbing.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
It was just like, come, come...

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Yeah, he makes you come that fast,

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
like that consistently, so...

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Steve, do you feel guilty about cheating on Dan?

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Well, no, he's cheating on me.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
He's in a yogurt shop with this chick.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Dan, I think you're a little rude

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
to me in front of the yogurt lady.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I didn't... I didn't like that.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
I...

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Well, I...

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Why are you trying to make me apologize?

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I'm not trying to make you apologize.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
So let's go five minutes.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Okay.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
So now I'm like, like, fuck you.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Yeah, hysterical.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Get a job.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
You...

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
You...

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
You're three episodes behind on community

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
and it pays your rent.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Fuck you.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
You should feel bad about things.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Not just me.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Get even angrier.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Like, you don't have to...

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Well, are we...

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
At this point, it's usually when we've split up

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
and I'm just texting you horrible Kevin Spacey,

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
like, fucking, like...

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Fuck off, fuck you.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Okay.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
So my reaction, my planned reaction

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
is what I'm gonna do, like, if you're looking in my face,

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
just say I hate you in a very angry...

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Like, yell at me and say I hate you.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Okay, my line is, I hate you.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I hate you.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Uh, hey, man.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
You wanna get high?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Uh, uh...

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
It's TVG.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Yeah.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Um...

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Hey, I was just, uh...

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I was just at...

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
I was just at Sarah's and, uh...

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
All right, man.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Uh, can I...

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Can I just sit here and play on my phone?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Yeah, man, you're a guy that gets me high. It's fine.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
All right, cool.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
All right.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
So I'll do that.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I will try that. I'll do a...

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Hey, man.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Well, yeah, I mean,

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I remember when you first met my parents

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
and we were like...

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
It was so weird because

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I kept getting upset because

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
of your parents, like, there's no way

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
you can ever become, like...

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
You always, like, prep yourself.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
You're like, okay, now I'm 58.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
My parents are almost dead.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
I'm definitely...

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
I'm done with this.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I'm not gonna start acting like a child.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
And then we started playing catchphrase with my parents

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
and I was on my mom's team and she was like,

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I don't know, Tweety Bird?

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And I'm like, the buzzer went off and I went,

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Yeeeeww, cunt!

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Uh, where did that come from?

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Where did that come from?

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
But it was...

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I called my mom the C word.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Holy shit.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Because she couldn't guess what Tweety Bird was

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
or something.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
But it was because within three minutes

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
of her arriving, like,

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
in front of Erin, like, my mom has this weird,

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
like, capacity for...

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
She doesn't understand what she's doing.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
She could figure out how to call you fat,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
like, without...

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
She's like Houdini of calling you fat.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
And then she...

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
It was in my boot.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
There's no way she...

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
She has to call me fat somehow.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
She always figures it out within three minutes.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Like, let me know how much weight I've gained.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
And I was just like, it's unbelievable.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And then I swallow that down and then I'm like...

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
I mean, they say to not date a man

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
who has issues with his mother.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
But the gag became like...

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
You can double down.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
So I was getting jostled.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
And then we were...

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
We were not married yet.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
We were very...

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
We were fresh.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I was going to say very much in love.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
And then I was like, okay.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
And so we would...

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Before I really got things changed with Steve.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I was getting riled up.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
But then I would get riled up

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
and I would start to spill over into Erin

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
and then you...

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
You were like, hey,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I love you.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
And then I would go, I love you.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
But it was sort of like a joke.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
It was kind of ironic.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
And then my dad started doing the joke

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
of everyone was just saying I love you

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
and that became the running joke.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Any time someone started to get upset,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
everyone would just say I love you.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
So it was a joke.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000
But that we all operated as a healthy family for...

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
It was like a bit.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Let's do that bit

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
where we stop getting angry

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
and say I love you.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
That's how we needed to parse it.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Was this before you called your mom a cunt or after?

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
No, I mean, it was during.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
It was during.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Ordinarily...

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
I think what happened is I called my mom a cunt

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
and then I said, I love you.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
I've never told you this

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
and I had forgotten about it.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
But I was going through my old iPad pictures

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
and I had my iPad with me

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
that night and I have a picture

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
that's a selfie.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I'm assuming I'm not the only one

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
who takes pictures of themselves in moments

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
that are like, remember that moment

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
when you were here in this place

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
and there's a picture of me

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
wide-eyed.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
I'll post it somewhere with Dan

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
and his parents in the background

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
and I'm just like...

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
This is where you are.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
This is this moment.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Either in three years you'll be married

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
or you'll be telling stories about this

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
insane night.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I did not know that you were going through that.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I thought you were

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
like this earth goddess

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
that was like, your tendrils were just

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
affecting us and that we were psycho

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
and it wasn't affecting you.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Oh no, I was like...

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Please don't take back

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
calling me an earth goddess.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
I'll kill myself.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I am an earth goddess.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
I wasn't having a bad time

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
but there was obviously so much tension

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
and Dan's mom

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
was calling him fat

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
and it was very strange

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
and Dan's dad was on my team

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
and would kiss me after every round

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
and I'm like, what is...

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
But not in that way.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
But in a like, hey, I don't know,

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
he's kind of a...

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Hey!

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
You know...

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Just fist.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
No, I don't...

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
No, I wasn't even making a hitting joke.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I was imagining someone's...

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
licking someone's fist for some reason.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Just like a...

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Why am I sharing these thoughts?

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Just...

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Just a kiss.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Just a light kiss on the lips.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
But it was a different memory I have.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I was like...

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
But that's not entirely fair to my dad

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
because there was a point where it was like...

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Because you two were such assholes together

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
because you were winning

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
and you're both incredibly competitive.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
I learned how to play poker for my dad

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
and I learned how to cheat

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
from my dad because he would cheat

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
and the only way I learned how to cheat

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
was by catching him cheating.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
My dad would play poker with children and cheat.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Like...

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
He would like stand up and I'd be like...

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Ace of Hearts under your ass!

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
You fucking dick!

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
He would take IOUs from us

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
and I would like mow the lawn.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I'd be like, here's your five dollars.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Like fucking my dad, yeah.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
But like, you know...

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
He was a good sport.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
And I cheated.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
And obviously I'm like...

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
But you and him

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
way more similar than you should...

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Like comfortable.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
And you were winning a catchphrase.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
So the two of you erupted

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
in an amorous fit.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
So there was a round where my mom couldn't get

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Tweety Bird and I'm like, you cunt!

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
And the next round is like...

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
My dad was like, it's like a guy

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
in a fever, you're like John Travolta

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
and you're both like, yay! And you made out!

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
And it was your

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
choice.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Because you were very excited.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Why did you not initiate?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I remember, it's not re-write history.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
You fucking made out with my dad.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
And it's because

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
you guys are the same person

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
and...

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
You're so competitive.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
just wanted to see what it would be like.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Obviously

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
it turned me on, obviously.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Why wouldn't I...

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Why would I remember it if it didn't?

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I'm gonna go...

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Let's cut the show early. I'm gonna go jerk off to

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Aaron

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
making out with my dad during catchphrase.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
No.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
So

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
we started a little late

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
but I imagine there's another show after this

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
so we can't go over.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
There's an...

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
It's not up to you.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
There's someone in the back going

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
do these people know what they're doing?

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
I'm sure there's some guy coming in

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
that's gonna sweat it if we fuck up.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
So we should definitely try

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
to...

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
I'm sure these people probably want to see us

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
do a proper

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Shadowrun time, you guys.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Why not?

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I'm enjoying Shadowrun as a game.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I like the Shadowrun world.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
It seems like...

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
It's just a good time.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Just a good time.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I felt a little

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
forward during our Bigfoot campaign

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
when I tried to talk to Chipmunks.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I came down on you too hard.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
It was because my ambition.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
My ambition is the enemy of my friendships.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I should be more intimate and in the moment with you guys.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I should not plan ahead.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I'm a megalomaniac.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
I try to control things.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
It's interesting.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
You were trying to meet Sasquatch by shooting him away

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
and trying to beat Spencer to the contrarian punch

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
and I was trying to meet...

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
The best way I knew how to meet a mythological beast

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
was by being in the mythological universe.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Yeah.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
That's deep.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
I don't believe that.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
I feel like you just wanted to have an emerald dagger.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
A low light vision.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I don't think you thought that was going to attract Bigfoot.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
No, I thought that would be the fastest way

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
to use low light vision and an emerald dagger

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
to communicate with Chipmunks.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Yeah. If you knew how dumb that sound.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
But you know

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Chipmunks aren't going to help you.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
That was just you.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
I wanted to communicate with the forest

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
and link into the world.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Jeff, be Steve.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Be Steve.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Be Steve?

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Yeah, just try it.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
No, she's saying,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
say hey man and offer to be high

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
because now I'm turning into an asshole.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
All right.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Dan, do you want to pass down the character sheet

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
so we can kick this motherfucker off?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
All right.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
No, I wasn't really mad.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I didn't want to have a moment backstage.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Wait, what?

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
We were both trying to help in different ways

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
and it was cross purposes.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Yeah, so who is Steve playing?

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Will he be Dr. Friend?

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I think I gave him Dr. Friend.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I walked by those same two

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
homeless guys earlier today

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
and they called me beautiful.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Yeah.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Were those the guys who liked my coat?

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Yeah, they called me.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Speaking to the vanity thing, they called me beautiful

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
and I was like, oh, thank you.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And then I passed by them another time

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
and I...

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
And I may have even brushed my hair

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
before I turned the corner.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Oh, Portland.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
I'm enjoying your puritanical outfit, Aaron.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I like that look on you.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Thank you.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
What is sexy about that?

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Because I saw you like very beautiful

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
and I don't know what it is

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
because it's like not typically like, I don't know.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I like the clean lines.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Thank you.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Thank you.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
You like the clean line?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Simple?

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Yeah, the unbridled kind of

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
stability.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Unbridled stability.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
This is your new perfume, right?

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Yeah.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
That would be the worst title

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
to our podcast of all time.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
She takes no chances.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
She's reliable.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
We're unbridled, meets sensitivity.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
She doesn't go out because it's unsafe.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
She believes in witches.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
She might be one. She might not.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
All right, Spencer, shall we let's?

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Shall we let's?

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Do we have a guest backup artist?

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Yeah,

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Theo from Finland.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Theo from Finland?

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Wait, is that a character?

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
It's the new character Dan's playing.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
No, it's...

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
He wrote the recap.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
We invite people to write our recaps

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
if you ever want to write what Spencer does

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
and recaps our last venture.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I was asking if we needed somebody...

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
I'm wasting our last 10 minutes.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
I was asking if we needed anybody to play.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Anybody.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Are we missing a character, Spencer?

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I mean, yeah, but it's fine.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Let's just do it.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
We have a gang of friends upstairs.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
We can bring somebody else down if you want.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
We got... Yep.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Is Jonah right here?

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Jonah, you want to come down?

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Jonah Ray, everybody!

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Oh, no, oh, no.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
This guy.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Freestyle Jonah, freestyle.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Pattern shirts.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Man, that song just got me so fucking pumped.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
It did, it did feel like, it was like,

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
let's do a different kind of show.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Maybe we should have come out to that.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Alright, play it again, play it again.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Let's fucking fire this up.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
From the top, from the top.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Just for a second, just for one, two, three.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Yo.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Yo.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Do you have nightblade rap?

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Do you have nightblade?

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Yo.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Yo.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Fuck it.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Fuck.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Yo.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Pour it land.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
On the ocean.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Yo.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I'm back to eat seafood.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000
I got, I got your mama and I'm in the mood.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I'm gonna go to the northwest and cut down some wood.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
I'm gonna find big food.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
I'm gonna camp with your mama.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Gonna, gonna fuck her and ride away on a llama.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Dumb, dumb rhyme.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Yo.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Yo, it's Portland time.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000
I wanna have a massage and fly a kite.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I'm gonna walk my dog but walk the fucker right.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:53.000
It's a pretty flat place with a lot of stuff for your dog.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Space, with floor space.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Yo.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Yo.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Go to Doodle.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Yo.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Go to Doodle.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Spring, spring, spring.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Springer spaniel.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Yo.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
I got a big dog.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
A working green and I saw logs.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.000
My dog's real smart but he doesn't think that I don't have a heart

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000
because he's got lots of land to walk in

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
and I'm in Portland.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Have a donut.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Nice.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Don't, don't patronize me.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Nice.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
I appreciate, I understand.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
You, you paid $100.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I understand you need to think that was entertaining.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
I don't want to deflect a compliment.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
People stood in line for three hours for that round.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
But don't debase yourself.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
You have Stockholm syndrome.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
It was a bad rap.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000
You admire a bad person.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Everything you think is entertaining is bad.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Have a good week.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
And he disappears.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Hey Jonah.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Hi Jonah, how's it going?

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
I'm glad I inspired freestyle rap.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
It happens to me all the time.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Which character is Jonah gonna play for Spencer?

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
I got, I got, what's his name?

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Hordegaard.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.000
We were joking at breakfast.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Jonah Ray, his last name is Ray.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.000
So we were talking about the, what you call your fans.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Like the people that like bones,

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Hart Hansen calls them boneheads.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
And that Jonah Ray jokingly at one point

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
addressed his fans as Ray Pists.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000
That was a real bad idea.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Every once in a while a guy still comes up to him

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
in like a fabric store and is like,

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000
hey man, I've been a rapist for five years.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Really like your...

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
No, no, no, no, not here.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Not at the fabric store, which I commonly frequent.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Anywhere but here.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
I was a rapist before I met my wife.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Then I turned her on to it.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
No, she's a rapist too.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
The only other option is Jonah Ray'sist.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
And I don't know if that's even any better.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
I'm a Jonah Ray'sist.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Oh, no.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
All right, so you know the rules.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
You have a sheet of paper full of arithmetic

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
that you're too drunk to read.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
And Spencer is a beleaguered genius

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
that suffers through...

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Hey, that's very kind.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
It's not a joke.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
I appreciate it.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I love you.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I love you.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
I love you too.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
He says staring into the bottle...

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I can't look at you, but I love you.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Look him in the eye and say it, Dan.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Make eye contact with Spencer.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Make eye contact with Steve and say it.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
That I love you?

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Yeah.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Steve...

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
What?

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I love Spencer.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
What the fuck?

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
He wasn't even...

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
It was just the abuse of Steve.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
All right.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Spencer, I got you high.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
This is...

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
This is what weed brings.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
All right, Spencer, you ready to rock?

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Here we go.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
A little shadow run.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Yo.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Yeah.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Shadow run.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Circuitry.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Neuromancer.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Inspired by William Gibson.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Fuck your mom so hard.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
She had some lips and...

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Shit.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Okay.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Last time on Shadow Run.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.000
The gang was back at the bar where they found a mysterious magenta clad man...

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Magenta clad man with a bow and arrow.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Meanwhile, Jim sat in the car guarding the restrained Arturo,

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
not convinced with his reassurances.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Nightblade went John Travolta in the back seat

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
and blew the helpless gangster's brains out

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000
before throwing the stiff in the nearest dumpster.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000
The gang's fist fixer, Teddy, revealed

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
he hired a brooding bowman, Hacker, called Hackeye,

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000
who was around to help with scrubbing surveillance data

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
and destroying digital evidence.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
And the gang found themselves a new gig,

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
acquiring Baldwin Brown's research from a brain clinic

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.000
secured with vibration sensors, cameras, and guards.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000
The runners agreed to jump in Hackeye, whatever that meant,

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.000
but would his prowess help them pull off their first clean Shadow Run?

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Would he be able to keep deflecting Mercy's moves

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
or would he get his boffin's balls kissed?

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Find out. Harmon Time.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Thank you.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Thanks again to Tio from Finland.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Thank you.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000
So, you guys, you're at Hank's Last Stand.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
It's a rusty old bar. You're in the middle.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.000
You've got Hackeye, the magenta-clad stranger

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
with a bow and arrow, sitting, drinking a water,

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000
and you guys just got your mission from Mr. Johnson.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
The mission again is to do what, sorry?

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
You've got to retrieve research files

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000
that belong to Baldwin Brown from the confines

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000
of Mind Plus Limited, the brain clinic.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Can you refresh me on what we had done to Baldwin Brown?

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Did we just hand him over?

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
You hand him over to a company. You sold him to a company.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
So, there's files belonging to him that we want.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
These files are in Mind Plus Limited.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
They're his research.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
And they kind of scolded us on our last...

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Not them. That was Teddy.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I just care about you guys.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Yeah, we're kind of like bad Shadow Runners.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000
We were just told, good job, you finished,

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000
but your score is low.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I pulled the whole team aside except for Hackeye,

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
whom we've just met, and we're told it will be helpful.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
And we said, when we talked about jumping this guy in,

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
how do we know we can trust this guy?

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
There must be some sort of procedure.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
But he was recommended by cool Ted?

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Teddy. Right?

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000
I mean, we can do what we did when we first met,

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
when we were testing each other.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Give an old Tennessee Reach Around.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Tennessee Reach Around, yeah.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Tennessee Reach Around.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Yeah, let's take him out back.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Let's all give him a Tennessee Reach Around.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Yes, yeah.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
We all wink at each other knowingly.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Yeah.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Who's playing?

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Are we about to rape somebody?

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I don't understand what the fuck is that.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
What the fuck is a Tennessee Reach Around?

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Is someone playing this character?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
I love Jonah Ray.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
It's got him pretty edgy.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
As I remember the Tennessee Reach Around,

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000
what it is is we say we're going to trust each other,

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:57.000
and the hardest thing to do ever is to have someone behind you.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Right.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.000
How can everybody in a group always have someone watching their back?

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000
The answer is the Tennessee Reach Around.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000
We hold a weapon in our right hand,

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000
and we make them expose some skin on their stomach,

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000
and we say, I'm not going to hurt you there.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
You have to stand still, and if they stand still for a minute

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
and believe you, then they get that weapon.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000
And they get to join the team.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.000
And that's the Tennessee Reach Around.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
There's no reaching around.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Or Tennessee.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
It started in Tennessee.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000
I thought...

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Yes, and.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I caught myself.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Were you about to tell everyone to get out of their get?

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
No, I was going to pitch a different thing.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
If you remember it differently, it's been so long.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000
I thought it was when we all got in a kind of leapfrog type line

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.000
where everyone gets to experience someone whispering in their ear,

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000
you got your back, bro. And then you go around

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
so that everyone knows that everyone's got their back.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
You can just stand in a circle.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
And say, I got your back.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Everyone's behind everyone else's back.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Oh, yeah. God damn it.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Wait, who are you?

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Hordergaard. My name's Hordergaard.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Oh, okay. Yeah, he's the smart one.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Yeah, let's do it in a circle.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
We all go out in the parking lot in the back,

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
and we get in a circle, and on the count of three,

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
we're all going to say, I got your back.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Okay.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
One, two, two.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
So what do we say on three, or one, two, three, go.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
We'll say it on the four.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Whatever we're four.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Can I just ask before we do this,

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
should we jerk each other off?

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Well, no. That's only if we end to see reach around.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
A lot of people ask that.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Shouldn't we have a secret?

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
No, this isn't...

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I say, can I make a pitch?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Yeah.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
One, two, three, we all whisper gently,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
I got your back, and then if you want to start jerking somebody off,

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
you can, but you only got eight seconds.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
That's called a Tennessee reach around

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
with a Seattle finish.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
I don't know.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
I thought maybe they hated Seattle.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
I took a chance.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Who's standing behind who?

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Huh? Who's standing behind who?

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I'm standing behind Hordergaard for sure.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
All right.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
So one, two, three, I got your back.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
If you want to jerk somebody off, eight seconds,

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
I think we're done.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
But you can't make them.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Right. Otherwise, we...

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
They have to be exposed.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
So if you want to expose yourself in that moment

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
and put your hand around...

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
I guess the cleanest way to do this

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
is for us to all take our pants down

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
before we start this.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Dick's out.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Dick's out?

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I'm a woman, so...

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Yeah, we're both women.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
I'm going to say, you know,

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
it's a lot more invasive to be entered

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
as opposed to just like tug, so maybe just like a pat.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Entered.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Also, I'm a dwarf,

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
so are you going to be able to reach down

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
and around?

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Most certainly.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Okay, good.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
How can the person in front of you let you know

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
that they're open to this if we're all dropping our pants?

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Every...

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Everyone that's available for this

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
do pigtails.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
When we count to three, you pull up your pants

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
if you don't want it.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
On the count of three?

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I have to urinate really bad,

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
so nothing might come out.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
What if you pee instead of cum?

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Exactly.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
On the count of three, everybody close your eyes.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
If you want to take your pants down,

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
you take your pants down.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Then we open our eyes, you look at the person in front of you,

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
if their pants are down, that means they're open

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
to reach around with Seattle Finish.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Then we count to three again,

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
and then we say, I got you back,

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
and then if you want to jerk somebody off,

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
eight seconds.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Why don't we all just fuck?

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
It's clearly what we're trying to get at,

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
and we're not doing it.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
We're just playing these games.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Also, don't we already know each other?

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
We're jumping a stranger in,

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
but we're like really...

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
We don't believe in hazing.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
We're a new group

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
and we're a techno man, so we've just met at the bar.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
We don't know this guy.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
So he's a robot?

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
He's part machine, part man, right?

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
So he's the one that we can't even jerk off?

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
No, no.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Maybe he's a jerk-off machine.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
I will tell you that

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
in a Tennessee reach around,

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
there is a phrase we use for the guy

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
that doesn't drop his own pants

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
and then is willing to jerk off

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
the person in front of him.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
What's that phrase?

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Republican!

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I know, exactly.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
They're not conservative.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
They just hate hat comedy.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Let's do it.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Wait, so hold on.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
We count to three.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Close your eyes.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Take your pants off or not.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Then we count to three again.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Open your eyes, look at the person in front of you.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
If the pants are down, that means they're willing

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
to get the Seattle finish

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
from the Tennessee reach around.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
How are we going to show?

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
If your pants are down,

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
you raise your hand.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
You don't have to raise your hand.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
I'm saying to represent it on stage,

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
we should raise our hand.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
So we close our eyes.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Who's that?

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Is Hakai even with you?

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Is Hakai even with you?

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Hakai is like the audience right now

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
and is just like, what?

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Can we have somebody else?

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
No, he didn't get invited out back with you guys.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Oh shit, he's still at the bar.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
That's good though.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
We should go get him now that we know what we're doing.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Should we have Craig come back up?

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Craig, are you here?

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Can we all just practice our Tennessee reach arounds?

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Yeah, we should practice.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
We should do a practice round.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Close your eyes.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
One, two, three.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
And I'm inside.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Come on, Aaron.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
I'm inside.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Well, this is going to work out easy.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Good job, guys.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I'm grabbing him.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
You got Hakai?

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Hakai, can we talk to you outside?

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Yeah.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
All right, this way.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Just be open-minded.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Okay.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Oh, hey man.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Hey.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Hakai,

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I haven't explained to him

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
what's going down,

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
but we're going to do

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
our rituals.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I feel like it's pretty self-explanatory,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
but laying out for it.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Spencer at the bar,

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
at one point was like,

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
I forgot my shadow run notes.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Don't worry about it.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
I think we're going to be fine.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
What if we saw

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
he got his notes and we looked at it

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
and it was like

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
needlessly arguing about

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
jerking each other off.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Like three seconds,

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
then raise your hand.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
You know what?

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Let's stand in the circle.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Part of this is just trusting each other.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
I'm going to explain this,

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
and we're going to go one, two, three,

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
and we're going to do it.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
You were here when we decided

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
who was going to take our pants off.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Oh, yeah.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
But we should count as being given the opportunity, right?

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
So at the count of three,

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
if you want to get jerked off,

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
or

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
if you want to be in this brotherhood,

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
or what is this?

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
We're the toughest gang in town.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
It honestly is if you want to get jerked off,

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
because it doesn't preclude...

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Also, are you guys hard?

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
How is this working?

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
That's none of your business.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
I'm a woman.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Right.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
So it is...

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
This is one of the moments when I imagine

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
a floating mom head

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
with her eyes just...

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
You could have been a lawyer.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
And a floating hand

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
coming up above the head.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
There are gangs who beat the crap out of their new people,

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
which is a dumb move

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
in terms of Darwinism.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
It's like, oh, this new guy,

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
let's make him physically injured.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
This is what we do.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
It's about choice.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
There's no wrong answer, or so you don't know.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Let's get in the circle.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
All right, let's do it.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Get in the circle.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Nice.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
One.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
I got your back, bro.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
I got your back.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I got your back.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
He's in.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Who's behind him?

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I don't know.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Hack guy likes it.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
You're behind him, right?

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I'm behind you, hack guy.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
That's why he dropped his pants.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
He's in front of a 19-year-old...

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
It doesn't matter.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
This is successful.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
We did it.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
We all just agreed to a

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
track off orgy.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
It's a circle, sir.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
We all agreed, right?

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
We already did it.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Now we have to do it.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Why are we closing our eyes?

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Just do it.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
One, two, three.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Yay!

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Cliffhanger!

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I got your back.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
I got your back.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I got your back.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I got your back.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Steve A.G.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Jonah Ray.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Craig the Sasquatch Hunter.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I'm Jeff Davis, your mayor.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Dan Harmon, thank you so much.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Yeah.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Can I give a special shout-out

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
to Aaron's first

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
improv art director, Trenton Shine?

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Okay.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
I think she did really good

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
improv tonight.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
I would say that was some of the

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
finest shadow-running we've ever done.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Yeah, we love you partly.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
We love you so much. Thanks for

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
having us. Thanks for coming here.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Did you get any of that?

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:43.000
It's a good show.
