What do they eat like herbivores? They eat like nuts and berries?\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:45.000\nThey don't give a fuck about nuts and berries.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nThat's a real line from the movie.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nThe word fuck is in that movie more than anything.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nMore than a Scorsese film.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:58.000\nEveryone's saying fuck in ways that you never even heard the word fuck used.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:02.000\nThey're just past the fuck salt.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nThere is no fucking salt.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:10.000\nWe're in a frozen sea surrounded by killers.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:13.000\nThey've got a kill range of 300 kilometers.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:17.000\nIf we're in within half of that and they've got cubs, we're already dead.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nHow did...\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:23.000\nI have questions about that.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nI want...\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:28.000\nWell, I don't want to see the movie.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:31.000\nThe movie doesn't matter.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:35.000\nDo you think these things give a fuck what you watch on a screen?\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:39.000\nThey just want to eat your face.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:44.000\nThey can see you 300% further than you can see them.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:49.000\nTheir eyes are like microscopes and telescopes taped to each other.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nTheir noses are sharper than their teeth.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nTheir noses are sharper than their teeth?\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:57.000\nYes.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:00.000\nWho would win in a fight, a bear or a wolf?\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nThey fight. They hunt.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nSorry, what was the rest of the question?\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:11.000\nI got distracted by something I could dismiss.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nI think wolf versus bear.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:16.000\nThey're not wolves. Oh, I'm sorry, they are.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:19.000\nSorry, I got a jump the gun.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nOur guns don't matter.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nBut I jumped them.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:26.000\nI can't verify it because I don't think I've seen enough of this film\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nto know if you're doing a good Liam Neeson impression right now.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\nThis is pretty good.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:33.000\nIs it good?\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:38.000\nIt's pretty early in the night for the audience to be sarcastic.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:43.000\nThose of you who were here last week, I bet none of you were here last week\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:48.000\nbecause I went headlong for Inception's throat.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nLike an angry wolf.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:57.000\nAnd you could feel the rift between me and the flock.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:01.000\nBo Peep almost got sheaped to death.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.000\nI was listening to the podcast version of it.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:09.000\nI didn't sense that the audience was disgruntled by your hatred.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nIt's their faces. You see their faces.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:15.000\nJust watch you at home that are listening on the podcast.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nYou won't be able to participate in this.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nJeff, you focus on them.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nI don't know. Inception?\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nIt's kind of dumb.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:27.000\nLook at that guy.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nHe looks horrified.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:34.000\nBut Harmontown is a plan that we have to form a colony.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:37.000\nWe don't want to be dire about this.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:41.000\nWe don't feel like the world is ending terribly soon.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nIt's not a huge emergency.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:50.000\nBut it takes a long time to start a city of people who can carry humanity's torch.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:54.000\nSo what we want to try to do, probably on the moon,\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:57.000\nI keep thinking it's got to be on the moon because I just don't know\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:00.000\nthere's no place in Texas that's going to let us do this.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nAnd I don't want to go anywhere where there's mosquitoes.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:07.000\nThey tried that once and the ATF came down pretty hard.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nYeah, don't groan it.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nI mean, groan the government.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nIt's bad form to burn people alive.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:17.000\nIt's a terrible, terrible way to govern.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nI feel like it is too, actually.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nWe have to talk about religion. We have to talk about politics.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:25.000\nWe have to talk about what we would do with our unseemly citizenry.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nWhat do you do if somebody does something you don't like?\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:31.000\nIt's going to happen in a room full of 200 people.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nYou, sir, do something that nobody likes.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nFuck Batman.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:39.000\nHe said fuck Batman.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:40.000\nI like that.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:41.000\nNow what do we do?\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nNow what do we do with him?\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nWe fuck him.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nAn eye for an eye.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nFuck him?\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nYeah, you fuck Batman. We fuck you.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:54.000\nIt's not that hard, governments.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nWe figured it out. That's it.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nNow what do we do? Let's play charades.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:02.000\nAlso, a lot of my answers are, I'm just going to fuck you.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nThank you for doing that. That's not easy to be called upon.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nI'm like a drowning man in a pool. You don't have to applaud him. That's ridiculous.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:13.000\nYou can if you want to, but don't ever do anything here that you feel compelled to do.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.000\nThat's bad governing.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nDid you not like the new Batman?\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:19.000\nI haven't seen it either. I've given up on movies.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nI don't even want to go to them anymore.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nYou didn't like the new Batman. I haven't heard anything good about it.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:25.000\nIt was silly.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nSilly.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:29.000\nIt's silly, he says.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nWe should give this guy an identity. What's your name?\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:32.000\nMax.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nMax.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:34.000\nShe can have a microphone for fuck's sake.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nWell, you can have one if you want.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:40.000\nWell, here's a Batman we can talk about because a lot of you people didn't even see it\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nand the ones who did probably blocked it out.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:46.000\nThe Tommy Lee Jones Two-Face.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.000\nI was explaining this to my 27-year-old girlfriend today.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:53.000\nIt was like explaining Korea or something.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.000\nShe was going, what? Come on.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nBatman was sitting in the courtroom?\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nWait, is this hanging out?\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nShe started laughing.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nWe were actually watching the second Batman.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:04.000\nEverybody agrees.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:09.000\nIt's a pretty, well, it's certainly the best Batman movie we've ever seen.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:13.000\nDo you think it's like Korea in that north and south that it's divided like Two-Face?\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nNo.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:20.000\nDown the middle of his face, there's the 30th parallel of...\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:21.000\nNo, I apologize.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nI'm all over the place tonight.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:26.000\nI meant like I'm like an old veteran and I'm going, well, she's going, what were you\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:27.000\nfinding about Grandpa?\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:30.000\nI'm like, well, we wanted the Korea to be different.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nWell, who gives a shit about Korea now?\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nI don't know.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:37.000\nWe gave a shit back then.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:45.000\nWhat if the character of Two-Face was actually a trenchant commentary on the Korean conflict?\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nI don't remember which movie it was.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nIt was either...\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nI think it was the Danny DeVito as the Penguin one.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:55.000\nI think it was still Michael Cheaton was Batman sitting in the courtroom in his Batman outfit.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:59.000\nAnd they show the origin of Two-Face in the form of a newsreel.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:03.000\nAnd Tommy Lee Jones is questioning a mob guy.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nAnd the mob guy doesn't like the way it's going.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:13.000\nSo he pulls out, as they do, a jar of acid from his, you know, the pocket of his double-breasted\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nsuit coat, your jar of pocket.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:21.000\nAnd he flings it at Tommy Lee Jones, who, it's a visual thing.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:25.000\nI'll do what he did visually first.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:31.000\nHe uses a manila folder to block exactly half his face.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nAnd that's how he became Two-Face.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:40.000\nAnd he has a contentious relationship with Batman as Aaron Eckhart's Two-Face does with\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nChristian Bale's Batman.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:46.000\nIn this version, just because, well, where were you when I got that acid on half of my face?\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:51.000\nAnd the answer is, I was sitting there in the courtroom and I just couldn't get over the gallery thing.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:58.000\nLike, they show a shot of Batman trying to get over the courtroom, like, little people's court flappy door.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nIt couldn't be more ridiculous.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:06.000\nYou have to show Batman, like, taking a shit to ruin the mythology more for nerds.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:13.000\nLike, we just sat there in the theater and looked at Schrab and Schrab looked at me and we just, we started making out.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nI understand the appeal of Batman.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:22.000\nSomewhere in our heart, we want a guy out there that's, like, rich, which represents the fact that America, it does work.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nIt's okay to be capitalist.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:32.000\nBut, you know, we need a hero, we need a Prometheus who uses his godlike powers to, you know, uphold our value system.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nBut, Max, you said the new one is silly.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:35.000\nYes, it's a little silly.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nThey're not taking it seriously enough.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nWell, maybe a little too serious.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nOh, okay, okay.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:46.000\nYou know what Liam Neeson would say about Batman?\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nDoesn't matter.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.000\nI'm determined that Liam Neeson pays off at some point tonight.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:53.000\nHe probably will.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nThere's no payoff.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:58.000\nYou're not going to get paid, you're going to get eaten.\n\n11:58.000 --> 11:59.000\nIt's a weird crowd tonight.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nI'm going to blame them.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nI blame them.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nI don't know what they did wrong.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nI don't know what you guys did.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nI kind of blame myself.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:10.000\nI feel like I blew it by leaving town for one week and the continuity's just gone to shit.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:11.000\nThey're expecting that.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:16.000\nThey're like, where's this show that I got all excited about where the couple bitches at each other?\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nAnd then they bring other couples up and ruin.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nCan I, I was out of town.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:24.000\nI hang out with Aaron and Dan quite a bit.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:30.000\nAnd I see them, they have the little moments of cuddling and schmoopy schmoops.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:34.000\nAnd then they frequently have their moments when you're at the great Greek having Greek food\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:38.000\nand they're fighting about the new improv idea that we have for 40 minutes.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:43.000\nAnd it's an impenetrable, lonely place to be sitting across the table from them.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:47.000\nAnd then I justifying exit and I have a loser with a guy named Nikos.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:51.000\nAnd I come back and they're still talking about the improv group.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nAnd then one of them goes to the bathroom and I depose that person and say,\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:58.000\nis this better or worse than being alone?\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nAnd then they pause for eight and a half seconds.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:05.000\nAnd in that pause, I leave and have another Uzo with Nikos.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:06.000\nAnd I come back and there's no answer.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:09.000\nAnd then they come back and you guys are making out and you guys look so happy together.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:13.000\nAnd then you probably go home and have the worst sex of your lives.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:18.000\nYeah, I have no qualification for that.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:21.000\nThat's true.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:27.000\nSo after that podcast, because there was a moment, you guys were very self-revolatory.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nAnd then what happened after that podcast?\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:34.000\nYou guys go home and you got to go to Baskin Robbins on Sunday and you go home and...\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:38.000\nYeah, that's just, it wasn't really revelatory.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nI'm dating me now.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:44.000\nI'm dating myself with red hair.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:47.000\nI'm dating another person that's like me.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nWe don't balance each other out.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:54.000\nWe just sink every boat that we step onto.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:58.000\nBecause we just go straight to the asshole section, which is...\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nThere's only one seat there.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nWe sit on each other.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:05.000\nWe argue about it as we sink.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:08.000\nWe don't call the stern of the boat the asshole section.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nBut you know, who wants to die alone?\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nThat sounds, you know...\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nMe!\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:19.000\nI see it at the finish line.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.000\nI don't know.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nWhen I'm alone, I'm not alive.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.000\nI don't know that I exist when I'm alone.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:32.000\nI feel like there's a swarm of black CGI insects eating my fucking skeleton from under my skin.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nI feel like something wrong is happening.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nThat's when I'm feeling anything.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nI just don't feel like I exist.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nI'm a mouth with a brain on it.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:48.000\nAnd two little legs to walk it around and make people listen to my bullshit.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:53.000\nIf I'm just walking around an empty house, I can't talk to anybody.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nI'm not alive.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nYou don't talk to yourself when you're at home?\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nI haven't had enough experience with it.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nBut no, I don't.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:07.000\nI'll maybe mutter something.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nMy bathtub's not working.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:13.000\nHow am I gonna make the jets shoot up my ass?\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:14.000\nI don't know.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:18.000\nWhere did I put that mannequin leg?\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nCan't find it.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nFrickin' Frickin' Frickin' Frickin' Frickin' Frickin'

15:30.000\nI don't get it either, but I know, I know what I like.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.720\nLike a good woman to hate me.\n\n15:34.720 --> 15:36.240\nNo, we love each other.\n\n15:36.240 --> 15:37.720\nNow we're gonna get a big fight about,\n\n15:37.720 --> 15:39.560\nErin takes everything I say,\n\n15:39.560 --> 15:41.240\nnot everything I say very seriously.\n\n15:41.240 --> 15:43.440\nErin and I get in fights sometimes about,\n\n15:48.440 --> 15:50.040\nFor those of you listening in podcast lens,\n\n15:50.040 --> 15:52.480\nshe's in row two, seat F.\n\n15:53.440 -->

out,\n\n15:58.800 --> 15:59.640\nwhat I do in the show is,\n\n15:59.640 --> 16:02.520\nI stand up here for an hour and waste everyone's time.\n\n16:02.520 --> 16:04.000\nWhile I'm doing

--> 21:54.060\nbecause it's one sixth the gravity.\n\n21:54.980 --> 21:57.620\nJesus, we were both trying not to win kind of.\n\n21:57.620 --> 21:59.860\nAnd who do you think actually had, to be honest?\n\n21:59.860 --> 22:00.700\nWho, who what?\n\n22:00.700 --> 22:01.740\nWho do you think actually would have taken\n\n22:01.740 --> 22:03.140\nthat one if it had been like anybody\n\n22:03.140 --> 22:06.180\nthat's ever arm wrestled me would win?\n\n22:06.180 --> 22:07.740\nI've never, I couldn't do a pullup\n\n22:07.740 --> 22:09.340\nin grade school.\n\n22:09.340 --> 22:10.180\nI was always like,\n\n22:10.180 --> 22:12.260\ndid everybody go to grade schools\n\n22:12.260 --> 22:13.460\nwhere they made you do pullups?\n\n22:13.460 --> 22:15.340\nLike the gym pass, like,\n\n22:15.340 --> 22:17.140\nit's my imagination,\n\n22:17.140 --> 22:18.420\nI don't want to insult you guys,\n\n22:18.420 --> 22:19.940\nbut I would like to think that everyone\n\n22:19.940 --> 22:21.700\nin a Harmontown town meeting\n\n22:21.700 --> 22:24.100\nis all of the people who couldn't do one pullup.\n\n22:25.700 --> 22:30.460\nAnd we want to prove that you don't need to.\n\n22:31.940 --> 22:34.380\nWhat it should say in Latin on the flag is\n\n22:34.380 --> 22:39.380\nour gym teacher was wrong, people die of heart attacks\n\n22:39.780 --> 22:41.540\nevery day, some of them were good at football,\n\n22:41.540 --> 22:42.380\nsome of them weren't.\n\n22:42.380 --> 22:44.260\nLike it has no bearing on lifespan,\n\n22:44.260 --> 22:47.740\nno tax bracket, it doesn't,\n\n22:47.740 --> 22:50.100\nit's just some shit that we were doing back then\n\n22:50.100 --> 22:52.380\nto just make everyone uncomfortable and kill time.\n\n22:52.380 --> 22:53.860\nI, I, they should have,\n\n22:53.860 --> 22:54.700\nthey should have,\n\n22:54.700 --> 22:57.580\nthey should have let us play Dungeons and Dragons more.\n\n22:57.580 --> 22:58.940\nI don't need to bait you guys,\n\n22:58.940 --> 23:03.420\nbut I'm a little winded by that experience.\n\n23:03.420 --> 23:07.220\nSomebody ask me the most embarrassing thing in the world.\n\n23:07.220 --> 23:09.140\nWhat's your favorite D&D character?\n\n23:09.140 --> 23:11.380\nWhat was my favorite, like the one that I played?\n\n23:11.380 --> 23:12.540\nWhat is your favorite,\n\n23:12.540 --> 23:15.060\nwhat is Dan, just to repeat in case we don't pick this up\n\n23:15.060 --> 23:18.380\nover podcast, what is Dan's favorite D&D character?\n\n23:18.380 --> 23:22.340\nI, my character that I played was named Jim Nightblade.\n\n23:22.340 --> 23:27.340\nAnd I was always partial to the throwing knife type,\n\n23:31.180 --> 23:33.300\nthe thief, the assassin.\n\n23:33.300 --> 23:35.740\nCould you describe to me your, your Dungeon Master?\n\n23:35.740 --> 23:36.580\nDid you have a good one?\n\n23:36.580 --> 23:39.900\nYes, Graham was the name of our Dungeon Master.\n\n23:39.900 --> 23:42.860\nHe's the greatest Dungeon Master that ever lived.\n\n23:42.860 --> 23:47.300\nHe, because he was just insanely like smart and, and like he,\n\n23:47.300 --> 23:50.780\nGraham, Graham had hair down to his shoulders.\n\n23:50.780 --> 23:53.220\nHe never washed it and this was before a Weezer.\n\n23:53.220 --> 23:54.220\nSo it mattered.\n\n23:54.220 --> 23:59.220\nThey had these big thick brown frame glasses and his,\n\n23:59.220 --> 24:02.180\nhe's, he only had like eight shirts and they were all from\n\n24:02.180 --> 24:03.500\ndifferent state parks.\n\n24:03.500 --> 24:06.340\nLike cause he was, it was obvious that like he had to kind of\n\n24:06.340 --> 24:08.820\nlike adventure nature fixation.\n\n24:08.820 --> 24:11.420\nI think it was like his dad, maybe just like flew the coop\n\n24:11.420 --> 24:14.100\nand like, he pictured him out there like climbing mountains\n\n24:14.100 --> 24:14.940\nand sandals or something.\n\n24:14.940 --> 24:18.140\nAnd he kind of like, he had this, he had all these t-shirts\n\n24:18.140 --> 24:19.860\nthat would have like a howling wolf on them.\n\n24:19.860 --> 24:22.620\nAnd I would say Montana or, or the,\n\n24:22.620 --> 24:24.700\nand then the next one would be, it would just say Alaska\n\n24:24.700 --> 24:26.220\nand there'd be two owls on a branch.\n\n24:26.220 --> 24:28.420\nThose were all his t-shirts, but they all had that.\n\n24:28.420 --> 24:32.100\nBut they all had permanent sweat stains in the armpits.\n\n24:32.100 --> 24:34.940\nAnd the, and the kids in school would just,\n\n24:34.940 --> 24:38.180\nthey would, their whole four year high school experience\n\n24:38.180 --> 24:41.420\nwas just the only thing that they got from Graham.\n\n24:41.420 --> 24:46.140\nI got worlds that he created with his mind and had a,\n\n24:46.140 --> 24:49.940\nhad a whole, a whole birth as a human being courtesy of Graham.\n\n24:49.940 --> 24:51.020\nFor the rest of the high school kids,\n\n24:51.020 --> 24:53.180\nthey were just, they just figured out 90 ways to trick\n\n24:53.180 --> 24:56.300\nsomeone into raising their arms so they could laugh at his,\n\n24:56.300 --> 24:58.540\nthey'd go, hey, what's, where are the lights?\n\n24:58.540 --> 24:59.740\nWhere are the lights?\n\n24:59.740 --> 25:01.340\nOh, they're up there.\n\n25:02.500 --> 25:03.900\nLook, there's a sweat stain in his armpit.\n\n25:03.900 --> 25:06.260\nYeah, God, when is that gonna get tired?\n\n25:06.260 --> 25:10.660\nBut he, he carried a woman's briefcase everywhere he went.\n\n25:10.660 --> 25:11.500\nBecause it didn't-\n\n25:11.500 --> 25:12.340\nB.J.\n\n25:12.340 --> 25:17.340\nHe, he fetishized Spock from old school Star Trek.\n\n25:17.940 --> 25:20.860\nLike he, he really, as a lot of like super nerds do,\n\n25:20.860 --> 25:24.620\nlike they latch onto Spock or data if they're younger,\n\n25:24.620 --> 25:26.420\nbecause it's like, it's logic.\n\n25:26.420 --> 25:28.340\nInstead of like all these trappings,\n\n25:28.340 --> 25:30.100\nlike all this shit that makes no sense.\n\n25:30.100 --> 25:32.260\nLike, can you dribble a basketball and what are you,\n\n25:32.260 --> 25:34.820\nwhy are you, no white pants after Labor Day or whatever,\n\n25:34.820 --> 25:37.060\nthe fuck, the stuff, there's nothing logical about it.\n\n25:37.060 --> 25:40.780\nSo you escape into this idea that you're just pure brain.\n\n25:40.780 --> 25:42.180\nAnd that's what, that's what Graham was.\n\n25:42.180 --> 25:44.540\nAnd, and he could have gotten a man's briefcase\n\n25:44.540 --> 25:45.780\nif he had wanted to.\n\n25:45.780 --> 25:47.780\nBut he, he, he, that wouldn't have been logical.\n\n25:47.780 --> 25:50.220\nWhy would he buy a man's briefcase to appease\n\n25:50.220 --> 25:51.740\nlike some kind of weird.\n\n25:51.740 --> 25:52.580\nSo he just walked around with this-\n\n25:52.580 --> 25:53.740\nWhat was in the briefcase?\n\n25:53.740 --> 25:55.700\nDungeons and Dragons equipment.\n\n25:55.700 --> 26:00.700\nAnd, and all of his perfect homework assignments\n\n26:00.700 --> 26:02.380\nthat he probably did on the bus with his,\n\n26:02.380 --> 26:05.420\nwith his mind in a, in a, in a laser pencil.\n\n26:05.420 --> 26:06.460\nDo we know where he is now?\n\n26:06.460 --> 26:07.780\nHave you, have you followed up with this guy?\n\n26:07.780 --> 26:09.660\nHe ended up going to MIT.\n\n26:10.660 --> 26:12.700\nEither that or it was a pathological liar.\n\n26:12.700 --> 26:14.900\nBut, but he said, I think, I think he always wanted\n\n26:14.900 --> 26:16.620\nto go to MIT and I think he got accepted there.\n\n26:16.620 --> 26:18.100\nAnd I never, I never really saw him again.\n\n26:18.100 --> 26:19.260\nActually I did.\n\n26:19.260 --> 26:20.700\nI was in my twenties.\n\n26:20.700 --> 26:23.780\nHe came and hung out and he had a big tank\n\n26:23.780 --> 26:26.060\nof nitrous oxide in the back of a pickup truck.\n\n26:26.060 --> 26:29.940\nAnd a garbage bag and we just-\n\n26:29.940 --> 26:31.580\nMaybe he was a dentist?\n\n26:31.580 --> 26:35.940\nWe just, we just, we just huffed nitrous all night\n\n26:37.140 --> 26:40.500\nout of a big giant plastic bag and talked about science.\n\n26:41.660 --> 26:42.700\nAnd then he left again.\n\n26:42.700 --> 26:44.900\nHe was like, he was like Lazlo in real genius.\n\n26:44.900 --> 26:45.740\nHe was like-\n\n26:45.740 --> 26:46.580\nThat's why I picture him.\n\n26:46.580 --> 26:47.420\nI'm picturing that.\n\n26:47.420 --> 26:48.860\nThat's a good, that's a good image to have.\n\n26:48.860 --> 26:50.380\nI don't know if he could pull off that beard,\n\n26:50.380 --> 26:52.780\nbut he was, but yeah.\n\n26:52.780 --> 26:54.900\nHe was the greatest Dungeon Master in the world.\n\n26:54.900 --> 26:56.300\nWhat makes you a good Dungeon Master?\n\n26:56.300 --> 27:00.420\nYou have to be, you have to be the world's biggest nerd\n\n27:00.420 --> 27:02.180\nand strangely arrogant about it.\n\n27:02.180 --> 27:04.620\nYou have to like, you have to be so proud\n\n27:04.620 --> 27:09.420\nof like how smart and logical you are.\n\n27:09.420 --> 27:12.340\nDidn't we try to play this as adults,\n\n27:12.340 --> 27:13.180\nbut with your-\n\n27:13.180 --> 27:14.020\nYeah, I tried to Dungeon Master.\n\n27:14.020 --> 27:14.980\nIt was terrible.\n\n27:14.980 --> 27:15.820\nIt was terrible.\n\n27:15.820 --> 27:16.660\nIt was the worst.\n\n27:16.660 --> 27:18.260\nYou think you would be good at being a Dungeon Master?\n\n27:18.260 --> 27:19.100\nNo.\n\n27:19.100 --> 27:19.940\nYou're an arrogant nerd.\n\n27:19.940 --> 27:22.740\nI am, but not arrogant enough.\n\n27:22.740 --> 27:25.300\nJust, just, I don't know.\n\n27:25.300 --> 27:27.580\nMaybe I spoke too much pot in my life or something.\n\n27:27.580 --> 27:28.500\nI don't know what it is.\n\n27:28.500 --> 27:29.340\nI'm not good at it.\n\n27:29.340 --> 27:31.260\nI worry too much about what people think about me.\n\n27:31.260 --> 27:32.340\nThat's what it is.\n\n27:32.340 --> 27:33.580\nYou can't be a good Dungeon Master\n\n27:33.580 --> 27:36.740\nif you're worried about doing a good job as a Dungeon Master.\n\n27:36.740 --> 27:38.820\nDid everybody got that?\n\n27:38.820 --> 27:40.740\nAnybody else have another

28:04.620\nHe just had a purple hat on.\n\n28:05.620 --> 28:06.460\nOh, that's not what I did.\n\n28:06.460 --> 28:07.380\nOh, sorry, BJ.\n\n28:07.380 --> 28:08.220\nI wasn't referring to

cross-legged on the floor,\n\n29:06.380 --> 29:07.740\nI'd be reading a book and then I'd feel like,\n\n29:07.740 --> 29:09.460\nah, I gotta take a shit.\n\n29:09.460 --> 29:10.300\nGet

iRobot.\n\n29:16.980 --> 29:17.820\nIt's amazing.\n\n29:17.820 --> 29:19.420\nYou're still gonna be seated when you read.\n\n29:19.420 --> 29:20.420\nI didn't get that part.\n\n29:20.420 --> 29:21.380\nI didn't understand that.\n\n29:21.380 --> 29:23.420\nI just would shit my pants.\n\n29:23.420 --> 29:24.980\nYou're saying you were that into that book\n\n29:24.980 --> 29:26.860\nor you were that that lazy or what's that?\n\n29:26.860 --> 29:29.340\nI don't, I can't, I can't, I don't really.\n\n29:29.340 --> 29:31.180\nMaybe you just have a weird butt.\n\n29:31.180 --> 29:32.580\nMaybe I have less muscle control.\n\n29:32.580 --> 29:34.500\nI don't know, kids do, kids shit their pants, man.\n\n29:34.500 --> 29:37.540\nYou're acting like, you're acting like they don't and they do.\n\n29:37.540 --> 29:38.780\nKids shit their pants.\n\n29:38.780 --> 29:42.780\nI'm not just playing like the foil to you right now.\n\n29:42.780 --> 29:46.980\nI've never heard of anyone that constantly shit their pants.\n\n29:46.980 --> 29:47.980\nOld people.\n\n29:49.980 --> 29:51.300\nNot the little people.\n\n29:51.300 --> 29:54.540\nDo you remember when we had Adam come up\n\n29:54.540 --> 29:55.900\nand read that email from my brother?\n\n29:55.900 --> 29:56.740\nRemember that?\n\n29:56.740 --> 29:57.580\nYes.\n\n29:57.580 --> 30:00.540\nAnd he referred to a story that my mom told\n\n30:00.540 --> 30:02.020\nabout how they used to put me in a closet\n\n30:02.020 --> 30:04.340\nwhen I was a kid with books.\n\n30:04.340 --> 30:07.340\nThat's a reference to, when I was in kindergarten,\n\n30:07.340 --> 30:09.060\nI already knew how to read\n\n30:09.060 --> 30:11.420\nand they wanted to know how well I could read\n\n30:11.420 --> 30:13.460\nbecause I came into kindergarten, I can read.\n\n30:13.460 --> 30:15.300\nSo they would, this was in the 70s,\n\n30:15.300 --> 30:17.100\nthey didn't, it wasn't politically incorrect\n\n30:17.100 --> 30:18.740\nto like track kids and stuff.\n\n30:18.740 --> 30:20.780\nIf you were, they wanted to know who's smart,\n\n30:20.780 --> 30:22.380\nwho's dumb, how smart are you,\n\n30:22.380 --> 30:24.660\nhow smart can you be and all that stuff.\n\n30:24.660 --> 30:26.940\nWe later realized it's kind of a fucked up thing to do.\n\n30:26.940 --> 30:30.380\nBut back then in the 70s, it was, it was the Wild West.\n\n30:30.380 --> 30:32.780\nEveryone was looking for a meteor man.\n\n30:32.780 --> 30:37.460\nAnd I could read, so they would take me,\n\n30:37.460 --> 30:39.020\nthis lady, Miss Piana would come\n\n30:39.020 --> 30:41.140\nand she would get me, all the kids would start playing\n\n30:41.140 --> 30:45.260\nwith blocks and stuff and then this beautiful,\n\n30:45.260 --> 30:47.020\nI remember it was beautiful and tall,\n\n30:47.020 --> 30:50.060\nbut it was probably the third woman I'd ever seen\n\n30:50.060 --> 30:51.260\nand I was two feet tall.\n\n30:51.260 --> 30:54.940\nSo, and she would take me to this closet.\n\n30:54.940 --> 30:57.380\nIt was like a storage closet filled with all these books\n\n30:57.380 --> 30:59.300\nand like overhead projectors and stuff.\n\n30:59.300 --> 31:01.700\nAnd then she, it's not like they could devote resources\n\n31:01.700 --> 31:03.500\nto that, so they would just sit there.\n\n31:03.500 --> 31:04.860\nSo she would put a book in front of me\n\n31:04.860 --> 31:06.220\nand she'd go read this chapter\n\n31:06.220 --> 31:07.660\nand then answer the questions at the end of it.\n\n31:07.660 --> 31:08.500\nGive me a piece of paper.\n\n31:08.500 --> 31:10.180\nShe would separate you from the rest of the kids.\n\n31:10.180 --> 31:11.020\nYeah.\n\n31:11.020 --> 31:11.840\nPut you in a room.\n\n31:11.840 --> 31:12.680\nIt turned out to be a great idea.\n\n31:12.680 --> 31:15.100\nIt looked like the Count of Money Cristo in there.\n\n31:15.100 --> 31:15.940\nYeah, yeah.\n\n31:15.940 --> 31:17.380\nSo the kids loved me for it.\n\n31:17.380 --> 31:18.220\nIt was great.\n\n31:18.220 --> 31:19.260\nBecause I would come back to recess\n\n31:19.260 --> 31:22.820\nand they'd be like, oh, it's our hero.\n\n31:22.820 --> 31:25.620\nIt's the, please, please.\n\n31:25.620 --> 31:26.860\nWe were just learning football.\n\n31:26.860 --> 31:28.500\nLet us catch you up on things.\n\n31:28.500 --> 31:31.980\nNo, it was, I'm not complaining.\n\n31:31.980 --> 31:33.500\nI got to read a lot of dumb shit\n\n31:33.500 --> 31:35.980\nabout that nothing I can remember.\n\n31:35.980 --> 31:36.980\nBut they would go, okay,\n\n31:36.980 --> 31:38.700\nand then fill out this thing after you finish reading it.\n\n31:38.700 --> 31:40.180\nBut then she'd take off.\n\n31:40.180 --> 31:42.980\nSo that just reminded me of that thing\n\n31:42.980 --> 31:45.500\nbecause I had to pee really bad,\n\n31:45.500 --> 31:46.740\nbut I was in kindergarten.\n\n31:46.740 --> 31:48.580\nI never had gone pee without somebody\n\n31:48.580 --> 31:50.020\nhelping me go pee before.\n\n31:50.020 --> 31:53.220\nAnd so she told me when the bell rings,\n\n31:53.220 --> 31:54.140\nyou can go to lunch.\n\n31:54.140 --> 31:56.300\nAnd for some reason I knew what that meant\n\n31:56.300 --> 31:57.740\nthat I would be able to get up out of the chair\n\n31:57.740 --> 31:58.580\nand go to lunch.\n\n31:58.580 --> 31:59.620\nBut she never came back.\n\n31:59.620 --> 32:01.380\nAnd I had to pee really bad.\n\n32:01.380 --> 32:03.020\nAnd I couldn't tell time.\n\n32:03.020 --> 32:05.180\nSo I just knew I was waiting for this bell to ring\n\n32:05.180 --> 32:06.340\nso I could get up and go to lunch.\n\n32:06.340 --> 32:09.300\nAnd then maybe I could get someone to help me pee.\n\n32:09.300 --> 32:11.660\nBut I just stared at this clock.\n\n32:11.660 --> 32:13.660\nAnd I never knew, and then I was just like,\n\n32:13.660 --> 32:15.580\nyou know, if you've ever tried to hold your pee,\n\n32:15.580 --> 32:17.620\nlike, and then when you're a little kid,\n\n32:17.620 --> 32:18.780\nyou're a little bladder.\n\n32:18.780 --> 32:20.380\nIt hasn't fought any dragons yet, you know?\n\n32:20.380 --> 32:24.820\nYou haven't gone to your frat parties or anything.\n\n32:24.820 --> 32:28.580\nIt's just a little muscle, just like trying to hold it\n\n32:28.580 --> 32:30.340\non those Flintstones vitamins and things.\n\n32:30.340 --> 32:36.060\nAnd so I just stared at this mysterious circular dial.\n\n32:36.060 --> 32:37.940\nAnd then the bell never rang.\n\n32:37.940 --> 32:41.020\nAnd then I was just like, all right, here goes nothing.\n\n32:41.020 --> 32:44.420\nAnd I just pissed myself.\n\n32:44.420 --> 32:49.620\nAnd as I was pissing, I don't know if it's the same for women.\n\n32:49.620 --> 32:53.860\nBut once you start, you can't just, it's not like a valve.\n\n32:53.860 --> 32:54.980\nIt's like Pringles.\n\n32:54.980 --> 32:57.140\nStart, and then it's like Pringles.\n\n32:57.140 --> 32:59.740\nIt's a lot like Pringles.\n\n32:59.740 --> 33:02.260\nOnce you pop, yeah.\n\n33:02.260 --> 33:05.700\nSo yeah, at the apex of me relieving myself\n\n33:05.700 --> 33:09.500\nin my little Oshkosh bagash overalls\n\n33:09.500 --> 33:14.500\nwith a little iron on D on the front of them, for real,\n\n33:14.500 --> 33:15.940\nwhich I called my D pants.\n\n33:15.940 --> 33:18.140\nMy mom made them on a red denim.\n\n33:18.140 --> 33:23.740\nAnd they had a little blue sunflower, cornflower blue D\n\n33:23.740 --> 33:26.060\nand a little, and I called them my D pants.\n\n33:26.060 --> 33:28.220\nAnd I always wanted to wear them.\n\n33:28.220 --> 33:30.380\nAnd so these are what I'm pissing in.\n\n33:30.380 --> 33:32.300\nAnd the bell's ringing while I'm,\n\n33:32.300 --> 33:34.380\nand so now the bell rang so now I can leave.\n\n33:34.380 --> 33:36.780\nSo I just remember getting up and just looking back\n\n33:36.780 --> 33:39.220\nat this chair in the middle of a storage closet\n\n33:39.220 --> 33:41.500\nwith a big puddle of piss around it.\n\n33:41.500 --> 33:44.740\nAnd kind of going like, well, fuck her.\n\n33:44.740 --> 33:45.580\nClean it up.\n\n33:45.580 --> 33:48.420\nClean up your mess.\n\n33:48.420 --> 33:50.060\nAnd then I went downstairs to lunch.\n\n33:50.060 --> 33:52.780\nAnd for some reason, I thought that because it\n\n33:52.780 --> 33:57.180\nwas in my pants, I thought that the semantics of peeing\n\n33:57.180 --> 34:00.460\nin your pants somehow applied to the privacy\n\n34:00.460 --> 34:01.460\nand the containment.\n\n34:01.460 --> 34:06.700\nI didn't understand yet that it's darker where all the pee is.\n\n34:06.700 --> 34:09.500\nAnd it looks like I just rode a horse made of spray paint.\n\n34:09.500 --> 34:13.420\nYou know, I'm just down in the lunch line.\n\n34:13.420 --> 34:15.940\nAnd there's just, I'm wearing my little red denim pants.\n\n34:15.940 --> 34:21.740\nAnd I just have a black fucking saddle, whatever you call that.\n\n34:21.740 --> 34:23.260\nAnd my brother was down there.\n\n34:23.260 --> 34:24.540\nMy big brother is five years older.\n\n34:24.540 --> 34:26.780\nAnd he, you know, my brother, it's\n\n34:26.780 --> 34:28.220\nimportant to have a big brother.\n\n34:28.220 --> 34:30.900\nLike they can stick up for you to bullies and stuff like that.\n\n34:30.900 --> 34:33.700\nAnd so I came down to the lunch line and my brother looked.\n\n34:33.700 --> 34:37.500\nAnd we're like, Jesus Christ, did you piss your fucking pants?\n\n34:37.500 --> 34:39.620\nAnd all the sixth graders are like, holy shit, he did.\n\n34:39.620 --> 34:41.340\nThey were actually more embarrassed for me than my brother.\n\n34:41.340 --> 34:45.100\nMy brother wanted to talk it out a little more.\n\n34:45.100 --> 34:48.860\nWere you there at the price is right when the woman, Peter,\n\n34:48.860 --> 34:49.380\npants?\n\n34:49.380 --> 34:50.300\nYou weren't there, right?\n\n34:50.300 --> 34:50.620\nNo.\n\n34:50.620 --> 34:51.700\nDoesn't that happen every week?\n\n34:51.700 --> 34:55.300\nWell, we're both friends with Drew Carey.\n\n34:55.300 --> 34:56.220\nAnd he just got the job.\n\n34:56.220 --> 34:57.380\nAnd I wanted to go see it.\n\n34:57.380 --> 34:59.340\nWe haven't talked about this in the show before, have we?\n\n34:59.340 --> 35:00.940\nGod damn it, it was so good.\n\n35:00.940 --> 35:01.980\nI wanted to go see Drew.\n\n35:01.980 --> 35:04.340\nAnd he's like, hey, come on down to, like, price is right.\n\n35:04.340 --> 35:05.260\nI really love doing this job.\n\n35:05.260 --> 35:05.700\nIt's really fun.\n\n35:05.700 --> 35:06.820\nAnd I'm hosting this thing.\n\n35:06.820 --> 35:08.780\nIt's like a big rock concert.\n\n35:08.780 --> 35:09.180\nIt's great.\n\n35:09.180 --> 35:09.660\nKeep talking.\n\n35:09.660 --> 35:10.260\nWe're going to drink.\n\n35:10.260 --> 35:10.620\nAll right.\n\n35:10.620 --> 35:11.340\nDan's going to make a drink.\n\n35:11.340 --> 35:12.940\nAnd so what you're right there in the thick of it.\n\n35:12.940 --> 35:13.780\nAnd it's pretty exciting.\n\n35:13.780 --> 35:16.540\nAnd if anyone's ever been to the taping of that,\n\n35:16.540 --> 35:18.500\nit's like going to like a Beatles concert.\n\n35:18.500 --> 35:21.700\nPeople are so happy, and so people are screaming.\n\n35:21.700 --> 35:23.140\nIt's really delightful.\n\n35:23.140 --> 35:25.420\nAnd you got a little yodeling guy that goes up the thing.\n\n35:25.420 --> 35:28.260\nGod damn it, I love that fucker.\n\n35:28.260 --> 35:30.140\nDan was there, like, kind of bashful.\n\n35:30.140 --> 35:31.740\nYou're getting your Plinko chips.\n\n35:31.740 --> 35:33.900\nAnd you're like, is the kitty litter cost $35?\n\n35:33.900 --> 35:34.740\nIt cost $25.\n\n35:34.740 --> 35:36.220\nAnd Dan's like, it cost $35.\n\n35:36.220 --> 35:37.060\nThat's the kitty litter.\n\n35:37.060 --> 35:38.540\nI buy the same kitty litter.\n\n35:38.540 --> 35:40.060\nI'm like, yell it out.\n\n35:40.060 --> 35:41.740\nAnd Dan's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n35:41.740 --> 35:42.940\nShe's looking at the audience.\n\n35:42.940 --> 35:44.540\nYou have the same kitty litter.\n\n35:44.540 --> 35:46.180\nHey, I don't know what that is.\n\n35:46.180 --> 35:49.980\nYou got really nervous about it, you're like, $35, $35.\n\n35:49.980 --> 35:52.460\nAnd she gets it right, and it's like, it's exciting as shit.\n\n35:52.460 --> 35:54.780\nSo there's a woman that gets up there.\n\n35:54.780 --> 35:56.340\nAnd she, I don't know.\n\n35:56.340 --> 35:58.300\nI would maybe put her at 40-ish.\n\n35:58.300 --> 36:01.900\nAnd probably a mom, a couple kids, and just a nice lady.\n\n36:01.900 --> 36:03.540\nGot a little mom jeans on, a little blouse.\n\n36:03.540 --> 36:05.500\nAnd she comes up and she's down in contestants' room.\n\n36:05.500 --> 36:06.900\nI'm sitting right behind her.\n\n36:06.900 --> 36:09.660\nAnd I'm sitting with a bunch of Marines.\n\n36:09.660 --> 36:13.500\nAnd this woman, she's one of the first people called down.\n\n36:13.500 --> 36:16.140\nShe's there from the very beginning.\n\n36:16.140 --> 36:18.380\nAnd from the get-go, she is losing her mind.\n\n36:18.380 --> 36:21.020\nBut she's also holding her crotch in the pee-pee dance\n\n36:21.020 --> 36:22.060\nfashion.\n\n36:22.060 --> 36:23.020\nSo she's doing like that.\n\n36:23.020 --> 36:28.900\nShe's happy as can be, but she's holding her pussy.\n\n36:28.900 --> 36:32.060\nLike a little baby holds your crotch when you try to,\n\n36:32.060 --> 36:34.500\nyou think that that can stop the flow.\n\n36:34.500 --> 36:35.820\nAnd it can't, but you do your best.\n\n36:35.820 --> 36:37.300\nIt's the mind of her matter.\n\n36:37.300 --> 36:38.620\nAnd she's just smiling and happy.\n\n36:38.620 --> 36:40.260\nShe overbids on the washer and dryer.\n\n36:40.260 --> 36:41.620\nAnd then they go up and do that.\n\n36:41.620 --> 36:43.780\nThen she overbids, they're underbids on the pool table.\n\n36:43.780 --> 36:45.860\nAnd then they go to commercial, and she's still there.\n\n36:45.860 --> 36:47.780\nBut she now is like, every time she's still\n\n36:47.780 --> 36:48.660\nso happy to be up there.\n\n36:48.660 --> 36:51.540\nBut now she's holding on for dear life and front and back.\n\n36:51.540 --> 36:54.020\nSo one around the front, one around the back.\n\n36:54.020 --> 36:56.300\nShe's worried that it's like whack-a-mole, that it's a.\n\n36:56.300 --> 36:59.740\nYeah, it's like that.\n\n36:59.740 --> 37:04.100\nSo the best game in the Price is Right universe\n\n37:04.100 --> 37:05.180\nis, of course, Plinko.\n\n37:05.180 --> 37:10.140\nAnd when you, when Plinko comes out, it's like, it's bedlam.\n\n37:10.140 --> 37:11.140\nPeople go mad.\n\n37:11.140 --> 37:14.060\nAnd well, first of all, you don't know.\n\n37:14.060 --> 37:14.580\nShe bids.\n\n37:14.580 --> 37:15.100\nShe wins.\n\n37:15.100 --> 37:15.980\nShe comes up on stage.\n\n37:15.980 --> 37:16.860\nThe curtain goes up.\n\n37:16.860 --> 37:18.020\nIt's Plinko.\n\n37:18.020 --> 37:23.500\nAnd at that moment, when she had come up on stage,\n\n37:23.500 --> 37:26.020\nI could see the little saddle of the spray-paint horse.\n\n37:26.020 --> 37:27.380\nPee-pee staying on the thing.\n\n37:27.380 --> 37:28.900\nShe had wet herself.\n\n37:28.900 --> 37:31.100\nAnd she was still holding on to herself.\n\n37:31.100 --> 37:33.500\nShe had let a little go.\n\n37:33.500 --> 37:35.900\nAnd the whole audience is like, ah, we got it.\n\n37:35.900 --> 37:38.380\nWhoa.\n\n37:38.380 --> 37:38.980\nNo, sorry.\n\n37:38.980 --> 37:39.660\nShe goes up on stage.\n\n37:39.660 --> 37:40.660\nShe's one of the things she hugs Drew.\n\n37:40.660 --> 37:41.700\nWe see the pee.\n\n37:41.700 --> 37:43.380\nI'm now embracing two Marines.\n\n37:43.380 --> 37:47.340\nLike, we're like, we're closing ranks.\n\n37:47.340 --> 37:49.980\nAnd then the Drew can't see it.\n\n37:49.980 --> 37:52.140\nThe whole audience can see that she's pissed herself\n\n37:52.140 --> 37:53.260\na little bit.\n\n37:53.260 --> 37:55.300\nThen the curtain goes up and Plinko comes out.\n\n37:55.300 --> 37:56.540\nAnd then it's fucking over.\n\n37:59.100 --> 38:02.100\nShe's now, she, but she's like, she just doesn't care.\n\n38:02.100 --> 38:03.100\nShe's jumping about.\n\n38:03.100 --> 38:04.900\nShe's just as happy as can be.\n\n38:04.900 --> 38:06.500\nAnd she's peed herself in the whole audience\n\n38:06.500 --> 38:09.420\nlike, because you put yourself up on stage.\n\n38:09.420 --> 38:12.940\nYou're like, oh, baby, like you're on camera.\n\n38:12.940 --> 38:15.740\nLike, like your family and like, but she just doesn't care.\n\n38:15.740 --> 38:19.140\nSo she becomes everybody's hero.\n\n38:19.140 --> 38:22.220\nAnd I believe you get five little chips, right?\n\n38:22.220 --> 38:23.300\nYou get one for free.\n\n38:23.300 --> 38:25.700\nAnd then you get four bid prices and things like that.\n\n38:25.700 --> 38:26.580\nAnd she gets them all.\n\n38:26.580 --> 38:27.300\nShe just nails them.\n\n38:27.300 --> 38:27.780\nThat's 12.\n\n38:27.780 --> 38:28.420\nThat's 14.\n\n38:28.420 --> 38:29.060\nThat's 38.\n\n38:29.060 --> 38:31.060\nShe just nails the clock radio.\n\n38:31.060 --> 38:32.580\nAnd she's got all of her chips.\n\n38:32.580 --> 38:35.740\nAnd only at that moment, because Drew Carey has to follow her\n\n38:35.740 --> 38:40.580\nup the staircase to ascend the heights of the Plinko.\n\n38:40.580 --> 38:42.580\nOh, that's what, that Drew's the last one to know.\n\n38:42.580 --> 38:43.700\nYeah, Drew's the last one to know.\n\n38:43.700 --> 38:45.300\nBecause Drew's just like, Drew's only\n\n38:45.300 --> 38:46.780\nbeen hosting the show for a few months.\n\n38:46.780 --> 38:49.300\nAnd he's kind of seen a lot of stuff go down.\n\n38:49.300 --> 38:51.660\nBut clearly, there's some other freeze on in the air.\n\n38:51.660 --> 38:52.540\nIt's like, something else.\n\n38:52.540 --> 38:55.500\nHe's just going, why is this woman so focused and clear headed?\n\n38:55.500 --> 38:58.900\nAnd yeah, it's as if she doesn't have anything\n\n38:58.900 --> 39:02.540\nleft to care about other than getting prices right.\n\n39:02.540 --> 39:05.620\nAlso, the audience is in some weird kind of just like,\n\n39:05.620 --> 39:08.780\nlike we're all just holding on to each other.\n\n39:08.780 --> 39:10.420\nAnd we just like, we want her to, we just\n\n39:10.420 --> 39:11.620\ndon't want her to be embarrassed.\n\n39:11.620 --> 39:14.620\nWe don't want to see a woman realize what's going on\n\n39:14.620 --> 39:15.820\nand run off the stage.\n\n39:15.820 --> 39:18.620\nAnd we just don't want to see something terrible happen.\n\n39:18.620 --> 39:22.300\nSo she gets up on stage, and she beats Plinko's dick\n\n39:22.300 --> 39:24.620\nall around the fucking room.\n\n39:24.620 --> 39:27.740\nIt's just fucking 10,000, 5,000, 10,000, 2,000.\n\n39:27.740 --> 39:28.980\nShe just lights it up.\n\n39:28.980 --> 39:32.700\nAnd she won, I think, the second most money in Plinko history.\n\n39:32.700 --> 39:34.660\nAnd Drew is the last person up the stairs.\n\n39:34.660 --> 39:38.180\nAnd he finally figured out what was going on in the room.\n\n39:38.180 --> 39:39.980\nAnd he goes, all right, so and so.\n\n39:39.980 --> 39:42.940\nUp the stairs, oh, boy.\n\n39:42.940 --> 39:47.220\nBecause he was absolutely eye level with her pants.\n\n39:47.220 --> 39:49.660\nAnd he goes, OK, let's just sketch you up here\n\n39:49.660 --> 39:51.060\nand face in the other direction.\n\n39:51.060 --> 39:52.980\nAnd they're like, he got it.\n\n39:52.980 --> 39:53.980\nThey took her backstage.\n\n39:53.980 --> 39:55.980\nI don't know if they gave her a new pair of pants,\n\n39:55.980 --> 39:57.660\nor they gave her a hairdryer.\n\n39:57.660 --> 40:00.140\nBut she came out, she won the fucking Showcase Showdown,\n\n40:00.140 --> 40:03.580\nand the entire building was chanting her name.\n\n40:03.580 --> 40:06.340\nBecause, yeah, and I wish I could remember.\n\n40:06.340 --> 40:08.300\nI wouldn't repeat it.\n\n40:08.300 --> 40:10.660\nBut God fucking bless you for peeing your pants\n\n40:10.660 --> 40:11.740\nand not caring.\n\n40:11.740 --> 40:13.580\nThat's cool.\n\n40:13.580 --> 40:14.660\nNone of us would do it.\n\n40:14.660 --> 40:15.860\nNone of us would do it.\n\n40:15.860 --> 40:17.460\nAll right.\n\n40:17.460 --> 40:20.060\nWhat is your advice, writes an audience member,\n\n40:20.060 --> 40:22.580\nfor screenwriters looking to get into writing for TV?\n\n40:22.580 --> 40:26.180\nObviously, I'm the last person you should be asking.\n\n40:26.180 --> 40:28.260\nThat's not true, because you have shows.\n\n40:28.260 --> 40:28.900\nWell, I got it.\n\n40:28.900 --> 40:30.060\nI remember what I did.\n\n40:30.060 --> 40:33.260\nYeah, I just don't do what I did afterward.\n\n40:33.260 --> 40:35.340\nHow do you get into it?\n\n40:35.340 --> 40:35.820\nDon't.\n\n40:35.820 --> 40:38.580\nI swear to God, this is going to sound like a glib, jaded thing.\n\n40:38.580 --> 40:40.740\nBut I swear to God, it's my honest answer.\n\n40:40.740 --> 40:43.300\nIt's not a jaded, cynical thing.\n\n40:43.300 --> 40:47.460\nLike, it's going to sound, don't have an idea.\n\n40:47.460 --> 40:49.420\nLike, like, like, like that much.\n\n40:49.420 --> 40:50.380\nLike, like, don't.\n\n40:50.380 --> 40:51.300\nCommunity wasn't.\n\n40:51.300 --> 40:53.100\nIt's just cheers.\n\n40:53.100 --> 40:53.860\nIt's just taxed.\n\n40:53.860 --> 40:54.700\nTV is not.\n\n40:54.700 --> 40:58.140\nWe're not going to a sitcom to, like, have our minds blown\n\n40:58.140 --> 41:00.940\nby the concept of the sitcom.\n\n41:00.940 --> 41:03.500\nThat's my best advice for TV, because I think too many people\n\n41:03.500 --> 41:04.180\nmake that mistake.\n\n41:04.180 --> 41:07.340\nScience fiction, maybe, if you want to do a sci-fi drama,\n\n41:07.340 --> 41:09.820\nthen maybe what's drawing people in.\n\n41:09.820 --> 41:13.100\nI haven't never written that stuff or pitched that stuff\n\n41:13.100 --> 41:14.180\nto anybody, so.\n\n41:14.180 --> 41:16.300\nBut you're about to go back into the market potentially\n\n41:16.300 --> 41:18.340\nand write another half hour show, right?\n\n41:18.340 --> 41:21.460\nYeah, I'm closing some deals.\n\n41:21.460 --> 41:23.380\nBut do you have ideas, or are you going to?\n\n41:23.380 --> 41:24.900\nNo, absolutely not.\n\n41:24.900 --> 41:28.460\nAnd I would be a bad sitcom writer if I had any ideas.\n\n41:28.460 --> 41:32.660\nMy ideas start because the system is,\n\n41:32.660 --> 41:34.540\nit's got its own momentum.\n\n41:34.540 --> 41:37.500\nAnd the tough thing for TV writers to learn\n\n41:37.500 --> 41:40.420\nis that you want to, yeah, it's really important\n\n41:40.420 --> 41:41.740\nto be super talented.\n\n41:41.740 --> 41:44.300\nThat's fantastic if you can manage that.\n\n41:44.300 --> 41:47.500\nBut what you really need to do is, like,\n\n41:47.500 --> 41:50.100\nunderstand that everyone wants to help,\n\n41:50.100 --> 41:52.140\nand they're all getting paid a lot of money to help.\n\n41:52.140 --> 41:55.460\nSo just work less and think less.\n\n41:55.460 --> 41:59.260\nYou're going to be just as talented a writer\n\n41:59.260 --> 42:02.940\nwhether you think a long time about what you want to write\n\n42:02.940 --> 42:04.260\nor not.\n\n42:04.260 --> 42:08.180\nWhat you're being paid to do is be smart on paper\n\n42:08.180 --> 42:09.660\nand the execution of a script.\n\n42:09.660 --> 42:12.940\nBut they want to say, could he work at a pickle store?\n\n42:12.940 --> 42:14.220\nJust say yes.\n\n42:14.220 --> 42:15.100\nYes.\n\n42:15.100 --> 42:17.740\nThe answer is yes, he could work at a pickle store.\n\n42:17.740 --> 42:20.420\nBecause then aliens can still invade the pickle store.\n\n42:20.420 --> 42:21.980\nIn episode five, it doesn't matter.\n\n42:21.980 --> 42:23.740\nIf you want to get fired later, you\n\n42:23.740 --> 42:26.500\ncan figure out how to do it.\n\n42:26.500 --> 42:30.780\nMy boss stops all over my soul furiously and regularly.\n\n42:30.780 --> 42:33.260\nIs it Maxigan?\n\n42:33.260 --> 42:37.300\nHow do I get paid more for enduring that?\n\n42:37.300 --> 42:38.620\nI think this person's baiting me.\n\n42:44.860 --> 42:47.380\nI got a book on tape at an airport.\n\n42:47.380 --> 42:50.820\nSomething about lion taming.\n\n42:50.820 --> 42:55.140\nA guy that tamed lions wrote a book for CEOs or something.\n\n42:55.140 --> 42:57.020\nHe was writing a book, but it was all about it.\n\n42:57.020 --> 42:58.100\nI listened to it for a while.\n\n42:58.100 --> 42:59.020\nIt was kind of interesting.\n\n42:59.020 --> 43:00.780\nHe was talking about basically how\n\n43:00.780 --> 43:05.500\nto make assholes think that doing what you want is their idea.\n\n43:05.500 --> 43:06.820\nBecause that's what a lion tamer does.\n\n43:06.820 --> 43:10.660\nObviously, lions can rip your head off if they want to.\n\n43:10.660 --> 43:13.860\nBut what lion tamers are doing is convincing the lion that,\n\n43:13.860 --> 43:18.220\nfor instance, when they stand on those stupid little pedestals,\n\n43:18.220 --> 43:20.740\nthe lion thinks that it's defending the pedestal.\n\n43:20.740 --> 43:24.380\nIt thinks that it's pedestal and that the lion tamer really\n\n43:24.380 --> 43:25.740\nwishes it could be up there.\n\n43:25.740 --> 43:28.100\nAnd the lion's going like, stay away\n\n43:28.100 --> 43:32.540\nfrom my shitty little bongo drum that I'm standing on.\n\n43:32.540 --> 43:35.380\nAnd the audience is going, what a dumbass lion.\n\n43:35.380 --> 43:38.740\nThe lion is really proud of itself.\n\n43:38.740 --> 43:40.980\nThe answer to the question is somehow\n\n43:40.980 --> 43:43.420\nyou have to trick your dipshit boss\n\n43:43.420 --> 43:47.460\ninto thinking that he would be even dumber for not paying you\n\n43:47.460 --> 43:48.220\nmore.\n\n43:48.220 --> 43:49.260\nI don't know how to do that.\n\n43:49.260 --> 43:52.460\nOtherwise, I would have picked a better job than I picked.\n\n43:52.460 --> 43:54.060\nI don't have any bosses.\n\n43:54.060 --> 43:56.420\nWhen I, as soon as I do, I got three years before,\n\n43:56.420 --> 43:59.500\nthey're all over my ass and fire me.\n\n43:59.500 --> 44:01.940\nI don't want to sound like a broken record, but I got fired.\n\n44:01.940 --> 44:05.380\nWhat do you think?\n\n44:05.380 --> 44:07.980\nI mean, this might be beating a dead horse,\n\n44:07.980 --> 44:11.380\nbut what do you think their justification is for firing you?\n\n44:11.380 --> 44:14.820\nWhat would they say in the, like, if you, like,\n\n44:14.820 --> 44:15.740\nSorry, what was the question?\n\n44:15.740 --> 44:18.460\nWhat would they, not their press release answer,\n\n44:18.460 --> 44:20.900\nbut why do you think they fired you?\n\n44:20.900 --> 44:24.820\nOh, it's cost-benefit ratio.\n\n44:24.820 --> 44:30.500\nNBC moved the show to Friday night at 8.30,\n\n44:30.500 --> 44:32.020\nand said only 13 episodes.\n\n44:32.020 --> 44:35.300\nSo that's NBC saying, you're basically almost canceled.\n\n44:35.300 --> 44:37.340\nWe're just about to cancel you.\n\n44:37.340 --> 44:39.860\nSo what is Sony going to do with that clock,\n\n44:39.860 --> 44:40.980\nwith that shot clock?\n\n44:40.980 --> 44:43.340\nThey're not going to give the ball to Psycho Pants.\n\n44:43.340 --> 44:47.020\nLike, what am I going to do with 13 episodes?\n\n44:47.020 --> 44:51.660\nIt's not going to be the thing that makes NBC go, oh, shit,\n\n44:51.660 --> 44:53.700\nwe had you wrong.\n\n44:53.700 --> 44:55.060\nGet this guy back at 8.00.\n\n44:55.060 --> 44:57.420\nPut him at 9.30 on Thursday.\n\n44:57.420 --> 44:58.500\nThis guy's the best.\n\n44:58.500 --> 45:01.700\nIf your motivation is, like, to get a show running\n\n45:01.700 --> 45:03.900\nand syndicated and as long as possible,\n\n45:03.900 --> 45:09.620\nyou definitely, it's not a dumb decision to bid me adieu.\n\n45:09.620 --> 45:13.020\nThat was just a boring answer.\n\n45:13.020 --> 45:15.500\nI'm just an asshole that doesn't,\n\n45:15.500 --> 45:17.060\nI don't take notes very well.\n\n45:17.060 --> 45:19.740\nI don't like, you could give me five notes\n\n45:19.740 --> 45:21.820\nthat if one of them was what I was going to do already,\n\n45:21.820 --> 45:23.780\nI'll say that's a good idea.\n\n45:23.780 --> 45:28.300\nBut it only fools them for three seasons.\n\n45:28.300 --> 45:31.100\nWill drugs be allowed in Harmontown?\n\n45:31.100 --> 45:32.060\nYes, of course.\n\n45:35.660 --> 45:39.220\nWould there be some drugs that you would not allow?\n\n45:39.220 --> 45:40.660\nNo, no, there can't be any.\n\n45:40.660 --> 45:43.540\nHonestly, we have a big problem in this country right now\n\n45:43.540 --> 45:45.780\nwith momentum.\n\n45:45.780 --> 45:48.940\nWe are all freaked out because we go, oh, shit,\n\n45:48.940 --> 45:51.540\nif you legalize this tomorrow, whether it's a certain kind\n\n45:51.540 --> 45:54.060\nof gun and we all, all this stuff makes perfect sense,\n\n45:54.060 --> 45:56.020\nbut it's only given the situation that we have.\n\n45:56.020 --> 45:57.460\nThat's why we have to start over.\n\n45:57.460 --> 45:59.620\nBecause the truth is, hand grenades\n\n45:59.620 --> 46:01.060\nshould be able to grow on trees.\n\n46:01.060 --> 46:03.660\nBut we should have self-control.\n\n46:03.660 --> 46:06.300\nWe can't, because what if some guy just in his garage\n\n46:06.300 --> 46:09.980\ninvents tomorrow, just invents a laser wand\n\n46:09.980 --> 46:11.260\nthat if you touch people with it,\n\n46:11.260 --> 46:13.900\ntheir body just disappears?\n\n46:13.900 --> 46:16.860\nDoes that guy get to be the most successful person\n\n46:16.860 --> 46:18.860\nin the world because he invented that?\n\n46:18.860 --> 46:21.100\nBecause he can't be prosecuted for his crimes.\n\n46:21.100 --> 46:23.620\nHe can't be, he's just going to go up to people.\n\n46:23.620 --> 46:25.220\nYou don't have any evidence to convict him.\n\n46:25.220 --> 46:27.260\nLike the mailman comes over and he goes, fuck you.\n\n46:27.260 --> 46:28.980\nI don't like your cheekbones.\n\n46:28.980 --> 46:31.060\nAnd he makes them disappear.\n\n46:31.060 --> 46:33.820\nDoes that guy get to be president?\n\n46:33.820 --> 46:38.260\nOr is it wrong to hurt people and make them dead?\n\n46:38.260 --> 46:39.940\nIt's obviously the latter.\n\n46:39.940 --> 46:41.340\nIt's wrong to hurt people.\n\n46:41.340 --> 46:43.860\nWe have to remember that that's really\n\n46:43.860 --> 46:46.340\nthe star we're pursuing here.\n\n46:46.340 --> 46:51.540\nWe can't get too hung up in how to make nobody hurt anybody.\n\n46:51.540 --> 46:53.860\nI told the story of, I never told it again,\n\n46:53.860 --> 46:55.380\nbecause we did record it, and I'd\n\n46:55.380 --> 46:56.540\nlike to put it on the website.\n\n46:56.540 --> 46:58.140\nBut it's an old classic.\n\n46:58.140 --> 47:01.660\nIt's my origin story, the story of how my dad beat\n\n47:01.660 --> 47:03.860\nthe living fuck out of me and my brother\n\n47:03.860 --> 47:04.940\nfor playing with matches.\n\n47:04.940 --> 47:09.340\nIt's really my, it's my radioactive spider.\n\n47:09.340 --> 47:10.980\nBecause it explains almost everything\n\n47:10.980 --> 47:15.580\nI can think of about my me as I am.\n\n47:15.580 --> 47:18.700\nSo my brother and I got caught playing with matches.\n\n47:18.700 --> 47:21.180\nMy brother loves setting stuff on fire.\n\n47:21.180 --> 47:22.860\nHe's fascinated with fire.\n\n47:22.860 --> 47:24.500\nAnd he was five years older than me.\n\n47:24.500 --> 47:26.820\nSo we went out in the back bushes,\n\n47:26.820 --> 47:29.100\nand we gathered some dry leaves, and he had a book of matches.\n\n47:29.100 --> 47:31.980\nAnd we were lighting little piles of twigs and stuff on fire.\n\n47:31.980 --> 47:35.540\nAnd my mom came looking for us.\n\n47:35.540 --> 47:37.300\nAnd she caught us playing with matches.\n\n47:37.300 --> 47:42.940\nSo for this offense, as with all major ones,\n\n47:42.940 --> 47:45.900\nthe misdemeanor was always the wooden spoon.\n\n47:45.900 --> 47:46.900\nMy mom could handle that.\n\n47:46.900 --> 47:48.540\nShe had a big bag of wooden spoons,\n\n47:48.540 --> 47:50.660\nbecause they would break on your ass to hit you.\n\n47:50.660 --> 47:52.580\nYou got a lot of wooden spoon people in the audience.\n\n47:52.580 --> 47:54.100\nI can hear you.\n\n47:54.100 --> 47:55.780\nI can feel you.\n\n47:55.780 --> 48:00.260\nFor the felony offenses, like playing with matches, big deals.\n\n48:00.260 --> 48:03.700\nIt was, wait till your father gets home.\n\n48:03.700 --> 48:06.420\nAnd my dad didn't get home until like 9 PM usually.\n\n48:06.420 --> 48:07.740\nHe was a very hard worker.\n\n48:07.740 --> 48:14.660\nAnd a lot of his job seemed to involve some Southern comfort.\n\n48:14.660 --> 48:20.380\nAnd so he, you know, you don't mean porch swings and that.\n\n48:20.380 --> 48:22.860\nSo it's wait till your dad gets home.\n\n48:22.860 --> 48:24.420\nYou got caught playing with matches.\n\n48:24.420 --> 48:29.420\nI'm telling you, this is going to be really bad, says mom.\n\n48:29.420 --> 48:31.180\nMy brother's freaked out.\n\n48:31.180 --> 48:32.820\nHe didn't usually freak out very easily.\n\n48:32.820 --> 48:36.940\nThis is a guy who once crawled out the bedroom window\n\n48:36.940 --> 48:41.500\nin his Spider-Man pajamas just to go fight crime.\n\n48:41.500 --> 48:45.100\nI admired his moxie.\n\n48:45.100 --> 48:47.980\nHe didn't seem to be afraid of much.\n\n48:47.980 --> 48:50.980\nBut he certainly, he knew that we were in for it.\n\n48:50.980 --> 48:55.700\nMy mom took me aside and said, Daniel,\n\n48:55.700 --> 48:57.540\nyou know those little stories you like to write?\n\n48:57.540 --> 49:01.260\nBecause I did like to write the little things that go,\n\n49:01.260 --> 49:05.140\nDan Harmon in the Fabulous Time Tunnel by Dan Harmon.\n\n49:05.140 --> 49:08.980\nLike just these scrawling, like, you know,\n\n49:08.980 --> 49:11.620\njust writing on typing paper and staple them together.\n\n49:11.620 --> 49:12.860\nI got, I wrote a book.\n\n49:12.860 --> 49:16.380\nPay attention to me.\n\n49:16.380 --> 49:19.180\nOnce upon a time there was a bear in the bathtub.\n\n49:22.180 --> 49:23.900\nPulitzer, please.\n\n49:23.900 --> 49:24.860\nI'm precocious.\n\n49:24.860 --> 49:35.740\nMy mom goes, I want you to write one of your stories for me\n\n49:35.740 --> 49:38.180\nwhile you wait for your dad to get home.\n\n49:38.180 --> 49:40.700\nI want you to write me a story about a little boy that\n\n49:40.700 --> 49:45.620\ngets caught playing with matches and regrets it.\n\n49:45.620 --> 49:48.460\nWas she that terrified for your safety?\n\n49:48.460 --> 49:51.300\nWe need to mitigate the beating that's about to go on?\n\n49:51.300 --> 49:53.380\nI feel like part of her was going,\n\n49:53.380 --> 49:55.820\nlet's not lose the lesson.\n\n49:55.820 --> 49:58.740\nBut I think most of her was going, like,\n\n49:58.740 --> 50:00.260\nI want to fuck with you.\n\n50:00.260 --> 50:05.380\nI am basically the bad guy from Tango and Cash right now.\n\n50:05.380 --> 50:08.220\nI want to just kind of psychologically, I don't know.\n\n50:08.220 --> 50:09.580\nMy mom's going to listen to this and go,\n\n50:09.580 --> 50:11.140\nthat's not what I was doing.\n\n50:11.140 --> 50:14.020\nThank you, you're so old, how do you know?\n\n50:14.020 --> 50:15.020\nHow do you know what you did?\n\n50:15.020 --> 50:16.740\nWhat did you have for breakfast this morning, mom?\n\n50:16.740 --> 50:18.820\nAs a special request, as the story continues,\n\n50:18.820 --> 50:22.260\nwhenever she says anything, can you say it as Jack Pellance?\n\n50:22.260 --> 50:24.620\nI'm from Tango and Cash.\n\n50:24.620 --> 50:28.140\nI want you to write one of your stories.\n\n50:28.140 --> 50:29.260\nNo, I'm not going to do that.\n\n50:29.260 --> 50:32.860\nBut I want you to write it about a little boy\n\n50:32.860 --> 50:37.860\nthat gets caught playing with matches and learns to regret it.\n\n50:37.860 --> 50:43.300\nSo I think in my head, if I tackle this adequately,\n\n50:43.300 --> 50:46.500\nthis could be my ticket.\n\n50:46.500 --> 50:49.380\nSo I do, I sit down and I write, once upon a time,\n\n50:49.380 --> 50:50.580\nthere's a little boy I got to play.\n\n50:50.580 --> 50:52.900\nI was like, just lose that fucking bear in the bathtub shit.\n\n50:52.900 --> 50:55.140\nThis is the real deal, Harmon.\n\n50:55.140 --> 50:57.340\nNo, but it's who you are, it's who you are.\n\n50:57.340 --> 50:59.900\nWrite what you know.\n\n50:59.900 --> 51:02.460\nAnd a little boy got caught playing with matches.\n\n51:02.460 --> 51:06.540\nAnd then as dad came home, I just went into all this detail\n\n51:06.540 --> 51:08.980\nabout whether lightning leaves in fire\n\n51:08.980 --> 51:11.700\nand they thought it was a good idea, but boy, did they not\n\n51:11.700 --> 51:12.580\nknow that it wasn't.\n\n51:12.580 --> 51:17.460\nAnd at the end of my story, the dad comes home\n\n51:17.460 --> 51:22.660\nand he reads the story that the little boy wrote.\n\n51:22.660 --> 51:24.180\nSee, you're already getting it.\n\n51:24.180 --> 51:27.220\nThis is how I got fired.\n\n51:27.220 --> 51:29.060\nIt's like, this is confusing.\n\n51:29.060 --> 51:30.180\nIt's a story about a story.\n\n51:33.180 --> 51:36.460\nYou were meta, even back then.\n\n51:36.460 --> 51:41.180\nI think just lazy, but yes, it came to be called meta.\n\n51:41.180 --> 51:42.980\nAt the time, we just called it zero research.\n\n51:42.980 --> 51:49.300\nMy dad, at the end of the story, the dad comes home, reads the\n\n51:49.300 --> 51:55.180\nstory and realizes that the kid felt so bad for playing with\n\n51:55.180 --> 51:58.780\nmatches that he didn't need his spanking.\n\n51:58.780 --> 52:04.180\nAnd at the end, and I gave it to my mom, and my dad still\n\n52:04.180 --> 52:06.100\nwasn't home, and my mom just read it and sighed,\n\n52:06.100 --> 52:13.100\noh, that's what she went through, huh, this is really good.\n\n52:13.100 --> 52:17.940\nI don't buy the ending, for real.\n\n52:17.940 --> 52:19.540\nNot kidding.\n\n52:19.540 --> 52:20.820\nThird act problems.\n\n52:20.820 --> 52:21.320\nYeah.\n\n52:24.220 --> 52:28.260\nSo I'm sorry, I don't handle notes well.\n\n52:28.260 --> 52:32.300\nSometimes it means I'm going to die inside.\n\n52:32.300 --> 52:34.820\nBut she's right, you should have said, and then my father\n\n52:34.820 --> 52:37.260\ncame in, and he kicked the shit out of me.\n\n52:37.260 --> 52:38.860\nAnd I called the police.\n\n52:38.860 --> 52:41.580\nRight.\n\n52:41.580 --> 52:45.460\nHe's now serving 15 to 20 years in a minimum security\n\n52:45.460 --> 52:46.500\nprison.\n\n52:46.500 --> 52:50.340\nThe neighbors came over and said, what the fuck is going on?\n\n52:50.340 --> 52:53.060\nNo one else is doing this.\n\n52:53.060 --> 52:54.340\nYou're insane.\n\n52:54.340 --> 52:57.380\nThis is like a horror movie.\n\n52:57.380 --> 53:00.540\nMy parents always said, later when everyone's parents, if\n\n53:00.540 --> 53:02.460\nthere's anyone in this room that's ever had hands-on\n\n53:02.460 --> 53:04.740\nparents, you know the story, they always go,\n\n53:04.740 --> 53:06.980\nthey turn into little raisins.\n\n53:06.980 --> 53:07.860\nThey're fine.\n\n53:07.860 --> 53:10.260\nYou play pinocchio with them, and they're like,\n\n53:10.260 --> 53:12.020\nyou can never.\n\n53:12.020 --> 53:15.420\nAnd they always go, it was the 70s.\n\n53:15.420 --> 53:16.420\nEveryone was doing it.\n\n53:16.420 --> 53:18.700\nAnd they're like, I didn't name three people who were doing\n\n53:18.700 --> 53:19.260\nit.\n\n53:19.260 --> 53:22.180\nJohn McEnroe?\n\n53:22.180 --> 53:23.020\nMary Lou Retton?\n\n53:23.020 --> 53:25.700\nWho was doing it in the 70s?\n\n53:25.700 --> 53:27.060\nDid you see it on a Wheaties box?\n\n53:27.060 --> 53:29.700\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n53:29.700 --> 53:31.860\nSo yeah, then my dad came home, and the rest of the story\n\n53:31.860 --> 53:32.980\nis terrible.\n\n53:32.980 --> 53:34.500\nBut I never got my spanking, actually,\n\n53:34.500 --> 53:37.300\nbecause my brothers were so bad that there was a medical\n\n53:37.300 --> 53:38.580\ntonsil ward.\n\n53:38.580 --> 53:39.300\nYeah, yeah.\n\n53:39.300 --> 53:42.380\nMy brother had recently had his tonsils taken out.\n\n53:42.380 --> 53:43.740\nShit takes a fucking turn.\n\n53:43.740 --> 53:48.340\nAnd my dad, my dad often, I feel so bad if my parents\n\n53:48.340 --> 53:50.060\nlisten to this, because they're good people.\n\n53:50.060 --> 53:51.260\nEverybody should understand that.\n\n53:51.260 --> 53:53.580\nNow that we're podcasting it, I feel like you can't.\n\n53:53.580 --> 53:55.940\nI think the statute of limitations is over.\n\n53:55.940 --> 53:58.300\nNo, but not on their emotions.\n\n53:58.300 --> 54:00.300\nAll right, yeah, you're probably right.\n\n54:00.300 --> 54:01.220\nYeah, you know what?\n\n54:01.220 --> 54:05.500\nIt would be like hitting my parents with a belt to talk\n\n54:05.500 --> 54:10.860\nabout it would hurt them at a very vulnerable time in their\n\n54:10.860 --> 54:12.860\nlives when they can't do anything about it.\n\n54:12.860 --> 54:14.300\nHow about this?\n\n54:14.300 --> 54:18.740\nDan, why don't you tell the story?\n\n54:18.740 --> 54:20.420\nWe'll record it.\n\n54:20.420 --> 54:22.700\nBut before we air it, and we have the option to edit it,\n\n54:22.700 --> 54:30.580\nhave your mom and dad write a letter or a story about a son\n\n54:30.580 --> 54:33.740\nwho grows up to be a famous writer, has a podcast,\n\n54:33.740 --> 54:36.700\nwho can fucking lampoon those cock suckers.\n\n54:36.700 --> 54:37.900\nCome on, you met my parents.\n\n54:37.900 --> 54:38.300\nYou love them.\n\n54:38.300 --> 54:39.460\nThey're great.\n\n54:39.460 --> 54:40.660\nEveryone's great.\n\n54:40.660 --> 54:41.820\nThe whole world is great.\n\n54:41.820 --> 54:44.860\nThat's how we end up in these rules who are sealed off\n\n54:44.860 --> 54:46.740\nfrom each other, not understanding things,\n\n54:46.740 --> 54:47.540\nacting out.\n\n54:47.540 --> 54:50.700\nMy brother, my dad came home.\n\n54:50.700 --> 54:51.380\nMatches.\n\n54:51.380 --> 54:53.660\nAll right, well, I know what I have to do, because my dad's\n\n54:53.660 --> 54:55.340\ndad did it, and his dad's dad did it.\n\n54:55.340 --> 54:58.700\nNever mind the fact that all these people are insane.\n\n54:58.700 --> 55:01.220\nMy dad took off his belt, and he always had this catchphrase\n\n55:01.220 --> 55:03.740\nhe'd say, this is going to hurt me a lot more than it's going\n\n55:03.740 --> 55:04.260\nto hurt you.\n\n55:04.260 --> 55:09.940\nBut he was always so drunk he'd get it mixed up half the time.\n\n55:09.940 --> 55:12.340\nAnd just say the scariest thing in the world,\n\n55:12.340 --> 55:16.860\nthis is going to hurt you more than it's going to hurt me.\n\n55:16.860 --> 55:19.460\nI know that.\n\n55:19.460 --> 55:23.140\nIt's terrible.\n\n55:23.140 --> 55:25.780\nAnd that's not the way it's supposed to work.\n\n55:25.780 --> 55:27.780\nThat's how cold I am.\n\n55:27.780 --> 55:29.220\nIt's like if a nurse said, you're\n\n55:29.220 --> 55:33.500\ngoing to feel a large stabbing in your arm,\n\n55:33.500 --> 55:36.140\nand then the blood's going to get siphoned out of your body.\n\n55:36.140 --> 55:40.660\nBut just think of puppies burning while I do it.\n\n55:40.660 --> 55:43.060\nNow, what kind of father do you think you would make?\n\n55:43.060 --> 55:45.220\nIf you had kids, let's say you had two boys.\n\n55:45.220 --> 55:48.020\nLet's say like five years from now, or six years from now,\n\n55:48.020 --> 55:51.140\nyou've got a five-year-old and a one-year-old.\n\n55:51.140 --> 55:53.420\nWhat kind of father do you think you're prepared to be?\n\n55:53.420 --> 55:53.940\nI don't know, man.\n\n55:53.940 --> 55:54.780\nThat really scares me.\n\n55:54.780 --> 55:56.180\nMy girlfriend's in the audience.\n\n55:56.180 --> 55:58.700\nI was telling a story last week of how\n\n55:58.700 --> 56:01.100\nI was working on shelving units, and Aaron was there,\n\n56:01.100 --> 56:04.660\nand I cut the shelves wrong at Home Depot.\n\n56:04.660 --> 56:08.620\nAnd they didn't fit for the third time back and forth.\n\n56:08.620 --> 56:12.180\nAnd I just, you know, I kicked shit and threw shit.\n\n56:12.180 --> 56:16.300\nSometimes the cat, before I figured out what the cat was\n\n56:16.300 --> 56:19.420\ndoing, why it was meowing, it turns out\n\n56:19.420 --> 56:21.620\nI had a toy in its mouth, and I wanted to give me the toy.\n\n56:21.620 --> 56:23.740\nBut I started to like, cat would just meow constantly.\n\n56:23.740 --> 56:27.300\nAnd I was like, I don't know, I'd get up and chase it.\n\n56:27.300 --> 56:29.300\nI'd be like, shut the fuck up.\n\n56:29.300 --> 56:30.340\nYou know, I'd get angry.\n\n56:30.340 --> 56:34.140\nBecause the cat was giving you notes?\n\n56:34.140 --> 56:36.540\nBecause I don't know if you've ever met a two-year-old.\n\n56:36.540 --> 56:37.060\nThey give you fucking notes.\n\n56:37.060 --> 56:39.260\nThey give you a lot of notes, yeah.\n\n56:39.260 --> 56:42.540\nThey're not called the constructive twos.\n\n56:42.540 --> 56:43.820\nNo, I'm aware of this.\n\n56:43.820 --> 56:47.140\nI've met my friend's children, and I've read all about it.\n\n56:47.140 --> 56:49.940\nAnd then it's only 13 years before they're adults that\n\n56:49.940 --> 56:53.780\ncan really, like, Dino's daughter now, adorable little\n\n56:53.780 --> 56:55.860\ntigger, I don't know if I'm allowed to say names of people\n\n56:55.860 --> 56:58.260\nwho aren't even legally allowed to defend themselves.\n\n56:58.260 --> 57:00.180\nBut I'm not going to say anything bad about her.\n\n57:00.180 --> 57:01.900\nShe's a little woman now.\n\n57:01.900 --> 57:03.580\nWe've known her ever since she was a little kid.\n\n57:03.580 --> 57:05.260\nMy friend Dino had a little daughter.\n\n57:05.260 --> 57:09.380\nAnd you used to just like, I remember when she liked,\n\n57:09.380 --> 57:10.820\nshe loved Bananas Foster.\n\n57:10.820 --> 57:12.540\nIt was a dessert that Dino would make for her.\n\n57:12.540 --> 57:15.540\nAnd so I would do a little character called Bananas Foster.\n\n57:15.540 --> 57:17.540\nAnd I'd go like, hey, I'm Bananas Foster.\n\n57:17.540 --> 57:19.340\nAnd I'd do a little dance, and she'd giggle.\n\n57:19.340 --> 57:21.300\nI was like a rock star.\n\n57:21.300 --> 57:24.860\nAnd now she's just texting, and everyone's all like,\n\n57:24.860 --> 57:25.860\ncatch a cold glance.\n\n57:25.860 --> 57:28.300\nAnd she's like, blech.\n\n57:28.300 --> 57:31.140\nAnd I want to be like, fuck you.\n\n57:31.140 --> 57:34.780\nJust because I'm not good at football.\n\n57:34.780 --> 57:36.100\nThere's that, too.\n\n57:36.100 --> 57:39.620\nLike, kids, you've only got 12 years before they're actually,\n\n57:39.620 --> 57:43.900\nlike, when they hit puberty, they become like,\n\n57:43.900 --> 57:45.700\nnow they're rolling their eyes at you,\n\n57:45.700 --> 57:47.180\nand they actually have eyes to roll.\n\n57:47.180 --> 57:50.500\nAnd like, using sarcasm and stuff, like, that's only 12 years\n\n57:50.500 --> 57:53.540\nafter it was adorable for one year.\n\n57:53.540 --> 57:55.660\nIt's like, yeah, I'm preparing.\n\n57:55.660 --> 57:56.620\nDo you want to have children?\n\n57:56.620 --> 57:58.780\nI do, really badly.\n\n57:58.780 --> 58:04.820\nBut I just, I'm terrified that I'm not going to be able\n\n58:04.820 --> 58:05.420\nto handle it.\n\n58:05.420 --> 58:07.780\nWas the whimper you were, how you said that.\n\n58:07.780 --> 58:12.460\nI feel, I really do.\n\n58:12.460 --> 58:15.180\nI'm terrified I'm going to be a bad dad.\n\n58:15.180 --> 58:18.540\nAnd I'm also, I definitely, the solution isn't to be one\n\n58:18.540 --> 58:22.380\nof these horrible pussy dads that are all over LA.\n\n58:22.380 --> 58:23.900\nYou see people walking around Target,\n\n58:23.900 --> 58:25.420\nand the kids just screaming their head off,\n\n58:25.420 --> 58:28.260\nand the people are just going like, Martin,\n\n58:28.260 --> 58:29.700\nuse your indoor voice or whatever.\n\n58:29.700 --> 58:32.820\nLike, come on, shame the kid.\n\n58:32.820 --> 58:33.740\nIt's public.\n\n58:33.740 --> 58:36.420\nLike, my mom only had to have one conversation with me.\n\n58:36.420 --> 58:38.100\nLike, she didn't need a wooden spoon for that.\n\n58:38.100 --> 58:40.660\nLike, I said some shit too loud in a Target,\n\n58:40.660 --> 58:43.180\nand she was like, you don't talk like that\n\n58:43.180 --> 58:45.340\noutside the house.\n\n58:45.340 --> 58:47.980\nAnd if she was allowed to, she would have said N-word.\n\n58:47.980 --> 58:53.260\nLike, it seemed like that was coming, didn't it?\n\n58:53.260 --> 58:57.740\nLike, she was like, back in the 70s, everybody was doing,\n\n58:57.740 --> 58:59.140\nthere was only one conversation.\n\n58:59.140 --> 59:01.540\nAnd I was like, we don't, my mom would say it,\n\n59:01.540 --> 59:02.460\nshe would say it logically.\n\n59:02.460 --> 59:04.300\nLike, I remember the logic seeping into my brain,\n\n59:04.300 --> 59:05.700\nbeing a movie theater.\n\n59:05.700 --> 59:08.980\nAnd she was like, what if everyone was talking right now?\n\n59:08.980 --> 59:09.860\nShut up.\n\n59:09.860 --> 59:10.460\nYeah.\n\n59:10.460 --> 59:11.860\nI go, oh yeah, she's right.\n\n59:11.860 --> 59:13.180\nShe's got a point.\n\n59:13.180 --> 59:15.100\nI remember, like, I was at a friend's house,\n\n59:15.100 --> 59:19.900\nand I said something kind of rude in front of, like,\n\n59:19.900 --> 59:21.540\nthe kids that I went to school with.\n\n59:21.540 --> 59:24.020\nIt was like a new school if I had moved into a new neighborhood.\n\n59:24.020 --> 59:27.940\nAnd I said something kind of cocky or, you know,\n\n59:27.940 --> 59:29.580\nthat suspend your disbelief.\n\n59:29.580 --> 59:32.620\nI was a little, I came in a little high on some kid.\n\n59:32.620 --> 59:35.220\nI probably said something kind of arrogant and shitty.\n\n59:35.220 --> 59:38.540\nAnd the mother, who I'd known, you know, a few months,\n\n59:38.540 --> 59:40.860\npulled me into the kitchen and just went,\n\n59:40.860 --> 59:42.060\nwhack, across my face.\n\n59:42.060 --> 59:44.660\nJust another woman slapped you, like, not your mom.\n\n59:44.660 --> 59:48.540\nOh yeah, some woman whom I will never remember her name.\n\n59:48.540 --> 59:49.660\nShe just pulled me into the kitchen.\n\n59:49.660 --> 59:50.820\nJeffrey, can I talk to you?\n\n59:50.820 --> 59:52.460\nAnd I was, like, 12.\n\n59:52.460 --> 59:55.460\nAnd she just co-lobbered me across the face.\n\n59:55.460 --> 59:56.780\nAnd I was like, whoa.\n\n59:56.780 --> 59:59.380\nAnd she's like, you're not better than my son.\n\n59:59.380 --> 01:00:02.380\nOoh.\n\n01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:07.860\nAnd I was like, wow, me thinks he protests too much.\n\n01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.740\nSo I'm fucking her.\n\n01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.740\nI'm fucking her.\n\n01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:16.540\nThat's a long story short.\n\n01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:18.300\nAnd I mean, fucking her day.\n\n01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:22.580\nI am really, like, she's getting that 12-year-old vitamin\n\n01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.080\nJD.\n\n01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.340\nShould we do a, I remember one time,\n\n01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:34.340\nwhen I was 12, around that age, I remember this odd,\n\n01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:37.060\nthis actually bonded me with my mom in a way,\n\n01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.220\nbecause I suddenly realized the cycle of abuse\n\n01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.940\nthat was really happening.\n\n01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.580\nShe told me to feed the cat.\n\n01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:43.980\nAnd I went, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:47.700\nAnd as I said that, I opened the closet door where the cat food\n\n01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.200\nwas.\n\n01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.540\nAnd I bent over to grab the can of cat food.\n\n01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.260\nAnd I felt this unexpected sharp kick in my tailbone,\n\n01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.340\nlike, really hard.\n\n01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.500\nLike, Charlie Brown going for the football hard.\n\n01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.180\nLike, she just put everything into it.\n\n01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.740\nBut she wasn't Charlie Brown.\n\n01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.020\nAnd my tailbone was there.\n\n01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.980\nAnd if you've ever been kicked in the tailbone,\n\n01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:10.820\nand also just any kind of unexpected impact with your body,\n\n01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:15.260\nI had a can of cat food in my hand, and was 12 years old.\n\n01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.340\nSo I'm, like, cussing.\n\n01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.940\nYou know, I have testosterone, like,\n\n01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:21.740\nstarting to kind of go through my blood a little bit.\n\n01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.540\nI probably had a little wispy, like, Hitler mustache\n\n01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.060\nor something.\n\n01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.820\nI got a little prepubescent, like, little\n\n01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.180\nwisp on my upper lip.\n\n01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:34.140\nAnd I instinctively, because some mammoth or saber-toothed\n\n01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:36.340\ntiger is, like, kicking me in the tailbone,\n\n01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:39.940\nI wheeled around, hefting this object in my hand,\n\n01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.220\nthis can of cat food.\n\n01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.780\nAnd this was 80s cat food.\n\n01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.900\nThey used to come in big-ass cans\n\n01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.660\nthat you had to open with a device.\n\n01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.540\nThey hadn't figured out how to make portion them yet.\n\n01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.340\nAnd I turned her out with this thing.\n\n01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:56.540\nAnd my mom, who had just kicked me in the tailbone,\n\n01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:00.540\nshe, like, she made this sound in this face that was, like,\n\n01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:05.020\nah, like, she wilted, like, and I, and I,\n\n01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:05.940\nOh man!\n\n01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:06.440\nYeah.\n\n01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:11.420\nAnd I said, it was like, oh, I get it.\n\n01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:12.940\nIt's just, like, white trash, like,\n\n01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.820\nlarva becoming a bee, you know.\n\n01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:17.700\nLike, I'm supposed to do this now.\n\n01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.700\nAnd I was like, what is your, what did you do?\n\n01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.340\nAnd she's like, I thought you were being snotty.\n\n01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.140\nShe just, she didn't know what she was doing.\n\n01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.380\nAnd she knew what I was supposed to do.\n\n01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.820\nAnd she was okay with it?\n\n01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:35.620\nAnd I literally broke that cycle there\n\n01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.780\nin the pantry that day for my sockets.\n\n01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.900\nI was like, Jesus Christ, no,\n\n01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.700\nI'm not gonna bludgeon you to death\n\n01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.700\nlike Chris Penn at the end of Shortcuts.\n\n01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:47.700\nAnd then have kids of my own\n\n01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.100\nand find a nice closet to store our cat food in.\n\n01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.580\nI'm not gonna keep doing this.\n\n01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:53.420\nAll right, let's do it.\n\n01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.220\nWe had some success with this as a closer for last week.\n\n01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.860\nWe got a bowl full of questions\n\n01:02:57.860 -->
