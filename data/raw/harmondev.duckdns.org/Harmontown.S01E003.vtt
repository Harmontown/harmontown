00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Good evening Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California, how is everybody doing tonight?

00:11.000 --> 00:19.400
Hear ye, hear ye, Harmontown is now in session, please for your absolute delight in abject

00:19.400 --> 00:26.000
entertainment, please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
Now I'm slipping on the street, and I'm slipping on the hill, and I'm looking for a lover.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Thank you very much.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
I'm looking, looking, looking for a lover.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Thank you.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
I thank you, I thank you.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
I'd like to thank Jeff Davis for Comptrolling again tonight, thank you Jeff for coming back.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
And now for those of you who were here and listened to it, Erin McGathy as guest Comptroller last week,

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
she did alright.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
It was really, it was adorable.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
She had her moments.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
It was adorable.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
It was a different dynamic, most assuredly.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Because we're not fucking.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Right.

01:05.000 --> 01:19.000
I saw recently on Apple TV, the gray was on with Liam Neeson, it's Liam Neeson fights wolves.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Anybody by applause, anybody has seen this movie?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
No.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Like a good eight to ten people.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I have not seen this movie.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Liam Neeson is a professional wolf hunter for a corporation.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
He's on a plane, it goes down.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
He spends the rest of the movie with like nine guys that slowly get picked off one by one by these wolves that are around him.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
I imagine the, you know, the luck of being a wolf hunter and then you're, you know, he didn't,

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
they didn't go down in the water, thank God, or he would have been like, I don't know what the fuck's going on.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
No, he knew exactly what was going on.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
And he wasn't very encouraging to the other people.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
He was very informative about wolves.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
And I just, I've been talking like Liam Neeson about wolves like through the last two weeks about everything.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
When I'm making a sandwich, if somebody says like, is there mustard to go, they don't give a fuck about mustard.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
They're killing machines.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
And if they've got cubs and we're within 150 yards of them, we're already dead.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
I have a question because I've not seen this film.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
So what's your question?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Can I ask you, Liam Neeson, some questions about the movie that you're...

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Your questions don't matter.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
We're surrounded by biological killing machines.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
But go ahead.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
If you're a wolf hunter, how come everybody keeps dying?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Shouldn't you be the right answer?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm not a wolf hunter.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Wolves are the hunters.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
They aren't hunted.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
They don't give a fuck what we do.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
They've been around for five billion more years than us.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
They've got a mouthful of weapons.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
They've got six legs.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
The whole movie takes place in the Arctic, somewhere called...

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
They just keep walking and building fires and he keeps explaining how fucked they are.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
I never watched the end because I know from the trailer that he glues glass to his fists

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
and faces off with what's probably the last wolf.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I saw that in the trailer.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I just watched an hour and a half of him telling everyone they're fucked.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
And that nothing they say matters.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
In the first act, there's a guy that's like,

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
So what kind of wolves are these, man? What do they eat like herbivores? They eat like nuts and berries?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
They don't give a fuck about nuts and berries.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
That's a real line from the movie.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
The word fuck is in that movie more than anything.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
More than a Scorsese film.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
Everyone's saying fuck in ways that you never even heard the word fuck used.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
They're just past the fuck salt.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
There is no fucking salt.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
We're in a frozen sea surrounded by killers.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
They've got a kill range of 300 kilometers.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
If we're in within half of that and they've got cubs, we're already dead.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
How did...

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I have questions about that.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I want...

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Well, I don't want to see the movie.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
The movie doesn't matter.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Do you think these things give a fuck what you watch on a screen?

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
They just want to eat your face.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
They can see you 300% further than you can see them.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
Their eyes are like microscopes and telescopes taped to each other.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Their noses are sharper than their teeth.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Their noses are sharper than their teeth?

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Yes.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Who would win in a fight, a bear or a wolf?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
They fight. They hunt.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Sorry, what was the rest of the question?

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
I got distracted by something I could dismiss.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I think wolf versus bear.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
They're not wolves. Oh, I'm sorry, they are.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Sorry, I got a jump the gun.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Our guns don't matter.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
But I jumped them.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
I can't verify it because I don't think I've seen enough of this film

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
to know if you're doing a good Liam Neeson impression right now.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
This is pretty good.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Is it good?

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
It's pretty early in the night for the audience to be sarcastic.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
Those of you who were here last week, I bet none of you were here last week

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
because I went headlong for Inception's throat.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Like an angry wolf.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
And you could feel the rift between me and the flock.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Bo Peep almost got sheaped to death.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
I was listening to the podcast version of it.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
I didn't sense that the audience was disgruntled by your hatred.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
It's their faces. You see their faces.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Just watch you at home that are listening on the podcast.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
You won't be able to participate in this.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Jeff, you focus on them.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I don't know. Inception?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
It's kind of dumb.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Look at that guy.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
He looks horrified.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
But Harmontown is a plan that we have to form a colony.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
We don't want to be dire about this.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
We don't feel like the world is ending terribly soon.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
It's not a huge emergency.

06:43.000 --> 06:50.000
But it takes a long time to start a city of people who can carry humanity's torch.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
So what we want to try to do, probably on the moon,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
I keep thinking it's got to be on the moon because I just don't know

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
there's no place in Texas that's going to let us do this.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
And I don't want to go anywhere where there's mosquitoes.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
They tried that once and the ATF came down pretty hard.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, don't groan it.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I mean, groan the government.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
It's bad form to burn people alive.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
It's a terrible, terrible way to govern.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I feel like it is too, actually.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
We have to talk about religion. We have to talk about politics.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
We have to talk about what we would do with our unseemly citizenry.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
What do you do if somebody does something you don't like?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
It's going to happen in a room full of 200 people.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
You, sir, do something that nobody likes.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Fuck Batman.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
He said fuck Batman.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I like that.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Now what do we do?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Now what do we do with him?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
We fuck him.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
An eye for an eye.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Fuck him?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah, you fuck Batman. We fuck you.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
It's not that hard, governments.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
We figured it out. That's it.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Now what do we do? Let's play charades.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Also, a lot of my answers are, I'm just going to fuck you.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Thank you for doing that. That's not easy to be called upon.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
I'm like a drowning man in a pool. You don't have to applaud him. That's ridiculous.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
You can if you want to, but don't ever do anything here that you feel compelled to do.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
That's bad governing.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Did you not like the new Batman?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I haven't seen it either. I've given up on movies.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I don't even want to go to them anymore.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
You didn't like the new Batman. I haven't heard anything good about it.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
It was silly.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Silly.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
It's silly, he says.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
We should give this guy an identity. What's your name?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Max.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Max.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
She can have a microphone for fuck's sake.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, you can have one if you want.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
Well, here's a Batman we can talk about because a lot of you people didn't even see it

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
and the ones who did probably blocked it out.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
The Tommy Lee Jones Two-Face.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
I was explaining this to my 27-year-old girlfriend today.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
It was like explaining Korea or something.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
She was going, what? Come on.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Batman was sitting in the courtroom?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Wait, is this hanging out?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
She started laughing.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
We were actually watching the second Batman.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Everybody agrees.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
It's a pretty, well, it's certainly the best Batman movie we've ever seen.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Do you think it's like Korea in that north and south that it's divided like Two-Face?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
No.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
No, no, no.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Down the middle of his face, there's the 30th parallel of...

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
No, I apologize.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
I'm all over the place tonight.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
I meant like I'm like an old veteran and I'm going, well, she's going, what were you

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
finding about Grandpa?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm like, well, we wanted the Korea to be different.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Well, who gives a shit about Korea now?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I don't know.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
We gave a shit back then.

09:37.000 --> 09:45.000
What if the character of Two-Face was actually a trenchant commentary on the Korean conflict?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I don't remember which movie it was.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
It was either...

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I think it was the Danny DeVito as the Penguin one.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
I think it was still Michael Cheaton was Batman sitting in the courtroom in his Batman outfit.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
And they show the origin of Two-Face in the form of a newsreel.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
And Tommy Lee Jones is questioning a mob guy.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
And the mob guy doesn't like the way it's going.

10:05.000 --> 10:13.000
So he pulls out, as they do, a jar of acid from his, you know, the pocket of his double-breasted

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
suit coat, your jar of pocket.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
And he flings it at Tommy Lee Jones, who, it's a visual thing.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
I'll do what he did visually first.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
He uses a manila folder to block exactly half his face.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
And that's how he became Two-Face.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
And he has a contentious relationship with Batman as Aaron Eckhart's Two-Face does with

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Christian Bale's Batman.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
In this version, just because, well, where were you when I got that acid on half of my face?

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
And the answer is, I was sitting there in the courtroom and I just couldn't get over the gallery thing.

10:51.000 --> 10:58.000
Like, they show a shot of Batman trying to get over the courtroom, like, little people's court flappy door.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
It couldn't be more ridiculous.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
You have to show Batman, like, taking a shit to ruin the mythology more for nerds.

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
Like, we just sat there in the theater and looked at Schrab and Schrab looked at me and we just, we started making out.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I understand the appeal of Batman.

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
Somewhere in our heart, we want a guy out there that's, like, rich, which represents the fact that America, it does work.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
It's okay to be capitalist.

11:24.000 --> 11:32.000
But, you know, we need a hero, we need a Prometheus who uses his godlike powers to, you know, uphold our value system.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
But, Max, you said the new one is silly.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yes, it's a little silly.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
They're not taking it seriously enough.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Well, maybe a little too serious.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Oh, okay, okay.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
You know what Liam Neeson would say about Batman?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Doesn't matter.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
I'm determined that Liam Neeson pays off at some point tonight.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
He probably will.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
There's no payoff.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
You're not going to get paid, you're going to get eaten.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
It's a weird crowd tonight.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I'm going to blame them.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I blame them.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I don't know what they did wrong.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
I don't know what you guys did.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I kind of blame myself.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
I feel like I blew it by leaving town for one week and the continuity's just gone to shit.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
They're expecting that.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
They're like, where's this show that I got all excited about where the couple bitches at each other?

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
And then they bring other couples up and ruin.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Can I, I was out of town.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
I hang out with Aaron and Dan quite a bit.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
And I see them, they have the little moments of cuddling and schmoopy schmoops.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
And then they frequently have their moments when you're at the great Greek having Greek food

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
and they're fighting about the new improv idea that we have for 40 minutes.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
And it's an impenetrable, lonely place to be sitting across the table from them.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
And then I justifying exit and I have a loser with a guy named Nikos.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
And I come back and they're still talking about the improv group.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
And then one of them goes to the bathroom and I depose that person and say,

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
is this better or worse than being alone?

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
And then they pause for eight and a half seconds.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
And in that pause, I leave and have another Uzo with Nikos.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
And I come back and there's no answer.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
And then they come back and you guys are making out and you guys look so happy together.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
And then you probably go home and have the worst sex of your lives.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
Yeah, I have no qualification for that.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
That's true.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
So after that podcast, because there was a moment, you guys were very self-revolatory.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
And then what happened after that podcast?

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
You guys go home and you got to go to Baskin Robbins on Sunday and you go home and...

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah, that's just, it wasn't really revelatory.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I'm dating me now.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
I'm dating myself with red hair.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I'm dating another person that's like me.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
We don't balance each other out.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
We just sink every boat that we step onto.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Because we just go straight to the asshole section, which is...

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
There's only one seat there.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
We sit on each other.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
We argue about it as we sink.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
We don't call the stern of the boat the asshole section.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
But you know, who wants to die alone?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
That sounds, you know...

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Me!

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
I see it at the finish line.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I don't know.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
When I'm alone, I'm not alive.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
I don't know that I exist when I'm alone.

14:25.000 --> 14:32.000
I feel like there's a swarm of black CGI insects eating my fucking skeleton from under my skin.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
I feel like something wrong is happening.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
That's when I'm feeling anything.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I just don't feel like I exist.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
I'm a mouth with a brain on it.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
And two little legs to walk it around and make people listen to my bullshit.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
If I'm just walking around an empty house, I can't talk to anybody.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I'm not alive.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
You don't talk to yourself when you're at home?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I haven't had enough experience with it.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
But no, I don't.

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
I'll maybe mutter something.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
My bathtub's not working.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
How am I gonna make the jets shoot up my ass?

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
I don't know.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
Where did I put that mannequin leg?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Can't find it.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Frickin' Frickin' Frickin' Frickin' Frickin' Frickin' Frickin' Frickin' Frickin'.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I just do Hannah Barbera mumbles.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Frickin' Frickin'.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
I don't get it.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
I don't get it either, but I know, I know what I like.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.720
Like a good woman to hate me.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.240
No, we love each other.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.720
Now we're gonna get a big fight about,

15:37.720 --> 15:39.560
Erin takes everything I say,

15:39.560 --> 15:41.240
not everything I say very seriously.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.440
Erin and I get in fights sometimes about,

15:48.440 --> 15:50.040
For those of you listening in podcast lens,

15:50.040 --> 15:52.480
she's in row two, seat F.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.880
When I'm stuck, I stand up here for an hour

15:55.880 --> 15:57.480
and I went, for those of you who are new here tonight,

15:57.480 --> 15:58.800
in case you haven't figured this out,

15:58.800 --> 15:59.640
what I do in the show is,

15:59.640 --> 16:02.520
I stand up here for an hour and waste everyone's time.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.000
While I'm doing that,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.640
I say whatever I could possibly think to say

16:06.640 --> 16:09.640
to make you not get mad at me and throw a rock at me.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.360
So in scrambling to say things that get rocks

16:12.360 --> 16:13.200
not thrown at me,

16:13.200 --> 16:16.760
I sometimes will say something that in the drive home,

16:16.760 --> 16:17.600
like Erin, I'm going,

16:17.600 --> 16:21.360
so you like raspberries, huh?

16:22.640 --> 16:25.760
I don't know, I just seem like the funnier word to use.

16:25.760 --> 16:29.680
Well, you know, raspberries, you know,

16:29.680 --> 16:31.600
you called me that when you were mad at me.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.440
That was a terrible example.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.280
I didn't, why didn't I?

16:33.280 --> 16:36.520
It's stupid, I'm the,

16:36.520 --> 16:38.600
is this the worst Harmontown show ever so far?

16:38.600 --> 16:39.440
Okay.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.680
Well, maybe we should talk about that.

16:41.680 --> 16:44.360
That's the, let's go where the energy is.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.200
Let's wallow.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.360
I can answer your job related questions.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.240
I can answer questions that you raise your hand

16:50.240 --> 16:51.560
and shout out.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.320
I can arm wrestle one of you.

16:53.320 --> 16:57.280
Or we can talk about the fact that the show sucks tonight

16:57.280 --> 16:58.800
since that's in the air.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.960
We have a quorum, arm wrestle, arm wrestle this.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.400
Who wants to arm wrestle?

17:10.160 --> 17:11.000
All right.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.120
All right.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.880
What is your name, sir?

17:20.880 --> 17:21.720
B.J.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.840
You have a, you have a,

17:23.840 --> 17:26.440
what could only be described as a fuchsia hat on.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.560
I don't know what renaissance fair

17:29.560 --> 17:32.160
you were recently expelled from,

17:32.160 --> 17:35.240
but I'm glad you could take time out of your busy swash

17:35.240 --> 17:38.520
buckling career to challenge.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.080
You need like a big ostrich plume.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.840
I think that would really put it over the edge.

17:43.840 --> 17:44.680
Nice first.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.080
Nice first, he's getting heckled.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.120
It doesn't deserve that because for those of you listening

17:51.120 --> 17:55.160
in podcast form a guy came up to arm wrestle me

17:55.160 --> 17:58.800
that is already a better show.

17:58.800 --> 18:03.480
Just when he woke up this morning than anything that.

18:03.480 --> 18:07.000
I guess I have to do the Vince Cully check her

18:07.000 --> 18:08.680
and play by play on this one.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.440
Well, there's a man on stage right now wearing

18:10.440 --> 18:13.560
a smart little leather purse kind of,

18:13.560 --> 18:16.640
it's kind of like a Louis Vuitton kind of thing.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.880
It's got a gold chain.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.280
No, it's not.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.120
It's gold.

18:20.120 --> 18:21.440
It's what?

18:21.440 --> 18:22.280
It's gold.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.120
It's gold.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.760
He has a golden satchel.

18:24.760 --> 18:28.680
He has a ladies scarf from season four of the Love Boats.

18:28.680 --> 18:33.680
He has a shirt that says a wicked lot of laughter,

18:34.880 --> 18:38.800
which I guess you're recently at a Boston Comedy Festival.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.160
I would imagine from that.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.840
He's wearing sky blue crocs

18:42.840 --> 18:44.600
and I'm not fucking joking podcast.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.760
The man, it's complicated.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.000
He's got big hair, he looks like John the Baptist

18:49.000 --> 18:50.640
from Rembrandt's Decapitation.

18:50.640 --> 18:55.640
And I'm really gonna throw a fucking wrench in this thing.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.240
He's put his left hand up on the stool.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.080
Oh, oh shit, okay.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.120
Yeah, we're going lefty on this one.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.640
Are you lefty, PJ?

19:04.640 --> 19:05.480
No, you're not.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.360
Have I taken time out of this yet

19:10.360 --> 19:15.160
to describe his turquoise, Varney, ironic glasses?

19:15.160 --> 19:17.840
Look, believe me, I'm all for it.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.640
This is fucking fantastic stuff.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.600
Is anyone taking photos?

19:21.600 --> 19:24.080
I want this on Instagram immediately.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.640
All right, you call the go.

19:25.640 --> 19:29.840
I'm gonna put my hand on top of both of your hands here.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.040
Two great competitors for a worthy cause.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.080
When I take my hand off,

19:33.080 --> 19:34.320
I want you to begin the first person

19:34.320 --> 19:36.760
to put somebody over the edge of the stool.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.080
Set the tone for the rest of what may be the worst

19:39.080 --> 19:40.360
or best Harmontown.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.200
Okay.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.700
And begin.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.420
Okay, let's make it for 50 bucks.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.260
He's kind of a stalemate.

19:49.260 --> 19:50.460
He's purposely, he's thinking,

19:50.460 --> 19:52.700
I can't win because then I'm an enemy of the show.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.140
No, no, he's toying with you.

19:55.140 --> 19:56.700
Trying to make it interesting.

19:56.700 --> 19:57.860
He has a bracelet on in between.

19:57.860 --> 20:00.060
He went to a club last night or recently gave blood.

20:00.060 --> 20:00.900
So maybe.

20:01.980 --> 20:04.500
Have I described, he's got a fucking violet hat on.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.740
Violet, violet, he looks like Miss Marple.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.420
No, what would he look like?

20:09.420 --> 20:10.260
What does he look like?

20:10.260 --> 20:11.100
He's just fucking with you.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.740
I can't, we're just both.

20:12.740 --> 20:13.820
Finish him, BJ, finish him.

20:13.820 --> 20:14.980
Finish him, BJ.

20:14.980 --> 20:15.820
Yeah!

20:15.820 --> 20:16.660
Yeah!

20:16.660 --> 20:17.500
Carmen!

20:17.500 --> 20:18.340
Carmen!

20:18.340 --> 20:19.180
Carmen!

20:19.180 --> 20:20.020
Carmen!

20:23.020 --> 20:24.140
They're cheering over nothing.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.380
They're still locked right at the top.

20:26.380 --> 20:28.660
It's been the Eiffel fucking tower of the empire.

20:28.660 --> 20:29.660
Carmen!

20:29.660 --> 20:30.500
Carmen!

20:30.500 --> 20:31.340
BJ!

20:31.340 --> 20:32.300
BJ!

20:32.300 --> 20:33.180
Gold purse!

20:33.180 --> 20:34.020
Gold purse!

20:34.020 --> 20:35.740
Complicated outfit!

20:37.740 --> 20:38.580
This is okay.

20:38.580 --> 20:39.420
Oh my God!

20:39.420 --> 20:40.260
Day three.

20:40.260 --> 20:41.100
Oh!

20:41.100 --> 20:41.940
Oh!

20:41.940 --> 20:42.780
Oh!

20:42.780 --> 20:43.620
How is it?

20:43.620 --> 20:45.620
Dan took his scarf off.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.700
Dan removed his scarf.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.020
It's like Samson's hair.

20:50.020 --> 20:51.860
Oh, it's like a scarf!

20:51.860 --> 20:54.260
Dan has put the guy's hat on his own head.

20:54.260 --> 20:55.300
Oh my God!

20:55.300 --> 20:56.660
Now Dan looks like he's going to solve

20:56.660 --> 20:58.180
a crime in Victorian England.

20:59.980 --> 21:01.140
They're hands are going to fall on him.

21:01.140 --> 21:01.980
Jesus, day three.

21:01.980 --> 21:03.100
I propose we work together.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.580
I propose we work together.

21:04.580 --> 21:05.420
Work together.

21:05.420 --> 21:06.260
He nodded, he nodded.

21:06.260 --> 21:07.220
He nodded, it's a tie.

21:07.220 --> 21:08.780
It's a fuzz, it's a tie.

21:08.780 --> 21:12.660
Oh, very noble of you, BJ.

21:14.420 --> 21:15.500
Very noble of you.

21:16.780 --> 21:18.100
See, you know what I mean?

21:18.100 --> 21:19.260
I guess on the moon,

21:19.260 --> 21:21.460
Harmontown is just going to be a bunch of

21:21.460 --> 21:24.180
puzzies that give up in the middle of a fight.

21:24.180 --> 21:25.460
When we get attacked by Mars,

21:25.460 --> 21:26.780
we're just going to go fuck it, you guys,

21:26.780 --> 21:27.780
whatever you want.

21:28.780 --> 21:30.260
BJ, everybody, BJ!

21:31.540 --> 21:32.380
Thank you, BJ.

21:35.700 --> 21:37.900
Dan, I hate to tell you this.

21:37.900 --> 21:38.980
He was never here.

21:40.460 --> 21:41.820
We all just imagined that.

21:41.820 --> 21:43.220
That is someone I didn't vet.

21:45.460 --> 21:46.180
But then, but then,

21:46.180 --> 21:46.980
so he would go, you know,

21:46.980 --> 21:48.500
make it grounded, will you?

21:50.020 --> 21:51.020
That's how we'll settle just be,

21:51.020 --> 21:52.340
it's a little bit easier on the moon

21:52.340 --> 21:54.060
because it's one sixth the gravity.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.620
Jesus, we were both trying not to win kind of.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.860
And who do you think actually had, to be honest?

21:59.860 --> 22:00.700
Who, who what?

22:00.700 --> 22:01.740
Who do you think actually would have taken

22:01.740 --> 22:03.140
that one if it had been like anybody

22:03.140 --> 22:06.180
that's ever arm wrestled me would win?

22:06.180 --> 22:07.740
I've never, I couldn't do a pullup

22:07.740 --> 22:09.340
in grade school.

22:09.340 --> 22:10.180
I was always like,

22:10.180 --> 22:12.260
did everybody go to grade schools

22:12.260 --> 22:13.460
where they made you do pullups?

22:13.460 --> 22:15.340
Like the gym pass, like,

22:15.340 --> 22:17.140
it's my imagination,

22:17.140 --> 22:18.420
I don't want to insult you guys,

22:18.420 --> 22:19.940
but I would like to think that everyone

22:19.940 --> 22:21.700
in a Harmontown town meeting

22:21.700 --> 22:24.100
is all of the people who couldn't do one pullup.

22:25.700 --> 22:30.460
And we want to prove that you don't need to.

22:31.940 --> 22:34.380
What it should say in Latin on the flag is

22:34.380 --> 22:39.380
our gym teacher was wrong, people die of heart attacks

22:39.780 --> 22:41.540
every day, some of them were good at football,

22:41.540 --> 22:42.380
some of them weren't.

22:42.380 --> 22:44.260
Like it has no bearing on lifespan,

22:44.260 --> 22:47.740
no tax bracket, it doesn't,

22:47.740 --> 22:50.100
it's just some shit that we were doing back then

22:50.100 --> 22:52.380
to just make everyone uncomfortable and kill time.

22:52.380 --> 22:53.860
I, I, they should have,

22:53.860 --> 22:54.700
they should have,

22:54.700 --> 22:57.580
they should have let us play Dungeons and Dragons more.

22:57.580 --> 22:58.940
I don't need to bait you guys,

22:58.940 --> 23:03.420
but I'm a little winded by that experience.

23:03.420 --> 23:07.220
Somebody ask me the most embarrassing thing in the world.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.140
What's your favorite D&D character?

23:09.140 --> 23:11.380
What was my favorite, like the one that I played?

23:11.380 --> 23:12.540
What is your favorite,

23:12.540 --> 23:15.060
what is Dan, just to repeat in case we don't pick this up

23:15.060 --> 23:18.380
over podcast, what is Dan's favorite D&D character?

23:18.380 --> 23:22.340
I, my character that I played was named Jim Nightblade.

23:22.340 --> 23:27.340
And I was always partial to the throwing knife type,

23:31.180 --> 23:33.300
the thief, the assassin.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.740
Could you describe to me your, your Dungeon Master?

23:35.740 --> 23:36.580
Did you have a good one?

23:36.580 --> 23:39.900
Yes, Graham was the name of our Dungeon Master.

23:39.900 --> 23:42.860
He's the greatest Dungeon Master that ever lived.

23:42.860 --> 23:47.300
He, because he was just insanely like smart and, and like he,

23:47.300 --> 23:50.780
Graham, Graham had hair down to his shoulders.

23:50.780 --> 23:53.220
He never washed it and this was before a Weezer.

23:53.220 --> 23:54.220
So it mattered.

23:54.220 --> 23:59.220
They had these big thick brown frame glasses and his,

23:59.220 --> 24:02.180
he's, he only had like eight shirts and they were all from

24:02.180 --> 24:03.500
different state parks.

24:03.500 --> 24:06.340
Like cause he was, it was obvious that like he had to kind of

24:06.340 --> 24:08.820
like adventure nature fixation.

24:08.820 --> 24:11.420
I think it was like his dad, maybe just like flew the coop

24:11.420 --> 24:14.100
and like, he pictured him out there like climbing mountains

24:14.100 --> 24:14.940
and sandals or something.

24:14.940 --> 24:18.140
And he kind of like, he had this, he had all these t-shirts

24:18.140 --> 24:19.860
that would have like a howling wolf on them.

24:19.860 --> 24:22.620
And I would say Montana or, or the,

24:22.620 --> 24:24.700
and then the next one would be, it would just say Alaska

24:24.700 --> 24:26.220
and there'd be two owls on a branch.

24:26.220 --> 24:28.420
Those were all his t-shirts, but they all had that.

24:28.420 --> 24:32.100
But they all had permanent sweat stains in the armpits.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.940
And the, and the kids in school would just,

24:34.940 --> 24:38.180
they would, their whole four year high school experience

24:38.180 --> 24:41.420
was just the only thing that they got from Graham.

24:41.420 --> 24:46.140
I got worlds that he created with his mind and had a,

24:46.140 --> 24:49.940
had a whole, a whole birth as a human being courtesy of Graham.

24:49.940 --> 24:51.020
For the rest of the high school kids,

24:51.020 --> 24:53.180
they were just, they just figured out 90 ways to trick

24:53.180 --> 24:56.300
someone into raising their arms so they could laugh at his,

24:56.300 --> 24:58.540
they'd go, hey, what's, where are the lights?

24:58.540 --> 24:59.740
Where are the lights?

24:59.740 --> 25:01.340
Oh, they're up there.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.900
Look, there's a sweat stain in his armpit.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.260
Yeah, God, when is that gonna get tired?

25:06.260 --> 25:10.660
But he, he carried a woman's briefcase everywhere he went.

25:10.660 --> 25:11.500
Because it didn't-

25:11.500 --> 25:12.340
B.J.

25:12.340 --> 25:17.340
He, he fetishized Spock from old school Star Trek.

25:17.940 --> 25:20.860
Like he, he really, as a lot of like super nerds do,

25:20.860 --> 25:24.620
like they latch onto Spock or data if they're younger,

25:24.620 --> 25:26.420
because it's like, it's logic.

25:26.420 --> 25:28.340
Instead of like all these trappings,

25:28.340 --> 25:30.100
like all this shit that makes no sense.

25:30.100 --> 25:32.260
Like, can you dribble a basketball and what are you,

25:32.260 --> 25:34.820
why are you, no white pants after Labor Day or whatever,

25:34.820 --> 25:37.060
the fuck, the stuff, there's nothing logical about it.

25:37.060 --> 25:40.780
So you escape into this idea that you're just pure brain.

25:40.780 --> 25:42.180
And that's what, that's what Graham was.

25:42.180 --> 25:44.540
And, and he could have gotten a man's briefcase

25:44.540 --> 25:45.780
if he had wanted to.

25:45.780 --> 25:47.780
But he, he, he, that wouldn't have been logical.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.220
Why would he buy a man's briefcase to appease

25:50.220 --> 25:51.740
like some kind of weird.

25:51.740 --> 25:52.580
So he just walked around with this-

25:52.580 --> 25:53.740
What was in the briefcase?

25:53.740 --> 25:55.700
Dungeons and Dragons equipment.

25:55.700 --> 26:00.700
And, and all of his perfect homework assignments

26:00.700 --> 26:02.380
that he probably did on the bus with his,

26:02.380 --> 26:05.420
with his mind in a, in a, in a laser pencil.

26:05.420 --> 26:06.460
Do we know where he is now?

26:06.460 --> 26:07.780
Have you, have you followed up with this guy?

26:07.780 --> 26:09.660
He ended up going to MIT.

26:10.660 --> 26:12.700
Either that or it was a pathological liar.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.900
But, but he said, I think, I think he always wanted

26:14.900 --> 26:16.620
to go to MIT and I think he got accepted there.

26:16.620 --> 26:18.100
And I never, I never really saw him again.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.260
Actually I did.

26:19.260 --> 26:20.700
I was in my twenties.

26:20.700 --> 26:23.780
He came and hung out and he had a big tank

26:23.780 --> 26:26.060
of nitrous oxide in the back of a pickup truck.

26:26.060 --> 26:29.940
And a garbage bag and we just-

26:29.940 --> 26:31.580
Maybe he was a dentist?

26:31.580 --> 26:35.940
We just, we just, we just huffed nitrous all night

26:37.140 --> 26:40.500
out of a big giant plastic bag and talked about science.

26:41.660 --> 26:42.700
And then he left again.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.900
He was like, he was like Lazlo in real genius.

26:44.900 --> 26:45.740
He was like-

26:45.740 --> 26:46.580
That's why I picture him.

26:46.580 --> 26:47.420
I'm picturing that.

26:47.420 --> 26:48.860
That's a good, that's a good image to have.

26:48.860 --> 26:50.380
I don't know if he could pull off that beard,

26:50.380 --> 26:52.780
but he was, but yeah.

26:52.780 --> 26:54.900
He was the greatest Dungeon Master in the world.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.300
What makes you a good Dungeon Master?

26:56.300 --> 27:00.420
You have to be, you have to be the world's biggest nerd

27:00.420 --> 27:02.180
and strangely arrogant about it.

27:02.180 --> 27:04.620
You have to like, you have to be so proud

27:04.620 --> 27:09.420
of like how smart and logical you are.

27:09.420 --> 27:12.340
Didn't we try to play this as adults,

27:12.340 --> 27:13.180
but with your-

27:13.180 --> 27:14.020
Yeah, I tried to Dungeon Master.

27:14.020 --> 27:14.980
It was terrible.

27:14.980 --> 27:15.820
It was terrible.

27:15.820 --> 27:16.660
It was the worst.

27:16.660 --> 27:18.260
You think you would be good at being a Dungeon Master?

27:18.260 --> 27:19.100
No.

27:19.100 --> 27:19.940
You're an arrogant nerd.

27:19.940 --> 27:22.740
I am, but not arrogant enough.

27:22.740 --> 27:25.300
Just, just, I don't know.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.580
Maybe I spoke too much pot in my life or something.

27:27.580 --> 27:28.500
I don't know what it is.

27:28.500 --> 27:29.340
I'm not good at it.

27:29.340 --> 27:31.260
I worry too much about what people think about me.

27:31.260 --> 27:32.340
That's what it is.

27:32.340 --> 27:33.580
You can't be a good Dungeon Master

27:33.580 --> 27:36.740
if you're worried about doing a good job as a Dungeon Master.

27:36.740 --> 27:38.820
Did everybody got that?

27:38.820 --> 27:40.740
Anybody else have another question?

27:40.740 --> 27:42.900
You want something embarrassing again?

27:42.900 --> 27:44.580
Yeah, try to dig deep, man.

27:44.580 --> 27:45.420
Fucking-

27:45.420 --> 27:46.260
Trying to embarrass you.

27:46.260 --> 27:48.260
Yeah, make this a memorable night

27:48.260 --> 27:49.900
so that you, when you walk out of here, you don't go,

27:49.900 --> 27:51.660
ah, I was at the shitty Harmontown.

27:51.660 --> 27:52.940
You go, ah, I was at the one

27:52.940 --> 27:56.300
where fucking a pedophile tried to attack Dan

27:58.300 --> 28:00.620
and then they wrestled each other to the ground

28:00.620 --> 28:02.340
and then he took off the pedophile's mask.

28:02.340 --> 28:03.180
He wasn't a pedophile.

28:03.180 --> 28:04.620
He just had a purple hat on.

28:05.620 --> 28:06.460
Oh, that's not what I did.

28:06.460 --> 28:07.380
Oh, sorry, BJ.

28:07.380 --> 28:08.220
I wasn't referring to you.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.620
Wow.

28:09.620 --> 28:10.460
Jesus.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.540
Terrible.

28:12.540 --> 28:13.700
I saw a hand shoot up over there.

28:13.700 --> 28:14.900
Oh, that was BJ waving.

28:14.900 --> 28:15.740
Okay.

28:15.740 --> 28:19.060
Anybody?

28:19.060 --> 28:20.260
I'm not an underage child, BJ.

28:20.260 --> 28:21.100
Stop waving at me.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.420
I went back there, yes?

28:22.420 --> 28:25.020
What's the most embarrassing thing you did as a kid?

28:25.020 --> 28:27.340
The most embarrassing thing you've done as a kid?

28:27.340 --> 28:29.500
Aside from constantly shitting my pants,

28:30.420 --> 28:31.380
just constantly.

28:31.380 --> 28:32.580
What do you mean constantly shitting your pants?

28:32.580 --> 28:35.540
Just all the time, just always pooping my pants.

28:35.540 --> 28:37.580
Was that, is that a medical condition?

28:37.580 --> 28:38.420
Is that a thing?

28:38.420 --> 28:39.260
I don't know.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.100
I just, I would, I would, I just,

28:40.100 --> 28:42.540
I didn't like to go to the bathroom and,

28:42.540 --> 28:45.500
oh, there's your problem.

28:46.780 --> 28:47.860
You know, like when you're a kid,

28:47.860 --> 28:49.540
I don't know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to put this off

28:49.540 --> 28:51.180
on you guys, if this, you didn't have a similar experience,

28:51.180 --> 28:55.260
but when you're a kid and you're just learning to poop,

28:55.260 --> 28:56.900
but you're also learning to read.

28:59.180 --> 29:00.500
Learning to poop.

29:02.060 --> 29:03.940
And sometimes you're sitting there reading a book,

29:03.940 --> 29:06.380
like I used to just sit cross-legged on the floor,

29:06.380 --> 29:07.740
I'd be reading a book and then I'd feel like,

29:07.740 --> 29:09.460
ah, I gotta take a shit.

29:09.460 --> 29:10.300
Get up.

29:10.300 --> 29:11.900
Now, get up.

29:11.900 --> 29:12.980
It's Asimov.

29:12.980 --> 29:13.860
I'm not gonna get up.

29:13.860 --> 29:16.980
I wanna finish reading iRobot.

29:16.980 --> 29:17.820
It's amazing.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.420
You're still gonna be seated when you read.

29:19.420 --> 29:20.420
I didn't get that part.

29:20.420 --> 29:21.380
I didn't understand that.

29:21.380 --> 29:23.420
I just would shit my pants.

29:23.420 --> 29:24.980
You're saying you were that into that book

29:24.980 --> 29:26.860
or you were that that lazy or what's that?

29:26.860 --> 29:29.340
I don't, I can't, I can't, I don't really.

29:29.340 --> 29:31.180
Maybe you just have a weird butt.

29:31.180 --> 29:32.580
Maybe I have less muscle control.

29:32.580 --> 29:34.500
I don't know, kids do, kids shit their pants, man.

29:34.500 --> 29:37.540
You're acting like, you're acting like they don't and they do.

29:37.540 --> 29:38.780
Kids shit their pants.

29:38.780 --> 29:42.780
I'm not just playing like the foil to you right now.

29:42.780 --> 29:46.980
I've never heard of anyone that constantly shit their pants.

29:46.980 --> 29:47.980
Old people.

29:49.980 --> 29:51.300
Not the little people.

29:51.300 --> 29:54.540
Do you remember when we had Adam come up

29:54.540 --> 29:55.900
and read that email from my brother?

29:55.900 --> 29:56.740
Remember that?

29:56.740 --> 29:57.580
Yes.

29:57.580 --> 30:00.540
And he referred to a story that my mom told

30:00.540 --> 30:02.020
about how they used to put me in a closet

30:02.020 --> 30:04.340
when I was a kid with books.

30:04.340 --> 30:07.340
That's a reference to, when I was in kindergarten,

30:07.340 --> 30:09.060
I already knew how to read

30:09.060 --> 30:11.420
and they wanted to know how well I could read

30:11.420 --> 30:13.460
because I came into kindergarten, I can read.

30:13.460 --> 30:15.300
So they would, this was in the 70s,

30:15.300 --> 30:17.100
they didn't, it wasn't politically incorrect

30:17.100 --> 30:18.740
to like track kids and stuff.

30:18.740 --> 30:20.780
If you were, they wanted to know who's smart,

30:20.780 --> 30:22.380
who's dumb, how smart are you,

30:22.380 --> 30:24.660
how smart can you be and all that stuff.

30:24.660 --> 30:26.940
We later realized it's kind of a fucked up thing to do.

30:26.940 --> 30:30.380
But back then in the 70s, it was, it was the Wild West.

30:30.380 --> 30:32.780
Everyone was looking for a meteor man.

30:32.780 --> 30:37.460
And I could read, so they would take me,

30:37.460 --> 30:39.020
this lady, Miss Piana would come

30:39.020 --> 30:41.140
and she would get me, all the kids would start playing

30:41.140 --> 30:45.260
with blocks and stuff and then this beautiful,

30:45.260 --> 30:47.020
I remember it was beautiful and tall,

30:47.020 --> 30:50.060
but it was probably the third woman I'd ever seen

30:50.060 --> 30:51.260
and I was two feet tall.

30:51.260 --> 30:54.940
So, and she would take me to this closet.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.380
It was like a storage closet filled with all these books

30:57.380 --> 30:59.300
and like overhead projectors and stuff.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.700
And then she, it's not like they could devote resources

31:01.700 --> 31:03.500
to that, so they would just sit there.

31:03.500 --> 31:04.860
So she would put a book in front of me

31:04.860 --> 31:06.220
and she'd go read this chapter

31:06.220 --> 31:07.660
and then answer the questions at the end of it.

31:07.660 --> 31:08.500
Give me a piece of paper.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.180
She would separate you from the rest of the kids.

31:10.180 --> 31:11.020
Yeah.

31:11.020 --> 31:11.840
Put you in a room.

31:11.840 --> 31:12.680
It turned out to be a great idea.

31:12.680 --> 31:15.100
It looked like the Count of Money Cristo in there.

31:15.100 --> 31:15.940
Yeah, yeah.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.380
So the kids loved me for it.

31:17.380 --> 31:18.220
It was great.

31:18.220 --> 31:19.260
Because I would come back to recess

31:19.260 --> 31:22.820
and they'd be like, oh, it's our hero.

31:22.820 --> 31:25.620
It's the, please, please.

31:25.620 --> 31:26.860
We were just learning football.

31:26.860 --> 31:28.500
Let us catch you up on things.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.980
No, it was, I'm not complaining.

31:31.980 --> 31:33.500
I got to read a lot of dumb shit

31:33.500 --> 31:35.980
about that nothing I can remember.

31:35.980 --> 31:36.980
But they would go, okay,

31:36.980 --> 31:38.700
and then fill out this thing after you finish reading it.

31:38.700 --> 31:40.180
But then she'd take off.

31:40.180 --> 31:42.980
So that just reminded me of that thing

31:42.980 --> 31:45.500
because I had to pee really bad,

31:45.500 --> 31:46.740
but I was in kindergarten.

31:46.740 --> 31:48.580
I never had gone pee without somebody

31:48.580 --> 31:50.020
helping me go pee before.

31:50.020 --> 31:53.220
And so she told me when the bell rings,

31:53.220 --> 31:54.140
you can go to lunch.

31:54.140 --> 31:56.300
And for some reason I knew what that meant

31:56.300 --> 31:57.740
that I would be able to get up out of the chair

31:57.740 --> 31:58.580
and go to lunch.

31:58.580 --> 31:59.620
But she never came back.

31:59.620 --> 32:01.380
And I had to pee really bad.

32:01.380 --> 32:03.020
And I couldn't tell time.

32:03.020 --> 32:05.180
So I just knew I was waiting for this bell to ring

32:05.180 --> 32:06.340
so I could get up and go to lunch.

32:06.340 --> 32:09.300
And then maybe I could get someone to help me pee.

32:09.300 --> 32:11.660
But I just stared at this clock.

32:11.660 --> 32:13.660
And I never knew, and then I was just like,

32:13.660 --> 32:15.580
you know, if you've ever tried to hold your pee,

32:15.580 --> 32:17.620
like, and then when you're a little kid,

32:17.620 --> 32:18.780
you're a little bladder.

32:18.780 --> 32:20.380
It hasn't fought any dragons yet, you know?

32:20.380 --> 32:24.820
You haven't gone to your frat parties or anything.

32:24.820 --> 32:28.580
It's just a little muscle, just like trying to hold it

32:28.580 --> 32:30.340
on those Flintstones vitamins and things.

32:30.340 --> 32:36.060
And so I just stared at this mysterious circular dial.

32:36.060 --> 32:37.940
And then the bell never rang.

32:37.940 --> 32:41.020
And then I was just like, all right, here goes nothing.

32:41.020 --> 32:44.420
And I just pissed myself.

32:44.420 --> 32:49.620
And as I was pissing, I don't know if it's the same for women.

32:49.620 --> 32:53.860
But once you start, you can't just, it's not like a valve.

32:53.860 --> 32:54.980
It's like Pringles.

32:54.980 --> 32:57.140
Start, and then it's like Pringles.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.740
It's a lot like Pringles.

32:59.740 --> 33:02.260
Once you pop, yeah.

33:02.260 --> 33:05.700
So yeah, at the apex of me relieving myself

33:05.700 --> 33:09.500
in my little Oshkosh bagash overalls

33:09.500 --> 33:14.500
with a little iron on D on the front of them, for real,

33:14.500 --> 33:15.940
which I called my D pants.

33:15.940 --> 33:18.140
My mom made them on a red denim.

33:18.140 --> 33:23.740
And they had a little blue sunflower, cornflower blue D

33:23.740 --> 33:26.060
and a little, and I called them my D pants.

33:26.060 --> 33:28.220
And I always wanted to wear them.

33:28.220 --> 33:30.380
And so these are what I'm pissing in.

33:30.380 --> 33:32.300
And the bell's ringing while I'm,

33:32.300 --> 33:34.380
and so now the bell rang so now I can leave.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.780
So I just remember getting up and just looking back

33:36.780 --> 33:39.220
at this chair in the middle of a storage closet

33:39.220 --> 33:41.500
with a big puddle of piss around it.

33:41.500 --> 33:44.740
And kind of going like, well, fuck her.

33:44.740 --> 33:45.580
Clean it up.

33:45.580 --> 33:48.420
Clean up your mess.

33:48.420 --> 33:50.060
And then I went downstairs to lunch.

33:50.060 --> 33:52.780
And for some reason, I thought that because it

33:52.780 --> 33:57.180
was in my pants, I thought that the semantics of peeing

33:57.180 --> 34:00.460
in your pants somehow applied to the privacy

34:00.460 --> 34:01.460
and the containment.

34:01.460 --> 34:06.700
I didn't understand yet that it's darker where all the pee is.

34:06.700 --> 34:09.500
And it looks like I just rode a horse made of spray paint.

34:09.500 --> 34:13.420
You know, I'm just down in the lunch line.

34:13.420 --> 34:15.940
And there's just, I'm wearing my little red denim pants.

34:15.940 --> 34:21.740
And I just have a black fucking saddle, whatever you call that.

34:21.740 --> 34:23.260
And my brother was down there.

34:23.260 --> 34:24.540
My big brother is five years older.

34:24.540 --> 34:26.780
And he, you know, my brother, it's

34:26.780 --> 34:28.220
important to have a big brother.

34:28.220 --> 34:30.900
Like they can stick up for you to bullies and stuff like that.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.700
And so I came down to the lunch line and my brother looked.

34:33.700 --> 34:37.500
And we're like, Jesus Christ, did you piss your fucking pants?

34:37.500 --> 34:39.620
And all the sixth graders are like, holy shit, he did.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.340
They were actually more embarrassed for me than my brother.

34:41.340 --> 34:45.100
My brother wanted to talk it out a little more.

34:45.100 --> 34:48.860
Were you there at the price is right when the woman, Peter,

34:48.860 --> 34:49.380
pants?

34:49.380 --> 34:50.300
You weren't there, right?

34:50.300 --> 34:50.620
No.

34:50.620 --> 34:51.700
Doesn't that happen every week?

34:51.700 --> 34:55.300
Well, we're both friends with Drew Carey.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.220
And he just got the job.

34:56.220 --> 34:57.380
And I wanted to go see it.

34:57.380 --> 34:59.340
We haven't talked about this in the show before, have we?

34:59.340 --> 35:00.940
God damn it, it was so good.

35:00.940 --> 35:01.980
I wanted to go see Drew.

35:01.980 --> 35:04.340
And he's like, hey, come on down to, like, price is right.

35:04.340 --> 35:05.260
I really love doing this job.

35:05.260 --> 35:05.700
It's really fun.

35:05.700 --> 35:06.820
And I'm hosting this thing.

35:06.820 --> 35:08.780
It's like a big rock concert.

35:08.780 --> 35:09.180
It's great.

35:09.180 --> 35:09.660
Keep talking.

35:09.660 --> 35:10.260
We're going to drink.

35:10.260 --> 35:10.620
All right.

35:10.620 --> 35:11.340
Dan's going to make a drink.

35:11.340 --> 35:12.940
And so what you're right there in the thick of it.

35:12.940 --> 35:13.780
And it's pretty exciting.

35:13.780 --> 35:16.540
And if anyone's ever been to the taping of that,

35:16.540 --> 35:18.500
it's like going to like a Beatles concert.

35:18.500 --> 35:21.700
People are so happy, and so people are screaming.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.140
It's really delightful.

35:23.140 --> 35:25.420
And you got a little yodeling guy that goes up the thing.

35:25.420 --> 35:28.260
God damn it, I love that fucker.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.140
Dan was there, like, kind of bashful.

35:30.140 --> 35:31.740
You're getting your Plinko chips.

35:31.740 --> 35:33.900
And you're like, is the kitty litter cost $35?

35:33.900 --> 35:34.740
It cost $25.

35:34.740 --> 35:36.220
And Dan's like, it cost $35.

35:36.220 --> 35:37.060
That's the kitty litter.

35:37.060 --> 35:38.540
I buy the same kitty litter.

35:38.540 --> 35:40.060
I'm like, yell it out.

35:40.060 --> 35:41.740
And Dan's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

35:41.740 --> 35:42.940
She's looking at the audience.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.540
You have the same kitty litter.

35:44.540 --> 35:46.180
Hey, I don't know what that is.

35:46.180 --> 35:49.980
You got really nervous about it, you're like, $35, $35.

35:49.980 --> 35:52.460
And she gets it right, and it's like, it's exciting as shit.

35:52.460 --> 35:54.780
So there's a woman that gets up there.

35:54.780 --> 35:56.340
And she, I don't know.

35:56.340 --> 35:58.300
I would maybe put her at 40-ish.

35:58.300 --> 36:01.900
And probably a mom, a couple kids, and just a nice lady.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.540
Got a little mom jeans on, a little blouse.

36:03.540 --> 36:05.500
And she comes up and she's down in contestants' room.

36:05.500 --> 36:06.900
I'm sitting right behind her.

36:06.900 --> 36:09.660
And I'm sitting with a bunch of Marines.

36:09.660 --> 36:13.500
And this woman, she's one of the first people called down.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.140
She's there from the very beginning.

36:16.140 --> 36:18.380
And from the get-go, she is losing her mind.

36:18.380 --> 36:21.020
But she's also holding her crotch in the pee-pee dance

36:21.020 --> 36:22.060
fashion.

36:22.060 --> 36:23.020
So she's doing like that.

36:23.020 --> 36:28.900
She's happy as can be, but she's holding her pussy.

36:28.900 --> 36:32.060
Like a little baby holds your crotch when you try to,

36:32.060 --> 36:34.500
you think that that can stop the flow.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.820
And it can't, but you do your best.

36:35.820 --> 36:37.300
It's the mind of her matter.

36:37.300 --> 36:38.620
And she's just smiling and happy.

36:38.620 --> 36:40.260
She overbids on the washer and dryer.

36:40.260 --> 36:41.620
And then they go up and do that.

36:41.620 --> 36:43.780
Then she overbids, they're underbids on the pool table.

36:43.780 --> 36:45.860
And then they go to commercial, and she's still there.

36:45.860 --> 36:47.780
But she now is like, every time she's still

36:47.780 --> 36:48.660
so happy to be up there.

36:48.660 --> 36:51.540
But now she's holding on for dear life and front and back.

36:51.540 --> 36:54.020
So one around the front, one around the back.

36:54.020 --> 36:56.300
She's worried that it's like whack-a-mole, that it's a.

36:56.300 --> 36:59.740
Yeah, it's like that.

36:59.740 --> 37:04.100
So the best game in the Price is Right universe

37:04.100 --> 37:05.180
is, of course, Plinko.

37:05.180 --> 37:10.140
And when you, when Plinko comes out, it's like, it's bedlam.

37:10.140 --> 37:11.140
People go mad.

37:11.140 --> 37:14.060
And well, first of all, you don't know.

37:14.060 --> 37:14.580
She bids.

37:14.580 --> 37:15.100
She wins.

37:15.100 --> 37:15.980
She comes up on stage.

37:15.980 --> 37:16.860
The curtain goes up.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.020
It's Plinko.

37:18.020 --> 37:23.500
And at that moment, when she had come up on stage,

37:23.500 --> 37:26.020
I could see the little saddle of the spray-paint horse.

37:26.020 --> 37:27.380
Pee-pee staying on the thing.

37:27.380 --> 37:28.900
She had wet herself.

37:28.900 --> 37:31.100
And she was still holding on to herself.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.500
She had let a little go.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.900
And the whole audience is like, ah, we got it.

37:35.900 --> 37:38.380
Whoa.

37:38.380 --> 37:38.980
No, sorry.

37:38.980 --> 37:39.660
She goes up on stage.

37:39.660 --> 37:40.660
She's one of the things she hugs Drew.

37:40.660 --> 37:41.700
We see the pee.

37:41.700 --> 37:43.380
I'm now embracing two Marines.

37:43.380 --> 37:47.340
Like, we're like, we're closing ranks.

37:47.340 --> 37:49.980
And then the Drew can't see it.

37:49.980 --> 37:52.140
The whole audience can see that she's pissed herself

37:52.140 --> 37:53.260
a little bit.

37:53.260 --> 37:55.300
Then the curtain goes up and Plinko comes out.

37:55.300 --> 37:56.540
And then it's fucking over.

37:59.100 --> 38:02.100
She's now, she, but she's like, she just doesn't care.

38:02.100 --> 38:03.100
She's jumping about.

38:03.100 --> 38:04.900
She's just as happy as can be.

38:04.900 --> 38:06.500
And she's peed herself in the whole audience

38:06.500 --> 38:09.420
like, because you put yourself up on stage.

38:09.420 --> 38:12.940
You're like, oh, baby, like you're on camera.

38:12.940 --> 38:15.740
Like, like your family and like, but she just doesn't care.

38:15.740 --> 38:19.140
So she becomes everybody's hero.

38:19.140 --> 38:22.220
And I believe you get five little chips, right?

38:22.220 --> 38:23.300
You get one for free.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.700
And then you get four bid prices and things like that.

38:25.700 --> 38:26.580
And she gets them all.

38:26.580 --> 38:27.300
She just nails them.

38:27.300 --> 38:27.780
That's 12.

38:27.780 --> 38:28.420
That's 14.

38:28.420 --> 38:29.060
That's 38.

38:29.060 --> 38:31.060
She just nails the clock radio.

38:31.060 --> 38:32.580
And she's got all of her chips.

38:32.580 --> 38:35.740
And only at that moment, because Drew Carey has to follow her

38:35.740 --> 38:40.580
up the staircase to ascend the heights of the Plinko.

38:40.580 --> 38:42.580
Oh, that's what, that Drew's the last one to know.

38:42.580 --> 38:43.700
Yeah, Drew's the last one to know.

38:43.700 --> 38:45.300
Because Drew's just like, Drew's only

38:45.300 --> 38:46.780
been hosting the show for a few months.

38:46.780 --> 38:49.300
And he's kind of seen a lot of stuff go down.

38:49.300 --> 38:51.660
But clearly, there's some other freeze on in the air.

38:51.660 --> 38:52.540
It's like, something else.

38:52.540 --> 38:55.500
He's just going, why is this woman so focused and clear headed?

38:55.500 --> 38:58.900
And yeah, it's as if she doesn't have anything

38:58.900 --> 39:02.540
left to care about other than getting prices right.

39:02.540 --> 39:05.620
Also, the audience is in some weird kind of just like,

39:05.620 --> 39:08.780
like we're all just holding on to each other.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.420
And we just like, we want her to, we just

39:10.420 --> 39:11.620
don't want her to be embarrassed.

39:11.620 --> 39:14.620
We don't want to see a woman realize what's going on

39:14.620 --> 39:15.820
and run off the stage.

39:15.820 --> 39:18.620
And we just don't want to see something terrible happen.

39:18.620 --> 39:22.300
So she gets up on stage, and she beats Plinko's dick

39:22.300 --> 39:24.620
all around the fucking room.

39:24.620 --> 39:27.740
It's just fucking 10,000, 5,000, 10,000, 2,000.

39:27.740 --> 39:28.980
She just lights it up.

39:28.980 --> 39:32.700
And she won, I think, the second most money in Plinko history.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.660
And Drew is the last person up the stairs.

39:34.660 --> 39:38.180
And he finally figured out what was going on in the room.

39:38.180 --> 39:39.980
And he goes, all right, so and so.

39:39.980 --> 39:42.940
Up the stairs, oh, boy.

39:42.940 --> 39:47.220
Because he was absolutely eye level with her pants.

39:47.220 --> 39:49.660
And he goes, OK, let's just sketch you up here

39:49.660 --> 39:51.060
and face in the other direction.

39:51.060 --> 39:52.980
And they're like, he got it.

39:52.980 --> 39:53.980
They took her backstage.

39:53.980 --> 39:55.980
I don't know if they gave her a new pair of pants,

39:55.980 --> 39:57.660
or they gave her a hairdryer.

39:57.660 --> 40:00.140
But she came out, she won the fucking Showcase Showdown,

40:00.140 --> 40:03.580
and the entire building was chanting her name.

40:03.580 --> 40:06.340
Because, yeah, and I wish I could remember.

40:06.340 --> 40:08.300
I wouldn't repeat it.

40:08.300 --> 40:10.660
But God fucking bless you for peeing your pants

40:10.660 --> 40:11.740
and not caring.

40:11.740 --> 40:13.580
That's cool.

40:13.580 --> 40:14.660
None of us would do it.

40:14.660 --> 40:15.860
None of us would do it.

40:15.860 --> 40:17.460
All right.

40:17.460 --> 40:20.060
What is your advice, writes an audience member,

40:20.060 --> 40:22.580
for screenwriters looking to get into writing for TV?

40:22.580 --> 40:26.180
Obviously, I'm the last person you should be asking.

40:26.180 --> 40:28.260
That's not true, because you have shows.

40:28.260 --> 40:28.900
Well, I got it.

40:28.900 --> 40:30.060
I remember what I did.

40:30.060 --> 40:33.260
Yeah, I just don't do what I did afterward.

40:33.260 --> 40:35.340
How do you get into it?

40:35.340 --> 40:35.820
Don't.

40:35.820 --> 40:38.580
I swear to God, this is going to sound like a glib, jaded thing.

40:38.580 --> 40:40.740
But I swear to God, it's my honest answer.

40:40.740 --> 40:43.300
It's not a jaded, cynical thing.

40:43.300 --> 40:47.460
Like, it's going to sound, don't have an idea.

40:47.460 --> 40:49.420
Like, like, like, like that much.

40:49.420 --> 40:50.380
Like, like, don't.

40:50.380 --> 40:51.300
Community wasn't.

40:51.300 --> 40:53.100
It's just cheers.

40:53.100 --> 40:53.860
It's just taxed.

40:53.860 --> 40:54.700
TV is not.

40:54.700 --> 40:58.140
We're not going to a sitcom to, like, have our minds blown

40:58.140 --> 41:00.940
by the concept of the sitcom.

41:00.940 --> 41:03.500
That's my best advice for TV, because I think too many people

41:03.500 --> 41:04.180
make that mistake.

41:04.180 --> 41:07.340
Science fiction, maybe, if you want to do a sci-fi drama,

41:07.340 --> 41:09.820
then maybe what's drawing people in.

41:09.820 --> 41:13.100
I haven't never written that stuff or pitched that stuff

41:13.100 --> 41:14.180
to anybody, so.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.300
But you're about to go back into the market potentially

41:16.300 --> 41:18.340
and write another half hour show, right?

41:18.340 --> 41:21.460
Yeah, I'm closing some deals.

41:21.460 --> 41:23.380
But do you have ideas, or are you going to?

41:23.380 --> 41:24.900
No, absolutely not.

41:24.900 --> 41:28.460
And I would be a bad sitcom writer if I had any ideas.

41:28.460 --> 41:32.660
My ideas start because the system is,

41:32.660 --> 41:34.540
it's got its own momentum.

41:34.540 --> 41:37.500
And the tough thing for TV writers to learn

41:37.500 --> 41:40.420
is that you want to, yeah, it's really important

41:40.420 --> 41:41.740
to be super talented.

41:41.740 --> 41:44.300
That's fantastic if you can manage that.

41:44.300 --> 41:47.500
But what you really need to do is, like,

41:47.500 --> 41:50.100
understand that everyone wants to help,

41:50.100 --> 41:52.140
and they're all getting paid a lot of money to help.

41:52.140 --> 41:55.460
So just work less and think less.

41:55.460 --> 41:59.260
You're going to be just as talented a writer

41:59.260 --> 42:02.940
whether you think a long time about what you want to write

42:02.940 --> 42:04.260
or not.

42:04.260 --> 42:08.180
What you're being paid to do is be smart on paper

42:08.180 --> 42:09.660
and the execution of a script.

42:09.660 --> 42:12.940
But they want to say, could he work at a pickle store?

42:12.940 --> 42:14.220
Just say yes.

42:14.220 --> 42:15.100
Yes.

42:15.100 --> 42:17.740
The answer is yes, he could work at a pickle store.

42:17.740 --> 42:20.420
Because then aliens can still invade the pickle store.

42:20.420 --> 42:21.980
In episode five, it doesn't matter.

42:21.980 --> 42:23.740
If you want to get fired later, you

42:23.740 --> 42:26.500
can figure out how to do it.

42:26.500 --> 42:30.780
My boss stops all over my soul furiously and regularly.

42:30.780 --> 42:33.260
Is it Maxigan?

42:33.260 --> 42:37.300
How do I get paid more for enduring that?

42:37.300 --> 42:38.620
I think this person's baiting me.

42:44.860 --> 42:47.380
I got a book on tape at an airport.

42:47.380 --> 42:50.820
Something about lion taming.

42:50.820 --> 42:55.140
A guy that tamed lions wrote a book for CEOs or something.

42:55.140 --> 42:57.020
He was writing a book, but it was all about it.

42:57.020 --> 42:58.100
I listened to it for a while.

42:58.100 --> 42:59.020
It was kind of interesting.

42:59.020 --> 43:00.780
He was talking about basically how

43:00.780 --> 43:05.500
to make assholes think that doing what you want is their idea.

43:05.500 --> 43:06.820
Because that's what a lion tamer does.

43:06.820 --> 43:10.660
Obviously, lions can rip your head off if they want to.

43:10.660 --> 43:13.860
But what lion tamers are doing is convincing the lion that,

43:13.860 --> 43:18.220
for instance, when they stand on those stupid little pedestals,

43:18.220 --> 43:20.740
the lion thinks that it's defending the pedestal.

43:20.740 --> 43:24.380
It thinks that it's pedestal and that the lion tamer really

43:24.380 --> 43:25.740
wishes it could be up there.

43:25.740 --> 43:28.100
And the lion's going like, stay away

43:28.100 --> 43:32.540
from my shitty little bongo drum that I'm standing on.

43:32.540 --> 43:35.380
And the audience is going, what a dumbass lion.

43:35.380 --> 43:38.740
The lion is really proud of itself.

43:38.740 --> 43:40.980
The answer to the question is somehow

43:40.980 --> 43:43.420
you have to trick your dipshit boss

43:43.420 --> 43:47.460
into thinking that he would be even dumber for not paying you

43:47.460 --> 43:48.220
more.

43:48.220 --> 43:49.260
I don't know how to do that.

43:49.260 --> 43:52.460
Otherwise, I would have picked a better job than I picked.

43:52.460 --> 43:54.060
I don't have any bosses.

43:54.060 --> 43:56.420
When I, as soon as I do, I got three years before,

43:56.420 --> 43:59.500
they're all over my ass and fire me.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.940
I don't want to sound like a broken record, but I got fired.

44:01.940 --> 44:05.380
What do you think?

44:05.380 --> 44:07.980
I mean, this might be beating a dead horse,

44:07.980 --> 44:11.380
but what do you think their justification is for firing you?

44:11.380 --> 44:14.820
What would they say in the, like, if you, like,

44:14.820 --> 44:15.740
Sorry, what was the question?

44:15.740 --> 44:18.460
What would they, not their press release answer,

44:18.460 --> 44:20.900
but why do you think they fired you?

44:20.900 --> 44:24.820
Oh, it's cost-benefit ratio.

44:24.820 --> 44:30.500
NBC moved the show to Friday night at 8.30,

44:30.500 --> 44:32.020
and said only 13 episodes.

44:32.020 --> 44:35.300
So that's NBC saying, you're basically almost canceled.

44:35.300 --> 44:37.340
We're just about to cancel you.

44:37.340 --> 44:39.860
So what is Sony going to do with that clock,

44:39.860 --> 44:40.980
with that shot clock?

44:40.980 --> 44:43.340
They're not going to give the ball to Psycho Pants.

44:43.340 --> 44:47.020
Like, what am I going to do with 13 episodes?

44:47.020 --> 44:51.660
It's not going to be the thing that makes NBC go, oh, shit,

44:51.660 --> 44:53.700
we had you wrong.

44:53.700 --> 44:55.060
Get this guy back at 8.00.

44:55.060 --> 44:57.420
Put him at 9.30 on Thursday.

44:57.420 --> 44:58.500
This guy's the best.

44:58.500 --> 45:01.700
If your motivation is, like, to get a show running

45:01.700 --> 45:03.900
and syndicated and as long as possible,

45:03.900 --> 45:09.620
you definitely, it's not a dumb decision to bid me adieu.

45:09.620 --> 45:13.020
That was just a boring answer.

45:13.020 --> 45:15.500
I'm just an asshole that doesn't,

45:15.500 --> 45:17.060
I don't take notes very well.

45:17.060 --> 45:19.740
I don't like, you could give me five notes

45:19.740 --> 45:21.820
that if one of them was what I was going to do already,

45:21.820 --> 45:23.780
I'll say that's a good idea.

45:23.780 --> 45:28.300
But it only fools them for three seasons.

45:28.300 --> 45:31.100
Will drugs be allowed in Harmontown?

45:31.100 --> 45:32.060
Yes, of course.

45:35.660 --> 45:39.220
Would there be some drugs that you would not allow?

45:39.220 --> 45:40.660
No, no, there can't be any.

45:40.660 --> 45:43.540
Honestly, we have a big problem in this country right now

45:43.540 --> 45:45.780
with momentum.

45:45.780 --> 45:48.940
We are all freaked out because we go, oh, shit,

45:48.940 --> 45:51.540
if you legalize this tomorrow, whether it's a certain kind

45:51.540 --> 45:54.060
of gun and we all, all this stuff makes perfect sense,

45:54.060 --> 45:56.020
but it's only given the situation that we have.

45:56.020 --> 45:57.460
That's why we have to start over.

45:57.460 --> 45:59.620
Because the truth is, hand grenades

45:59.620 --> 46:01.060
should be able to grow on trees.

46:01.060 --> 46:03.660
But we should have self-control.

46:03.660 --> 46:06.300
We can't, because what if some guy just in his garage

46:06.300 --> 46:09.980
invents tomorrow, just invents a laser wand

46:09.980 --> 46:11.260
that if you touch people with it,

46:11.260 --> 46:13.900
their body just disappears?

46:13.900 --> 46:16.860
Does that guy get to be the most successful person

46:16.860 --> 46:18.860
in the world because he invented that?

46:18.860 --> 46:21.100
Because he can't be prosecuted for his crimes.

46:21.100 --> 46:23.620
He can't be, he's just going to go up to people.

46:23.620 --> 46:25.220
You don't have any evidence to convict him.

46:25.220 --> 46:27.260
Like the mailman comes over and he goes, fuck you.

46:27.260 --> 46:28.980
I don't like your cheekbones.

46:28.980 --> 46:31.060
And he makes them disappear.

46:31.060 --> 46:33.820
Does that guy get to be president?

46:33.820 --> 46:38.260
Or is it wrong to hurt people and make them dead?

46:38.260 --> 46:39.940
It's obviously the latter.

46:39.940 --> 46:41.340
It's wrong to hurt people.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.860
We have to remember that that's really

46:43.860 --> 46:46.340
the star we're pursuing here.

46:46.340 --> 46:51.540
We can't get too hung up in how to make nobody hurt anybody.

46:51.540 --> 46:53.860
I told the story of, I never told it again,

46:53.860 --> 46:55.380
because we did record it, and I'd

46:55.380 --> 46:56.540
like to put it on the website.

46:56.540 --> 46:58.140
But it's an old classic.

46:58.140 --> 47:01.660
It's my origin story, the story of how my dad beat

47:01.660 --> 47:03.860
the living fuck out of me and my brother

47:03.860 --> 47:04.940
for playing with matches.

47:04.940 --> 47:09.340
It's really my, it's my radioactive spider.

47:09.340 --> 47:10.980
Because it explains almost everything

47:10.980 --> 47:15.580
I can think of about my me as I am.

47:15.580 --> 47:18.700
So my brother and I got caught playing with matches.

47:18.700 --> 47:21.180
My brother loves setting stuff on fire.

47:21.180 --> 47:22.860
He's fascinated with fire.

47:22.860 --> 47:24.500
And he was five years older than me.

47:24.500 --> 47:26.820
So we went out in the back bushes,

47:26.820 --> 47:29.100
and we gathered some dry leaves, and he had a book of matches.

47:29.100 --> 47:31.980
And we were lighting little piles of twigs and stuff on fire.

47:31.980 --> 47:35.540
And my mom came looking for us.

47:35.540 --> 47:37.300
And she caught us playing with matches.

47:37.300 --> 47:42.940
So for this offense, as with all major ones,

47:42.940 --> 47:45.900
the misdemeanor was always the wooden spoon.

47:45.900 --> 47:46.900
My mom could handle that.

47:46.900 --> 47:48.540
She had a big bag of wooden spoons,

47:48.540 --> 47:50.660
because they would break on your ass to hit you.

47:50.660 --> 47:52.580
You got a lot of wooden spoon people in the audience.

47:52.580 --> 47:54.100
I can hear you.

47:54.100 --> 47:55.780
I can feel you.

47:55.780 --> 48:00.260
For the felony offenses, like playing with matches, big deals.

48:00.260 --> 48:03.700
It was, wait till your father gets home.

48:03.700 --> 48:06.420
And my dad didn't get home until like 9 PM usually.

48:06.420 --> 48:07.740
He was a very hard worker.

48:07.740 --> 48:14.660
And a lot of his job seemed to involve some Southern comfort.

48:14.660 --> 48:20.380
And so he, you know, you don't mean porch swings and that.

48:20.380 --> 48:22.860
So it's wait till your dad gets home.

48:22.860 --> 48:24.420
You got caught playing with matches.

48:24.420 --> 48:29.420
I'm telling you, this is going to be really bad, says mom.

48:29.420 --> 48:31.180
My brother's freaked out.

48:31.180 --> 48:32.820
He didn't usually freak out very easily.

48:32.820 --> 48:36.940
This is a guy who once crawled out the bedroom window

48:36.940 --> 48:41.500
in his Spider-Man pajamas just to go fight crime.

48:41.500 --> 48:45.100
I admired his moxie.

48:45.100 --> 48:47.980
He didn't seem to be afraid of much.

48:47.980 --> 48:50.980
But he certainly, he knew that we were in for it.

48:50.980 --> 48:55.700
My mom took me aside and said, Daniel,

48:55.700 --> 48:57.540
you know those little stories you like to write?

48:57.540 --> 49:01.260
Because I did like to write the little things that go,

49:01.260 --> 49:05.140
Dan Harmon in the Fabulous Time Tunnel by Dan Harmon.

49:05.140 --> 49:08.980
Like just these scrawling, like, you know,

49:08.980 --> 49:11.620
just writing on typing paper and staple them together.

49:11.620 --> 49:12.860
I got, I wrote a book.

49:12.860 --> 49:16.380
Pay attention to me.

49:16.380 --> 49:19.180
Once upon a time there was a bear in the bathtub.

49:22.180 --> 49:23.900
Pulitzer, please.

49:23.900 --> 49:24.860
I'm precocious.

49:24.860 --> 49:35.740
My mom goes, I want you to write one of your stories for me

49:35.740 --> 49:38.180
while you wait for your dad to get home.

49:38.180 --> 49:40.700
I want you to write me a story about a little boy that

49:40.700 --> 49:45.620
gets caught playing with matches and regrets it.

49:45.620 --> 49:48.460
Was she that terrified for your safety?

49:48.460 --> 49:51.300
We need to mitigate the beating that's about to go on?

49:51.300 --> 49:53.380
I feel like part of her was going,

49:53.380 --> 49:55.820
let's not lose the lesson.

49:55.820 --> 49:58.740
But I think most of her was going, like,

49:58.740 --> 50:00.260
I want to fuck with you.

50:00.260 --> 50:05.380
I am basically the bad guy from Tango and Cash right now.

50:05.380 --> 50:08.220
I want to just kind of psychologically, I don't know.

50:08.220 --> 50:09.580
My mom's going to listen to this and go,

50:09.580 --> 50:11.140
that's not what I was doing.

50:11.140 --> 50:14.020
Thank you, you're so old, how do you know?

50:14.020 --> 50:15.020
How do you know what you did?

50:15.020 --> 50:16.740
What did you have for breakfast this morning, mom?

50:16.740 --> 50:18.820
As a special request, as the story continues,

50:18.820 --> 50:22.260
whenever she says anything, can you say it as Jack Pellance?

50:22.260 --> 50:24.620
I'm from Tango and Cash.

50:24.620 --> 50:28.140
I want you to write one of your stories.

50:28.140 --> 50:29.260
No, I'm not going to do that.

50:29.260 --> 50:32.860
But I want you to write it about a little boy

50:32.860 --> 50:37.860
that gets caught playing with matches and learns to regret it.

50:37.860 --> 50:43.300
So I think in my head, if I tackle this adequately,

50:43.300 --> 50:46.500
this could be my ticket.

50:46.500 --> 50:49.380
So I do, I sit down and I write, once upon a time,

50:49.380 --> 50:50.580
there's a little boy I got to play.

50:50.580 --> 50:52.900
I was like, just lose that fucking bear in the bathtub shit.

50:52.900 --> 50:55.140
This is the real deal, Harmon.

50:55.140 --> 50:57.340
No, but it's who you are, it's who you are.

50:57.340 --> 50:59.900
Write what you know.

50:59.900 --> 51:02.460
And a little boy got caught playing with matches.

51:02.460 --> 51:06.540
And then as dad came home, I just went into all this detail

51:06.540 --> 51:08.980
about whether lightning leaves in fire

51:08.980 --> 51:11.700
and they thought it was a good idea, but boy, did they not

51:11.700 --> 51:12.580
know that it wasn't.

51:12.580 --> 51:17.460
And at the end of my story, the dad comes home

51:17.460 --> 51:22.660
and he reads the story that the little boy wrote.

51:22.660 --> 51:24.180
See, you're already getting it.

51:24.180 --> 51:27.220
This is how I got fired.

51:27.220 --> 51:29.060
It's like, this is confusing.

51:29.060 --> 51:30.180
It's a story about a story.

51:33.180 --> 51:36.460
You were meta, even back then.

51:36.460 --> 51:41.180
I think just lazy, but yes, it came to be called meta.

51:41.180 --> 51:42.980
At the time, we just called it zero research.

51:42.980 --> 51:49.300
My dad, at the end of the story, the dad comes home, reads the

51:49.300 --> 51:55.180
story and realizes that the kid felt so bad for playing with

51:55.180 --> 51:58.780
matches that he didn't need his spanking.

51:58.780 --> 52:04.180
And at the end, and I gave it to my mom, and my dad still

52:04.180 --> 52:06.100
wasn't home, and my mom just read it and sighed,

52:06.100 --> 52:13.100
oh, that's what she went through, huh, this is really good.

52:13.100 --> 52:17.940
I don't buy the ending, for real.

52:17.940 --> 52:19.540
Not kidding.

52:19.540 --> 52:20.820
Third act problems.

52:20.820 --> 52:21.320
Yeah.

52:24.220 --> 52:28.260
So I'm sorry, I don't handle notes well.

52:28.260 --> 52:32.300
Sometimes it means I'm going to die inside.

52:32.300 --> 52:34.820
But she's right, you should have said, and then my father

52:34.820 --> 52:37.260
came in, and he kicked the shit out of me.

52:37.260 --> 52:38.860
And I called the police.

52:38.860 --> 52:41.580
Right.

52:41.580 --> 52:45.460
He's now serving 15 to 20 years in a minimum security

52:45.460 --> 52:46.500
prison.

52:46.500 --> 52:50.340
The neighbors came over and said, what the fuck is going on?

52:50.340 --> 52:53.060
No one else is doing this.

52:53.060 --> 52:54.340
You're insane.

52:54.340 --> 52:57.380
This is like a horror movie.

52:57.380 --> 53:00.540
My parents always said, later when everyone's parents, if

53:00.540 --> 53:02.460
there's anyone in this room that's ever had hands-on

53:02.460 --> 53:04.740
parents, you know the story, they always go,

53:04.740 --> 53:06.980
they turn into little raisins.

53:06.980 --> 53:07.860
They're fine.

53:07.860 --> 53:10.260
You play pinocchio with them, and they're like,

53:10.260 --> 53:12.020
you can never.

53:12.020 --> 53:15.420
And they always go, it was the 70s.

53:15.420 --> 53:16.420
Everyone was doing it.

53:16.420 --> 53:18.700
And they're like, I didn't name three people who were doing

53:18.700 --> 53:19.260
it.

53:19.260 --> 53:22.180
John McEnroe?

53:22.180 --> 53:23.020
Mary Lou Retton?

53:23.020 --> 53:25.700
Who was doing it in the 70s?

53:25.700 --> 53:27.060
Did you see it on a Wheaties box?

53:27.060 --> 53:29.700
What are you talking about?

53:29.700 --> 53:31.860
So yeah, then my dad came home, and the rest of the story

53:31.860 --> 53:32.980
is terrible.

53:32.980 --> 53:34.500
But I never got my spanking, actually,

53:34.500 --> 53:37.300
because my brothers were so bad that there was a medical

53:37.300 --> 53:38.580
tonsil ward.

53:38.580 --> 53:39.300
Yeah, yeah.

53:39.300 --> 53:42.380
My brother had recently had his tonsils taken out.

53:42.380 --> 53:43.740
Shit takes a fucking turn.

53:43.740 --> 53:48.340
And my dad, my dad often, I feel so bad if my parents

53:48.340 --> 53:50.060
listen to this, because they're good people.

53:50.060 --> 53:51.260
Everybody should understand that.

53:51.260 --> 53:53.580
Now that we're podcasting it, I feel like you can't.

53:53.580 --> 53:55.940
I think the statute of limitations is over.

53:55.940 --> 53:58.300
No, but not on their emotions.

53:58.300 --> 54:00.300
All right, yeah, you're probably right.

54:00.300 --> 54:01.220
Yeah, you know what?

54:01.220 --> 54:05.500
It would be like hitting my parents with a belt to talk

54:05.500 --> 54:10.860
about it would hurt them at a very vulnerable time in their

54:10.860 --> 54:12.860
lives when they can't do anything about it.

54:12.860 --> 54:14.300
How about this?

54:14.300 --> 54:18.740
Dan, why don't you tell the story?

54:18.740 --> 54:20.420
We'll record it.

54:20.420 --> 54:22.700
But before we air it, and we have the option to edit it,

54:22.700 --> 54:30.580
have your mom and dad write a letter or a story about a son

54:30.580 --> 54:33.740
who grows up to be a famous writer, has a podcast,

54:33.740 --> 54:36.700
who can fucking lampoon those cock suckers.

54:36.700 --> 54:37.900
Come on, you met my parents.

54:37.900 --> 54:38.300
You love them.

54:38.300 --> 54:39.460
They're great.

54:39.460 --> 54:40.660
Everyone's great.

54:40.660 --> 54:41.820
The whole world is great.

54:41.820 --> 54:44.860
That's how we end up in these rules who are sealed off

54:44.860 --> 54:46.740
from each other, not understanding things,

54:46.740 --> 54:47.540
acting out.

54:47.540 --> 54:50.700
My brother, my dad came home.

54:50.700 --> 54:51.380
Matches.

54:51.380 --> 54:53.660
All right, well, I know what I have to do, because my dad's

54:53.660 --> 54:55.340
dad did it, and his dad's dad did it.

54:55.340 --> 54:58.700
Never mind the fact that all these people are insane.

54:58.700 --> 55:01.220
My dad took off his belt, and he always had this catchphrase

55:01.220 --> 55:03.740
he'd say, this is going to hurt me a lot more than it's going

55:03.740 --> 55:04.260
to hurt you.

55:04.260 --> 55:09.940
But he was always so drunk he'd get it mixed up half the time.

55:09.940 --> 55:12.340
And just say the scariest thing in the world,

55:12.340 --> 55:16.860
this is going to hurt you more than it's going to hurt me.

55:16.860 --> 55:19.460
I know that.

55:19.460 --> 55:23.140
It's terrible.

55:23.140 --> 55:25.780
And that's not the way it's supposed to work.

55:25.780 --> 55:27.780
That's how cold I am.

55:27.780 --> 55:29.220
It's like if a nurse said, you're

55:29.220 --> 55:33.500
going to feel a large stabbing in your arm,

55:33.500 --> 55:36.140
and then the blood's going to get siphoned out of your body.

55:36.140 --> 55:40.660
But just think of puppies burning while I do it.

55:40.660 --> 55:43.060
Now, what kind of father do you think you would make?

55:43.060 --> 55:45.220
If you had kids, let's say you had two boys.

55:45.220 --> 55:48.020
Let's say like five years from now, or six years from now,

55:48.020 --> 55:51.140
you've got a five-year-old and a one-year-old.

55:51.140 --> 55:53.420
What kind of father do you think you're prepared to be?

55:53.420 --> 55:53.940
I don't know, man.

55:53.940 --> 55:54.780
That really scares me.

55:54.780 --> 55:56.180
My girlfriend's in the audience.

55:56.180 --> 55:58.700
I was telling a story last week of how

55:58.700 --> 56:01.100
I was working on shelving units, and Aaron was there,

56:01.100 --> 56:04.660
and I cut the shelves wrong at Home Depot.

56:04.660 --> 56:08.620
And they didn't fit for the third time back and forth.

56:08.620 --> 56:12.180
And I just, you know, I kicked shit and threw shit.

56:12.180 --> 56:16.300
Sometimes the cat, before I figured out what the cat was

56:16.300 --> 56:19.420
doing, why it was meowing, it turns out

56:19.420 --> 56:21.620
I had a toy in its mouth, and I wanted to give me the toy.

56:21.620 --> 56:23.740
But I started to like, cat would just meow constantly.

56:23.740 --> 56:27.300
And I was like, I don't know, I'd get up and chase it.

56:27.300 --> 56:29.300
I'd be like, shut the fuck up.

56:29.300 --> 56:30.340
You know, I'd get angry.

56:30.340 --> 56:34.140
Because the cat was giving you notes?

56:34.140 --> 56:36.540
Because I don't know if you've ever met a two-year-old.

56:36.540 --> 56:37.060
They give you fucking notes.

56:37.060 --> 56:39.260
They give you a lot of notes, yeah.

56:39.260 --> 56:42.540
They're not called the constructive twos.

56:42.540 --> 56:43.820
No, I'm aware of this.

56:43.820 --> 56:47.140
I've met my friend's children, and I've read all about it.

56:47.140 --> 56:49.940
And then it's only 13 years before they're adults that

56:49.940 --> 56:53.780
can really, like, Dino's daughter now, adorable little

56:53.780 --> 56:55.860
tigger, I don't know if I'm allowed to say names of people

56:55.860 --> 56:58.260
who aren't even legally allowed to defend themselves.

56:58.260 --> 57:00.180
But I'm not going to say anything bad about her.

57:00.180 --> 57:01.900
She's a little woman now.

57:01.900 --> 57:03.580
We've known her ever since she was a little kid.

57:03.580 --> 57:05.260
My friend Dino had a little daughter.

57:05.260 --> 57:09.380
And you used to just like, I remember when she liked,

57:09.380 --> 57:10.820
she loved Bananas Foster.

57:10.820 --> 57:12.540
It was a dessert that Dino would make for her.

57:12.540 --> 57:15.540
And so I would do a little character called Bananas Foster.

57:15.540 --> 57:17.540
And I'd go like, hey, I'm Bananas Foster.

57:17.540 --> 57:19.340
And I'd do a little dance, and she'd giggle.

57:19.340 --> 57:21.300
I was like a rock star.

57:21.300 --> 57:24.860
And now she's just texting, and everyone's all like,

57:24.860 --> 57:25.860
catch a cold glance.

57:25.860 --> 57:28.300
And she's like, blech.

57:28.300 --> 57:31.140
And I want to be like, fuck you.

57:31.140 --> 57:34.780
Just because I'm not good at football.

57:34.780 --> 57:36.100
There's that, too.

57:36.100 --> 57:39.620
Like, kids, you've only got 12 years before they're actually,

57:39.620 --> 57:43.900
like, when they hit puberty, they become like,

57:43.900 --> 57:45.700
now they're rolling their eyes at you,

57:45.700 --> 57:47.180
and they actually have eyes to roll.

57:47.180 --> 57:50.500
And like, using sarcasm and stuff, like, that's only 12 years

57:50.500 --> 57:53.540
after it was adorable for one year.

57:53.540 --> 57:55.660
It's like, yeah, I'm preparing.

57:55.660 --> 57:56.620
Do you want to have children?

57:56.620 --> 57:58.780
I do, really badly.

57:58.780 --> 58:04.820
But I just, I'm terrified that I'm not going to be able

58:04.820 --> 58:05.420
to handle it.

58:05.420 --> 58:07.780
Was the whimper you were, how you said that.

58:07.780 --> 58:12.460
I feel, I really do.

58:12.460 --> 58:15.180
I'm terrified I'm going to be a bad dad.

58:15.180 --> 58:18.540
And I'm also, I definitely, the solution isn't to be one

58:18.540 --> 58:22.380
of these horrible pussy dads that are all over LA.

58:22.380 --> 58:23.900
You see people walking around Target,

58:23.900 --> 58:25.420
and the kids just screaming their head off,

58:25.420 --> 58:28.260
and the people are just going like, Martin,

58:28.260 --> 58:29.700
use your indoor voice or whatever.

58:29.700 --> 58:32.820
Like, come on, shame the kid.

58:32.820 --> 58:33.740
It's public.

58:33.740 --> 58:36.420
Like, my mom only had to have one conversation with me.

58:36.420 --> 58:38.100
Like, she didn't need a wooden spoon for that.

58:38.100 --> 58:40.660
Like, I said some shit too loud in a Target,

58:40.660 --> 58:43.180
and she was like, you don't talk like that

58:43.180 --> 58:45.340
outside the house.

58:45.340 --> 58:47.980
And if she was allowed to, she would have said N-word.

58:47.980 --> 58:53.260
Like, it seemed like that was coming, didn't it?

58:53.260 --> 58:57.740
Like, she was like, back in the 70s, everybody was doing,

58:57.740 --> 58:59.140
there was only one conversation.

58:59.140 --> 59:01.540
And I was like, we don't, my mom would say it,

59:01.540 --> 59:02.460
she would say it logically.

59:02.460 --> 59:04.300
Like, I remember the logic seeping into my brain,

59:04.300 --> 59:05.700
being a movie theater.

59:05.700 --> 59:08.980
And she was like, what if everyone was talking right now?

59:08.980 --> 59:09.860
Shut up.

59:09.860 --> 59:10.460
Yeah.

59:10.460 --> 59:11.860
I go, oh yeah, she's right.

59:11.860 --> 59:13.180
She's got a point.

59:13.180 --> 59:15.100
I remember, like, I was at a friend's house,

59:15.100 --> 59:19.900
and I said something kind of rude in front of, like,

59:19.900 --> 59:21.540
the kids that I went to school with.

59:21.540 --> 59:24.020
It was like a new school if I had moved into a new neighborhood.

59:24.020 --> 59:27.940
And I said something kind of cocky or, you know,

59:27.940 --> 59:29.580
that suspend your disbelief.

59:29.580 --> 59:32.620
I was a little, I came in a little high on some kid.

59:32.620 --> 59:35.220
I probably said something kind of arrogant and shitty.

59:35.220 --> 59:38.540
And the mother, who I'd known, you know, a few months,

59:38.540 --> 59:40.860
pulled me into the kitchen and just went,

59:40.860 --> 59:42.060
whack, across my face.

59:42.060 --> 59:44.660
Just another woman slapped you, like, not your mom.

59:44.660 --> 59:48.540
Oh yeah, some woman whom I will never remember her name.

59:48.540 --> 59:49.660
She just pulled me into the kitchen.

59:49.660 --> 59:50.820
Jeffrey, can I talk to you?

59:50.820 --> 59:52.460
And I was, like, 12.

59:52.460 --> 59:55.460
And she just co-lobbered me across the face.

59:55.460 --> 59:56.780
And I was like, whoa.

59:56.780 --> 59:59.380
And she's like, you're not better than my son.

59:59.380 --> 01:00:02.380
Ooh.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:07.860
And I was like, wow, me thinks he protests too much.

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.740
So I'm fucking her.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.740
I'm fucking her.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:16.540
That's a long story short.

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:18.300
And I mean, fucking her day.

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:22.580
I am really, like, she's getting that 12-year-old vitamin

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.080
JD.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.340
Should we do a, I remember one time,

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:34.340
when I was 12, around that age, I remember this odd,

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:37.060
this actually bonded me with my mom in a way,

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.220
because I suddenly realized the cycle of abuse

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.940
that was really happening.

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.580
She told me to feed the cat.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:43.980
And I went, yeah, yeah.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:47.700
And as I said that, I opened the closet door where the cat food

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.200
was.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.540
And I bent over to grab the can of cat food.

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.260
And I felt this unexpected sharp kick in my tailbone,

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.340
like, really hard.

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.500
Like, Charlie Brown going for the football hard.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.180
Like, she just put everything into it.

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.740
But she wasn't Charlie Brown.

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.020
And my tailbone was there.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.980
And if you've ever been kicked in the tailbone,

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:10.820
and also just any kind of unexpected impact with your body,

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:15.260
I had a can of cat food in my hand, and was 12 years old.

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.340
So I'm, like, cussing.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.940
You know, I have testosterone, like,

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:21.740
starting to kind of go through my blood a little bit.

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.540
I probably had a little wispy, like, Hitler mustache

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.060
or something.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.820
I got a little prepubescent, like, little

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.180
wisp on my upper lip.

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:34.140
And I instinctively, because some mammoth or saber-toothed

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:36.340
tiger is, like, kicking me in the tailbone,

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:39.940
I wheeled around, hefting this object in my hand,

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.220
this can of cat food.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.780
And this was 80s cat food.

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.900
They used to come in big-ass cans

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.660
that you had to open with a device.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.540
They hadn't figured out how to make portion them yet.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.340
And I turned her out with this thing.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:56.540
And my mom, who had just kicked me in the tailbone,

01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:00.540
she, like, she made this sound in this face that was, like,

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:05.020
ah, like, she wilted, like, and I, and I,

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:05.940
Oh man!

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:06.440
Yeah.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:11.420
And I said, it was like, oh, I get it.

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:12.940
It's just, like, white trash, like,

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.820
larva becoming a bee, you know.

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:17.700
Like, I'm supposed to do this now.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.700
And I was like, what is your, what did you do?

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.340
And she's like, I thought you were being snotty.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.140
She just, she didn't know what she was doing.

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.380
And she knew what I was supposed to do.

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.820
And she was okay with it?

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:35.620
And I literally broke that cycle there

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.780
in the pantry that day for my sockets.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.900
I was like, Jesus Christ, no,

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.700
I'm not gonna bludgeon you to death

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.700
like Chris Penn at the end of Shortcuts.

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:47.700
And then have kids of my own

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.100
and find a nice closet to store our cat food in.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.580
I'm not gonna keep doing this.

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:53.420
All right, let's do it.

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.220
We had some success with this as a closer for last week.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.860
We got a bowl full of questions

01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:58.700
that you could do a lightning round.

01:02:58.700 --> 01:02:59.540
Speed round.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.360
Speed round.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.220
All of my answers will be five words.

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:05.060
Okay.

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:05.900
Yeah.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.740
Yeah.

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:07.580
Yeah.

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:11.180
Three word answers.

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.340
I like their attitude.

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.660
Yeah.

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:17.180
And in honor of Erin McGathy's sound board last week,

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.100
I don't have the sound board,

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.060
but just Erin, I want you to do a lightning round.

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:23.860
If you can yell it loud enough, the theme song.

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.420
Everybody, welcome to the Harmontown lightning round.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.860
Dad, dad, dad, dad.

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:29.700
Duh.

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:30.540
Duh.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.380
Duh.

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.720
Duh.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.420
If you could have sex with any mythical creature,

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:38.260
which would you pick and why?

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:42.060
Oh, you wish you had those five words now.

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:45.300
Seribus comma more mouths.

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.140
Duh.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:46.980
Duh.

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:47.800
Duh.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.640
Duh.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.480
Duh.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.320
Duh.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.140
Duh.

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:51.980
Duh.

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:52.820
Duh.

01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:53.660
Duh.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.500
Duh.

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.320
Duh.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.140
Duh.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:57.180
This is as written.

01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:58.420
I'm gonna read it as written.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.640
Would ever write a play?

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:04.240
Yes, would.

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:06.500
Lady.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.620
Are you a conspiracy theorist?

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:14.700
If so, do you have one in particular you firmly believe?

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:17.960
Well, Jews.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.800
Pfft.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.640
Pfft.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.460
Pfft.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.300
Pfft.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.140
Pfft.

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.860
It was a joke I mined getting shot in the head.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:29.500
I said, my, there'll be a gunshot later on.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.340
How can I get my producing career back on track?

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:33.180
Pfft.

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:34.020
Pfft.

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.100
I'm offended, asshole.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:38.940
Pfft.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:39.780
Pfft.

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:40.620
Oh, yeah.

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.140
Cause isn't that a, that's a bit, right?

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:44.540
It's not like Michael Bay's sitting in the back

01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.540
then really wants to know that from me.

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.020
I think, no, I think there might be somebody

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.500
who actually had a producing career.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.380
Oh, no, no, no, you're saying that they're just saying.

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:52.220
Yeah, they're kind of going.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.060
They're taking the piss at him.

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:53.900
Yeah.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.900
I haven't lost enough weight,

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.300
but I have a nice black shirt.

01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.180
Should I wear that?

01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.020
Like they're kind of like, like.

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.180
How do I get a podcast without a structure?

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:03.340
Yeah.

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.740
Yeah, should I just do it?

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.700
How do I raise 200,000 plus on Kickstarter

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.340
without an established brand?

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:11.180
Mm-hmm.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.180
Yeah, now they're coming right at you.

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:15.320
Again, dick head.

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:19.100
How many hand jobs?

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.940
Pfft.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:23.700
That's like, by the way, that was one of the questions

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.800
in the Dao De Jing.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.660
At least 20.

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.060
Fair enough.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:34.540
How do you maintain hope for humanity

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:39.140
after things like the dark night rises shooting?

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:40.540
Ooh.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.380
Oh.

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:42.580
This is Max, right?

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:43.420
That's not you?

01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:44.740
Okay.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.580
He's talking to silly.

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.260
No, no, no, let's take it serious.

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:48.260
Let's take it serious.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.340
Is that, is that a word?

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.300
No.

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:54.140
Is that, is that?

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:54.980
No.

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:55.820
That's what it was.

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:56.920
Uh, uh, no, no.

01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.260
Uh, no, no.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.100
It's a no, no.

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.500
Lassie, what are you trying to say?

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.340
You okay?

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:13.660
Take it serious.

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.700
Realize.

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:22.940
All right, painted himself into a corner.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.820
Mankind fails.

Sorry.

Got time for 10 more.

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.180

He's not lying.

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.100
This one's just blank.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.100
You want to answer that one?

So symbolic.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:01.540
Right?

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:13.300
If, uh, if I blow a guy to get a job in Hollywood,

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:20.180
