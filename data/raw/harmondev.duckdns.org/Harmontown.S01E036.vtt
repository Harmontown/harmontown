WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:28.000
Madison, Wisconsin, hello!

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
We're due west of Milwaukee, Madison, by a bunch of lakes I don't know.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:40.000 --> 00:52.000
Won't you please welcome to the stage Wisconsin's own mayor, Dan Harmon!

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
Hey Madison, Wisconsin! Thank you very, very much!

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
You are too kind, you are too numerous, you are probably too cold, and your room is too echoey.

01:08.000 --> 01:21.000
But we are going to... imagine me as just a god in a cave for this episode.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Are we out there or just for us?

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Maybe it just bounces back weird for us.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Hello? Hello?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Jeff, quick improv sketch in a cave.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Okay.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
Man, this place is dark, and I found a sandwich.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I'm Batman!

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Whoa! All right, scene over.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
It's good. As long as you can make it work for yourself.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
This is as close as we're going to get to my hometown of Milwaukee on this tour.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Brown Deer!

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Did someone just yell out, we love beer?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Brown Deer!

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Oh yeah, Brown Deer, yeah. Is that Frito?

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Wait, where's my buddy Frito? Is Frito here?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
There he is.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
My best friend from high school is here tonight, Dave Frito.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Let's get him up here. Let's bring him up.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Okay, well, he has a story to tell.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Dave, do you think you can make it up?

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Because I know part of the story involves your locomotion.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Do you think you can make it up here, Dave?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Sure.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Breakdown, Madison, Wisconsin.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Fuck your mama in the mouth and the tonsils.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I fucked your mama like my name was Dan.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
My name is Dan. Fuck you like a man.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Fuck you once. Fuck you twice.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Fuck you please. Fuck you like.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Fuck you're in the barn. Fuck you're in the hole.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Fuck you're like a pole lock.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
From Milwaukee.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Fucked her with a walkie-talkie like my name is Bruce Willis.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Die hard. Fucked your mama by the yard.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Here's a yard. It's my dick.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Here's two yards. Both of my dicks.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Fifty yards. Whole thing's my dick.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
I got a football dick. Go Packers, go!

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
That wasn't bad, Jeff.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
That wasn't a bad rap.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
We're off to a good start.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
It wasn't a good one.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Unlike most of my raps, that was not bad.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
I like that you fucked her fleas and her lice.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Yeah, you can see where I think of the rhyme.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
What's another thing like lice?

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Dave Friedel, everybody.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Dave Friedel, my best friend.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
I met Dave when I was 15, 14 years old.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
I just transferred into Brown Deer High School

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
in Brown Deer, Wisconsin, from Marshall High School,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
just 4,000 students.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
And then I transferred into this 600 students

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
like suburban high school.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Not the coolest entrance.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I wore a few fell pants.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
I did own an Inspector Gadget raincoat,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
which I did wear frequently and blah, blah, blah.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Not the coolest guy coming out of school.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Dave was the first guy who befriended me

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
because he saw my Dungeons & Dragons t-shirt.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah, it was something along those lines.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It was one of those ones that were just in homeroom.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
I think the D&D and the connection was made

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
real early on that freshman year.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I can't remember if it was you approached me first

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
or I approached you or whatever it was,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
but I remember it was you coming up to me

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
and going, hey, you role-played?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
You saw my Dungeons & Dragons shirt,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
and I said, yeah, you used a computer?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
It was easy to be a nerd back then.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
There was one way to be a nerd back then.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
If you had a computer, if you knew what one was

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
or how to turn it on, instead of a typewriter,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
you were a nerd.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
There were TV shows about how people would use computers

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
to make the refrigerator open

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
or make the world go to war with itself

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
because computers were magical and for nerds alone.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
You told me about the Citizen's Band emulator,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
which was this 300-baud chatroom,

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
which is where I met the girl I lost my virginity to.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
The LA podcast episode where I'm reading from my journals,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
and I'm talking about the girl that I...

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Sam Pollution.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Yes, the girl that I...

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
The condom froze to the...

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah, and I had such good sex with

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
that she went to a mental hospital.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
That was a...

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I was a Stan Lee needs to come in the bottom and go,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
webhands will remember Dan fucking a girl mental

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
from issue number 128.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
So you fucked your brains out is what you're saying.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Well, that's how we choose to interpret it,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
not that I sent her into a lifelong depression

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
with my adolescent Ruddings.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
The...

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
What my point is, Friedel is a linchpin.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
He's a galactic nexus.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
We're so close to my hometown, Friedel came out here,

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
and I want to talk about your toe.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Oh, man. Of course.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
So some woman made a theme song out there.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
Oh, Friedel's toe.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
I think Peter Gabriel is here tonight.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
Friedel, Friedel's toe, Friedel's toe.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I think that pearls him.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
There's a Friedel's toe.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Cos he can't walk around.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
There's a George Michael version that's real popular, I think.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
You got a blister on your toe.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah, a blister.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Story does not end there.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
No, no, it doesn't end there.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
The blister got a little out of control,

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
and I thought I'd taken care of it,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
and cleaned it up and was doing the proper care to it,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
but maybe I quit the antibiotics a little too early

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
or something along those lines.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
And so by mid-December,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
when I started to notice the toes smelling like cheese,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
I thought that there was...

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Toasteries are not going to make you feel warm and cuddly.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
It's not date night.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
We're from Wisconsin here, so it's sort of a...

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah, it's a familiar smell or something.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
When cottage cheese goes bad, so...

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah, so the toe started to go bad.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
What's your toe on which foot?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
It's the right.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
The right big toe.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
So your big toe on your right foot?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah, it's a month removed.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
It's been gone?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah, it's gone.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Now, how does that affect your ability to stand up?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
But does it need big toes?

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
It seems to be doing pretty good in getting around.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
So it turns out we don't...

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
The balance is all right.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
We don't need our big toe for anything, do we?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I've been told, like, yeah,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
unless I want to put basketball, you know what I mean?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
What do they do with their big toe?

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I may have some calisthenics or jumping problems, but...

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
But here's the creepy thing about the whole thing.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Can we see it?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Can you take it off?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
It's all bandaged up.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
It's all bandaged up.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Here's the weird thing, okay?

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
And I'm going to approach the weirdness in stages.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Our dungeon master, Spencer, has two toes fused together,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
so he's technically also missing a toe.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
David Friedel was my first dungeon and dragons buddy in high school.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
David Friedel, his name is Germanic, Friedel,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
but what did we call you?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Freedom.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Free toe.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Free toe.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Like the corn chip.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
He is now free of a toe, like Spencer.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Who has two toes fused together?

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Less impressive to Spencer's audience than I am.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Let's get started.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
You're saying the string of meaningless quits and it says...

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I'm saying...

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Let's bring Spencer out right now.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Alright, let's bring Spencer out.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
I want him to be free toe.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Spencer, this is my buddy, David Friedel.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
This is my first Spencer.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
We didn't really dungeon master, but we played D&D together, right?

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Yeah, we did D&D together, but it was Shatter Ones.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
That was the game that I ran later on.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
You GM'd a little, right?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah, that was the game that I GM'd.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
I mean, the Dungeons and Dragons sketch that you wrote for the Alewise,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I remember you ran that session,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
and that was one of the first sessions

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
when the three or four of us all got together to start playing.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
It was real early on freshman year,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
and, you know, almost...

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
I don't want to say verbatim that you took that set from that session,

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
but there's a lot of stuff that I remember that came out.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah, that was a great thing.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
How do you think Spencer's been doing?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Oh, he's great.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Excellent.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
I spent the last couple of days really kind of catching up on the podcast tour

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
and things like that,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
and even this afternoon with my wife,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
we were listening to the Turtle Panties episode,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
where you sort of, in my opinion,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I think you were setting up the tour very, very well,

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
so I'm just fascinated.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I'm two or three podcasts behind,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
but I really can't wait to hear what's kind of been going on

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
and get caught up.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Thanks, man. That's awesome.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Dave, what was your character in D&D?

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
I couldn't remember.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
I mean, Ars Magica was one of the other...

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Ars Magica.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, that was where Maxwell art fell.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I forgot the name of that.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah, that was where Maxwell art fell character was Ars.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I can't remember my character name,

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
because they were always pretty dumb.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Dave was my first friend in high school,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
and he's my first drinking buddy, too.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
We used to get drunk.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
We would raid the parents' booze cabinets,

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
and we would mix tequila with Mountain Dew,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
and apple juice, and anything else.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Anything we could get our hands on.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
And I can't drink gin to this day,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
because we had one bottle of gin,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
and that's all we had, and I drank so much,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
but I puked, and anything with gin in it

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
will now make me puke.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Not important.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I mean, you guys are the people that don't give a shit

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
about your toe nexus.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
So at this point, I mean,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
pearls before swine, frankly.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
I'll just tell you what I had for breakfast in the morning.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
Your toe was cut off right at the base of the toe, or where?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah, it's kind of at an angle.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I mean, I...

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I could take the shoe off, but not...

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Take it off. Take the shoe off.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I didn't know.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
I think we owe it to the audience to see

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
what the hell's going on here.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
All right, well, he does that.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
Spencer, I'm being attacked by an orthopedic surgeon.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Rushing at you with his bone saw,

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
the orthopedic surgeon has eyes only for your foots.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
He dives directly at you, sore drawn,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
bloodless, raging in his eyes.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Foot.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
That's all.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
That was...

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
Smooth jazz DM fusion.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Not the track I would have chosen.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I hit the wrong track.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Speaking of...

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Something terrible is going on here.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Oh, shit.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Oh, fuck. That is a man without a...

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Yeah, so that's it.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Wait, so how recent was this?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
This...

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
I lost... they annotated the toe on Christmas Eve morning.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
So, yeah, like I said, 30 days...

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
But that's good luck, right?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah, I don't...

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I think that's...

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
So you didn't bring me shit. He took my toe.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
They didn't cut the whole toe off. They cut it off in a diagonal.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah, they kind of got it in a diagonal.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
So you have that last phalange there?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Yeah, and I still have the...

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Metatarsal. Sorry, Jesus Christ.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I don't think it's the same lady.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
It's just from the darkness.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
It would be weird if she was like...

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
It's still a phalange, isn't it?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Phalanges are here.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
What's at stake, sir?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Come on, dude, what?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Finish your thought.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Come on, dude, get your toe shit together.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
You're going to get late tonight.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I have a girlfriend.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I...

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I'm skipping town tonight.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Like a thief in the night.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
I want you to get your money's worth, but...

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Aren't they still called phalanges in your toes now?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
They are.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Metacarpals and metatarsals in your foot.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
The end are still called phalanges, right?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
There's the carpals and the metacarpals

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
and the tarsals and the metatarsals,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
and I think those are all phalanges.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah, so fuck off whoever you are.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
Crazy drunk foot doctor lady.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
No more my ties for her.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
And foot books.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
She's drunk on knowledge.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
She's abusing it.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
So, Dave, you had a blister that went bad,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
and now part of your toe is gone.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
That's fucked up.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
It's a cautionary tale, if ever there was one.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Take your blisters seriously, people.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
What did you do wrong?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
What can you tell these poor kids?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
If you could go back in time...

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And donate sweets, if you're diabetic,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
take your insulin and stuff like that.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
That's the other component of it as well.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I wanted to be the same lady the whole time.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I'm like, oh, diabetes!

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
What expertise?

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
Do you see your diabetes in Wisconsin?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Wait, what did you say about diabetes in Wisconsin?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
We're going to cure it in Wisconsin.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
We're going to cure it in Wisconsin?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Oh, we'd cure it.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Okay, well, yeah.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I hope so.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Is that a diabetes thing?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I mean, that was...

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
To say that that wasn't a contributing factor,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I mean, because I do have diabetes.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Yeah, that would...

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Okay, so it's not that you ate a bunch of Twinkies

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
and got a blister in your toe came off.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
It wasn't that simple, but...

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Yeah.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
It's the combined whatever actions

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
of having the disease...

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Oh, I see.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
You had an infection that went awry.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
But it is an infection that, yes, went to the very awry.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
So what could you have done differently?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I think the thing was...

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Well, the thing that I think...

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Well, I mean, I don't know other than perhaps

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
to have seen the doctor more often.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Got in the state on the antibiotics,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
with the blogger, things like that.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Oh, I see.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I just want to know if that guy said...

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
He's not going to leave him alone or leave it alone.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Was that your advice about a blister?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Leave it alone!

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Like, he picked at it until his toe came off.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Stop picking at it.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
I have one last thing to ask about diabetes.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Dave, is it true

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
of what I heard

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
that it can be cured

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
with a rap

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
about diabetes?

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Yes!

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
No toe.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
What a brother knows.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Hey, too many Twinkies lost my toe.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Going down low.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Free toe. Free toe.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Got to lose his toe.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Went to the doctor the other day.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Said, what am I going to do?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Put it up on the table.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
You're going to be in a toless table.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
If you don't...

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Follow my directions.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Fuck your mama with my erections.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Madison, Madison, Madison.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Madison, Madison, Madison.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Madison, Madison, Madison.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Madison, Madison, Madison.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Capital building!

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Man town, USA.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
She thought I was gay.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
How could you be that attentive to women

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
without knowing just part of it yourself?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
That's what she meant.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
She wasn't homophobic.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
No way.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
She was an advocate.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
And we spent a long summer together.

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
And I fucked her a lot.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Is it the weirdest audience

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
that we've ever had, Jeff?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
In terms of their relationship with us?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
It's the audio here.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
It's the distance between us and the darkness.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
It's a cavern.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
You guys are like dark crystal muppets.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
We can only see shapes.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
And in here...

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Ideally, you would all be up on stage surrounding us.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
We would all be like...

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I'm still trying to figure out

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
what makes you angry and what makes you clap.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
There's a sense of outrage

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
when I...

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
What's that, sir?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Can we talk about it?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Yes, we can talk about it.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Otherwise, there's no show.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Are you saying, sir,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
that you'd like to talk about it?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
What's your name, sir?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Ethan.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Can you scream a little up here, Ethan?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
If you're young and spry,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
you can do it this way, yeah.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
All right, Ethan.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Hey, Dan Orman.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Can I sit down?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Yeah, yeah, sit down.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Thank you.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
No, stand up like a gentleman.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
All right.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Jeff Davis,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I earned Dave Freeland's status

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
where you can just sit down.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
You have to cut off your psyche's toe

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
before you get a chair.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Jeff Davis, I would follow you to the gates of hell.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Is that right?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I knew you before I knew Dan Orman.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Well, God bless you.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
What's your name again? Ethan.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Ethan, Ethan.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Will you sing a country song for us?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Which one?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
This one.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Take it, Ethan.

20:26.000 --> 20:32.000
I've never been to Texas.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
I don't know what they think.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
Maybe it was fun in Austin.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
But why are you avoiding Milwaukee?

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
All right.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Pretty good.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
That's not bad. Not bad.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Here's why. Are you from Milwaukee?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
No, I'm from Chicago.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I couldn't get tickets,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
so we drove here

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
and I love you so much.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
You should have called me.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
I tried to Twitter you, but it didn't work.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
It's routing.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
It's just routing.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
It's nothing personal between me and Milwaukee.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
All the way, I was beaten there.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
You were beaten there?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Most people do get beaten in their hometowns.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Who's in Milwaukee tonight?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Who's in Milwaukee tonight that you can be there?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Who beat you to Milwaukee?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I don't understand what you're saying.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
He was beaten in a child.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
He wasn't beaten there in a can of child abuse.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Child abuse.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Schneider was in Milwaukee.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
His parents could be there.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I was beaten there by Bob Goldsway.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
We're on the world's least viewing reality show.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I'm so sorry. I wasn't beaten.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I was just abandoned.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I want to...

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Can we hug it eventually, like, later, like, after the show?

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
The dance is something I've never seen on the podcast,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
and it kind of blows my mind a little bit.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Do you want to touch me?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
A little bit, yeah.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
All right.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
So you're from Chicago.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
What's your biggest fantasy, Ethan?

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Like, I don't know, like, what do you want?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
My biggest fantasy would be to have, like,

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
three dudes, like, animate anything I told them to animate.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
And, dude, no, no, no.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
My biggest fantasy would be to have

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
Justin Woodward be my partner in the series.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Ethan, do they have to be dudes?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
That's a good question.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
It's part of your fantasy that only dudes animate your fantasies.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Ooh.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
I think the animation part is the necessary part.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
No, no, no, no.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
I think that's really important. Dudes.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Dudes. They got wieners.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
They're not Mexican.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
They're not going to say that word.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Okay.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
Fucked up, went down a dark road.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
Whoever it is, or if there's anyone of any version

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
of Latin origin here, you come upstage and...

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Any Latinos here?

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Okay. The toe expert lady.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Are you okay with being white?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
What's up?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Are you okay with being white?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Am I okay being white?

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Well, I...

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Membership has its privileges.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
You get a bigger car. You get a longer driveway.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
You get to talk, and not just in the driveway.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
You get to golf, and you get to eat mayo.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I love being white.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Yeah, yeah, oh.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I don't know.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
It's...

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
It's burdensome.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
It's burdensome.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
It's got to be the hardest race to be, right?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Because of all the guilt.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
Well, I've listened to, like, every one of your shows,

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
and lately, even, it seems like you've been really...

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
You've been talking about it a lot.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I'm working on a lot of my issues on the road.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Like, there's some themes developing.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Race is...

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I mean, race has always been a theme of the show,

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
but we're getting more specific.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Like, I brought all the black people in the audience

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
on the stage.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah, yeah, that was weird.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And then I started rapping about fucking, like, government.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
And here's another thing that happened.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
It hasn't aired yet in Chicago.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
We started rapping at the end of the show,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
and then it turned into, like, this weird,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
low-stakes American Idol thing where

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
people started coming up, and they wanted to rap,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
and people would boo them or not,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
and then they would get off and set this line for it.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
And then this guy that wasn't really a Harmontown fan,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I think he had been dragged away by his friends,

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
kind of a...

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
A stout?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Yeah, his name was Khalil.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
He closes the show, a spoiler, but he's like...

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
His demeanor is very, like, giggly offstage,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
but he came up with, like, this kind of, I would say,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
ice-cubish kind of, like, register,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
and he laid it out,

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
and he used the N-word with grace and...

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Yeah, and I had a fucking spasm.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Because I don't want to ever have...

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I don't want to ever say it,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
but I love it.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
And I do have some kind of strange...

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Like, I got something to work out with black people.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I don't know what it is.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Should we bring all the Latinos up on stage right now?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
I don't have anything to do with that.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Okay, why that, though?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Why are you bringing Latinos up on stage?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
That's kind of weird.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Why not?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Well, yeah, it seems racist to think that's weird.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
Why is it still weird?

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Well, all the Latinos are going on stage right now, please.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
All the Latinos are on stage.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Okay, if you were vaguely laughing...

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Okay, we got two takers.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Ethan out!

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Thank you, Ethan.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Thank you, Ethan. That was cool.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
All right, Ethan did one of the cool Armageddon moves.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
He just missed himself.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
We like that.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
I say give Ethan a t-shirt if we can handle it.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
All right, we gotta hug the...

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
This has five Latinos.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
What's your names?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Dave.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Dave?

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Dan.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Dan?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
I know I look white.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
Hey, listen, oh my god.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Sarah, but I'm only half.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Sarah half, okay.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Liana.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Did you say...

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Liana.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Oh, Liana.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Liana.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
All right.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
So, what did you hear at the city?

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
Well, I'm Hispanic and like one-sixteenth Apache, so...

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Nice.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Me too, me too.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
I just realized this is as close as we'll ever get.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Okay, two people in the audience are gonna get this.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
This is as close as we'll ever get to having,

26:39.000 --> 26:45.000
being able to recreate the animated Rubik's Cube cartoon from the 80s.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
There was a Rubik's Cube cartoon.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
It's called Rubik the Amazing Cube.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
And for some cool reason, I don't know that it was...

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
They made it, it was like a Hispanic family.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
Rubik wasn't...

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
He was like an ET kind of figure that could turn into anything Rubik colored.

27:10.000 --> 27:16.000
And in every episode, he'd fall off a shelf and get scrambled.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
So that's when he loses his powers, you have to solve him.

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
But the kids that traveled with him, they were brothers and sisters.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
They were all...

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
I don't know if they were Mexican or what the...

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
They spoke with accents.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
The actors they hired had accents and they...

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
I remember being a kid and going, this is weird.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
But I had no problem with it.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Maybe it's because Minuto was big.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
And they were like, let's be like, let's make it, let's cash in on this Minuto thing.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
The way everything was Australian when Crocodile Dundee came out.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
They were just ahead of their time though.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
There's definitely going to be a majority in the United States in like, what, 50 years or something like that?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Tomorrow?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Yeah, that really is what it is.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
But then, you know, have fun with the Chinese.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Take...

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
All the Chinese people come to the stage right now.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Every Chinese person has to come to the stage.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
No, but you have to be a citizen of China.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
You can't just be some awesome Chinese dude.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
I want it like a national up here.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
So Dan, we have five Latinos up on stage.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
It wasn't really my call.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
I mean, I'm saying maybe sing a song or...

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Samba!

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Samba.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Isn't that racist though?

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
There's a fine line between irony and...

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
Everyone that's yelling stuff out right now, you're all crossing a weird line.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
Make them do this! Make them do that!

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
At least learn their names or something.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
Well, here's the same thing to do.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Shut up for a second.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Then you won't cross any lines.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
I don't want to make them dance or sing.

29:09.000 --> 29:17.000
But I think they should do a scene about drug safety.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
About drug safety?

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Yeah.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Okay, you guys are my family.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
I'm your youngest child.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
I'm 15.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
You're my mom.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
You're my dad.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
You're my little brother.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
And you said you were...

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
You said I'm only half or something like that?

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
Okay, you play our white housekeeper.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
My name is Ramon.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Ramon, okay.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
I'm your mom.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
I know you do to moms.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
I'm your mom.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
I know you do to moms.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
But not my mom.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
You're safe.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
You're the only one that's safe.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Mom, dad, I'm home.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I'm Ramon.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Ramon, we love you.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
I'm a vaguely Italian.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
He's better than Tina.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
I'm going to go to my room, okay?

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I just want my privacy.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
I won't be down for dinner.

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
I've never seen a kid in my life like that.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
He must have been pretty drunk at the conception.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
Oh, I've smoked up so much weed.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Oh, I'm Ramon.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I hate to tell you this.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
That's just okay to tell you.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I was cleaning his room.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
I'm done.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
I noticed there was some stuff

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
in his underwear drawer.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
Youngest son, what do you know about this?

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
Well, considering that we share a bunk bed,

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
we shoot up like five times a week.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Well, I'm actually not high anymore.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
29 is getting down.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Actually, I'm kind of hungry.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
I'll go down for dinner.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Actually, I am kind of hungry.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
I'm down for dinner.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
All right, fantastic.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
What are we getting?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Beans and rice, something like that?

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
No taco in the chiladas as usual.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
I get high, okay?

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
I get high.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
I mean, why shouldn't I?

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Right?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
It's a white man's country.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
I mean, what did it mean to them?

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
We're nothing.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Nothing!

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Have you seen that cartoon about the Rubik's Cube?

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
You know, I mean, we've come a long way.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
No, what do you mean?

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Well, there it is on the TV.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
What is that cube?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Multiple colors.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
I get it.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
I get it.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
I bet white people won't get it, but I do.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
It's diversity.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
It's the Rubik's Cube.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
I get it.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
It's the wave of the future.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
But why, when you solve the cube,

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
do you do it by separating all the colors into sections?

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
30 years later, I am remote.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
I am a violent separatist.

32:13.000 --> 32:18.000
I have taken over the world.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
Oh, I got shot in the head.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
It wasn't fatal, but oh, my parents, my family,

32:26.000 --> 32:31.000
my white housekeeper.

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
I'm sorry I turned my back on you for 30 years.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
I shouldn't have gotten high.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
Porque!

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Thank you, Latinos.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
All right, there are Latinos.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Our Latino audience, everybody.

32:51.000 --> 32:58.000
Thank you so much.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Make them dance.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Make them sing.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
You guys don't know how to approach these things delicately.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
I live in Los Angeles.

33:07.000 --> 33:13.000
Those are basically my people.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
I can't step too far forward or it rings out.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.000
Jeff, this is your last show with us for a couple of shows.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
I leave Harmontown for the next two shows.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
I'll see if I can scramble to find somebody to fill in for you.

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
Is there any requests you have?

33:36.000 --> 33:42.000
I would like to see more Jerry McSeinfeld.

33:42.000 --> 33:50.000
Dan unleashed a new character where he's the Irish version of Jerry Seinfeld.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
We were in Chicago, I think.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
No, no, no. We were in Bloomington.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
Jerry McSeinfeld.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
Can I get somebody in the audience?

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
What's a pet peeve?

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Jerks.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Jerks, okay.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Talking on phones in line.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Talking on phones in line.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Talking on phones.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Somebody in line in front of you talking on a phone.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
This is Irish Jerry Seinfeld, Jerry McSeinfeld.

34:21.000 --> 34:27.000
Good evening!

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Hi, hi!

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
I would have gotten here sooner.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
But I have to wait in line.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
There was a guy in front of me.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
He kept doing one of these. You ever see one of these?

34:40.000 --> 34:45.000
This guy, this guy holding my hand up like a phone.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
Who's he talking to?

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Well, how's that conversation going?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Oh, I'm in line.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Hey, everyone's in line.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
I'm not telling the world about it.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
You want to call somebody?

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
Use a phone booth.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Thank you, Dan.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
What's up with all these phones?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
When did phones become so important?

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
In my day, you didn't have to have a phone all the time.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Now they're everywhere.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
I guess that's just technology.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
Something in the news.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
The Taliban.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
Why do they call them the Taliban?

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
This sounds so playful.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
The Taliban are coming over.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
That sounds fun, don't it?

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
Call them the Skullfuckers or something.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
Call them the booger-eaters.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
At least intimidate them a little bit.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Call you the booger-eaters.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
Then I won't blow so many things up.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
I observe these things with my Irish perspective.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I share them.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
If you agree, then you like it.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
If you don't, then I scratch it off my set list.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.000
What's something that really gets your goat?

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
To drive to work.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
To drive to work?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I get you dead.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
That expression, get me goat.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
How do you get someone's goat?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I don't want your goat.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Can't you hold it down?

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Why do you hold something up?

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
Why can't you hold it down?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
He's a little drunken.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
He's a hot hot hot hot hot bull.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
That's just a few things I've been observing.

36:35.000 --> 36:40.000
I want a Jerry McSeinfeld rap.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
About whatever's in your mind.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Alright.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
Bring it down.

36:48.000 --> 36:54.000
Yo, yo, I'm Jerry McSeinfeld, I'm here to say a few things I observed in a casual way.

36:54.000 --> 37:00.000
If they resonate with you, I'd like you to laugh or applaud, and if you don't, what's up with giraffes?

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
Why are their necks so long? Why can't they eat smaller trees all along?

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
Oh, I went to the zoo. What's a cordon nut? It's not a nut!

37:08.000 --> 37:14.000
Oh, please!

37:20.000 --> 37:28.000
We gotta do a thing. I'm gonna go at a breakneck pace now and do some confusingly elaborate shit really fast.

37:28.000 --> 37:40.000
My hero and mentor who taught me not only improv but in comedy sports, how to be a cool, good person and have respect for the audience.

37:40.000 --> 37:50.000
His son was in Pittsburgh and freaked me out, and then he told his dad that I was coming to Madison and he came here.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
Bob Orvis, can you come up to the stage?

37:53.000 --> 38:00.000
Bob Orvis.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
Whoa, he bolted.

38:05.000 --> 38:12.000
There he is. Bob Orvis.

38:12.000 --> 38:23.000
And Morgan Grobe, our tour manager, you need to come up here because I'm gonna use him for something.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
We'll do it as quickly as possible because I have to do it. Where's Morgan?

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
Morgan Grobe, everybody.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
Morgan's the brains on the road. He keeps us on schedule.

38:32.000 --> 38:45.000
Okay, we're gonna play Story because that was the first game I ever learned from Bob and it was the first time anyone ever respected me as an adult and said, hey, you're good at Story and I'm not good at it, but Jeff, you're gonna play it too.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
And I feel like Spencer would be kind of good at this.

38:50.000 --> 39:01.000
And the interesting thing is when Dan was playing Story, he is right after he had his ass kicked in Milwaukee and his eyes were so swollen that he could only look up the bottom of his eyes.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
So getting his ass kicked was a true story.

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
And it wasn't Hispanic people that did it.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
You know what? It was Black people.

39:14.000 --> 39:23.000
Maybe that's what it was. Maybe I got this ass beating and it was like, why did they hate me? What can I do for them?

39:23.000 --> 39:29.000
I don't know. I gotta work it out. I've got ten cities left or something. I'll figure out what my deal is with Ray's.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Explain the game for them.

39:31.000 --> 39:39.000
Well, it's pretty simple. You tell a story. Whoever he points to, it tells a story until he points at someone else. It's like basic improv game.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Hey, is there room for MacGaffies to have a mic?

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
Can we have one of the mics?

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
We only have four mics.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
All right. Eric MacGaffy, I'm ready.

39:51.000 --> 39:57.000
We can share our mics. Save Spencer until Spencer can observe how it works. I think he'll be okay with it.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
Okay. All right. Let's start. We need the title.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
A title of the story.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Dan Harmon's Excellent Adventure.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Dan Harmon's Excellent Adventure.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Dan Harmon's Excellent Adventure.

40:08.000 --> 40:16.000
Okay. Fine. A little meta, but maybe it'll be a critical hit.

40:16.000 --> 40:25.000
Thank you. My jokes agent, ladies and gentlemen.

40:25.000 --> 40:31.000
It was a cold and windy night. Dan Harmon had just stopped fucking the lights off my mother.

40:31.000 --> 40:43.000
When a thought occurred to him, what if I took a jar of peanut butter and wore it as a hat and became the mayor of Madison, Wisconsin?

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
With that work?

40:45.000 --> 40:54.000
He said to himself as he peeled sweaty socks off of his hands. It had been a long time since he peeled sweaty socks off of anything.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
If you know what I mean.

40:57.000 --> 41:05.000
But we didn't know what he meant, so he demonstrated how he'd peel those hot, sweaty socks.

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
Inch by inch. Inch by inch.

41:10.000 --> 41:18.000
The painstakingly he pulled off the sock, peeling slowly off his sweat-stained skin.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
The man decided to throw him against...

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
the fire, which had been firing in the corner.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
For centuries.

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
Dan burst into the yard with a gun.

41:34.000 --> 41:39.000
It was a small gun. It was a harmless gun, because that's Dan Harmon.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Belief, nonetheless.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
Nine rounds to kill nine people.

41:44.000 --> 41:50.000
He was going to rob nine people of their souls by shooting them.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
I don't need to over-explain this, do I? I mean, it's murder. It's been around forever.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
I'm sorry, I tried to make it fancy.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
Dan walked into the yard with the gun and saw in the...

42:03.000 --> 42:09.000
Corner of the yard, a small flower. It changed his mind for a moment.

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000
And then his mind changed back to murder.

42:14.000 --> 42:21.000
He went somewhere absolutely... unusual.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
He decided he wasn't going to rip that flower apart.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
He was just not going to water it.

42:26.000 --> 42:34.000
He just watched it sit and die.

42:34.000 --> 42:40.000
Went the days as they flew off the calendar.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
Finally, the flower died.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
And he thought to himself, murder's a strange thing.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
Why did I walk out here with a gun?

42:51.000 --> 42:58.000
And then he remembered why and shot his next door neighbor, who was a man by the name of Fred.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
Fred has been a gardener for about 14 years.

43:02.000 --> 43:15.000
Dan had stoned that gardener, that sexy little gardener, with his long shears and his flirtatious eyes,

43:15.000 --> 43:21.000
full of little heart shapes.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
Woo! Woo!

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
The police pulled up at Dan's apartment.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
Oh, what's all this then, said Officer McSeinfeld?

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
I couldn't have but noticed that your front yard is a...

43:38.000 --> 43:43.000
A guest with dead people? What's with dead people?

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
I just think it's a strange thing to have one's yard.

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
I mean, I'm no decorator, but I think I have a high-pitched voice.

43:51.000 --> 43:57.000
Because I am Irish Seinfeld. What's the deal with blood on your shoes?

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
Why do they come to yards where they're foot?

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
I mean, they're arranged in feet.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Right?

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
Hey, why are we all sucking helium? We were asking each other.

44:11.000 --> 44:21.000
Suddenly, Dan turned to the side, and he saw Fredo's toe creeping toward him.

44:21.000 --> 44:28.000
It menaced slowly in the side yard of the shade as it revealed itself.

44:28.000 --> 44:35.000
Hi, Dan. Would you like a piece of cake?

44:35.000 --> 44:40.000
Fredo's toe...

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
Make it flow like...

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Yeah!

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
For all the children!

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
When Dan's gun...

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
He shot Irish Seinfeld.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
Oh, why do they call it getting shot?

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
Said Irish Seinfeld.

45:02.000 --> 45:07.000
Why don't they call it getting bulleted?

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Bob Armist, everybody!

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Bob Armist!

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
I love you, Bob. Thank you.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
He taught you well.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
I did it. We did it.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
I used to do that for a living.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
Now I do this, not for a living.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
I don't know how much of it makes any sense.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Dan, you know what time it is?

45:34.000 --> 45:40.000
It's D&D time.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Spencer, if you would.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Release the character sheets.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Erin McGathy, back to the stage.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
I lost my vodka cup.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Oh, it's behind you.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Okay, thank you, sir. Thank you.

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
Finally, someone in the audience yells out something practical.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
With the location of my booze.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
I'm sorry. That was abusive.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
You know what it is?

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
It's like, you leave the Midwest, you come back,

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
and you start acting like a dick.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
Is there any way your shoes untied?

46:08.000 --> 46:13.000
Someone just told me my shoes untied.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
And when someone tells me my shoes untied,

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
I go berserk.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
Yes, I know it's untied.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Oh, thank you.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
All right, Spencer, if you would,

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
bring us up to date in our campaign.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
Last time on Dragon Ball Z.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Okay, okay.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Our hero is trapped.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
Stay up there, Fredo.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Our heroes, trapped deep within the bowels

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
of the mythical Infinifish,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
discover a master swordsman.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
After some prodding,

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Vala sent the swordsman

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
decided to journey deeper with the party.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
They headed fish west to a passage

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
covered in acid-filled trenches.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Using tender floating discs

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
across the passage,

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
they launched themselves through a meat curtain.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
There, they saw a mysterious ice dock.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Using multiple abilities,

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
the creature charmed quark.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
But after a fearsome nail-biting action sequence,

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
the eye was destroyed.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
The group looked on to the three ways ahead

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
before deciding which way to proceed.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
So do you guys remember you just killed that eye thing?

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
There's three different paths.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
Right.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
Yeah, there's three blue portals, right?

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Yeah, they're like holes in the wall.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Are they labeled at all?

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
They are not labeled.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
As a ranger,

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
do we have any sense for the right direction?

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
You have a pretty good sense of direction,

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
but most of that is reliant on weather

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
and or local flora and fauna

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
and not the other portals of a beast.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Gentlemen, I'm pretty confident

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
it's like door on the far right.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
All right.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
Or power of elimination.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
I detect magic on all three of these orifices.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Neither of them are magical.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
None of them are magical.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
All right.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
Being a barbarian known for my whimsy,

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
I walk up to the center portal

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
and I approach it and examine it.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
It looks the same as the other two.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
How big is it?

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
What's up?

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
How large is this portal?

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
I'd place it at about two and a half feet wide.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
I put a finger in it.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Nothing happens.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
Okay.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
I ask the far left door if I say,

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
if I ask the right door,

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
if I should take the middle door,

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
will it tell me yes?

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
It gives a fever, it's feeble to the shuttle.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Dance, magic dance.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Vellison pipes up.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
What are you guys doing?

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
Stick.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Oh, I like it.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
We're doing bits.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
We thought we were going to talk about swords.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
Hey, Vellison, nice sword you got there.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Hey, man, thanks.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Where'd you get that sword?

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
It was forged in the fire of several thousand fire elementals.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
No shit?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
No, it wasn't.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I have an emerald dagger.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Do you like daggers or just swords?

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
They're like the baby sword.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Have you seen my flaming sword?

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
It's pretty wild.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
I've seen it.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
Can you make it strike far away?

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
Not yet, but can you teach me how to do that?

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Well, as it happens, I can.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
But it involves harnessing your rage.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
I harness my rage to learn how to do something.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
If it were that easy, you don't know.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
I'm an angry student.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Well, let's see.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Swing your sword.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
I swing my sword.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Nice.

49:54.000 --> 49:59.000
Your foot, your footings a bit off.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
So what?

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Your footings a bit off.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Move your left foot.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Follow through.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
Right.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Musical montage.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
It's a new way that you use it.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
I swing a sword.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Comes and goes.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
I try on different outfits.

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
I giggle and shake my head and say next with my mouth.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Visual gag.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Okay, right.

50:22.000 --> 50:29.000
So I go through a musical montage with Valis and do I learn how to use my sword better?

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Let's see here.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
Yep.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
Oh shit.

50:32.000 --> 50:38.000
Now you know how to use the secret of the far sword.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
But remember, you can only use it once in a short while.

50:41.000 --> 50:48.000
Why don't both of you guys use it on two of these doors and just in case there's something behind it,

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
I'm sure there's not like a beautiful human being on the other side, right?

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
That would be the worst-case scenario, yeah.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
In fact, you know what?

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Let me handle that part.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
If there's a beautiful human being on the other side of any of these fingers,

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
you're about to get far-sorted.

51:05.000 --> 51:10.000
If you're bound and gagged,

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
I'm bound and gagged now.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Don't sword.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
Yeah, knocking that pattern.

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
Also, if there's a less beautiful being, you too.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
You too, move.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
You'll also be hurt.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
Yeah, you'll be saving our lives.

51:26.000 --> 51:31.000
Okay, so why don't you guys far-sword through these holes?

51:31.000 --> 51:36.000
Okay, do we risk killing somebody that we don't want to kill?

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
You could close-sort them too.

51:38.000 --> 51:43.000
Like they're not across a chasm or anything, like you could walk up to it.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
But we're worried about something on the other side of them, like a trap or something.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Like something...

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
I got you.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
Like something like a trap that could be cut and destroyed with a sword?

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
Well, I have trap sense.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
That's true.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
I sense traps.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
You sense no traps?

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
Yeah.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
And?

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
And there's no traps?

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
I walk through the middle portal.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Nice.

52:05.000 --> 52:10.000
This passage has a high ceiling from which is hanging a large, shiny vein,

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
looking sack of flesh in the shape of the kidney vein.

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
Several arteries run from various walls into the dangling organ.

52:17.000 --> 52:22.000
A huge central cord seems to be its main support coming down from the ceiling.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
You can also see what appear to be blue-white sparks of light

52:25.000 --> 52:30.000
with multiple arching limbs crawling to and fro across the surface of the organ.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
I...

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
I...

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
I...

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
I asked Balacent if he'll follow me through the left...

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
a blood... what are the...

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
Tor...

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
Puck...

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Pucker thing.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Yeah.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
I'm stammering more than usual.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
I explain that to him that I...

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
I don't...

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
I...

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
I stammer sometimes and then I take him through the...

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
the left one.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Hey, man.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I'm a swordsman, not like a speech coach.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
Let's go.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
I'm not.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
I'm not.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
I'm not.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
I wasn't fishing for anything and I'm not.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I'm just explaining that I'm not.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
Are you a... if-finafishing for something?

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
Sweetie, go through the right door.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Because if we're going to take this thing out,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
we're going to have to kill its organs.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
I say all at once, you know?

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
I think that's a good idea.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
I will...

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Okay, so...

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
I'll go through the right door.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
I've been looking...

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
I think it's the kidney beans.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
That's probably the kidney, right?

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
The kidney.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
I'm looking at the kidney.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
It's an infinite kidney.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
An infidney.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
An infine...

53:33.000 --> 53:40.760
guys we're like a family let's all split up let's attack each organ that's all

53:40.760 --> 53:45.640
going through different or portals at once and it will each attack I'm saying

53:45.640 --> 53:48.440
I'm going through the left one with balance so I got the kidney so you go

53:48.440 --> 53:55.800
to the left portal what is it what do you see in there let's see here this area

53:55.800 --> 54:00.360
is more covered in veins and arteries than other rooms above you is an

54:00.360 --> 54:04.800
intricate lattice of pinkish fibers and rope like strands the lattice starts

54:04.800 --> 54:08.960
about 30 feet above your heads and the walls are pale pink spider web with the

54:08.960 --> 54:13.680
delicate filigree of the veins there are no exits but above you the whooshing of

54:13.680 --> 54:18.200
gases can be heard you occasionally see a flash of blue white sparks far over

54:18.200 --> 54:22.840
head as the lungs right it's gotta be the lungs baby yeah so I got the kidney you

54:22.840 --> 54:30.440
got the lungs Mulraine go into the right portal yes sir I go into the right

54:30.440 --> 54:35.160
portal four slippery slopes play before you stretching down through the

54:35.160 --> 54:41.440
blackness several hundred feet she found the balls you think that you can pick

54:41.440 --> 54:48.560
one of these but you shouldn't be able to climb up too easily it's like a like

54:48.560 --> 54:58.920
a water world or something you know like slides like water slides not not like

54:58.920 --> 55:04.400
the movie like the knock-off park there's a part called water world yeah

55:04.400 --> 55:09.960
man what are the odds that there wasn't a part called water like I'm just saying

55:09.960 --> 55:20.920
the burden of proof isn't on me okay so I'm in the kidney room yeah you are how

55:20.920 --> 55:26.040
far is that sack of kidney being shaped thing hanging above me I'd say it's a

55:26.040 --> 55:36.680
couple feet ahead all right so I I attack it with my vigor with my flaming

55:36.680 --> 55:42.680
sword flaming sword attack you strike the surface of the score the kidney being

55:42.680 --> 55:48.320
apparently scoring a huge slice across its surface it's then that you see the

55:48.320 --> 55:55.560
white blue sparks approach quickly they knit it back together healing it that's

55:55.560 --> 56:10.680
that's why it's not called a temporary fish yeah so you went south her yeah you

56:10.680 --> 56:17.400
can I punch up that that joke that's why they don't call it a finny fish yeah

56:17.400 --> 56:30.320
because it's fine yeah I got a finite fish you know what Madison I love your

56:30.320 --> 56:42.360
donuts there's just four slopes that go down work in different directions I'm

56:42.360 --> 56:54.080
gonna I'm gonna go for it great sense of adventure so I I jump down I close my

56:54.080 --> 57:00.760
eyes and I just jump randomly yeah

57:00.760 --> 57:06.840
speeding down the slippery slope find yourself on a cushy landing there

57:06.840 --> 57:11.720
appears to be a puddle of slime on the floor in a small spot that looks like a

57:11.720 --> 57:26.120
pulsating sphincter nearby you're several hundred feet and I meet her no

57:26.120 --> 57:32.680
way should we all go back up to the butthole we should all get back on that

57:32.680 --> 57:37.760
right you don't even know that happened can they hear me if I call up to them

57:37.760 --> 57:43.360
no I mean you just did and they didn't so okay what does this say silver staff

57:43.360 --> 57:48.280
of silk yeah silver do you remember that thing that you climbed up out of the

57:48.280 --> 57:53.440
hatch with all right yeah so it's it's a it's a long pole if you learn that if

57:53.440 --> 57:57.040
you tap it against something it gets longer and there's a button that you

57:57.040 --> 58:08.240
can press on it you don't know what it does it gets stuck they get stuck to get

58:08.240 --> 58:15.840
stuck for the button try to unstick it I tap the staff on it's stuck I try to

58:15.840 --> 58:21.840
unstick it it can't it's stuck you just said try to unstick it yeah try to

58:21.840 --> 58:28.080
unstick it stop telling me what to do if it's not gonna a bully I'm not I'm not

58:28.080 --> 58:35.400
hitting you I'm not hitting you I'm sorry the buttons not stuck the stick is

58:35.400 --> 58:44.960
stuck stuck in what stuck in wherever you had it last you just can't move it

58:44.960 --> 58:49.680
because it's stuck because it is a button stuck in this no the stick is stuck

58:49.680 --> 58:54.000
the buttons not stuck I'm sick the stack right so I push the button it becomes

58:54.000 --> 58:56.800
unstuck

59:01.760 --> 59:07.760
I can't get a read on this audience but I like it yeah I can't figure it out yeah I

59:07.760 --> 59:16.000
dig it well that was you know you just learned something did I yeah okay well

59:16.000 --> 59:23.840
let me see if I did I stick the stick into the meat around me okay you do that

59:23.840 --> 59:30.520
and it gets taller so if you hold on it'll it'll lift you into the air all

59:30.520 --> 59:36.560
right I I want to reduce it again okay how do I do that you tap it again I tap

59:36.560 --> 59:42.520
it there you go okay I push the button it gets stuck your relationship with

59:42.520 --> 59:47.120
spacer has become curiously more paternal just give me a second here will

59:47.120 --> 59:56.040
you I unstick I push the button again nice it gets unstuck okay okay it's like

59:56.040 --> 01:00:05.680
a tape measure okay okay all right I can do this exchange the best gets a free

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:12.360
t-shirt I want to I want to I mean I'm sure it's not my turn anymore because I

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:20.840
just did all that bullshit but you know if it were my turn and I'm not saying it

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:27.600
is but I would I would rather it not be so I can figure out what I want to do I

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:33.360
take out my my emerald dagger and attack the kidneys you attack the kidneys

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:41.000
let's see if you hit let's see if you do damage you do seven damage but again

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.040
those sparkles knit the wound up fuck the sparks crawl across the wound

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:55.720
mending it the sparks then approach you with menace they miss thank God for that

01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:01.160
I know what I want to do all right summon monster to okay want to summon my

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:07.600
squid okay can I control the squid does can I kind of like yeah I tell the

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:15.840
squid grab all those those lungs and squeeze them squeeze those lungs Albert

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:23.320
Albert the squid there are no lungs they there might be lungs far above you but

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:29.560
squeeze those alveoli squeeze those artery things that Spencer described the

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:35.120
squid fails to reach them they're too far overhead I press the button on the

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:41.240
squid

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:49.640
painted different squid guys sorry someone just asked question yeah all right

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:55.640
well well well well well I put the staff mm-hmm okay I tap it I'm gonna come

01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:01.880
to climb up there you're now on the lattice you could climb it easily as if

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:08.280
it were a ladder I do so you climb it easily as if it were a ladder

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:18.440
if everything about Spencer is how bored he seems you can see the flashes of

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.920
light get closer and brighter darting to and fro across the stance strands you

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.600
can make out the spidery figures composed of bright light or some sort of

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.400
energy shit the figures speed up as you get closer you can see at the heart of

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:36.320
this webby mesh is a large thin wall of membrane behind which a bright glow is

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.320
cast you hear the whooshing of gas exchange

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:45.160
respiration the membrane expands and contracts rhythmically that's the lungs

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.200
and I can't I can't reach that from here but I bet a guy with a far sword power

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.840
could I leave the kidney room and enjoy in Sharpie and the lung room I'd be too

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.040
convenient you don't know that he needs you I give it he's doing he's not doing

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:59.960
kidney room and climb back through the whatever me curtain or whatever portal I

went through you don't know what me curtain sharpies behind shit I go

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:11.480
through that the the left back portal all right great gas I remember he was

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:17.240
an lesson 30 feet overhead you see a pink mesh lattice of strands of some sort I

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:24.120
use my climb ability to climb up the lattice nope what attempting to scale

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:33.800
the wall you fail miserably you can see a silver staff reaching I tap I tap the

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:48.400
staff you climb up the staff above you you see the unprotected loins of a

01:04:48.400 --> 01:05:04.720
roped figure sharpie your loins are hanging out well they they don't do a

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:18.160
lot else calling upon your training and harnessing your rage

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:24.120
you brandish your sword with much bigger and expertise with one clean stroke you

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:29.320
make a burst of wind emanate forth from your sword a large slash appears in the

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.560
membrane you feel like you might be able to crawl through it I crawl through it

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:37.640
you crawl through it you're inside of what seems to be a large spherical

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.320
chamber there's holes in the ceiling and through those holes you hear a

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:46.480
gurgling noise before a large blob of snot drops onto the floor before you it

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:52.600
arranges itself into a spider-like form you see blades appear on its limbs Jesus

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:58.120
it looks ready to anger fight sure me get in here I go through the membrane

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:03.200
all right that happens mean meanwhile by the sphincter yeah so there's a puddle

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:12.400
of slime in that sphincter I tie some of my rope to an arrow okay and I shoot I

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:19.000
shoot the arrow up the up the slide from once I came you can't shoot that far but

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.040
I try really hard right or I shoot half as far can I get like half away up you

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:37.640
can get half the way up I go I go I go half half the way and I'm yep I shoot

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:42.960
another arrow to get the other way in the other half up while I'm doing this I'm

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:50.080
longing for for Sharpie I'm imagining that maybe that maybe quirk came across as

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:58.040
loins and I'm jealous with a sense of partial embarrassment and jealousy it

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:03.280
gets you towards the top of that ledge we were talking about

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:10.000
by the way for podcasts this is my my my best high school friend Dave Frito has been sitting up for the entire time

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:21.920
I say that as somebody who has known Dan for a very long time what advice do you

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:27.960
have to my character that's trying to seduce him

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:35.440
if my character perspective it's a it's a good question

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:48.480
you can try a color of submission you kind of have to give it to his crazy

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.400
ideas right so any of the wacky goofy concepts that he's gonna bring up and if

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:57.120
you can just simply follow it and support on that that's generally how it works best

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.120
for us for sure

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.800
where we have right now so I Dan and I were inside the lunch at the lung thing

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:11.360
and and she's inside the bubble or we don't know what you're back in the main

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:17.200
room now she's back and she was aware of where Dan went so you don't have the

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:23.080
bullshit can she rejoin us blue she's there okay so we're all the lungs right

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:39.160
now yep yep all right cliffhanger and let's please thank Dave Frito for

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:46.520
sitting up here showing you a severed tail and for setting me down the path

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:54.040
that led me here to playing judges and dragons with you because the truth is I

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.840
bought that judges and dragons shirt that Dave saw but I actually like I just

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.400
bought it because I thought it was cool and I wanted to seem like a guy that

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:08.080
played Dungeons and Dragons I bought it I think I went to Gen Con and bought it

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:13.320
all right we gotta we gotta we gotta wrap things up for better for worse yeah

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:19.800
yeah I know I know we were told to get out of here like 9 30 so yeah I mean I

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:22.760
was really gonna be we gotta be off quicker than that because they got a

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:30.640
they're gonna mop the stage for you're wrapped things up that was a W with an

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:38.080
RAP wrap things up you're from here Dan we came to Madison Milwaukee's only

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:43.040
well like an hour away yeah and you're in we didn't we didn't meet your family

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:51.280
bones didn't come your mom and dad didn't come my brother's my brother's

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.480
still mad because I read his emails and Adam Goldberg read his emails and you

01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:04.480
know I he wrote me even more hilarious emails about how mad he was I didn't

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:14.560
meet them because you know he's stupid and and he's overly dramatic and he's

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:20.640
five years older than me and he should he should he should be a big brother to

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:24.520
me and say you can do whatever you want you're my little brother but instead he's

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:29.920
a big knob and if you love your brother is it weird for you to come back to

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.040
Wisconsin and not not touch base at all with your family like they're only an

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.760
hour away and you rarely see them because what was last time you saw your

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:44.640
brother I don't know well I think it was like I think I came out for his

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.320
wedding to Milwaukee and he was gonna get married and then I had a big fight

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.520
with him the night before his wedding so that I just went to the zoo with my

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.360
girlfriend and went home

01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:03.760
now I don't like him and he doesn't like me we can't we can't be together

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.960
without fighting you know it's like do you think you'll ever like as you get

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.600
older you'll ever be friends with me again I don't know well I mean we've

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.960
gone through periods where several years go by I was like we're cool with each

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:18.560
other you know because he's he has his business you know like like like we we

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.640
we overlap with interests like we were both into like computer modeling for a

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.960
while and like but it's gotta it's like it's a relationship dependent on a lot

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:32.760
of time and space like between like receptors like anytime it gets you know

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:38.880
I it's hard for me to not piss him off in some way how about your mom and dad

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:46.640
they're in Florida they're in Florida is your grandpa still alive which grandpa

not stop but but you know what I never really realized no sacrifice meant

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.960
until I came to Madison

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:07.480

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.260
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:24.260
What?

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.300
Come on down to Harmontown, turn that frown upside down.

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:32.500
Alternately.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.460
Pease yellow poop is brown.

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:35.300
Like style.

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.500
Come on down to Harmontown.

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.660
Thank you so much, good night.

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:39.660
Oh, Wisconsin.

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:41.080
Thank you, Allison.

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:46.160
We did it.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.220
Thanks.

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:49.220
Bless you.

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.220
Bless you all.

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:03.220
Thank you, majestic leader. Thank you, man, as a mechanic.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:05.220
A little half music, please.

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:14.220
Thanks by all. Thanks, freedom.
