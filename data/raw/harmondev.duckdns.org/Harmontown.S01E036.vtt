Go Packers, go!\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nThat wasn't bad, Jeff.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nThat wasn't a bad rap.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\nWe're off to a good start.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:32.000\nIt wasn't a good one.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\nUnlike most of my raps, that was not bad.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:39.000\nI like that you fucked her fleas and her lice.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.000\nYeah, you can see where I think of the rhyme.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:45.000\nWhat's another thing like lice?\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:48.000\nDave Friedel, everybody.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nDave Friedel, my best friend.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:01.000\nI met Dave when I was 15, 14 years old.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:04.000\nI just transferred into Brown Deer High School\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:08.000\nin Brown Deer, Wisconsin, from Marshall High School,\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:10.000\njust 4,000 students.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:14.000\nAnd then I transferred into this 600 students\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nlike suburban high school.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:19.000\nNot the coolest entrance.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:22.000\nI wore a few fell pants.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:26.000\nI did own an Inspector Gadget raincoat,\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:29.000\nwhich I did wear frequently and blah, blah, blah.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nNot the coolest guy coming out of school.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nDave was the first guy who befriended me\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:37.000\nbecause he saw my Dungeons & Dragons t-shirt.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:40.000\nYeah, it was something along those lines.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nIt was one of those ones that were just in homeroom.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:46.000\nI think the D&D and the connection was made\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:50.000\nreal early on that freshman year.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:53.000\nI can't remember if it was you approached me first\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:55.000\nor I approached you or whatever it was,\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nbut I remember it was you coming up to me\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nand going, hey, you role-played?\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nYou saw my Dungeons & Dragons shirt,\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.000\nand I said, yeah, you used a computer?\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nIt was easy to be a nerd back then.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:13.000\nThere was one way to be a nerd back then.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nIf you had a computer, if you knew what one was\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nor how to turn it on, instead of a typewriter,\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nyou were a nerd.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nThere were TV shows about how people would use computers\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nto make the refrigerator open\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nor make the world go to war with itself\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:30.000\nbecause computers were magical and for nerds alone.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:33.000\nYou told me about the Citizen's Band emulator,\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:36.000\nwhich was this 300-baud chatroom,\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:41.000\nwhich is where I met the girl I lost my virginity to.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:44.000\nThe LA podcast episode where I'm reading from my journals,\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:47.000\nand I'm talking about the girl that I...\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nSam Pollution.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nYes, the girl that I...\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nThe condom froze to the...\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\nYeah, and I had such good sex with\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nthat she went to a mental hospital.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nThat was a...\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nI was a Stan Lee needs to come in the bottom and go,\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.000\nwebhands will remember Dan fucking a girl mental\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:07.000\nfrom issue number 128.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:10.000\nSo you fucked your brains out is what you're saying.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nWell, that's how we choose to interpret it,\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:15.000\nnot that I sent her into a lifelong depression\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:19.000\nwith my adolescent Ruddings.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nThe...\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nWhat my point is, Friedel is a linchpin.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nHe's a galactic nexus.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:30.000\nWe're so close to my hometown, Friedel came out here,\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:35.000\nand I want to talk about your toe.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nOh, man. Of course.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:43.000\nSo some woman made a theme song out there.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nYeah.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:50.000\nOh, Friedel's toe.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:54.000\nI think Peter Gabriel is here tonight.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:59.000\nFriedel, Friedel's toe, Friedel's toe.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nI think that pearls him.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nThere's a Friedel's toe.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:07.000\nCos he can't walk around.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:10.000\nThere's a George Michael version that's real popular, I think.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nYou got a blister on your toe.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nYeah, a blister.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nStory does not end there.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nNo, no, it doesn't end there.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nThe blister got a little out of control,\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nand I thought I'd taken care of it,\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.000\nand cleaned it up and was doing the proper care to it,\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nbut maybe I quit the antibiotics a little too early\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nor something along those lines.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nAnd so by mid-December,\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nwhen I started to notice the toes smelling like cheese,\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nI thought that there was...\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nToasteries are not going to make you feel warm and cuddly.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nIt's not date night.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:46.000\nWe're from Wisconsin here, so it's sort of a...\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:52.000\nYeah, it's a familiar smell or something.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:56.000\nWhen cottage cheese goes bad, so...\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:59.000\nYeah, so the toe started to go bad.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nWhat's your toe on which foot?\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nIt's the right.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:06.000\nThe right big toe.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nSo your big toe on your right foot?\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nYeah, it's a month removed.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.000\nIt's been gone?\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:12.000\nYeah, it's gone.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nNow, how does that affect your ability to stand up?\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nBut does it need big toes?\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.000\nIt seems to be doing pretty good in getting around.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nSo it turns out we don't...\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:23.000\nThe balance is all right.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nWe don't need our big toe for anything, do we?\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nI've been told, like, yeah,\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nunless I want to put basketball, you know what I mean?\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nWhat do they do with their big toe?\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:35.000\nI may have some calisthenics or jumping problems, but...\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nBut here's the creepy thing about the whole thing.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nCan we see it?\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:39.000\nCan you take it off?\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nIt's all bandaged up.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nIt's all bandaged up.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nHere's the weird thing, okay?\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:50.000\nAnd I'm going to approach the weirdness in stages.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:55.000\nOur dungeon master, Spencer, has two toes fused together,\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\nso he's technically also missing a toe.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:03.000\nDavid Friedel was my first dungeon and dragons buddy in high school.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:09.000\nDavid Friedel, his name is Germanic, Friedel,\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nbut what did we call you?\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:12.000\nFreedom.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nFree toe.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nFree toe.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nLike the corn chip.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:22.000\nHe is now free of a toe, like Spencer.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nWho has two toes fused together?\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nLess impressive to Spencer's audience than I am.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nLet's get started.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nYou're saying the string of meaningless quits and it says...\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nI'm saying...\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nLet's bring Spencer out right now.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nAlright, let's bring Spencer out.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nI want him to be free toe.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:54.000\nSpencer, this is my buddy, David Friedel.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:58.000\nThis is my first Spencer.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:02.000\nWe didn't really dungeon master, but we played D&D together, right?\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\nYeah, we did D&D together, but it was Shatter Ones.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nThat was the game that I ran later on.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nYou GM'd a little, right?\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nYeah, that was the game that I GM'd.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:15.000\nI mean, the Dungeons and Dragons sketch that you wrote for the Alewise,\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nI remember you ran that session,\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nand that was one of the first sessions\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nwhen the three or four of us all got together to start playing.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nIt was real early on freshman year,\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nand, you know, almost...\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:30.000\nI don't want to say verbatim that you took that set from that session,\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:34.000\nbut there's a lot of stuff that I remember that came out.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nYeah, that was a great thing.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nHow do you think Spencer's been doing?\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nOh, he's great.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nExcellent.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:50.000\nI spent the last couple of days really kind of catching up on the podcast tour\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nand things like that,\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nand even this afternoon with my wife,\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nwe were listening to the Turtle Panties episode,\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nwhere you sort of, in my opinion,\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nI think you were setting up the tour very, very well,\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\nso I'm just

the conception.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:31.000\nOh, I've smoked up so much weed.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nOh, I'm Ramon.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nI hate to tell you this.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nThat's just okay to tell you.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nI was cleaning his room.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:40.000\nI'm done.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:43.000\nI noticed there was some stuff\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:46.000\nin his underwear drawer.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:50.000\nYoungest son, what do you know about this?\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:53.000\nWell, considering that we share a bunk bed,\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:57.000\nwe shoot up like five times a week.\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nWell, I'm actually not high anymore.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\n29 is getting down.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nActually, I'm kind of hungry.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nI'll go down for dinner.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nActually, I am kind of hungry.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:08.000\nI'm down for dinner.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:09.000\nAll right, fantastic.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:10.000\nWhat are we getting?\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nBeans and rice, something like that?\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:17.000\nNo taco in the chiladas as usual.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:18.000\nI get high, okay?\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:23.000\nI get high.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:24.000\nI mean, why shouldn't I?\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nRight?\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nIt's a white man's country.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nI mean, what did it mean to them?\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:30.000\nWe're nothing.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nNothing!\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nHave you seen that cartoon about the Rubik's Cube?\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:37.000\nYou know, I mean, we've come a long way.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nNo, what do you mean?\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:42.000\nWell, there it is on the TV.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nWhat is that cube?\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nMultiple colors.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:47.000\nI get it.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nI get it.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:53.000\nI bet white people won't get it, but I do.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:54.000\nIt's diversity.\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:55.000\nIt's the Rubik's Cube.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:56.000\nI get it.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:58.000\nIt's the wave of the future.\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:00.000\nBut why, when you solve the cube,\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:04.000\ndo you do it by separating all the colors into sections?\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:08.000\n30 years later, I am remote.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:13.000\nI am a violent separatist.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:18.000\nI have taken over the world.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:22.000\nOh, I got shot in the head.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:26.000\nIt wasn't fatal, but oh, my parents, my family,\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:31.000\nmy white housekeeper.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:36.000\nI'm sorry I turned my back on you for 30 years.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:41.000\nI shouldn't have gotten high.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:45.000\nPorque!\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nThank you, Latinos.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nAll right, there are Latinos.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nOur Latino audience, everybody.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:58.000\nThank you so much.\n\n32:58.000 --> 32:59.000\nMake them dance.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:00.000\nMake them sing.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:04.000\nYou guys don't know how to approach these things delicately.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:07.000\nI live in Los Angeles.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:13.000\nThose are basically my people.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:18.000\nI can't step too far forward or it rings out.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:23.000\nJeff, this is your last show with us for a couple of shows.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:27.000\nI leave Harmontown for the next two shows.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:31.000\nI'll see if I can scramble to find somebody to fill in for you.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:36.000\nIs there any requests you have?\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:42.000\nI would like to see more Jerry McSeinfeld.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:50.000\nDan unleashed a new character where he's the Irish version of Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:53.000\nWe were in Chicago, I think.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:56.000\nNo, no, no. We were in Bloomington.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:59.000\nJerry McSeinfeld.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:02.000\nCan I get somebody in the audience?\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:05.000\nWhat's a pet peeve?\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:06.000\nJerks.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nJerks, okay.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nTalking on phones in line.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nTalking on phones in line.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nTalking on phones.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:17.000\nSomebody in line in front of you talking on a phone.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:21.000\nThis is Irish Jerry Seinfeld, Jerry McSeinfeld.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:27.000\nGood evening!\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nHi, hi!\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:32.000\nI would have gotten here sooner.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:35.000\nBut I have to wait in line.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nThere was a guy in front of me.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:40.000\nHe kept doing one of these. You ever see one of these?\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:45.000\nThis guy, this guy holding my hand up like a phone.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:48.000\nWho's he talking to?\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nWell, how's that conversation going?\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nOh, I'm in line.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:53.000\nHey, everyone's in line.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:56.000\nI'm not telling the world about it.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nYou want to call somebody?\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:01.000\nUse a phone booth.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nThank you, Dan.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:10.000\nWhat's up with all these phones?\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nWhen did phones become so important?\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:15.000\nIn my day, you didn't have to have a phone all the time.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nNow they're everywhere.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nI guess that's just technology.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:22.000\nSomething in the news.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nThe Taliban.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:27.000\nWhy do they call them the Taliban?\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:30.000\nThis sounds so playful.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nThe Taliban are coming over.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:34.000\nThat sounds fun, don't it?\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:38.000\nCall them the Skullfuckers or something.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:42.000\nCall them the booger-eaters.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:45.000\nAt least intimidate them a little bit.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nCall you the booger-eaters.\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:51.000\nThen I won't blow so many things up.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:55.000\nI observe these things with my Irish perspective.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nI share them.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nIf you agree, then you like it.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:02.000\nIf you don't, then I scratch it off my set list.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:07.000\nWhat's something that really gets your goat?\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nTo drive to work.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nTo drive to work?\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nI get you dead.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nThat expression, get me goat.\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nHow do you get someone's goat?\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nI don't want your goat.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nCan't you hold it down?\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:23.000\nWhy do you hold something up?\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:26.000\nWhy can't you hold it down?\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nHe's a little drunken.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nHe's a hot hot hot hot hot bull.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:35.000\nThat's just a few things I've been observing.\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:40.000\nI want a Jerry McSeinfeld rap.\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:43.000\nAbout whatever's in your mind.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nAlright.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:48.000\nBring it down.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:54.000\nYo, yo, I'm Jerry McSeinfeld, I'm here to say a few things I observed in a casual way.\n\n36:54.000 --> 37:00.000\nIf they resonate with you, I'd like you to laugh or applaud, and if you don't, what's up with giraffes?\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:04.000\nWhy are their necks so long? Why can't they eat smaller trees all along?\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:08.000\nOh, I went to the zoo. What's a cordon nut? It's not a nut!\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:14.000\nOh, please!\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:28.000\nWe gotta do a thing. I'm gonna go at a breakneck pace now and do some confusingly elaborate shit really fast.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:40.000\nMy hero and mentor who taught me not only improv but in comedy sports, how to be a cool, good person and have respect for the audience.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:50.000\nHis son was in Pittsburgh and freaked me out, and then he told his dad that I was coming to Madison and he came here.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:53.000\nBob Orvis, can you come up to the stage?\n\n37:53.000 --> 38:00.000\nBob Orvis.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:05.000\nWhoa, he bolted.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:12.000\nThere he is. Bob Orvis.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:23.000\nAnd Morgan Grobe, our tour manager, you need to come up here because I'm gonna use him for something.\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:26.000\nWe'll do it as quickly as possible because I have to do it. Where's Morgan?\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:29.000\nMorgan Grobe, everybody.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:32.000\nMorgan's the brains on the road. He keeps us on schedule.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:45.000\nOkay, we're gonna play Story because that was the first game I ever learned from Bob and it was the first time anyone ever respected me as an adult and said, hey, you're good at Story and I'm not good at it, but Jeff, you're gonna play it too.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:50.000\nAnd I feel like Spencer would be kind of good at this.\n\n38:50.000 --> 39:01.000\nAnd the interesting thing is when Dan was playing Story, he is right after he had his ass kicked in Milwaukee and his eyes were so swollen that he could only look up the bottom of his eyes.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:05.000\nSo getting his ass kicked was a true story.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:10.000\nAnd it wasn't Hispanic people that did it.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:14.000\nYou know what? It was Black people.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:23.000\nMaybe that's what it was. Maybe I got this ass beating and it was like, why did they hate me? What can I do for them?\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:29.000\nI don't know. I gotta work it out. I've got ten cities left or something. I'll figure out what my deal is with Ray's.\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nExplain the game for them.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:39.000\nWell, it's pretty simple. You tell a story. Whoever he points to, it tells a story until he points at someone else. It's like basic improv game.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:42.000\nHey, is there room for MacGaffies to have a mic?\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:45.000\nCan we have one of the mics?\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nWe only have four mics.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:51.000\nAll right. Eric MacGaffy, I'm ready.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:57.000\nWe can share our mics. Save Spencer until Spencer can observe how it works. I think he'll be okay with it.\n\n39:57.000 --> 40:00.000\nOkay. All right. Let's start. We need the title.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nA title of the story.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nDan Harmon's Excellent Adventure.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nDan Harmon's Excellent Adventure.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nDan Harmon's Excellent Adventure.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:16.000\nOkay. Fine. A little meta, but maybe it'll be a critical hit.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:25.000\nThank you. My jokes agent, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:31.000\nIt was a cold and windy night. Dan Harmon had just stopped fucking the lights off my mother.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:43.000\nWhen a thought occurred to him, what if I took a jar of peanut butter and wore it as a hat and became the mayor of Madison, Wisconsin?\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nWith that work?\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:54.000\nHe said to himself as he peeled sweaty socks off of his hands. It had been a long time since he peeled sweaty socks off of anything.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:57.000\nIf you know what I mean.\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:05.000\nBut we didn't know what he meant, so he demonstrated how he'd peel those hot, sweaty socks.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:10.000\nInch by inch. Inch by inch.\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:18.000\nThe painstakingly he pulled off the sock, peeling slowly off his sweat-stained skin.\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:21.000\nThe man decided to throw him against...\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:26.000\nthe fire, which had been firing in the corner.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:29.000\nFor centuries.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:34.000\nDan burst into the yard with a gun.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:39.000\nIt was a small gun. It was a harmless gun, because that's Dan Harmon.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nBelief, nonetheless.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:44.000\nNine rounds to kill nine people.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:50.000\nHe was going to rob nine people of their souls by shooting them.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:55.000\nI don't need to over-explain this, do I? I mean, it's murder. It's been around forever.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:58.000\nI'm sorry, I tried to make it fancy.\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:03.000\nDan walked into the yard with the gun and saw in the...\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:09.000\nCorner of the yard, a small flower. It changed his mind for a moment.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:14.000\nAnd then his mind changed back to murder.\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:21.000\nHe went somewhere absolutely... unusual.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:24.000\nHe decided he wasn't going to rip that flower apart.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:26.000\nHe was just not going to water it.\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:34.000\nHe just watched it sit and die.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:40.000\nWent the days as they flew off the calendar.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:44.000\nFinally, the flower died.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:48.000\nAnd he thought to himself, murder's a strange thing.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:51.000\nWhy did I walk out here with a gun?\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:58.000\nAnd then he remembered why and shot his next door neighbor, who was a man by the name of Fred.\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:02.000\nFred has been a gardener for about 14 years.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:15.000\nDan had stoned that gardener, that sexy little gardener, with his long shears and his flirtatious eyes,\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:21.000\nfull of little heart shapes.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:25.000\nWoo! Woo!\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:28.000\nThe police pulled up at Dan's apartment.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:34.000\nOh, what's all this then, said Officer McSeinfeld?\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:38.000\nI couldn't have but noticed that your front yard is a...\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:43.000\nA guest with dead people? What's with dead people?\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:47.000\nI just think it's a strange thing to have one's yard.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:51.000\nI mean, I'm no decorator, but I think I have a high-pitched voice.\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:57.000\nBecause I am Irish Seinfeld. What's the deal with blood on your shoes?\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:01.000\nWhy do they come to yards where they're foot?\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:04.000\nI mean, they're arranged in feet.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nRight?\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:11.000\nHey, why are we all sucking helium? We were asking each other.\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:21.000\nSuddenly, Dan turned to the side, and he saw Fredo's toe creeping toward him.\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:28.000\nIt menaced slowly in the side yard of the shade as it revealed itself.\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:35.000\nHi, Dan. Would you like a piece of cake?\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:40.000\nFredo's toe...\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:43.000\nMake it flow like...\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nYeah!\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:49.000\nFor all the children!\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nWhen Dan's gun...\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:54.000\nHe shot Irish Seinfeld.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:58.000\nOh, why do they call it getting shot?\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:02.000\nSaid Irish Seinfeld.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:07.000\nWhy don't they call it getting bulleted?\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nBob Armist, everybody!\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:12.000\nBob Armist!\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:16.000\nI love you, Bob. Thank you.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:20.000\nYeah.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nHe taught you well.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:24.000\nI did it. We did it.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nI used to do that for a living.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:29.000\nNow I do this, not for a living.\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:32.000\nI don't know how much of it makes any sense.\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.000\nDan, you know what time it is?\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:40.000\nIt's D&D time.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nSpencer, if you would.\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nRelease the character sheets.\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nErin McGathy, back to the stage.\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:49.000\nI lost my vodka cup.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:50.000\nOh, it's behind you.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:51.000\nOkay, thank you, sir. Thank you.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:55.000\nFinally, someone in the audience yells out something practical.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:58.000\nWith the location of my booze.\n\n45:58.000 --> 45:59.000\nI'm sorry. That was abusive.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:00.000\nYou know what it is?\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nIt's like, you leave the Midwest, you come back,\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:03.000\nand you start acting like a dick.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry.\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:08.000\nIs there any way your shoes untied?\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:13.000\nSomeone just told me my shoes untied.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:17.000\nAnd when someone tells me my shoes untied,\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:22.000\nI go berserk.\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:25.000\nYes, I know it's untied.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nAll right, Spencer, if you would,\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nbring us up to date in our campaign.\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:35.000\nLast time on Dragon Ball Z.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nOkay, okay.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nOur hero is trapped.\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:44.000\nStay up there, Fredo.\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nOur heroes, trapped deep within the bowels\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nof the mythical Infinifish,\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\ndiscover a master swordsman.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:51.000\nAfter some prodding,\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:52.000\nVala sent the swordsman\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:55.000\ndecided to journey deeper with the party.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nThey headed fish west to a passage\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\ncovered in acid-filled trenches.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nUsing tender floating discs\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:02.000\nacross the passage,\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:05.000\nthey launched themselves through a meat curtain.\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:08.000\nThere, they saw a mysterious ice dock.\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:09.000\nUsing multiple abilities,\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\nthe creature charmed quark.\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:14.000\nBut after a fearsome nail-biting action sequence,\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nthe eye was destroyed.\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nThe group looked on to the three ways ahead\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:21.000\nbefore deciding which way to proceed.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nSo do you guys remember you just killed that eye thing?\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nThere's three different paths.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:26.000\nRight.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:29.000\nYeah, there's three blue portals, right?\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nYeah, they're like holes in the wall.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nAre they labeled at all?\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nThey are not labeled.\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:36.000\nAs a ranger,\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:39.000\ndo we have any sense for the right direction?\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nYou have a pretty good sense of direction,\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nbut most of that is reliant on weather\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nand or local flora and fauna\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:48.000\nand not the other portals of a beast.\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:49.000\nGentlemen, I'm pretty confident\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nit's like door on the far right.\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:54.000\nAll right.\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:57.000\nOr power of elimination.\n\n47:57.000 --> 48:01.000\nI detect magic on all three of these orifices.\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nNeither of them are magical.\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nNone of them are magical.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:06.000\nAll right.\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:10.000\nBeing a barbarian known for my whimsy,\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:13.000\nI walk up to the center portal\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:17.000\nand I approach it and examine it.\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:21.000\nIt looks the same as the other two.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nHow big is it?\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:24.000\nWhat's up?\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:25.000\nHow large is this portal?\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:29.000\nI'd place it at about two and a half feet wide.\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:34.000\nI put a finger in it.\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nNothing happens.\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:37.000\nOkay.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:40.000\nI ask the far left door if I say,\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:42.000\nif I ask the right door,\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\nif I should take the middle door,\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:47.000\nwill it tell me yes?\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:50.000\nIt gives a fever, it's feeble to the shuttle.\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:52.000\nDance, magic dance.\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\nVellison pipes up.\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nWhat are you guys doing?\n\n48:58.000 --> 48:59.000\nStick.\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:01.000\nOh, I like it.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:02.000\nWe're doing bits.\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nWe thought we were going to talk about swords.\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:07.000\nHey, Vellison, nice sword you got there.\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nHey, man, thanks.\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nWhere'd you get that sword?\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:15.000\nIt was forged in the fire of several thousand fire elementals.\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:16.000\nNo shit?\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nNo, it wasn't.\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nI have an emerald dagger.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nDo you like daggers or just swords?\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:25.000\nThey're like the baby sword.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:27.000\nHave you seen my flaming sword?\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:28.000\nIt's pretty wild.\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:29.000\nI've seen it.\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:32.000\nCan you make it strike far away?\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:35.000\nNot yet, but can you teach me how to do that?\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nWell, as it happens, I can.\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:40.000\nBut it involves harnessing your rage.\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:44.000\nI harness my rage to learn how to do something.\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:47.000\nIf it were that easy, you don't know.\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nI'm an angry student.\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nWell, let's see.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:52.000\nSwing your sword.\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:53.000\nI swing my sword.\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:54.000\nNice.\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:59.000\nYour foot, your footings a bit off.\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:00.000\nSo what?\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nYour footings a bit off.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:03.000\nMove your left foot.\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:04.000\nFollow through.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:05.000\nRight.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:06.000\nMusical montage.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:09.000\nIt's a new way that you use it.\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nI swing a sword.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:12.000\nComes and goes.\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:15.000\nI try on different outfits.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:20.000\nI giggle and shake my head and say next with my mouth.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:21.000\nVisual gag.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:22.000\nOkay, right.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:29.000\nSo I go through a musical montage with Valis and do I learn how to use my sword better?\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:30.000\nLet's see here.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:31.000\nYep.\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:32.000\nOh shit.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:38.000\nNow you know how to use the secret of the far sword.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:41.000\nBut remember, you can only use it once in a short while.\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:48.000\nWhy don't both of you guys use it on two of these doors and just in case there's something behind it,\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:53.000\nI'm sure there's not like a beautiful human being on the other side, right?\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:56.000\nThat would be the worst-case scenario, yeah.\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:57.000\nIn fact, you know what?\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:58.000\nLet me handle that part.\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:02.000\nIf there's a beautiful human being on the other side of any of these fingers,\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:05.000\nyou're about to get far-sorted.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:10.000\nIf you're bound and gagged,\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:13.000\nI'm bound and gagged now.\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nDon't sword.\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:18.000\nYeah, knocking that pattern.\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:22.000\nAlso, if there's a less beautiful being, you too.\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:23.000\nYou too, move.\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:25.000\nYou'll also be hurt.\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:26.000\nYeah, you'll be saving our lives.\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:31.000\nOkay, so why don't you guys far-sword through these holes?\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:36.000\nOkay, do we risk killing somebody that we don't want to kill?\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nYou could close-sort them too.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:43.000\nLike they're not across a chasm or anything, like you could walk up to it.\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:47.000\nBut we're worried about something on the other side of them, like a trap or something.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:48.000\nLike something...\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:49.000\nI got you.\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:52.000\nLike something like a trap that could be cut and destroyed with a sword?\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:53.000\nYeah.\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:54.000\nWell, I have trap sense.\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:55.000\nThat's true.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:56.000\nI sense traps.\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\nYou sense no traps?\n\n51:58.000 --> 51:59.000\nYeah.\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:00.000\nAnd?\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:01.000\nAnd there's no traps?\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:04.000\nI walk through the middle portal.\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:05.000\nNice.\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:10.000\nThis passage has a high ceiling from which is hanging a large, shiny vein,\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:13.000\nlooking sack of flesh in the shape of the kidney vein.\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:17.000\nSeveral arteries run from various walls into the dangling organ.\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:22.000\nA huge central cord seems to be its main support coming down from the ceiling.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:25.000\nYou can also see what appear to be blue-white sparks of light\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:30.000\nwith multiple arching limbs crawling to and fro across the surface of the organ.\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:31.000\nI...\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:32.000\nI...\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:33.000\nI...\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:37.000\nI asked Balacent if he'll follow me through the left...\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:40.000\na blood... what are the...\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:41.000\nTor...\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:42.000\nPuck...\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:43.000\nPucker thing.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:44.000\nYeah.\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nI'm stammering more than usual.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nI explain that to him that I...\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:49.000\nI don't...\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:50.000\nI...\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:54.000\nI stammer sometimes and then I take him through the...\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:55.000\nthe left one.\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:56.000\nHey, man.\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nI'm a swordsman, not like a speech coach.\n\n52:58.000 --> 52:59.000\nLet's go.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:00.000\nI'm not.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:01.000\nI'm not.\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:02.000\nI'm not.\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:03.000\nI wasn't fishing for anything and I'm not.\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nI'm just explaining that I'm not.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:08.000\nAre you a... if-finafishing for something?\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:12.000\nSweetie, go through the right door.\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nBecause if we're going to take this thing out,\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nwe're going to have to kill its organs.\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:17.000\nI say all at once, you know?\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:18.000\nI think that's a good idea.\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:19.000\nI will...\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:20.000\nOkay, so...\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:21.000\nI'll go through the right door.\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:22.000\nI've been looking...\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:23.000\nI think it's the kidney beans.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nThat's probably the kidney, right?\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:26.000\nThe kidney.\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:27.000\nI'm looking at the kidney.\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nIt's an infinite kidney.\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nAn infidney.\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nAn infine...\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:40.760\nguys we're like a family let's all split up let's attack each organ that's all\n\n53:40.760 --> 53:45.640\ngoing through different or portals at once and it will each attack I'm saying\n\n53:45.640 --> 53:48.440\nI'm going through the left one with balance so I got the kidney so you go\n\n53:48.440 --> 53:55.800\nto the left portal what is it what do you see in there let's see here this area\n\n53:55.800 --> 54:00.360\nis more covered in veins and arteries than other rooms above you is an\n\n54:00.360 --> 54:04.800\nintricate lattice of pinkish fibers and rope like strands the lattice starts\n\n54:04.800 --> 54:08.960\nabout 30 feet above your heads and the walls are pale pink spider web with the\n\n54:08.960 --> 54:13.680\ndelicate filigree of the veins there are no exits but above you the whooshing of\n\n54:13.680 --> 54:18.200\ngases can be heard you occasionally see a flash of blue white sparks far over\n\n54:18.200 --> 54:22.840\nhead as the lungs right it's gotta be the lungs baby yeah so I got the kidney you\n\n54:22.840 --> 54:30.440\ngot the lungs Mulraine go into the right portal yes sir I go into the right\n\n54:30.440 --> 54:35.160\nportal four slippery slopes play before you stretching down through the\n\n54:35.160 --> 54:41.440\nblackness several hundred feet she found the balls you think that you can pick\n\n54:41.440 --> 54:48.560\none of these but you shouldn't be able to climb up too easily it's like a like\n\n54:48.560 --> 54:58.920\na water world or something you know like slides like water slides not not like\n\n54:58.920 --> 55:04.400\nthe movie like the knock-off park there's a part called water world yeah\n\n55:04.400 --> 55:09.960\nman what are the odds that there wasn't a part called water like I'm just saying\n\n55:09.960 --> 55:20.920\nthe burden of proof isn't on me okay so I'm in the kidney room yeah you are how\n\n55:20.920 --> 55:26.040\nfar is that sack of kidney being shaped thing hanging above me I'd say it's a\n\n55:26.040 --> 55:36.680\ncouple feet ahead all right so I I attack it with my vigor with my flaming\n\n55:36.680 --> 55:42.680\nsword flaming sword attack you strike the surface of the score the kidney being\n\n55:42.680 --> 55:48.320\napparently scoring a huge slice across its surface it's then that you see the\n\n55:48.320 --> 55:55.560\nwhite blue sparks approach quickly they knit it back together healing it that's\n\n55:55.560 --> 56:10.680\nthat's why it's not called a temporary fish yeah so you went south her yeah you\n\n56:10.680 --> 56:17.400\ncan I punch up that that joke that's why they don't call it a finny fish yeah\n\n56:17.400 --> 56:30.320\nbecause it's fine yeah I got a finite fish you know what Madison I love your\n\n56:30.320 --> 56:42.360\ndonuts there's just four slopes that go down work in different directions I'm\n\n56:42.360 --> 56:54.080\ngonna I'm gonna go for it great sense of adventure so I I jump down I close my\n\n56:54.080 --> 57:00.760\neyes and I just jump randomly yeah\n\n57:00.760 --> 57:06.840\nspeeding down the slippery slope find yourself on a cushy landing there\n\n57:06.840 --> 57:11.720\nappears to be a puddle of slime on the floor in a small spot that looks like a\n\n57:11.720 --> 57:26.120\npulsating sphincter nearby you're several hundred feet and I meet her no\n\n57:26.120 --> 57:32.680\nway should we all go back up to the butthole we should all get back on that\n\n57:32.680 --> 57:37.760\nright you don't even know that happened can they hear me if I call up to them\n\n57:37.760 --> 57:43.360\nno I mean you just did and they didn't so okay what does

it's a long pole if you learn that if\n\n57:53.440 --> 57:57.040\nyou tap it against something it gets longer and there's a button that you\n\n57:57.040 --> 58:08.240\ncan press on it you don't know what it does it gets stuck they get stuck to get\n\n58:08.240 --> 58:15.840\nstuck for the button try to unstick it I tap the staff on it's stuck I try to\n\n58:15.840 --> 58:21.840\nunstick it it

button it becomes\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:56.800\nunstuck\n\n59:01.760 --> 59:07.760\nI can't get a read on this audience but I like it yeah I can't figure it out yeah I\n\n59:07.760 --> 59:16.000\ndig it well that was you know you just learned something did I yeah okay well\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:23.840\nlet me see if I did I stick the stick into the meat around me okay you do that\n\n59:23.840 --> 59:30.520\nand it gets taller so if you hold on it'll it'll lift you into the air all\n\n59:30.520 --> 59:36.560\nright I I want to reduce it again okay how do I do that you tap it again I tap\n\n59:36.560 --> 59:42.520\nit there you go okay I push the button it gets stuck your relationship with\n\n59:42.520 --> 59:47.120\nspacer has become curiously more paternal just give me a second here will\n\n59:47.120 --> 59:56.040\nyou I unstick I push the button again nice it gets unstuck okay okay it's like\n\n59:56.040 --> 01:00:05.680\na tape measure okay okay all right I can do this exchange the best gets a free\n\n01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:12.360\nt-shirt I want to I want to I mean I'm sure it's not my turn anymore because I\n\n01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:20.840\njust did all that

01:00:33.360\ntake out my my emerald dagger and attack the kidneys you attack the kidneys\n\n01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:41.000\nlet's see if you hit let's see if you do damage you do seven damage but again\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.040\nthose sparkles knit the wound up fuck the sparks crawl across the wound\n\n01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:55.720\nmending it the sparks then approach you with menace they miss thank God for that\n\n01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:01.160\nI know what I want to do all right summon monster to okay want to summon my\n\n01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:07.600\nsquid okay can I control

01:01:23.320\nAlbert the squid there are no lungs they there might be lungs far above you but\n\n01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:29.560\nsqueeze those alveoli squeeze those artery things that Spencer described the\n\n01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:35.120\nsquid fails to reach them they're too far overhead I press the button on the\n\n01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:41.240\nsquid\n\n01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:49.640\npainted different squid guys sorry someone just asked question yeah all right\n\n01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:55.640\nwell well well well well I put the staff mm-hmm okay I tap it I'm gonna come\n\n01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:01.880\nto climb up there you're now on the lattice you could climb it easily as if\n\n01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:08.280\nit were a ladder I do so you climb it easily as if it were a ladder\n\n01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:18.440\nif everything about Spencer is how bored he seems you can see the flashes of\n\n01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.920\nlight get closer and brighter darting to and fro across the stance strands you\n\n01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.600\ncan make out the spidery figures composed of bright light or some sort of\n\n01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.400\nenergy shit the figures speed up as you get closer you can see at the heart of\n\n01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:36.320\nthis webby mesh is a large thin wall of membrane behind which a bright glow is\n\n01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.320\ncast you hear the whooshing of gas exchange\n\n01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:45.160\nrespiration the membrane expands and contracts rhythmically that's the lungs\n\n01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.200\nand I can't I can't reach that from here but I bet a guy with a far sword power\n\n01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.840\ncould I leave the kidney room and enjoy in Sharpie and the lung room I'd be too\n\n01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.040\nconvenient you don't know that he needs you I give it he's doing he's not doing\n\n01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:03.520\nfor that reason he's doing it because I he owes me five dollars yeah I get\n\n01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:08.400\nlonely and I leave the kidney room and I call out to Sharpie flash flash back to\n\n01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:13.280\nyesterday hey cake

sharpies behind shit I go\n\n01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:11.480\nthrough that the the left back portal all right great gas I remember he was\n\n01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:17.240\nan lesson 30 feet overhead you see a pink mesh lattice of strands of some sort I\n\n01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:24.120\nuse my climb ability to climb up the lattice nope what attempting to scale\n\n01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:33.800\nthe wall you fail miserably you can see a silver staff reaching I tap I tap the\n\n01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:48.400\nstaff you climb up the staff above you you see the unprotected loins of a\n\n01:04:48.400 --> 01:05:04.720\nroped figure sharpie your loins are hanging out well they they don't do a\n\n01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:18.160\nlot else calling upon your training and harnessing your rage\n\n01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:24.120\nyou brandish your sword with much bigger and expertise with one clean stroke you\n\n01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:29.320\nmake a burst of wind emanate forth from your sword a large slash appears in the\n\n01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.560\nmembrane you feel like you might be able to crawl through it I crawl through it\n\n01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:37.640\nyou crawl through it you're inside of what seems to be a large spherical\n\n01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.320\nchamber there's holes in the ceiling and through those holes you hear a\n\n01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:46.480\ngurgling noise before a large blob of snot drops onto the floor before you it\n\n01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:52.600\narranges itself into a spider-like form you see blades appear on its limbs Jesus\n\n01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:58.120\nit looks ready to anger fight sure me get in here I go through the membrane\n\n01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:03.200\nall right that happens mean meanwhile by the sphincter yeah so there's a puddle\n\n01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:12.400\nof slime in that sphincter I tie some of my rope to an arrow okay and I shoot I\n\n01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:19.000\nshoot the arrow up the up the slide from once I came you can't shoot that far but\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.040\nI try really hard right or I shoot half as far can I get like half away up you\n\n01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:37.640\ncan get half the way up I go I go I go half half the way and I'm yep I shoot\n\n01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:42.960\nanother arrow to get the other way in the other half up while I'm doing this I'm\n\n01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:50.080\nlonging for for Sharpie I'm imagining that maybe that maybe quirk came across as\n\n01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:58.040\nloins and I'm jealous with a sense of partial embarrassment and jealousy it\n\n01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:03.280\ngets you towards the top of that ledge we were talking about\n\n01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:10.000\nby the way for podcasts this is my my my best high school friend Dave Frito has been sitting up for the entire time\n\n01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:21.920\nI say that as somebody who has known Dan for a very long time what advice do you\n\n01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:27.960\nhave to my character that's trying to seduce him\n\n01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:35.440\nif my character perspective it's a it's a good question\n\n01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:48.480\nyou can try a color of submission you kind of have to give it to his crazy\n\n01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.400\nideas right so any of the wacky goofy concepts that he's gonna bring up and if\n\n01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:57.120\nyou can just simply follow it and support on that that's generally how it works best\n\n01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.120\nfor us for sure\n\n01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.800\nwhere we have right now so I Dan and I were inside the lunch at the lung thing\n\n01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:11.360\nand and she's inside the bubble or we don't know what you're back in the main\n\n01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:17.200\nroom now she's back and she was aware of where Dan went so you don't have the\n\n01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:23.080\nbullshit can she rejoin us blue she's there okay
