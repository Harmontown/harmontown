WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:27.680
Here we are, welcome everybody from the fantabulous confines of the dynasty typewriter here in

00:27.680 --> 00:31.280
MacArthur Park with a sweeping icing that's flowing down.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.280
Harmontown is now in session.

00:33.280 --> 00:37.280
All right.

00:37.280 --> 00:44.880
Spencer Crittenden.

00:44.880 --> 00:56.960
And just for good measure, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:56.960 --> 01:12.640
Here we are, welcome everybody from the fantabulous confines of the dynasty typewriter here in

01:12.640 --> 01:35.840
MacArthur Park with a sweeping icing that's flowing down.

01:35.840 --> 01:43.200
The mayor of Tijuana would be like, you have a point about our bathrooms.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.520
They are not a place for surgery to take place.

01:47.520 --> 01:54.320
I think if you wash your hands during Comic-Con, they get dirtier than if you just don't wash

01:54.320 --> 01:55.320
them.

01:55.320 --> 01:59.040
Anyways, thank you for that.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.040
I like that beat.

02:00.040 --> 02:03.680
That was like a very old Western, it felt like I was on a prairie.

02:03.680 --> 02:11.200
Let's give it up for Zac McKeever up on the beat booth.

02:11.200 --> 02:18.520
But don't let my forced anxiety driven rhymes cast a pallor on what was really probably

02:18.520 --> 02:21.800
one of the most delightful Comic-Cons ever, which is saying a lot because I always have

02:21.800 --> 02:22.800
a good time there.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.800
Did you have a good time at Comic-Con?

02:24.800 --> 02:25.800
Oh boy.

02:25.800 --> 02:31.120
You love crowds and adulation and it was packed this year.

02:31.120 --> 02:35.800
I felt like on Thursday it was as packed as Friday, and on Friday I thought it was as

02:35.800 --> 02:38.720
packed as it was on Saturday of the prior year.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.280
I didn't go on Saturday because I was terrified.

02:41.280 --> 02:51.360
It's kind of interesting this year, I'm in some kind of limbo where I'm constantly aware

02:51.360 --> 02:58.080
of like, okay Harmon, this is a thing to not be taken for granted getting on a golf cart

02:58.080 --> 03:02.600
and doing this thing, it's a thing that you keep doing.

03:02.600 --> 03:07.480
You never say no to it, you go there, you definitely like it, it's a religious experience

03:07.480 --> 03:08.480
for you.

03:08.480 --> 03:13.120
You go there and it's like Mecca for all these people and you're a part of that, you're a

03:13.120 --> 03:20.320
little baby priest or cardinal, dare I say, within this Vatican of, these are probably

03:20.320 --> 03:24.440
bad metaphors to draw upon in our turbulent times.

03:24.440 --> 03:29.560
What metaphor, what analogy can you use anymore?

03:29.560 --> 03:37.920
But anyways, this year I was kind of like, I was so afraid to either take it for granted

03:37.920 --> 03:42.760
or overindulge in it, like I'm sick of my own face and voice, so I'm like, I don't want

03:42.760 --> 03:48.120
to be a rock star, nor do I want to pretend like I don't love this experience, that I

03:48.120 --> 03:54.280
ended up in this totally zen, I was like, this is what it is, this is what you do, can

03:54.280 --> 04:00.520
you get to the lobby by 11am, 6am, can you be here and talk to this person, is that,

04:00.520 --> 04:05.600
and then you, and then what I didn't do is go to the entertainment weekly party.

04:05.600 --> 04:12.280
I didn't do these things that aren't in the moment, because trying to get into the entertainment

04:12.280 --> 04:20.320
weekly party is like the last, they do that, the entertainment weekly party is a pagan

04:20.320 --> 04:26.400
ritual at Comic-Con that is specifically designed to remind everyone that they are technically

04:26.400 --> 04:33.640
nerds and that that still means being unempowered and gross.

04:33.640 --> 04:39.920
You could show up for the entertainment weekly party at 7pm with 40 tickets and 20 wrist

04:39.920 --> 04:47.120
bands and a signed affidavit from Steven Spielberg saying, I approve of these invitations that

04:47.120 --> 04:53.880
you sent to this person, you could represent 50% of the guest list and they would still

04:53.880 --> 04:57.920
be like, well, I don't know, it's kind of a hot scene, can you wait over there for a

04:57.920 --> 05:01.920
second and you're just like, come on, let me talk to Adam Savage and get out of here,

05:01.920 --> 05:07.320
I'm tired, anyways, but I didn't go, I didn't go, and I didn't really see any of our famous

05:07.320 --> 05:09.360
friends, I didn't even see you.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.360
Yeah, one of your most famous friends.

05:11.360 --> 05:16.720
I would see you, I would just see you over in the corner of something.

05:16.720 --> 05:20.080
In the boat, that was basically one of the only places we saw each other, I think, on

05:20.080 --> 05:21.080
that boat.

05:21.080 --> 05:26.920
And I might look back at this as the year when it was the peak of maybe because given

05:26.920 --> 05:34.320
my age range, my trajectory, I wouldn't be surprised to find out this was the year when,

05:34.320 --> 05:39.480
if you could measure it, like the most of my personal friends and acquaintances and things

05:39.480 --> 05:42.760
that I care about were there.

05:42.760 --> 05:47.920
Yeah, I didn't really, I just kind of floated around like a, like a do the same boat that

05:47.920 --> 05:52.400
we, I was on like that kind of weird, like old, old school yachts, even better, Jeff.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.400
Even better.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.400
Oh yeah.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.960
This one had water jet pack people.

05:55.960 --> 05:56.960
I saw that.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.440
There was a dude at night with like light up.

05:59.440 --> 06:03.840
Let's talk about the water jet pack people and Justin found out that you can't do fireworks,

06:03.840 --> 06:06.720
the city or Harbor master or whatever I'm saying.

06:06.720 --> 06:07.720
They hate that.

06:07.720 --> 06:08.720
You can't do fireworks.

06:08.720 --> 06:15.320
I said, Justin, because what could be more flammable than the ocean?

06:15.320 --> 06:18.120
Justin Roiland co-creator Rick and Morty.

06:18.120 --> 06:22.200
He gets a yacht with his buddies every, every year it's become a tradition and he wanted

06:22.200 --> 06:25.040
to do fireworks on it.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.440
And they said, no, you can't do that.

06:26.440 --> 06:30.920
But what you can do, I don't know if they provide this, this, this alternative.

06:30.920 --> 06:31.920
Yeah.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.320
You could call this number.

06:33.320 --> 06:41.040
There's these two guys that adorn themselves in Christmas lights and hover over the ocean

06:41.040 --> 06:44.280
on fire hose jet packs.

06:44.280 --> 06:49.680
And I spent most of the night talking to the Star of Farscape about whether or not those

06:49.680 --> 06:51.240
guys had other jobs.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.720
And that was the most fun.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.520
I was just saying, I took an extra 10 milligrams of Adderall.

06:56.520 --> 06:57.960
I was shit-faced.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.080
I feel bad for the Star of Farscape.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.640
I never met him.

07:02.640 --> 07:06.800
I really, him and the Onion Knight, I just, I'll never see them again.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.720
The, the man, I fucking let Liam Cunningham have it.

07:10.720 --> 07:14.280
Don't be the last Game of Thrones guy at the Justin Roiland yacht party with Dan Harmon

07:14.280 --> 07:15.280
on it.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.360
You're going to get all of that.

07:17.360 --> 07:22.480
I don't, I was, I was, I was, I was scattered the last time I was like, oh, I can do shots

07:22.480 --> 07:23.480
with Ramsay Bolton.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.080
I was just, just the Onion Knight.

07:25.080 --> 07:31.840
I was just like, gear mirror like my, your character's like me.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.440
I got no fingers.

07:33.440 --> 07:37.200
I lost my fingers.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.240
Yeah.

07:39.240 --> 07:43.000
That last, last time I was there, there was that boat and then I turned the corner and

07:43.000 --> 07:47.480
there was Sam, the, the, the, the chubby, oh yeah, reading guy.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.480
He talks to my ex.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.480
Wait.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.480
Okay.

07:51.480 --> 07:58.280
Let's, let's, let's take, let's take a little bit more about that.

07:58.280 --> 08:07.520
Oh, the, Jesus, God, anyway, I got to get out of here, no, no, on that boat party.

08:07.520 --> 08:13.960
He was talking to my then girlfriend and we broke up at a point, but then like his birthday

08:13.960 --> 08:17.200
rolled around it like she commissioned a picture for him for his birthday.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.000
I'm like, oh, I guess they still talk.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
That's cool.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.240
He, you know, he won the game of thrones, he kind of did.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.240
He kind of did.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.240
Yeah.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.760
And did you put the timeline together ever and go, wait a minute, is he the causal thing

08:30.760 --> 08:31.760
about all this?

08:31.760 --> 08:32.920
It's like, I hope so.

08:32.920 --> 08:34.480
That would be awesome.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.280
She met him on a boat, then we broke up.

08:37.280 --> 08:41.520
Then she drew a painting of him and then, yeah, that's, that is, yep.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.520
That would fit.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.520
The timeline works.

08:43.520 --> 08:47.960
Those three things did happen in that order because we were dating.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.360
That's kind of the role that he had in the show.

08:50.360 --> 08:55.240
He was like, oh, I'm no, I'm no brand, the broken, but I really am the metaphor for the

08:55.240 --> 08:59.120
author and the puppet master of everything and nothing battle ever happened to me and

08:59.120 --> 09:07.440
I'll just, I just, I'm going to get all the, the West Westeros Puss and she was pregnant

09:07.440 --> 09:08.440
too.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.440
What?

09:09.440 --> 09:10.440
No, no.

09:10.440 --> 09:11.440
Oh, because Gilly was pregnant.

09:11.440 --> 09:12.440
Okay.

09:12.440 --> 09:20.160
Uh, were there, were there more G.O.G. folks on the boat, no, no, no were there far scape

09:20.160 --> 09:25.840
folks, Lin-Manuel Miranda was there, my good friend.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.040
Did you guys squash your beef?

09:27.040 --> 09:31.440
No, we were back to back for an uncomfortable amount of time.

09:31.440 --> 09:36.640
I should, every time, I don't know, I, I, when I left that party, I identified several

09:36.640 --> 09:38.960
errors that I made and that was one of them.

09:38.960 --> 09:44.640
Oh boy, there was about six or seven crucial errors that I made and Lord knows what the

09:44.640 --> 09:47.440
party would have been a mile like if I did not make those errors.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.920
I probably wouldn't be here tonight.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.600
Lin and I collectively, although I want to say I had no fucking part of this.

09:53.600 --> 10:02.800
I don't know if he, how much he did, but like somehow we, after the boat closed, um, we accidentally

10:02.800 --> 10:10.960
spread the idea that there was a party happening at the Hilton and when the reality was the

10:10.960 --> 10:16.880
only thing happening at the Hilton was us going to bed and we, we, we, we horribly

10:16.880 --> 10:21.200
piped like a bunch of people that probably lived the opposite direction.

10:21.200 --> 10:25.520
And the boat was so far away from the Hilton.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.520
Yeah.

10:26.520 --> 10:30.640
And so are all the other hotels, like if you're at the Marriott and you walk from the boat

10:30.640 --> 10:33.680
to the Hilton, you're going to be mad walking back.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.680
You'll be mad walking to the Hilton.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.680
Yeah.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.520
No, they were, they were mad.

10:39.520 --> 10:43.960
Nick Rutherford, a new Rick and Morty writer, he, at one point he got on one of those scooters

10:43.960 --> 10:49.960
and, uh, and that was, he kind of, he, he tried to make things better by, he was doing,

10:49.960 --> 10:54.840
he was buzzing us as a, with millennial, uh, quotes, like he was just, it was, he kept

10:54.840 --> 11:00.480
zipping by us and then saying, well, he was like saying, it was like lateral stuff.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.960
He was like, I'm a team player.

11:01.960 --> 11:06.200
It was like, it was, it was, it was, it was good.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.200
It was good.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.400
He had a good gig because he could like whiz bias, come up with one and then think about

11:10.400 --> 11:12.280
it and do it, come back.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.280
And it was perfect.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.280
It was like a great bit.

11:14.280 --> 11:16.280
I, I was really excited.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.280
Uh, yeah.

11:17.280 --> 11:22.840
And I, I, I, I made some new friends and I talked to a lot of, uh, fans and I, I was

11:22.840 --> 11:28.720
like, I was really, I felt, I felt more like mirroring, more in the moment.

11:28.720 --> 11:33.400
If you encountered me in San Diego, I don't know if you had more of a powerful thing

11:33.400 --> 11:38.480
than in a day when I was less in the moment and worried that you were going to, uh, hurt

11:38.480 --> 11:39.480
me or something.

11:39.480 --> 11:45.040
And I, I felt like I had more intimate conversations with, uh, with the people I talked to.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.880
And there were a lot of people, for instance, say, you know, like, not a lot of people,

11:48.880 --> 11:53.600
but the proper like fraction of people going, like mentioning my workout on the Instagram

11:53.600 --> 11:58.560
and how they've been watching it and, and, and, and rooting for it or whatever the, whatever

11:58.560 --> 12:00.120
you want to say about that.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.240
People saying like, Hey, are you going to do another Whiting Wong?

12:02.240 --> 12:03.240
I'm like, I don't know.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.240
Should I?

12:04.240 --> 12:05.240
I don't know.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.240
Four more people asked them.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.240
I'll do it.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.240
And then a fourth person asked, but it was Jessica Gao.

12:08.240 --> 12:13.680
I ran, I ran into her and I was like, um, uh, yeah, I was like, maybe we should, she, she

12:13.680 --> 12:16.760
suggested, well, why don't we, instead of thinking about whether you do another season

12:16.760 --> 12:20.640
of Whiting Wongs, why don't you do like, why don't we just do one-offs, like, like, what's,

12:20.640 --> 12:24.840
what's the harm of just getting together and doing like an episode, haven't you whited

12:24.840 --> 12:25.840
all the Wongs?

12:25.840 --> 12:29.000
Well, that's the thing is that's why I wanted, I was like, well, we're talking in circles

12:29.000 --> 12:32.160
and I, I, there's a point where it's actually distracting, right?

12:32.160 --> 12:33.160
Yeah.

12:33.160 --> 12:37.480
But, but I think, I think, I think enough Wongs have, I think there's, I think there's

12:37.480 --> 12:38.880
some, yeah, racial equality has been restored.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.280
Yeah, it's exactly.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.280
Yeah.

12:41.280 --> 12:42.280
Yeah.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.280
Yeah.

12:43.280 --> 12:47.560
Where are, all right, well, that's I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

12:47.560 --> 12:48.800
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
Like the robot-

12:49.800 --> 12:50.800
It didn't get, it didn't get power-

12:50.800 --> 12:52.900
Bring the mic up a little bit.

12:52.900 --> 12:53.900
I think the mic's a bit low for you.

12:53.900 --> 12:54.960
I think the mic's a bit low.

12:54.960 --> 12:55.960
Yeah.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.440
Bring it, bring it up a little.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.840
Operate your microphone.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.280
Stand.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.700
With one hand.

13:04.700 --> 13:13.780
Now, that's a microphone.

13:13.780 --> 13:17.820
How does that feel for you?

13:17.820 --> 13:25.660
Why is this the first time in like eight years that this has been important?

13:25.660 --> 13:30.100
You're almost there.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.300
Try her out.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.700
Take her for a spin.

13:33.700 --> 13:36.140
Take the tires.

13:36.140 --> 13:39.140
Hello.

13:39.140 --> 13:42.300
It's so funny now.

13:42.300 --> 13:45.540
Having so many flashbacks to the first day I combed my hair in seventh grade.

13:45.540 --> 13:48.100
I was thinking the same thing.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.140
You were all there.

13:50.140 --> 13:55.100
Your applause was as hurtful then as it is now.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.340
Look who's showered.

13:56.340 --> 13:57.980
We told you you'd love it.

13:57.980 --> 13:59.980
You smell great.

13:59.980 --> 14:02.900
Steve Levy in the vodka.

14:02.900 --> 14:03.900
Ice bucket.

14:03.900 --> 14:04.900
All right.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.900
Well, let's bring out our guest.

14:06.900 --> 14:10.780
Very old friend of the podcast.

14:10.780 --> 14:13.620
Haven't been talking to him enough lately.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.980
Needs no introduction really.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.940
You sound so good right now, man.

14:18.940 --> 14:21.660
That's like your hair's been combed.

14:21.660 --> 14:30.740
Your shoes are tied.

14:30.740 --> 14:33.420
Your mic was too low, bro.

14:33.420 --> 14:34.420
For eight years?

14:34.420 --> 14:35.740
No, just today.

14:35.740 --> 14:36.740
Today.

14:36.740 --> 14:39.740
It was too low.

14:39.740 --> 14:46.540
I mean, I just, yeah, well, so you look great.

14:46.540 --> 14:48.060
All right.

14:48.060 --> 14:54.820
Well, please welcome our friend, cousin, statesman, brother, Duncan Tressall.

14:54.820 --> 15:15.900
Oh, yeah, I know the music sounded like your job was now to throw a knife at a woman and

15:15.900 --> 15:16.900
miss.

15:16.900 --> 15:35.700
You sounded very like, please welcome the enigmatic professor blade, but it's magic.

15:35.700 --> 15:36.900
It's magic.

15:36.900 --> 15:40.100
I follow you into the light and kill you again.

15:40.100 --> 15:45.100
I don't think there's a more unimpressive way to describe that trick than missing someone

15:45.100 --> 15:46.100
with a knife.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.100
It's so negative.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.100
I mean, I love it.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.100
It's amazing.

15:49.100 --> 15:58.100
It's like William Teller, just like some asshole, oh, he missed his kid.

15:58.100 --> 16:01.500
I guess that's when they brought the balloons in there, like, can I, can we put this in

16:01.500 --> 16:04.020
a positive way in the press release?

16:04.020 --> 16:11.220
He hit a balloon, yeah, asterisk that was really close to a lady, right?

16:11.220 --> 16:15.100
So did he miss the lady because I'm not coming to see the show if he didn't miss the lady.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.100
Yes, sir.

16:16.100 --> 16:20.980
He missed the lady, but we want you to know that he's a proactive knife thrower.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.460
He doesn't just miss things.

16:22.460 --> 16:25.740
Okay, because I was going to say I could miss a lady with a knife.

16:25.740 --> 16:27.500
I've been doing it for 30 years.

16:27.500 --> 16:33.500
That's called marriage.

16:33.500 --> 16:38.340
Sir that that that weird forest donkey laugh doesn't doesn't doesn't make your inherent

16:38.340 --> 16:41.900
misogyny any any any any any lighter.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.620
I thought I thought it did and I'm a paying customer.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.260
You're going to let me let me in.

16:46.260 --> 16:48.580
Let me into your knife show.

16:48.580 --> 16:49.580
We're standing out.

16:49.580 --> 16:52.380
I'm standing on a sidewalk outside the theater where the knife show is happening.

16:52.380 --> 16:53.380
That's what you don't know.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.380
All right, let's move on.

16:56.380 --> 17:03.140
Yeah, what's new in duck and truffle man, like a couple staples.

17:03.140 --> 17:04.140
What do you mean?

17:04.140 --> 17:05.140
Oh, I had a baby.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.140
Yeah.

17:06.140 --> 17:07.140
I got a little baby now.

17:07.140 --> 17:08.140
Yeah.

17:08.140 --> 17:09.980
Thank you.

17:09.980 --> 17:15.140
That applause is that that that's rolling that's the rolling applause of people who really

17:15.140 --> 17:20.820
respect the Duncan trestle kind of brand because they're like, should he have a kid?

17:20.820 --> 17:22.980
Oh, is that what that was?

17:22.980 --> 17:27.100
Yeah, well, they're like, I think he maybe should, but should he I don't know.

17:27.100 --> 17:33.540
It's different from like, I mean, Bill Cosby, well, yeah, he had a kid is America's dad.

17:33.540 --> 17:34.540
Look how that turned out.

17:34.540 --> 17:35.540
Jesus Christ.

17:35.540 --> 17:36.540
I'm not.

17:36.540 --> 17:37.540
Well, I can't.

17:37.540 --> 17:39.420
First of all, I'm getting so insecure up here.

17:39.420 --> 17:40.420
Really?

17:40.420 --> 17:44.100
I'm still stuck on the brain donkey laugh with you are making fun of my life.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.100
Now you're comparing me.

17:45.100 --> 17:46.100
No.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.100
No, I was a no, I'm never making fun.

17:48.100 --> 17:52.780
I don't have time to make fun of other people.

17:52.780 --> 17:53.780
I can't.

17:53.780 --> 17:57.140
I can't even see you through my ass lining.

17:57.140 --> 17:59.820
I'm wearing my own sphincter as a blindfold.

17:59.820 --> 18:00.820
I.

18:00.820 --> 18:01.820
Wow.

18:01.820 --> 18:02.820
Yeah.

18:02.820 --> 18:06.980
I was, you know, my wife actually asked me today if I had a prolapse, like if my asshole

18:06.980 --> 18:11.620
fell out in the bathroom, would I call for help for this?

18:11.620 --> 18:12.620
This is a hypothetical.

18:12.620 --> 18:13.620
Oh, if you did.

18:13.620 --> 18:14.620
Okay.

18:14.620 --> 18:15.620
Okay.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.660
Like, yeah, like, you know, the question was like, if you had an approach, like if your

18:17.660 --> 18:23.580
rectum fell out, would you call for help or would you be too embarrassed?

18:23.580 --> 18:30.900
And I said, I would fucking hang myself with it because I would call for help to anybody

18:30.900 --> 18:32.340
that was an earshot.

18:32.340 --> 18:36.220
I would get a plunger and try and just stuff it back in.

18:36.220 --> 18:42.500
A blender, a plunger, a blender, now a blender now that could be something don't don't.

18:42.500 --> 18:47.060
Vitamix your prolapse is or is approach it.

18:47.060 --> 18:51.620
Never use a blender to get your prolapse asshole back inside your body.

18:51.620 --> 18:53.740
That's just a that's just a fool's errand.

18:53.740 --> 18:54.980
I don't know.

18:54.980 --> 18:55.980
Is this prolapse?

18:55.980 --> 18:56.980
Ain't his thing like just something.

18:56.980 --> 19:02.940
This is just a thing that that that that people started happens to 30 and 40 it's like elephant

19:02.940 --> 19:07.060
tight is like in breakfast club like it's like a thing that's like technically possible

19:07.060 --> 19:09.260
but it's not like a common.

19:09.260 --> 19:13.060
It doesn't just happen to everybody like kidneys happens all that happens to one out of three

19:13.060 --> 19:15.660
people that your ass will just falls out of your ass.

19:15.660 --> 19:20.340
It could happen to you tonight then yeah will happens more on the full moon.

19:20.340 --> 19:25.060
Look everybody in the audience look to your left and then look to your right.

19:25.060 --> 19:31.260
Both of those people for prolapse anus is is it a thing that just happens randomly or

19:31.260 --> 19:33.140
is it associated with age?

19:33.140 --> 19:46.580
Does your it's vaccine related vaxxers take heart vaxxers yeah I mean a lot of people

19:46.580 --> 19:51.100
think that the pediatricians are making money off the vaccines but it's not the case.

19:51.100 --> 19:56.500
It's the pediatricians are usually connected to proctologists if you do they're getting

19:56.500 --> 20:01.300
kickbacks from the kickbacks from the proctologists yeah so blast them with a vaccine within a

20:01.300 --> 20:07.020
month their asshole falls out you know the whole story classic yeah that's that's part

20:07.020 --> 20:13.020
of your recent Washington Post piece about prolapse assholes and yeah pediatricians yeah

20:13.020 --> 20:17.220
I'm in a lot of danger probably yeah yeah you're gonna get murdered well no people

20:17.220 --> 20:23.940
came to shoot me with vaccine darts it's fucked up man then nobody will take you seriously

20:23.940 --> 20:27.420
they'll go oh he wrote this article because he has a prolapse anus and he's trying to

20:27.420 --> 20:33.060
make it part of something other than him being a real schnook oh so you're gonna call me

20:33.060 --> 20:38.220
a schnook because my asshole fell out I'm just saying like a stigma against people who

20:38.220 --> 20:43.940
have that you're you're very life partner brought up the question like if it happened

20:43.940 --> 20:48.780
to you in your own bathroom would you even call my name or would you be so embarrassed

20:48.780 --> 20:53.780
that this fate befell you that you would simply try to stuff it back up there like a Kleenex

20:53.780 --> 21:01.460
with a plunger I mean so shit so don't don't don't look at me as the source of the of the

21:01.460 --> 21:08.820
of the shade over prolapse anus re I I welcome it well I mean it you did call it anus re

21:08.820 --> 21:14.500
it's you don't even mean to do it but there's a lot of stigma attached to prolapse does your

21:14.500 --> 21:20.100
partner often give you weird hypothetical situations like that or is that the first one

21:20.100 --> 21:27.300
or like oh no she gets she's she'll like the other day she texted me because like I had

21:27.300 --> 21:31.900
it like I've been very busy lately so I had like a day off she's like just relax just relax

21:31.900 --> 21:36.420
and like see if you know you could just chill out today and like within two seconds the next

21:36.420 --> 21:42.340
text was if we get a home invader you know we have to fight for our love yeah no matter

21:42.340 --> 21:51.660
what because they'll just kill us anyway what it was is she just hanging her weird anxieties

21:51.660 --> 21:57.100
on you like just like let them like hang them out to dry because you're done well no I think

21:57.100 --> 22:01.540
she's gotten sucked into one of these mommy groups and it's like because after you have

22:01.540 --> 22:06.420
a baby there's all these mommy groups is what they're called so it's like mom's like sort

22:06.420 --> 22:12.420
of like support groups for having children people who just had a baby which is like incredibly

22:12.420 --> 22:17.620
painful for the man for the woman it's not so bad they fake it's a different study but

22:17.620 --> 22:23.620
they have to they have to meet in mommy group they have like online mommy groups and I think

22:23.620 --> 22:27.420
somewhere in there some probably they were talking about that your asshole can prolapse

22:27.420 --> 22:33.500
when you have a baby it probably triggers I mean probably every instinct possible regarding

22:33.500 --> 22:37.580
anything dangerous that can ever happen I think that's safe enough to say that we see

22:37.580 --> 22:45.140
that in bearers of our nation's children like they through the eyes of those of us that

22:45.140 --> 22:51.060
are childless like it's pretty easy to recognize that having a child changes you and not in

22:51.060 --> 22:56.220
ways that are fun for the childless because everything is becomes about like that's a

22:56.220 --> 23:03.420
pretty sharp corner of a electrical outlet like that's right like and just beyond that

23:03.420 --> 23:08.660
I mean because that's understandable definitely cover your electrical what brand of baby did

23:08.660 --> 23:16.660
you have boy girl we had a boy a boy yeah brand we had a Costco boy yeah it's great

23:16.660 --> 23:22.260
now it's wonderful but yeah you do go for you can't you have if you like watch an episode

23:22.260 --> 23:28.460
of preppers and you will see peak that's what authentic doomsday preppers called doomsday

23:28.460 --> 23:34.140
preppers preppers no you've seen the show preppers yeah we're on a last name basis with the act

23:34.140 --> 23:39.900
of doomsday prepping that's how prepped we are like you have to abbreviate it because

23:39.900 --> 23:43.740
yeah because this fucking doomsday is coming preppers like what else are you prepping for

23:43.740 --> 23:52.260
a fucking salad no doomsday everyone's first course but it happened that's like you will

23:52.260 --> 23:56.140
you can become a prepper if you have a baby pretty easily and you could see you could

23:56.140 --> 24:02.340
see how it goes yeah you're just like how does your prepping like walk us through a new

24:02.340 --> 24:06.740
father's prepping like what do you do well I can't break that or all in half and put

24:06.740 --> 24:12.780
it in my pocket anymore I have to put it back in the bottle because the baby might reach

24:12.780 --> 24:17.060
in with its little sausage fingers you can't have first of all thing is like if you in the

24:17.060 --> 24:23.260
old days I was like a walking yeah you know I like wild animals pick up seeds in the forest

24:23.260 --> 24:28.860
that's what I was with drugs just in my pockets like you know in your hair you're like oh fuck

24:28.860 --> 24:34.580
take a bag of ketamine holy shit so you can't you know what I mean you can't do that you

24:34.580 --> 24:40.460
can't have you can't have any there can be no so that your doomsday prepping for your

24:40.460 --> 24:46.580
baby is just not having loose drugs hanging about the silo Simon out of your beard in

24:46.580 --> 24:51.620
case it wants to kiss you you can't do it anymore so that's a pragmatic approach and

24:51.620 --> 24:58.260
then and then you know what am I what am I gonna do fucking like build a arc or something

24:58.260 --> 25:03.340
I could now I don't I don't have the discipline I'm to do that kind of thing you're gonna

25:03.340 --> 25:09.940
have to build an arc but that's what someone told someone a long time ago and look what

25:09.940 --> 25:17.500
happened you're not gonna have to build an arc trust me but name one other guy that had

25:17.500 --> 25:21.940
to build an arc name one other person that had to build an arc you mean besides Noah

25:21.940 --> 25:29.420
yeah name one other person well the unicorn as it turns out should have yeah damn didn't

25:29.420 --> 25:34.420
the unicorn didn't he was wearing beautiful suits and having fun hosting shows and then

25:34.420 --> 25:37.700
look what happened to him you know that song they didn't make you sing that song when you're

25:37.700 --> 25:43.140
in grade school yeah the rats and bats and elephants and porpoises too and everybody

25:43.140 --> 25:50.060
didn't give a fuck about the unicorn there's a song but I'm sad fucking traumatic song

25:50.060 --> 25:54.820
for children that they taught me in my Milwaukee public school was like I was like oh god this

25:54.820 --> 26:01.620
fucking song again like it takes you through the ballad of how the unicorn what once fucking

26:01.620 --> 26:09.700
frolicked along with every other animal and then then this fucking biblical event happened

26:09.700 --> 26:14.220
in the I guess I don't know if the unicorn was I don't know the unicorn was out fucking

26:14.220 --> 26:18.460
around having a good old time and didn't get on the boat yeah is it was it Harry shaping

26:18.460 --> 26:25.740
I don't think any animal deserves to not be on the arc did they not care about dinosaurs

26:25.740 --> 26:32.180
well the don I mean no the problem was at that time the dinosaurs were they were I think

26:32.180 --> 26:38.300
extinct we had our bones planted by the devil yeah the test us yeah the devil planted fucking

26:38.300 --> 26:43.500
giant bones everywhere but the Bible talks about the Leviathan and the behemoth aren't

26:43.500 --> 26:48.220
those like dinosaurs or so those are whales those are pouring both of them yeah well

26:48.220 --> 26:52.620
they're extinct whale you're saying okay those are dinosaurs and they're extinct I thought

26:52.620 --> 26:57.020
that those were the Bible talking about dinosaurs they're like check this out there's a brontosaurus

26:57.020 --> 27:01.220
called behemoth the Bible talks there is no brontosaurus it's a made up dinosaur I think

27:01.220 --> 27:07.820
it's real dinosaurs are made up what they're just you know it I know what oh you're gonna

27:07.820 --> 27:16.220
do the agenda huh okay there was dinosaurs the whole planet was covered in lizards yeah

27:16.220 --> 27:26.780
yeah that makes sense that's how I'd make a planet cover it in giant lizards sure you

27:26.780 --> 27:34.740
know because we've seen them everywhere say when you were high and an atheist did you

27:34.740 --> 27:41.580
hear the thing I heard there was a NPR thing a radio lab thing where they kind of updated

27:41.580 --> 27:48.900
the model of what of the extinction event for dinosaurs and whereas we used to think

27:48.900 --> 27:54.820
it was like meteor hits and cloud of dust goes up blocks out the sun plants die things

27:54.820 --> 27:59.100
that eat the plants die things that eat the things that eat plants die it no it was a

27:59.100 --> 28:10.300
fucking supersonic bullet from the great unknown that shot into the planet at somewhere around

28:10.300 --> 28:19.220
the speed of sound or light and fucking like vaporized so much rock as it jetted into the

28:19.220 --> 28:26.980
planet that the rock vapor filled the atmosphere immediately started cooling turned into a cloud

28:26.980 --> 28:32.620
of tiny glass beads that got so hot as they started falling back to the earth that the

28:32.620 --> 28:37.900
entire planet in the span of two hours got as hot as a pizza oven and every living thing

28:37.900 --> 28:48.580
on earth died from having their blood boiling yeah and it does hold up because because it

28:48.580 --> 28:55.900
is it would otherwise be weird it was some of the best pizza we ever had but definitely

28:55.900 --> 28:59.820
you'd be dead before your blood boiled there's no way you know your blood doesn't you're

28:59.820 --> 29:05.580
like oh god that's jingly I think my blood's boiling but what I still don't understand

29:05.580 --> 29:09.620
those so okay then what because what we always learned is that oh the dinosaurs all die as

29:09.620 --> 29:13.740
a meteor in the sky and I think and then the little the little marmoset comes out that

29:13.740 --> 29:18.300
represents us you know and they show you the film at the museum and it's like that's us

29:18.300 --> 29:25.700
like there's like a little a little thing with big eyes comes out of a log and it's like

29:25.700 --> 29:30.820
what that thing don't act that thing don't got no boilable blood player I think they

29:30.820 --> 29:35.980
said you know what they had adapted well they stayed underground underground because they

29:35.980 --> 29:41.020
were giant lizards are gonna eat them so they learn to live like under the radar but I mean

29:41.020 --> 29:44.700
all right well I don't look I mean it's worth the give it a google this isn't the podcast

29:44.700 --> 29:52.060
to learn stuff I did think of you speaking to doomsday prepping though I think of you

29:52.060 --> 29:56.620
for other reasons other than this but there is this there is it I don't know if you've

29:56.620 --> 30:02.700
heard of this guy and now I can't remember his goddamn name so I can't ask you if you've

30:02.700 --> 30:06.820
heard of him but I feel like maybe you'll remember his name if I describe what he was

30:06.820 --> 30:13.220
a he was like a hacker guy that was like a genius and then he he got like sentenced to

30:13.220 --> 30:17.060
some stuff for hacking early in his life but then he like they let him off because he was

30:17.060 --> 30:20.620
like just a bright kid and they're like don't waste his life let him let him be smart with

30:20.620 --> 30:25.180
computers and maybe he'll now that he's learned his lesson and he like was an early bitcoin

30:25.180 --> 30:30.620
adopter and then he like invested all his bitcoin money into like the style he was just so he

30:30.620 --> 30:36.060
was just like super rich and super autonomous and super smart and then he got really really

30:36.060 --> 30:43.780
paranoid and he uh he was he he he got a house and he dug tunnels under the house that were

30:43.780 --> 30:48.940
going in every direction all under the his entire neighborhood underneath all his neighbors

30:48.940 --> 30:54.260
houses which I always I was like you could just do that fuck I want that's all I've ever

30:54.260 --> 31:01.020
wanted to do is minecraft underneath everybody and just be like like like like I mean I wouldn't

31:01.020 --> 31:04.860
like eavesdrop on you or anything I'd just be like under your house and I'd be like happy

31:04.860 --> 31:10.740
and you'd be happy because you'd be like I love showering and I'd be like I love dirt

31:10.740 --> 31:15.380
and every once in a while I'd I'd grab the pipes like chunking the goonies and chunk

31:15.380 --> 31:20.460
you know what's his name sloth and go like like that and then I'd hear the calamity above

31:20.460 --> 31:26.700
me that would be so fucking weird but the guy and you under someone's house like it's

31:26.700 --> 31:31.740
like Harmony Burra down there he's got but the guy was totally prepping for doomsday

31:31.740 --> 31:35.820
that's why I was digging these tunnels and he was so any but he had some plan that involved

31:35.820 --> 31:43.740
like app development or something and he hired this kid to work for him and he was so dedicated

31:43.740 --> 31:48.540
to no one knowing about his tunnels because what good is a network of tunnels under your

31:48.540 --> 31:52.620
house if anybody knows about him except for all the people he hired to dig them and let

31:52.620 --> 31:57.460
just leave after they were like these are gonna cave in pretty soon bye and he didn't

31:57.460 --> 32:04.220
do anything about them but he this kid that he hired to write his mysterious doomsday software

32:04.220 --> 32:07.540
he put he did this whole thing where he picked him up from an airport he put like a crazy

32:07.540 --> 32:12.300
like Silicon Valley version of a blindfold on him drove him around for three hours took

32:12.300 --> 32:18.140
him to the fucking tunnels gave him a bucket an Xbox and a laptop and said you're gonna

32:18.140 --> 32:23.860
work down here why can't he work at a hotel I don't know I guess he didn't want to literally

32:23.860 --> 32:28.300
know what city he was in maybe I don't know but he didn't dig a hotel he can't dig a

32:28.300 --> 32:34.700
hotel I mean he tried to disastrous results because then like at some point a fire happened

32:34.700 --> 32:41.020
down there I mean the guy had no he was a hoarder and he was you know he was very very paranoid

32:41.020 --> 32:46.420
about the government you know knowing everything he was doing not not that paranoia doesn't

32:46.420 --> 32:52.980
typically apply to like also this is a fire hazard and so he just had stacks of newspapers

32:52.980 --> 33:01.300
and magazines and things and and had this kid living down in his spider dungeon while

33:01.300 --> 33:07.580
he lived upstairs and then the kid texted him like I smell smoke and it might be an electrical

33:07.580 --> 33:12.420
fire and he was like all right then I'll turn off all the lights down there and and then

33:12.420 --> 33:17.380
and then like so then that guy was down there walking through a maze of hoarded newspapers

33:17.380 --> 33:23.260
and burning walls and he probably passed out from smoke inhalation and died one of the

33:23.260 --> 33:28.020
most horrible deaths you can do and the the the guy made it out into the lawn and was

33:28.020 --> 33:32.580
like I think someone's in there in the fire department was like holy shit there's a fucking

33:32.580 --> 33:37.820
prairie dog city under your house fuck anyways do you remember do you know that guy's name

33:37.820 --> 33:48.220
Michael Stipe Daryl Clunt I was close no it's it's it's like Eric DeWitt or something

33:48.220 --> 33:52.740
no man I don't know that guy's name it just seemed like the kind of guy like like that

33:52.740 --> 33:57.340
maybe you're you know you're you're you're you're your congregation and my congregation

33:57.340 --> 34:02.900
they they have a joyful overlap I like to think and then like I but then there's like there's

34:02.900 --> 34:08.500
stuff that your congregation probably thinks about more than than my perception of mine

34:08.500 --> 34:12.220
and I thought that might be one of them that that if a guy was like who was convinced that

34:12.220 --> 34:14.980
the world was ending so much that he dug all these tunnels and then accidentally killed

34:14.980 --> 34:19.980
a dude I thought maybe that was well you know man to what I think when I see these fucking

34:19.980 --> 34:28.020
preppers is why do you want like they want to stay alive after everything ends yeah like

34:28.020 --> 34:32.180
while things are happening they're not that into it they want right you know what I'm

34:32.180 --> 34:37.620
saying so it's like that you look at the life of this subterranean I know I know I know

34:37.620 --> 34:44.860
why why because I'm from Wisconsin that's not why I that's why I know why yeah because

34:44.860 --> 34:51.580
I that's something that I'm coping with in therapy is this insidious compulsive fear

34:51.580 --> 35:01.660
of being a schmuck of being the the the the the mark the rub okay there's so much emphasis

35:01.660 --> 35:09.700
in the Midwest on how you those people in California New York they're crazy they're pretentious

35:09.700 --> 35:15.300
they're delusional they don't understand that you're supposed to have winter for 10 months

35:15.300 --> 35:23.300
and that your car doors was to freeze broken they're not practical people we're practical

35:23.300 --> 35:30.380
people and if you're ever should you ever be caught off guard by your taxes or your medical

35:30.380 --> 35:36.540
payments or anything like that it's like there's a bigger fear of that and I'm only using my

35:36.540 --> 35:47.380
eye statements I'm not if you're from Milwaukee and you're like fuck you I'm fucking cool

35:47.380 --> 35:52.020
but I do think it's like a cultural thing like in the more in the less coastal thing

35:52.020 --> 36:02.620
where you're like I I I I I I'm more afraid of being anyone's sucker than I am afraid

36:02.620 --> 36:10.940
of not living a fun life okay so so like that it's like you that you you can live to 75

36:10.940 --> 36:17.740
in a freezing tundra thumbing your chin that's a Midwestern thing if you do it with your

36:17.740 --> 36:23.540
nose it might break off the the you you can you can die happy going like these yeah but

36:23.540 --> 36:28.220
at least I didn't go to California where those people are crazy they talk to their own hair

36:28.220 --> 36:33.980
they're crazy like like and and so I that's that's I'm not saying this guy's from the

36:33.980 --> 36:40.100
Midwest I'm saying doomsday prepping I totally get it because I when I think about it I get

36:40.100 --> 36:44.420
I'm like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because my biggest nightmare about about turning on

36:44.420 --> 36:49.820
the TV and and and have it have it's gonna well it happened the thing that you've been

36:49.820 --> 36:54.300
thinking might have happened for 40 years because it's like one of many things that might happen

36:54.300 --> 37:00.780
would happen and I don't have the fucking bag of shit I could have bought yeah for 40 years

37:00.780 --> 37:07.100
I'm just gonna be like oh I lost at life yeah when really that's not how you lose it life

37:07.100 --> 37:13.060
you lose it life by living after the apocalypse yeah by living in a shit tunnel with a bunch

37:13.060 --> 37:23.220
of newspapers and smoke and you'd climb out and why it's a it seems like the entire phenomena

37:23.220 --> 37:32.100
is really really tragic not just because the preppers kids like God may you never be born

37:32.100 --> 37:37.820
to a family of preppers it's the fact that those people should what they say is gonna

37:37.820 --> 37:43.780
happen happens that's the those are the going to be the people who create the next human

37:43.780 --> 37:50.180
race well I mean that and that resonates with like our our model of like Australia and America

37:50.180 --> 37:55.780
like we we often refer to that as if there's like maybe a oh you know you know why Americans

37:55.780 --> 38:02.860
are obsessed with tits and guns is because it's part of our like genetic socio psychological

38:02.860 --> 38:07.660
like thing that we were like where we run from things and panic more easily because back

38:07.660 --> 38:14.300
in the day when traveling the Atlantic was 70% lethal yeah like it actually created a

38:14.300 --> 38:18.460
filter of the kind of people that had children from which people are descended and actually

38:18.460 --> 38:22.980
it's the some people will make the argument that like Australians and Americans are like

38:22.980 --> 38:28.140
we're different like in our psychology in our culture because it's like we're descended

38:28.140 --> 38:38.860
from from crazy people oh you mean like yeah like we have some kind of like genetic survival

38:38.860 --> 38:43.420
weirdness or paranoia I think paranoia is like probably the better way to talk about

38:43.420 --> 38:48.780
it yeah well for sure I mean definitely paranoia I mean in anger a lot of it a lot of anger

38:48.780 --> 38:54.660
I mean the country's been at war for what is it 93% of its history now 94% of its history

38:54.660 --> 39:00.540
hours yeah I think it's 93% someone out there probably knows 93% 94% of our history been

39:00.540 --> 39:05.740
at war now they're finding out trauma gets encoded in your DNA there's epigenetic trauma

39:05.740 --> 39:11.060
so even if you didn't go to war if like your grandfather went to war and he did hello there

39:11.060 --> 39:18.060
you go hey yeah great so it gets stuck in you yeah good job well that's cool because

39:18.060 --> 39:22.500
I didn't really talk to my grandpa's as much as I should have given that they fought Nazis

39:22.500 --> 39:26.700
well you basically did with your genes yeah now I can be like you know it's a hard it's

39:26.700 --> 39:33.300
a hard war yeah I'm gonna go out back and take a photo of me smoking a cigarette on

39:33.300 --> 39:39.340
a tank yeah I always feel like the doomsday preppers are the worst off because it's not

39:39.340 --> 39:42.780
like I guess there's some of them who do it secretly but like if anyone knows you're

39:42.780 --> 39:46.980
a doomsday prepper that's the first place I'm gonna fucking go to it's like you probably

39:46.980 --> 39:51.300
want to like if someone has like a crazy house full of water it's like I'm gonna go shoot

39:51.300 --> 39:55.140
that place up you're not gonna do that you're not gonna shoot up a place I'm just thinking

39:55.140 --> 40:00.460
of like the masses that are that are looking for in haven't I'm gonna go straight to dance

40:00.460 --> 40:05.380
place I might yeah me too that's my damn when it all falls to shit I'm going straight

40:05.380 --> 40:08.860
to dance place because he has a gun he doesn't know how to work he's got all the water he's

40:08.860 --> 40:15.460
got he's got all the water he'll he'll point a gun that's not the safety on he doesn't

40:15.460 --> 40:20.500
know how that fucking thing happens and I'll just go movie hey look I live here now and

40:20.500 --> 40:25.860
we're gonna have and then I'm gonna take your gun I'm gonna show you how to work it oh and

40:25.860 --> 40:33.740
then kill you that kind of shit what a roller coaster ride yeah I went into a when I when

40:33.740 --> 40:37.540
we were shooting this show when I'm shooting the show Joe Rogan called Joe Rogan questions

40:37.540 --> 40:44.660
everything we were like it was a very funny show because he because he never questioned

40:44.660 --> 40:54.980
Joe Rogan admit it knows like we both went into the show I know I did we both went into

40:54.980 --> 41:00.020
the show with a kind of like I really thought maybe we're gonna fucking find something I

41:00.020 --> 41:03.620
remember you telling me about this because you and I like seems like a different world

41:03.620 --> 41:09.420
but we were briefly talking about like developing a thing yeah yeah yeah that's right like where

41:09.420 --> 41:15.340
you go and you were like I just did that and it's like it didn't well it was it was because

41:15.340 --> 41:20.300
if you want to treat you Art Bell does it really in a perfect way or he did in a perfect

41:20.300 --> 41:26.740
way wait did he died right unfortunately Art Bell passed yeah anyway he did he like would

41:26.740 --> 41:32.340
just let people talk about the story he doesn't question it whereas like Rogan over the course

41:32.340 --> 41:38.380
of the series began to realize like oh yeah when it's not of course it's not it's not

41:38.380 --> 41:42.940
out there we're just meet we're meeting with people who are like saying they have alien

41:42.940 --> 41:49.500
seeds and planted in them and stuff and but anyway we ended up in a underground subterranean

41:49.500 --> 41:57.980
limestone cave I ended up there metaphorically no creatively yeah that too but called reality

41:57.980 --> 42:05.380
telling yeah but it was a kid it was like an as a limestone gave the government had used

42:05.380 --> 42:10.220
a store shit and then this guy bought it and he was renting out space where you could park

42:10.220 --> 42:17.100
your RV down there and you realize like once the doors shut right the blast doors shut

42:17.100 --> 42:25.260
and it locks that guy becomes yeah king I saw a thing you remember you telling me about

42:25.260 --> 42:29.180
that is like let's try they put a tricycle out there because they like worries of it

42:29.180 --> 42:34.460
it's like oh the future of tomorrow thing and it's like oh god no like Lord the playground

42:34.460 --> 42:38.500
that underground yeah like remind me that I'll be coming in with a child when there's

42:38.500 --> 42:44.580
no law and I'm still who I am that's right and can't do a sit-up much less stand up

42:44.580 --> 42:49.980
to the guy who had the foresight and biceps to dig a hole I'm living in now that's right

42:49.980 --> 42:56.940
here's my toddler take care of her I'm gonna go hunt for frozen pizza yeah I hope nothing

42:56.940 --> 43:04.580
untoward happens as you create a new society with my mosquito coast the anyways the mosquito

43:04.580 --> 43:08.420
coast you gotta watch that movie it's amazing I think it's actually really relevant now

43:08.420 --> 43:14.540
and it's Harrison Ford so you can be into it that's before he was so sleepy like he

43:14.540 --> 43:20.060
was still he still was like looking forward to stuff like you could tell he was like I

43:20.060 --> 43:24.260
don't know maybe I'll be King Lear I don't know it was before that point where he was

43:24.260 --> 43:30.540
like I can't everyone gets mad when I complain he crashed a plane on a golf course and brilliantly

43:30.540 --> 43:36.260
it was all doctors were golfing that day and he crashed a plane and it was just a bunch

43:36.260 --> 43:44.620
of off-duty doctors that saw to Han Solo that's fucking there there was a there I clicked

43:44.620 --> 43:50.540
on this YouTube video that was a tour of like something like it was like the headline was

43:50.540 --> 44:00.100
like take a tour of the world's most expensive bomb shelters or something something caught

44:00.100 --> 44:03.620
my attention it was like I don't think I'm the most expensive or they just named the

44:03.620 --> 44:08.380
price like for $1 billion you could live here after the apocalypse or something and it was

44:08.380 --> 44:16.820
like an abandoned military missile silo so make sense you're like oh wow cool where do

44:16.820 --> 44:24.220
you want to be in the event of something horrible oh a re decommissioned place where they actually

44:24.220 --> 44:28.020
thought people were gonna be sitting and pushing the buttons that was nucleating the world

44:28.020 --> 44:31.940
like like probably a good place to start with your little Lord of the Flies fantasy

44:31.940 --> 44:38.260
the best Airbnb but it was so it was it was like the whole thing was like the intro of

44:38.260 --> 44:41.780
it the description of it was sort of like this is for rich people this is for rich people

44:41.780 --> 44:48.580
and it was like it was so depressing it was almost therapeutic because you're like yeah

44:48.580 --> 44:57.580
it like richness in the apocalypse is going to buy you literally the right maybe kind

44:57.580 --> 45:04.860
of to pull up to the entertainment weekly party of having been promised that your billion

45:04.860 --> 45:10.220
dollars is still worth anything yeah what's the currency at that point what is gold worth

45:10.220 --> 45:15.220
I swear to you I was like I when I thought about the day of like say you own you have

45:15.220 --> 45:19.020
because it's like a timeshare thing or like I want to not timeshare but like a condo kind

45:19.020 --> 45:25.460
of thing where you own a segment of this vast underground place and it was impressive in

45:25.460 --> 45:31.740
terms of its like I ability to keep people rich people alive for 100 years I'm it but

45:31.740 --> 45:37.500
it was a it really opened your eyes to like oh my god if your only goal is to live and

45:37.500 --> 45:43.380
you spend all of your money on that goal it's it really looked like hell when you thought

45:43.380 --> 45:47.900
about you're looking at the place like we have and here's our wine cellar or like you

45:47.900 --> 45:54.300
know they would and it was like yeah but it's not you can't buy like making an underground

45:54.300 --> 45:59.900
thing and feel like freedom which is not wild and and and then and you just kept imagine

45:59.900 --> 46:04.660
I kept while I was watching the video and I just kept imagining like we can't have an

46:04.660 --> 46:09.500
election without tearing each other's throats out we can't we can't have a 12 12 angry men

46:09.500 --> 46:17.660
can't decide on a on a verdict yeah without fucking drama happening I life every life

46:17.660 --> 46:25.700
raft has a movie about how we're really just animals as it's subject like we can't I can't

46:25.700 --> 46:31.940
imagine voluntarily getting in my station wagon because the mushroom claws are happening

46:31.940 --> 46:36.300
or the gas got released and I'm like I got my kids that I'm in charge of protecting

46:36.300 --> 46:42.100
and my left one and I'm like let's drive to the to the place where the doomsday preppers

46:42.100 --> 46:47.620
are in charge and meanwhile people in a weird way do that every day they get in their fucking

46:47.620 --> 46:52.540
cars and they drive to the to the we are kind of in a doomsday prepper situation only we're

46:52.540 --> 46:57.220
not underground with the rich people yet we're above ground with the rich people and we're

46:57.220 --> 47:01.740
like trusting that everything's gonna gonna be fine even though it's clearly like people

47:01.740 --> 47:07.500
can I have a friend she can't get her insulin anymore like she just can't get medicine she

47:07.500 --> 47:13.540
has to drive to some place to get the medicines very expensive and already it's where that

47:13.540 --> 47:17.380
thing where you're like well what is worth anything it's like well one of the creepiest

47:17.380 --> 47:22.180
things I have many ever many creepy things about the hot super extreme wealthy but one

47:22.180 --> 47:26.260
of the creepy things was money doesn't mean anything to them anymore because they do favors

47:26.260 --> 47:29.860
for each other because who fucking needs money when you have billions of dollars all you

47:29.860 --> 47:35.500
can do is favors so their currency is a currency of favors and we're the ones who are like

47:35.500 --> 47:39.980
still into money and stuff like that and we're the ones who are hanging our coats on their

47:39.980 --> 47:45.100
benevolence with this crazy idea that it's when everything becomes automated they're

47:45.100 --> 47:49.980
gonna treat us great we'll be fine the people have all the money they love us they'll be

47:49.980 --> 47:53.980
great to us because we're humans and you know they care about humans see how they treat

47:53.980 --> 48:04.060
when the money you paid for the right to bring your biologically viable family into a rabbit

48:04.060 --> 48:09.980
burrow that was dug by a bitcoin investor yeah when the money that you paid him for

48:09.980 --> 48:16.380
the right to a condo in his abandoned missus silo is now officially not worth anything yeah

48:16.380 --> 48:22.620
I'm sure he's gonna be real tactful at the next dinner party like about your wife's

48:22.620 --> 48:29.980
deck deck deck a deck a deck a tillage but like like like the off-color comments that

48:29.980 --> 48:35.820
people make up like like when it's like oh I like I was kind of tacky to say to my girlfriend

48:35.820 --> 48:43.300
as like well wait a minute by tacky do you mean hey you could get beaten up by for that

48:43.300 --> 48:49.540
by the police that I pay for with all of my money in a world where if that doesn't happen

48:49.540 --> 48:54.020
everything's going wrong and like like that it's just like the idea of like being in an

48:54.020 --> 49:01.100
actual situation where it's nothing but fucking just primate rules I'm like I think I would

49:01.100 --> 49:10.820
eat a bullet before we are in that like they like the that's what we're in yeah yeah like

49:10.820 --> 49:15.500
the road the road do you see the road the movie the road yeah it's one of my favorites they

49:15.500 --> 49:20.540
just have like like it's almost like a Brechtian because they don't even bother to try to convince

49:20.540 --> 49:26.140
you anything other than it's just read out the windows and he's having this conversation

49:26.140 --> 49:32.140
with his wife about like which bullets to use with the road I've only read the book

49:32.140 --> 49:37.940
it's a film about that yeah how do you make a movie about that it's just about wandering

49:37.940 --> 49:44.740
and being like well it's just a lot of coughing you just fucking cough blood into a handkerchief

49:44.740 --> 49:50.140
and your kid gets increasingly pale and then I would rather be the guy with the shopping

49:50.140 --> 49:56.380
cart with his son wandering the desolate like wastelands and I'll collide just bullshit

49:56.380 --> 50:01.740
than be the rich people underground I'd rather just take my chances and be mad max yeah that's

50:01.740 --> 50:07.420
what's fun about it not not having a bunker yeah but here's what let's make the apocalypse

50:07.420 --> 50:16.820
fun you guys yeah I think I think what both kind of saying is that is that the rich people

50:16.820 --> 50:22.820
thinking that being underground is going to make it not the shopping cart experience are

50:22.820 --> 50:29.060
so diluted and wasting so much of their energy right now not just because you can grab a shopping

50:29.060 --> 50:35.620
cart from Target right now put it in your backyard and be as prepared for what happens

50:35.620 --> 50:45.340
the day humanity loses accountability as Elon Musk in a fucking Tokyo coffin life at the

50:45.340 --> 50:49.420
core of the earth like who anyone around there is just going to be like he's not looking

50:49.420 --> 50:55.900
he's got a Snickers in his pocket box cutter I think like maybe the first page of the road

50:55.900 --> 51:01.860
by Cormac McCarthy it says like it's a father and a son and I think it might be page one

51:01.860 --> 51:08.020
says each was his other world entire like that that right there is the whole book is

51:08.020 --> 51:14.180
like the idea that if you have somebody that you care for that's that's tragedy the back

51:14.180 --> 51:21.260
story was that the matriarch like she had she had opted out right yeah she just walked

51:21.260 --> 51:25.260
the way she killed herself was she just walked out into it and you were just so certain to

51:25.260 --> 51:30.460
die that she just walked in some direction did she do it to save a bullet no I think

51:30.460 --> 51:34.580
she just gave up she was just sort of like what's the point why are you it's just so

51:34.580 --> 51:41.700
fucking like I it's because it used to be a fun thing to think about and it's like I can't

51:41.700 --> 51:45.900
be scientifically certain whether oh it's not fun to talk about because of our changing

51:45.900 --> 51:50.820
times I could easily also another thing that changes I get older and older I get more and

51:50.820 --> 51:57.780
more I get more and more in love I more and more my hell becomes the idea of of Cody being

51:57.780 --> 52:05.740
hurt so I mean that so I that's that line the first line each was his other world entire

52:05.740 --> 52:13.980
like that the idea that if you care for anything in an apocalypse that's instant tragedy that's

52:13.980 --> 52:20.220
why Spencer is always never he's never been as enthusiastic about my post election very

52:20.220 --> 52:25.260
enthusiastic like oh yeah prepping because you're basically I don't make twine you know

52:25.260 --> 52:30.180
it'll be great yeah making fishing traps but Spencer kind of like fish wait wait what you

52:30.180 --> 52:36.140
know you like you'd use so I've seen these YouTube videos on Facebook I guess they're

52:36.140 --> 52:39.740
Facebook videos you put some you put some pipes in the water and the fish go through

52:39.740 --> 52:44.100
and then you got plenty of fish to eat we had we had a slack channel what kind of we

52:44.100 --> 52:51.060
were using slack to coordinate a secret survivalist colony yeah it was called that babification

52:51.060 --> 52:58.020
and something Spencer at one point kind of like it was like his his is a he's more capable

52:58.020 --> 53:01.580
than any of us like we're like relying on like well Spencer you should learn about ham

53:01.580 --> 53:04.980
radio and you should spend it's like we're all relying on Spencer and then it was like

53:04.980 --> 53:10.820
and Spencer like yeah okay yeah and like I think maybe Cody or somebody probably was

53:10.820 --> 53:16.020
like hey Spencer you are you are you not into this you don't believe in this in this plan

53:16.020 --> 53:20.140
or that plan or you don't agree the thing and you because you were asked a direct question

53:20.140 --> 53:25.340
you answered directly and said I love those you're like well you know I just think when

53:25.340 --> 53:30.380
the shit hits the fan my chances of survival are going to be a lot higher by myself yeah

53:30.380 --> 53:36.740
no that's I truly think I mean that's what all the apocalypse stuff is about it's like

53:36.740 --> 53:40.700
you join a group and then politics happens and suddenly your head's on a spike it's

53:40.700 --> 53:48.020
like I want to just be hiding in the woods catching my fishing pipes get a shopping

53:48.020 --> 53:55.260
cart to try to leave the kid out of it if you can but I think it's funny that we all think

53:55.260 --> 53:58.980
the world ends in a way we need that we're going to be able to go into a subterranean

53:58.980 --> 54:02.500
tunnel I know it isn't a cute that's cute because the it's just going to be some weird

54:02.500 --> 54:07.180
nanogoo that we're going to be in the middle that's going to be like try to get away there's

54:07.180 --> 54:11.340
going to be a nuke aimed to LA and we're going to all just be stuck in traffic I don't think

54:11.340 --> 54:17.500
it's that I think it's going to be what's happening what's happening right now is it's

54:17.500 --> 54:24.540
going to be one one potential way it could end is progressive layers of absurdity that

54:24.540 --> 54:32.620
drive everyone completely insane and that starts off with this like taking you animating

54:32.620 --> 54:37.460
you with an AI and then that AI becomes like a thousand times funnier than you right and

54:37.460 --> 54:41.620
then it starts making its own YouTube videos but then it has an AI that's making its own

54:41.620 --> 54:46.780
YouTube videos and the first you becomes completely irrelevant so you have to deal with this kind

54:46.780 --> 54:53.420
of like my friend calls it a skits off apocalypse where everything just shatters and we all kind

54:53.420 --> 55:00.060
of end up being like lost in this tiny little sentient particles and some kind of technological

55:00.060 --> 55:07.700
kaleidoscope where we've been completely irrelevant ties by AI and then there's no by the time

55:07.700 --> 55:11.340
you get in the tunnel you're like I don't even know if I'm me or and a version of me

55:11.340 --> 55:15.980
that's in a tunnel and then that's I think kind of I think that's what's happening now

55:15.980 --> 55:20.540
why everybody's fuses are blowing and shit right now is because you know their faces

55:20.540 --> 55:25.220
are buried in the phone which by the way that's another thing when you're a parent you they

55:25.220 --> 55:30.140
keep saying like screen time is really bad for children and at the age it's bad for them

55:30.140 --> 55:35.940
keeps going up and up and up and you're like it doesn't stop being bad for you it's bad

55:35.940 --> 55:40.300
for you all the way through keep your kid off of a screen until they're 28 years old

55:40.300 --> 55:48.100
well yeah we're gonna all raise a generation of powders I mean I'm 45 but if I don't crush

55:48.100 --> 55:52.740
the candy who's gonna crush the candy I don't know it's one of the big questions right now

55:52.740 --> 55:59.140
I've been sent here I believe I've been sent here to crush candy you gotta do it someone

55:59.140 --> 56:05.420
has to I think it's right but what you're I think is it's notable that the phenomenon

56:05.420 --> 56:12.020
that you're describing can be seen in an atomic level with with just our general stupidity

56:12.020 --> 56:17.740
the fact that like and I am I'm included in this I'll be sitting at a bar and I and everyone

56:17.740 --> 56:22.780
at the bar that's arguing about some David Hasselhoff reference or what year this happened

56:22.780 --> 56:29.060
or how much money this is everyone all again we just we would rather sit and argue sometimes

56:29.060 --> 56:33.580
some bars have rules they go like you know what the tradition of the bar argument about

56:33.580 --> 56:38.500
the cliff clavin bullshit is so rich and important that the first person that looks at their

56:38.500 --> 56:44.900
phone is an as a traitor to the bar crawling race but it also just happens organically

56:44.900 --> 56:49.820
and not just in bars where it's like look at what we're look at what we would rather

56:49.820 --> 56:56.740
do with our technology and I really don't mean this like in the snobby sense I if anything

56:56.740 --> 57:03.740
I'm kind of like let's really look at the fact that we were we misled ourselves in the

57:03.740 --> 57:07.580
50s and 60s when we started like splitting the atom and writing sci-fi the things about

57:07.580 --> 57:12.420
our brains getting bigger from vitamin dinners and like like to think that we really believe

57:12.420 --> 57:17.940
that that the smarter we're able to get the smarter we're gonna want to get the more information

57:17.940 --> 57:23.340
available to you like even in high school we were like man if this teacher would just

57:23.340 --> 57:28.540
let me use this calculator and then the next year I was like oh you can use your calculator

57:28.540 --> 57:31.620
now because they're everywhere and that's part of the test it's like all right well

57:31.620 --> 57:35.660
now I don't know just take my seat it's that it but what you wanted to do is cheat on the

57:35.660 --> 57:40.780
test with a calculator and then once it all in one day this information is all available

57:40.780 --> 57:45.860
to us we're walking around with an entire movie studio and encyclopedia of all of the

57:45.860 --> 57:53.700
earth's good like knowledge in our pockets and what we use the device for me included is we we go to

57:53.700 --> 58:01.220
social media gatherings and we go hey faggot hey homophobe hey fuck you faggot yeah homophobe

58:01.220 --> 58:05.140
like and we just do it and then and then we'll like cut and paste stuff every once in a while

58:05.140 --> 58:09.860
we'll like bother to google something ago yeah well 20 percent of the you're wrong and it's

58:09.860 --> 58:19.460
like we we we don't want to know we don't want to be gods we don't want to be calm we don't

58:19.460 --> 58:25.460
want to be like like we actively so what you that's like in terms of what you're saying

58:25.460 --> 58:32.420
like that day that that Elon just launched his fucking neuro fiber thing whatever the hell

58:32.420 --> 58:39.220
it's like it's gonna he's like okay so the threads are very small and that's my impression of

58:39.220 --> 58:44.020
him i just is that something that happened or is that hypothetical no he didn't like what's

58:44.020 --> 58:48.020
neuro fiber he did a launch for the it's a it's not it's called a neural link it's like

58:48.660 --> 58:55.300
it's for your brain to compute on yep great it's an interface device that was after that was

58:55.300 --> 59:02.180
after you put a convertible car in space that after he took yeah and as you guys mocked him i kept

59:02.180 --> 59:09.460
saying um anyways but like put a fucking convertible in space best midlife crisis ever man yeah no

59:09.460 --> 59:16.740
shit fucking coolest midlife is any more like apropos metaphor for a male midlife crisis

59:17.460 --> 59:21.060
than being rich and putting a fucking car dude you know it's going to be badass when like in

59:21.060 --> 59:26.420
thousands of years some like happy little alien society is like hanging out and like the car

59:26.420 --> 59:31.620
just smashes through their alien driveway like what the fuck it's like blasted some music it's

59:31.620 --> 59:37.460
got like a mannequin inside no but like the aliens are going to find the car and the aliens that

59:37.460 --> 59:42.180
find the car are going to have listened to their elons and they're going to be like look it's a

59:42.180 --> 59:46.820
car i bet they had an elon and they're gonna be like look at this cool car no there's going to be

59:46.820 --> 59:52.980
like a there's going to be like he's my friend it'll be like if aliens came to earth and they'll

59:52.980 --> 59:57.300
be like there's something inside and it's like oh that's just a mannequin but it'll take like

59:57.300 --> 01:00:01.300
two weeks for them to find that out it'll be like a global incident for these because the

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:06.660
universe will be awesome because mathematically the universe is probably infinite uh there's

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:13.940
going to be a chance that elon must stupid convertible car it's going to run into another

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:20.020
like species car or like yeah i just explained how that would happen there's going to be a

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:25.780
little oh there elon a little a little smash up which is all the more reason to launch all your

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:30.980
garbage cars big so that that accident is between two shitty cars that no one cares about instead

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:36.900
of a bus full of space nuns you've created space nuns you know the mathematical certainty

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:43.220
of douche bags and space like it's going to be as a hero you're not you're not friends with them

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:48.180
you met him we can we circle back to this at least three times at least three times i've met him

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:54.500
that's a friendship he doesn't give a he loves him it's a bromance classic bromance classic

01:00:54.500 --> 01:01:00.660
bromance classic bromance terrific terrific i'm glad you're happy for the classic romance he put a

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:06.660
fucking convertible in space that's jealous you're jealous no it's stupid it's science you know what

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:12.180
they say that mannequins made of what water balloons filled with his jizz i was close

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:17.540
not i think that sounds cool now that's true now i'm back on board now i'm back on board

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:24.420
also uh so the car from the alien species that smashes into him it's going to be a fucked up

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:30.340
mess yeah but that's but i guess jizz would freeze in the vacuum of space eventually sperma sperman

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:36.740
or so is going to freeze and die instantly unless he knows something we don't know that he's going

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:43.220
to crash his car into a uterus like a space uterus it will be yeah that's what he's gonna do man can

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:48.980
we circle back to the insulin conversation oh jeez it was getting so heavy and awful i mean i'd

01:01:48.980 --> 01:02:00.660
rather talk about the musk balloons i just like because musk the musk balloons just because like

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:05.220
because insulin costs a million dollars right do you know how much a balloon of you on musk's

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:12.180
come costs i'm just saying a lot more than insulin man but it only costs like two dollars to make

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:18.180
insulin so that's called like a niche in the let's go hole in the market like we could sell six

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:25.700
dollar insulin and be fucking rich right yeah and why can't we do that we just by eating a candy bar

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:31.620
i know we got to look that's what i've been saying no but seriously like i don't unless like

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:35.940
there must be some sort of what do you call it like mob like medicine mob that's preventing

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.780
people from doing this right because like they are literally they're charging hundreds and

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:44.980

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:32.260
it's a half hour we didn't get paid anything to write that alan thick probably bought a house

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:38.340
with his different strokes lyrics money and their shitty lyrics it's a catchy song it was blared

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:43.780
over loudspeakers into the proletariat's brain for eight years so we can't really actually know

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:49.780
if it's a good song or not if alan thick had to have a sound cloud account then we'd know what

01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:58.100
he's really made of oh that's scary yeah hey everybody it's alan thick i'm coming at you on

01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:02.020
the sound cloud i don't know how sound cloud works do you yeah do you do a sound cloud id

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:10.980
hey everybody it's it's dwayne sound cloud coming at you uh partly cloudy chance of sound

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:20.660
uh here's my latest uh experiment with uh garage bed uh oh wake up wake up wake up wake

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:25.380
up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up boop doop doop doop doop doop his name is dwayne

01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:33.540
you don't have a sound cloud that's i got no sound cloud that's not cool i got no sound cloud i

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:42.980
ain't got no sound cloud let me tell you what day sound comes in a cloud for real god turns his back

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:52.820
on this country and i'll tell you what else uh they tell me they tell me uh oh sir inside here her

01:11:52.820 --> 01:12:03.700
name is alexandria castillo cortez i'm sorry i was just like hooked on that thing where he like

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:07.780
did you see that clip or are you all right whatever i'm not dragging i don't know what you mean the

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:13.060
president the nazi president he had this rally a actual nazi rally in the middle of the country and

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:18.580
was like hey what about these chicks that are like from different places with their cheekbones and

01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:23.780
everyone was like fuck that bird with the stake and he was like i love it and it was like it was

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:29.700
fucking insane because it crossed a huge threshold the people i'm i know everyone understands that

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:34.180
it's fucking like more insanity but do you really understand the threshold that we really crossed

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:41.220
because pre when previous to this anytime anybody was like trying to like be an apologist for this

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:48.580
openly fascist slide we're taking the way that they would apologize for it would be to go um hey uh

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:55.060
i work i have a friend who worked for the clintons and then you have no idea man they were no better

01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:59.540
are they going hey what was obama's thing or any better and it'd be like all these things that

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:07.860
it's like okay i like that was the bent of it was like hey it's uh it looks like a little bit like a

01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:14.740
fascist coup but uh but what do you mean that last thing wasn't fascism come on obama had those

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:23.140
drones um and this was like an actual crossing of a threshold where he was like these elected officials

01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:32.100
in my country that i won an election in that i have no reason to do anything about unless of

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:39.060
course the actual structure of the way things work and maybe it doesn't work for me that good

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:46.260
these ladies represent this thing and they were like invalidate them make them not citizens

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:54.180
take make them go away and he was like worse than i'm gonna say it healer would have been like yeah

01:13:54.180 --> 01:14:01.460
yeah yeah and he was like i love it like he's just lazy and cowardly about it and then two

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:07.460
yeah it was like the the the cowardice is the fucking worst part of it there's i forgive the

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:12.420
americans in the audience who got caught up in a thing look i this podcast has been around long

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:17.140
enough that we we could draw the parallels we were in chicago and a dear friend of mine who

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:22.660
remains a friend of mine to this day i like like said the n-word because i asked him not to say

01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:26.580
the n-word so he thought it'd be a funny joke to say the n-word and in response to him saying it

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:32.020
maybe due to some fucking zeitgeist of energy about people being afraid of their freedom of

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:37.060
speech being turned the crowd of people in a name for theater burst into applause for the n-word

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:41.460
i don't i don't i doubt all of those people were racist and i don't think i'm better than them and

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:46.580
i don't think anybody's worse crowds are allowed to act like fucking animals that's what they do

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:56.340
like it is a fucking horrible unamerican thing to incite that energy and then do nothing nothing

01:14:56.340 --> 01:15:01.460
at all it would be more american to fucking own it and go like yeah you heard me because then at

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:06.820
least you could be like oh yeah he he was caught up in it too he was a little bit american he's a

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:14.180
fucking lazy napping child having a dream about eating his own shit and like the only thing more

01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:20.260
dangerous than anything is anything with a loaded gun that doesn't know it's loaded like he's so

01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:26.020
fucking dumb and cowardly and lazy that he's going to destroy us all anyways so i i just hear you know to

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:32.580
add to that if you want like something that really creeped me out uh as i watched one of

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:39.620
nancy polosis gets put out this awesome documentary about going on the press tour with george w bush

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:45.140
it is really good and it's like all these jaded reporters and they're cool though and they're

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:49.940
just like he's full of shit he's full of shit and then like they're filming george w bush and you

01:15:49.940 --> 01:16:00.020
see man he is so charismatic like he is so incredibly weirdly charismatic that in a weird way he's

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:06.820
like it's like i'm watching it like holy shit man that is some crazy magic he's doing he's like

01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:12.980
you know he's like just winning everyone over everyone's getting won over by this like incredible

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:20.180
weird texas illuminani charisma thing that's like radiating out of him you don't want to like him

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:24.260
you know see i don't know how many people he ended up killing or being part of killing but

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:28.660
i don't know this civilian casualties what a hundred thousand in iraq or something but like

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:34.020
he's like you know just he's like uh yeah see these boots these are they go up here you know

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:41.060
because uh snakebots they're pretty bad i'm gonna kill i'm gonna kill a hundred thousand people

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:48.580
and it's like you know it's like whoa he's but at the end of this press tour he says this thing

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:53.620
to the reporters he's like you know i don't appreciate a lot of what what you said about me

01:16:53.620 --> 01:17:00.100
in the press but i i respect all of you's people and i was like i i was like that that's gone that

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:04.260
used to be that used to be part of the fucking i mean i guess we've become our dads maybe because

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:11.300
now i can't tell the difference between like like oh old people get old and then they go you know

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:16.420
what you used to call boring stodgy stuff now and then you just start deciding well that's

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:20.740
across the line but i don't i don't think that's the case i believe we're in a constitutional

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:27.460
crisis because i believe the previous to this the the fucking left and right margins contained

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:37.860
um uh things like the the the the right for a fucking free press and an actual need for them

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:42.180
like there was this tradition and it was actually part of what disillusioned us i think is because

01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:46.180
it felt rhetorical because well if you really believe that then why are you why are you acting

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:51.060
the way you act why are you bombing this country and then sitting at this correspondence dinner

01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:59.060
and saying uh uh to quote uh jfk uh the the press is right to to defy me it was more about you

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:03.140
know it's it was also rhetorical feeling and it was like oh this all means nothing and i think

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:08.020
that's part of the excitement when someone goes you know what is it me or is all of this just a

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:12.980
bunch of poopy doopies and and everyone's like poopy doopies and they're like like let's see if

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:17.460
it is let's find out if it's poopy doopies and then the and then everyone's like it's not poopy

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:22.980
doopies you will report to detention once and then i'm like what if we didn't ah poopy doopies

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:30.820
and it's a fucking crisis because it turns out ain't no reason it ain't poopy doopies or

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.500
and there ain't nothing to make anyone go to detention and it was actually we were we were

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:39.860
actually being held together with the fucking weird compulsion for rule of law yeah well you know

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:46.420
that creepy thing in the home and there's that great movie funny games where you know what i'm

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:51.700
talking about the original or the ream the american i i thought you were getting game game night wrong

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:57.380
no no no i thought you were like my parents are like what a movie is funny games is awesome

01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:02.100
home and it's about these two kids show up and they're weird in there they're causing problems

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:06.820
oh that oh god that's it yes it's solid but you don't want to believe it you don't want to believe

01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:11.300
that you're getting home invaded so you're kind of like okay okay well maybe you guys are just a

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:16.740
little off and by the time you're like tied up with your husband whose knee is being broken

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:21.060
and then and then you know you realize like oh fuck i got home invaded like this is really

01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:24.980
happening yeah and then you're supposed to spend the rest of your short life as you're being dumped

01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:29.220
into a pond with a cement block tied your neck you're supposed to sit there and wonder your dying

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:33.780
thought is should i have clubbed a random child in the head as soon as he showed up on my porch i

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:38.500
guess i should have been really very hateful and mistrustful that was my big mistake was trusting

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:43.620
people oh gosh darn me i guess that's why i'm dying a horrible death like that's the horrible thing

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:48.660
about evil is the way it spreads is like really should have it's like i'm not touching you i'm not

01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:54.740
touching you you're like anybody that's like been in a car with kids knows like that antagonism has

01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:59.540
its own sentience even the it's like like are you getting mad are you getting mad because

01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:03.860
there's no wrong answer to that question you're either gonna let me keep fucking with you or

01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:07.940
you're gonna blow your stack and prove that i should have been fucking with you well cowardice

01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:13.300
you can't be like p it's not some people i think confuse their their their their cowardice of benevolence

01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:18.020
and it's it's not you're not benevolent you're just afraid and usually the the situation is when

01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:24.420
you're afraid to just cause for a confrontation like they're saying now people watched epstein

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:29.700
flying all these underage kids to his island way after he got convicted there's a ruin you know

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:35.620
news report like the people like i we kept seeing him with these kids and it seemed really bad nothing

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:42.820
happened they didn't they they're they're something i think in a in a person in general gets feel so

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:48.660
little sometimes are so insignificant that you don't want to fight back and so that's we know what

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:55.220
fosters all of the horrible shit that's happening is like in these closed systems where your job's

01:20:55.220 --> 01:21:01.300
at stake you keep a secret and then you're there's blasphemy that can happen in the sense that if you

01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:07.620
say the thing about the person who's supposed to be okay it could destroy oh my god it could destroy

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:14.020
the business the family a you know a religion or whatever right so a sensible person does nothing

01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:19.220
but yeah that's what i'm saying yeah i'm not being ironic saying that it's like a sensible person

01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:25.140
does less than a less reasonable person well you are saying antagonism has like its own

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:30.740
sentience or spirit in the same way this level of i think um turning your back on a thing even

01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:36.100
though it's clearly happening right in front of you it has its own spirit too and and and when

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:43.140
you when you realize that there's people who literally thrive on that reality and not not

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:49.220
exploit it i mean this is like a con artistry is find a person you know they want to be nice

01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:53.300
that's the first mark against them is like oh shit they're just afraid and they think they're

01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:58.580
good people so i'm going to come to them i'm going to like hypnotize them get them invested

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:03.460
in whatever my bullshit is and then i'm just going to you know turn them into my slaves humiliate

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:07.540
them take everything from them and then by the time i'm done they're going to pretend it didn't

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:11.780
happen because they they're from the midwest or whatever you said they didn't want to be

01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:16.340
rubes so they're going to ignore that they even got fucked with and then that's what produces

01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:22.420
the situation i think where people that take over a cool party by doing a bunch of crazy

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:29.460
fucking shit they had nothing to lose they were not the cool person at the party so kicking over

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:35.460
an ashtray jumping off the roof in your underwear into the pool like it causing the cops to get

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:43.460
called like it didn't those people they don't take risks they only enter win-win situations

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:50.100
they they flow to the lowest point of of of human pathway where they're like well actually

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:57.300
that was like when when when this shit bag was was was running he was constantly blowing that

01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:03.380
horn because he would go i don't think i'm gonna win because probably everyone else is cheating

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:09.860
but if i do win it's because i'm awesome and it was like like oh are you sure you don't want to

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:15.060
cover a couple more bases you fucking three-year-old like really you don't want to stick your neck out

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:19.300
a little bit like as much as you did when you tried to sentence five black kids to die in the

01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:23.700
fucking whatever man all right i'm done i'm done i'm done i'm done i mean it's not like we all know

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:27.940
the fight it's like like he's going to win again i'm trying yeah yeah we don't have to we don't

01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:31.540
have to bump people out with that i and i didn't i was like he was gonna win the first time he's

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:35.620
going to win the second time there's no fucking reason to doubt that there's no fucking reason

01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:43.700
this stuff is only valuable to us in as much as it causes us to have conversations that you know

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:49.940
i i obviously you guys have more than enough people talking to you about everything that's

01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:55.140
going on and like i i'm not the person it's not that's why i've been more and more quiet about

01:23:55.140 --> 01:24:01.940
politics with every passing episode because it's like i'm not helping by talking about it and

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:08.340
i had a driver in canada in canada in saskatchewan which is like like the oklahoma of canada

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:15.460
uh it's it's very rural it's very like red steady like if you know like that's the comparison to

01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:23.700
like like it's they hate justin trudeau our driver nice guy funny guy he said yeah he said i want

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:30.420
to shoot him shoot trudeau yeah and i said well you sound like you're from texas he goes yeah but

01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:36.580
in texas they let us they would let you have guns like like they hate justin trudeau because he's

01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:42.180
he's the he's the liberal smart guy that speaks three languages and is charming uh like like

01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:48.180
it's fucking nasty everywhere you go and the idea that you don't think that trump will win again is

01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:54.420
crazy well you know uh i think you're probably right um and i'm sorry were you about to make

01:24:54.420 --> 01:25:00.020
another no no no the end uh we're all going to watch trump get a fucking second term because

01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:04.740
there's no reason to assume otherwise but that's a but i don't want to let you go on that but but

01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:10.980
like that's all but you can say that in a positive way like like like like we we we we all get to

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:15.300
vote our conscience this time around like we don't have to like like let's not get sucked into the

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:20.740
game of like uh made possibly like yelling at our friends about like well you know if you don't vote

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:26.100
for a fucking generic uh johnson then we have no chance of winning it's like it might be an invitation

01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:32.100
to for people to explore new ways of thinking but yeah that's what you're saying that's what i like uh

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:40.100
umma thurman's dad a lot of people don't here we go robert no i'm glad we finally got on this

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:44.660
to get to the conversations that that's what i took us an hour and a half when we finally made

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:49.700
it his there are dads like this really amazing buddhist scholar named robert thurman and he's

01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:53.940
like best friends with the dalai lama and he's written a lot of great books on uh buddhism and

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:59.780
politics and buddhism and activism because people don't realize that the two go hand in hand but

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:06.260
but i was so i love that he named his kid umma because he's so buddhist his kids named him robert

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:16.820
he became a buddhist and his daughter umma actor well he his he was saying that we can't get cynical

01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:21.540
like uh it right now is the perfect time to get super cynical and if you get super cynical you're

01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:26.900
gonna get shut down if you get shut down that's exactly where they want you because they want

01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:34.180
cynical pessimistic shut down people who get so glumified by the current political system

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:39.300
that no one votes you just give up and not just vote in the in the big elections but just vote in

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:45.140
local elections and get really involved in in your community because you can pass stuff

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:50.260
at the state level that creates at least many force fields to in some way or another i mean if

01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:55.460
that shit's not more important than the fucking dumb reality show at the top then we wouldn't be

01:26:55.460 --> 01:27:03.060
alive right now and the guy at the top wouldn't be focusing his fucking nuclear dipshitness on

01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:07.860
local representatives of fucking neighborhoods where they were unduly elected by their own

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:13.860
constituency who probably look and think like them like like like like that it is because the whole

01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:20.580
shtick of thinking locally acting locally is so it is the huge threat you can't you can't stand at

01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:27.380
one of those rallies and make everyone in portland stop making their own cheese i ran out of ways to

01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:34.500
everyone go make their own cheese i don't i i was like that that the those representatives are

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:40.740
like look at the inverse relationship they have they represent something no pun intended like

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:46.340
and and it's it's a it's drawing a thing from that party they're going here's our strategy

01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:52.820
because we have no opposition on the left in terms of like a mecca godzilla to our godzilla

01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:59.460
which is actually a problem for them because if people get fatigued as they very well might of

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:05.060
a fucking autocrat they might just actually find it more appealing for a jimmy carter to just step

01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:11.300
up and be like hey i like the taste of fucking graham crackers and milk i don't need any more of this

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:18.500
shit i'm fucking tired god damn you wore out my racist bone um i i i i i i i didn't tell my mom

01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:25.140
i i pretended i voted for trump but i i secretly voted for jimmy carter because i'm tired of being

01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:32.420
racist i got so racist last eight years it hurt anyways but um like that is why because they you

01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:37.140
could his instinct everyone's like oh it's a distraction for the epstein thing that that

01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:41.220
guy's never done delayed gratification in his life like he doesn't he's not like oh i think i'll think

01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:49.060
one thing and not say it um he what he's doing is very organic and natural he's like i only understand

01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:54.900
fighting and he's like joe biden's not worth fighting if he fights joe biden he looks like a

01:28:54.900 --> 01:29:01.780
fucking dummy he's gonna be like oh sleepy joe it's gonna it's only gonna inflate and so he's like

01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:08.180
these socialists these women of color like he want that their whole camp like is going um

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:17.460
these faces this identity politics is powerful it can displace us and so that's a that's an

01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:24.740
uplifting thought they're scared of it they believe that uh one skywalker can blow up a death star

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:30.100
they are very worried about it yeah i i that's i that's my i mean that's my hope i that's always

01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:35.940
been every that's what we hope for for sure yeah i i i went through a real shitty like dark cynical

01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:41.380
period and then realized i'm like oh this is one of the great things i'll be married my wife was

01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:45.700
like you know you're a hundred percent wrong about all your political predictions because i've been

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:51.620
like just like making but she said that to you yeah and i realized that like yeah a couple of

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:55.780
years ago i've been wrong about literally everything political to realize that like you don't

01:29:55.780 --> 01:30:00.980
understand geopolitics i don't understand geopolitics it's not i just don't know that doesn't mean we

01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:07.460
shouldn't interact with it but the thing i at least have been trying to do is like in my own home

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:15.860
try to not bring that shit in there and then uh this guy chug him trump orempe she says that if

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:20.660
you want to like change society the way you're you're gonna have to do it is maybe the isms will

01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:25.460
work like maybe we can make find a socialism that works a communism that works a capitalism that

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:32.100
works a little elon musk jism maybe jism always works baby always works you gotta pop those musk

01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:37.460
balloons yeah well don't wait you save them oh don't pop the balloons are there to protect them from

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:42.260
the vacuum of space but no the balloons are acting like an airbag why keep the jizz in the musk balloon

01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:47.220
if you don't want to form a lethal cum cloud around the earth it'll instantly disperse in a

01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:52.980
spherical pattern it'll block it'll block the fight him indeed you're one of those musk jizz

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:57.540
hoarders that wants to keep it in the balloon i'm saying let's disperse the musk jizz i would

01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:01.940
like you're a party man but we're thinking about the end of the world you got to get those jizz

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:08.740
balloons down in your bunker wait for a special occasion pop those jizz balloons right now but

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:16.260
that's i think there's a that's the you see i'm gonna pop the balloon man you guys deflected uh

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:22.100
you you you guys want to keep that's your problem Duncan you want to you want to keep the jizz inside

01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:28.900
the balloon sure it's a why because it came from elon musk's dick yeah but you know but what if you

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:34.260
had thomas Edison's jizz i would let i would pop that balloon too you would have made the worst

01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:40.100
mistake of your life you're gonna pop a balloon you're one of those people that wants to hoard

01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:45.540
jizz balloons of geniuses and you want to hoard genius jizz and balloons i would like the woolly

01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:50.980
mammoth to come back right but you would keep it in a balloon and not not you wouldn't you pop that

01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:55.060
jeff the whole point of putting elon musk's jizz in a balloon and launching it into space is not

01:31:55.060 --> 01:32:03.700
so that it surrounds the earth elon can surround the earth with jizz from home we need to get his

01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:10.900
jizz out of orbit where it can pop around okay venus for so you want to pop the balloon eventually

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:15.060
well the balloon i hope will pop on itself okay that that's that's all i'm saying all i'm saying

01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:22.900
but you want to be outside and it starts raining musk jizz i wanted to rain genius jizz all over

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:32.500
my face what do you think this podcast is you've been you've been living in your own paradise this

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:46.020
whole time you're soaking wet baby um i did not to drag it back to the less fun thing and i'm not

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:49.780
i'm not i'm not i'm not doing that entirely i want to actually just get the one fruitful thing

01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:57.060
out of that because what you said suggest that one thing which is it we can it's like it's that

01:32:57.060 --> 01:33:02.100
it's the whole awareness thing and it's this idea of like oh i'm wrong i'm wrong about everything

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:06.980
like like it's and it's okay to be wrong which is like that's why i was like those people chanting

01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:11.460
the thing at a rally like who cares they're a crowd they change to something at a rally the

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:15.940
customer is always right they're americans they have freedom of speech they're allowed to have a

01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:21.540
fucking weird dumb joke get out of control we're not we they don't need to be rounded up and and

01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:27.380
investigated there's a fucking dude right up there in a system that we designed for that purpose

01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:33.220
who has a chance to react to it and chooses the worst fucking possible path through that interaction

01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:40.980
and and so our way of fighting it uh in big air quotes is like is actually just being like oh what

01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:46.420
did i learn from all of this shit last couple years i am for me using my eye statements it's

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:54.740
like i learned that i had a huge intolerance for being out of control for like i like i you know

01:33:54.740 --> 01:34:02.820
like just like it boy was i like fucking addicted to like controlling the fucking world it was crazy

01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:09.460
how unable i was to handle the concept that that that shit wasn't gonna go my way tomorrow and like

01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:16.020
i like i only got a teaspoon of it and i reacted in a way that made all of the women in my life

01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:20.740
all of the people of color in my life frankly which i like like they're like welcome to the party

01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:24.980
and it was like okay that's good because when that line is said and die hard marks the beginning of

01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:33.380
an alliance that saves Nakatomi Plaza and sometimes it has to start with a dead body

01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:37.220
breaking a windshield of a guy that just wanted to have twinkies and i know it's confusing because

01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:44.820
i'm actually the black guy in that metaphor uh i don't know man like you know i i want it to be

01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:51.300
great you know i love the idea of like yeah we can all i love the i'm gonna stay optimistic all

01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:57.620
the way until i'm getting my head chopped off and thank you very much put on a pike now i mean i

01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:02.100
just want to point out you know the the smattering of applause you get when you praise optimism

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:09.940
it's from a bunch of optimists you're right they're easy clappers we've always known this people

01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:16.900
they're easy clappers yeah there they go there they go easy clappers

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:23.860
but hey you can still i'm you get your optimism doesn't mean being weak or optimism doesn't mean

01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:30.180
having to be all like flowery and full of shit or whatever it's like you can you can optimistically

01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:36.580
you know that's that great book man search for meaning by victor franco where he's like in oschwitz

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:44.660
and like within that situation he still finds a way to maintain a belief in like humanity as being

01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:50.420
a positive plus beautiful thing on the planet even in the midst of all that so if he could do it

01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:58.420
i'm certain that that we can do it in this insane revolting and turbulent weird time right now it's

01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:04.180
just i think to for me it just means like i can't do anything about those fucking rallies like i can't

01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:08.900
do anything about that i can't do anything about they kind of hope you'd try i mean that's a whole

01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:16.420
it's as simple as biological physics like that's what a cell any membrane is it's like this uh

01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:22.660
bio lipid uh what's bio fuck i forgot that god damn it's like like cell membranes are just made of

01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:27.940
a thing that is it likes water on one side and it hates water on the other and it naturally forms

01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:35.940
a membrane around a thing it's like it they need to have their rally not to sorry to interrupt but

01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:41.060
i just like like like like if i was sorry i interrupted why did i i don't know i mean i was

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:46.900
like desperately searching for some like nice cap on the shit when it's like i don't know man this

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:51.620
stuff happens super fast look what happened in iran it can happen just like that and all of a

01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:55.220
sudden everyone's getting arrested and the next thing you know shits on fire and you didn't

01:36:55.220 --> 01:37:00.020
do anything is what were you going to do anyway and you're fucked i mean really if you look at

01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:05.380
taiwan as an example of what you're supposed to do and then look at us you see like the difference

01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:09.700
like they understand it enough to know oh we're going to get out there and we're not going to

01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:14.900
sleep and we're going to get shot in the face and we're going to like get beaten by thugs because

01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:21.620
we so don't want to have our freedom encroached upon anymore than it already is and we're kind of

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:28.260
like uh well as long as no one's racist yeah we uh kind of i mean yeah because we haven't

01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:33.140
because we haven't yet hit that point you know tarence mckinnon said that thing where the apocalypse

01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:38.180
is already happening it just hadn't gotten to the united states yet it's like when it's when it finally

01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:43.940
comes then then you know people tend to act because i i do have this fantasy of like shit if we all

01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:50.100
just did go like yellow vest or whatever and we really did it and we went into the streets

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:54.740
and we're like yeah we don't want it anymore and we really started like setting shit on fire and

01:37:54.740 --> 01:38:00.020
really like doing what you're supposed to do when things are really bad i think it would change

01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:05.380
really it would change pretty fast well yeah if everyone did anything yeah change real fast yeah

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:11.620
but that but that's to me that's like if if like you're a lion tamer and and human like all of us

01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:16.740
as a whole are the lion then you want to keep the lion entertaining i guess you want to keep it active

01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:22.100
but you don't want it to remember what it's a lion and we went because the moment that happens

01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:27.860
and people remember oh if we organize and take to the streets should change as fast it's all over

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:34.260
for them usually it's like a bad thing but if you can keep the lion just you know pissed off give it

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:40.420
a couple of swipes let it growl here and there but mostly keep it kind of sedated and busy typing

01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:46.660
and looking at its fucking instagram or whatever then you can just do whatever you want to the lion

01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:54.260
you can fuck the lion you can milk the lion for its sweet jizz and add it to your weird gross

01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:59.620
semen balloon collection and then jeff will come over and pop it i got everybody like everybody

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:06.180
lights up when we get back on that track they're like come on get back to that thing and the

01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:10.740
cynicism is like what caused all the problem in the first place this hopeless sense of cynicism

01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:15.620
which is like nothing i do is gonna matter it's all the same if everyone instead of doing that

01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:20.100
were like i'm gonna do the best possible thing for the situation none of it would have devolved

01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:25.140
but it had done people have thought that for like hundreds of years and it created this untenable

01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:29.300
situation cynical thoughts are there and they should be acknowledged i think that's a huge

01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:33.300
lesson that we that we learned and i was resistant to that message because the last thing i wanted

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:38.260
to hear after the day i learned that i didn't control the world and then i had backed the wrong

01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:44.260
horse and that it was good so you know it was like i was so fucking sick of the fucking think pieces

01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:49.940
about you know i forgot the rust belt but we what we did forget was we forgot we forgot that every

01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:55.700
single person was like it yeah we did we did enter a world where we're like actually like you

01:39:55.700 --> 01:40:00.900
know what there's such a thing as dismissible people and we that was working for us economically

01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:05.700
up to a certain point and then and then it and then it became a thing that you could launch a

01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:10.980
platform off of some fucking dude was like oh all this fucking human flotsam you can actually turn

01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:17.060
that all into one big mac anyways i'm mixing metaphors or maybe not i don't know much about

01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:24.580
big macs but the um i do think that yeah cynicism doesn't need to you don't need to choose between

01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:32.420
being cynical which is the the fucking belief that things are going to tend to go from high to low

01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:42.020
hot to cold yeah like like like cynicism is reality tragedy is a thing that is but cynicism

01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:50.900
causes the inaction but it's like yeah we we it's the the people that the people that are trying

01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:57.540
to trick us into thinking you have to choose between polyanna and nihilism um are they don't

01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:02.020
have our best interests at heart because we've been living this long by finding a way to split

01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:07.940
the difference we know goddamn well that life doesn't mean shit and but we are here because

01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:18.020
people that had bleaker lives than we did um like grabbed their fucking bayonets blenders of

01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:24.740
particle accelerators what their weapon of choice in the war against chaos and they found order

01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:30.340
they they yeah so there's a lot of delusion to being a human i feel like we're fucking monkeys

01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:36.260
that talk it's not worth much if you really think about it which we're the only animal that can and

01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:42.020
so we shouldn't and it's like it's a fucking bummer and so we make up stories and sound clouds and

01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:50.020
stuff to cope with it it is it is crucial to find that middle ground that to to to refuse the temptation

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:56.260
to someone telling you no at the end of the day you're either this or you're that that's the sign

01:41:56.260 --> 01:42:03.060
of somebody that's probably trying to trying to box you in and you can have joyful cynicism like

01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:10.020
the idea like cynicism is so fun like when you hit a nice cynical cynical pitch and you're really

01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:15.700
just fucking just slashing the throat of the world and as long as you just can really enjoy it and

01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:20.980
recognize like this isn't all that i am but god damn if i don't have a nice throbbing vein of

01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:27.140
cynicism pumping through me at all times you get to have your cynicism and you're right when sun

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:33.940
when a son of a bitch at some fucking yoga studio tries to like get you to overcome your cynicism

01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:41.140
like it's bad or something fuck that that's the devil like you start calling yourself yeah it

01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:47.300
it well it's gonna cause don't listen to him you react and this is the most uplifting thing about

01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:53.300
humans is that you react to that with fury yeah if you're feeling like self-loathing or these

01:42:53.300 --> 01:43:00.100
things that we label as unhealthy you're like you say in front of a yoga guy um i'm so such a piece

01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:03.620
of shit i ate a philly cheese steak last night i shouldn't have done that and like like the the

01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:09.460
kind of people that go like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa stop stop stop everything

01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:17.540
think different it is the good part of every american that's like no stop stopping stop

01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:21.780
telling me to let this play out it's archie bunker it's cartman it's gonna fucking flow like lava

01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:26.420
make a mountain and change the landscape like what like let it be over if you truly believe it's

01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:31.540
like fruitless like i'm not suggesting we go into the streets and take care of my fatness with the

01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:39.060
final solution i'm momentarily running out this fucking lobe in my brain that's like i'm a piece

01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:44.820
of shit i fucking fail and there are ways to like grab the person next to you when they're

01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:52.260
you know cody's in that space right now or dog is fucking terribly ill and she's she's she's

01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:57.540
she's she's she's in this awful place and it's like it's almost it's like a drug trip

01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:04.180
coaching kind of thing where i'm like i'm i mean she probably he it's probably isn't working but

01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:12.340
like i i'm always saying to her like you can feel that feeling just don't you just don't act on it

01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:17.380
it's it like it's it's just like yeah it's like like don't argue with people that they're not feeling

01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:22.340
shitty because then they're like fuck you i definitely know i am like you're full you're

01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:27.540
horseshit you're well yeah because people don't want it like you want to one of those liberating

01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:32.340
things i figured out well i didn't figure out so it's a i think it's a buddhist idea something

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:36.420
i chug him tromba talks about a little bit i think this is a safe place for you to just take

01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:41.380
credit for it okay i invented this i came up with a thing called buddhism it's pretty fucking cool

01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:45.860
four noble don't don't call it buddhism you're just gonna get caught up in court for five thousand

01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:54.500
years it's this idea of like uh sometimes things just suck and that's it so instead of trying to

01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:59.300
put lipstick on the suck or trying to like put a little wig on the suck and you're like yeah

01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:04.660
you know like i learned so much from um getting one of my balls chopped off it was really a great

01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:09.700
true story all that stuff it's like which is okay to do it's not to say that you you don't learn

01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:15.060
from your trauma or whatever but a lot of times you'll get around these like trauma cops who when

01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:19.700
you're finally getting to the point of overcoming the guilt you're feeling about being angry whoever

01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:25.220
the the thing was or whatever it was and you're finally feeling this pure anger someone will come

01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:32.340
to you and be like but maybe you should you know zoom out a little bit from the anger and just

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:38.580
understand that there's a way to really love the whatever the fucking thing is you know you could

01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:48.020
just truly and it's like no fuck that it sucked period that's it i had two whole balls yeah i had

01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:54.020
two i know i've had this many i had one it's worse mom gone dad gone you know what i mean we're gonna

01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:58.020
lose everyone everyone's gonna fucking die and for real gonna die and they're gonna die before

01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:02.340
you expect them to you're gonna get a phone call and the person's dead before you expected it it's

01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:06.180
not when you think and you're gonna die before you expect you and the way you die is not the way

01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:10.500
you thought it would be like in the movies where you look like you look like you just got back from

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:17.300
the gym or some shit and you fall asleep no you're gonna become a drooling daughtering thing

01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:23.300
spinning through time sweating profusely confused like i think i'm awake what's where's danny should

01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:30.180
we go to the car leasing station or whatever you're just gonna fucking croak and that sucks

01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:36.500
period just accept that that sucks for me that's been the most liberating thing to be like oh yeah

01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:42.260
it does just get to suck and then within that somewhere there's a sense of like i think i can

01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:48.500
fucking do this optimism shit but i can't do it without the suck first i'm hungry for it now exactly

01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:55.060
exactly i smoked the box of cigars in the closet of like i think there might need not be a god like

01:46:55.060 --> 01:47:00.100
you can't just force feed people yeah like like over and over again like i don't know don't let that

01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:03.780
in your head well that's called you know that's what they call spiritual bypass so it's it's the

01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:09.540
idea is like it's basically like if i put on an outfit like i graduated from college i graduated

01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:16.420
from college but first you have to go through this like just a real swamp of like not good and not

01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:22.660
not good not like movie not good or not not good where there's like gonna be a thing at the end

01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:28.660
of the not good where it's like oh see now we did we did it and now the puzzle pieces fit no it just

01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:34.260
isn't good and that's it and it doesn't get better it's actually called hopelessness and it's really

01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:39.700
one of the most beautiful things ever to finally become absolutely hopeless because uh that means

01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:44.580
that you're not torturing yourself anymore with a fantasy of the way things could be that's pretty

01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:53.860
great and i advise it for anyone to become absolutely completely hopeless but that's where

01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:59.300
optimism starts optimism grows from the soil of hopelessness in the most beautiful way because if

01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:04.980
the universe exists and it was created by a any kind of sentient deity can you imagine how hopeless

01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:10.980
that motherfucker must have been in order to create bother to create hope out of thin air like that

01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:18.500
must have been a sad piece of shit like like who's like like like oh um genuinely absolutely 100

01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:22.420
percent positive that there's no meaning to life at all because here i am and there's nothing if i

01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:27.380
don't do it and then like i think i'll fuck with that because then i wanted hope i want to create

01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:35.300
the idea of mortality right that's that's and so and so you're hopeless he's a serial killer your

01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:40.340
hopelessness is your atonement with the with the cosmic entity it's like whether if you're an atheist

01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:46.180
then that means nothingness your hopelessness is you aligning as raccoons and drafts cannot no

01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:55.380
matter what they tell you your sentence allows you to align with the unliving impersonal cosmic

01:48:55.380 --> 01:49:02.580
bulldozer that was so selfish and shitty and scared and that it made the universe you use the

01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:08.340
those moments when you're when you've got that that gun in your mouth and you don't know who to

01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:14.580
talk to and stuff it's like if you can just scrape that bottom of the pool and just come back up and

01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:20.500
do time just don't do the permanent thing don't don't do the thing that you mean are you talking

01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:26.500
about suicide don't kill yourself yeah that's an easy stance to take isn't it well well i mean yes

01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:30.820
and i know like don't do the permanent thing but the the other for me like the i think suicide

01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:38.500
is man it's a gamble because you are i thought i really just had the easy point of view on this

01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:43.540
no i'm saying like kids if you haven't contemplated suicide you know i would be that would be

01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:48.020
surprising to me so any i think anyone who's sentient and experiencing suffering and wants to

01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:52.340
find exits that's the first thing that pops into your head so i've thought about it a lot and uh

01:49:53.460 --> 01:50:00.020
my conclusion is oh well it's uncertain about what happens upon extinction like for example if we knew

01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:05.460
that we somehow had some way to really show sentience is based on neurobiology and

01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:09.540
when you kill yourself there is a pure extinguishment of all identity it kind of like

01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:15.380
what dockens calls death is the anesthesia that saves us from the pain of eternity stuff like

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:21.220
we get fully put under she's there's no coming back he's um not the band dog oh i was like okay all

01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:26.340
right well i gotta i gotta revisit my done docking you've never heard that docking stuff

01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:34.100
i'm just fucked up damn time warriors i i have to go back and re-listen to that before

01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:40.900
they're uh but you're assuming street three soundtrack they all right continue sorry to me

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:46.740
it's like what if you kill yourself and the momentum of the pain that you're experiencing that drove

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:54.340
you to do self-violence continues into some uh liminal bardo state and that momentum brings

01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:59.620
you into another incarnation then you're just in this never-ending cycle so it was a failed attempt

01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:05.380
it didn't work so it doesn't it didn't solve the problem and so to me that's a good that that definitely

01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:10.180
has kept me from i guess that's an interesting like kept you from what like killing myself it's a

01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:14.340
it's like jesus fucking christ do you know when you jump out the window and you're like

01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:20.340
fantasizing like maybe when i jump out the pavement turns into like a lake or something and i dive into

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:26.260
nothingness how do you know you don't just suddenly come to and you're driving like a metro bus having

01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:32.900
a deja vu or this nature of time and consciousness is so variable that it's the moment that your skull

01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:38.580
impacts with the pavement that actually gets protracted into a subjective eternity yeah like

01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:44.180
exactly some like yeah infinite ketamine like agony moment that goes on and on and on you the

01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:49.300
point is we just don't know and and because of that it seems like or what i've been taught is it's

01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:55.540
better to work on extinguishing the illusion of the identity rather than the physical body because

01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:59.380
the physical body is actually a secondary consideration i wish we had started here instead

01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:03.860
of almost ending here because this is such an interesting thing maybe maybe we both just got

01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:09.700
too drunk but uh the but because what i would i would want to add to that is i'm you're that's

01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:18.500
very interesting and clever to come up with a logical reason not to do it but i see as the

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:25.540
big problem is the search for logic and then when people feel like they lose their logic they feel

01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:34.340
then tempted it's the pain of of directionlessness and like uh just that emptiness where where you're

01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:40.020
like well i it hurts and i think that's a really interesting thing about humans is that our neutral

01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:48.500
gill gear gill holy shit let's work we're almost done folks i that our neutral gear is painful to us

01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:53.780
if we're not engaged we're actually feeling wrong we're feeling eaten alive by like these weird

01:52:54.820 --> 01:53:00.980
cyber christ nano insects from lawnmower man and like um like just just watch it in mosquito

01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:08.100
coast that's your uh oprah oprah list the so so i just like i i definitely lost the power to

01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:13.140
articulate what i'm saying but like i it is interesting to be like hey man don't kill yourself

01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:19.940
because you never know it's also like it's more important like to me to be like yeah you never

01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:25.300
know so don't kill yourself but i know that sounds like the same thing but like i i just like it's a

01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:30.660
feeling it's a it's always a feeling that's the weird thing about humanity is there is no logical

01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:39.860
reason to stay alive there is only just just hanging out and it it it's that it's that belief that if

01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:46.100
something doesn't make sense it shouldn't exist that can be fatal for kids who who don't have an

01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:53.780
experience yet with like oh shit sometimes shit just is super dark and confusing and then all of

01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:59.380
a sudden it's not and they don't know that when they're 16 and then they do the they do things that

01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:04.500
any human can do they have the power to do things that you'd never do when you were 40 just because

01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:11.220
you've experienced more 16s by then you've been like well yeah this too shall pass and and i and

01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:15.220
so there is this wisdom even though it sounds kind of provincial it sounds like your your old

01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:22.660
daughtery guidance counselor but it's it's just like just don't act on anything that you're only

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:28.260
feeling it doesn't duck and feelings aren't valid is is that a common thing that you think about or

01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:34.180
is that something that just comes up once in a while the idea of like like offing yourself like

01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:39.220
oh i i i used to get depressed i haven't gotten depressed in quite some time thank god but i used

01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:43.780
to get like severely depressed and part of that is like intrusive suicidal thoughts but he'll be

01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:54.820
thinking about it next wednesday night in a cage with uh elan musk for real like our our friends

01:54:54.820 --> 01:55:00.980
keep killing themselves like our funny friends keep dying i'm not gonna kill myself don't please

01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:05.460
and no i'm not i'm this is what you think but that's actually a thought that you that like

01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:11.700
runs through your brain oh god i would i love i really love being alive and i wouldn't like i i

01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:16.100
used to have depression i don't now but i and i and it recurred through my i've thought about it too

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:20.660
i think it's important for people to go like it's a thought how did you go from being uh thoughts of

01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:26.260
depression and to not being depressed like what was the transition for you jesus it was a long

01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:32.900
fucking fiber journey it was my fiber journey you should read my book it's on amazon i've read

01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:38.500
your fiber blog fiber cured my depression fiber enemas spencer you got thoughts it was quinoa it

01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:45.620
was quinoa yeah it's a combo of quinoa and fiber and just like a basic like i i i rub fiber into

01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:52.100
my prolapse in the morning and it just like makes me no no i i that was not that just so you know

01:55:52.100 --> 01:55:56.340
and thank you for asking that now is that not a cry for help it was and there's not a secret

01:55:56.340 --> 01:56:02.180
thing underneath it or like i i really like to be alive i i don't have any desire at all to no

01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:06.180
longer exist i have this beautiful son and a wonderful wife i love to exist i i like it so

01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:13.540
much but i do think that depressed people uh they even that's this what is a psychologically

01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:17.940
documented thing which is intrusive suicidal thoughts become shameful you know you're like oh

01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:23.140
my god my brain spit out this horrific way of doing things and then you feel embarrassed about it

01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:27.540
because you're like you don't want to talk about it and also you don't want to talk about it and then

01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:31.860
you kill yourself but then you're like are my but you're thinking like shit man i must be so crazy

01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:38.500
that i'd want to do that when and i really do mean this is not that i'm saying the instinct to kill

01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:44.180
yourself is actually more of an instinct to move beyond who you think you are you're just desperately

01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:50.180
trying to solve the problem of this micro is hardcore compression into your identity and so

01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:56.020
uh this which is why i one of the things i've heard is before you reject yourself you need to

01:56:56.020 --> 01:57:01.380
know yourself how can you reject yourself if you don't know who you are and so the idea is to first

01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:07.780
prior to any kind of horrific solution like that see if you can figure out what you actually are

01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:12.580
and in that exploration it's really cool because like literally everything in the material universe

01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:19.140
if you zoom in on it far enough it disappears similarly the identity itself if you spend any

01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:25.620
time analyzing it and deeply looking into it you will begin to notice the most beautiful terrifying

01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:32.260
and ultimately liberating thing happens which is you as you thought you were ceased to exist

01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:36.980
and you didn't have to jump out of a building for that to happen and somewhere in there i think is

01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:44.420
something quite beautiful and uh a far less destructive solution for your community and

01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:49.220
and i think there's some compassion there too there's something really sweet about being in all

01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:53.300
that fucking pain that you get into when you're depressed beyond pain you wish you were in pain

01:57:53.300 --> 01:58:02.020
you wish you were sad anything to not just feel that numb dead entropic miasmic paralysis you

01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:07.220
would give anything just to feel a moment of sadness and somewhere in that there is something so

01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:12.340
sweet and beautiful about still finding the strength to stay alive because you know the

01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:18.180
people around you would be so devastated to me that is a really beautiful thing and that is a

01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:22.900
reason to stay alive and a logical reason to stay alive aside from the fact that when you kill

01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:28.740
yourself a hundred percent of the time you wake up and you're having a deja vu as a metro city bus

01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:39.220
