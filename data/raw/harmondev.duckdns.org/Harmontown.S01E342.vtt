{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:27.680\nHere we are, welcome everybody from the fantabulous confines of the dynasty typewriter here in\n\n00:27.680 --> 00:31.280\nMacArthur Park with a sweeping icing that's flowing down.\n\n00:31.280 --> 00:33.280\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:33.280 --> 00:37.280\nAll right.\n\n00:37.280 --> 00:44.880\nSpencer Crittenden.\n\n00:44.880 --> 00:56.960\nAnd just for good measure, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:56.960 --> 01:12.640\nHere we are, welcome everybody from the fantabulous confines of the dynasty typewriter here in\n\n01:12.640 --> 01:35.840\nMacArthur Park with a sweeping icing that's flowing down.\n\n01:35.840 --> 01:43.200\nThe mayor of Tijuana would be like, you have a point about our bathrooms.\n\n01:43.200 --> 01:47.520\nThey are not a place for surgery to take place.\n\n01:47.520 --> 01:54.320\nI think if you wash your hands during Comic-Con, they get dirtier than if you just don't wash\n\n01:54.320 --> 01:55.320\nthem.\n\n01:55.320 --> 01:59.040\nAnyways, thank you for that.\n\n01:59.040 --> 02:00.040\nI like that beat.\n\n02:00.040 --> 02:03.680\nThat was like a very old Western, it felt like I was on a prairie.\n\n02:03.680 --> 02:11.200\nLet's give it up for Zac McKeever up on the beat booth.\n\n02:11.200 --> 02:18.520\nBut don't let my forced anxiety driven rhymes cast a pallor on what was really probably\n\n02:18.520 --> 02:21.800\none of the most delightful Comic-Cons ever, which is saying a lot because I always have\n\n02:21.800 --> 02:22.800\na good time there.\n\n02:22.800 --> 02:24.800\nDid you have a good time at Comic-Con?\n\n02:24.800 --> 02:25.800\nOh boy.\n\n02:25.800 --> 02:31.120\nYou love crowds and adulation and it was packed this year.\n\n02:31.120 --> 02:35.800\nI felt like on Thursday it was as packed as Friday, and on Friday I thought it was as\n\n02:35.800 --> 02:38.720\npacked as it was on Saturday of the prior year.\n\n02:38.720 --> 02:41.280\nI didn't go on Saturday because I was terrified.\n\n02:41.280 --> 02:51.360\nIt's kind of interesting this year, I'm in some kind of limbo where I'm constantly aware\n\n02:51.360 --> 02:58.080\nof like, okay Harmon, this is a thing to not be taken for granted getting on a golf cart\n\n02:58.080 --> 03:02.600\nand doing this thing, it's a thing that you keep doing.\n\n03:02.600 --> 03:07.480\nYou never say no to it, you go there, you definitely like it, it's a religious experience\n\n03:07.480 --> 03:08.480\nfor you.\n\n03:08.480 --> 03:13.120\nYou go there and it's like Mecca for all these people and you're a part of that, you're a\n\n03:13.120 --> 03:20.320\nlittle baby priest or cardinal, dare I say, within this Vatican of, these are probably\n\n03:20.320 --> 03:24.440\nbad metaphors to draw upon in our turbulent times.\n\n03:24.440 --> 03:29.560\nWhat metaphor, what analogy can you use anymore?\n\n03:29.560 --> 03:37.920\nBut anyways, this year I was kind of like, I was so afraid to either take it for granted\n\n03:37.920 --> 03:42.760\nor overindulge in it, like I'm sick of my own face and voice, so I'm like, I don't want\n\n03:42.760 --> 03:48.120\nto be a rock star, nor do I want to pretend like I don't love this experience, that I\n\n03:48.120 --> 03:54.280\nended up in this totally zen, I was like, this is what it is, this is what you do, can\n\n03:54.280 --> 04:00.520\nyou get to the lobby by 11am, 6am, can you be here and talk to this person, is that,\n\n04:00.520 --> 04:05.600\nand then you, and then what I didn't do is go to the entertainment weekly party.\n\n04:05.600 --> 04:12.280\nI didn't do these things that aren't in the moment, because trying to get into the entertainment\n\n04:12.280 --> 04:20.320\nweekly party is like the last, they do that, the entertainment weekly party is a pagan\n\n04:20.320 --> 04:26.400\nritual at Comic-Con that is specifically designed to remind everyone that they are technically\n\n04:26.400 --> 04:33.640\nnerds and that that still means being unempowered and gross.\n\n04:33.640 --> 04:39.920\nYou could show up for the entertainment weekly party at 7pm with 40 tickets and 20 wrist\n\n04:39.920 --> 04:47.120\nbands and a signed affidavit from Steven Spielberg saying, I approve of these invitations that\n\n04:47.120 --> 04:53.880\nyou sent to this person, you could represent 50% of the guest list and they would still\n\n04:53.880 --> 04:57.920\nbe like, well, I don't know, it's kind of a hot scene, can you wait over there for a\n\n04:57.920 --> 05:01.920\nsecond and you're just like, come on, let me talk to Adam Savage and get out of here,\n\n05:01.920 --> 05:07.320\nI'm tired, anyways, but I didn't go, I didn't go, and I didn't really see any of our famous\n\n05:07.320 --> 05:09.360\nfriends, I didn't even see you.\n\n05:09.360 --> 05:11.360\nYeah, one of your most famous friends.\n\n05:11.360 --> 05:16.720\nI would see you, I would just see you over in the corner of something.\n\n05:16.720 --> 05:20.080\nIn the boat, that was basically one of the only places we saw each other, I think, on\n\n05:20.080 --> 05:21.080\nthat boat.\n\n05:21.080 --> 05:26.920\nAnd I might look back at this as the year when it was the peak of maybe because given\n\n05:26.920 --> 05:34.320\nmy age range, my trajectory, I wouldn't be surprised to find out this was the year when,\n\n05:34.320 --> 05:39.480\nif you could measure it, like the most of my personal friends and acquaintances and things\n\n05:39.480 --> 05:42.760\nthat I care about were there.\n\n05:42.760 --> 05:47.920\nYeah, I didn't really, I just kind of floated around like a, like a do the same boat that\n\n05:47.920 --> 05:52.400\nwe, I was on like that kind of weird, like old, old school yachts, even better, Jeff.\n\n05:52.400 --> 05:53.400\nEven better.\n\n05:53.400 --> 05:54.400\nOh yeah.\n\n05:54.400 --> 05:55.960\nThis one had water jet pack people.\n\n05:55.960 --> 05:56.960\nI saw that.\n\n05:56.960 --> 05:59.440\nThere was a dude at night with like light up.\n\n05:59.440 --> 06:03.840\nLet's talk about the water jet pack people and Justin found out that you can't do fireworks,\n\n06:03.840 --> 06:06.720\nthe city or Harbor master or whatever I'm saying.\n\n06:06.720 --> 06:07.720\nThey hate that.\n\n06:07.720 --> 06:08.720\nYou can't do fireworks.\n\n06:08.720 --> 06:15.320\nI said, Justin, because what could be more flammable than the ocean?\n\n06:15.320 --> 06:18.120\nJustin Roiland co-creator Rick and Morty.\n\n06:18.120 --> 06:22.200\nHe gets a yacht with his buddies every, every year it's become a tradition and he wanted\n\n06:22.200 --> 06:25.040\nto do fireworks on it.\n\n06:25.040 --> 06:26.440\nAnd they said, no, you can't do that.\n\n06:26.440 --> 06:30.920\nBut what you can do, I don't know if they provide this, this, this alternative.\n\n06:30.920 --> 06:31.920\nYeah.\n\n06:31.920 --> 06:33.320\nYou could call this number.\n\n06:33.320 --> 06:41.040\nThere's these two guys that adorn themselves in Christmas lights and hover over the ocean\n\n06:41.040 --> 06:44.280\non fire hose jet packs.\n\n06:44.280 --> 06:49.680\nAnd I spent most of the night talking to the Star of Farscape about whether or not those\n\n06:49.680 --> 06:51.240\nguys had other jobs.\n\n06:51.240 --> 06:53.720\nAnd that was the most fun.\n\n06:53.720 --> 06:56.520\nI was just saying, I took an extra 10 milligrams of Adderall.\n\n06:56.520 --> 06:57.960\nI was shit-faced.\n\n06:57.960 --> 07:00.080\nI feel bad for the Star of Farscape.\n\n07:00.080 --> 07:02.640\nI never met him.\n\n07:02.640 --> 07:06.800\nI really, him and the Onion Knight, I just, I'll never see them again.\n\n07:06.800 --> 07:10.720\nThe, the man, I fucking let Liam Cunningham have it.\n\n07:10.720 --> 07:14.280\nDon't be the last Game of Thrones guy at the Justin Roiland yacht party with Dan Harmon\n\n07:14.280 --> 07:15.280\non it.\n\n07:15.280 --> 07:17.360\nYou're going to get all of that.\n\n07:17.360 --> 07:22.480\nI don't, I was, I was, I was, I was scattered the last time I was like, oh, I can do shots\n\n07:22.480 --> 07:23.480\nwith Ramsay Bolton.\n\n07:23.480 --> 07:25.080\nI was just, just the Onion Knight.\n\n07:25.080 --> 07:31.840\nI was just like, gear mirror like my, your character's like me.\n\n07:31.840 --> 07:33.440\nI got no fingers.\n\n07:33.440 --> 07:37.200\nI lost my fingers.\n\n07:37.200 --> 07:39.240\nYeah.\n\n07:39.240 --> 07:43.000\nThat last, last time I was there, there was that boat and then I turned the corner and\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:47.480\nthere was Sam, the, the, the, the chubby, oh yeah, reading guy.\n\n07:47.480 --> 07:49.480\nHe talks to my ex.\n\n07:49.480 --> 07:50.480\nWait.\n\n07:50.480 --> 07:51.480\nOkay.\n\n07:51.480 --> 07:58.280\nLet's, let's, let's take, let's take a little bit more about that.\n\n07:58.280 --> 08:07.520\nOh, the, Jesus, God, anyway, I got to get out of here, no, no, on that boat party.\n\n08:07.520 --> 08:13.960\nHe was talking to my then girlfriend and we broke up at a point, but then like his birthday\n\n08:13.960 --> 08:17.200\nrolled around it like she commissioned a picture for him for his birthday.\n\n08:17.200 --> 08:19.000\nI'm like, oh, I guess they still talk.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nThat's cool.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:24.240\nHe, you know, he won the game of thrones, he kind of did.\n\n08:24.240 --> 08:25.240\nHe kind of did.\n\n08:25.240 --> 08:26.240\nYeah.\n\n08:26.240 --> 08:30.760\nAnd did you put the timeline together ever and go, wait a minute, is he the causal thing\n\n08:30.760 --> 08:31.760\nabout all this?\n\n08:31.760 --> 08:32.920\nIt's like, I hope so.\n\n08:32.920 --> 08:34.480\nThat would be awesome.\n\n08:34.480 --> 08:37.280\nShe met him on a boat, then we broke up.\n\n08:37.280 --> 08:41.520\nThen she drew a painting of him and then, yeah, that's, that is, yep.\n\n08:41.520 --> 08:42.520\nThat would fit.\n\n08:42.520 --> 08:43.520\nThe timeline works.\n\n08:43.520 --> 08:47.960\nThose three things did happen in that order because we were dating.\n\n08:47.960 --> 08:50.360\nThat's kind of the role that he had in the show.\n\n08:50.360 --> 08:55.240\nHe was like, oh, I'm no, I'm no brand, the broken, but I really am the metaphor for the\n\n08:55.240 --> 08:59.120\nauthor and the puppet master of everything and nothing battle ever happened to me and\n\n08:59.120 --> 09:07.440\nI'll just, I just, I'm going to get all the, the West Westeros Puss and she was pregnant\n\n09:07.440 --> 09:08.440\ntoo.\n\n09:08.440 --> 09:09.440\nWhat?\n\n09:09.440 --> 09:10.440\nNo, no.\n\n09:10.440 --> 09:11.440\nOh, because Gilly was pregnant.\n\n09:11.440 --> 09:12.440\nOkay.\n\n09:12.440 --> 09:20.160\nUh, were there, were there more G.O.G. folks on the boat, no, no, no were there far scape\n\n09:20.160 --> 09:25.840\nfolks, Lin-Manuel Miranda was there, my good friend.\n\n09:25.840 --> 09:27.040\nDid you guys squash your beef?\n\n09:27.040 --> 09:31.440\nNo, we were back to back for an uncomfortable amount of time.\n\n09:31.440 --> 09:36.640\nI should, every time, I don't know, I, I, when I left that party, I identified several\n\n09:36.640 --> 09:38.960\nerrors that I made and that was one of them.\n\n09:38.960 --> 09:44.640\nOh boy, there was about six or seven crucial errors that I made and Lord knows what the\n\n09:44.640 --> 09:47.440\nparty would have been a mile like if I did not make those errors.\n\n09:47.440 --> 09:49.920\nI probably wouldn't be here tonight.\n\n09:49.920 --> 09:53.600\nLin and I collectively, although I want to say I had no fucking part of this.\n\n09:53.600 --> 10:02.800\nI don't know if he, how much he did, but like somehow we, after the boat closed, um, we accidentally\n\n10:02.800 --> 10:10.960\nspread the idea that there was a party happening at the Hilton and when the reality was the\n\n10:10.960 --> 10:16.880\nonly thing happening at the Hilton was us going to bed and we, we, we, we horribly\n\n10:16.880 --> 10:21.200\npiped like a bunch of people that probably lived the opposite direction.\n\n10:21.200 --> 10:25.520\nAnd the boat was so far away from the Hilton.\n\n10:25.520 --> 10:26.520\nYeah.\n\n10:26.520 --> 10:30.640\nAnd so are all the other hotels, like if you're at the Marriott and you walk from the boat\n\n10:30.640 --> 10:33.680\nto the Hilton, you're going to be mad walking back.\n\n10:33.680 --> 10:35.680\nYou'll be mad walking to the Hilton.\n\n10:35.680 --> 10:36.680\nYeah.\n\n10:36.680 --> 10:39.520\nNo, they were, they were mad.\n\n10:39.520 --> 10:43.960\nNick Rutherford, a new Rick and Morty writer, he, at one point he got on one of those scooters\n\n10:43.960 --> 10:49.960\nand, uh, and that was, he kind of, he, he tried to make things better by, he was doing,\n\n10:49.960 --> 10:54.840\nhe was buzzing us as a, with millennial, uh, quotes, like he was just, it was, he kept\n\n10:54.840 --> 11:00.480\nzipping by us and then saying, well, he was like saying, it was like lateral stuff.\n\n11:00.480 --> 11:01.960\nHe was like, I'm a team player.\n\n11:01.960 --> 11:06.200\nIt was like, it was, it was, it was, it was good.\n\n11:06.200 --> 11:07.200\nIt was good.\n\n11:07.200 --> 11:10.400\nHe had a good gig because he could like whiz bias, come up with one and then think about\n\n11:10.400 --> 11:12.280\nit and do it, come back.\n\n11:12.280 --> 11:13.280\nAnd it was perfect.\n\n11:13.280 --> 11:14.280\nIt was like a great bit.\n\n11:14.280 --> 11:16.280\nI, I was really excited.\n\n11:16.280 --> 11:17.280\nUh, yeah.\n\n11:17.280 --> 11:22.840\nAnd I, I, I, I made some new friends and I talked to a lot of, uh, fans and I, I was\n\n11:22.840 --> 11:28.720\nlike, I was really, I felt, I felt more like mirroring, more in the moment.\n\n11:28.720 --> 11:33.400\nIf you encountered me in San Diego, I don't know if you had more of a powerful thing\n\n11:33.400 --> 11:38.480\nthan in a day when I was less in the moment and worried that you were going to, uh, hurt\n\n11:38.480 --> 11:39.480\nme or something.\n\n11:39.480 --> 11:45.040\nAnd I, I felt like I had more intimate conversations with, uh, with the people I talked to.\n\n11:45.040 --> 11:48.880\nAnd there were a lot of people, for instance, say, you know, like, not a lot of people,\n\n11:48.880 --> 11:53.600\nbut the proper like fraction of people going, like mentioning my workout on the Instagram\n\n11:53.600 --> 11:58.560\nand how they've been watching it and, and, and, and rooting for it or whatever the, whatever\n\n11:58.560 --> 12:00.120\nyou want to say about that.\n\n12:00.120 --> 12:02.240\nPeople saying like, Hey, are you going to do another Whiting Wong?\n\n12:02.240 --> 12:03.240\nI'm like, I don't know.\n\n12:03.240 --> 12:04.240\nShould I?\n\n12:04.240 --> 12:05.240\nI don't know.\n\n12:05.240 --> 12:06.240\nFour more people asked them.\n\n12:06.240 --> 12:07.240\nI'll do it.\n\n12:07.240 --> 12:08.240\nAnd then a fourth person asked, but it was Jessica Gao.\n\n12:08.240 --> 12:13.680\nI ran, I ran into her and I was like, um, uh, yeah, I was like, maybe we should, she, she\n\n12:13.680 --> 12:16.760\nsuggested, well, why don't we, instead of thinking about whether you do another season\n\n12:16.760 --> 12:20.640\nof Whiting Wongs, why don't you do like, why don't we just do one-offs, like, like, what's,\n\n12:20.640 --> 12:24.840\nwhat's the harm of just getting together and doing like an episode, haven't you whited\n\n12:24.840 --> 12:25.840\nall the Wongs?\n\n12:25.840 --> 12:29.000\nWell, that's the thing is that's why I wanted, I was like, well, we're talking in circles\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.160\nand I, I, there's a point where it's actually distracting, right?\n\n12:32.160 --> 12:33.160\nYeah.\n\n12:33.160 --> 12:37.480\nBut, but I think, I think, I think enough Wongs have, I think there's, I think there's\n\n12:37.480 --> 12:38.880\nsome, yeah, racial equality has been restored.\n\n12:38.880 --> 12:40.280\nYeah, it's exactly.\n\n12:40.280 --> 12:41.280\nYeah.\n\n12:41.280 --> 12:42.280\nYeah.\n\n12:42.280 --> 12:43.280\nYeah.\n\n12:43.280 --> 12:47.560\nWhere are, all right, well, that's I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n\n12:47.560 --> 12:48.800\nyeah,

music sounded like your job was now to throw a knife at a woman and\n\n15:15.900 --> 15:16.900\nmiss.\n\n15:16.900 --> 15:35.700\nYou sounded very like, please welcome the enigmatic professor blade, but it's magic.\n\n15:35.700 --> 15:36.900\nIt's magic.\n\n15:36.900 --> 15:40.100\nI follow you into the light and kill you again.\n\n15:40.100 --> 15:45.100\nI don't think there's a more unimpressive way to describe that trick than missing someone\n\n15:45.100 --> 15:46.100\nwith a knife.\n\n15:46.100 --> 15:47.100\nIt's so negative.\n\n15:47.100 --> 15:48.100\nI mean, I love it.\n\n15:48.100 --> 15:49.100\nIt's amazing.\n\n15:49.100 --> 15:58.100\nIt's like William Teller, just like some asshole, oh, he missed his kid.\n\n15:58.100 --> 16:01.500\nI guess that's when they brought the balloons in there, like, can I, can we put this in\n\n16:01.500 --> 16:04.020\na positive way in the press release?\n\n16:04.020 --> 16:11.220\nHe hit a balloon, yeah, asterisk that was really close to a lady, right?\n\n16:11.220 --> 16:15.100\nSo did he miss the lady because I'm not coming to see the show if he didn't miss the lady.\n\n16:15.100 --> 16:16.100\nYes, sir.\n\n16:16.100 --> 16:20.980\nHe missed the lady, but we want you to know that he's a proactive knife thrower.\n\n16:20.980 --> 16:22.460\nHe doesn't just miss things.\n\n16:22.460 --> 16:25.740\nOkay, because I was going to say I could miss a lady with a knife.\n\n16:25.740 --> 16:27.500\nI've been doing it for 30 years.\n\n16:27.500 --> 16:33.500\nThat's called marriage.\n\n16:33.500 --> 16:38.340\nSir that

they're like, should he have a kid?\n\n17:20.820 --> 17:22.980\nOh, is that what that was?\n\n17:22.980 --> 17:27.100\nYeah, well, they're like, I think he maybe should, but should he I don't know.\n\n17:27.100 --> 17:33.540\nIt's different from like, I mean, Bill Cosby, well, yeah, he had a kid is America's dad.\n\n17:33.540 --> 17:34.540\nLook how that turned out.\n\n17:34.540 --> 17:35.540\nJesus Christ.\n\n17:35.540 --> 17:36.540\nI'm not.\n\n17:36.540 --> 17:37.540\nWell, I can't.\n\n17:37.540 --> 17:39.420\nFirst of all, I'm getting so insecure up here.\n\n17:39.420 -->

earshot.\n\n18:32.340 --> 18:36.220\nI would get a plunger and try and just stuff it back in.\n\n18:36.220 --> 18:42.500\nA blender, a plunger, a blender, now a blender now that could be something

people\n\n19:46.580 --> 19:51.100\nthink that the pediatricians are making money off the vaccines but it's not the case.\n\n19:51.100 --> 19:56.500\nIt's the pediatricians are usually connected to proctologists if you do they're getting\n\n19:56.500 --> 20:01.300\nkickbacks from the kickbacks from the proctologists yeah so blast them with a vaccine within a\n\n20:01.300 --> 20:07.020\nmonth their asshole falls out you know the whole story classic yeah that's that's part\n\n20:07.020 --> 20:13.020\nof your recent Washington Post piece about prolapse assholes and yeah pediatricians

something other than him being a real schnook oh so you're gonna call me\n\n20:33.060 --> 20:38.220\na schnook because my asshole fell out I'm just saying like a stigma against people who\n\n20:38.220 --> 20:43.940\nhave that you're you're very life partner brought up the question like if it happened\n\n20:43.940 --> 20:48.780\nto you in your own bathroom would you even call my name or would you be so embarrassed\n\n20:48.780 --> 20:53.780\nthat this fate befell you that you would simply try to stuff it back up there like a Kleenex\n\n20:53.780 --> 21:01.460\nwith a plunger I mean so shit so

21:14.500\nit's you don't even mean to do it but there's a lot of stigma attached to prolapse does your\n\n21:14.500 --> 21:20.100\npartner often give you weird hypothetical situations like that or is that the first one\n\n21:20.100 --> 21:27.300\nor like oh no she gets she's she'll like the other day she texted me because like I had\n\n21:27.300 --> 21:31.900\nit like I've been very busy lately so I had like a day off she's like just relax just relax\n\n21:31.900 --> 21:36.420\nand like see if you know you could just chill out today and like within two seconds the next\n\n21:36.420 --> 21:42.340\ntext was if we get a home invader you know we have to fight for our love yeah no matter\n\n21:42.340 --> 21:51.660\nwhat because they'll just kill us anyway what it was is she just hanging her weird anxieties\n\n21:51.660 --> 21:57.100\non you like just like let them like hang them out to dry because you're done well no I think\n\n21:57.100 --> 22:01.540\nshe's gotten sucked into one of these mommy groups and it's like because after you have\n\n22:01.540 --> 22:06.420\na baby there's all these mommy groups is what they're called so it's like mom's like sort\n\n22:06.420 --> 22:12.420\nof like support groups for having children people who just had a baby which is like incredibly\n\n22:12.420 --> 22:17.620\npainful for the man for the woman it's not so bad they fake it's a different study but\n\n22:17.620 --> 22:23.620\nthey have to they have to meet in mommy group they have like online mommy groups and I think\n\n22:23.620 --> 22:27.420\nsomewhere in there some probably they were talking about that your asshole can prolapse\n\n22:27.420 --> 22:33.500\nwhen you have a baby it probably triggers I mean probably every instinct possible regarding\n\n22:33.500 --> 22:37.580\nanything dangerous that can ever happen I think that's safe enough to say that we see\n\n22:37.580 --> 22:45.140\nthat in bearers of our nation's children like they through the eyes of those of us that\n\n22:45.140 --> 22:51.060\nare childless like it's pretty easy to recognize that having a child changes you and not in\n\n22:51.060 --> 22:56.220\nways that are fun for the childless because everything is becomes about like that's a\n\n22:56.220 --> 23:03.420\npretty sharp corner of a electrical outlet like that's right like and just beyond that\n\n23:03.420 --> 23:08.660\nI mean because that's understandable definitely cover your electrical what brand of baby did\n\n23:08.660 --> 23:16.660\nyou have boy girl we had a boy a boy yeah brand we had a Costco boy yeah it's great\n\n23:16.660 --> 23:22.260\nnow it's wonderful but yeah you do go for you can't you have if you like watch an episode\n\n23:22.260 --> 23:28.460\nof preppers and you will see peak that's what authentic doomsday preppers called doomsday\n\n23:28.460 --> 23:34.140\npreppers preppers no you've seen the show preppers yeah we're on a last name basis with the act\n\n23:34.140 --> 23:39.900\nof doomsday prepping that's how prepped we are like you have to abbreviate it because\n\n23:39.900 --> 23:43.740\nyeah because this fucking doomsday is coming preppers like what else are you prepping for\n\n23:43.740 --> 23:52.260\na fucking salad no doomsday everyone's first course but it happened that's like you will\n\n23:52.260 --> 23:56.140\nyou can become a prepper if you have a baby pretty easily and you could see you could\n\n23:56.140 --> 24:02.340\nsee how it goes yeah you're just like how does your prepping like walk us through a new\n\n24:02.340 --> 24:06.740\nfather's prepping like what do you do well I can't break that or all in half and put\n\n24:06.740 --> 24:12.780\nit in my pocket anymore I have to put it back in the bottle because the baby might reach\n\n24:12.780 --> 24:17.060\nin with its little sausage fingers you can't have first of all thing is like if you in the\n\n24:17.060 --> 24:23.260\nold days I was like a walking yeah you know I like wild animals pick up seeds in the forest\n\n24:23.260 --> 24:28.860\nthat's what I was with drugs just in my pockets like you know in your hair you're like oh fuck\n\n24:28.860 --> 24:34.580\ntake a bag of ketamine holy shit so you can't you know what I mean you can't do that you\n\n24:34.580 --> 24:40.460\ncan't have you can't have any there can be no so that your doomsday prepping for your\n\n24:40.460 --> 24:46.580\nbaby is just not having loose drugs hanging about the silo Simon out of your beard in\n\n24:46.580 --> 24:51.620\ncase it wants to kiss you you can't do it anymore so that's a pragmatic approach and\n\n24:51.620 --> 24:58.260\nthen and then you know what am I what am I gonna do fucking like build a arc or something\n\n24:58.260 --> 25:03.340\nI could now I don't I don't have the discipline I'm to do that kind of thing you're gonna\n\n25:03.340 --> 25:09.940\nhave to build an arc but that's what someone told someone a long time ago and look what\n\n25:09.940 --> 25:17.500\nhappened you're not gonna have to build an arc trust me but name one other guy that had\n\n25:17.500 --> 25:21.940\nto build an arc name one other person that had to build an arc you mean besides Noah\n\n25:21.940 --> 25:29.420\nyeah name one other person well the unicorn as it turns out should have yeah damn didn't\n\n25:29.420 --> 25:34.420\nthe unicorn didn't he was wearing beautiful suits and having fun hosting shows and then\n\n25:34.420 --> 25:37.700\nlook what happened to him you know that song they didn't make you sing that song when you're\n\n25:37.700 --> 25:43.140\nin grade school yeah the rats and bats and elephants and porpoises too and everybody\n\n25:43.140 --> 25:50.060\ndidn't give a fuck about the unicorn there's a song but I'm sad fucking traumatic song\n\n25:50.060 --> 25:54.820\nfor children that they taught me in my Milwaukee public school was like I was like oh god this\n\n25:54.820 --> 26:01.620\nfucking song again like it takes you through the ballad of how the unicorn what once fucking\n\n26:01.620 --> 26:09.700\nfrolicked along with every other animal and then then this fucking biblical event happened\n\n26:09.700 --> 26:14.220\nin the I guess I don't know if the unicorn was I don't know the unicorn was out fucking\n\n26:14.220 --> 26:18.460\naround having a good old time and didn't get on the boat yeah is it was it Harry shaping\n\n26:18.460 --> 26:25.740\nI don't think any animal deserves to not be on the arc did they not care about dinosaurs\n\n26:25.740 --> 26:32.180\nwell the don I mean no the problem was at that time the dinosaurs were they were I think\n\n26:32.180 --> 26:38.300\nextinct we had our bones planted by the devil yeah the test us yeah the devil planted fucking\n\n26:38.300 --> 26:43.500\ngiant bones everywhere but the Bible talks about the Leviathan and the behemoth aren't\n\n26:43.500 --> 26:48.220\nthose like dinosaurs or so those are whales those are pouring both of them yeah well\n\n26:48.220 --> 26:52.620\nthey're extinct whale you're saying okay those are dinosaurs and they're extinct I thought\n\n26:52.620 --> 26:57.020\nthat those were the Bible talking about dinosaurs they're like check this out there's a brontosaurus\n\n26:57.020 --> 27:01.220\ncalled behemoth the Bible talks there is no brontosaurus it's a made up dinosaur I think\n\n27:01.220 --> 27:07.820\nit's real dinosaurs are made up what they're just you know it I know what oh you're gonna\n\n27:07.820 --> 27:16.220\ndo the agenda huh okay there was dinosaurs the whole planet was covered in lizards yeah\n\n27:16.220 --> 27:26.780\nyeah that makes sense that's how I'd make a planet cover it in giant lizards sure you\n\n27:26.780 --> 27:34.740\nknow because we've seen them everywhere say when you were high and an atheist did you\n\n27:34.740 --> 27:41.580\nhear the thing I heard there was a NPR thing a radio lab thing where they kind of updated\n\n27:41.580 --> 27:48.900\nthe model of what of the extinction event for dinosaurs and whereas we used to think\n\n27:48.900 --> 27:54.820\nit was like meteor hits and cloud of dust goes up blocks out the sun plants die things\n\n27:54.820 --> 27:59.100\nthat eat the plants die things that eat the things that eat plants die it no it was a\n\n27:59.100 --> 28:10.300\nfucking supersonic bullet from the great unknown that shot into the planet at somewhere around\n\n28:10.300 --> 28:19.220\nthe speed of sound or light and fucking like vaporized so much rock as it jetted into the\n\n28:19.220 --> 28:26.980\nplanet that the rock vapor filled the atmosphere immediately started cooling turned into a cloud\n\n28:26.980 --> 28:32.620\nof tiny glass beads that got so hot as they started falling back to the earth that the\n\n28:32.620 --> 28:37.900\nentire planet in the span of two hours got as hot as a pizza oven and every living thing\n\n28:37.900 --> 28:48.580\non earth died from having their blood boiling yeah and it does hold up because because it\n\n28:48.580 --> 28:55.900\nis it would otherwise be weird it was some of the best pizza we ever had but definitely\n\n28:55.900 --> 28:59.820\nyou'd be dead before your blood boiled there's no way you know your blood doesn't you're\n\n28:59.820 --> 29:05.580\nlike oh god that's jingly I think my blood's boiling but what I still don't understand\n\n29:05.580 --> 29:09.620\nthose so okay then what because what we always learned is that oh the dinosaurs all die as\n\n29:09.620 --> 29:13.740\na meteor in the sky and I think and then the little the little marmoset comes out that\n\n29:13.740 --> 29:18.300\nrepresents us you know and they show you the film at the museum and it's like that's us\n\n29:18.300 --> 29:25.700\nlike there's like a little a little thing with big eyes comes out of a log and it's like\n\n29:25.700 --> 29:30.820\nwhat that thing don't act that thing don't got no boilable blood player I think they\n\n29:30.820 --> 29:35.980\nsaid you know what they had adapted well they stayed underground underground because they\n\n29:35.980 --> 29:41.020\nwere giant lizards are gonna eat them so they learn to live like under the radar but I mean\n\n29:41.020 --> 29:44.700\nall right well I don't look I mean it's worth the give it a google this isn't the podcast\n\n29:44.700 --> 29:52.060\nto learn stuff I did think of you speaking to doomsday prepping though I think of you\n\n29:52.060 --> 29:56.620\nfor other reasons other than this but there is this there is it I don't know if you've\n\n29:56.620 --> 30:02.700\nheard of this guy and now I can't remember his goddamn name so I can't ask you if you've\n\n30:02.700 --> 30:06.820\nheard of him but I feel like maybe you'll remember his name if I describe what he was\n\n30:06.820 --> 30:13.220\na he was like a hacker guy that was like a genius and then he he got like sentenced to\n\n30:13.220 --> 30:17.060\nsome stuff for hacking early in his life but then he like they let him off because he was\n\n30:17.060 --> 30:20.620\nlike just a bright kid and they're like don't waste his life let him let him be smart with\n\n30:20.620 --> 30:25.180\ncomputers and maybe he'll now that he's learned his lesson and he like was an early bitcoin\n\n30:25.180 --> 30:30.620\nadopter and then he like invested all his bitcoin money into like the style he was just so he\n\n30:30.620 --> 30:36.060\nwas just like super rich and super autonomous and super smart and then he got really really\n\n30:36.060 --> 30:43.780\nparanoid and he uh he was he he he got a house and he dug tunnels under the house that were\n\n30:43.780 --> 30:48.940\ngoing in every direction all under the his entire neighborhood underneath all his neighbors\n\n30:48.940 --> 30:54.260\nhouses which I always I was like you could just do that fuck I want that's all I've ever\n\n30:54.260 --> 31:01.020\nwanted to do is minecraft underneath everybody and just be like like like like I mean I wouldn't\n\n31:01.020 --> 31:04.860\nlike eavesdrop on you or anything I'd just be like under your house and I'd be like happy\n\n31:04.860 --> 31:10.740\nand you'd be happy because you'd be like I love showering and I'd be like I love dirt\n\n31:10.740 --> 31:15.380\nand every once in a while I'd I'd grab the pipes like chunking the goonies and chunk\n\n31:15.380 --> 31:20.460\nyou know what's his name sloth and go like like that and then I'd hear the calamity above\n\n31:20.460 --> 31:26.700\nme that would be so fucking weird but the guy and you under someone's house like it's\n\n31:26.700 --> 31:31.740\nlike Harmony Burra down there he's got but the guy was totally prepping for doomsday\n\n31:31.740 --> 31:35.820\nthat's why I was digging these tunnels and he was so any but he had some plan that involved\n\n31:35.820 --> 31:43.740\nlike app development or something and he hired this kid to work for him and he was so dedicated\n\n31:43.740 --> 31:48.540\nto no one knowing about his tunnels because what good is a network of tunnels under your\n\n31:48.540 --> 31:52.620\nhouse if anybody knows about him except for all the people he hired to dig them and let\n\n31:52.620 --> 31:57.460\njust leave after they were like these are gonna cave in pretty soon bye and he didn't\n\n31:57.460 --> 32:04.220\ndo anything about them but he this kid that he hired to write his mysterious doomsday software\n\n32:04.220 --> 32:07.540\nhe put he did this whole thing where he picked him up from an airport he put like a crazy\n\n32:07.540 --> 32:12.300\nlike Silicon Valley version of a blindfold on him drove him around for three hours took\n\n32:12.300 --> 32:18.140\nhim to the fucking tunnels gave him a bucket an Xbox and a laptop and said you're gonna\n\n32:18.140 --> 32:23.860\nwork down here why can't he work at a hotel I don't know I guess he didn't want to literally\n\n32:23.860 --> 32:28.300\nknow what city he was in maybe I don't know but he didn't dig a hotel he can't dig a\n\n32:28.300 --> 32:34.700\nhotel I mean he tried to disastrous results because then like at some point a fire happened\n\n32:34.700 --> 32:41.020\ndown there I mean the guy had no he was a hoarder and he was you know he was very very paranoid\n\n32:41.020 --> 32:46.420\nabout the government you know knowing everything he was doing not not that paranoia doesn't\n\n32:46.420 --> 32:52.980\ntypically apply to like also this is a fire hazard and so he just had stacks of newspapers\n\n32:52.980 --> 33:01.300\nand magazines and things and and had this kid living down in his spider dungeon while\n\n33:01.300 --> 33:07.580\nhe lived upstairs and then the kid texted him like I smell smoke and it might be an electrical\n\n33:07.580 --> 33:12.420\nfire and he was like all right then I'll turn off all the lights down there and and then\n\n33:12.420 --> 33:17.380\nand then like so then that guy was down there walking through a maze of hoarded newspapers\n\n33:17.380 --> 33:23.260\nand burning walls and he probably passed out from smoke inhalation and died one of the\n\n33:23.260 --> 33:28.020\nmost horrible deaths you can do and the the the guy made it out into the lawn and was\n\n33:28.020 --> 33:32.580\nlike I think someone's in there in the fire department was like holy shit there's a fucking\n\n33:32.580 --> 33:37.820\nprairie dog city under your house fuck anyways do you remember do you know that guy's name\n\n33:37.820 --> 33:48.220\nMichael Stipe Daryl Clunt I was close no it's it's it's like Eric DeWitt or something\n\n33:48.220 --> 33:52.740\nno man I don't know that guy's name it just seemed like the kind of guy like like that\n\n33:52.740 --> 33:57.340\nmaybe you're you know you're you're you're you're your congregation and my congregation\n\n33:57.340 --> 34:02.900\nthey they have a joyful overlap I like to think and then like I but then there's like there's\n\n34:02.900 --> 34:08.500\nstuff that your congregation probably thinks about more than than my perception of mine\n\n34:08.500 --> 34:12.220\nand I thought that might be one of them that that if a guy was like who was convinced that\n\n34:12.220 --> 34:14.980\nthe world was ending so much that he dug all these tunnels and then accidentally killed\n\n34:14.980 --> 34:19.980\na dude I thought maybe that was well you know man to what I think when I see these fucking\n\n34:19.980 --> 34:28.020\npreppers is why do you want like they want to stay alive after everything ends yeah like\n\n34:28.020 --> 34:32.180\nwhile things are happening they're not that into it they want right you know what I'm\n\n34:32.180 --> 34:37.620\nsaying so it's like that you look at the life of this subterranean I know I know I know\n\n34:37.620 --> 34:44.860\nwhy why because I'm from Wisconsin that's not why I that's why I know why yeah because\n\n34:44.860 --> 34:51.580\nI that's something that I'm coping with in therapy is this insidious compulsive fear\n\n34:51.580 --> 35:01.660\nof being a schmuck of being the the the the the mark the rub okay there's so much emphasis\n\n35:01.660 --> 35:09.700\nin the Midwest on how you those people in California New York they're crazy they're pretentious\n\n35:09.700 --> 35:15.300\nthey're delusional they don't understand that you're supposed to have winter for 10 months\n\n35:15.300 --> 35:23.300\nand that your car doors was to freeze broken they're not practical people we're practical\n\n35:23.300 --> 35:30.380\npeople and if you're ever should you ever be caught off guard by your taxes or your medical\n\n35:30.380 --> 35:36.540\npayments or anything like that it's like there's a bigger fear of that and I'm only using my\n\n35:36.540 --> 35:47.380\neye statements I'm not if you're from Milwaukee and you're like fuck you I'm fucking cool\n\n35:47.380 --> 35:52.020\nbut I do think it's like a cultural thing like in the more in the less coastal thing\n\n35:52.020 --> 36:02.620\nwhere you're like I I I I I I'm more afraid of being anyone's sucker than I am afraid\n\n36:02.620 --> 36:10.940\nof not living a fun life okay so so like that it's like you that you you can live to 75\n\n36:10.940 --> 36:17.740\nin a freezing tundra thumbing your chin that's a Midwestern thing if you do it with your\n\n36:17.740 --> 36:23.540\nnose it might break off the the you you can you can die happy going like these yeah but\n\n36:23.540 --> 36:28.220\nat least I didn't go to California where those people are crazy they talk to their own hair\n\n36:28.220 --> 36:33.980\nthey're crazy like like and and so I that's that's I'm not saying this guy's from the\n\n36:33.980 --> 36:40.100\nMidwest I'm saying doomsday prepping I totally get it because I when I think about it I get\n\n36:40.100 --> 36:44.420\nI'm like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because my biggest nightmare about about turning on\n\n36:44.420 --> 36:49.820\nthe TV and and and have it have it's gonna well it happened the thing that you've been\n\n36:49.820 --> 36:54.300\nthinking might have happened for 40 years because it's like one of many things that might happen\n\n36:54.300 --> 37:00.780\nwould happen and I don't have the fucking bag of shit I could have bought yeah for 40 years\n\n37:00.780 --> 37:07.100\nI'm just gonna be like oh I lost at life yeah when really that's not how you lose it life\n\n37:07.100 --> 37:13.060\nyou lose it life by living after the apocalypse yeah by living in a shit tunnel with a bunch\n\n37:13.060 --> 37:23.220\nof newspapers and smoke and you'd climb out and why it's a it seems like the entire phenomena\n\n37:23.220 --> 37:32.100\nis really really tragic not just because the preppers kids like God may you never be born\n\n37:32.100 --> 37:37.820\nto a family of preppers it's the fact that those people should what they say is gonna\n\n37:37.820 --> 37:43.780\nhappen happens that's the those are the going to be the people who create the next human\n\n37:43.780 --> 37:50.180\nrace well I mean that and that resonates with like our our model of like Australia and America\n\n37:50.180 --> 37:55.780\nlike we we often refer to that as if there's like maybe a oh you know you know why Americans\n\n37:55.780 --> 38:02.860\nare obsessed with tits and guns is because it's part of our like genetic socio psychological\n\n38:02.860 --> 38:07.660\nlike thing that we were like where we run from things and panic more easily because back\n\n38:07.660 --> 38:14.300\nin the day when traveling the Atlantic was 70% lethal yeah like it actually created a\n\n38:14.300 --> 38:18.460\nfilter of the kind of people that had children from which people are descended and actually\n\n38:18.460 --> 38:22.980\nit's the some people will make the argument that like Australians and Americans are like\n\n38:22.980 --> 38:28.140\nwe're different like in our psychology in our culture because it's like we're descended\n\n38:28.140 --> 38:38.860\nfrom from crazy people oh you mean like yeah like we have some kind of like genetic survival\n\n38:38.860 --> 38:43.420\nweirdness or paranoia I think paranoia is like probably the better way to talk about\n\n38:43.420 --> 38:48.780\nit yeah well for sure I mean definitely paranoia I mean in anger a lot of it a lot of anger\n\n38:48.780 --> 38:54.660\nI mean the country's been at war for what is it 93% of its history now 94% of its history\n\n38:54.660 --> 39:00.540\nhours yeah I think it's 93% someone out there probably knows 93% 94% of our history been\n\n39:00.540 --> 39:05.740\nat war now they're finding out trauma gets encoded in your DNA there's epigenetic trauma\n\n39:05.740 --> 39:11.060\nso even if you didn't go to war if like your grandfather went to war and he did hello there\n\n39:11.060 --> 39:18.060\nyou go hey yeah great so it gets stuck in you yeah good job well that's cool because\n\n39:18.060 --> 39:22.500\nI didn't really talk to my grandpa's as much as I should have given that they fought Nazis\n\n39:22.500 --> 39:26.700\nwell you basically did with your genes yeah now I can be like you know it's a hard it's\n\n39:26.700 --> 39:33.300\na hard war yeah I'm gonna go out back and take a photo of me smoking a cigarette on\n\n39:33.300 --> 39:39.340\na tank yeah I always feel like the doomsday preppers are the worst off because it's not\n\n39:39.340 --> 39:42.780\nlike I guess there's some of them who do it secretly but like if anyone knows you're\n\n39:42.780 --> 39:46.980\na doomsday prepper that's the first place I'm gonna fucking go to it's like you probably\n\n39:46.980 --> 39:51.300\nwant to like if someone has like a crazy house full of water it's like I'm gonna go shoot\n\n39:51.300 --> 39:55.140\nthat place up you're not gonna do that you're not gonna shoot up a place I'm just thinking\n\n39:55.140 --> 40:00.460\nof like the masses that are that are looking for in haven't I'm gonna go straight to dance\n\n40:00.460 --> 40:05.380\nplace I might yeah me too that's my damn when it all falls to shit I'm going straight\n\n40:05.380 --> 40:08.860\nto dance place because he has a gun he doesn't know how to work he's got all the water he's\n\n40:08.860 --> 40:15.460\ngot he's got all the water he'll he'll point a gun that's not the safety on he doesn't\n\n40:15.460 --> 40:20.500\nknow how that fucking thing happens and I'll just go movie hey look I live here now and\n\n40:20.500 --> 40:25.860\nwe're gonna have and then I'm gonna take your gun I'm gonna show you how to work it oh and\n\n40:25.860 --> 40:33.740\nthen kill you that kind of shit what a roller coaster ride yeah I went into a when I when\n\n40:33.740 --> 40:37.540\nwe were shooting this show when I'm shooting the show Joe Rogan called Joe Rogan questions\n\n40:37.540 --> 40:44.660\neverything we were like it was a very funny show because he because he never questioned\n\n40:44.660 --> 40:54.980\nJoe Rogan admit it knows like we both went into the show I know I did we both went into\n\n40:54.980 --> 41:00.020\nthe show with a kind of like I really thought maybe we're gonna fucking find something I\n\n41:00.020 --> 41:03.620\nremember you telling me about this because you and I like seems like a different world\n\n41:03.620 --> 41:09.420\nbut we were briefly talking about like developing a thing yeah yeah yeah that's right like where\n\n41:09.420 --> 41:15.340\nyou go and you were like I just did that and it's like it didn't well it was it was because\n\n41:15.340 --> 41:20.300\nif you want to treat you Art Bell does it really in a perfect way or he did in a perfect\n\n41:20.300 --> 41:26.740\nway wait did he died right unfortunately Art Bell passed yeah anyway he did he like would\n\n41:26.740 --> 41:32.340\njust let people talk about the story he doesn't question it whereas like Rogan over the course\n\n41:32.340 --> 41:38.380\nof the series began to realize like oh yeah when it's not of course it's not it's not\n\n41:38.380 --> 41:42.940\nout there we're just meet we're meeting with people who are like saying they have alien\n\n41:42.940 --> 41:49.500\nseeds and planted in them and stuff and but anyway we ended up in a underground subterranean\n\n41:49.500 --> 41:57.980\nlimestone cave I ended up there metaphorically no creatively yeah that too but called reality\n\n41:57.980 --> 42:05.380\ntelling yeah but it was a kid it was like an as a limestone gave the government had used\n\n42:05.380 --> 42:10.220\na store shit and then this guy bought it and he was renting out space where you could park\n\n42:10.220 --> 42:17.100\nyour RV down there and you realize like once the doors shut right the blast doors shut\n\n42:17.100 --> 42:25.260\nand it locks that guy becomes yeah king I saw a thing you remember you telling me about\n\n42:25.260 --> 42:29.180\nthat is like let's try they put a tricycle out there because they like worries of it\n\n42:29.180 --> 42:34.460\nit's like oh the future of tomorrow thing and it's like oh god no like Lord the playground\n\n42:34.460 --> 42:38.500\nthat underground yeah like remind me that I'll be coming in with a child when there's\n\n42:38.500 --> 42:44.580\nno law and I'm still who I am that's right and can't do a sit-up much less stand up\n\n42:44.580 --> 42:49.980\nto the guy who had the foresight and biceps to dig a hole I'm living in now that's right\n\n42:49.980 --> 42:56.940\nhere's my toddler take care of her I'm gonna go hunt for frozen pizza yeah I hope nothing\n\n42:56.940 --> 43:04.580\nuntoward happens as you create a new society with my mosquito coast the anyways the mosquito\n\n43:04.580 --> 43:08.420\ncoast you gotta watch that movie it's amazing I think it's actually really relevant now\n\n43:08.420 --> 43:14.540\nand it's Harrison Ford so you can be into it that's before he was so sleepy like he\n\n43:14.540 --> 43:20.060\nwas still he still was like looking forward to stuff like you could tell he was like I\n\n43:20.060 --> 43:24.260\ndon't know maybe I'll be King Lear I don't know it was before that point where he was\n\n43:24.260 --> 43:30.540\nlike I can't everyone gets mad when I complain he crashed a plane on a golf course and brilliantly\n\n43:30.540 --> 43:36.260\nit was all doctors were golfing that day and he crashed a plane and it was just a bunch\n\n43:36.260 --> 43:44.620\nof off-duty doctors that saw to Han Solo that's fucking there there was a there I clicked\n\n43:44.620 --> 43:50.540\non this YouTube video that was a tour of like something like it was like the headline was\n\n43:50.540 --> 44:00.100\nlike take a tour of the world's most expensive bomb shelters or something something caught\n\n44:00.100 --> 44:03.620\nmy attention it was like I don't think I'm the most expensive or they just named the\n\n44:03.620 --> 44:08.380\nprice like for $1 billion you could live here after the apocalypse or something and it was\n\n44:08.380 --> 44:16.820\nlike an abandoned military missile silo so make sense you're like oh wow cool where do\n\n44:16.820 --> 44:24.220\nyou want to be in the event of something horrible oh a re decommissioned place where they actually\n\n44:24.220 --> 44:28.020\nthought people were gonna be sitting and pushing the buttons that was nucleating the world\n\n44:28.020 --> 44:31.940\nlike like probably a good place to start with your little Lord of the Flies fantasy\n\n44:31.940 --> 44:38.260\nthe best Airbnb but it was so it was it was like the whole thing was like the intro of\n\n44:38.260 --> 44:41.780\nit the description of it was sort of like this is for rich people this is for rich people\n\n44:41.780 --> 44:48.580\nand it was like it was so depressing it was almost therapeutic because you're like yeah\n\n44:48.580 --> 44:57.580\nit like richness in the apocalypse is going to buy you literally the right maybe kind\n\n44:57.580 --> 45:04.860\nof to pull up to the entertainment weekly party of having been promised that your billion\n\n45:04.860 --> 45:10.220\ndollars is still worth anything yeah what's the currency at that point what is gold worth\n\n45:10.220 --> 45:15.220\nI swear to you I was like I when I thought about the day of like say you own you have\n\n45:15.220 --> 45:19.020\nbecause it's like a timeshare thing or like I want to not timeshare but like a condo kind\n\n45:19.020 --> 45:25.460\nof thing where you own a segment of this vast underground place and it was impressive in\n\n45:25.460 --> 45:31.740\nterms of its like I ability to keep people rich people alive for 100 years I'm it but\n\n45:31.740 --> 45:37.500\nit was a it really opened your eyes to like oh my god if your only goal is to live and\n\n45:37.500 --> 45:43.380\nyou spend all of your money on that goal it's it really looked like hell when you thought\n\n45:43.380 --> 45:47.900\nabout you're looking at the place like we have and here's our wine cellar or like you\n\n45:47.900 --> 45:54.300\nknow they would and it was like yeah but it's not you can't buy like making an underground\n\n45:54.300 --> 45:59.900\nthing and feel like freedom which is not wild and and and then and you just kept imagine\n\n45:59.900 --> 46:04.660\nI kept while I was watching the video and I just kept imagining like we can't have an\n\n46:04.660 --> 46:09.500\nelection without tearing each other's throats out we can't we can't have a 12 12 angry men\n\n46:09.500 --> 46:17.660\ncan't decide on a on a verdict yeah without fucking drama happening I life every life\n\n46:17.660 --> 46:25.700\nraft has a movie about how we're really just animals as it's subject like we can't I can't\n\n46:25.700 --> 46:31.940\nimagine voluntarily getting in my station wagon because the mushroom claws are happening\n\n46:31.940 --> 46:36.300\nor the gas got released and I'm like I got my kids that I'm in charge of protecting\n\n46:36.300 --> 46:42.100\nand my left one and I'm like let's drive to the to the place where the doomsday preppers\n\n46:42.100 --> 46:47.620\nare in charge and meanwhile people in a weird way do that every day they get in their fucking\n\n46:47.620 --> 46:52.540\ncars and they drive to the to the we are kind of in a doomsday prepper situation only we're\n\n46:52.540 --> 46:57.220\nnot underground with the rich people yet we're above ground with the rich people and we're\n\n46:57.220 --> 47:01.740\nlike trusting that everything's gonna gonna be fine even though it's clearly like people\n\n47:01.740 --> 47:07.500\ncan I have a friend she can't get her insulin anymore like she just can't get medicine she\n\n47:07.500 --> 47:13.540\nhas to drive to some place to get the medicines very expensive and already it's where that\n\n47:13.540 --> 47:17.380\nthing where you're like well what is worth anything it's like well one of the creepiest\n\n47:17.380 --> 47:22.180\nthings I have many ever many creepy things about the hot super extreme wealthy but one\n\n47:22.180 --> 47:26.260\nof the creepy things was money doesn't mean anything to them anymore because they do favors\n\n47:26.260 --> 47:29.860\nfor each other because who fucking needs money when you have billions of dollars all you\n\n47:29.860 --> 47:35.500\ncan do is favors so their currency is a currency of favors and we're the ones who are like\n\n47:35.500 --> 47:39.980\nstill into money and stuff like that and we're the ones who are hanging our coats on their\n\n47:39.980 --> 47:45.100\nbenevolence with this crazy idea that it's when everything becomes automated they're\n\n47:45.100 --> 47:49.980\ngonna treat us great we'll be fine the people have all the money they love us they'll be\n\n47:49.980 --> 47:53.980\ngreat to us because we're humans and you know they care about humans see how they treat\n\n47:53.980 --> 48:04.060\nwhen the money you paid for the right to bring your biologically viable family into a rabbit\n\n48:04.060 --> 48:09.980\nburrow that was dug by a bitcoin investor yeah when the money that you paid him for\n\n48:09.980 --> 48:16.380\nthe right to a condo in his abandoned missus silo is now officially not worth anything yeah\n\n48:16.380 --> 48:22.620\nI'm sure he's gonna be real tactful at the next dinner party like about your wife's\n\n48:22.620 --> 48:29.980\ndeck deck deck a deck a deck a tillage but like like like the off-color comments that\n\n48:29.980 --> 48:35.820\npeople make up like like when it's like oh I like I was kind of tacky to say to my girlfriend\n\n48:35.820 --> 48:43.300\nas like well wait a minute by tacky do you mean hey you could get beaten up by for that\n\n48:43.300 --> 48:49.540\nby the police that I pay for with all of my money in a world where if that doesn't happen\n\n48:49.540 --> 48:54.020\neverything's going wrong and like like that it's just like the idea of like being in an\n\n48:54.020 --> 49:01.100\nactual situation where it's nothing but fucking just primate rules I'm like I think I would\n\n49:01.100 --> 49:10.820\neat a bullet before we are in that like they like the that's what we're in yeah yeah like\n\n49:10.820 --> 49:15.500\nthe road the road do you see the road the movie the road yeah it's one of my favorites they\n\n49:15.500 --> 49:20.540\njust have like like it's almost like a Brechtian because they don't even bother to try to convince\n\n49:20.540 --> 49:26.140\nyou anything other than it's just read out the windows and he's having this conversation\n\n49:26.140 --> 49:32.140\nwith his wife about like which bullets to use with the road I've only read the book\n\n49:32.140 --> 49:37.940\nit's a film about that yeah how do you make a movie about that it's just about wandering\n\n49:37.940 --> 49:44.740\nand being like well it's just a lot of coughing you just fucking cough blood into a handkerchief\n\n49:44.740 --> 49:50.140\nand your kid gets increasingly pale and then I would rather be the guy with the shopping\n\n49:50.140 --> 49:56.380\ncart with his son wandering the desolate like wastelands and I'll collide just bullshit\n\n49:56.380 --> 50:01.740\nthan be the rich people underground I'd rather just take my chances and be mad max yeah that's\n\n50:01.740 --> 50:07.420\nwhat's fun about it not not having a bunker yeah but here's what let's make the apocalypse\n\n50:07.420 --> 50:16.820\nfun you guys yeah I think I think what both kind of saying is that is that the rich people\n\n50:16.820 --> 50:22.820\nthinking that being underground is going to make it not the shopping cart experience are\n\n50:22.820 --> 50:29.060\nso diluted and wasting so much of their energy right now not just because you can grab a shopping\n\n50:29.060 --> 50:35.620\ncart from Target right now put it in your backyard and be as prepared for what happens\n\n50:35.620 --> 50:45.340\nthe day humanity loses accountability as Elon Musk in a fucking Tokyo coffin life at the\n\n50:45.340 --> 50:49.420\ncore of the earth like who anyone around there is just going to be like he's not looking\n\n50:49.420 --> 50:55.900\nhe's got a Snickers in his pocket box cutter I think like maybe the first page of the road\n\n50:55.900 --> 51:01.860\nby Cormac McCarthy it says like it's a father and a son and I think it might be page one\n\n51:01.860 --> 51:08.020\nsays each was his other world entire like that that right there is the whole book is\n\n51:08.020 --> 51:14.180\nlike the idea that if you have somebody that you care for that's that's tragedy the back\n\n51:14.180 --> 51:21.260\nstory was that the matriarch like she had she had opted out right yeah she just walked\n\n51:21.260 --> 51:25.260\nthe way she killed herself was she just walked out into it and you were just so certain to\n\n51:25.260 --> 51:30.460\ndie that she just walked in some direction did she do it to save a bullet no I think\n\n51:30.460 --> 51:34.580\nshe just gave up she was just sort of like what's the point why are you it's just so\n\n51:34.580 --> 51:41.700\nfucking like I it's because it used to be a fun thing to think about and it's like I can't\n\n51:41.700 --> 51:45.900\nbe scientifically certain whether oh it's not fun to talk about because of our changing\n\n51:45.900 --> 51:50.820\ntimes I could easily also another thing that changes I get older and older I get more and\n\n51:50.820 --> 51:57.780\nmore I get more and more in love I more and more my hell becomes the idea of of Cody being\n\n51:57.780 --> 52:05.740\nhurt so I mean that so I that's that line the first line each was his other world entire\n\n52:05.740 --> 52:13.980\nlike that the idea that if you care for anything in an apocalypse that's instant tragedy that's\n\n52:13.980 --> 52:20.220\nwhy Spencer is always never he's never been as enthusiastic about my post election very\n\n52:20.220 --> 52:25.260\nenthusiastic like oh yeah prepping because you're basically I don't make twine you know\n\n52:25.260 --> 52:30.180\nit'll be great yeah making fishing traps but Spencer kind of like fish wait wait what you\n\n52:30.180 --> 52:36.140\nknow you like you'd use so I've seen these YouTube videos on Facebook I guess they're\n\n52:36.140 --> 52:39.740\nFacebook videos you put some you put some pipes in the water and the fish go through\n\n52:39.740 --> 52:44.100\nand then you got plenty of fish to eat we had we had a slack channel what kind of we\n\n52:44.100 --> 52:51.060\nwere using slack to coordinate a secret survivalist colony yeah it was called that babification\n\n52:51.060 --> 52:58.020\nand something Spencer at one point kind of like it was like his his is a he's more capable\n\n52:58.020 --> 53:01.580\nthan any of us like we're like relying on like well Spencer you should learn about ham\n\n53:01.580 --> 53:04.980\nradio and you should spend it's like we're all relying on Spencer and then it was like\n\n53:04.980 --> 53:10.820\nand Spencer like yeah okay yeah and like I think maybe Cody or somebody probably was\n\n53:10.820 --> 53:16.020\nlike hey Spencer you are you are you not into this you don't believe in this in this plan\n\n53:16.020 --> 53:20.140\nor that plan or you don't agree the thing and you because you were asked a direct question\n\n53:20.140 --> 53:25.340\nyou answered directly and said I love those you're like well you know I just think when\n\n53:25.340 --> 53:30.380\nthe shit hits the fan my chances of survival are going to be a lot higher by myself yeah\n\n53:30.380 --> 53:36.740\nno that's I truly think I mean that's what all the apocalypse stuff is about it's like\n\n53:36.740 --> 53:40.700\nyou join a group and then politics happens and suddenly your head's on a spike it's\n\n53:40.700 --> 53:48.020\nlike I want to just be hiding in the woods catching my fishing pipes get a shopping\n\n53:48.020 --> 53:55.260\ncart to try to leave the kid out of it if you can but I think it's funny that we all think\n\n53:55.260 --> 53:58.980\nthe world ends in a way we need that we're going to be able to go into a subterranean\n\n53:58.980 --> 54:02.500\ntunnel I know it isn't a cute that's cute because the it's just going to be some weird\n\n54:02.500 --> 54:07.180\nnanogoo that we're going to be in the middle that's going to be like try to get away there's\n\n54:07.180 --> 54:11.340\ngoing to be a nuke aimed to LA and we're going to all just be stuck in traffic I don't think\n\n54:11.340 --> 54:17.500\nit's that I think it's going to be what's happening what's happening right now is it's\n\n54:17.500 --> 54:24.540\ngoing to be one one potential way it could end is progressive layers of absurdity that\n\n54:24.540 --> 54:32.620\ndrive everyone completely insane and that starts off with this like taking you animating\n\n54:32.620 --> 54:37.460\nyou with an AI and then that AI becomes like a thousand times funnier than you right and\n\n54:37.460 --> 54:41.620\nthen it starts making its own YouTube videos but then it has an AI that's making its own\n\n54:41.620 --> 54:46.780\nYouTube videos and the first you becomes completely irrelevant so you have to deal with this kind\n\n54:46.780 --> 54:53.420\nof like my friend calls it a skits off apocalypse where everything just shatters and we all kind\n\n54:53.420 --> 55:00.060\nof end up being like lost in this tiny little sentient particles and some kind of technological\n\n55:00.060 --> 55:07.700\nkaleidoscope where we've been completely irrelevant ties by AI and then there's no by the time\n\n55:07.700 --> 55:11.340\nyou get in the tunnel you're like I don't even know if I'm me or and a version of me\n\n55:11.340 --> 55:15.980\nthat's in a tunnel and then that's I think kind of I think that's what's happening now\n\n55:15.980 --> 55:20.540\nwhy everybody's fuses are blowing and shit right now is because you know their faces\n\n55:20.540 --> 55:25.220\nare buried in the phone which by the way that's another thing when you're a parent you they\n\n55:25.220 --> 55:30.140\nkeep saying like screen time is really bad for children and at the age it's bad for them\n\n55:30.140 --> 55:35.940\nkeeps going up and up and up and you're like it doesn't stop being bad for you it's bad\n\n55:35.940 --> 55:40.300\nfor you all the way through keep your kid off of a screen until they're 28 years old\n\n55:40.300 --> 55:48.100\nwell yeah we're gonna all raise a generation of powders I mean I'm 45 but if I don't crush\n\n55:48.100 --> 55:52.740\nthe candy who's gonna crush the candy I don't know it's one of the big questions right now\n\n55:52.740 --> 55:59.140\nI've been sent here I believe I've been sent here to crush candy you gotta do it someone\n\n55:59.140 --> 56:05.420\nhas to I think it's right but what you're I think is it's notable that the phenomenon\n\n56:05.420 --> 56:12.020\nthat you're describing can be seen in an atomic level with with just our general stupidity\n\n56:12.020 --> 56:17.740\nthe fact that like and I am I'm included in this I'll be sitting at a bar and I and everyone\n\n56:17.740 --> 56:22.780\nat the bar that's arguing about some David Hasselhoff reference or what year this happened\n\n56:22.780 --> 56:29.060\nor how much money this is everyone all again we just we would rather sit and argue sometimes\n\n56:29.060 --> 56:33.580\nsome bars have rules they go like you know what the tradition of the bar argument about\n\n56:33.580 --> 56:38.500\nthe cliff clavin bullshit is so rich and important that the first person that looks at their\n\n56:38.500 --> 56:44.900\nphone is an as a traitor to the bar crawling race but it also just happens organically\n\n56:44.900 --> 56:49.820\nand not just in bars where it's like look at what we're look at what we would rather\n\n56:49.820 --> 56:56.740\ndo with our technology and I really don't mean this like in the snobby sense I if anything\n\n56:56.740 --> 57:03.740\nI'm kind of like let's really look at the fact that we were we misled ourselves in the\n\n57:03.740 --> 57:07.580\n50s and 60s when we started like splitting the atom and writing sci-fi the things about\n\n57:07.580 --> 57:12.420\nour brains getting bigger from vitamin dinners and like like to think that we really believe\n\n57:12.420 --> 57:17.940\nthat that the smarter we're able to get the smarter we're gonna want to get the more information\n\n57:17.940 --> 57:23.340\navailable to you like even in high school we were like man if this teacher would just\n\n57:23.340 --> 57:28.540\nlet me use this calculator and then the next year I was like oh you can use your calculator\n\n57:28.540 --> 57:31.620\nnow because they're everywhere and that's part of the test it's like all right well\n\n57:31.620 --> 57:35.660\nnow I don't know just take my seat it's that it but what you wanted to do is cheat on the\n\n57:35.660 --> 57:40.780\ntest with a calculator and then once it all in one day this information is all available\n\n57:40.780 --> 57:45.860\nto us we're walking around with an entire movie studio and encyclopedia of all of the\n\n57:45.860 --> 57:53.700\nearth's good like knowledge in our pockets and what we use the device for me included is we we go to\n\n57:53.700 --> 58:01.220\nsocial media gatherings and we go hey faggot hey homophobe hey fuck you faggot yeah homophobe\n\n58:01.220 --> 58:05.140\nlike and we just do it and then and then we'll like cut and paste stuff every once in a while\n\n58:05.140 --> 58:09.860\nwe'll like bother to google something ago yeah well 20 percent of the you're wrong and it's\n\n58:09.860 --> 58:19.460\nlike we we we don't want to know we don't want to be gods we don't want to be calm we don't\n\n58:19.460 --> 58:25.460\nwant to be like like we actively so what you that's like in terms of what you're saying\n\n58:25.460 --> 58:32.420\nlike that day that that Elon just launched his fucking neuro fiber thing whatever the hell\n\n58:32.420 --> 58:39.220\nit's like it's gonna he's like okay so the threads are very small and that's my impression of\n\n58:39.220 --> 58:44.020\nhim i just is that something that happened or is that hypothetical no he didn't like what's\n\n58:44.020 --> 58:48.020\nneuro fiber he did a launch for the it's a it's not it's called a neural link it's like\n\n58:48.660 --> 58:55.300\nit's for your brain to compute on yep great it's an interface device that was after that was\n\n58:55.300 --> 59:02.180\nafter you put a convertible car in space that after he took yeah and as you guys mocked him i kept\n\n59:02.180 --> 59:09.460\nsaying um anyways but like put a fucking convertible in space best midlife crisis ever man yeah no\n\n59:09.460 --> 59:16.740\nshit fucking coolest midlife is any more like apropos metaphor for a male midlife crisis\n\n59:17.460 --> 59:21.060\nthan being rich and putting a fucking car dude you know it's going to be badass when like in\n\n59:21.060 --> 59:26.420\nthousands of years some like happy little alien society is like hanging out and like the car\n\n59:26.420 --> 59:31.620\njust smashes through their alien driveway like what the fuck it's like blasted some music it's\n\n59:31.620 --> 59:37.460\ngot like a mannequin inside no but like the aliens are going to find the car and the aliens that\n\n59:37.460 --> 59:42.180\nfind the car are going to have listened to their elons and they're going to be like look it's a\n\n59:42.180 --> 59:46.820\ncar i bet they had an elon and they're gonna be like look at this cool car no there's going

like oh that's just a mannequin but it'll take like\n\n59:57.300 --> 01:00:01.300\ntwo weeks for them to find that out it'll be like a global incident for these because the\n\n01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:06.660\nuniverse will be awesome because mathematically the universe is probably infinite uh there's\n\n01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:13.940\ngoing to be a chance that elon must stupid convertible car it's going to run into another\n\n01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:20.020\nlike species car or like yeah i just explained how that would happen there's going to be a\n\n01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:25.780\nlittle oh there elon a little a little smash up which is all the more reason to launch all your\n\n01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:30.980\ngarbage cars big so that that accident is between two shitty cars that no one cares about instead\n\n01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:36.900\nof a bus full of space nuns you've created space nuns you know the mathematical certainty\n\n01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:43.220\nof douche bags and

where he like\n\n01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:07.780\ndid you see that clip or are you all right whatever i'm not dragging i don't know what you mean the\n\n01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:13.060\npresident the nazi president he had this rally a actual nazi rally in the middle of the country and\n\n01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:18.580\nwas like hey what about these chicks that are like from different places with their

because it crossed a huge threshold the people i'm i know everyone understands that\n\n01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:34.180\nit's fucking like more insanity but do you really understand the threshold that we really crossed\n\n01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:41.220\nbecause pre when previous to this anytime anybody was like trying to like be an apologist for this\n\n01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:48.580\nopenly fascist slide we're taking the way that they would apologize for it would be to go um hey uh\n\n01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:55.060\ni work i have a friend who worked for the clintons and then you have no idea man they were no better\n\n01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:59.540\nare they going hey what was obama's thing or any better and it'd be like all these things that\n\n01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:07.860\nit's like okay i like that was the bent of it was like hey it's uh it looks like a little bit like a\n\n01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:14.740\nfascist coup but uh but what do you mean that last thing wasn't fascism come on obama had those\n\n01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:23.140\ndrones um and this was like an actual crossing of a threshold where he was like these elected officials\n\n01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:32.100\nin my country that i won an election in that i have no reason to do anything about unless of\n\n01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:39.060\ncourse the actual structure of the way things work and maybe it doesn't work for me that good\n\n01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:46.260\nthese ladies represent this thing and they were like invalidate them make them not citizens\n\n01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:54.180\ntake make them go away and he was like worse than i'm gonna say it healer would have been like yeah\n\n01:13:54.180 --> 01:14:01.460\nyeah yeah and he was like i love it like he's just lazy and cowardly about it and then two\n\n01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:07.460\nyeah it was like the the the cowardice is the fucking worst part of it there's i forgive the\n\n01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:12.420\namericans in the audience who got caught up in a thing look i this podcast has been around long\n\n01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:17.140\nenough that we we could draw the parallels we were in chicago and a dear friend of mine who\n\n01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:22.660\nremains a friend of mine to this day i like like said the n-word because i asked him not to say\n\n01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:26.580\nthe n-word so he thought it'd be a funny joke to say the n-word and in response to him saying it\n\n01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:32.020\nmaybe due to some fucking zeitgeist of energy about people being afraid of their freedom of\n\n01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:37.060\nspeech being turned the crowd of people in a name for theater burst into applause for the n-word\n\n01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:41.460\ni don't i don't i doubt all of those people were racist and i don't think i'm better than them and\n\n01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:46.580\ni don't think anybody's worse crowds are allowed to act like fucking animals that's what they do\n\n01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:56.340\nlike it is a fucking horrible unamerican thing to incite that energy and then do nothing nothing\n\n01:14:56.340 --> 01:15:01.460\nat all it would be more american to fucking own it and go like yeah you heard me because then at\n\n01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:06.820\nleast you could be like oh yeah he he was caught up in it too he was a little bit american he's a\n\n01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:14.180\nfucking lazy napping child having a dream about eating his own shit and like the only thing more\n\n01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:20.260\ndangerous than anything is anything with a loaded gun that doesn't know it's loaded like he's so\n\n01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:26.020\nfucking dumb and cowardly and lazy that he's going to destroy us all anyways so i i just hear

like uh yeah see these boots these are they go up here you know\n\n01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:41.060\nbecause uh snakebots they're pretty bad i'm gonna kill i'm gonna kill a hundred thousand people\n\n01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:48.580\nand it's like you know it's like whoa he's but at the end of this press tour he says this thing\n\n01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:53.620\nto the reporters he's like you know i don't appreciate a lot of what what you said about me\n\n01:16:53.620 --> 01:17:00.100\nin the press but i i respect all of you's people and i was like i i was like that that's gone that\n\n01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:04.260\nused to be that used to be part of the fucking i mean i guess we've become our dads maybe because\n\n01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:11.300\nnow i can't tell the difference between like like oh old people get old and then they go you know\n\n01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:16.420\nwhat you used to call boring stodgy stuff now and then you just start deciding well that's\n\n01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:20.740\nacross the line but i don't i don't think that's the case i believe we're in a constitutional\n\n01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:27.460\ncrisis because i believe the previous to this the the fucking left and right margins contained\n\n01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:37.860\num uh things like the the the the right for a fucking free press and an actual need for them\n\n01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:42.180\nlike there was this tradition and it was actually part of what disillusioned us i think is because\n\n01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:46.180\nit felt rhetorical because well if you really believe that then why are you why are you acting\n\n01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:51.060\nthe way you act why are you bombing this country and then sitting at this correspondence dinner\n\n01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:59.060\nand saying uh uh to quote uh jfk uh the the press is right to to defy me it was more about you\n\n01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:03.140\nknow it's it was also rhetorical feeling and it was like oh this all means nothing and i think\n\n01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:08.020\nthat's part of the excitement when someone goes you know what is it me or is all of this just a\n\n01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:12.980\nbunch of poopy doopies and and everyone's like poopy doopies and they're like like let's see if\n\n01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:17.460\nit is let's find out if it's poopy doopies and then the and then everyone's like it's not poopy\n\n01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:22.980\ndoopies you will report to detention once and then i'm like what if we didn't ah poopy doopies\n\n01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:30.820\nand it's a fucking crisis because it turns out ain't no reason it ain't poopy doopies or\n\n01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.500\nand there ain't nothing to make anyone go to detention and it was actually we were we were\n\n01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:39.860\nactually being held together with the fucking weird compulsion for rule of law yeah well you know\n\n01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:46.420\nthat creepy thing in the home and there's that great movie funny games where you know what i'm\n\n01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:51.700\ntalking about the original or the ream the american i i thought you were getting game game night wrong\n\n01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:57.380\nno no no i thought you were like my parents are like what a movie is funny games is awesome\n\n01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:02.100\nhome and it's about these two kids show up and they're weird in there they're causing problems\n\n01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:06.820\noh that oh god that's it yes it's solid but you don't want to believe it you don't want to believe\n\n01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:11.300\nthat you're getting home invaded so you're kind of like okay okay well maybe you guys are just a\n\n01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:16.740\nlittle off and by the time you're like tied up with your husband whose knee is being broken\n\n01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:21.060\nand then and then you know you realize like oh fuck i got home invaded like this is really\n\n01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:24.980\nhappening yeah and then you're supposed to spend the rest of your short life as you're being dumped\n\n01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:29.220\ninto a pond with a cement block tied your neck you're supposed to sit there and wonder your dying\n\n01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:33.780\nthought is should i have clubbed a random child in the head as soon as he showed up on my porch i\n\n01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:38.500\nguess i should have been really very hateful and mistrustful that was my big mistake was trusting\n\n01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:43.620\npeople oh gosh darn me i guess that's why i'm dying a horrible death like that's the horrible thing\n\n01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:48.660\nabout evil is the way it spreads is like really should have it's like i'm not touching you i'm not\n\n01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:54.740\ntouching you you're like anybody that's like been in a car with kids knows like that antagonism has\n\n01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:59.540\nits own sentience even the it's like like are you getting mad are you getting mad because\n\n01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:03.860\nthere's no wrong answer to that question you're either gonna let me keep fucking with you or\n\n01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:07.940\nyou're gonna blow your stack and prove that i should have been fucking with you well cowardice\n\n01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:13.300\nyou can't be like p it's not some people i think confuse their their their their cowardice of benevolence\n\n01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:18.020\nand it's it's not you're not benevolent you're just afraid and usually the the situation is when\n\n01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:24.420\nyou're afraid to just cause for a confrontation like they're saying now people watched epstein\n\n01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:29.700\nflying all these underage kids to his island way after he got convicted there's a ruin you know\n\n01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:35.620\nnews report like the people like i we kept seeing him with these kids and it seemed really bad nothing\n\n01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:42.820\nhappened they didn't they they're they're something i think in a in a person in general gets feel so\n\n01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:48.660\nlittle sometimes are so insignificant that you don't want to fight back and so that's we know what\n\n01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:55.220\nfosters all of the horrible shit that's happening is like in these closed systems where your job's\n\n01:20:55.220 --> 01:21:01.300\nat stake you keep a secret and then you're there's blasphemy that can happen in the sense that if you\n\n01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:07.620\nsay the thing about the person who's supposed to be okay it could destroy oh my god it could destroy\n\n01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:14.020\nthe business the family a you know a religion or whatever right so a sensible person does nothing\n\n01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:19.220\nbut yeah that's what i'm saying yeah i'm not being ironic saying that it's like a sensible person\n\n01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:25.140\ndoes less than a less reasonable person well you are saying antagonism has like its own\n\n01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:30.740\nsentience or spirit in the same way this level of i think um turning your back on a thing even\n\n01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:36.100\nthough it's clearly happening right in front of you it has its own spirit too and and and when\n\n01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:43.140\nyou when you realize that there's people who literally thrive on that reality and not not\n\n01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:49.220\nexploit it i mean this is like a con artistry is find a person you know they want to be nice\n\n01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:53.300\nthat's the first mark against them is like oh shit they're just afraid and they think they're\n\n01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:58.580\ngood people so i'm going to come to them i'm going to like hypnotize them get them invested\n\n01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:03.460\nin whatever my bullshit is and then i'm just going to you know turn them into my slaves humiliate\n\n01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:07.540\nthem take everything from them and then by the time i'm done they're going to pretend it didn't\n\n01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:11.780\nhappen because they they're from the midwest or whatever you said they didn't want to be\n\n01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:16.340\nrubes so they're going to ignore that they even got fucked with and then that's what produces\n\n01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:22.420\nthe situation i think where people that take over a cool party by doing a bunch of crazy\n\n01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:29.460\nfucking shit they had nothing to lose they were not the cool person at the party so kicking over\n\n01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:35.460\nan ashtray jumping off the roof in your underwear into the pool like it causing the cops to get\n\n01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:43.460\ncalled like it didn't those people they don't take risks they only enter win-win situations\n\n01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:50.100\nthey they flow to the lowest point of of of human pathway where they're like well actually\n\n01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:57.300\nthat was like when when when this shit bag was was was running he was constantly blowing that\n\n01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:03.380\nhorn because he would go i don't think i'm gonna win because probably everyone else is cheating\n\n01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:09.860\nbut if i do win it's because i'm awesome and it was like like oh are you sure you don't want to\n\n01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:15.060\ncover a couple more bases you fucking three-year-old like really you don't want to stick your neck out\n\n01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:19.300\na little bit like as much as you did when you tried to sentence five black kids to die in the\n\n01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:23.700\nfucking whatever man all right i'm done i'm done i'm done i'm done i mean it's not like we all know\n\n01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:27.940\nthe fight it's like like he's going to win again i'm trying yeah yeah we don't have to we don't\n\n01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:31.540\nhave to bump people out with that i and i didn't i was like he was gonna win the first time he's\n\n01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:35.620\ngoing to win the second time there's no fucking reason to doubt that there's no fucking reason\n\n01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:43.700\nthis stuff is only valuable to us in as much as it causes us to have conversations that you know\n\n01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:49.940\ni i obviously you guys have more than enough people talking to you about everything that's\n\n01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:55.140\ngoing on and like i i'm not the person it's not that's why i've been more and more quiet about\n\n01:23:55.140 --> 01:24:01.940\npolitics with every passing episode because it's like i'm not helping by talking about it and\n\n01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:08.340\ni had a driver in canada in canada in saskatchewan which is like like the oklahoma of canada\n\n01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:15.460\nuh it's it's very rural it's very like red steady like if you know like that's the comparison to\n\n01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:23.700\nlike like it's they hate justin trudeau our driver nice guy funny guy he said yeah he said i want\n\n01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:30.420\nto shoot him shoot trudeau yeah and i said well you sound like you're from texas he goes yeah but\n\n01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:36.580\nin texas they let us they would let you have guns like like they hate justin trudeau because he's\n\n01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:42.180\nhe's the he's the liberal smart guy that speaks three languages and is charming uh like like\n\n01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:48.180\nit's fucking nasty everywhere you go and the idea that you don't think that trump will win again is\n\n01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:54.420\ncrazy well you know uh i think you're probably right um and i'm sorry were you about to make\n\n01:24:54.420 --> 01:25:00.020\nanother no no no the end uh we're all going to watch trump get a fucking second term because\n\n01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:04.740\nthere's no reason to assume otherwise but that's a but i don't want to let you go on that but but\n\n01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:10.980\nlike that's all but you can say that in a positive way like like like like we we we we all get to\n\n01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:15.300\nvote our conscience this time around like we don't have to like like let's not get sucked into the\n\n01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:20.740\ngame of like uh made possibly like yelling at our friends about like well you know if you don't vote\n\n01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:26.100\nfor a fucking generic uh johnson then we have no chance of winning it's like it might be an invitation\n\n01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:32.100\nto for people to explore new ways of thinking but yeah that's what you're saying that's what i like uh\n\n01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:40.100\numma thurman's dad a lot of people don't here we go robert no i'm glad we finally got on this\n\n01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:44.660\nto get to the conversations that that's what i took us an hour and a half when we finally made\n\n01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:49.700\nit his there are dads like this really amazing buddhist scholar named robert thurman and he's\n\n01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:53.940\nlike best friends with the dalai lama and he's written a lot of great books on uh buddhism and\n\n01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:59.780\npolitics and buddhism and activism because people don't realize that the two go hand in hand but\n\n01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:06.260\nbut i was so i love that he named his kid umma because he's so buddhist his kids named him robert\n\n01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:16.820\nhe became a buddhist and his daughter umma actor well he his he was saying that we can't get cynical\n\n01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:21.540\nlike uh it right now is the perfect time to get super cynical and if you get super cynical you're\n\n01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:26.900\ngonna get shut down if you get shut down that's exactly where they want you because they want\n\n01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:34.180\ncynical pessimistic shut down people who get so glumified by the current political system\n\n01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:39.300\nthat no one votes you just give up and not just vote in the in the big elections but just vote in\n\n01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:45.140\nlocal elections and get really involved in in your community because you can pass stuff\n\n01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:50.260\nat the state level that creates at least many force fields to in some way or another i mean if\n\n01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:55.460\nthat shit's not more important than the fucking dumb reality show at the top then we wouldn't be\n\n01:26:55.460 --> 01:27:03.060\nalive right now and the guy at the top wouldn't be focusing his fucking nuclear dipshitness on\n\n01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:07.860\nlocal representatives of fucking neighborhoods where they were unduly elected by their own\n\n01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:13.860\nconstituency who probably look and think like them like like like like that it is because the whole\n\n01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:20.580\nshtick of thinking locally acting locally is so it is the huge threat you can't you can't stand at\n\n01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:27.380\none of those rallies and make everyone in portland stop making their own cheese i ran out of ways to\n\n01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:34.500\neveryone go make their own cheese i don't i i was like that that the those representatives are\n\n01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:40.740\nlike look at the inverse relationship they have they represent something no pun intended like\n\n01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:46.340\nand and it's it's a it's drawing a thing from that party they're going here's our strategy\n\n01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:52.820\nbecause we have no opposition on the left in terms of like a mecca godzilla to our godzilla\n\n01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:59.460\nwhich is actually a problem for them because if people get fatigued as they very well might of\n\n01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:05.060\na fucking autocrat they might just actually find it more appealing for a jimmy carter to just step\n\n01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:11.300\nup and be like hey i like the taste of fucking graham crackers and milk i don't need any more of this\n\n01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:18.500\nshit i'm fucking tired god damn you wore out my racist bone um i i i i i i i didn't tell my mom\n\n01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:25.140\ni i pretended i voted for trump but i i secretly voted for jimmy carter because i'm tired of being\n\n01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:32.420\nracist i got so racist last eight years it hurt anyways but um like that is why because they you\n\n01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:37.140\ncould his instinct everyone's like oh it's a distraction for the epstein thing that that\n\n01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:41.220\nguy's never done delayed gratification in his life like he doesn't he's not like oh i think i'll think\n\n01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:49.060\none thing and not say it um he what he's doing is very organic and natural he's like i only understand\n\n01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:54.900\nfighting and he's like joe biden's not worth fighting if he fights joe biden he looks like a\n\n01:28:54.900 --> 01:29:01.780\nfucking dummy he's gonna be like oh sleepy joe it's gonna it's only gonna inflate and so he's like\n\n01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:08.180\nthese socialists these women of color like he want that their whole camp like is going um\n\n01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:17.460\nthese faces this identity politics is powerful it can displace us and so that's a that's an\n\n01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:24.740\nuplifting thought they're scared of it they believe that uh one skywalker can blow up a death star\n\n01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:30.100\nthey are very worried about it yeah i i that's i that's my i mean that's my hope i that's always\n\n01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:35.940\nbeen every that's what we hope for for sure yeah i i i went through a real shitty like dark cynical\n\n01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:41.380\nperiod and then realized i'm like oh this is one of the great things i'll be married my wife was\n\n01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:45.700\nlike you know you're a hundred percent wrong about all your political predictions because i've been\n\n01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:51.620\nlike just like making but she said that to you yeah and i realized that like yeah a couple of\n\n01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:55.780\nyears ago i've been wrong about literally everything political to realize that like you don't\n\n01:29:55.780 --> 01:30:00.980\nunderstand geopolitics i don't understand geopolitics it's not i just don't know that doesn't mean we\n\n01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:07.460\nshouldn't interact with it but the thing i at least have been trying to do is like in my own home\n\n01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:15.860\ntry to not bring

isms will\n\n01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:25.460\nwork like maybe we can make find a socialism that works a communism that works a capitalism that\n\n01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:32.100\nworks a little elon musk

to form a lethal cum cloud around the earth it'll instantly disperse in a\n\n01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:52.980\nspherical pattern it'll block it'll block the fight him indeed you're one of those musk jizz\n\n01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:57.540\nhoarders that wants to keep it in the balloon i'm saying let's disperse the musk jizz i would\n\n01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:01.940\nlike you're a party man but we're thinking about the end of the world you got to get those jizz\n\n01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:08.740\nballoons down in your bunker wait for a special occasion pop those jizz balloons right now but\n\n01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:16.260\nthat's i think there's a that's the you see i'm gonna pop the balloon man you guys deflected uh\n\n01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:22.100\nyou you you guys want to keep that's your problem Duncan you want to you want to keep the jizz inside\n\n01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:28.900\nthe balloon sure it's a why because it came from elon musk's dick yeah but you know but what if you\n\n01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:34.260\nhad thomas Edison's jizz i would let i would pop that balloon too you would have made the worst\n\n01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:40.100\nmistake of your life you're gonna pop a balloon you're one of those people that wants to hoard\n\n01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:45.540\njizz balloons of geniuses and you want to hoard genius jizz and balloons i would like the woolly\n\n01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:50.980\nmammoth to come back right but you would keep it in a balloon and not not you wouldn't you pop that\n\n01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:55.060\njeff the whole point of putting elon musk's jizz in a balloon and launching it into space is not\n\n01:31:55.060 --> 01:32:03.700\nso that it surrounds the earth elon can surround the earth with jizz from home we need to get his\n\n01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:10.900\njizz out of orbit where it can pop around okay venus for so you want to pop the balloon eventually\n\n01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:15.060\nwell the balloon i hope will pop on itself okay that that's that's all i'm saying all i'm saying\n\n01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:22.900\nbut you want to be outside and it starts raining musk jizz i wanted to rain genius jizz all over\n\n01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:32.500\nmy face what do you think this podcast is you've been you've been living in your own paradise this\n\n01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:46.020\nwhole time you're soaking wet baby um i did not to drag it back to the less fun thing and i'm not\n\n01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:49.780\ni'm not i'm not i'm not doing that entirely i want to actually just get the one fruitful thing\n\n01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:57.060\nout of that because what you said suggest that one thing which is it we can it's like it's that\n\n01:32:57.060 --> 01:33:02.100\nit's the whole awareness thing and it's this idea of like oh i'm wrong i'm wrong about everything\n\n01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:06.980\nlike like it's and it's okay to be wrong which is like that's why i was like those people chanting\n\n01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:11.460\nthe thing at a rally like who cares they're a crowd they change to something at a rally the\n\n01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:15.940\ncustomer is always right they're americans they have freedom of speech they're allowed to have a\n\n01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:21.540\nfucking weird dumb joke get out of control we're not we they don't need to be rounded up and and\n\n01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:27.380\ninvestigated there's a fucking dude right up there in a system that we designed for that purpose\n\n01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:33.220\nwho has a chance to react to it and chooses the worst fucking possible path through that interaction\n\n01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:40.980\nand and so our way of fighting it uh in big air quotes is like is actually just being like oh what\n\n01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:46.420\ndid i learn from all of this shit last couple years i am for me using my eye statements it's\n\n01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:54.740\nlike i learned that i had a huge intolerance for being out of control for like i like i you know\n\n01:33:54.740 --> 01:34:02.820\nlike just like it boy was i like fucking addicted to like controlling the fucking world it was crazy\n\n01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:09.460\nhow unable i was to handle the concept that that that shit wasn't gonna go my way tomorrow and like\n\n01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:16.020\ni like i only got a teaspoon of it and i reacted in a way that made all of the women in my life\n\n01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:20.740\nall of the people of color in my life frankly which i like like they're like welcome to the party\n\n01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:24.980\nand it was like okay that's good because when that line is said and die hard marks the beginning of\n\n01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:33.380\nan alliance that saves Nakatomi Plaza and sometimes it has to start with a dead body\n\n01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:37.220\nbreaking a windshield of a guy that just wanted to have twinkies and i know it's confusing because\n\n01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:44.820\ni'm actually the black guy in that metaphor uh i don't know man like you know i i want it to be\n\n01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:51.300\ngreat you know i love the idea of like yeah we can all i love the i'm gonna stay optimistic all\n\n01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:57.620\nthe way until i'm getting my head chopped off and thank you very much put on a pike now i mean i\n\n01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:02.100\njust want to point out you know the the smattering of applause you get when you praise optimism\n\n01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:09.940\nit's from a bunch of optimists you're right they're easy clappers we've always known this people\n\n01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:16.900\nthey're easy clappers yeah there they go there they go easy clappers\n\n01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:23.860\nbut hey you can still i'm you get your optimism doesn't mean being weak or optimism doesn't mean\n\n01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:30.180\nhaving to be all like flowery and full of shit or whatever it's like you can you can optimistically\n\n01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:36.580\nyou know that's that great book man search for meaning by victor franco where he's like in oschwitz\n\n01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:44.660\nand like within that situation he still finds a way to maintain a belief in like humanity as being\n\n01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:50.420\na positive plus beautiful thing on the planet even in the midst of all that so if he could do it\n\n01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:58.420\ni'm certain that that we can do it in this insane revolting and turbulent weird time right now it's\n\n01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:04.180\njust i think to for me it just means like i can't do anything about those fucking rallies like i can't\n\n01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:08.900\ndo anything about that i can't do anything about they kind of hope you'd try i mean that's a whole\n\n01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:16.420\nit's as simple as biological physics like that's what a cell any membrane is it's like this uh\n\n01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:22.660\nbio lipid uh what's bio fuck i forgot that god damn it's like like cell membranes are just made of\n\n01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:27.940\na thing that is it likes water on one side and it hates water on the other and it naturally forms\n\n01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:35.940\na membrane around a thing it's like it they need to have their rally not to sorry to interrupt but\n\n01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:41.060\ni just like like like like if i was sorry i interrupted why did i i don't know i mean i was\n\n01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:46.900\nlike desperately searching for some like nice cap on the shit when it's like i don't know man this\n\n01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:51.620\nstuff happens super fast look what happened in iran it can happen just like that and all of a\n\n01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:55.220\nsudden everyone's getting arrested and the next thing you know shits on fire and you didn't\n\n01:36:55.220 --> 01:37:00.020\ndo anything is what were you going to do anyway and you're fucked i mean really if you look at\n\n01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:05.380\ntaiwan as an example of what you're supposed to do and then look at us you see like the difference\n\n01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:09.700\nlike they understand it enough to know oh we're going to get out there and we're not going to\n\n01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:14.900\nsleep and we're going to get shot in the face and we're going to like get beaten by thugs because\n\n01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:21.620\nwe so don't want to have our freedom encroached upon anymore than it already is and we're kind of\n\n01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:28.260\nlike uh well as long as no one's racist yeah we uh kind of i mean yeah because we haven't\n\n01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:33.140\nbecause we haven't yet hit that point you know tarence mckinnon said that thing where the apocalypse\n\n01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:38.180\nis already happening it just hadn't gotten to the united states yet it's like when it's when it finally\n\n01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:43.940\ncomes then then you know people tend to act because i i do have this fantasy of like shit if we all\n\n01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:50.100\njust did go like yellow vest or whatever and we really did it and we went into the streets\n\n01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:54.740\nand we're like yeah we don't want it anymore and we really started like setting shit on fire and\n\n01:37:54.740 --> 01:38:00.020\nreally like doing what you're supposed to do when things are really bad i think it would change\n\n01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:05.380\nreally it would change pretty fast well yeah if everyone did anything yeah change real fast yeah\n\n01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:11.620\nbut that but that's to me that's like if if like you're a lion tamer and and human like all of us\n\n01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:16.740\nas a whole are the lion then you want to keep the lion entertaining i guess you want to keep it active\n\n01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:22.100\nbut you don't want it to remember what it's a lion and we went because the moment that happens\n\n01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:27.860\nand people remember oh if we organize and take to the streets should change as fast it's all over\n\n01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:34.260\nfor them usually it's like a bad thing but if you can keep the lion just you know pissed off give it\n\n01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:40.420\na couple of swipes let it growl here and there but mostly keep it kind of sedated and busy typing\n\n01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:46.660\nand looking at its fucking instagram or whatever then you can just do whatever you want to the lion\n\n01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:54.260\nyou can fuck the lion you can milk the lion for its sweet jizz and add it to your weird gross\n\n01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:59.620\nsemen balloon collection and then jeff will come over and pop it i got everybody like everybody\n\n01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:06.180\nlights up when we get back on that track they're like come on get back to that thing and the\n\n01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:10.740\ncynicism is like what caused all the problem in the first place this hopeless sense of cynicism\n\n01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:15.620\nwhich is like nothing i do is gonna matter it's all the same if everyone instead of doing that\n\n01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:20.100\nwere like i'm gonna do the best possible thing for the situation none of it would have devolved\n\n01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:25.140\nbut it had done people have thought that for like hundreds of years and it created this untenable\n\n01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:29.300\nsituation cynical thoughts are there and they should be acknowledged i think that's a huge\n\n01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:33.300\nlesson that we that we learned and i was resistant to that message because the last thing i wanted\n\n01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:38.260\nto hear after the day i learned that i didn't control the world and then i had backed the wrong\n\n01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:44.260\nhorse and that it was good so you know it was like i was so fucking sick of the fucking think pieces\n\n01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:49.940\nabout you know i forgot the rust belt but we what we did forget was we forgot we forgot that every\n\n01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:55.700\nsingle person was like it yeah we did we did enter a world where we're like actually like you\n\n01:39:55.700 --> 01:40:00.900\nknow what there's such a thing as dismissible people and we that was working for us economically\n\n01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:05.700\nup to a certain point and then and then it and then it became a thing that you could launch a\n\n01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:10.980\nplatform off of some fucking dude was like oh all this fucking human flotsam you can actually turn\n\n01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:17.060\nthat all into one big mac anyways i'm mixing metaphors or maybe not i don't know much about\n\n01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:24.580\nbig macs but the um i do think that yeah cynicism doesn't need to you don't need to choose between\n\n01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:32.420\nbeing cynical which is the the fucking belief that things are going to tend to go from high to low\n\n01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:42.020\nhot to cold yeah like like like cynicism is reality tragedy is a thing that is but cynicism\n\n01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:50.900\ncauses the inaction but it's like yeah we we it's the the people that the people that are trying\n\n01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:57.540\nto trick us into thinking you have to choose between polyanna and nihilism um are they don't\n\n01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:02.020\nhave our best interests at heart because we've been living this long by finding a way to split\n\n01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:07.940\nthe difference we know goddamn well that life doesn't mean shit and but we are here because\n\n01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:18.020\npeople that had bleaker lives than we did um like grabbed their fucking bayonets blenders of\n\n01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:24.740\nparticle accelerators what their weapon of choice in the war against chaos and they found order\n\n01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:30.340\nthey they yeah so there's a lot of delusion to being a human i feel like we're fucking monkeys\n\n01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:36.260\nthat talk it's not worth much if you really think about it which we're the only animal that can and\n\n01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:42.020\nso we shouldn't and it's like it's a fucking bummer and so we make up stories and sound clouds and\n\n01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:50.020\nstuff to cope with it it is it is crucial to find that middle ground that to to to refuse the temptation\n\n01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:56.260\nto someone telling you no at the end of the day you're either this or you're that that's the sign\n\n01:41:56.260 --> 01:42:03.060\nof somebody that's probably trying to trying to box you in and you can have joyful cynicism like\n\n01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:10.020\nthe idea like cynicism is so fun like when you hit a nice cynical cynical pitch and you're really\n\n01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:15.700\njust fucking just slashing the throat of the world and as long as you just can really enjoy it and\n\n01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:20.980\nrecognize like this isn't all that i am but god damn if i don't have a nice throbbing vein of\n\n01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:27.140\ncynicism pumping through me at all times you get to have your cynicism and you're right when sun\n\n01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:33.940\nwhen a son of a bitch at some fucking yoga studio tries to like get you to overcome your cynicism\n\n01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:41.140\nlike it's bad or something fuck that that's the devil like you start calling yourself yeah it\n\n01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:47.300\nit well it's gonna cause don't listen to him you react and this is the most uplifting thing about\n\n01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:53.300\nhumans is that you react to that with fury yeah if you're feeling like self-loathing or these\n\n01:42:53.300 --> 01:43:00.100\nthings that we label as unhealthy you're like you say in front of a yoga guy um i'm so such a piece\n\n01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:03.620\nof shit i ate a philly cheese steak last night i shouldn't have done that and like like the the\n\n01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:09.460\nkind of people that go like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa stop stop stop everything\n\n01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:17.540\nthink different it is the good part of every american that's like no stop stopping stop\n\n01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:21.780\ntelling me to let this play out it's archie bunker it's cartman it's gonna fucking flow like lava\n\n01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:26.420\nmake a mountain and change the landscape like what like let it be over if you truly believe it's\n\n01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:31.540\nlike fruitless like i'm not suggesting we go into the streets and take care of my fatness with the\n\n01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:39.060\nfinal solution i'm momentarily running out this fucking lobe in my brain that's like i'm a piece\n\n01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:44.820\nof shit i fucking fail and there are ways to like grab the person next to you when they're\n\n01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:52.260\nyou know cody's in that space right now or dog is fucking terribly ill and she's she's she's\n\n01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:57.540\nshe's she's she's in this awful place and it's like it's almost it's like a drug trip\n\n01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:04.180\ncoaching kind of thing where i'm like i'm i mean she probably he it's probably isn't working but\n\n01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:12.340\nlike i i'm always saying to her like you can feel that feeling just don't you just don't act on it\n\n01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:17.380\nit's it like it's it's just like yeah it's like like don't argue with people that they're not feeling\n\n01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:22.340\nshitty because then they're like fuck you i definitely know i am like you're full you're\n\n01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:27.540\nhorseshit you're well yeah because people don't want it like you want to one of those liberating\n\n01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:32.340\nthings i figured out well i didn't figure out so it's a i think it's a buddhist idea something\n\n01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:36.420\ni chug him tromba talks about a little bit i think this is a safe place for you to just take\n\n01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:41.380\ncredit for it okay i invented this i came up with a thing called buddhism it's pretty fucking cool\n\n01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:45.860\nfour noble don't don't call it buddhism you're just gonna get caught up in court for five thousand\n\n01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:54.500\nyears it's this idea of like uh sometimes things just suck and that's it so instead of trying to\n\n01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:59.300\nput lipstick on the suck or trying to like put a little wig on the suck and you're like yeah\n\n01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:04.660\nyou know like i learned so much from um getting one of my balls chopped off it was really a great\n\n01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:09.700\ntrue story all that stuff it's like which is okay to do it's not to say that you you don't learn\n\n01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:15.060\nfrom your trauma or whatever but a lot of times you'll get around these like trauma cops who when\n\n01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:19.700\nyou're finally getting to the point of overcoming the guilt you're feeling about being angry whoever\n\n01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:25.220\nthe the thing was or whatever it was and you're finally feeling this pure anger someone will come\n\n01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:32.340\nto you and be like but maybe you should you know zoom out a little bit from the anger and just\n\n01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:38.580\nunderstand that there's a way to really love the whatever the fucking thing is you know you could\n\n01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:48.020\njust truly and it's like no fuck that it sucked period that's it i had two whole balls yeah i had\n\n01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:54.020\ntwo i know i've had this many i had one it's worse mom gone dad gone you know what i mean we're gonna\n\n01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:58.020\nlose everyone everyone's gonna fucking die and for real gonna die and they're gonna die before\n\n01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:02.340\nyou expect them to you're gonna get a phone call and the person's dead before you expected it it's\n\n01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:06.180\nnot when you think and you're gonna die before you expect you and the way you die is not the way\n\n01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:10.500\nyou thought it would be like in the movies where you look like you look like you just got back from\n\n01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:17.300\nthe gym or some shit and you fall asleep no you're gonna become a drooling daughtering thing\n\n01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:23.300\nspinning through time sweating profusely confused like i think i'm awake what's where's danny should\n\n01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:30.180\nwe go to the car leasing station or whatever you're just gonna fucking croak and that sucks\n\n01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:36.500\nperiod just accept that that sucks for me that's been the most liberating thing to be like oh yeah\n\n01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:42.260\nit does just get to suck and then within that somewhere there's a sense of like i think i can\n\n01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:48.500\nfucking do this optimism shit but i can't do it without the suck first i'm hungry for it now exactly\n\n01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:55.060\nexactly i smoked the box of cigars in the closet of like i think there might need not be a god like\n\n01:46:55.060 --> 01:47:00.100\nyou can't just force feed people yeah like like over and over again like i don't know don't let that\n\n01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:03.780\nin your head well that's called you know that's what they call spiritual bypass so it's it's the\n\n01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:09.540\nidea is like it's basically like if i put on an outfit like i graduated from college i graduated\n\n01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:16.420\nfrom college but first you have to go through this like just a real swamp of like not good and not\n\n01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:22.660\nnot good not like movie not good or not not good where there's like gonna be a thing at the end\n\n01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:28.660\nof the not good where it's like oh see now we did we did it and now the puzzle pieces fit no it just\n\n01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:34.260\nisn't good and that's it and it doesn't get better it's actually called hopelessness and it's really\n\n01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:39.700\none of the most beautiful things ever to finally become absolutely hopeless because uh that means\n\n01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:44.580\nthat you're not torturing yourself anymore with a fantasy of the way things could be that's pretty\n\n01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:53.860\ngreat and i advise it for anyone to become absolutely completely hopeless but that's where\n\n01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:59.300\noptimism starts optimism grows from the soil of hopelessness in the most beautiful way because if\n\n01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:04.980\nthe universe exists and it was created by a any kind of sentient deity can you imagine how hopeless\n\n01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:10.980\nthat motherfucker must have been in order to create bother to create hope out of thin air like that\n\n01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:18.500\nmust have been a sad piece of shit like like who's like like like oh um genuinely absolutely 100\n\n01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:22.420\npercent positive that there's no meaning to life at all because here i am and there's nothing if i\n\n01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:27.380\ndon't do it and then like i think i'll fuck with that because then i wanted hope i want to create\n\n01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:35.300\nthe idea of mortality right that's that's and so and so you're hopeless he's a serial killer your\n\n01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:40.340\nhopelessness is your atonement with the with the cosmic entity it's like whether if you're an atheist\n\n01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:46.180\nthen that means nothingness your hopelessness is you aligning as raccoons and drafts cannot no\n\n01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:55.380\nmatter what they tell you your sentence allows you to align with the unliving impersonal cosmic\n\n01:48:55.380 --> 01:49:02.580\nbulldozer that was so selfish and shitty and scared and that it made the universe you use the\n\n01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:08.340\nthose moments when you're when you've got that that gun in your mouth and you don't know who to\n\n01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:14.580\ntalk to and stuff it's like if you can just scrape that bottom of the pool and just come back up and\n\n01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:20.500\ndo time just don't do the permanent thing don't don't do the thing that you mean are you talking\n\n01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:26.500\nabout suicide don't kill yourself yeah that's an easy stance to take isn't it well well i mean yes\n\n01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:30.820\nand i know like don't do the permanent thing but the the other for me like the i think suicide\n\n01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:38.500\nis man it's a gamble because you are i thought i really just had the easy point of view on this\n\n01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:43.540\nno i'm saying like kids if you haven't contemplated suicide you know i would be that would be\n\n01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:48.020\nsurprising to me so any i think anyone who's sentient and experiencing suffering and wants to\n\n01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:52.340\nfind exits that's the first thing that pops into your head so i've thought about it a lot and uh\n\n01:49:53.460 --> 01:50:00.020\nmy conclusion is oh well it's uncertain about what happens upon extinction like for example if we knew\n\n01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:05.460\nthat we somehow had some way to really show sentience is based on neurobiology and\n\n01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:09.540\nwhen you kill yourself there is a pure extinguishment of all identity it kind of like\n\n01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:15.380\nwhat dockens calls death is the anesthesia that saves us from the pain of eternity stuff like\n\n01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:21.220\nwe get fully put under she's there's no coming back he's um not the band dog oh i was like okay all\n\n01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:26.340\nright well i gotta i gotta revisit my done docking you've never heard that docking stuff\n\n01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:34.100\ni'm just fucked up damn time warriors i i have to go back and re-listen to that before\n\n01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:40.900\nthey're uh but you're assuming street three soundtrack they all right continue sorry to me\n\n01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:46.740\nit's like what if you kill yourself and the momentum of the pain that you're experiencing that drove\n\n01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:54.340\nyou to do self-violence continues into some uh liminal bardo state and that momentum brings\n\n01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:59.620\nyou into another incarnation then you're just in this never-ending cycle so it was a failed attempt\n\n01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:05.380\nit didn't work so it doesn't it didn't solve the problem and so to me that's a good that that definitely\n\n01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:10.180\nhas kept me from i guess that's an interesting like kept you from what like killing myself it's a\n\n01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:14.340\nit's like jesus fucking christ do you know when you jump out the window and you're like\n\n01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:20.340\nfantasizing like maybe when i jump out the pavement turns into like a lake or something and i dive into\n\n01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:26.260\nnothingness how do you know you don't just suddenly come to and you're driving like a metro bus having\n\n01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:32.900\na deja vu or this nature of time and consciousness is so variable that it's the moment that your skull\n\n01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:38.580\nimpacts with the pavement that actually gets protracted into a subjective eternity yeah like\n\n01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:44.180\nexactly some like yeah infinite ketamine like agony moment that goes on and on and on you the\n\n01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:49.300\npoint is we just don't know and and because of that it seems like or what i've been taught is it's\n\n01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:55.540\nbetter to work on extinguishing the illusion of the identity rather than the physical body because\n\n01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:59.380\nthe physical body is actually a secondary consideration i wish we had started here instead\n\n01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:03.860\nof almost ending here because this is such an interesting thing maybe maybe we both just got\n\n01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:09.700\ntoo drunk but uh the but because what i would i would want to add to that is i'm you're that's\n\n01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:18.500\nvery interesting and clever to come up with a logical reason not to do it but i see as the\n\n01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:25.540\nbig problem is the search for logic and then when people feel like they lose their logic they feel\n\n01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:34.340\nthen tempted it's the pain of of directionlessness and like uh just that emptiness where where you're\n\n01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:40.020\nlike well i it hurts and i think that's a really interesting thing about humans is that our neutral\n\n01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:48.500\ngill gear gill holy shit let's work we're almost done folks i that our neutral gear is painful to us\n\n01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:53.780\nif we're not engaged we're actually feeling wrong we're feeling eaten alive by like these weird\n\n01:52:54.820 --> 01:53:00.980\ncyber christ nano insects from lawnmower man and like um like just just watch it in mosquito\n\n01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:08.100\ncoast that's your uh oprah oprah list the so so i just like i i definitely lost the power to\n\n01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:13.140\narticulate what i'm saying but like i it is interesting to be like hey man don't kill yourself\n\n01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:19.940\nbecause you never know it's also like it's more important like to me to be like yeah you never\n\n01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:25.300\nknow so don't kill yourself but i know that sounds like the same thing but like i i just like it's a\n\n01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:30.660\nfeeling it's a it's always a feeling that's the weird thing about humanity is there is no logical\n\n01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:39.860\nreason to stay alive there is only just just hanging out and it it it's that it's that belief that if\n\n01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:46.100\nsomething doesn't make sense it shouldn't exist that can be fatal for kids who who don't have an\n\n01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:53.780\nexperience yet with like oh shit sometimes shit just is super dark and confusing and then all of\n\n01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:59.380\na sudden it's not and they don't know that when they're 16 and then they do the they do things that\n\n01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:04.500\nany human can do they have the power to do things that you'd never do when you were 40 just because\n\n01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:11.220\nyou've experienced more 16s by then you've been like well yeah this too shall pass and and i and\n\n01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:15.220\nso there is this wisdom even though it sounds kind of provincial it sounds like your your old\n\n01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:22.660\ndaughtery guidance counselor but it's it's just like just don't act on anything that you're only\n\n01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:28.260\nfeeling it doesn't duck and feelings aren't valid is is that a common thing that you think about or\n\n01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:34.180\nis that something that just comes up once in a while the idea of like like offing yourself like\n\n01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:39.220\noh i i i used to get depressed i haven't gotten depressed in quite some time thank god but i used\n\n01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:43.780\nto get like severely depressed and part of that is like intrusive suicidal thoughts but he'll be\n\n01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:54.820\nthinking about it next wednesday night in a cage with uh elan musk for real like our our friends\n\n01:54:54.820 --> 01:55:00.980\nkeep killing themselves like our funny friends keep dying i'm not gonna kill myself don't please\n\n01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:05.460\nand no i'm not i'm this is what you think but that's actually a thought that you that like\n\n01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:11.700\nruns through your brain oh god i would i love i really love being alive and i wouldn't like i i\n\n01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:16.100\nused to have depression i don't now but i and i and it recurred through my i've thought about it too\n\n01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:20.660\ni think it's important for people to go like it's a thought how did you go from being uh thoughts of\n\n01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:26.260\ndepression and to not being depressed like what was the transition for you jesus it was a long\n\n01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:32.900\nfucking fiber journey it was my fiber journey you should read my book it's on amazon i've read\n\n01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:38.500\nyour fiber blog fiber cured my depression fiber enemas spencer you got thoughts it was quinoa it\n\n01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:45.620\nwas quinoa yeah it's a combo of quinoa and fiber and just like a basic like i i i rub fiber into\n\n01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:52.100\nmy prolapse in the morning and it just like makes me no no i i that was not that just so you know\n\n01:55:52.100 --> 01:55:56.340\nand thank you for asking that now is that not a cry for help it was and there's not a secret\n\n01:55:56.340 --> 01:56:02.180\nthing underneath it or like i i really like to be alive i i don't have any desire at all to no\n\n01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:06.180\nlonger exist i have this beautiful son and a wonderful wife i love to exist i i like it so\n\n01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:13.540\nmuch but i do think that depressed people uh they even that's this what is a psychologically\n\n01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:17.940\ndocumented thing which is intrusive suicidal thoughts become shameful you know you're like oh\n\n01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:23.140\nmy god my brain spit out this horrific way of doing things and then you feel embarrassed about it\n\n01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:27.540\nbecause you're like you don't want to talk about it and also you don't want to talk about it and then\n\n01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:31.860\nyou kill yourself but then you're like are my but you're thinking like shit man i must be so crazy\n\n01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:38.500\nthat i'd want to do that when and i really do mean this is not that i'm saying the instinct to kill\n\n01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:44.180\nyourself is actually more of an instinct to move beyond who you think you are you're just desperately\n\n01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:50.180\ntrying to solve the problem of this micro is hardcore compression into your identity and so\n\n01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:56.020\nuh this which is why i one of the things i've heard is before you reject yourself you need to\n\n01:56:56.020 --> 01:57:01.380\nknow yourself how can you reject yourself if you don't know who you are and so the idea is to first\n\n01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:07.780\nprior to any kind of horrific solution like that see if you can figure out what you actually are\n\n01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:12.580\nand in that exploration it's really cool because like literally everything in the material universe\n\n01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:19.140\nif you zoom in on it far enough it disappears similarly the identity itself if you spend any\n\n01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:25.620\ntime analyzing it and deeply looking into it you will begin to notice the most beautiful terrifying\n\n01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:32.260\nand ultimately liberating thing happens which is you as you thought you were ceased to exist\n\n01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:36.980\nand you didn't have to jump out of a building for that to happen and somewhere in there i think is\n\n01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:44.420\nsomething quite beautiful and uh a far less destructive solution for your community and\n\n01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:49.220\nand i think there's some compassion there too there's something really sweet about being in all\n\n01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:53.300\nthat fucking pain that you get into when you're depressed beyond pain you wish you were in pain\n\n01:57:53.300 --> 01:58:02.020\nyou wish you were sad anything to not just feel that numb dead entropic miasmic paralysis you\n\n01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:07.220\nwould give anything just to feel a moment of sadness and somewhere in that there is something so\n\n01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:12.340\nsweet and beautiful about still finding the strength to stay alive because you know the\n\n01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:18.180\npeople around you would be so devastated to me that is a really beautiful thing and that is a\n\n01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:22.900\nreason to stay alive and a logical reason to stay alive aside from the fact that when you kill\n\n01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:28.740\nyourself a hundred percent of the time you wake up and you're having a deja vu as a metro city bus\n\n01:58:28.740 -->
