Comptroller Jeff Davis, everybody.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:43.000\nI think they missed you from informal polls on Twitter.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:47.000\nI wouldn't go on Reddit. I don't want to go on there.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:50.000\nThere's too much objective clinical...\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:52.000\nI don't think Reddit wants you on Reddit.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:56.000\nIf you're being talked about on Reddit, like, Reddit doesn't want\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:58.000\nthe town of Ferguson to be on Reddit.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:00.000\nIt wants to talk about...\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:03.000\nBecause if it would get out, it would go,\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:05.000\nhey, we're a real town.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:09.000\nBut just from Twitter, every time I would go,\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:11.000\nlike, hey, we're doing the show tonight,\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:14.000\nthere's always a minimum of three or four obnoxious,\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:16.000\nlike, and Jeff?\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:18.000\nSo it's good you're back.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.000\nThank you, Dan. It's good to be here.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:27.000\nThank you, Dan.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:29.000\nOh, and I missed you as well. I'm glad you're back.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:31.000\nI missed you.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nAnd I was doing what they call playing hard to get.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:36.000\nIt's good. It makes a relationship stronger.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:40.000\nIn that men are from Mars, women are from Venus' book.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:42.000\nI remember the guy describing, said,\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:44.000\nwomen are waves.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nThis is no longer politically correct to say.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:48.000\nWomen are anything.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:52.000\nYou could say women are porpoises.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:54.000\nIt sounds bad now.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:56.000\nBut women are waves.\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:58.000\nThey go up and down, and men are rubber bands.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nThey go back and forth.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:02.000\nThey pull away, and if you let them pull away,\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.000\nthey snap back.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:08.000\nSounds like a big justification for a lot of hoohah\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:10.000\nwritten by a dude.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:12.000\nBut I don't know.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:14.000\nI feel it. I feel it myself stretching back\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nand snapping back sometimes.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:23.000\nAlso, police brutality is like a rubber band.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:27.000\nIf you let it go, it stretches and stretches.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:29.000\nAlso, if you put it on too tight,\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\nit constricts you and you die.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nYeah.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:39.000\nWell, I mean, it's not the goal to be sensitive\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:41.000\nin these times around this subject.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:43.000\nI do want to be a curmudgeon.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:45.000\nLet's do the cane-shaking segment.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:47.000\nCane-shaking segment.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:50.000\nI want to do more segments now that we're on video.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:53.000\nCane-shaking segment.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:56.000\nHe's got a cane and he wants to shake it.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:00.000\nHe's mad because you are young and he's old\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:04.000\nand he wants you off the world's lawn.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nKnock it off.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:09.000\nStop being so young all the time.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:12.000\nI can't walk, so I'm shaking this thing.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:15.000\nAnd I used to help me walk.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:20.000\nDan?\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:23.000\nIt's good to be back.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:28.000\nSo, I was listening to a police advocacy lawyer\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:33.000\nwhich is a great gig these days.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:36.000\nThe hourlies are like...\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:39.000\nThe police advocacy lawyer at NPR,\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.000\nand they were talking about the Garner autopsy\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:47.000\nand how the pathologist ruled it a homicide.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nAnd the lawyer's response was,\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:54.000\nwell, homicide just means that one person's life\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nwas ended by another person.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:00.000\nIt doesn't mean a crime was committed.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nAnd he's right, I guess.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nBut it really leapt out at me,\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nand this is called the cane-shaking segment\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:08.000\nso you can't get mad at me for connecting these dots.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:10.000\nI just, like, I wanted to roll down the window\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:13.000\nand shout at the...\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nIt gets you.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nThis is where refinement of language will...\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nThese are your bedfellows.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.000\nThese are the people who speak perfectly.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nThese are the people who are very polite.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nThey always mean exactly what they're saying,\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nor rather, they never do.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nBut they never say the wrong thing.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nThey never use the wrong words.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nAnd they're advocates of murderers.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:36.000\nBut it's not murder, it's homicide.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:39.000\nSo get your shit together and get off my lawn.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:46.000\nIt's kind of a rare, so weird moment in the news right now,\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nlike a strange harmonic convergence\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:52.000\nwhere it kind of actually feels like the things\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nthat are in the news right now\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:59.000\nare the things that news is usually distracting us from.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:02.000\nThe death of journalism is in the news right now,\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:05.000\nwhich is the most important thing to be in the news\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nsince the death of journalism.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:11.000\nThe Rolling Stone thing is a hot button.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:15.000\nI won't touch it, but it has brought the concept\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:18.000\nof journalism dying and what responsibilities are\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nand how journalism actually works\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:23.000\nto a generation that seems to maybe justifiably\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nbecause of the new media overwhelming them\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nwith an increased news cycle.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nThere's a lot of old disciplines\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nthat have been forgotten, confirmation of sources and things.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nThere's still a good journalist out there,\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:41.000\nbut let's face it, the worlds that we used to call tabloid\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nand all these things.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nWe used to have different compartments for these things,\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nand since the 20s, they've all been kind of merging.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nI mean, it's a gradual, slow thing,\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nbut spiked with the internet.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nWhat the hell is the difference between real news?\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\nIt's not, just like real news sites.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nThey still have the same fucking weird clickbait stuff.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nYou can't tell the difference.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:04.000\nBut now that cops are choking people to death\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:08.000\nand there's cameras everywhere, I don't know.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nYou think maybe there would be like a little golden age\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:13.000\nresurgence of journalistic integrity?\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:18.000\nMaybe. I mean, there's crazy shit happening.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:22.000\nIt's becoming very clear that being a team player\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:26.000\nisn't necessarily the secret to world peace.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nIt's been kind of a leitmotif\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nin the last 20 years or so.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nWhat would you call the golden age looking back of journalism?\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:34.000\nWhen did you think?\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:38.000\nOh, definitely, 1985. I mean...\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:39.000\nWas there ever a time?\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:43.000\nI read you the following review of Back to the Future.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:46.000\nSintillating with his beautiful locks of gossamer hair.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nI don't know.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nI told you when I walked out of Back to the Future,\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nEyes of New York as a kid in 1985.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nWas that when it was? Yeah.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:55.000\nAnd I came out of the theater.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:59.000\nIt was a mnemonic device. The whole movie's about 1985.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:00.000\nI told you this, right?\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:01.000\nI walked out of the theater\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nand everybody poured out of this Lowe's Theater in New York\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\non the west side and everybody was beaming.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:07.000\nEverybody was so happy.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nWe almost kind of walked out holding hands.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nLike it was the most together you ever saw in New Yorkers\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nin my life.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nAnd they walked out and some guy was like...\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:17.000\nHe was kind of like...\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nI would put him probably at 35.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nI was like 11 at the time or 10, 11.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nAnd this guy just kind of shook his head,\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nlike kind of happily goes,\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nSpielberg did it again!\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nI did it.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nAnd we all kind of paused.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nHe kind of ruined the moment, but we all were like,\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nyeah, he fucking did it.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nHe presented it again.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nThat screenplay took seven years to write, by the way.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nGet off my lawn.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nIt took seven years to write.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nYou can't just shit these things out.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nWhy is your screenplay coming out then?\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nIt's seven years and it'll be good.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nAnd men stretch back.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nYou gotta let them stretch back.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nIt's just a pulpit for my agenda.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nPeople shouldn't have to get milk.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nIt's bad for you.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nSomeone asked me to get milk.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nI heard someone say what, the gas, what?\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nIt's just explaining.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nAll right.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nI don't want to do a\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nhomicidal cop spree segment.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nYeah, I do.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nOkay, let's do it.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nDo you want new music for that?\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nYeah.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nOkay, let's do...\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nLet's find something good here.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nLet's do...\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nWell, your job\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nain't just to kill\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\npeople\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nbefore they commit\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\na crime.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nSometimes you...\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nOh, who's this guy?\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nShoot him!\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nHe had a gun!\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nHe came in on the first verse,\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nand he was reaching into his waistband.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nHe was just singing about a woman.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nI saw him reaching.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nYou shot him there.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nHe had a big red gun.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nNo, that was a guitar pick.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nDan, that was a guitar pick.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nNo.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nThis is local.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nHollywood and Highland.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nTwo cops shot a guy.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nI know nothing about this.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nI'm going to put a kind of laughably\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nafterthought thing,\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nlike, I do know that\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\ncops must have it\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nreally bad right now, all over the place.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nMany of whom do not deserve it.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nIt's in the zeitgeist right now\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nthat cops are terrible people and blah, blah, blah.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nThere are people who still have to get up in the morning\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nand put on a badge and go to work.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nThere was a crazy guy outside my front gate today,\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nand I immediately remembered,\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nholy shit, I need the fucking place!\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nThere's a million good ones\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nand I've met\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\ngood people that also\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nhappen to go to work and risk their lives to be a cop.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nIt doesn't seem like the time or the place\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nfor that disclaimer, but it also feels like\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nI'm compelled to create that balance\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nbecause it's easy to fan the flames right now.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nAnyways, I know nothing about\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nhow the LAPD is doing.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nSince Rodney King, the Department of Justice\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\ntook over the LAPD, they restructured it.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nI don't know where we're at with that.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nSomeone in the audience might know more about it.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nAnd I don't know what the crime rate,\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nhow it was impacted.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nI don't know how much of that is phony.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nWe're all praying when we heard the cops\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nshot a guy\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nin L.A. in the midst of all this.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nDidn't everyone...\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nOne of the writers at\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nCommunity voiced this and said\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nconfessingly,\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nconfessionally,\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nI've never found myself just saying,\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nplease, God let them have killed a white man.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nThe city just doesn't need it.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nThe rain is fucking with our infrastructure.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nIt's hard to drive right now.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nThere's all that oil after a drought,\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nand the cars are sliding.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nDon't kill any black people.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nWe just don't need it to happen.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nIt looked from the photos\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nlike a white enough guy.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nWe're all fine.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nNot that I see race.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nThere's a split street. You don't see race, Dan?\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nNo, I don't. Who's that?\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nWhat's that guy?\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nHe's got a red hat. That's what he is.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nIt's Anatoly. We know him.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nWho's that guy? He's exotic.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nThat's it.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nStand up.

Highland.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nSomebody just brought through the photo\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nup in the writer's room today.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nThis is all I've seen.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nI'm not a journalist.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nPlease forgive me for whatever.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nYou talk about it online.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nThey brought up a photo.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nIt was a split screen.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nOn the left side is a photo that was taken\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nby just a bystander\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nwho was there at the moment\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nwhen this guy got shot.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nThere's a guy that's down\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nin the crosswalk.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nHis face is facing the camera.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nIt's Hollywood and Highland\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nand the two cops braced\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nand obviously scared\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nand they did this thing.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nOn the right side is\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nthe crime scene photograph.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nAfter everything's been catalogued\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nand the guy's sitting there, it's the same scene\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nbut there's little evidence\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nlike markers everywhere.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nAnd one of the more prominent ones\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nis this evidence marker of this knife that the guy had\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nwhich is not in the left photo.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nIt doesn't seem to be in the left photo.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nIt seems like the left photo\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nis just a dead guy in a crosswalk\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nand then the right photo\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nthere's this knife that's there.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nThat's what it seems like.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nI don't want to amplify\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nthings that are already\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nnot true but I'm reporting\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\non the gossip.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nI was in Europe and I didn't see any news\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nso I'm completely unaware of all of this.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nI've now dumped\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\neverything that I heard today.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nSomebody just threw up the photo.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nSo Hollywood and Highland?\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nBoth.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nOn that very corner, you mean?\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nIsn't that where Hollywood High School is?\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nNo.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nThat's Sunset, right?\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nA friend of mine\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nChris Dermick\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nI met him.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nHe was driving down Hollywood\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\non Highland\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nand passed Hollywood down to Sunset where Hollywood High is\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nand he came to a stop at the intersection there\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nand he was two or three cars\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nbehind the red light waiting there\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nand kids were getting out of school\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nand the car in front of him\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\na dude got out of a car.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nA young Latino kid got out, took a gun\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nand walked up to a kid standing there and went bang bang\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nshot him twice in the chest, got back in the car\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nand waited for the light to turn green.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nSounds like a time life book\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nOld West or something.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nNo one did anything\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nbecause everyone just waited for the light to turn green\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nand they drove off\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nand didn't just drive off\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\npolitely waited for the light to turn green\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nand drive safely away from the murder scene.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nRight.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nSo that is the world\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nin which police work\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nand that's what gets brought up in the comment sections on the other side\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nwhen we're all going like this is crazy\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nwe're losing our minds\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nwhat is going on.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nIt's saying like\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nit's a jungle out there and it's crazy\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nand it's you know like they're risking their lives\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nand nobody is wrong about any of this stuff\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nbut I think the only\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nthe person I'm going to go with\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nand I'm putting a ribbon on this so I can move forward\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nbecause I don't want to just like jump into this and go\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nlike run out\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nI just want to put a little ribbon on it\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nmy\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nthe way I'm looking at it right now\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nbecause what we learned from the Garner thing\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nis that this whole like God bless their\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nwalking patient heroic souls\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nthat Michael Brown family\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nyou read their statement about\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nwhen the verdict came out\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nand they just you know they've\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nit was just like\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nI don't understand a human being that could respond that way\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nin this situation\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nbut they were heavily emphasizing like the need\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nfor cameras\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\ncameras cameras cameras on these\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\ncops it's a hard job\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\ncrazy shit happens for everyone's good\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nwe're living a surveillance state anyway\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\naren't there just cameras all over these people\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nthat are out there risking\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\ntheir lives and protecting us\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nso that we don't have to have these fucking crazy arguments\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nbut\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nthe Garner thing is\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\non camera and it's like\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nyou watch a guy get killed and it doesn't\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nreally matter that much\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nso the what is\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nthe important thing what is our take away\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nthe why am I do why am I\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nwhat like no other podcast can talk about this\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nwhat is my role in this world\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nwhat the fuck\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\ntalk about community in a second\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nwhat is your role\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nwhy is it on your mind\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nit's just it's on everyone's mind\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nso I'm just talking about what's on everyone's mind\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nI sound like I'm speaking with authority\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nbecause I'm speaking into a microphone and no one else is responding\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nI am just a washer in the sea of this\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nso it just sounds like I'm pontificating\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nI am pontificating but I'm not\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nlike I'm not drawing\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\non any kind of like decisions that I've made\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nmy current take away is just like\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nwhat this young lady said on an NPR\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nwas like I think we really need to seriously\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nexamine the way that we\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nlook at the role of police\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nand the law\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nwe have this\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nphilosophy evolving where we think\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nthat the first and most important thing is\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\ncompliance and that if we\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\nhave that then laws won't be broken\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nbecause everyone will be afraid of the police\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nand I think we're seeing about\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nprobably 60 years of that coming to\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nthe fruits of that are now\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nlike just rotting\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nand falling into the street\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nand it's on the inner tubes now because everyone's got these\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nlittle dangly doodles\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nand so we're seeing\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nnow it's just like you know it's weird\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nit's weird to have six people respond to\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nan untaxed cigarette sale\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nit's give them a ticket\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nand like it wouldn't nothing would have happened\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nlike just give somebody a ticket\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nfor things that have to do with finance\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nand let money do its beautiful beautiful work\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nand when\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\npeople are being physically assaulted\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nlike then that's where the guns and the\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nchokings and the numchucks and stuff should come out\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nbut I have no answers\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nbut I have questions\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nand where our questions should have to do with first of all\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nhow many people get killed every year by cops\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nwe don't have those statistics and why does this happen\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nand if we're going to be a federal nation\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nmaybe we should put the pedal to the metal\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nand just fucking federalize and be fucking federal about everything\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nI never thought I'd say that but Jesus Christ\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nwell\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nget off your lawn indeed\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nI want federal government\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nknock it off your states\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nI'm a bull mooser\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nI don't think I had anything

married\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nI think that you know the important thing about marriage is\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nand I was actually talking to an ex-girlfriend\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nabout this who's recently married and is now\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\npregnant\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nso we were having a little like\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\nday new

21:07.000\nwhen you sit down and for me it was like I was writing\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nmy vows and I was like you know this is\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nan hour and a half of doing something

location\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nand I was like asking Aaron like\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nhow's he dressed, what does he look like\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nand I drew the conclusion I was like\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nthat guy is like a relative of one of our neighbors\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nhe hasn't been around in a while\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nhe has half a support system\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nletting him out\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nand he's like haunting these spots\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nand he's a little confused and maybe\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nyou know on the wrong meds\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nor off the half of them or having to\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\ndrink with them or something's happening and he's kind of like\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nhe's gravitating this spot\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nI was fucking dead on because there was a guy\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\na party guest came by I was like knew who the guy was\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nknew who he was related to in the neighborhood\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nand said I'm gonna call his mom and she doesn't know\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nI was fucking nailed it\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nI'm like Dr. Quinn\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nmedicine woman\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nmedicine woman\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nshe's more intuitive than a regular doctor\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nDan doing a camera take doesn't save that bit\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nyou guys just appeal to fake people out there\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nalright alright so no more\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nI got no more ever notes\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\nbut the show's only just begun\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nI have a special\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\na special friend here\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nhe's come to LA and he's\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nbopping around doing special projects\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nand I\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nsaw on Twitter that he was in LA and I've been\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\ntweeting back and forth over a long time\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nhe made one of the best shows in\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nthe UK\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nin the world\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nhe's no fluke he's a repeated\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nBritish TV\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nwith multiple successes one of which\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nyou're a huge fan of\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nif you're willing to come up here and have a little\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nchit chat please come up\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\ncreator of father Ted and the IT crowd\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nGraham Linnahan\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nI\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nthink that the IT crowd\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\ntranscends even the Anglophile\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nfactor like I would assume\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\neverybody in this audience like probably\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nis like the first to\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nlove like British shit more than American\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nshit it's a sort of\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nI'm just trying to copy American shit\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nyeah I want to talk about that\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nin one second\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nbut the IT crowd I think kind of\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nstands out as this real like\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nexport like I think people that\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\nwhich probably explains the continued attempts\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nto Americanize it\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nwhich I also want to talk in depth about\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nwhy I'm here as well\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nI'm trying to help one of those attempts\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nand the first attempt was a little bit of a\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nfalse start they boxed you out\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nI found out about it on the internet\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\none day I saw oh the\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\npilot of the IT crowd\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nstarts filming in a week or something\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nand yeah they just didn't tell\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nme about it they didn't tell me\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nI didn't get a single phone call\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nor anything in fact I think you know\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nthe people who did it\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nSony? No\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nI think they wrote briefly on a little\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nshow called community\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nare you talking about\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:39.000\nI know you're working with some of them now\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nno no no that's\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\ntotally different group the first time\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nwas these guys you took over\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nwhen you stopped doing it for a while\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nwas that Porton Grasio? Yeah\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nthey tried to do the first\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nI didn't make that connection\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nI didn't know that\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\nI try not to think about the whole\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nthing so\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nI hope I'm not incredibly wrong here\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nbut yeah I think it's the same guys\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nPorton Grasio are doing what?\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nThey did the\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nPorton Grasio did what? I think\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nif I know we were going to talk about this\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nI would have looked it up again\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nbut they did the original version\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nof the IT crowd with Joel\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:19.000\nwhich is online\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nand you can watch if you are hating yourself\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nparticularly\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nthere's a\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\ncrazy weird\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nvelcro level\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\na coincidence factor\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nin the relationship between\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nIT crowd and community\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nI don't know how much of it is causal\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nand how much of it is completely independent of each other\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nJoel McHale was on that attempt\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nto do the IT crowd\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nif you're correct Porton Grasio\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nwho would later supplant me\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nwe're running it\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nRichard Iowani ended up directing a community episode\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nthat's less coincidence and we're just\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nmoving a fan of the IT crowd\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nbut before Joel McHale\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nwas cast or even considered\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\npart of Jeff Winger on community\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nguess who I had dinner with\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nbecause people were jazzed about him\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nand they really wanted to meet this\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nhot actor\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nChris O'Dowd was going to meet Jeff Winger\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\npossibly I did a little dinner with him\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nbut Joel McHale wasn't even on the table yet\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nthat's so weird\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:19.000\nthat's incredible\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nthat's the one that really weirded me out\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.000\nit might be because we're interested in similar things\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nand themes\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nI always thought community was the closest thing\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nto an IT crowd\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nbecause I don't think you can do\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nmy kind of comedy\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nin front of a studio audience over here\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nquite as easily\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.000\nthe one we're doing here is going to be in front of a studio audience\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nbut\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nI want to try and help make it\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nwork more as a US sitcom\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nit's going to be a multi-cam this new year\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nI think that's appropriate\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nthe multi-cam is not\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nby definition stupid\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nand one need only watch a British\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nor an old American show\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nor Seinfeld\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nSeinfeld is not that old\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nthat's the last big sitcom\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nisn't it\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nfriends\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\ndid Seinfeld run after it\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nI can't remember\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nthese aren't that old\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nthings like faulty towers\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nI just hate the idea of chucking\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nall these things in the bin\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nbecause they're supposedly out of date\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nit's because they satisfied\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\npeople so much that form\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nthat it became automatable\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nand so the craft got a little corrupted\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nby the money\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nand so it's the practices that are associated\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nwith the format\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nit's not like people can look at\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nthe shows that break big\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nbecause they really become culturally effective\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nand make people really happy\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nthey're multi-cam shows\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nand unless you start counting mash\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nor you know let's say Beverly Hillbillies\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nthere's that\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nit doesn't have that same chance\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nof really becoming\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\na culturally effective\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\ncornerstone\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nI do think it's a little bit of magic dust\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\nsometimes when you hear an audience laughing\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nbut the important thing is\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nwhen you hear a real audience laughing\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nwhen you hear them really laughing\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nand I think that you have to just\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nyou bring them into a studio\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nI almost think I'll ask you if it's true\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nI think in the UK\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nbecause there's a lot less\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nlike super\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\ncapitalistic\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nengine running the whole thing\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nthe little less like fever pitch\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:29.000\nlike juice that baby up a little bit\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nwho's that guy in the front\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nhey you know who we're bringing in? The Hammer Laffer\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nhis name's Todd Hammer\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\nhe laughs at $75 an hour\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nhe's a great laffer\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nI think you might have a bit more technology\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nas well around it\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nthe only manipulation I do\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nis when I overrule the audience\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nbecause they often laugh at things\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nthat weren't meant to be funny\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nor that aren't really funny\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nand I just kind of go no\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nyou're overruled because the thing\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.000\nthat really makes people think it's fake\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nis when someone laughs at something that's not funny\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nwas Father Ted multi camp\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nor was it all single? Yeah multi camp\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nbut you did exterior stuff too\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nyeah and we played the audience\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\non monitors\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nespecially since the internet\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nespecially since I can actually talk to people\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nI'm really really serious\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nabout making sure that every laugh is\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nyou know real and often\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nif you're you know what people don't realize\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nis you're often going between three or four takes\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nand so the audience laughed\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nand then if we weren't to do anything\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nto the laughter the audience would just go\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nand then it would just cut off\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nand then it would be a kind of little giggle\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nand you just kind of make it\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nthe audience is like an actor\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\nyou're pretending the audience suddenly has to\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nyou have to suddenly pretend that they're\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nan audience watching a whole performance\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nall the way through I think it's a great energy\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nto multi camp stuff like for the actors\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nit's like putting on a play you rehearse all week\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nand there's laughs that get laughs all week\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nand some that go away and some that change\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nand sometimes on the night the laugh that you\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nwas in the bank the whole time\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\njust doesn't work in front of the audience\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nand so there's an energy to the cast\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nwhere you're always alive and the writers are there\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\npitching lines and there is\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\na kind of an energy to a multi camp\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nI love it you know I love when\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nit doesn't get a laugh and running out\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nand having a quick kind of intense\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nconflab to try and come up with a better line\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nand sometimes it can be a pitch of a new line\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nor just an adjustment of the performance\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\nand that's magical sometimes\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nyeah it really is and it's\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nyou know it's why I like\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nto do it I don't do I've done a show recently\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nthough called The Walshers\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nwhich is a single camera\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nand they're naturalistic actors\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nit requires\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nthe camera to be up close\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nup the tiny little flickers\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nan audience would only get in the way of that\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nyou know but there's some performers\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nwho they're kind of lifted\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\non gales of laughter you know\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\na guy I work with Steve Delaney\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nwho does a character called Count Arthur\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nthat I'm writing at the moment\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nyou know John Cleese\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nin Faulty Towers you know he's just\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nyou can't imagine some of these shows without\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nlike Kramer you know Michael Richards\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nin Seinfeld you know\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nwithout laughter he would just be\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nkind of weird\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nbut also it's also\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nholding for real laughter when you come in\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nand something magical happens and there's a laughter\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nyou actually like Carol Burnett's show\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nwhere they would hold for these giant laughter\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\noh yeah that's great too\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nand then like you as a viewer\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nwatching through your TV I was a kid watching\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nlike Carol Burnett and my carpet in front of my big Xenus TV\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nit's like you felt like you were part of that audience\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nyou were part of the tribe\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nbut when you're watching that I just don't think\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nI think it's just at the moment\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nthere don't seem to be many good shows\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:39.000\nthat have an audience you know but it'll change\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nit'll be one big show\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nit'll be great everyone will love it\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nand suddenly everyone will be like\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nwhy are you doing single camera stuff\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nit'll be the IT crowd because I'm sure you're at a great network\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nthat respects comedy\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nwhere is it\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nNBC\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nalright\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nthis one's gonna last forever\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nI can't have this conversation\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\ninto

I yeah I defer\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nconstant I love like\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nthe my favorite thing is if I\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\ncan if I can write a story if I can come up with\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nsomething and then I can I can actually\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\ngo through the script and then\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nI finally learned this after like four years\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:35.000\nof doing a TV show like\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:37.000\nhow to that you're supposed to just\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\ndo this that like write a shitty script\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.000\nbut have it make some semblance\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:43.000\nof sense and like then go\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nthrough and then you put like\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nI put three question marks\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nI don't know who taught me that I don't know if that comes from\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.000\none show or another that's a standard thing\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:53.000\nbut three question marks and then\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nlike Chang comes in and says\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nthey go where were you it goes like\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nI'm an hour late because\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nquestion mark question mark question mark\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.000\nI I fought\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\na German shepherd over\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\na butterscotch candy and I lost\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nand it's not funny and it doesn't matter\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nand then I just ship it out to a room\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:13.000\nfull of geniuses\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\nwho work for Colbert and\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.000\nthe onion and the lampoon and everything\n\n53:17.000 -->

fifth season\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nand I just got really tired\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.000\nand I thought no this is done\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:27.000\nbut I had enough ideas\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nleft to make the special\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nbecause I really wanted to do\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nDouglas doing secret millionaire\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nand I had one or

57:43.000\nand then when you moved on\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:45.000\nto something else did you find a rejuvenating energy?\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:47.000\nyeah absolutely\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nI'll write community forever\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:53.000\nbut it's just like\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:55.000\nman it is like\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nlike flint against\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nsteel\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\nit's just a machine\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nit's just a machine over here\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:05.000\njust the desire for more\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nthe Simpsons blows me away\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nyou know all due respect\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nI hear it's gotten really good again\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.000\nor like one season ago\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nit was really good\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nbut you know\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nit's just crazy how long it goes on\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nSouth Park too it's like endless\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.000\nI can't imagine how the\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:25.000\nhow the Simpsons is able to\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nlike\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nit's\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nI just don't understand how they can sit there and go like\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nwhat if Bart\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nwhat?\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nwasn't there a thing\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nSam Simon telling me this\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nthey would have like two\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nthey would write two different bowls\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nof paper like there was\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\na line of A stories and B stories\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.000\nlike a garage sale and then someone goes\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:51.000\nto the moon and they just picked two at random\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nI don't know if that's true\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nthat was great do you know what I used to love about the Simpsons\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nthe way you can look at an episode\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nof Simpsons like in the\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\ngolden age\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.000\nand the opening\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:05.000\n60 seconds will happen and you'll have no idea\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nwhat the rest of the episode is\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nthat was delightful\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nI was very inspired by that\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:13.000\nI don't do that on community or anything\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nbut I think that's so fucking cool\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nbecause you cannot\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nyou're like oh this episode begins with\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nlike hey Mars where's the little\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nwatermelon let's go we gotta go get more watermelon\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.000\nand then for seven minutes into it\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:27.000\nyou're like oh this is the outer space one\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:29.000\nit's incredible\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nit's so weird\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:33.000\nbut the thing about it is\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:35.000\nI think the biggest problem\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nwith it is because they're the same age\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nthere's only so many\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\ntimes they can do certain emotional\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nstorylines like I used\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nto love when the Simpsons got sad\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:47.000\nlike you remember when\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nHomer met his mother\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nand a shot of him\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\njust watching the highway\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nmy favorite is when\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nDustin Hoffman is the substitute teacher\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:59.000\noh yeah\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nyou are Lisa Simpson\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nthere was a change on that\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nI spoke to him on twitter about that\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nhe said he still loses sleep\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nbecause the line you are

01:07:45.000\nesophagus mold\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nand then the raptors like\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nand they do what they're told\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nbut they're kind of like there's a begrudging respect\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nhe's like he's like\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nhe's like hold you get them to do what you want\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nlike that and he's like\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nI didn't get him to do what I want\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nI let him do what they want\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nand he's hit that Chris Pratt\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nhas hit that sweet spot where it's like\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nhe's all the women want to\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nwant him to make out with them and all the men don't mind\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nand that's the key\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nyou don't want to get into that\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nTom Cruise gutter where it's like\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nall the men are like yeah I can\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nare there any kind of comic

badass\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nand you want Chris Pratt to be like the voice of them\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nyou gotta let them be cool\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nthey're clever girls\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nbut he'll be cool\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nin American movies\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000\ngoing from TV to movies\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nthere's some rule\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nyou get two movies\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nyou can do a shitty movie and then a good one\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nthere's math you can break down\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nSeinfeld couldn't survive it\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nthe math is unforgivable\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000\ngoing from TV to movies\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000\nbut if you go from TV to movies\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nyou can hit these thermal events\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nof success and then you have a 25-year career\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nMatthew McConaughey\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nhe went away and now he's writing high\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nin a thermal right now\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nhe's speaking strictly about TV\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nactor\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nmaking that jump\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nwe kind of haze people\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nI don't want to watch Andy Murphy in a movie\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nbut anyways\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nhow about those cops huh\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nI see your retweets\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nyou're kind of a dissident\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nyou're on the side of the anarchist\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nyeah\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nI'm on the side of people who don't kill people\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nfor no reason\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nit's a bold stance, Graham\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nfor an Irishman\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\njust for Irishness\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nbut no, I just think\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nI try and retweet things\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nthat aren't going to inflame things\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nI try and be careful\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nafter a few early mistakes\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000\non Twitter\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nI'm very careful before I\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000\ntweet something that looks like it's going to\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000\njust kind of burst into flames\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nyou know what I mean\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000\ndo you address\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nbecause I know you don't\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nsorry to interrupt but\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nwhat you were saying earlier\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nno, fuck you\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nto me it's the most fascinating thing\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000\nbecause it's the camera thing\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nit's the fact that we all have cameras\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nand it's all this stuff\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nhas just been going on forever\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nand you can just see it\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nand it's like a light's been switched on\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nand everyone's going oh look at all this shit in here\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nyou know\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nand that's what I just find fascinating about it\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nand I think that I like to try and\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nmake the light reach further\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nand I got a big following\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nfor me a big following\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nso I get to\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nspread it out a bit\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nthis is an interesting analogy\n\n01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000\npeople tend to think of it in terms of bandwidth\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nor like extra channels and things\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nin terms of like we've been groping around in the dark\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000\nin candlelight or something\n\n01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000\nand then they have the lights go\n\n01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nand there's this sort of like\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\noh my god\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nthat person looks\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000\ncompletely different than I thought they did\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nthere's more people over here\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nthey weren't even making any sound\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nnow I can see them\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nand there's some people that are reacting to that\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nthere's part of the human it's like\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nyou scream in terror and you start doing crazy shit\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nand then there's other people who are like\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nyou can scientifically find out more\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nnow\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nbut the problem for the place\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nI think is that I would imagine\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nthere's a few systems that they have in place\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nyou know\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nif you shoot a guy and just\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000\ndrop a knife near the thing\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nbut that doesn't work anymore\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nbecause now there's two shots\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nand I don't think that\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nI think that they're just gonna have to\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nadjust\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nit'll be interesting to see how that plays out though\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nwe have this like overwhelming tendency to side\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nwith the system that keeps us safe at night\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nand it does keep us safe at night\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nand it's like one of the most disturbing things\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nthat we're seeing is\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nthe revelation of\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nI think as Jeff has always said we're a right of center country\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nwe can say\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nwe can talk all we want about it\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nwe have a bipartisan system and blah blah blah\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nwe are in an empirically\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nideological spectrum we are right of center\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nwe are a fucking empire\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nwe'd have to be right of center\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nwe can't be centrist and control the planet\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nwe have to\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nhave like a conservative slant\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000\non things we like the way things\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nwere yesterday a little bit more than we like\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nthings are gonna be tomorrow\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nyeah we didn't have to think about any of this stuff in the past\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nyou know cops are great\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\ncriminals were bad and even if we don't like cops\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\neven if we\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nyou know like have no reason to love them\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nand it's not gonna line our pocketbooks or anything\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nthere is a muscle that flexes\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nwhen somebody\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nsays in an article\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nyou know this guy forget about\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\ncops let's\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nbroaden this out into\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nI don't want to fan flames with my language\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000\ncan we just speak and stuff\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nthe rape culture\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nconsciousness there's this whole thing everything that we're talking about right now\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nthere's a phenomenon that happens\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nI think when you read a piece\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nwhen somebody is activated\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nsomebody is being an activist and they're writing an editorial piece\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nthere's a muscle\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nthat I feel that reacts\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nlike before I even know what I'm doing\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nI want to compensate\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nbecause I don't want to all at once\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000\njust be told that everything\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nis darkness and blood\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nand terror\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nand wrong and\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nwhat I thought was black is white\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nbut I think the way you can\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nyou know\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nlive in the modern world and\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nbe okay about it is you gotta think to

do you\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nare you ever\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nsupposed to say\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nit's a dumb question\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nbecause it's a case by case\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nbasis I think there's some people\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000\non Twitter that we want\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nI don't want to hear what Angie Harmon has to say\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nI don't want to hear what Dan Harmon\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nhas to say probably\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nthere might be other people that are like\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nfuck yeah I want to hear what Pat Oswald has to say\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nbut it's the other\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\npeople I'm more interested in\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nthe people who are like near\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000\nthe scene and take a picture\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nthere the people\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nthat's one of the reasons I love\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nTwitter it's brilliant being in touch\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nwith people like you and\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nother people I admire but\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nit's also great to\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nwhen something happens to drill down\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nand find the first person who saw it\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nthat's the thing when you talk about the light\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000\ncoming on and seeing all the cockroaches\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nthat we didn't know that were there in the kitchen floor\n\n01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nnow the implied fear\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nfor me is that the light can go out\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nand when that light goes out\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nwe're going to be fucking horrified\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nthat's why I think everyone should be\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000\na member of the EFF\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nover here the open rights group in the states\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nthe thing\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nyou should fight more than anything else\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nis your internet rights\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nbecause we suddenly have this ability\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nto see\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nand to talk to each other\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nand it's being chipped away\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nall the time just little things\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nlike net neutrality and all that sort of stuff\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nthey're constantly trying\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nto stop us from talking to each other\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nbut we've suddenly\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000\ngot a bit more power now we shouldn't give it up easily\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nwe're going to look back on these days\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nand be like holy shit you could\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\ncan you imagine\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nI mean I think there's a lot of bad things about it\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nI feel sometimes that I don't know\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nas many physical friends\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nin meat space as they say\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nas I used to\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nand the people I know on Twitter and so on\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nI know them in a very kind of light way\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nI mean you can literally just make them go away\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nif you want to\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nI think all that's a bit sad\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nbut at the same time I think\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nthere was some way in which we were all a bit lonely\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nbefore this\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nand suddenly we can all talk to each other\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nI think that's incredible\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nand when people used to kind of come down hard\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000\non Twitter and Facebook they used to get really annoyed\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nlike the social network\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nfilm just really annoys me\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nbecause Sorkin there is just basically\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nlike you little nerds\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nhe said in an interview\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nthey said to him are you on Facebook\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nand he says no\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nisn't this fine having a conversation\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nisn't that everyone gets interviewed\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nby journalists\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nand you see it as well\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000\ncomedians making fun of it\n\n01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nnot everyone's got a microphone\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nin their hands\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nand it's this kind of jealousy\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nof wanting to preserve the stage\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nto yourself because you're a writer\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nit used to be that when Aaron Sorkin\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nopened his mouth everybody would listen\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nand no one would be able to talk back to him\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nhe hates that people can talk back to him\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nis that\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nthe part of me that overlaps\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nwith Aaron Sorkin thinks that probably\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nanother thing he hates because before he hated it\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nhe had some dalliances\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nhe had a couple\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nlike I did when I got\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nrehired for the fifth season of Community\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nI was on a high and I wanted to have a conversation\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nwith people\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nI felt good about myself again and within\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nthree conversation threads\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nI created four TMZ headlines\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nand then I\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nrecoiled and I was like well Reddit is\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nI could easily said well Reddit is stupid\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nwhat I instead\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nsaid I probably say that all the time\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nbut what the\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nreality is\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nReddit is not for me\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nright now until I am back to being\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\na\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nconversant on equal ground\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nthere's weird things out there\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nthe whole hashtag outrage thing\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nis so annoying and\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nI agree with Pat in Oslo\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nthat it's dangerous\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nfor comedians because you have to watch yourself\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nso carefully\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nTwitter is not a good place to develop material\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nlet's put it that way\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nGraham do you engage with your detractors\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nor do you go back and forth\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nor do you leave them? No I block them\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nI love the mute button that's my favorite thing\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nThe mute is pretty great but if they talk directly to you\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nit just goes right to you\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nwe were talking about this the other day\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nNo once I mute them\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nthey are gone I never hear from them again\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nBut if they say to you if they say at Glinner\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nNo\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nI can never get this straight\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nDoes anyone have this straight in their head?\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nNo and I like to ask them a question\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\njust before I mute them\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nI like to say something\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nWhat makes you think that?\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nIf that's really what\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nmute is and I'm muting everybody\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nI could swear I think that mute only\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nworks with people that are like\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nhey I'm live tweeting the Super Bowl\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nand it's like I love you to death\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nbut don't live tweet the Super Bowl\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nand you mute them because they're not talking to you\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nbut if they were to say\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nI love that touch down\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nreminds me of Dan Harmon\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nit'll override the mute\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nMaybe it does work like that\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nand it's just that no one has replied to me\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nafter I muted them\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nThe only people\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nmost of the people that I want to mute\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nwe're talking about people that are talking\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\ndirectly to me\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nI only mute rude people\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nor people who say something that's just so dumb\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nor one guy like today who said\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nI said does anyone know\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nany good places to eat in Los Angeles\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nor something and he replied no\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nand he was like bye bye\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nToo snarky, too cynical\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nthere must be a good place to grab a dibble\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nI tell you another thing\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nabout the internet and I'm not sure if it's a good thing\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nor a bad thing, I was thinking about this today\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nis that it seems to me that\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nyou've got the high level sociopaths\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nwho are burying people\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nin shallow graves\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nand then you've got kind of lower level\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nwho never really had a way of expressing themselves\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\ntill now\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nand it's these lower level sociopaths\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nwho are like the whole gamergate thing\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nat the moment\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nthere was a discussion on one\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\n8chan or 4chan\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\none of these things\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nwhere they were seriously discussing\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nhow they could make transsexuals\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nkill themselves\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nand they were saying this is

01:35:43.000\nscared by this guy\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nLiam Neeson and the phone\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000\nwith his part of gold\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nin a few minutes\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nthey're gonna take you\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nhere's what you do\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000\ntell them they get three wishes\n\n01:35:57.000

Cthulhu\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nno\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nyou should get into that\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000\nI'm having a\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nI want to get into\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nLovecraft now\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nreally late\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nI just bothered to ask the question\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nwhat is the deal with this Lovecraft shit\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nI find him really hard to read\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000\nI find him a bit boring\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000\nare we reading HP Lovecraft\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000\nor is there a game called Lovecraft\n\n01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nno there's a game called Falsetto based on\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nHP Lovecraft stories\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nI was just talking about the whole milieu\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nI think it's interesting that there was a guy\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nwith people still to this day\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nit's easy to\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nI've got other shit to do\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nthe scariest take on Lovecraft\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000\nis actually Alan Moore's Lovecraft\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000\ncomics has anyone ever read them\n\n01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nAlan Moore wrote Lovecraft comics\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000\nhe wrote two comics\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nthat are just Lovecraft stories\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nand they're horrible\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nit's one of those things where\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nyou're reading it\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nand halfway through you wish\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nyou were reading it\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000\nyou know the kind of Lovecraft\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nthe universe right\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000\nyou get a book and you open it\n\n01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nand you go, oh my god\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nmaybe that's what it was going for\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nAlan Moore is a genius right\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000\nno it's great but it's horribly great\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nit's so funny that Alan Moore\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nhe's like a refined version of Stephen King\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nand so much of his shit\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000\nhas been turned into bad shit\n\n01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000\nbut unlike Stephen King\n\n01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000\nhe's not cool with any of it\n\n01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nStephen King's like, maybe the shining was alright\n\n01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.120\nI changed my mind.\n\n01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.760\nYeah, I met him a few times, and I told him\n\n01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.800\nI hadn't seen the Watchmen film, and he poked me.\n\n01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:49.240\nHe poked to say, you've got to get out there.\n\n01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.200\nNo, no, no, he's just very happy, very happy that I didn't\n\n01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.960\nand wouldn't say it.\n\n01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:55.240\nI've got to watch this.\n\n01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:57.280\nThere's a documentary in this very like gonzo,\n\n01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:02.560\njust like him talking like, I didn't really realize.\n\n01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.480\nLast year, I realized that Alan Moore was the common thread\n\n01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:08.440\nbetween so many things that were so culturally effective.\n\n01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.520\nI've got to get caught up on this guy.\n\n01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:11.280\nHe's great.\n\n01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:11.840\nHe's great.\n\n01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:14.480\nWhat were you talking to him for?\n\n01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:16.720\nI went to a dinner, and he was invited, or no,\n\n01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.480\nI was invited to meet him by a comic shop in London\n\n01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:23.400\ncalled Gosh Comics, which is a great comic shop in London.\n\n01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.200\nThere's almost nothing you can say that someone\n\n01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.240\nwon't clap for it.\n\n01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.360\nThat was a pretty deep cut.\n\n01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:29.520\nI'm from London.\n\n01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.440\nAre you from London?\n\n01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.040\nOh, awesome.\n\n01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:36.840\nAnd yeah, we just had a nice dinner.\n\n01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:43.520\nHow are you going to make IT crowd good for NBC with Neil\n\n01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.160\nGoldman?\n\n01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.280\nThe thing is, they very kindly asked\n\n01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.600\nme to come over after I kind of forced them to ask me,\n\n01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.200\nbecause all I want to do is pitch my idea of what\n\n01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.280\nthe show could be over here.\n\n01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:01.360\nAnd it would be unfair for me to say it out here\n\n01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.400\nbefore I say it to them.\n\n01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.280\nBut I just think, I was thinking about studio sitcoms\n\n01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:10.360\nin the States, and it seems to me there's only one show.\n\n01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:14.040\nNo, there's two shows that are like my show that\n\n01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.880\nare in front of an audience in the States.\n\n01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.360\nMarried with children.\n\n01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:19.000\nWow.\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.400\nYeah, not like in terms of quality.\n\n01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:24.560\nThe quality was up and down, but it was the same kind of.\n\n01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.240\nThere was no quality.\n\n01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:28.160\nNo, did you ever see the episode where they all\n\n01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.720\nhad to get their hair cut at the Lady's Salon?\n\n01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:31.880\nThat's very funny.\n\n01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:33.920\nI think I saw every episode of that show,\n\n01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.120\nbut it was great about it.\n\n01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.040\nIt was like, you felt like you were watching\n\n01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:38.880\na show that was made in someone's basement.\n\n01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:39.800\nIt was so crap.\n\n01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:40.840\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:44.040\nBut it's similar to my show in that it's kind of nuts\n\n01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.360\nin the real world in some ways.\n\n01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.080\nIt's kind of heightened.\n\n01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.240\nThat's what you're talking about.\n\n01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:49.360\nYou're talking about the relationship between reality.\n\n01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.880\nYeah, and the other one is soap.\n\n01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:51.360\nRemember soap?\n\n01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.800\nYeah, yeah, yes.\n\n01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.760\nSoap had that same kind of crazy.\n\n01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.560\nBut I remember soap as a child, so I remember it\n\n01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.920\nas a grown-up show, so I don't remember having mystical.\n\n01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:03.200\nYeah, the ventriloquist dummy, and all that sort of stuff.\n\n01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:06.200\nSo it was kind of crazy, and in later seasons,\n\n01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:09.640\nthey had aliens kidnapping the guy.\n\n01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:10.840\nSo it got really insane.\n\n01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.240\nSo they're the only two shows that\n\n01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.600\nseem to be kind of insane in the way that my stuff sometimes is.\n\n01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.080\nSo you're going to tell Bob Greenblatt,\n\n01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.400\nI want it to be like soap again?\n\n01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:20.600\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:21.560\nThe opposite.\n\n01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:22.640\nThe opposite.\n\n01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.520\nI mean, again, I don't want to say too much,\n\n01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:28.080\nbut I'm going to say to try and pull back on all that stuff\n\n01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.680\nand do what American shows do so well, character.\n\n01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.480\nAnd in terms of studio sitcoms, I'm\n\n01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:38.720\nthinking in terms of things like Cheers and Seinfeld, which\n\n01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.560\nI've said it before, but IT Crowd is just\n\n01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:44.680\nme trying to copy Seinfeld and getting it wrong.\n\n01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:47.840\nI just worshiped that show.\n\n01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.520\nThose were some of the happiest years of my life watching\n\n01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:52.040\nSeinfeld with Bob.\n\n01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:54.560\nI got caught up with it in syndication,\n\n01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:58.080\nand I didn't really realize the extent to which I was ripping\n\n01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:00.800\nit off until I observed other sitcoms\n\n01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.000\nand how structurally they were different from community.\n\n01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.760\nBut I thought that I was doing Star Trek\n\n01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.000\nbecause the bridge of the enterprise\n\n01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:09.800\nwas so necessary.\n\n01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:12.280\nSo the study room was like the bridge of the enterprise.\n\n01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:14.480\nBut it was really like that was Seinfeld's kitchen.\n\n01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:17.280\nAnd so you go A story, B story, and then they split off,\n\n01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:20.280\nand then they reconvene in an ideal community episode,\n\n01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.680\nwhich there are so few of.\n\n01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:24.200\nThey always go astray.\n\n01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:28.480\nBut yeah, it's like you have everybody coming in\n\n01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:30.680\nand going, I have this problem, I have that problem,\n\n01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:33.720\nand then they split off into these crazy things.\n\n01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.440\nAnd that wonderful thing that Seinfeld would often do,\n\n01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:39.720\nwhere you just did not know how they were going\n\n01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:42.600\nto connect the two storylines until a second before it\n\n01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:47.560\nhappens, and then you'd get this little explosion of joy\n\n01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.120\nwhen you realized.\n\n01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:52.440\nI mean, one example, that's kind of not an example,\n\n01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.880\nbecause it was slightly forced, but still great,\n\n01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:57.800\nis Kramer being mistaken for someone\n\n01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:02.240\nwho's got mental problems and ends up singing to Mel Torme.\n\n01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:04.440\nNo, no, Mel Torme ends up singing to him.\n\n01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:05.200\nHave you not seen that?\n\n01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:05.840\nYeah, I don't remember.\n\n01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.280\nOh my god, it's so funny.\n\n01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:10.440\nAnd it's one of those laughs that you think\n\n01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.680\nyou will never stop laughing at one point.\n\n01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:16.680\nIt's just beautiful, because he's just got\n\n01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:19.480\nan overcane in his mouth.\n\n01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:21.480\nAnd he's kind of like.\n\n01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.960\nWhat do you think of the office?\n\n01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:24.280\nWhat do you think of the UK office?\n\n01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.880\nWhat do you think of the American office?\n\n01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.320\nNo offense to anyone working on it,\n\n01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:30.040\nbut I find the American one hard to watch,\n\n01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:34.080\nbecause I really love that first series of the office.\n\n01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:39.000\nAnd I just find it odd that it's exactly the same relationships.\n\n01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.520\nAnd I know they moved off it later on,\n\n01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:44.280\nbut I don't know, I find it a little bit hard to watch.\n\n01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.200\nBut true, no fault of the show.\n\n01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:47.200\nI know it's a good show.\n\n01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.560\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:50.520\nBut you thought the UK one was like.\n\n01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.520\nI think that first series is mind blowing.\n\n01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:55.080\nYou don't have Gervais fatigue, which\n\n01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.480\nI have been told is a thing in England?\n\n01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.320\nNo, OK.\n\n01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:58.760\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:42:58.760 --> 01:42:59.360\nI made that up.\n\n01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.120\nWe were really.\n\n01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.280\nWe used to, I used to know him.\n\n01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.280\nAnd then he slagged off the IT crowd on his blog.\n\n01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:05.880\nAnd I was like, oh.\n\n01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:06.280\nWhat?\n\n01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:07.480\nYeah, yeah, it's like, oh.\n\n01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:11.560\nI don't know when we fell out, but apparently that's\n\n01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.880\nthe thing that friends now do to each other, isn't it?\n\n01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:17.280\nWait, I'm deadly curious about this.\n\n01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:21.440\nHow does Ricky Gervais make the time to articulate a slag?\n\n01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.760\nHe said, we got nominated for an award and he said,\n\n01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:28.840\nbest of a bad lot.\n\n01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:32.520\nI don't even know if that's so British I'm like.\n\n01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:35.520\nOf these bad things, it's probably the best.\n\n01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:36.480\nIt was the least shitty.\n\n01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:37.880\nYeah, it was the least shitty.\n\n01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.480\nOh, was he hosting?\n\n01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:40.080\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:41.200\nHe was just writing about it.\n\n01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.200\nOh.\n\n01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:43.600\nHe took time out of his day.\n\n01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:46.520\nFuck you, Gervais.\n\n01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:47.880\nGraham, I'm going to go on record and sing\n\n01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.440\nI Never Like Ricky Gervais.\n\n01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:53.240\nLet's get him.\n\n01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:53.840\nAll right.\n\n01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:59.320\nWell, I was curious, it's the Bell Tolls for us.\n\n01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.440\nWe don't have Spencer.\n\n01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:01.400\nI'm addicted to bringing Spencer.\n\n01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:02.520\nGraham, you don't know about this,\n\n01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:03.800\nbut this is the point in the show.\n\n01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:06.040\nWe try to crudely shoehorn in an ending\n\n01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.000\nto our unstructured show.\n\n01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:08.440\nOK.\n\n01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.840\nSo it gets a little awkward.\n\n01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:12.360\nAnd then the first funny thing I hear,\n\n01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:14.960\nI play a loud musical sting to it.\n\n01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:17.120\nAnd then we get the fuck out of here.\n\n01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:18.040\nOK.\n\n01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.160\nShit, I don't know.\n\n01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:20.000\nDan, you want to?\n\n01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:20.800\nDon't force it.\n\n01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:21.800\nDon't force it.\n\n01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:24.280\nLet's just, now we just take a couple breaths.\n\n01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:35.400\nWe're all going to die.\n\n01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:39.000\nShit.\n\n01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000\nI thought that was going to happen.\n\n01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:50.480\nLet's just embrace the sadness of this song.\n\n01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:59.000\nIf you've got everyone to sing.\n\n01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.280\nDan and I have kind of a Christmas tradition,\n\n01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:05.760\nwhere one year we got together and we changed the lyrics\n\n01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.880\nto this song.\n\n01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:09.000\nIt goes like this, Graham.\n\n01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.480\nDicks and balls and beer.\n\n01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:17.480\nDicks and balls and beer.\n\n01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.480\nIt's an Irish song.\n\n01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.480\nThe fire is warm.\n\n01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.960\nIt's a perfect storm.\n\n01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:25.960\nIt's dicks and balls and beer.\n\n01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:32.560\nIt's not enough.\n\n01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:35.280\nThey deserve better.\n\n01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:38.600\nThey deserve, is there an Irish Christmas tradition, Graham?\n\n01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.600\nYou want to share it with us, isn't it?\n\n01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:45.600\nWe celebrate Bill O'Reilly leaving.\n\n01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:49.600\nWe celebrate Bill O'Reilly's family being driven out.\n\n01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.600\nIs he from Ireland?\n\n01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.600\nNo, no.\n\n01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.600\nJust by name.\n\n01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.600\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.600\nThis game just sounds too Irish.\n\n01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.600\nNo, he's Irish descent, though, isn't he?\n\n01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.600\nIrish descent.\n\n01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:59.600\nYeah.\n\n01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:01.600\nIs there a word on the street about like,\n\n01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.600\ndo people just, people hate Bill O'Reilly?\n\n01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:04.600\nNo, no, they don't know who he is.\n\n01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:05.600\nThey don't know who he is.\n\n01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:06.600\nThey don't know who he is.\n\n01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.600\nThey come back and do TV shows in Ireland\n\n01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.600\nand pretend to be a normal human being.\n\n01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.600\nThey let him away with it because no one really watches TV.\n\n01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:16.600\nWhen people in, there's a...\n\n01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:17.600\nNo, sorry, people watch TV in Ireland.\n\n01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:19.600\nSorry, that's not what I meant.\n\n01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:22.600\nThis guy, Flanagan, who runs this venue here in LA,\n\n01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.600\nhe's very Irish and he's very LA,\n\n01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:30.600\nand he was explaining to me that he said this.\n\n01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:33.600\nNow, like, I'm submitting this to you.\n\n01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.600\nI want to, yes or no, he said...\n\n01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:36.600\nHe vaguely writes this.\n\n01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.600\nThe Irish in Ireland, they actually,\n\n01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.600\ncontrary to what you might think,\n\n01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:50.600\nthey're not repulsed by the millions of Irish-American tourists\n\n01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:53.600\nthat flood to the homeland every year.\n\n01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.600\nThey're kind of, they kind of like it\n\n01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:01.600\nbecause the actual Irish represent like a certain amount\n\n01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.600\nand like the idea that seed was spread,\n\n01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:06.600\nno matter how fat and gross these people are,\n\n01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:09.600\nthat come back and buy these like key chains\n\n01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.600\nand refrigerator magnets.\n\n01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.600\nI don't know, I'd never really...\n\n01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:17.600\nIn Dublin, you might not see it as much as kind of...\n\n01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.600\nBecause, you know, people get to Dublin and they're annoyed\n\n01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:21.600\nbecause there's a gap, you know,\n\n01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:25.600\nand there's kind of, there's no Irish fiddlers on the street.\n\n01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:27.600\nBut you go out into the countryside and there's a lot more...\n\n01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.600\nIs nobody selling cockles and mussels?\n\n01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:31.600\nYeah, no, you don't really get that anymore, you know.\n\n01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:33.600\nThe cockles and mussels business has dried up.\n\n01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.600\nIt's just a shame.\n\n01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:37.600\nYeah, but no, Dublin, when I grew up in Dublin,\n\n01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:39.600\nit used to really annoy me any representation of Ireland\n\n01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.600\nthat involved fiddles or people going,\n\n01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.600\noh, you know, because, you know...\n\n01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:51.600\nI was in New York and Chicago celebrate St. Patrick's,\n\n01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.600\nI think probably more than Ireland does.\n\n01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.600\nYeah, no, no, I mean, believe me,\n\n01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.600\nthe St. Patrick's Day celebrations in New York\n\n01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:01.600\nare the funniest thing to Irish people.\n\n01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:04.600\nThey are just so ridiculous\n\n01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:07.600\nand these kind of awful men\n\n01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:11.600\nturning their back on the gay Irish coming by,\n\n01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.600\nall that sort of stuff.\n\n01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:16.600\nThere's a pub in Hell's Kitchen, I think,\n\n01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:19.600\nand it's an Irish pub, and they have this big sign.\n\n01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:21.600\nI was there once with St. Patrick's Day,\n\n01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.600\nI wasn't there during it, but it was the day before,\n\n01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.600\ntwo days before, and there was a big sign,\n\n01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:28.600\nlike, big block letters that said,\n\n01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:31.600\ndon't sing Danny Boy. It's not an Irish song.\n\n01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:33.600\nIt was written by an English person.\n\n01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.600\nLike, if you fucking sing Danny Boy, we're throwing you out.\n\n01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.600\nThat sounds like a great bar.\n\n01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:39.600\nThat's really what I go to.\n\n01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.600\nBut I heard a great story from a band called,\n\n01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.600\na Northern Irish band called Therapy,\n\n01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.600\nwho were on tour with House of Pain.\n\n01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:50.600\nRemember, House of Pain, Jump Around?\n\n01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:51.600\nAnd House of Pain...\n\n01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.600\nWe could forget.\n\n01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:53.600\nYeah, but they were in...\n\n01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.600\nHouse of Pain was Jump Around?\n\n01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.600\nYeah, wasn't it?\n\n01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:00.600\nBut House of Pain, they were in Dublin,\n\n01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:02.600\nand Therapy were in their dressing room,\n\n01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:04.600\nand one of House of Pain's took their head in and said,\n\n01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:06.600\nhey, guys, come with us.\n\n01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.600\nWe found this great Irish bar!\n\n01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:12.600\nIn Ireland?\n\n01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:13.600\nYeah, really?\n\n01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:16.600\nBut I think they meant a bar that had a shamrock in it,\n\n01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:18.600\nor something, you know?\n\n01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:20.600\nEvery other bar wasn't an Irish bar.\n\n01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:23.600\nIt probably had a Celtics jersey in there, so I'm sorry.\n\n01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:24.600\nIs there a...?\n\n01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:26.600\nShit, I was hoping that would be it.\n\n01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:27.600\nI know.\n\n01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:28.600\nThis is when we start scrambling.\n\n01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:30.600\nIt's every man for himself right now.\n\n01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:32.600\nBut is there...?\n\n01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.600\nI mean, the answer is no.\n\n01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:37.600\nI'm wondering what...\n\n01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:42.600\nI'm not wondering what three intellectuals in London\n\n01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:46.600\nhaving a drink at a bar say about American culture,\n\n01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:50.600\nbut I am very much wondering what three Irish...\n\n01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.600\nI'll tell you, we used to love the regulars in our bar.\n\n01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.600\nWe used to go to this pub in Dublin\n\n01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.600\ncalled The International, me and Arthur.\n\n01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.600\nAnd there were always some really funny guys there,\n\n01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:05.600\nand they'd just be watching the TV.\n\n01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.600\nThey were there every day.\n\n01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.600\nAnd 9-Eleven happened, you know?\n\n01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.600\nAnd this guy was...\n\n01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:13.600\nHere comes our closer.\n\n01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:14.600\nYeah, we got our closer.\n\n01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:15.600\nCome in.\n\n01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:16.600\nBuckle up, everybody.\n\n01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:18.600\nAnd this...\n\n01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:21.600\nIf it doesn't have the power to close a show,\n\n01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.600\nthen I question its status as a national tragedy.\n\n01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.600\nI actually...\n\n01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:27.600\nI say that on record.\n\n01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:29.600\nWell, no, so basically,\n\n01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:32.600\nBin Laden, you know, was trying...\n\n01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:35.600\nHis name was starting to be floated about because of it, you know?\n\n01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.600\nAnd this guy was looking up at the TV,\n\n01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:38.600\nand you see the towers burning,\n\n01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:40.600\nand then you see a picture of Bin Laden.\n\n01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:41.600\nAnd this guy at the bar said,\n\n01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:44.600\nthere he is, the man of the moment.\n\n01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:49.600\nThat's how it's done, everybody.\n\n01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:51.600\nThank you for coming.\n\n01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.600\nAnd...\n\n01:50:53.600 -->
