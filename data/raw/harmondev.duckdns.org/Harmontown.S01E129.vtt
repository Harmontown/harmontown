00:00.000 --> 00:03.880
Tell me, baby, why you been gone so long?

00:03.880 --> 00:04.880
You been gone so long.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.000
For Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California,

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Tell me, baby, why you been gone so long?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Tell me, baby, why you been gone so long?

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
The wolfy sketches at my door.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown,

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Tell me, baby, why you been gone so long?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Thank you.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Look who's back. Comptroller Jeff Davis, everybody.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
I think they missed you from informal polls on Twitter.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
I wouldn't go on Reddit. I don't want to go on there.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
There's too much objective clinical...

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I don't think Reddit wants you on Reddit.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
If you're being talked about on Reddit, like, Reddit doesn't want

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
the town of Ferguson to be on Reddit.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
It wants to talk about...

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Because if it would get out, it would go,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
hey, we're a real town.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
But just from Twitter, every time I would go,

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
like, hey, we're doing the show tonight,

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
there's always a minimum of three or four obnoxious,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
like, and Jeff?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
So it's good you're back.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Thank you, Dan. It's good to be here.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
Thank you, Dan.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Oh, and I missed you as well. I'm glad you're back.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I missed you.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
And I was doing what they call playing hard to get.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
It's good. It makes a relationship stronger.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
In that men are from Mars, women are from Venus' book.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I remember the guy describing, said,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
women are waves.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
This is no longer politically correct to say.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Women are anything.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
You could say women are porpoises.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
It sounds bad now.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
But women are waves.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
They go up and down, and men are rubber bands.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
They go back and forth.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
They pull away, and if you let them pull away,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
they snap back.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Sounds like a big justification for a lot of hoohah

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
written by a dude.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
But I don't know.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I feel it. I feel it myself stretching back

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
and snapping back sometimes.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
Also, police brutality is like a rubber band.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
If you let it go, it stretches and stretches.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Also, if you put it on too tight,

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
it constricts you and you die.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
Well, I mean, it's not the goal to be sensitive

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
in these times around this subject.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
I do want to be a curmudgeon.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Let's do the cane-shaking segment.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Cane-shaking segment.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
I want to do more segments now that we're on video.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Cane-shaking segment.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
He's got a cane and he wants to shake it.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
He's mad because you are young and he's old

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
and he wants you off the world's lawn.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Knock it off.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Stop being so young all the time.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
I can't walk, so I'm shaking this thing.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
And I used to help me walk.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Dan?

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
It's good to be back.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
So, I was listening to a police advocacy lawyer

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
which is a great gig these days.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
The hourlies are like...

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
The police advocacy lawyer at NPR,

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
and they were talking about the Garner autopsy

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
and how the pathologist ruled it a homicide.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And the lawyer's response was,

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
well, homicide just means that one person's life

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
was ended by another person.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
It doesn't mean a crime was committed.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
And he's right, I guess.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
But it really leapt out at me,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
and this is called the cane-shaking segment

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
so you can't get mad at me for connecting these dots.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I just, like, I wanted to roll down the window

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
and shout at the...

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
It gets you.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
This is where refinement of language will...

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
These are your bedfellows.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
These are the people who speak perfectly.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
These are the people who are very polite.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
They always mean exactly what they're saying,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
or rather, they never do.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
But they never say the wrong thing.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
They never use the wrong words.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
And they're advocates of murderers.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
But it's not murder, it's homicide.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
So get your shit together and get off my lawn.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
It's kind of a rare, so weird moment in the news right now,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
like a strange harmonic convergence

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
where it kind of actually feels like the things

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
that are in the news right now

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
are the things that news is usually distracting us from.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
The death of journalism is in the news right now,

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
which is the most important thing to be in the news

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
since the death of journalism.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
The Rolling Stone thing is a hot button.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
I won't touch it, but it has brought the concept

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
of journalism dying and what responsibilities are

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
and how journalism actually works

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
to a generation that seems to maybe justifiably

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
because of the new media overwhelming them

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
with an increased news cycle.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
There's a lot of old disciplines

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
that have been forgotten, confirmation of sources and things.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
There's still a good journalist out there,

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
but let's face it, the worlds that we used to call tabloid

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
and all these things.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
We used to have different compartments for these things,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
and since the 20s, they've all been kind of merging.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I mean, it's a gradual, slow thing,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
but spiked with the internet.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
What the hell is the difference between real news?

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
It's not, just like real news sites.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
They still have the same fucking weird clickbait stuff.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
You can't tell the difference.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
But now that cops are choking people to death

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
and there's cameras everywhere, I don't know.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
You think maybe there would be like a little golden age

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
resurgence of journalistic integrity?

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Maybe. I mean, there's crazy shit happening.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
It's becoming very clear that being a team player

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
isn't necessarily the secret to world peace.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It's been kind of a leitmotif

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
in the last 20 years or so.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
What would you call the golden age looking back of journalism?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
When did you think?

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Oh, definitely, 1985. I mean...

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Was there ever a time?

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
I read you the following review of Back to the Future.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Sintillating with his beautiful locks of gossamer hair.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I don't know.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I told you when I walked out of Back to the Future,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Eyes of New York as a kid in 1985.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Was that when it was? Yeah.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
And I came out of the theater.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
It was a mnemonic device. The whole movie's about 1985.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
I told you this, right?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I walked out of the theater

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
and everybody poured out of this Lowe's Theater in New York

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
on the west side and everybody was beaming.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Everybody was so happy.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
We almost kind of walked out holding hands.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Like it was the most together you ever saw in New Yorkers

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
in my life.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
And they walked out and some guy was like...

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
He was kind of like...

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I would put him probably at 35.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I was like 11 at the time or 10, 11.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
And this guy just kind of shook his head,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
like kind of happily goes,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Spielberg did it again!

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I did it.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
And we all kind of paused.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
He kind of ruined the moment, but we all were like,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
yeah, he fucking did it.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
He presented it again.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
That screenplay took seven years to write, by the way.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Get off my lawn.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
It took seven years to write.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
You can't just shit these things out.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Why is your screenplay coming out then?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
It's seven years and it'll be good.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
And men stretch back.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
You gotta let them stretch back.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
It's just a pulpit for my agenda.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
People shouldn't have to get milk.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
It's bad for you.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Someone asked me to get milk.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I heard someone say what, the gas, what?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
It's just explaining.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
All right.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I don't want to do a

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
homicidal cop spree segment.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Yeah, I do.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Okay, let's do it.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Do you want new music for that?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Okay, let's do...

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Let's find something good here.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Let's do...

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Well, your job

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
ain't just to kill

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
people

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
before they commit

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
a crime.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Sometimes you...

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Oh, who's this guy?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Shoot him!

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
He had a gun!

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
He came in on the first verse,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
and he was reaching into his waistband.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
He was just singing about a woman.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I saw him reaching.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
You shot him there.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
He had a big red gun.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
No, that was a guitar pick.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Dan, that was a guitar pick.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
No.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
This is local.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Hollywood and Highland.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Two cops shot a guy.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I know nothing about this.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I'm going to put a kind of laughably

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
afterthought thing,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
like, I do know that

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
cops must have it

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
really bad right now, all over the place.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Many of whom do not deserve it.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
It's in the zeitgeist right now

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
that cops are terrible people and blah, blah, blah.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
There are people who still have to get up in the morning

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
and put on a badge and go to work.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
There was a crazy guy outside my front gate today,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
and I immediately remembered,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
holy shit, I need the fucking place!

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
There's a million good ones

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
and I've met

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
good people that also

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
happen to go to work and risk their lives to be a cop.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
It doesn't seem like the time or the place

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
for that disclaimer, but it also feels like

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I'm compelled to create that balance

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
because it's easy to fan the flames right now.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Anyways, I know nothing about

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
how the LAPD is doing.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Since Rodney King, the Department of Justice

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
took over the LAPD, they restructured it.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I don't know where we're at with that.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Someone in the audience might know more about it.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
And I don't know what the crime rate,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
how it was impacted.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I don't know how much of that is phony.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
We're all praying when we heard the cops

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
shot a guy

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
in L.A. in the midst of all this.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Didn't everyone...

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
One of the writers at

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Community voiced this and said

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
confessingly,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
confessionally,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I've never found myself just saying,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
please, God let them have killed a white man.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
The city just doesn't need it.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
The rain is fucking with our infrastructure.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
It's hard to drive right now.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
There's all that oil after a drought,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
and the cars are sliding.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Don't kill any black people.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
We just don't need it to happen.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
It looked from the photos

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
like a white enough guy.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
We're all fine.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Not that I see race.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
There's a split street. You don't see race, Dan?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
No, I don't. Who's that?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
What's that guy?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
He's got a red hat. That's what he is.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
It's Anatoly. We know him.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Who's that guy? He's exotic.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
That's it.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Stand up. Show me how exotic you are.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
That's all I see is the word exotic.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
What nationality are you?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I am Native Colombian

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
and East Indian.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Native Colombian and East Indian?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
But you have hair like a sexy Michael Landon.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
That's great.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
It is sexy feathered hair.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
You've got great Warren Beatty shampoo hair.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
It's really good.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
We all want to run our fingers

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
with this guy's hair, right?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Get over here.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I'm going to run my fingers.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Jesus Christ, that's good.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Can we pass him around like a bag of popcorn

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
and just have everybody do that?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I mean, that sounds...

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Racist?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It honestly, obviously depends on him.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
You want to go around

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
and have people run their fingers through your hair?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Just the front row, maybe?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I say people raise your hand

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
if you want to feel his hair.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
It shouldn't be compulsory.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Alright.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Colombian and East Indian?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
That's a good combo for hair.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
We've crossed the line into breeding.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
That's good.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
How are you with kids?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Can I trust you

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
to take the prey down

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
without piercing the throat?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
You'll just hold it?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Wait, now you've made up a dog.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Well, that's the analogy I'm going to go.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I was just saying, his coat is so soft

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
to manage a bit.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
With that particular combination, yes.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Yeah.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
They got to let Golden Doodles into the dog shows, by the way.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I got a fucking Golden Doodle.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
These things deserve to be recognized.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I got a Golden Doodle.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
These things deserve to be recognized

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
as the thoroughbred that they are.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Alright.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
My Golden Doodles are amazing.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
I watch that dog show. Those are bullshit dogs.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Dogs are all fucked up.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
They're all weird looking. Let my Golden Doodle in the dog show.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Alright.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Moving on.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
There's a split screen online.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
There's a photograph.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
There's the two cops.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Boy, they look cool.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
The cops look like movie cops.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
They really look like they're posing.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Which movie?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
The guy that got shot on Hollywood and Highland.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Somebody just brought through the photo

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
up in the writer's room today.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
This is all I've seen.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I'm not a journalist.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Please forgive me for whatever.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
You talk about it online.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
They brought up a photo.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
It was a split screen.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
On the left side is a photo that was taken

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
by just a bystander

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
who was there at the moment

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
when this guy got shot.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
There's a guy that's down

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
in the crosswalk.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
His face is facing the camera.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
It's Hollywood and Highland

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
and the two cops braced

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and obviously scared

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
and they did this thing.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
On the right side is

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
the crime scene photograph.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
After everything's been catalogued

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
and the guy's sitting there, it's the same scene

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
but there's little evidence

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
like markers everywhere.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
And one of the more prominent ones

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
is this evidence marker of this knife that the guy had

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
which is not in the left photo.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
It doesn't seem to be in the left photo.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
It seems like the left photo

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
is just a dead guy in a crosswalk

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
and then the right photo

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
there's this knife that's there.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
That's what it seems like.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I don't want to amplify

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
things that are already

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
not true but I'm reporting

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
on the gossip.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I was in Europe and I didn't see any news

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
so I'm completely unaware of all of this.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I've now dumped

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
everything that I heard today.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Somebody just threw up the photo.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
So Hollywood and Highland?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Both.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
On that very corner, you mean?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Isn't that where Hollywood High School is?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
No.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
That's Sunset, right?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
A friend of mine

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Chris Dermick

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I met him.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
He was driving down Hollywood

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
on Highland

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
and passed Hollywood down to Sunset where Hollywood High is

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
and he came to a stop at the intersection there

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
and he was two or three cars

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
behind the red light waiting there

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
and kids were getting out of school

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
and the car in front of him

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
a dude got out of a car.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
A young Latino kid got out, took a gun

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
and walked up to a kid standing there and went bang bang

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
shot him twice in the chest, got back in the car

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
and waited for the light to turn green.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Sounds like a time life book

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Old West or something.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
No one did anything

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
because everyone just waited for the light to turn green

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
and they drove off

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
and didn't just drive off

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
politely waited for the light to turn green

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
and drive safely away from the murder scene.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Right.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
So that is the world

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
in which police work

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
and that's what gets brought up in the comment sections on the other side

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
when we're all going like this is crazy

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
we're losing our minds

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
what is going on.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
It's saying like

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
it's a jungle out there and it's crazy

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
and it's you know like they're risking their lives

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
and nobody is wrong about any of this stuff

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
but I think the only

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
the person I'm going to go with

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
and I'm putting a ribbon on this so I can move forward

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
because I don't want to just like jump into this and go

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
like run out

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I just want to put a little ribbon on it

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
my

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
the way I'm looking at it right now

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
because what we learned from the Garner thing

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
is that this whole like God bless their

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
walking patient heroic souls

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
that Michael Brown family

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
you read their statement about

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
when the verdict came out

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
and they just you know they've

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
it was just like

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
I don't understand a human being that could respond that way

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
in this situation

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
but they were heavily emphasizing like the need

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
for cameras

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
cameras cameras cameras on these

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
cops it's a hard job

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
crazy shit happens for everyone's good

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
we're living a surveillance state anyway

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
aren't there just cameras all over these people

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
that are out there risking

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
their lives and protecting us

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
so that we don't have to have these fucking crazy arguments

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
but

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
the Garner thing is

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
on camera and it's like

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
you watch a guy get killed and it doesn't

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
really matter that much

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
so the what is

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
the important thing what is our take away

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
the why am I do why am I

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
what like no other podcast can talk about this

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
what is my role in this world

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
what the fuck

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
talk about community in a second

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
what is your role

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
why is it on your mind

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
it's just it's on everyone's mind

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
so I'm just talking about what's on everyone's mind

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I sound like I'm speaking with authority

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
because I'm speaking into a microphone and no one else is responding

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I am just a washer in the sea of this

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
so it just sounds like I'm pontificating

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I am pontificating but I'm not

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
like I'm not drawing

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
on any kind of like decisions that I've made

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
my current take away is just like

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
what this young lady said on an NPR

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
was like I think we really need to seriously

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
examine the way that we

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
look at the role of police

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
and the law

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
we have this

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
philosophy evolving where we think

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
that the first and most important thing is

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
compliance and that if we

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
have that then laws won't be broken

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
because everyone will be afraid of the police

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
and I think we're seeing about

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
probably 60 years of that coming to

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
the fruits of that are now

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
like just rotting

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
and falling into the street

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
and it's on the inner tubes now because everyone's got these

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
little dangly doodles

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
and so we're seeing

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
now it's just like you know it's weird

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
it's weird to have six people respond to

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
an untaxed cigarette sale

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
it's give them a ticket

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
and like it wouldn't nothing would have happened

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
like just give somebody a ticket

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
for things that have to do with finance

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
and let money do its beautiful beautiful work

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
and when

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
people are being physically assaulted

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
like then that's where the guns and the

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
chokings and the numchucks and stuff should come out

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
but I have no answers

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
but I have questions

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
and where our questions should have to do with first of all

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
how many people get killed every year by cops

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
we don't have those statistics and why does this happen

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
and if we're going to be a federal nation

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
maybe we should put the pedal to the metal

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
and just fucking federalize and be fucking federal about everything

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I never thought I'd say that but Jesus Christ

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
well

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
get off your lawn indeed

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I want federal government

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
knock it off your states

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I'm a bull mooser

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I don't think I had anything else that I ever know

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
unfortunately

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
how is married life treating you

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
oh it's great it fits like a glove man

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I should have been married a long time ago

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
because look at me look at this

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
can't do that single

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I know because I tried

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
it's just a miracle I got married

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
what do you notice is different about you

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
as a person from being recently single

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
to recently married

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I think that you know the important thing about marriage is

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
and I was actually talking to an ex-girlfriend

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
about this who's recently married and is now

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
pregnant

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
so we were having a little like

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
day new mom

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
like

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
the

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
the important thing about getting married is the

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
realization that not that

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
the other person now can't leave

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
it's

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
it's that you don't want to

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I know that sounds like a silly epiphany to have

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
logically that's in the air but

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
but emotionally it really kind of hits home

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
when you sit down and for me it was like I was writing

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
my vows and I was like you know this is

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
an hour and a half of doing something that I'll

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
never have never had to do before I'll never do

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
again what am I actually promising

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
going into this union and how do I

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
what do I feel and what's my job

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
and all this is just sort of like

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
clicking that happens

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
this docking of two pieces

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
of a space station

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
and it's

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
someone yelps

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
because it sounds like you're talking about

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
fucking

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I think you delighted

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
a lady back there

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
marriage

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
marriage is when this thing slides into this

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
other thing

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
it really is

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
like a turn of the century comedy

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
show tonight

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
it just feels like

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
now you have a

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
you get

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
to have a moment to yourself

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
where you're like I want to

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I want to be married I want to be married to this person

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
this person that whole thing about

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
somebody's you know accepting someone flaws

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
and all like it there is

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
like this change over from

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
a mode where something's

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
wrong you come home

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
there's no toothpaste I thought we said we need

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
it we need a toothpaste for like two weeks

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
and instead of like getting haunted by the

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
ghost of your dad and being like there's no

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
toothpaste

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
you're just kind of like there's no toothpaste

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I'm going to sign up for this

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
it's just kind of like what am I

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
an idiot I married a woman that's not going to buy

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
toothpaste I'm not an idiot so there's no

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
toothpaste who gives a shit what do I have an emotional

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
fucking position about toothpaste

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
it sounds like you might have a buried issue about

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
toothpaste

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I did I bring that up because that was like a

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
thing that was like a epiphany I had in the

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
whose job is the toothpaste is it a shared

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
responsibility it's nobody's job

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
that's why you have no toothpaste you got to

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
sign tasks

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
more importantly it's not going to end

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
the world if there's no toothpaste

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
it's like it's like worth a very

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
specific toothpaste size moment of grieving

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
as my couples therapist would say

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
you grieve you grieve the amount

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
the amount that toothpaste deserves

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
which is that much compared to

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
like choking a black guy to death on a

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
sidewalk

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
waiter tie it in that was nice

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
thank you like there's there's other

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
stuff to get upset about there's that you

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
don't have that doesn't mean that the

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
toothpaste doesn't mean anything because

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
we live in a police state it just means

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
that like you know

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
proportion out your

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
grieving like how what are you going to grieve

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
about today how much griefer you're going to

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
spend on the toothpaste

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
it sounds very romantic

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
there was a crazy guy outside the gate

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
glad I got that gate

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
the gate at your place but I'm glad I can call

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
the police to say he's outside the gate

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
please come choke him

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
the gate the gate in front of your crib

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
there was a crazy guy walking around

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
yeah he seems a little he's a little touched

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I think is that is that still correct

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I was just in Paris I've never been

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
to Paris before and I spent about a week

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
there and the crazy people there are

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
fucking great like when you see a crazy

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
guy yelling in French it was like this

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
it was like artwork it was really good

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
it was like

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I can watch this all night long

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
for all we know Napoleon was homeless

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
we're like okay whatever you say sir

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I think they have more theatrical

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
training I think that guy had a great

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
voice he could scream all night

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
well it's definitely a language

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
it's wheelhouse

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
it's passionate

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
exclamation yeah like oh

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
that's what I'm basing it on

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Pepe Le Pew never yelled like this guy

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I mean I saw a couple guys that were

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
really laying it down it was like arias

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
they were really like riveting

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
by the way Pepe Le Pew when have we re-examined

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
that through our new hashtag lens

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
that is that is uncomfortable

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
yeah we got rid of Speedy Gonzalez but we

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
didn't get rid of Pepe Le Pew

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
let's have some agency for cats that get

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
paint spilled on them

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
yeah not only was it insensitive to French

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
people that stink

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
it was just the rapiest skunk in the world

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
was that the idea that French people

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
stink oh yeah Pepe Le Pew

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
French people have B.L. that's why it's

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
absolutely not nice oh come on

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
that has to be it he was based on Charles

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Boyet

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Charles Boyet stink

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
no no because he's a little lover

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
oh yeah but also Pepe Le Pew

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
the fact that he was a stinky Frenchman

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
that's yeah

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
he said the rapy thing

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
I love an actor that would woo women

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
and they loved it

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
the idea that French are lovers absolutely

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
but also

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
he was trying to fuck cats

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
he was a

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
he was like a cross species

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
raper

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
if a cat happened to

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
walk by a white paintbrush

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
and look like a skunk back then

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
she was in deep shit

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
yeah and he said you know he window dressed it

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
with all of this romance but clearly

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
we knew

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
as an objective viewer that he was full of shit

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
he did not take no for an answer

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
oh

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
he was very terrible

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
and the way they drew the facial expressions

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
on the cat like it was a little

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
it was very realistic

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
wouldn't you agree

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I remember as a kid

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
pre-hashtag culture

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I'm remembering like being kind of a kid

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
and being a little bit like just

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
I didn't like the Pepe Le Pew cartoons

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
and I didn't like the

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
the cat was so

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
she was so traumatized

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
she was horrified

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
she was looking for the exits it was the worst

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
and the thing is you were never

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
rooting for Pepe Le Pew

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
you were always rooting for like please get out of there

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I was never

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I was never laughing at him either I just didn't think it was

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
you know I think animals beating the shit out of each other

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
it's really funny

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
like Tom and Jerry is amazing

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
like those little things they do to each other

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I mean all Pepe Le Pew ever wanted to do was

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
do that

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
and he just kept saying oh I stroke you

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I touch you oh my love

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I was like he'd do it over and over again

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
I know Wiley Coyote do the same thing over and over again too

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
but with different equipment

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
alright

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
speaking of which what was the Roadrunner

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
was Roadrunner male or female

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Callie you're an animator

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
big eyelashes kind of feminine maybe

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Roadrunner is a male

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I know that for sure

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
this is Callie get up

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
you're an animator Kali Kazoo everybody

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Kali Fontecchio

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
kind of like

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
fantastic animator

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
an artist extraordinaire

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
hello

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
hello Callie

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
nice to see you

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
I was gonna say I think I'm pretty sure he's male

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
but it's weird over the years

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
if anyone's familiar with Tweety Bird

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
he's male but he's been

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
systematically turned into a female

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Tweety Bird's male?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
yeah so the

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
the drawing of Tweety's actually based off

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
a caricature of Bob Clampett's

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
baby photo

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
like that's a it's just it was a joke of like

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
yo you got this big stupid head

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
really? yeah

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
and he was male he's male

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
I guess you're right I was

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
really successfully androgynous character because

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I never really thought about

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I kind of shocked to find out he's male

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
or he's female because I would be shocked

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
to find out Tweety had a gender

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
because what they realized they were selling a lot

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
of products to women and then they slowly

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
just kept putting like more hearts and flowers

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
and that's actually the last time I talked

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
to someone who works in marketing there

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
that's their biggest

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
thing of money that comes in like millions of dollars

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
a year just on Tweety

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
you go to Mexico there's Tweety Bird merchandise

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Tweety wanna

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I don't understand it there's like hookers

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
standing up to their knees and shit with roaches

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
crawling on them

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
horses spray painted to look like zebras and

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Tweety Bird

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
and I don't I keep trying to figure it out

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
yeah they love Tweety and Taz

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
they love Taz Megan Double down there too

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
and Popeye Popeye really?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Popeye's yeah there's so many like gangster

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Popeye sure wasn't there a moment

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
when wasn't there a moment when Porky Pig

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
crossed over into kind of kind of like very

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
feminine too like big long eyelashes

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
oh they've all done that that's like that's the running gag

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
with all of them I mean like bugs half the time

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
they're just making out with characters

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
no bugs just in Groucho where Groucho plays a lady

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
like he's doing a character

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
where he plays a woman all the time

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
and Bart Simpson does that too

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
but they started drawing Chuck Jones

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Chuck Jones is the one

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
who's famous for drawing everybody with

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
like very effeminate eyelashes

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
that was his gag I guess

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
like most of his cartoons have that

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
and you can see that even in like the Grinch movie

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
that he did everyone's got the big eyelashes

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
how do we get off on this what are we talking about

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
oh we're talking about Peppa Le Pew

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
he's a very rapey energy

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
and yeah I mean it's energy

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
you know he's like really he's really advancing himself on the woman

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
and it was never

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
it would be a crime

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
it would be less of a crime if it was

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
beloved I just I can't have never met a

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Peppa Le Pew fan

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
really? I actually like they also

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
they have I've seen a lot of merchandise for the girl

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
like that will be on girly stuff

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
the traumatized girl?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
like pajamas and things like

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I think there was an episode where she does

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
like fall in love with him

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
she flips it on him

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
why does that happen?

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
does she get knocked on the head or something?

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
and then he's like oh be careful what you wish for

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
and then he hates it

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
he's like oh for some reason

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
I don't like it when they want it

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
see you next week

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
I am what they call

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I am what they call

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
the top

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
it was the only loony tune

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
in history where a porky pig came out of the

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
end and said I have to think about it

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
it was very lucid

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
he didn't get very tongue-tied

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I mean talk to your children

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
about this

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
that's not all folks

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
look into it

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
it's weird like

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
none of that would fly today but they're all based on

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
like sort of stereotypes and like

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
kind of adult themes and things like that

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
it's like someone stuttering

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
we'd be like oh I don't want to

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
yeah well that's true

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
any kind of recognizable affectation

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
you're in a minefield now

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
but that's good, I used to

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
blanch it up and I'm like okay my challenge is

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
to somehow figure out

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
I have to have conversations in the writer's room

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
that aren't like oh it's like one of those guys

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
that talks like this

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
that's not a character

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
it's like okay

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
you have to talk about it, does he hate himself

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
does he, you know

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
I never pitched that character

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
that I just did

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
alright well

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
before you go

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
John Crick-Felusie, you know him right?

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
yeah, I used to work for John

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
tell him to come on the show

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I ran into him at a Divo concert recently

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
but he's all frantic

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
that's the coolest sentence ever

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
John Crick-Felusie

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
if you'd like to address the rumor that you're all frantic

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
actually it's Crick-Felusie

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
it's Crick-Felusie

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
no one ever says it right

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
I suffer from the same thing

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
no one can say my name

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I don't even try your name

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
I think Jonah Ray once said

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
I said it right when I brought you up here

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
oh yeah

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
you got my name

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
it's Italian, it's all phonetic

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
he's back five minutes

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
and

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
yeah I could try to

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
bother him again

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Cali Fantechio

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Cali Fantechio everybody

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
they were blindsided by that

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
who's this lady?

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
some of them were like that's my friend

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I have one of her pieces of art

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
she drew a Roy Orbison, I have it hanging in my bathroom

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
every time I pee

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I think of you and Roy Orbison

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
isn't that nice?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
she's a very very very gifted

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
illustrator

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
and I know I seem aloof

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
while I'm saying that

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
check her out Cali Cazoo right?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
on what? everything?

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Cali Cazoo

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
crazy guys outside the gate

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
was there any danger with this guy?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I nailed it

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
with all of my projected speculation

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
it was crazy guy, I said French crazy guy

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Peppi Le Pew Cali Cazoo

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
hahahaha

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
and chicken too

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
there was a guy Aaron

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
was texting me

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
all these delivery guys

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
would come over

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
someone would be delivering

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
a wedding gift

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
invariably they started

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
there's a crazy guy out there

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
he told me he wanted to eat my face

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
he actually said

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
he said to the

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
yummy.com guy

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
uh

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
which Aaron

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
got busted ordering from yummy.com that day

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
I want to know more about yummy.com

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Aaron's not here but he'll tell you all about it

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
she's a stockholder now

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
but the yummy.com guy

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
said

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
that he

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
this guy outside our gate

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
told the yummy.com guy that he had

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
a disgusting face

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
and then he wanted to hurt him

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
and then deMorge

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Harmontown

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
friend deMorge

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
came by Aaron

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
there was a birthday party for Dustin's girlfriend Elizabeth

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
and deMorge walked by the guy

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
he's still out there he just runs these long shifts

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
and he said

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
something so awkwardly racist

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
that it was almost not racist

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
but it was an earnest attempt to be racist

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
it called him something

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
it was like

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
really weird

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
everybody that he walks by

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
that makes them stop and go what?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
and then he repeats whatever he said

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
and then everyone goes oh

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
and then walks away

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
so he's not physically hurting anybody but I made the

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
I was like is he only in front of your gate

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
or is he kind of moving itinerantly around

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
he's bobbing around that location

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
and I was like asking Aaron like

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
how's he dressed, what does he look like

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
and I drew the conclusion I was like

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
that guy is like a relative of one of our neighbors

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
he hasn't been around in a while

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
he has half a support system

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
letting him out

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
and he's like haunting these spots

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
and he's a little confused and maybe

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
you know on the wrong meds

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
or off the half of them or having to

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
drink with them or something's happening and he's kind of like

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
he's gravitating this spot

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I was fucking dead on because there was a guy

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
a party guest came by I was like knew who the guy was

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
knew who he was related to in the neighborhood

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
and said I'm gonna call his mom and she doesn't know

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I was fucking nailed it

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
I'm like Dr. Quinn

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
medicine woman

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
medicine woman

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
she's more intuitive than a regular doctor

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Dan doing a camera take doesn't save that bit

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
you guys just appeal to fake people out there

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
alright alright so no more

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
I got no more ever notes

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
but the show's only just begun

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
I have a special

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
a special friend here

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
he's come to LA and he's

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
bopping around doing special projects

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
and I

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
saw on Twitter that he was in LA and I've been

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
tweeting back and forth over a long time

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
he made one of the best shows in

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
the UK

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
in the world

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
he's no fluke he's a repeated

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
British TV

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
with multiple successes one of which

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
you're a huge fan of

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
if you're willing to come up here and have a little

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
chit chat please come up

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
creator of father Ted and the IT crowd

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Graham Linnahan

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
think that the IT crowd

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
transcends even the Anglophile

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
factor like I would assume

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
everybody in this audience like probably

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
is like the first to

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
love like British shit more than American

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
shit it's a sort of

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I'm just trying to copy American shit

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
yeah I want to talk about that

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
in one second

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
but the IT crowd I think kind of

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
stands out as this real like

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
export like I think people that

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
which probably explains the continued attempts

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
to Americanize it

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
which I also want to talk in depth about

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
why I'm here as well

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
I'm trying to help one of those attempts

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
and the first attempt was a little bit of a

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
false start they boxed you out

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I found out about it on the internet

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
one day I saw oh the

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
pilot of the IT crowd

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
starts filming in a week or something

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
and yeah they just didn't tell

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
me about it they didn't tell me

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
I didn't get a single phone call

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
or anything in fact I think you know

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
the people who did it

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Sony? No

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I think they wrote briefly on a little

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
show called community

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
are you talking about

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
I know you're working with some of them now

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
no no no that's

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
totally different group the first time

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
was these guys you took over

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
when you stopped doing it for a while

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
was that Porton Grasio? Yeah

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
they tried to do the first

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I didn't make that connection

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I didn't know that

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
I try not to think about the whole

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
thing so

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
I hope I'm not incredibly wrong here

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
but yeah I think it's the same guys

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Porton Grasio are doing what?

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
They did the

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Porton Grasio did what? I think

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
if I know we were going to talk about this

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I would have looked it up again

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
but they did the original version

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
of the IT crowd with Joel

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
which is online

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
and you can watch if you are hating yourself

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
particularly

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
there's a

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
crazy weird

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
velcro level

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
a coincidence factor

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
in the relationship between

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
IT crowd and community

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I don't know how much of it is causal

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
and how much of it is completely independent of each other

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Joel McHale was on that attempt

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
to do the IT crowd

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
if you're correct Porton Grasio

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
who would later supplant me

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
we're running it

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Richard Iowani ended up directing a community episode

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
that's less coincidence and we're just

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
moving a fan of the IT crowd

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
but before Joel McHale

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
was cast or even considered

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
part of Jeff Winger on community

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
guess who I had dinner with

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
because people were jazzed about him

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
and they really wanted to meet this

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
hot actor

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Chris O'Dowd was going to meet Jeff Winger

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
possibly I did a little dinner with him

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
but Joel McHale wasn't even on the table yet

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
that's so weird

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
that's incredible

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
that's the one that really weirded me out

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
it might be because we're interested in similar things

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
and themes

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
I always thought community was the closest thing

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
to an IT crowd

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
because I don't think you can do

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
my kind of comedy

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
in front of a studio audience over here

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
quite as easily

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
the one we're doing here is going to be in front of a studio audience

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
but

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
I want to try and help make it

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
work more as a US sitcom

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
it's going to be a multi-cam this new year

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
I think that's appropriate

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
the multi-cam is not

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
by definition stupid

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
and one need only watch a British

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
or an old American show

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
or Seinfeld

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Seinfeld is not that old

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
that's the last big sitcom

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
isn't it

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
friends

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
did Seinfeld run after it

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
I can't remember

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
these aren't that old

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
things like faulty towers

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I just hate the idea of chucking

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
all these things in the bin

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
because they're supposedly out of date

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
it's because they satisfied

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
people so much that form

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
that it became automatable

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
and so the craft got a little corrupted

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
by the money

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and so it's the practices that are associated

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
with the format

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
it's not like people can look at

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
the shows that break big

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
because they really become culturally effective

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
and make people really happy

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
they're multi-cam shows

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
and unless you start counting mash

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
or you know let's say Beverly Hillbillies

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
there's that

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
it doesn't have that same chance

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
of really becoming

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
a culturally effective

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
cornerstone

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
I do think it's a little bit of magic dust

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
sometimes when you hear an audience laughing

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
but the important thing is

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
when you hear a real audience laughing

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
when you hear them really laughing

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
and I think that you have to just

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
you bring them into a studio

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
I almost think I'll ask you if it's true

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I think in the UK

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
because there's a lot less

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
like super

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
capitalistic

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
engine running the whole thing

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
the little less like fever pitch

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
like juice that baby up a little bit

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
who's that guy in the front

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
hey you know who we're bringing in? The Hammer Laffer

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
his name's Todd Hammer

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
he laughs at $75 an hour

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
he's a great laffer

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
I think you might have a bit more technology

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
as well around it

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
the only manipulation I do

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
is when I overrule the audience

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
because they often laugh at things

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
that weren't meant to be funny

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
or that aren't really funny

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
and I just kind of go no

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
you're overruled because the thing

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
that really makes people think it's fake

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
is when someone laughs at something that's not funny

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
was Father Ted multi camp

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
or was it all single? Yeah multi camp

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
but you did exterior stuff too

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
yeah and we played the audience

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
on monitors

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
especially since the internet

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
especially since I can actually talk to people

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I'm really really serious

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
about making sure that every laugh is

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
you know real and often

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
if you're you know what people don't realize

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
is you're often going between three or four takes

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
and so the audience laughed

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
and then if we weren't to do anything

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
to the laughter the audience would just go

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
and then it would just cut off

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
and then it would be a kind of little giggle

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
and you just kind of make it

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
the audience is like an actor

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
you're pretending the audience suddenly has to

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
you have to suddenly pretend that they're

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
an audience watching a whole performance

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
all the way through I think it's a great energy

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
to multi camp stuff like for the actors

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
it's like putting on a play you rehearse all week

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
and there's laughs that get laughs all week

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
and some that go away and some that change

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
and sometimes on the night the laugh that you

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
was in the bank the whole time

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
just doesn't work in front of the audience

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
and so there's an energy to the cast

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
where you're always alive and the writers are there

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
pitching lines and there is

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
a kind of an energy to a multi camp

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
I love it you know I love when

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
it doesn't get a laugh and running out

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
and having a quick kind of intense

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
conflab to try and come up with a better line

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
and sometimes it can be a pitch of a new line

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
or just an adjustment of the performance

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
and that's magical sometimes

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
yeah it really is and it's

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
you know it's why I like

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
to do it I don't do I've done a show recently

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
though called The Walshers

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
which is a single camera

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
and they're naturalistic actors

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
it requires

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
the camera to be up close

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
up the tiny little flickers

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
an audience would only get in the way of that

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
you know but there's some performers

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
who they're kind of lifted

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
on gales of laughter you know

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
a guy I work with Steve Delaney

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
who does a character called Count Arthur

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
that I'm writing at the moment

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
you know John Cleese

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
in Faulty Towers you know he's just

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
you can't imagine some of these shows without

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
like Kramer you know Michael Richards

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
in Seinfeld you know

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
without laughter he would just be

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
kind of weird

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
but also it's also

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
holding for real laughter when you come in

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
and something magical happens and there's a laughter

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
you actually like Carol Burnett's show

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
where they would hold for these giant laughter

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
oh yeah that's great too

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
and then like you as a viewer

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
watching through your TV I was a kid watching

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
like Carol Burnett and my carpet in front of my big Xenus TV

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
it's like you felt like you were part of that audience

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
you were part of the tribe

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
but when you're watching that I just don't think

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I think it's just at the moment

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
there don't seem to be many good shows

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
that have an audience you know but it'll change

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
it'll be one big show

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
it'll be great everyone will love it

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
and suddenly everyone will be like

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
why are you doing single camera stuff

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
it'll be the IT crowd because I'm sure you're at a great network

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
that respects comedy

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
where is it

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
NBC

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
alright

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
this one's gonna last forever

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I can't have this conversation

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
into a microphone

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
no you can't

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
don't take him down with you

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I mean I'm still in bed with them

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
there's still you know and a community is now owned

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
by three entities now one of them is NBC

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I can't

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
I can't begrudge them

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
we've got Chevy Chase doing Douglas though

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
that's good

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
that's fantastic

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
you're gonna need

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
to go single camera for some

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
elements then

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
he is more a machine than man

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I wanted to ask you

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
is this on camera actually

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
do I look okay, do I look awkward

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
you look great

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
they call you Irish Dan Harmon

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
that's all I ever want

46:55.000 --> 46:59.000
they call that an Irish compliment

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
are you familiar with the phrase Irish Medicine

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
or is that a horrible American phrase

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
no I've never heard of it

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Irish Medicine

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
that doesn't work

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Irish Medicine is saying to somebody

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
who thinks they're having a heart attack

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
but probably isn't should I call an ambulance

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
that's great

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Irish people would really approve of that

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
that's great

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
that's yeah

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Irish Breakfast is a whiskey and a cigarette

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
what is it

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
that's a Mexican word

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
we had a book of American slang

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
and it was just filled with it

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
it was just like a Chinese landing as a crash

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
and okay

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
you guys are gonna be okay

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
the book was

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
written in 1903

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
and you're gonna be fine

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
that book was flagrant

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
really amazing

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
it was really amazing the formula that would develop

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
everything that's Chinese was

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
backwards, it was an inversion

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
and everything that was Mexican was slightly less so

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
oh this is a real book

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
it was just like oh you get to the C's and the M's

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
and it was like

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
it's a whole book of just racist terms

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
it's called a dictionary of American slang

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
but it could have easily been called

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
a dictionary of racist modifiers

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I saw a book today

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I was in Barron's and Noble

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
and I saw a book today that was called

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
something like

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
I don't know what it was called

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
one bit of it was normal but the other bit was

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
crazy and it was

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
the subtitle of it was something like

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
the guns of bad men

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
it was a book of guns

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
and it was just

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
this is like an encyclopedia

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
of guns of bad men

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
guns like bang bang or

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
yeah but that's how it was written

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
the guns of bad men

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
why don't we call this book

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
the guns of bad men

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
it's just like Billy the Kid

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
it was his weapon

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
he used this kind of thing

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
but it was just that weird title

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
that was the end of a long dinner

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
with a frustrated literary agent

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
who was like

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
no god damn it

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
triggers and tribulations

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
and the lit agent

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
was like do you understand everyone

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
regrets buying this book

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
we're going to be lucky to sell five copies

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I'm going to title it for you

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
alright you're just like oh yeah

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
you wish you could yeah fucking

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
there's one guy at the back

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
who never gets to talk guns of bad men

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I wanted to ask you

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
you brought up John Cleese

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
who is credited with

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
a thing that exists in the UK

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
that doesn't exist in American TV culture

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
I heard this from I think

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Edgar Wright

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
there's a phrase for it

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
something to do with four seasons

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
and out like do you know what I'm talking about

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Faulty Towers was four

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
you guys called series

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
oh two yeah only 12 episodes

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
I'm already wrong and I haven't even started

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
but it was like there's a set amount

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
of episodes that a British TV writer

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
looks at as being dignified

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
and beyond that you're just like

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
what am I American I love that

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I love that Simpsons joke

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
where it goes Britain's longest

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
running sitcom see all

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
eight episodes next week

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
but uh yeah

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
but it's because we don't

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
it does not really a team writing culture

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
and so

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
you can get burnt out you know like

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
I was quite proud of getting as many series

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
of IT crowd as I did because it was

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
when you write on your own you know it's just not

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
I realized too late this isn't fun

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
I'm not enjoying this you know

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
and you get worse and worse every year not you

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
the royal you

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
the I just like I feel

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
like I'm dragging my

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
brain along concrete and it's like this

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
dog that won't heal and

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I'm like in order to be as good as a season

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
five

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
story I have to like

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
I just have to hurt myself and it's kind

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
of sad yeah yeah but do you

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
feel that that even with a team I mean

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I mean isn't it easier

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
the team can only I mean like

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
the team has this

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
tremendous amount of power

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
if I ask

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
them for 50

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
names for a new disease

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
if I if I if I can quantify

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
it if I can if I can give

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
them instructions they

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
are so much more talented than

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
I could ever be about like jokes

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
you know and but it's

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
there's I'm a victim

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
of my own

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Christ mythology like I

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
am I've I've I've been

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
fired and rehired and I can't these

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
kids that are the only people that would work for me

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
they're they're so talented and so

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
reverent there's no I

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
can't I can't just say

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
you guys you guys write a story

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
yeah it's like it's just

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
coming to wait for me to get tired of Minecraft

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
and then like okay now he's

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
now he's going he's going he's going

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I don't know I have

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
I'm not a good leader I don't know how to run

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
a room he said it he said

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
it fire him fire him

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
yeah the last time I said

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
that yeah but it still it

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
must be better though than I mean the whole

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
thing the conversation with me goes

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
is this funny and then I

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
say I don't know

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
that's what I do all day

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
yeah I I mean I yeah I defer

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
constant I love like

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
the my favorite thing is if I

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
can if I can write a story if I can come up with

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
something and then I can I can actually

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
go through the script and then

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I finally learned this after like four years

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
of doing a TV show like

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
how to that you're supposed to just

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
do this that like write a shitty script

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
but have it make some semblance

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
of sense and like then go

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
through and then you put like

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
I put three question marks

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
I don't know who taught me that I don't know if that comes from

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
one show or another that's a standard thing

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
but three question marks and then

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
like Chang comes in and says

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
they go where were you it goes like

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
I'm an hour late because

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
question mark question mark question mark

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I I fought

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
a German shepherd over

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
a butterscotch candy and I lost

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
and it's not funny and it doesn't matter

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
and then I just ship it out to a room

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
full of geniuses

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
who work for Colbert and

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
the onion and the lampoon and everything

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
and they and they return to me

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
the same script so it says

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Chang injures the room where were you

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
I got fought and then there's a list

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
separated the slashes and it's just

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
take your pick and it's just

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
barricingly long and they love it

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
because in that room there's no wrong answers

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
and they just get to they just get to

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
flourish I'm sure there's all kinds of

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
horrible emotional things that happen to them in there but

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
they don't

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
want me in there and

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
because it would be weird actually I used to

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
joke about I never go in there but

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
they're like we don't want you in there really

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
yeah we don't hate that I'd like to be in

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
there I'd like to just you know

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I don't know to help or to judge

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
no no to help to

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
kind of to have people make me

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
laugh sitting

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
and smiling my own

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
yeah well I

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I used I I Twitter

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
has been interesting on some of that because

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
sometimes people suggest things

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
and

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
you know and you rarely get

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
something good but God someone said something

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
brilliant and they said

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
they said it's really funny

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
they just said I was on the toilet

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
today and I couldn't get up because the

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
cat fell asleep in my trousers

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
you can have that one

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
for free

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I will indeed have that one

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
that is a good little slice of life

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
what a great reason for someone to be late

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
yeah

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
all I added all I added was

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I didn't have the heart to move

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
that's a great little yeah specific

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
that's what like good good comedy

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
writing is like a little specific textural

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
another thing happened

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
on last series there was

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
there was a competition

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
that was done for some charity so I

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
you know couldn't say no I didn't want to say no but

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
they said

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
the thing that was auctioned

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
was a chance to

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
be get your name

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
in my in one episode of

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
my new show you know so I said okay

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
thinking the name would be Roger Smith

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
or whatever you know

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
and the name came back and it was

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Rocky Fuglar Hagerty

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
which is a bonus

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
that is a money python name

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
but it was kind of a bonus but the show I'm doing

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
at the moment is sort of set in the real

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
world so I was trying to figure out a way

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
and we just kept

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
and finally I

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
I got in touch with them and I said are you

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
because I was finding it so hard to place it and I was

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
like are you serious it's like really a name

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
it's like a real name you know that was

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
a competition don't give me any fake

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
made-up names and they said no no that's our

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
dog our dog is Rocky

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
and our family name is Fugler Hagerty

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
oh sorry

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
I thought that was funnier it does

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
but Fugler

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Hagerty is funny in its own

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
right I guess if the

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
name was Tim Fugler Hagerty

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
it would still be bad so in the end

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
a guy has to kind of make up

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
a fake name and so it

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
worked that he was I hate

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
making up names

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
my scripts are filled with

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
the casting director goes nuts and she goes

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
do you understand these are human beings

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
and I can't offer

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
the part of suit guy to Jeff Goldblum

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
and sweater

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
person and other guy

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
you know who's amazing at that

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
is Arthur Matthews who co-wrote

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Father Ted with me

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
he's the one who came up with names like

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Father Noel Early

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
and on Toast

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
the new series is doing it

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Clem Fandango

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Clem Fandango

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
No more Clem Fandango

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Ray Purchase

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Ray Purchase

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Ray Purchase is just

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
if you've not seen Arthur

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
probably a lot of you have seen Toast of London

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
but if you've not seen Father Ted please go rent that because it is delightful

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
it's so funny

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
thank you

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
so you guys

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
IT crowd got a fifth season

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
like commissioned

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
like they said give us a fifth series

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
they wouldn't have turned it down

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I don't think I ever kind of

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I know what happened

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I tried to write a fifth season

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
and I just got really tired

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
and I thought no this is done

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
but I had enough ideas

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
left to make the special

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
because I really wanted to do

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Douglas doing secret millionaire

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
and I had one or two

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
other ideas that I thought were funny

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
and so I just really tried to

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
squeeze them all together

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
and then when you moved on

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
to something else did you find a rejuvenating energy?

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
yeah absolutely

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
I'll write community forever

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
but it's just like

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
man it is like

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
like flint against

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
steel

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
it's just a machine

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
it's just a machine over here

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
just the desire for more

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
the Simpsons blows me away

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
you know all due respect

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
I hear it's gotten really good again

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
or like one season ago

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
it was really good

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
but you know

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
it's just crazy how long it goes on

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
South Park too it's like endless

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
I can't imagine how the

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
how the Simpsons is able to

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
like

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
it's

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I just don't understand how they can sit there and go like

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
what if Bart

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
what?

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
wasn't there a thing

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Sam Simon telling me this

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
they would have like two

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
they would write two different bowls

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
of paper like there was

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
a line of A stories and B stories

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
like a garage sale and then someone goes

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
to the moon and they just picked two at random

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
I don't know if that's true

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
that was great do you know what I used to love about the Simpsons

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
the way you can look at an episode

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
of Simpsons like in the

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
golden age

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
and the opening

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
60 seconds will happen and you'll have no idea

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
what the rest of the episode is

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
that was delightful

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
I was very inspired by that

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
I don't do that on community or anything

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
but I think that's so fucking cool

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
because you cannot

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
you're like oh this episode begins with

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
like hey Mars where's the little

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
watermelon let's go we gotta go get more watermelon

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
and then for seven minutes into it

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
you're like oh this is the outer space one

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
it's incredible

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
it's so weird

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
but the thing about it is

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I think the biggest problem

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
with it is because they're the same age

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
there's only so many

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
times they can do certain emotional

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
storylines like I used

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
to love when the Simpsons got sad

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
like you remember when

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Homer met his mother

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
and a shot of him

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
just watching the highway

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
my favorite is when

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Dustin Hoffman is the substitute teacher

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
oh yeah

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
you are Lisa Simpson

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
there was a change on that

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I spoke to him on twitter about that

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
he said he still loses sleep

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
because the line you are Lisa

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Simpson didn't have an exclamation mark

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
but it's better without it

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I cry every time I say it

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
the first time I'll still cry right now thinking about it

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
it's the best

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
the exclamation point for me

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
would have softened it a bit

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I said

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
why are you yelling at me

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I didn't see Spencer when I came

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
he's taken the week off

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I think he's not coming

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
oh shit this show is

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
even better organized than it appears to be

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I'm not listening at home

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I was impressed that he actually

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
exercised the

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I'm going to think I'm going to take the week off

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
and then I said

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Jeff's coming back

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
and Graham Linnan's coming back

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
fuck

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
which I thought meant he might come

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
but I think maybe

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
yeah that's good

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
that's a way to connect that dot

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
it's good to be back

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
you missed Adam Goldberg didn't you

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
no

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
hey Adam how you doing man

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
are you here

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
good to see you brother I haven't seen you in a long time

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
so you're working with my old friends Neil

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Goldman and Garrett Donovan

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
who started community with me

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
if there's a community

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
biopic whatever that would be

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
the story of the behind the scenes

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
of community

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
there's no way you can make me the protagonist

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
because I'm a psychopath

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
who would you cast as you in that biopic then

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Robert Downey Jr

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
it's

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
embarrassing that you had to ask

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
the lack of hesitation to what's

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
embarrassing about

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
it's

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
that kind of

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
gallant wit that only rdj could

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
capture

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
the

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
protagonist of the movie about the making

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
of community would have to be Neil Goldman

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
because

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
he got assigned essentially

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
to

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
an overall deal with this company

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
and they got assigned to wrangle

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
this show by this guy who would never run a

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
show and I always wonder

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
about the world from his perspective

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
memories

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Neil do you ever want to come up

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
and talk about anything

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I do not

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
that's why he's

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I call him the schmoo back then

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
because he's politically facile

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
he knows

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
he's got a bigger house and he's

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
going to work longer and has worked longer

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
because he knows how to

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
he doesn't have the ego

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
and the

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
the backbone

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
wow

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
woo

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
who plays

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
you in the biopic about you

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I don't have a fast answer

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I'm going to go Liam Neeson

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
now I'm going to

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
what is it about Liam Neeson

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
he's Irish

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I like the way Liam Neeson suddenly

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
is the guy you called kick ass now

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
it's amazing I think

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
my number I'll watch it anytime Liam Neeson

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
fighting a pumpkin

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I don't care

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Dan how would that

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
go

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
hang on

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
let me see if I can find

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
a sound cue for that

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
is this the trailer

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
this is the voiceover from the trailer

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
for the Liam Neeson versus a pumpkin movie

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I don't have the music

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
you just go

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I want you to understand

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
something

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
pumpkins just lying on the floor

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
by the phone

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I'm trained to handle things

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
like you

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
you're orange

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
you're

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
round

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I don't give a fuck

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I have a certain set of skills

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
now I'm just doing

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
the weird Al Yankovic version of that

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I could stump things

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
it would be more interesting

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
if Liam Neeson was warning you about pumpkins surrounding your camp

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
they don't care

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
have you seen the Jurassic Park trailer

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I saw

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I saw like a little

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
people cheering for it

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
the park is open

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
there's a new Jurassic Park

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
but there's a line in it

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
there's a line in it

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
the worst trailer line I've ever heard

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
it's unbelievable

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
apparently they've created

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
a new super dinosaur

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
and that's established

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
and then later on

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
halfway through

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
that's a good movie so far

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
so far but this is the trailer bit

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
and if this is in the trailer

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
can you imagine what the film is like

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
but he says

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
someone says

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
that depends

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
on what

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
and he goes

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
that depends on what kind of super dinosaur they've created

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
in that lab

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
that's not it exactly

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
but that's more or less it isn't it

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
what the hell is that

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
that's not a cool line

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
that's not Yippee-ki-yay motherfucker

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
that's shit

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
that's like in the 50s when they called spaceships

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
spaceships and ray guns and robots

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
that's like if you were asked

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
your 90 year old father

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
was about

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
apparently there's a huge dinosaur in the lab

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
and it's the fastest

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I've seen that guy from

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Guardians of the Galaxy

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
yeah it feels like

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
that feels like a bad decision

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
to be in that movie I think he'll be fine

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
he'll be fine

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I think the film might be bigger than him and it might

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
like there's a bit when he's racing raptors

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
what's he doing racing raptors

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
he's gonna be the sexy awesome raptor trainer

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I know

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I learned from Jurassic Park 1

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
that velociraptors are cheap speed

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
he's gonna be that's the thing

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
there's a little bit of insidious genius to that

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I can't tell if it's the dumbest thing

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
or the smartest thing in the world

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
that the raptors which are the

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Ron Silver in heat vision terms

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
of the first movie

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
I couldn't think of another analogy

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I can't my brain is dying

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
the ed 209

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
the ed 209 that's great thank you

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
the ed 209 of the first movie

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
where you know the debt impulse

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
and a sequel to like

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
they're the good guys

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
you see a shot of Chris Pratt on a four wheeler

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
and there's like raptors running alongside him

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
like golden retrievers

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
is he racing them or are they chasing him

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
they better be chasing him

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I think he's showing up to save the day

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
because here's what I think about Chris Pratt's character

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
here's my prediction like there is a cheetah speed guy

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
and now he's the bad guy there's gotta be a guy

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
that's like come on you raptors

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
come on you lot ants

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
and Chris Pratt comes up and goes like

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
they don't respond to negative reinforcement

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
oh yeah

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
well you know who those

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
didn't respond to negative reinforcement

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
they

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
King Kong

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
he was a bigot

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
he's just as dead as all these fucking lizards

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
are gonna be

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
just gotta disagoo with your attitude

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
and then he's like

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
well let's see you get dislawed into the cage

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
and then he's brought his own raptors

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
from like site nine or something

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
and he goes like

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
rocker zippo

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
he like

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
he blows into Sam Neill's

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
uh

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
esophagus mold

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
and then the raptors like

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
and they do what they're told

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
but they're kind of like there's a begrudging respect

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
he's like he's like

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
he's like hold you get them to do what you want

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
like that and he's like

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I didn't get him to do what I want

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I let him do what they want

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
and he's hit that Chris Pratt

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
has hit that sweet spot where it's like

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
he's all the women want to

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
want him to make out with them and all the men don't mind

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
and that's the key

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
you don't want to get into that

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Tom Cruise gutter where it's like

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
all the men are like yeah I can

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
are there any kind of comic relief moments

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
with Riker and Zippo

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
no that would be doing it bad

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
you want the raptors to be badass

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
and you want Chris Pratt to be like the voice of them

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
you gotta let them be cool

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
they're clever girls

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
but he'll be cool

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
in American movies

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
going from TV to movies

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
there's some rule

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
you get two movies

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
you can do a shitty movie and then a good one

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
there's math you can break down

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Seinfeld couldn't survive it

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
the math is unforgivable

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
going from TV to movies

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
but if you go from TV to movies

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
you can hit these thermal events

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
of success and then you have a 25-year career

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Matthew McConaughey

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
he went away and now he's writing high

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
in a thermal right now

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
he's speaking strictly about TV

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
actor

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
making that jump

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
we kind of haze people

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I don't want to watch Andy Murphy in a movie

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
but anyways

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
how about those cops huh

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I see your retweets

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
you're kind of a dissident

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
you're on the side of the anarchist

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
yeah

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I'm on the side of people who don't kill people

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
for no reason

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
it's a bold stance, Graham

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
for an Irishman

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
just for Irishness

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
but no, I just think

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I try and retweet things

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
that aren't going to inflame things

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I try and be careful

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
after a few early mistakes

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
on Twitter

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I'm very careful before I

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
tweet something that looks like it's going to

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
just kind of burst into flames

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
you know what I mean

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
do you address

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
because I know you don't

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
sorry to interrupt but

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
what you were saying earlier

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
no, fuck you

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
to me it's the most fascinating thing

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
because it's the camera thing

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
it's the fact that we all have cameras

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
and it's all this stuff

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
has just been going on forever

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
and you can just see it

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
and it's like a light's been switched on

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
and everyone's going oh look at all this shit in here

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
you know

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
and that's what I just find fascinating about it

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
and I think that I like to try and

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
make the light reach further

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
and I got a big following

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
for me a big following

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
so I get to

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
spread it out a bit

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
this is an interesting analogy

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
people tend to think of it in terms of bandwidth

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
or like extra channels and things

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
in terms of like we've been groping around in the dark

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
in candlelight or something

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and then they have the lights go

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
and there's this sort of like

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
oh my god

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
that person looks

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
completely different than I thought they did

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
there's more people over here

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
they weren't even making any sound

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
now I can see them

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
and there's some people that are reacting to that

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
there's part of the human it's like

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
you scream in terror and you start doing crazy shit

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
and then there's other people who are like

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
you can scientifically find out more

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
now

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
but the problem for the place

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I think is that I would imagine

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
there's a few systems that they have in place

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
you know

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
if you shoot a guy and just

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
drop a knife near the thing

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
but that doesn't work anymore

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
because now there's two shots

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
and I don't think that

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I think that they're just gonna have to

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
adjust

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
it'll be interesting to see how that plays out though

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
we have this like overwhelming tendency to side

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
with the system that keeps us safe at night

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
and it does keep us safe at night

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
and it's like one of the most disturbing things

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
that we're seeing is

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
the revelation of

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I think as Jeff has always said we're a right of center country

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
we can say

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
we can talk all we want about it

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
we have a bipartisan system and blah blah blah

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
we are in an empirically

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
ideological spectrum we are right of center

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
we are a fucking empire

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
we'd have to be right of center

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
we can't be centrist and control the planet

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
we have to

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
have like a conservative slant

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
on things we like the way things

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
were yesterday a little bit more than we like

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
things are gonna be tomorrow

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
yeah we didn't have to think about any of this stuff in the past

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
you know cops are great

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
criminals were bad and even if we don't like cops

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
even if we

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
you know like have no reason to love them

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
and it's not gonna line our pocketbooks or anything

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
there is a muscle that flexes

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
when somebody

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
says in an article

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
you know this guy forget about

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
cops let's

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
broaden this out into

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I don't want to fan flames with my language

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
can we just speak and stuff

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
the rape culture

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
consciousness there's this whole thing everything that we're talking about right now

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
there's a phenomenon that happens

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I think when you read a piece

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
when somebody is activated

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
somebody is being an activist and they're writing an editorial piece

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
there's a muscle

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
that I feel that reacts

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
like before I even know what I'm doing

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I want to compensate

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
because I don't want to all at once

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
just be told that everything

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
is darkness and blood

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
and terror

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
and wrong and

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
what I thought was black is white

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
but I think the way you can

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
you know

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
live in the modern world and

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
be okay about it is you gotta think to yourself

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
you're helping the good cops

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
you know the good cops don't do

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
stuff like this

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
so if you're shining a light on the bad cops

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
you're helping the good cops so if we want to

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
help the good cops we've got to

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
we've got to do this we've got to try

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
and get the word out about the bad cops

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
when do you get mad

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
you retweet

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
you kind of curate you present these articles

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
and I click on them and I go wow

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Graham's the kind of guy

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I want to be like he reads

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I just click on what you read

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I skim it and I go

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
you know what's fucked up

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
there's these drones

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
they're everywhere

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
just trust me

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
but it's like

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
when do you

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
are you ever

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
supposed to say

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
it's a dumb question

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
because it's a case by case

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
basis I think there's some people

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
on Twitter that we want

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I don't want to hear what Angie Harmon has to say

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I don't want to hear what Dan Harmon

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
has to say probably

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
there might be other people that are like

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
fuck yeah I want to hear what Pat Oswald has to say

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
but it's the other

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
people I'm more interested in

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
the people who are like near

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
the scene and take a picture

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
there the people

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
that's one of the reasons I love

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Twitter it's brilliant being in touch

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
with people like you and

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
other people I admire but

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
it's also great to

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
when something happens to drill down

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
and find the first person who saw it

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
that's the thing when you talk about the light

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
coming on and seeing all the cockroaches

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
that we didn't know that were there in the kitchen floor

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
now the implied fear

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
for me is that the light can go out

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
and when that light goes out

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
we're going to be fucking horrified

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
that's why I think everyone should be

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
a member of the EFF

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
over here the open rights group in the states

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
the thing

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
you should fight more than anything else

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
is your internet rights

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
because we suddenly have this ability

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
to see

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
and to talk to each other

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
and it's being chipped away

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
all the time just little things

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
like net neutrality and all that sort of stuff

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
they're constantly trying

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
to stop us from talking to each other

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
but we've suddenly

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
got a bit more power now we shouldn't give it up easily

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
we're going to look back on these days

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
and be like holy shit you could

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
can you imagine

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I mean I think there's a lot of bad things about it

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I feel sometimes that I don't know

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
as many physical friends

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
in meat space as they say

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
as I used to

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
and the people I know on Twitter and so on

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I know them in a very kind of light way

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I mean you can literally just make them go away

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
if you want to

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I think all that's a bit sad

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
but at the same time I think

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
there was some way in which we were all a bit lonely

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
before this

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
and suddenly we can all talk to each other

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I think that's incredible

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
and when people used to kind of come down hard

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
on Twitter and Facebook they used to get really annoyed

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
like the social network

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
film just really annoys me

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
because Sorkin there is just basically

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
like you little nerds

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
he said in an interview

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
they said to him are you on Facebook

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
and he says no

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
isn't this fine having a conversation

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
isn't that everyone gets interviewed

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
by journalists

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
and you see it as well

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
comedians making fun of it

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
not everyone's got a microphone

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
in their hands

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
and it's this kind of jealousy

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
of wanting to preserve the stage

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
to yourself because you're a writer

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
it used to be that when Aaron Sorkin

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
opened his mouth everybody would listen

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
and no one would be able to talk back to him

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
he hates that people can talk back to him

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
is that

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
the part of me that overlaps

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
with Aaron Sorkin thinks that probably

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
another thing he hates because before he hated it

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
he had some dalliances

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
he had a couple

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
like I did when I got

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
rehired for the fifth season of Community

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I was on a high and I wanted to have a conversation

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
with people

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I felt good about myself again and within

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
three conversation threads

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I created four TMZ headlines

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
and then I

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
recoiled and I was like well Reddit is

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
I could easily said well Reddit is stupid

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
what I instead

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
said I probably say that all the time

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
but what the

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
reality is

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Reddit is not for me

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
right now until I am back to being

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
a

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
conversant on equal ground

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
there's weird things out there

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
the whole hashtag outrage thing

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
is so annoying and

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I agree with Pat in Oslo

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
that it's dangerous

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
for comedians because you have to watch yourself

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
so carefully

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Twitter is not a good place to develop material

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
let's put it that way

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Graham do you engage with your detractors

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
or do you go back and forth

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
or do you leave them? No I block them

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I love the mute button that's my favorite thing

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
The mute is pretty great but if they talk directly to you

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
it just goes right to you

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
we were talking about this the other day

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
No once I mute them

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
they are gone I never hear from them again

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
But if they say to you if they say at Glinner

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
No

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
I can never get this straight

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Does anyone have this straight in their head?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
No and I like to ask them a question

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
just before I mute them

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I like to say something

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
What makes you think that?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
If that's really what

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
mute is and I'm muting everybody

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I could swear I think that mute only

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
works with people that are like

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
hey I'm live tweeting the Super Bowl

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
and it's like I love you to death

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
but don't live tweet the Super Bowl

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
and you mute them because they're not talking to you

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
but if they were to say

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I love that touch down

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
reminds me of Dan Harmon

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
it'll override the mute

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Maybe it does work like that

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
and it's just that no one has replied to me

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
after I muted them

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
The only people

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
most of the people that I want to mute

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
we're talking about people that are talking

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
directly to me

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I only mute rude people

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
or people who say something that's just so dumb

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
or one guy like today who said

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I said does anyone know

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
any good places to eat in Los Angeles

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
or something and he replied no

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
and he was like bye bye

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Too snarky, too cynical

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
there must be a good place to grab a dibble

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
I tell you another thing

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
about the internet and I'm not sure if it's a good thing

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
or a bad thing, I was thinking about this today

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
is that it seems to me that

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
you've got the high level sociopaths

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
who are burying people

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
in shallow graves

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
and then you've got kind of lower level

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
who never really had a way of expressing themselves

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
till now

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
and it's these lower level sociopaths

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
who are like the whole gamergate thing

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
at the moment

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
there was a discussion on one

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
8chan or 4chan

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
one of these things

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
where they were seriously discussing

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
how they could make transsexuals

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
kill themselves

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
and they were saying this is operation

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
everything's an operation

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
this is operation juneberg or something

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
we'll send them this

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
and there's a list of links of photographs

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
to send transsexuals

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
there's a bunch of zodiac killers who didn't kill people

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
they just like writing the letters

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
exactly

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
yeah

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
who is the bully

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
that's the dangerous thing that's happened

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
is like

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
I got bullied

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
you can become

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
a kind of person that's like

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I've felt that way so often

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I've been in crowded restaurants

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
and

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
I've thought you know what

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I'm feeling the exact same feelings right now

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
that a supervillain feels

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I would really like to blow this place up

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I would really like to

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
not hurt but just kill so many people

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I would never

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
have to go to a store and buy a red wire

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
and a blue wire which as far as I understand

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
is how you make a bomb

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
you didn't hear that here

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I would go like

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
it's just too hard

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
not too hard but also I'm not going to do it

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I know it's actually very responsible because

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I can't handle it when someone calls me an asshole on Twitter

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I don't want to see their body blow up

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
maybe that's good for your low level

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
aspiring

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
high level sociopath

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
they're getting it out of their system maybe

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
they're playing in a sandbox

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
adolescence I mean that's what

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
an adolescent does

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
your body they don't like to hear this

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
I didn't like to hear this when I was an adolescent

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
no one liked to hear that your personality

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
is based on blood chemistry

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
but you are fucking

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
full of testosterone

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
don't you lose empathy for a while

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
when you're a teenager

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
two years you lose empathy

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
and the parts of your brain that are lighting up

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
the primate brain as it's going through puberty

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
the male primate brain

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
the violence and the sex

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
sections are overlapping

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I'm speaking really scientifically right now

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
you gotta look it up

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
but you are

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
I feel comfortable saying this

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
because we've been there

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
we were all adolescent boys

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
all of us

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
the three of us at least

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
and you remember

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
the amount of

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
control you had over

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
what your ideas really were

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
you had no real

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
you were a puppet

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
of

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
what a serial killer's

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
testimony might call the dog next door

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
you were

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
answering to a lower or higher calling

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
you were all

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
horned dog like weird

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
and it's not just about sex

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
it's not just about the fact that your dick is

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
like a little wood paneling nail

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
it's the whole time

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
no matter how much you rub it

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
the

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
what goes with that is

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
your feelings about

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Dan Chogram

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
were you doing like a call out

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
like how you rub it

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
is it

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
like the end of a commercial

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
how you rub it

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
no no I was like oh you rub it

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
oh you rub it

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
yes you rub it

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
after 30 it makes it go down

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
but tell

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
anybody's guess

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
then you start to take the pills to keep it up

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
the

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
personality that comes along with that

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
you're constantly like the kids

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
they do fucked up shit like kids left unchecked

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
they're

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I think gamer gay is mostly kids

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
of course it is

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
you're watching am I going to get fucking

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
egged

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
am I going to get my fucking social security number

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Sony already

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
made sure that's going to happen

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Graham what years

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
are there certain years that teenagers lose their empathy

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I don't know I read it somewhere

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
again not very scientific

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
did you go through a phase

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I know I did I went through like

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I never thought of it like that but did you go through a phase

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
where you went through it

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I did that thing where you care less

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
about the people you love for a bit

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
but I was just so wrapped up

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
in my own unhappiness

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
that you know

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
what town are you from

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Dublin

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I had a roommate that was from Dublin

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
and he got his ass kicked daily

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
is that why you saw Father Ted

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
no my friends that

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
turn me on to are all Americans

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
but they all love

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
like British TV and stuff

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Irish TV

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
my friend

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
just like

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
describing being

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
a preteen and a teenager

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
in Dublin was just a daily

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
deciding do I run home

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
and get beat up by my father or do I turn and fight

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
and fight like 40 people

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
my mum you said I never really

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
I never got that too bad it was all psychological

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
torture but

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
I used to be my mum

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
was always just full of stories about some kid

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
who would just walk home and just get

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
the shit kicked out of him for no reason

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
so yeah it was a bit

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
fearful you know it's weird though

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Ireland this is Ireland in the

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
you know 70s and 80s you know

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
I was just saying the whole

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
that's the thing about now is pornography

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
is pornography a good thing

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
it's still a thing

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
do you still

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
rub it in Ireland

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
but in Ireland

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
when you're going through that crazy

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
insane time

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
before the internet and in a Catholic

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
country you had to hump a pillow

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
there were photography magazines

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
and there was

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
a magazine called H&E

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
which stood for health and efficiency

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
and it was a nudist magazine

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
that somehow got through the censorship

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
by being about

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
the nudism which was a hobby

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
and it was always a really good looking

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
medical

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
but there was always a really good looking woman

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
on the cover and you'd wonder over

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
and pretend to be looking at other things for a while

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
and then you'd just kind of reach up

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
and take it down and open it up

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
and everything was like old men

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
and little kids holding hands

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
but the cover was always

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
beautiful don't rub it

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I'm a pretty firm believer

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
that the mitigation of resources

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
available to you in that state

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
are not you know you can't

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
farm that field

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
to control

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
the crop

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
you mean you'll always see weird

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
stuff that you don't want to see

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
you'd masturbate to a piece of driftwood

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
you gotta be kidding me

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
you live by the sea

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
the content that they're showing you

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
it's like oh this is for kids

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
but it's like yeah but that's still

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
round

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I remember

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
being this age but I did want to say

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
one thing about that because it's like

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Gamergate as relates to

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
adolescent like uncontrollable

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
rage

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
and it's unrefined

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
and it's like we have

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
in America at least I don't know how it works

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
in Europe but we have

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
we love our infantilization

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
we love taking away ritual

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
we love taking away

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
the things that used to

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
mean something in a tribal society

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
they have been systematically probably

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
usually for good reasons

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
vilified and taken away and put in a bin

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
because it's like are you kidding me this notion

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
that a father and a son

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
are more important than the government

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
that's fucking crazy and it's like

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
everyone kind of grows up

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
children and our children

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
in this childish country are like

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
they're particularly vulnerable

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
they're 14 years old and they're fucking on fire

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
every cell in their body

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
is on fire and

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
they do some cool shit sometimes

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
the Mountain Dew campaign

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
where they

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
asked everybody to vote for a new flavor

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
of Mountain Dew you get to name

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
our new flavor and I got all

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
sensitivity to

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
anybody that would be offended by this aside

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
please recognize the artistic integrity of this

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
in the face of corporate

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
oligarchy

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
the 4chan kids

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
ganged up and so they just flood this thing

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
and the new Mountain Dew flavor

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
they had to cancel it because the new Mountain Dew flavor

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
was going to be called

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Hitler did nothing wrong

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
for real?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
and it's like yeah

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
fucking take that

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
how do they promote that

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
this is all about coordinated strikes

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
this is people who live online

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
and who understand that world

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
we're in water world and they're all

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Kevin Costner

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
they have the gills

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
they dive down they can drink their own pee

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
and they can breathe underwater

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
and the shame about it

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
is that they don't use their powers for good

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I think sometimes do

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
sorry

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
again with all due deference

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
to anybody who was murdered

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
by Hitler or anything like that

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
that is an example

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
of actually kind of in my opinion

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
it's anti-corporate

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
anti-establishment energy

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
and it's fun

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
and it causes you to laugh

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
and that's good

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
you wouldn't do that if you were 25

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
you wouldn't do that if you were 35

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
it takes a bunch of 14 year olds

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
to do something like that

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
and you kind of look out your window at that line

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
and you go don't get off my lawn

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
that's pretty funny

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
I wonder what it tasted like

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
it was kind of like

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
kind of like raspberry

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
and then the great thing

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
was all the Photoshop images

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
what if they had let it through

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
what if they had been accountable to their own rules

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
and the storefronts would be filled

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
with these two liter bottles

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
and Hitler did nothing wrong

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
there's two old guys in an apportion

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
they've got their Iwo Jima hats on

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
and they're like it's pretty good

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
it's a hugely important thing

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
it's like what is that

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
this interactivity and oh it's a contest

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
and you get to help out and you're a consumer

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
and it's like fuck you

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
it's fucking beautiful

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
barf back along that food line

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
there's barf coming out of here

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
do you have a hamburger on Twitter

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
no no

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
he's so funny

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
he just finds every corporate account

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
and retweets it along with a comment

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
and he just ruins all these

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
competitions and stuff to have

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
do you remember any good ones

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
he retweets everyone who says Taco Bell made me puke

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
that's right

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
he'll just spend the whole evening doing

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
he's like 40 people every Monday

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
he's really good

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I think it was Ray Pruitt who's been

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
in the Harmontown before

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
he's my friend from Texas

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
he's kind of in a weird street theater

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
kind of organization

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
they do weird kind of guerrilla theater

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
like anti-comedy

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
kind of like situationist

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
pranks and stuff

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
actually it was

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
another friend of mine but it doesn't matter

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
there was a thing on the radio

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
the radio was a thing

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
or you could turn on a thing in your car

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
and there'd be music and news and stuff

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
he's like alright it's K-A-M-W-M

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
we're playing all Beatles all the time

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
and you all vote

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
your favorite Beatles song

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
we're going to play that same song

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
for 24 hours

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
so call in and they just got everybody

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
in Oklahoma to vote for Hey Bulldog

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
so

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
the guy's like alright it's uh

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
24 hours of Hey Bulldog

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
it's a Beatles song that you don't know Dan Harmon

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
it's not a bad song but nobody

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
wants 24 hours of it

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
the radio station stuck to their guns

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
and they played 24 fucking hours

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
of Hey Bulldog

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
and everybody else just danced to it and then they all got sick of it again

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
they were sad about it

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
oh shit

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
actually could you read that

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I just got new glasses

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
before because I'm getting old

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
you know and I need glasses now

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
so it's frightening because I do this

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
and it's like this is

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
everything's normal I do this

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
I'm gonna die

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I started thinking

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I just don't seem to be able to

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
read that

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
sign across the road or whatever so

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
it just got a bit but it's terrifying

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I do this and I get sad

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
let me see without the glasses

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
that's what you normally look like

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Jerry O'Connell

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
he's an American actor right take him off

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
a little bit

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I'll take that

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I'll take any actor over me

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
you ever see Jerry Maguire

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
he's the quarterback

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
he's Cuba Gooding's friend

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
what else is he in for

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Sliders

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
he should put him in an IT crap

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
yeah okay

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I'll be in it too

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
what was the Olive Garden tweet

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
no

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I don't have Adam Goldberg's thumb

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
sorry

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
can you remember what it said

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
that's Adam Goldberg

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Adam Goldberg is like our Gonzo

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
from my mother's show

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I'm what you'd call a backbencher

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
for us

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Olive Garden says

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
please in three words

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
name

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
what describes Italian food

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
and he said not Olive Garden

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
that's

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Adam Goldberg everybody

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Adam Goldberg

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
good to see Adam

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
there's a significant crisis here

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
without Spencer here

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
I like what's happening here

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
we're having an adult conversation

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
we're doing fine everything that's happening right now

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
is fine that sounds like I'm

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
protesting too much

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
we don't have

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
a show closer

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
have we ever had a show closer

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
we've never had a show closer

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
don't you play Dungeons & Dragons

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
it's a great way to show

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
we always did that

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I watched yours

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
before we did ours

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
did I write it before yours

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I thought you were before me

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
for some reason

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
grandpa

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
you just went into

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
one of my favorite things

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
what they do is when they get excited

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
they go Falsetto

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
what did you

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
I love that

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
did you follow me rainbow all the way here

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I have a particular set of skills

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I don't think that I'm not being

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
scared by this guy

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Liam Neeson and the phone

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
with his part of gold

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
in a few minutes

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
they're gonna take you

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
here's what you do

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
tell them they get three wishes

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I'm gonna grant them

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
but ironically

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I used to play

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
did you ever play Carla Cthulhu

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
no

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
you should get into that

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I'm having a

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I want to get into

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Lovecraft now

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
really late

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
I just bothered to ask the question

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
what is the deal with this Lovecraft shit

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
I find him really hard to read

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
I find him a bit boring

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
are we reading HP Lovecraft

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
or is there a game called Lovecraft

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
no there's a game called Falsetto based on

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
HP Lovecraft stories

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I was just talking about the whole milieu

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I think it's interesting that there was a guy

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
with people still to this day

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
it's easy to

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I've got other shit to do

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
the scariest take on Lovecraft

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
is actually Alan Moore's Lovecraft

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
comics has anyone ever read them

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Alan Moore wrote Lovecraft comics

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
he wrote two comics

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
that are just Lovecraft stories

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
and they're horrible

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
it's one of those things where

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
you're reading it

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
and halfway through you wish

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
you were reading it

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
you know the kind of Lovecraft

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
the universe right

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
you get a book and you open it

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
and you go, oh my god

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
maybe that's what it was going for

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Alan Moore is a genius right

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
no it's great but it's horribly great

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
it's so funny that Alan Moore

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
he's like a refined version of Stephen King

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
and so much of his shit

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
has been turned into bad shit

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
but unlike Stephen King

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
he's not cool with any of it

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Stephen King's like, maybe the shining was alright

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.120
I changed my mind.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.760
Yeah, I met him a few times, and I told him

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.800
I hadn't seen the Watchmen film, and he poked me.

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:49.240
He poked to say, you've got to get out there.

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.200
No, no, no, he's just very happy, very happy that I didn't

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.960
and wouldn't say it.

01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:55.240
I've got to watch this.

01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:57.280
There's a documentary in this very like gonzo,

01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:02.560
just like him talking like, I didn't really realize.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.480
Last year, I realized that Alan Moore was the common thread

01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:08.440
between so many things that were so culturally effective.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.520
I've got to get caught up on this guy.

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:11.280
He's great.

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:11.840
He's great.

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:14.480
What were you talking to him for?

01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:16.720
I went to a dinner, and he was invited, or no,

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.480
I was invited to meet him by a comic shop in London

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:23.400
called Gosh Comics, which is a great comic shop in London.

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.200
There's almost nothing you can say that someone

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.240
won't clap for it.

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.360
That was a pretty deep cut.

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:29.520
I'm from London.

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.440
Are you from London?

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.040
Oh, awesome.

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:36.840
And yeah, we just had a nice dinner.

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:43.520
How are you going to make IT crowd good for NBC with Neil

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.160
Goldman?

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.280
The thing is, they very kindly asked

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.600
me to come over after I kind of forced them to ask me,

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.200
because all I want to do is pitch my idea of what

01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.280
the show could be over here.

01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:01.360
And it would be unfair for me to say it out here

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.400
before I say it to them.

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.280
But I just think, I was thinking about studio sitcoms

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:10.360
in the States, and it seems to me there's only one show.

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:14.040
No, there's two shows that are like my show that

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.880
are in front of an audience in the States.

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.360
Married with children.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:19.000
Wow.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.400
Yeah, not like in terms of quality.

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:24.560
The quality was up and down, but it was the same kind of.

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.240
There was no quality.

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:28.160
No, did you ever see the episode where they all

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.720
had to get their hair cut at the Lady's Salon?

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:31.880
That's very funny.

01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:33.920
I think I saw every episode of that show,

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.120
but it was great about it.

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.040
It was like, you felt like you were watching

01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:38.880
a show that was made in someone's basement.

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:39.800
It was so crap.

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:40.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:44.040
But it's similar to my show in that it's kind of nuts

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.360
in the real world in some ways.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.080
It's kind of heightened.

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.240
That's what you're talking about.

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:49.360
You're talking about the relationship between reality.

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.880
Yeah, and the other one is soap.

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:51.360
Remember soap?

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.800
Yeah, yeah, yes.

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.760
Soap had that same kind of crazy.

01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.560
But I remember soap as a child, so I remember it

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.920
as a grown-up show, so I don't remember having mystical.

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:03.200
Yeah, the ventriloquist dummy, and all that sort of stuff.

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:06.200
So it was kind of crazy, and in later seasons,

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:09.640
they had aliens kidnapping the guy.

01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:10.840
So it got really insane.

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.240
So they're the only two shows that

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.600
seem to be kind of insane in the way that my stuff sometimes is.

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.080
So you're going to tell Bob Greenblatt,

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.400
I want it to be like soap again?

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:20.600
No, no, no.

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:21.560
The opposite.

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:22.640
The opposite.

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.520
I mean, again, I don't want to say too much,

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:28.080
but I'm going to say to try and pull back on all that stuff

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.680
and do what American shows do so well, character.

01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.480
And in terms of studio sitcoms, I'm

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:38.720
thinking in terms of things like Cheers and Seinfeld, which

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.560
I've said it before, but IT Crowd is just

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:44.680
me trying to copy Seinfeld and getting it wrong.

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:47.840
I just worshiped that show.

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.520
Those were some of the happiest years of my life watching

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:52.040
Seinfeld with Bob.

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:54.560
I got caught up with it in syndication,

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:58.080
and I didn't really realize the extent to which I was ripping

01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:00.800
it off until I observed other sitcoms

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.000
and how structurally they were different from community.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.760
But I thought that I was doing Star Trek

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.000
because the bridge of the enterprise

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:09.800
was so necessary.

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:12.280
So the study room was like the bridge of the enterprise.

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:14.480
But it was really like that was Seinfeld's kitchen.

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:17.280
And so you go A story, B story, and then they split off,

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:20.280
and then they reconvene in an ideal community episode,

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.680
which there are so few of.

01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:24.200
They always go astray.

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:28.480
But yeah, it's like you have everybody coming in

01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:30.680
and going, I have this problem, I have that problem,

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:33.720
and then they split off into these crazy things.

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.440
And that wonderful thing that Seinfeld would often do,

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:39.720
where you just did not know how they were going

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:42.600
to connect the two storylines until a second before it

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:47.560
happens, and then you'd get this little explosion of joy

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.120
when you realized.

01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:52.440
I mean, one example, that's kind of not an example,

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.880
because it was slightly forced, but still great,

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:57.800
is Kramer being mistaken for someone

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:02.240
who's got mental problems and ends up singing to Mel Torme.

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:04.440
No, no, Mel Torme ends up singing to him.

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:05.200
Have you not seen that?

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:05.840
Yeah, I don't remember.

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.280
Oh my god, it's so funny.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:10.440
And it's one of those laughs that you think

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.680
you will never stop laughing at one point.

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:16.680
It's just beautiful, because he's just got

01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:19.480
an overcane in his mouth.

01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:21.480
And he's kind of like.

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.960
What do you think of the office?

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:24.280
What do you think of the UK office?

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.880
What do you think of the American office?

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.320
No offense to anyone working on it,

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:30.040
but I find the American one hard to watch,

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:34.080
because I really love that first series of the office.

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:39.000
And I just find it odd that it's exactly the same relationships.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.520
And I know they moved off it later on,

01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:44.280
but I don't know, I find it a little bit hard to watch.

01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.200
But true, no fault of the show.

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:47.200
I know it's a good show.

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:50.520
But you thought the UK one was like.

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.520
I think that first series is mind blowing.

01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:55.080
You don't have Gervais fatigue, which

01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.480
I have been told is a thing in England?

01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.320
No, OK.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:58.760
I'm kidding.

01:42:58.760 --> 01:42:59.360
I made that up.

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.120
We were really.

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.280
We used to, I used to know him.

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.280
And then he slagged off the IT crowd on his blog.

01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:05.880
And I was like, oh.

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:06.280
What?

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:07.480
Yeah, yeah, it's like, oh.

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:11.560
I don't know when we fell out, but apparently that's

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.880
the thing that friends now do to each other, isn't it?

01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:17.280
Wait, I'm deadly curious about this.

01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:21.440
How does Ricky Gervais make the time to articulate a slag?

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.760
He said, we got nominated for an award and he said,

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:28.840
best of a bad lot.

01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:32.520
I don't even know if that's so British I'm like.

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:35.520
Of these bad things, it's probably the best.

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:36.480
It was the least shitty.

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:37.880
Yeah, it was the least shitty.

01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.480
Oh, was he hosting?

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:40.080
No, no, no.

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:41.200
He was just writing about it.

01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.200
Oh.

01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:43.600
He took time out of his day.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:46.520
Fuck you, Gervais.

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:47.880
Graham, I'm going to go on record and sing

01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.440
I Never Like Ricky Gervais.

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:53.240
Let's get him.

01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:53.840
All right.

01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:59.320
Well, I was curious, it's the Bell Tolls for us.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.440
We don't have Spencer.

01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:01.400
I'm addicted to bringing Spencer.

01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:02.520
Graham, you don't know about this,

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:03.800
but this is the point in the show.

01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:06.040
We try to crudely shoehorn in an ending

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.000
to our unstructured show.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:08.440
OK.

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.840
So it gets a little awkward.

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:12.360
And then the first funny thing I hear,

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:14.960
I play a loud musical sting to it.

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:17.120
And then we get the fuck out of here.

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:18.040
OK.

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.160
Shit, I don't know.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:20.000
Dan, you want to?

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:20.800
Don't force it.

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:21.800
Don't force it.

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:24.280
Let's just, now we just take a couple breaths.

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:35.400
We're all going to die.

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:39.000
Shit.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
I thought that was going to happen.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:50.480
Let's just embrace the sadness of this song.

01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:59.000
If you've got everyone to sing.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.280
Dan and I have kind of a Christmas tradition,

01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:05.760
where one year we got together and we changed the lyrics

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.880
to this song.

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:09.000
It goes like this, Graham.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.480
Dicks and balls and beer.

01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:17.480
Dicks and balls and beer.

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.480
It's an Irish song.

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.480
The fire is warm.

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.960
It's a perfect storm.

01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:25.960
It's dicks and balls and beer.

01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:32.560
It's not enough.

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:35.280
They deserve better.

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:38.600
They deserve, is there an Irish Christmas tradition, Graham?

01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.600
You want to share it with us, isn't it?

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:45.600
We celebrate Bill O'Reilly leaving.

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:49.600
We celebrate Bill O'Reilly's family being driven out.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.600
Is he from Ireland?

01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.600
No, no.

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.600
Just by name.

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.600
This game just sounds too Irish.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.600
No, he's Irish descent, though, isn't he?

01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.600
Irish descent.

01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:59.600
Yeah.

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:01.600
Is there a word on the street about like,

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.600
do people just, people hate Bill O'Reilly?

01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:04.600
No, no, they don't know who he is.

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:05.600
They don't know who he is.

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:06.600
They don't know who he is.

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.600
They come back and do TV shows in Ireland

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.600
and pretend to be a normal human being.

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.600
They let him away with it because no one really watches TV.

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:16.600
When people in, there's a...

01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:17.600
No, sorry, people watch TV in Ireland.

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:19.600
Sorry, that's not what I meant.

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:22.600
This guy, Flanagan, who runs this venue here in LA,

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.600
he's very Irish and he's very LA,

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:30.600
and he was explaining to me that he said this.

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:33.600
Now, like, I'm submitting this to you.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.600
I want to, yes or no, he said...

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:36.600
He vaguely writes this.

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.600
The Irish in Ireland, they actually,

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.600
contrary to what you might think,

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:50.600
they're not repulsed by the millions of Irish-American tourists

01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:53.600
that flood to the homeland every year.

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.600
They're kind of, they kind of like it

01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:01.600
because the actual Irish represent like a certain amount

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.600
and like the idea that seed was spread,

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:06.600
no matter how fat and gross these people are,

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:09.600
that come back and buy these like key chains

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.600
and refrigerator magnets.

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.600
I don't know, I'd never really...

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:17.600
In Dublin, you might not see it as much as kind of...

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.600
Because, you know, people get to Dublin and they're annoyed

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:21.600
because there's a gap, you know,

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:25.600
and there's kind of, there's no Irish fiddlers on the street.

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:27.600
But you go out into the countryside and there's a lot more...

01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.600
Is nobody selling cockles and mussels?

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:31.600
Yeah, no, you don't really get that anymore, you know.

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:33.600
The cockles and mussels business has dried up.

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.600
It's just a shame.

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:37.600
Yeah, but no, Dublin, when I grew up in Dublin,

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:39.600
it used to really annoy me any representation of Ireland

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.600
that involved fiddles or people going,

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.600
oh, you know, because, you know...

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:51.600
I was in New York and Chicago celebrate St. Patrick's,

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.600
I think probably more than Ireland does.

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.600
Yeah, no, no, I mean, believe me,

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.600
the St. Patrick's Day celebrations in New York

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:01.600
are the funniest thing to Irish people.

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:04.600
They are just so ridiculous

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:07.600
and these kind of awful men

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:11.600
turning their back on the gay Irish coming by,

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.600
all that sort of stuff.

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:16.600
There's a pub in Hell's Kitchen, I think,

01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:19.600
and it's an Irish pub, and they have this big sign.

01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:21.600
I was there once with St. Patrick's Day,

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.600
I wasn't there during it, but it was the day before,

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.600
two days before, and there was a big sign,

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:28.600
like, big block letters that said,

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:31.600
don't sing Danny Boy. It's not an Irish song.

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:33.600
It was written by an English person.

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.600
Like, if you fucking sing Danny Boy, we're throwing you out.

01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.600
That sounds like a great bar.

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:39.600
That's really what I go to.

01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.600
But I heard a great story from a band called,

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.600
a Northern Irish band called Therapy,

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.600
who were on tour with House of Pain.

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:50.600
Remember, House of Pain, Jump Around?

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:51.600
And House of Pain...

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.600
We could forget.

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:53.600
Yeah, but they were in...

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.600
House of Pain was Jump Around?

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.600
Yeah, wasn't it?

01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:00.600
But House of Pain, they were in Dublin,

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:02.600
and Therapy were in their dressing room,

01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:04.600
and one of House of Pain's took their head in and said,

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:06.600
hey, guys, come with us.

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.600
We found this great Irish bar!

01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:12.600
In Ireland?

01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:13.600
Yeah, really?

01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:16.600
But I think they meant a bar that had a shamrock in it,

01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:18.600
or something, you know?

01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:20.600
Every other bar wasn't an Irish bar.

01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:23.600
It probably had a Celtics jersey in there, so I'm sorry.

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:24.600
Is there a...?

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:26.600
Shit, I was hoping that would be it.

01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:27.600
I know.

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:28.600
This is when we start scrambling.

01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:30.600
It's every man for himself right now.

01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:32.600
But is there...?

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.600
I mean, the answer is no.

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:37.600
I'm wondering what...

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:42.600
I'm not wondering what three intellectuals in London

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:46.600
having a drink at a bar say about American culture,

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:50.600
but I am very much wondering what three Irish...

01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.600
I'll tell you, we used to love the regulars in our bar.

01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.600
We used to go to this pub in Dublin

01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.600
called The International, me and Arthur.

01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.600
And there were always some really funny guys there,

01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:05.600
and they'd just be watching the TV.

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.600
They were there every day.

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.600
And 9-Eleven happened, you know?

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.600
And this guy was...

01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:13.600
Here comes our closer.

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:14.600
Yeah, we got our closer.

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:15.600
Come in.

01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:16.600
Buckle up, everybody.

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:18.600
And this...

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:21.600
If it doesn't have the power to close a show,

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.600
then I question its status as a national tragedy.

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.600
I actually...

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:27.600
I say that on record.

01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:29.600
Well, no, so basically,

01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:32.600
Bin Laden, you know, was trying...

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:35.600
His name was starting to be floated about because of it, you know?

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.600
And this guy was looking up at the TV,

01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:38.600
and you see the towers burning,

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:40.600
and then you see a picture of Bin Laden.

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:41.600
And this guy at the bar said,

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:44.600
there he is, the man of the moment.

01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:49.600
That's how it's done, everybody.

01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:51.600
Thank you for coming.

01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.600
And...

01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:55.600
I am a drink.

01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.600
He should be a guest

01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.600
in our country

01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:00.600
until he leaves.

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:02.600
He's a genius.

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:04.600
Thank you, Jeff, for coming back.

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:05.600
We missed you.

01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.600
Thank you for having me back.

01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:10.600
Thank you for Cali Funtech.

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.600
You ever coming up and saying hi?

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:16.600
See you soon.

01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:18.600
Go ahead and sit down.

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:21.600
Come on in, everyone.

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:23.600
There's Zach in the back.

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:24.600
Justin Marshall, of course,

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:26.600
always producing our lovely stuff.

01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:28.600
There's also Chris and his girlfriend.

01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:31.600
She probably doesn't want to be identified as his girlfriend.

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:33.600
There's two people in the back

01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:36.600
that are also responsible for video production,

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:38.600
who also need to be thanked.

01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:41.600
I want to thank Rutger and Zippo,

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:45.600
the charming velociraptors.

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:47.600
All right, I'll drive fast and take chances.

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:48.600
Thanks for coming.

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:50.600
Kris Boruff and Sarah Hill.

01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:52.600
They're helping us out back there,

01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:53.600
bringing video to you.

01:51:53.600 --> 01:52:18.600
We'll see you next week.
