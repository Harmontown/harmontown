00:00.000 --> 00:25.000
I call this Harmontown to order. Ladies and gentlemen, how are you doing tonight? Fantastic.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.720
Welcome to the Nerdist Theater in downtown Hollywood, California. Thank you, loyal Armenians

00:29.720 --> 00:33.720
for being here at the Nerdmelt Nerdist Theater. And thank you for listening in Podcast Land.

00:33.720 --> 00:38.360
Ladies and gentlemen, the last week we tabled the issue of child abuse and peeing in your pants.

00:38.360 --> 00:44.240
Tonight's topic, we tend to discuss technology. Please put your hands together for the mayor

00:44.240 --> 01:01.400
of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon. Thank you. You're very kind. You're good people. Very excited.

01:01.400 --> 01:07.240
I'm in a very good mood tonight. Why is that? I'm writing two TV pilots for networks that were

01:07.240 --> 01:18.320
kicking my ass on the ratings when I was at NBC. It's very satisfying. For three years,

01:18.320 --> 01:28.160
I was told, get higher ratings. I figured out how. I know exactly how I'm going to do it.

01:28.160 --> 01:40.480
I'm going to go to the networks that have higher ratings. I feel good about my decision. I'm

01:40.480 --> 01:48.080
a smirky, smug, self-satisfied, third act of a rom-com kind of mood. I just feel like I'm in

01:48.080 --> 01:53.760
the middle of a montage where there's dissolving charts that are going up and Casey Kasem's

01:53.760 --> 02:02.640
mentioning me and Sigourney Weaver seeing my ad on TV and changing her mind about my wacky ways.

02:02.640 --> 02:10.520
Things are moving up for Old Man Ghostbuster. That's the reference I was making. You 25-year-old

02:10.520 --> 02:17.200
fucks. Sorry, that's a trademark of the show. I get angry at you for being young. But I'm not

02:17.200 --> 02:24.600
in a get-off-my-lawn mood. I'm in a get-on-my-lawn mood. Get on my lawn, you fuckers. Let's party

02:24.600 --> 02:34.040
down like we're at a Yanni concert. There was a guy named Yanni. You young fucks. You are in a

02:34.040 --> 02:41.560
get-off-my-lawn mood. Deep down, you are. Nah, nah. I love you, kids. I love you so much. I'm

02:41.560 --> 02:49.080
going to write a pilot for CBS. That's how much I love you. That's a weird reaction.

02:49.080 --> 02:56.160
Now, if I were you guys, I see that the tweeters that are coming back at me in the comment sections

02:56.160 --> 03:02.280
under the press releases are like, well, that sucks. Because it's like, oh, he's selling out. Yeah,

03:02.280 --> 03:10.920
maybe. I might. For like six months, I might give that a taste. I might kick back in a hammock a

03:10.920 --> 03:16.720
little bit and get out of Hanna-Barbera remote-controlled lawnmower, sip out of a coconut.

03:16.720 --> 03:23.040
I was told not to work so hard for three years. I'm going to put that theory to the test, see

03:23.040 --> 03:32.000
what kind of TV that generates. Do you have any ideas? No, sir, no. No. My idea is to write

03:32.000 --> 03:38.240
mainstream television. I mean, at some point, though, you're going to have to... Nope. No. No,

03:38.240 --> 03:44.120
because if I said... If I first meeting at one of these places, if I say, I have this idea,

03:44.120 --> 03:50.120
there are these firefighters. They're kind of an unlikely family, but when you join the fire

03:50.120 --> 03:53.720
department, you're forced to work with other people. Maybe you don't like them so much.

03:53.720 --> 03:58.120
Sounds like you do have an idea. No, I'm saying if I said this, if this was my idea, I don't know.

03:58.120 --> 04:03.160
The first thing they're going to say is, I love it, and the second thing they're going to say is,

04:03.160 --> 04:12.040
could the firefighters be police? And if I'm really, like, jazzed about the firefighter idea,

04:12.040 --> 04:15.880
then I'm going to go, I don't know. I think I should be a firefighter. And they're going to go,

04:15.880 --> 04:24.720
hmm, difficult. But if I don't care, then I'm going to say, yes, they should be police. You're

04:24.720 --> 04:31.240
brilliant. They should be police. They only want one thing. They want you to do a good job

04:31.240 --> 04:37.480
executing the show. The idea is not like, no, I would be, I would be doing a disservice to

04:37.480 --> 04:42.640
television, sir, if I had an idea already before I even sit down with these people about what these

04:42.640 --> 04:47.360
shows are going to be about. They're going to be about pickle farmers. They're going to, I changed

04:47.360 --> 04:52.600
my mind, they're going to be about rollerbladers. No, no, you know what? Fuck rollerbladers. They're

04:52.600 --> 05:00.720
going to be about human spiders. Unless that's not what they want. I want to see the human spider

05:00.720 --> 05:10.040
show. It's weird because they're human, but they're spiders. There's going to be some very,

05:10.040 --> 05:18.160
very funny situations that arise from that. You should call it a spider man. No, all right. I like

05:18.160 --> 05:26.200
it. Spider human. Yeah, Joel, cheers wasn't an idea. That's a, that's a bar. That's what I mean. I

05:26.200 --> 05:32.560
mean, do you, do you have your, is it a taxi stand? Why not let them handle that? Why is that the

05:32.560 --> 05:38.880
heart, why not let them say, you know what's hot these days? Slinkies. Hey, you're right. Slinkies

05:38.880 --> 05:42.320
with two E's and a Z. That sounds like a good idea. Now I'm making it sound like I'm going to

05:42.320 --> 05:45.720
write something dumb. That's not the point. The point is I'm going to go, I'm going to hoist my

05:45.720 --> 05:51.960
sails to the wind that's there. Unfortunately, I furnished the rumor mill with a lot of rumors

05:51.960 --> 05:58.000
about what a shitty boss I was. I don't, I don't, no, I haven't seen any official like accounts of

05:58.000 --> 06:02.240
how bad I was. Do you think that you were a shitty boss though, like by your own standards? Well,

06:02.240 --> 06:06.360
no, not by my own standards, but the problem is it's an elitist industry. So certainly by the

06:06.360 --> 06:11.240
standards of the poor fucker that has to haul a cable down on the set, who's, who would have to

06:11.240 --> 06:16.600
haul it, you know, who, like his job is harder. The more I, the more time I take with a script or

06:16.600 --> 06:20.800
something like that. So yeah, by his standards, by, by anybody's standards, who's like, who would

06:20.800 --> 06:26.640
prefer the schedule work better? You know, yeah, I'm a shitty boss because the, because I take my

06:26.640 --> 06:32.480
tells my work too seriously. Do you think that you can easily slip from single camera, half hour

06:32.480 --> 06:41.640
into a multi camera? No sweat, buddy. Here's the thing, more cameras. It's like, it's like even

06:41.640 --> 06:47.080
baseball, you give you can have two bats in your hands. But that's more cable for more sorry fuckers.

06:47.080 --> 06:53.400
Yeah, but they're going to get home by five N word because it, because you're gonna, you know,

06:53.400 --> 06:57.640
it's you're putting on a little play every week. You can't just say N word, but you know, I think

06:57.640 --> 07:03.320
that you're not the people don't know what I mean. They know what you just called me. Yeah, but the

07:03.320 --> 07:07.680
point, the point of the N word is not the actual, the word isn't like abracadabra that actually

07:07.680 --> 07:14.200
cast a magic spell. Can you feel all the eyes burning the back of your head? Our ambassador,

07:14.200 --> 07:19.160
African American in the front row. Yeah. The only two black people in the building are seated in

07:19.160 --> 07:23.000
the front row right now. You're so lucky you sat in the front row because if you were in the back

07:23.000 --> 07:31.360
or like turning, turning, but, but I said, no, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm right on this one. I don't

07:31.360 --> 07:36.800
mind like you say the word N word, you mean two things. You know what I mean, culturally, but

07:36.800 --> 07:42.360
also if I'm saying it instead of actually saying it, what it means is I respect the idea that it's

07:42.360 --> 07:46.800
the, that the word is an insult. You know what I mean? Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah, because

07:46.800 --> 07:51.440
the word, don't ask me, ask him. The word is it. Well, I'm not going to ask, I'm also, he's not,

07:51.440 --> 08:00.800
he doesn't get to answer for the whole race. That's racism. Fuck him or, or I love you. I don't

08:00.800 --> 08:07.200
know. It depends on you. Your individual performance as a human being. That's non-racism is

08:07.200 --> 08:16.200
when we don't know from, like, like, we don't think that he's talking, that he's not the Borg. The,

08:16.200 --> 08:24.560
the, but I, like, I, I, I, the problem is the intent behind the word language doesn't, the English

08:24.560 --> 08:28.800
language is a bunch of sounds that we make. Do you know, like, I went to Montreal, there's a

08:28.800 --> 08:35.320
bunch of stores there called Couche Tard. To them, it means, I don't know, big savings or

08:35.320 --> 08:40.040
something. I don't know. My sister's retarded. She wouldn't like it. Well, she wouldn't know, but,

08:40.040 --> 08:48.200
but Couche Tard is offensive over here to both tards and couches. What's a couche? I don't, well,

08:48.200 --> 08:54.360
it's, you know, it's what your Scottish friend would call a wizard. We just found out, we have a

08:54.360 --> 09:00.720
Scottish friend, we just found out that a slang term for vagina is wizard sleeve. Wizard sleeve. I

09:00.720 --> 09:06.400
thought she said wizard. I was like, that's the first great word for a vagina, like a first, like,

09:06.400 --> 09:14.000
that's so respectful. I was like, like, like this, this oracle of, like, you're going to it for

09:14.000 --> 09:20.120
instruction and enchantment. But, but it, but to me, to me, like, I mean, men are visual thinkers.

09:20.120 --> 09:26.280
It conjures up a wizened old dude with a, with a beard on a robe. That makes you a hero. I, like,

09:26.280 --> 09:29.800
that tells you when you're doing it right, when you're doing it wrong. That has all the power. I,

09:29.800 --> 09:37.000
I, I am calling Pussy's wizards from now on. I think that's fucking beautiful. I, I, sleeve is

09:37.000 --> 09:44.520
gross. Like, envelope, wallet, any object, like, a sheath. Yeah, obviously, what you're saying is

09:44.520 --> 09:50.400
it's an object and that's no good. I, we stumbled onto it on accident. Call it a wizard. And if

09:50.400 --> 09:57.560
it's really fucking nice and you really love the woman, call it Merlin. Man, I was with Tabitha

09:57.560 --> 10:03.720
the last night. She's got a fucking straight up Merlin, bro. Man, but I was out with, I was out

10:03.720 --> 10:12.280
with Tabitha and she's got a Voldemort man. Right? Was that a wizard? I don't know. Yeah, but I think

10:12.280 --> 10:16.960
a good one, isn't it? I don't know. It's a Voldemort good or bad. He's bad. Okay. A guy, a guy went

10:16.960 --> 10:22.200
like this, he gave a thumbs down. This was being shot like a multi-camera thing, like with the

10:22.200 --> 10:26.160
audience, like, if it was like, who's lying to them, they would use you. They would cut you would

10:26.160 --> 10:31.640
be on TV because you gave a thumbs down and he said, it's bad. Voldemort's bad. The editors would

10:31.640 --> 10:36.200
be like, oh, I like him. I like him. See, I thought he was giving me the thumbs down because that

10:36.200 --> 10:41.480
was not a funny enough reference. No, no, no, he's just fucking immersed. Voldemort's bad. The price

10:41.480 --> 10:47.880
is right. Is there a funnier bad wizard than Voldemort? It has to be. Who else is a bad wizard?

10:47.880 --> 10:58.560
Zoran is good. Zoran. Zoran, the gay wizard. The gay wand. Anyways, I think that's beautiful. The

10:58.560 --> 11:05.080
wizard. The wizard. Baby, I'm going to go to town on your wizard tonight. I want to have sex more

11:05.080 --> 11:11.520
than I did before. I want to talk about the wizard. I want to see your wizard. I want to go to your

11:11.520 --> 11:18.120
wizard. I want to become a hero. Anyways, so I don't know if it's worth getting back to the n-word

11:18.120 --> 11:23.080
root of that tangent, but... Oh, it's worth it. The English language, like any language, is just a

11:23.080 --> 11:29.880
bunch of sounds we make to make ourselves clear. The intent behind the words we use, and it's a

11:29.880 --> 11:34.800
beautiful thing that we're able to discern intent from language. That's the miracle. It's the intent

11:34.800 --> 11:40.920
that you want to police. You want to know whether or not someone is actually racist, not whether

11:40.920 --> 11:46.440
they said a combination of words that's technically racist. When you fall into that game, guess who's

11:46.440 --> 11:52.160
really good at it? A bunch of fucking lying, shitty, racist fuckers. That's who's really good at it.

11:52.160 --> 11:58.920
Like, look how many... As soon as they caught on to the idea that we were figuring out that bad

11:58.920 --> 12:06.400
people are racist, like all genuinely racist, shitty, evil people do is they just put Condoleezza

12:06.400 --> 12:11.080
Rice next to them, and they go like, this makes me a good person, right? According to your definition,

12:11.080 --> 12:16.440
don't give them that power by like being hung up on technicalities. The idea of non-racism is that

12:16.440 --> 12:22.640
the race doesn't matter, period, doesn't matter. Is that dumb tangent? Now I've turned into Lenny

12:22.640 --> 12:33.760
Bruce. Anyways, I like to... I say n-word, you know what I mean. Dan and I, we don't do it as much as

12:33.760 --> 12:40.000
we used to, but lots of times at parties, via Dan's or my place or someone else's place, we would

12:40.000 --> 12:45.640
start freestyle rapping. You know, like some white dudes just freestyle rapping, and you know, we do

12:45.640 --> 12:51.240
improv, so we kind of fancy ourselves, you know, good to varying degrees. Yeah, it's hard to do

12:51.240 --> 12:58.640
freestyle rap without... You don't say n-word then, you use the n-word. And that's always when

12:58.640 --> 13:05.200
demorts would walk by. You use the n-word, like people put pepper on their salad. I fucking love

13:05.200 --> 13:13.480
it. And rap, that word is fucking delicious. It's like fucking licorice. We're kind of licorice.

13:13.480 --> 13:22.240
N-word-ish licorice. If I was able to say it, there'd be a fucking awesome rhyme. We read some

13:22.240 --> 13:29.240
part of it, and we're all going around in a circle, like, okay, it's talking about bacon bits. Bacon bits, rap. Yeah.

13:29.240 --> 13:35.240
It's salty and brown, and you go, I want it around, put it on your salad, and n-word makes it... I don't know.

13:35.240 --> 13:44.720
It's just fun, it's fucking, it's a go-to. It's like popping the plastic bubbles in the packing. If you're

13:44.720 --> 13:49.800
freestyling, I mean, for better or for worse. But our friend Demorge would walk by right when you

13:49.800 --> 13:57.240
said it. Demorge always knew when I was going to say the n-word. Because you were rapping. Yeah, he was

13:57.240 --> 14:03.760
like, I'm going to go check that out. And that's what he sounds like. I'm not being racist. He has a

14:03.760 --> 14:12.120
deeper voice than me. A very masculine... How about every time a Johnny Cash song comes on? Well, that's

14:12.120 --> 14:17.880
just dicks and balls. I would offend gay people way more than before I offended black people. They

14:17.880 --> 14:23.640
could hear what I do, what I do in the car. Or maybe not, I don't know. Maybe I don't, because I don't...

14:23.640 --> 14:32.040
Yeah, it's almost like any Johnny Cash song. I put a hundred wieners in my mouth. I put my dick in the

14:32.040 --> 14:42.840
north and in the south. I put my balls and anus in my dick. I suck the balls. I lick the dick. It doesn't...

14:42.840 --> 14:52.800
It's so fun. I want to record an album. They love it. They love it. I put wieners in my balls and in my

14:52.800 --> 15:01.760
nuts. I put my dick in my anus as a butt. The fact that nuts rhymes with butts, by the way, is a fucking

15:01.760 --> 15:06.800
godsend. That's amazing. Money in the bank. The only thing that rhymes with mouth is south. You're

15:06.800 --> 15:10.640
fucked. As soon as you say mouth, Jeff starts rolling his eyes like, I guess something's going to be

15:10.640 --> 15:19.640
south next. But fucking nuts and butts. Like candies and nuts. That's fucking great for Johnny Cash

15:19.640 --> 15:24.800
riffing. I'm telling you, listen to any Johnny Cash song, and just start tapping your foot and just fucking

15:24.800 --> 15:27.640
go for it. You don't have to be clever. Just talk about...

15:27.640 --> 15:43.640
I'm not as familiar with this song, but it'll probably work. I'll start. I see your wiener coming. It's

15:43.640 --> 15:51.200
coming in my mouth. I've sucked in every direction from the north and to the south. Then I put your

15:51.200 --> 16:05.200
balls inside me and shoved them in my butt. I got sent to Folsom Prison for licking dicks and nuts.

16:05.200 --> 16:30.200
You take this one. Come on, Jeff. We'll go back and forth. Forget when he starts.

16:30.200 --> 16:40.200
I put my neck inside my mama's ear. I put my shoe inside. You hear it if she's queer. And if she's

16:40.200 --> 16:53.200
there, I say, come over here because she's gay. I fuck her ear. Everybody! See, that came off as

16:53.200 --> 17:06.200
anti-grandma. I want to record an album called Getting It Out of My System. You should see my

17:06.200 --> 17:11.200
girlfriend's eyes roll. It's like, Jesus Christ, when are you going to get tired of that? I don't know,

17:11.200 --> 17:19.200
man. Dicks and balls and nuts and butts. I can't stop. You never talk about, you don't like being

17:19.200 --> 17:23.200
alone and do you talk to yourself and you say you kind of mutter to yourself. When I'm alone at home,

17:23.200 --> 17:28.200
I don't know if I share this with any of you out there. I live alone. I haven't had a girlfriend in

17:28.200 --> 17:34.200
a thousand years. I'm a bachelor. I'm always either nude or in my underwear and I'm singing. I'm

17:34.200 --> 17:40.200
rapping, I'm singing, I'm dancing and it's so stupid and I play a game with myself. Can I embarrass

17:40.200 --> 17:47.200
myself? Can I get up to go make a sandwich from my couch and do a dance that even I go, dude, come on.

17:47.200 --> 17:52.200
And I can. It is possible to embarrass myself. And as I told you last week, I can't do it so that's why

17:52.200 --> 17:57.200
I have a girlfriend. I keep her around because you reminded me, I pulled this up. I want to see Jesus

17:57.200 --> 18:05.200
Christ Superstar with Aaron in New York and there's a song in there that's like, why should you want

18:05.200 --> 18:13.200
to know? Don't you know about the future? That song. It was so locked in my head. Jesus Christ Superstar

18:13.200 --> 18:19.200
is filled with these infectiously catchy, earworm songs and you can't stop. If you've never seen it,

18:19.200 --> 18:24.200
I swear it's the most obnoxious thing. It's the first time you watch Jesus Christ Superstar for the next

18:24.200 --> 18:29.200
three weeks. Your friends are going to hate you unless they're on the same mushroom and doing it with

18:29.200 --> 18:35.200
you. You're just going to be humming these songs and stuff. And I got re-initiated into it and I wrote

18:35.200 --> 18:41.200
this down. This is how pathetic I am because I was like, I'm really onto something here. Why put

18:41.200 --> 18:51.200
wieners in your butt? Don't you know your butt's for pooping? You got to keep the dicks outside. If you

18:51.200 --> 19:01.200
use your butt for wieners, you're going to make it get too wide. I have one that I created on the

19:01.200 --> 19:13.200
tour bus. Stuck in you. I got my penis so deep in your hole, now my dick's in your shoe. That's a

19:13.200 --> 19:23.200
long, long way. That is a long way. Lionel's right. Alternate timeline Lionel Richie is right about

19:23.200 --> 19:26.200
that. That's a long way when your dick's in the shoe. I thought you were going to do the Pringles

19:26.200 --> 19:34.200
thing. We've done Pringles Dicks before. For the nation. Has anyone heard the Pringles Dicks song

19:34.200 --> 19:41.200
here before? On the tour bus, I don't know if you guys have ever been on the road, taking a road

19:41.200 --> 19:46.200
trip. I've traveled around with some comedians and we do a thing. For some reason, our tour manager

19:46.200 --> 19:51.200
insists on Pringles. I don't know that any of us truly love Pringles, but they're there. They're

19:51.200 --> 19:59.200
ubiquitous. I picked up a tin of Pringles. The full tennis ball sized canister of Pringles. I held it

19:59.200 --> 20:05.200
to my dick. You want to sing it with me? No, you do it. Come on. Take your fun. I sit with a Pringles

20:05.200 --> 20:10.200
dick in my lap like it's a big hard-on, yeah. Some people call me Pringles dick, but I never really

20:10.200 --> 20:18.200
found out why. I don't really have a Pringles dick. I just keep my dick inside. I keep my dick

20:18.200 --> 20:25.200
inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis warm and dry. Some people call me Pringles dick, but

20:25.200 --> 20:30.200
I never really found out. No, I never found out. I never really found out why.

20:37.200 --> 20:43.200
It's really satisfying. We have a deep abiding passion for making up songs. We were talking weeks

20:43.200 --> 20:48.200
ago about how we miss golfing. We were golfing nine holes. That makes it sound like a bunch of rich

20:48.200 --> 20:53.200
twats. No, it's that shitty one in Waterville. Part three cars that cost five bucks. Everyone should

20:53.200 --> 20:58.200
go golfing. It's a good exercise, whatever. I'm not going to sell it. Fuck you. I am a rich

20:58.200 --> 21:04.200
twat. I was golfing with Jeff and we spent all nine holes the entire time. It just takes like

21:04.200 --> 21:14.200
an hour and a half or something. We got obsessed. We started singing the Nightcourt theme, which is like...

21:14.200 --> 21:21.200
A lot of you will be lost by this because you don't have that Nightcourt theme locked in your

21:21.200 --> 21:28.200
head. I started riffing lyrics to it and then we got obsessed. We got it fucking syllabically

21:28.200 --> 21:34.200
locked into this perfect Rubik's Cube. It has to sound exactly like the theme to Nightcourt's

21:34.200 --> 21:39.200
lyrics that if the producers of Nightcourt heard it, they would go, that's it. That's perfect.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.200
Nothing ironic.

21:40.200 --> 21:44.200
Does anyone here know? Can anyone think of the Nightcourt theme?

21:44.200 --> 21:46.200
Do you have it clear in your head?

21:46.200 --> 21:48.200
No.

21:48.200 --> 21:56.200
That was our challenge. We have to come up with Nightcourt lyrics that match it's syllabically

21:56.200 --> 22:01.200
perfect that are tight, no fucking ums, playing like syllabic games where you're like no repeating

22:01.200 --> 22:05.200
words just to fill in a syllable. But also it had to pass muster with the producers of

22:05.200 --> 22:07.200
Nightcourt in our head.

22:07.200 --> 22:11.200
I think if you and I stay friends until the day we both are dead.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.200
We'll never write a more perfect song.

22:13.200 --> 22:17.200
And also I think that was the acme of our friendship. I think you and I have never been

22:17.200 --> 22:18.200
closer.

22:18.200 --> 22:21.200
We've never been more productive. We've never been more joyful. We've never been more on

22:21.200 --> 22:25.200
the same team. I'd like to present to you my theme from Nightcourt because I can't say

22:25.200 --> 22:29.200
all that and then not do it.

22:29.200 --> 22:51.200
Days in the courtroom aren't much fun. Come to the Nightcourt, everyone.

22:51.200 --> 23:06.200
Your frown's on trial. Approach my smile. I sentence you to stay a while.

23:06.200 --> 23:10.200
And we were like just jumping up and down on the knife hole like we did it, we did it,

23:10.200 --> 23:11.200
we did it.

23:11.200 --> 23:15.200
And it's like that video game that you know no one can understand your mom comes in and

23:15.200 --> 23:18.200
goes why are you getting so frustrated by this thing? Why don't you just cheat or stop

23:18.200 --> 23:24.200
playing, then you'd win and you don't understand mom. I gotta collect all my cactus coins.

23:24.200 --> 23:29.200
Made it up, that's not a reference. There's no game out there with cactus coins.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.200
There was the putt one, the too much pepper one too.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.200
Yeah.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.200
Too much pepper.

23:34.200 --> 23:40.200
Yeah, I hit a putt. I hit it way farther past the hole than I originally was. And I went

23:40.200 --> 23:47.200
too much pepper on the pussy. That's all I had. I just said that. I think there was families

23:47.200 --> 23:51.200
on the adjacent holes.

23:51.200 --> 23:57.200
And I said, not enough salt on the balls. And then we spent the next hour trying to finish

23:57.200 --> 23:58.200
the song.

23:58.200 --> 24:03.200
Yeah, but by the eighth hole we had, mama's in the kitchen making titties too, and daddy's

24:03.200 --> 24:05.200
making business calls.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.200
It took us a long time.

24:08.200 --> 24:13.200
I was golfing on that same course that Pitchin put into Belle, and we're all terrible. But

24:13.200 --> 24:18.200
I hit a ball. It was just the worst shot. And I yelled the C word while we're at it.

24:18.200 --> 24:24.200
I just went, can't. And I look over and there's a father on a green right like 20 yards away

24:24.200 --> 24:28.200
from me with two like young boys, just like staring at me. The boys don't know what it

24:28.200 --> 24:38.200
is, but the father was giving me a look like, what are you doing? And I went, I can't golf.

24:38.200 --> 24:46.200
I was up all night in a wizard's sleeve. I can't golf.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.200
Well, good save.

24:48.200 --> 24:52.200
He didn't buy it for a second.

24:52.200 --> 24:58.200
I sacrificed my entire literary career as in books by doing this, by telling you this,

24:58.200 --> 25:02.200
because there's a very good chance that the guy I had a conversation with on the phone

25:02.200 --> 25:10.200
who would have been, if it weren't for me telling you this on a podcast, he would have been

25:10.200 --> 25:16.200
my literary agent. He would have maybe introduced me to book publishers. Now he'll hear this

25:16.200 --> 25:20.200
and go, why are you making fun of me on your thing and fuck you? But I have to tell you

25:20.200 --> 25:24.200
this quote. He said it and I couldn't hear the next eight things he said. I was like,

25:24.200 --> 25:30.200
I'm getting this exactly right because it's amazing what you just said.

25:30.200 --> 25:35.200
And I will preface it by saying, if he is listening, it's not like I think that you're

25:35.200 --> 25:38.200
an asshole or stupid or anything. It's just what you said was fucking amazing and had

25:38.200 --> 25:43.200
to be put under glass, like the Declaration of Independence, only it's a declaration of

25:43.200 --> 25:44.200
meaninglessness.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.200
Was this a prepared statement that you think he said?

25:47.200 --> 25:50.200
No, he was finding words. He's just talking. He's just talking. And this is amazing how

25:50.200 --> 25:54.200
what the human brain can come up with when you're just talking. Because he was explaining

25:54.200 --> 25:58.200
the current market out there. I was explaining what kind of books I would write if I could

25:58.200 --> 26:04.200
read a book and what kind of idea would be more sellable than another. And he was explaining

26:04.200 --> 26:11.200
the book marketplace to me and he said, you know, we are living in a world of extreme

26:11.200 --> 26:17.200
caution, except in cases where caution goes out the window in which case things can become

26:17.200 --> 26:34.200
quite reckless. That is the literary market in a nutshell.

26:34.200 --> 26:41.200
I make up words when I'm talking because I don't know what to say. I'm going to string

26:41.200 --> 26:48.200
the dots together and they might come out gay, but I don't mean homosexual. I don't want

26:48.200 --> 27:04.200
to offend anyone. I mean gay like it was retarded. There I go, gun. There you go, gun.

27:04.200 --> 27:14.200
By the way, my sister is retarded. Chiching. A comedic chiching.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.200
Now was there a discussion after he said that?

27:17.200 --> 27:25.200
No, maybe he heard my thumbs rattling on my iPhone. He was probably telling me to cure

27:25.200 --> 27:29.200
for cancer. I was like, give me, get this right before it seeps out of my 39 year old

27:29.200 --> 27:37.200
brain. Fred Wellard much? I was out of town. I missed the news. Well no one was there.

27:37.200 --> 27:42.200
Or he wouldn't have done it. What do you mean you were out of town? We were all out of town.

27:42.200 --> 27:48.200
I'm saying I had nothing to do with it. I was not around the TV or newspaper or anything.

27:48.200 --> 27:52.200
I only bring it up because I want to talk about how insane it is that people are still bothering

27:52.200 --> 27:59.200
to arrest people. What were the details of the actual case?

27:59.200 --> 28:07.200
If anyone's buying admission to your porno theater, they're obviously just a pre-internet

28:07.200 --> 28:13.200
person that wants to jerk off. Leave them alone. The idea, okay, here's the thing. If there's

28:13.200 --> 28:18.200
a law, if there's a statute, if there's a bylaw regarding what we do with our penises

28:18.200 --> 28:25.200
in public, it's probably well founded in some pre-internet history though. The idea behind

28:25.200 --> 28:32.200
the first person to say, you can't jerk off in a movie theater, there's a leprechaun.

28:32.200 --> 28:45.200
It was Sheriff O. Johnson. The idea of that was these movie theaters are so new and the

28:45.200 --> 28:50.200
women's titties are so big on the screen, everyone wants to just jerk off everywhere.

28:50.200 --> 28:55.200
If we don't put a cork in this, it's going to spread to the streets. That's not a risk

28:55.200 --> 29:00.200
anymore. These are like elephant graveyards. The only thing that's going to happen in there

29:00.200 --> 29:05.200
is a couple people that are left that don't have laptops just like jerking off. Who cares?

29:05.200 --> 29:09.200
Leave them alone. I've never been inside one of those establishments, but it seems to me

29:09.200 --> 29:16.200
that if I walked in there, I would see five or six guys jerking off. Why are you getting

29:16.200 --> 29:21.200
so high-voiced about it, man? They're not entitled to it, but don't get out of flashlight.

29:21.200 --> 29:28.200
What do you think you're going to find out is happening? What are you looking for? A

29:28.200 --> 29:34.200
guy writing his thesis? What are you trying to dig up and look at the business you're

29:34.200 --> 29:40.200
engaged in? Terrible. Has it been proven? I don't know anything. I'm basing on one of

29:40.200 --> 29:44.200
these comics. I just heard a thing in the lobby, and I have no idea what actually happened.

29:44.200 --> 29:49.200
What I do know is that apparently the only way it came to my attention was on Twitter

29:49.200 --> 29:54.200
and everybody coming to us rescued. Nobody wants to fuck with Fred Willard. He's hilarious.

29:54.200 --> 30:00.200
Also, there's a victimless crime. Even more than a victimless crime, he was making at

30:00.200 --> 30:06.200
least one person happy if he was doing that. We need more of that. Go pick on somebody who's

30:06.200 --> 30:12.200
doing something wrong to anybody. Anyways, I'm probably what I'm probably doing is contributing

30:12.200 --> 30:20.200
to the problem because of probably the story. I didn't actually research it. But then again,

30:20.200 --> 30:27.200
if I did, all I'd be reading is a bunch of... I was acquainted with this process. There's

30:27.200 --> 30:32.200
a Chinese telephone that happens online, and now I'll be quoted as saying that Chinese

30:32.200 --> 30:40.200
people are bad at making telephones. It's like the blogs, they just quote each other

30:40.200 --> 30:46.200
now. They're gone are the days of confirming things, talking to three different sources

30:46.200 --> 30:51.200
independently. There's no journalism left. There's just like, this is just in. Something

30:51.200 --> 30:58.200
is just in over there. It can get pretty fucking nuts pretty fast. For all I know, Fred Willard

30:58.200 --> 31:06.200
did absolutely nothing. He probably ate a piece of popcorn. On the off chance that he was

31:06.200 --> 31:11.200
jerking off, I am also on his side. I would say if I saw Fred Willard or me or you or

31:11.200 --> 31:16.200
anybody in this room walking into one of those theaters at 2 p.m., I would think that person

31:16.200 --> 31:22.200
would go, jerk off. And if it was Fred Willard, I'd offer to let him come on my face. Now

31:22.200 --> 31:32.200
we're getting some. Because he's amazing. Whatever. Jerking off, monkeys do it. They

31:32.200 --> 31:40.200
do it with frogs' mouths. What's that one monkey? Everyone's just fucking everybody.

31:40.200 --> 31:47.200
It's straight. It's gay. The bonobo chimp are closest genetic relative. The bonobo chimpanzee.

31:47.200 --> 31:53.200
For a long time, scientists just ignored the fact that the bonobo chimp out of all the

31:53.200 --> 31:59.200
varieties of chimps, chimps are 99% identical to us genetically. The bonobo chimp is 99

31:59.200 --> 32:04.200
point something. It's as close as you can get to human while staying at chimpanzee. It's

32:04.200 --> 32:11.200
our closest relative. And they do nothing but fucking jerk off. They have incest. They

32:11.200 --> 32:17.200
have gang bangs. They have gang wars. And then they settle the gang disputes by everybody

32:17.200 --> 32:23.200
fucking each other. Sisters and brothers and moms and uncles and fucking. And if you got

32:23.200 --> 32:29.200
nothing to do, you're just jerking it. These are horrible. By our standards, it's like,

32:29.200 --> 32:33.200
this is why the human race needs to give itself a break. We didn't invent anything that makes

32:33.200 --> 32:40.200
us unseemly. We didn't invent assassination, lying, war, anything. The only thing that

32:40.200 --> 32:44.200
makes humans different from all of our primate cousins is compassion. That's the one thing

32:44.200 --> 32:48.200
that we bring to the table that's brand new. We bring the concept that we actually kind

32:48.200 --> 32:52.200
of like each other and would even sometimes take a bullet for each other. That's our

32:52.200 --> 32:58.200
thing. That's what humanity is. All the stuff that we think is like original sin and

32:58.200 --> 33:03.200
all this stuff. It was invented by squirrel creatures that came before us. They started

33:03.200 --> 33:08.200
lying to each other with their faces. The first thing that happened is things that were

33:08.200 --> 33:13.200
climbing in trees, these mammals, they developed stereoscopic color vision because it helped

33:13.200 --> 33:19.200
them, number one, jump from branch to branch. Our eyes face forward, like 3D. So you can

33:19.200 --> 33:25.200
see in 3D. Unlike dogs and turtles and shit, you have depth perception. So you can jump

33:25.200 --> 33:30.200
from a branch to a branch. Then the other thing is, meanwhile, color vision. Why? Fruit.

33:30.200 --> 33:36.200
So you can tell the fruit's rotten or what the good stuff is. So with all of that, then

33:36.200 --> 33:39.200
the hair starts falling away from the face because what's happening at the same time

33:39.200 --> 33:46.200
is socially, sexually, politically, these primates as they became, they start communicating

33:46.200 --> 33:51.200
with each other with these new pieces of equipment, these state-of-the-art eyes that can see in

33:51.200 --> 33:58.200
vivid color and just maximum resolution. So the hair comes away from the face and our

33:58.200 --> 34:02.200
musculature and our faces becomes incredibly overdeveloped so we can make all these weird

34:02.200 --> 34:06.200
faces. Way before we could talk, way before we could do any of that, we were lying to

34:06.200 --> 34:11.200
each other by winking and squinting and smiling. These little squirrel-like creatures, even

34:11.200 --> 34:18.200
before they were monkeys, they were starting to do that shit. You can leverage your fellow

34:18.200 --> 34:23.200
primate by going, hey, that guy likes you over there, not as much as she does. She says

34:23.200 --> 34:27.200
weird shit about you, but I don't agree. Everyone's fucking with each other because it means the

34:27.200 --> 34:34.200
difference between life and death. They invented that shit, not us. We inherited it. We don't

34:34.200 --> 34:40.200
have to be bad people to each other. Humanity does not give itself a break. Speaking of

34:40.200 --> 34:45.200
breaks, some of you may have been here two weeks ago and my lovely girlfriend, the love

34:45.200 --> 34:51.200
of my life, Erin McGathy, was a guest comp-troller. You can applaud for her, I guess, but that

34:51.200 --> 34:56.200
means nothing now that I asked you to. I don't have her back or anything. If you guys ask

34:56.200 --> 35:05.200
me to, I'll sell her out in a second. Erin is funnier than me, smarter than me. Don't

35:05.200 --> 35:10.200
hold that against her or anything and don't try to prove that that's not the case. But

35:10.200 --> 35:17.200
she and Jeff are like beta fish. They both love me very much. One of their primary points

35:17.200 --> 35:27.200
of contention is we like to have game nights and Erin likes to explain and run games. Some

35:27.200 --> 35:35.200
of you even in this audience have been back to my place, Danadoo, where we'll play catchphrase

35:35.200 --> 35:41.200
or apples to apples or celebrity. Erin, thankfully, because I don't want to do it, she always

35:41.200 --> 35:49.200
steps up and wants to control the game. Jeff and her had an evening once where it was very

35:49.200 --> 35:56.200
uncomfortable for me and that's what matters. Erin was trying to explain the game of catchphrase.

35:56.200 --> 36:06.200
For 45 minutes. Conservatively, 40 minutes. People were peeing their pants.

36:06.200 --> 36:11.200
Then Jeff, after we gave up, people were like, can we just drink and have a fun time? Yeah,

36:11.200 --> 36:18.200
let's do it. Then Jeff, as a big fan of efficiency, explained to Erin privately in the corner

36:18.200 --> 36:24.200
of the party how badly she had done explaining the game for two hours. Not true. Not true.

36:24.200 --> 36:29.200
Yeah, there's a lot of subjectivity. No, it's not true. The important, the objective truth.

36:29.200 --> 36:34.200
I was going to keep saying it until the behavior changed. The objective truth is that there

36:34.200 --> 36:42.200
was a little tender spot there. It was an event. Erin has a great desire to get up and run a game

36:42.200 --> 36:46.200
night, which is great. You need someone to do that. If you're game playing people, let's

36:46.200 --> 36:50.200
all play catchphrase. Let's play apples to apples. Let's play the Leonard Malton movie

36:50.200 --> 36:56.200
game. Let's do that. I'd say get on with it. I would say at some point, let's start playing

36:56.200 --> 37:03.200
the fucking thing. This was like Nicholas Nicolby, man. It was an eight act play of how to play

37:03.200 --> 37:09.200
a game. Our friend David Butler leans up and goes, it's like $20,000 pyramid except you can't

37:09.200 --> 37:18.200
use your hands. I'm like, yeah, yes. I have made my stance on Erin's love of game play

37:18.200 --> 37:25.200
versus the incredible deficit between her ability to do it functionally. I've gone on record.

37:25.200 --> 37:33.200
I've been very candid about it. Let's play a new segment in Harmontown. She proposed,

37:33.200 --> 37:37.200
let's do a segment. We don't know anything about it other than its title. It's called

37:37.200 --> 37:49.200
Erin McGathy's Game Corner. Do you want to pick a theme song or anything? Let me see what I got.

37:49.200 --> 38:04.200
Say it again. It's called Erin McGathy's Game Corner.

38:04.200 --> 38:17.200
Thanks for that intro, guys. Super supportive. Really nice.

38:17.200 --> 38:23.200
This isn't supposed to be a bit about how I'm bad at explaining games.

38:23.200 --> 38:38.200
Welcome to Erin McGathy's Game Corner. The two players in tonight's game are Dan Harmon and

38:38.200 --> 38:47.200
Jeff Davis. If we can have them sit in the McGathey Game Corner seats. The game tonight is the

38:47.200 --> 38:55.200
Anthony game. Everyone plays it all the time. The Anthony game. Is there an Anthony in the

38:55.200 --> 39:07.200
audience who I interviewed earlier? Anthony, come on down. Let's go to the round of applause for Anthony.

39:07.200 --> 39:13.200
Also, is there anybody precocious and in need of some stage time? Right now, just raise your

39:13.200 --> 39:18.200
hand. Green shirt, you got a smiley face on it. You look cute. That's the guy that gave the

39:18.200 --> 39:31.200
thumbs down to Dumbledore. Come on down. What is your name, smiley face? Justin.

39:31.200 --> 39:38.200
Tonight's game is the Anthony game. Before the show, I walked out and I saw Anthony in line

39:38.200 --> 39:49.200
and I interviewed him about his life. The two of you are going to guess, you're going to answer

39:49.200 --> 39:59.200
questions about Anthony's life. The first person to 15 points wins the McTrophy. Because my last

39:59.200 --> 40:05.200
name is McGathey. McTrophy. There are four different categories that you can choose from

40:05.200 --> 40:18.200
question-wise. Love, childhood, personality, and wild. Anthony, before we get started, can you tell

40:18.200 --> 40:25.200
Jeff and Dana, what do you do, Anthony? I'm a PA. Are you a PA for anything right now? No, not

40:25.200 --> 40:30.200
right now. I mainly work in post-production. What's your favorite sound effect? My favorite sound

40:30.200 --> 40:40.200
effect? Just do it. I like the slide whistle. Let's hear what it sounds like. Perfect. That's all you

40:40.200 --> 40:51.200
get to know about Anthony. Welcome to the Anthony game. So Jeff, you're going first. You can choose

40:51.200 --> 40:57.200
from the category love, childhood, personality, or wild. Anthony and his girlfriend have been

40:57.200 --> 41:25.200
dating for A. False. 15 points. You're a real hero. Anthony and his girlfriend have been dating

41:25.200 --> 41:38.200
for A. One year, B. One month, C. He does not currently have a girlfriend. I hate to dog pile. I'm

41:38.200 --> 41:43.200
going to go with C. That is correct. He does not currently have a girlfriend. One point on the

41:43.200 --> 41:51.200
board for Jeff Davis. Your best years are ahead of you. Dan Harmon, you may choose from the

41:51.200 --> 42:00.200
category love, childhood, personality, or wild. Personality. Before the show, Anthony described

42:00.200 --> 42:14.200
himself as one of the four seasons. He's lying. He's white. Not the band. They're all white. I

42:14.200 --> 42:30.200
thought you meant the four tops. He's Frankie Valley. Which of the four seasons, winter, spring,

42:30.200 --> 42:41.200
summer, or fall, did Anthony describe himself as? Definitely fall. That is correct. He's wearing

42:41.200 --> 42:49.200
autumnal colors even. He actually has the fall foliage colors. And his eyes are dying. Once

42:49.200 --> 43:00.200
beautiful leaves, they're turning. He's falling into Anthony Gay. The game where Anthony gets

43:00.200 --> 43:12.200
made fun of. There will only be one loser. There's going to be a cash prize for him, by the

43:12.200 --> 43:24.200
way. I'll give it to him. Love, childhood, personality, wild. Anthony has A. Never broken

43:24.200 --> 43:34.200
a bone. Or B. Never broken a sweat because he has a sweat gland disorder. Hey. You are

43:34.200 --> 43:46.200
correct. Harmon, love, childhood, personality, wild. Love. His least favorite thing, Anthony's

43:46.200 --> 43:58.200
least favorite thing about women, his pet peeve with women, his dates, is A, that they're

43:58.200 --> 44:06.200
overly controlling. B, that they're overly sensitive. Or C, that they're overly slutty

44:06.200 --> 44:24.200
bitches. My hook or my crook. He seems like a good kid. Sensitive or controlling. His biggest

44:24.200 --> 44:36.200
complaint about women would be, I would say A, controlling, controlling. Anthony. B. Sensitive.

44:36.200 --> 44:44.200
It's extra, whenever we don't get one right, it's like, oh, shit, another question. That

44:44.200 --> 44:51.200
just added seven minutes to the show. We should start conferring together. We're going to open

44:51.200 --> 44:56.200
up to the crowd. We're going to get this. The 10 point round. We enter the lightning

44:56.200 --> 45:04.200
round. Entering the lightning round. Anthony's favorite part of the women's body is A, boobs,

45:04.200 --> 45:12.200
B, but C, back, D, the top softest part of their head. Legs, legs, legs, legs. Back,

45:12.200 --> 45:23.200
back, back. It's called the lungs. Anthony's celebrity crush. You have to wait until the

45:23.200 --> 45:28.200
end of the question. Jennifer Anderson. Is A, Emma Watson, B, Kate Blanchett, C, Kira

45:28.200 --> 45:37.200
Knightley. Go. Knightley. Watson. Yes, Dan is correct. It's Emma Watson. Anthony was born

45:37.200 --> 45:45.200
in Denver, raised in A, Miami, B, Boston, C, New Orleans, D, Modesto, E, Cleveland. Jesus

45:45.200 --> 45:59.200
Christ. D, D, F, A, B, C, F, Modesto, Miami, Boston. They're other ones. Miami, Boston,

45:59.200 --> 46:08.200
New Orleans, C, Cleveland. Yes, Jeff is correct. This game has loopholes, Dan. You can just

46:08.200 --> 46:17.200
say them all. Remember them all and say them in order. That one was hard because there

46:17.200 --> 46:26.200
was 11. That kind of threw us. The human brain remembers seven things. When Jeff does

46:26.200 --> 46:33.200
T, A hurts my feelings. B makes me feel bad about myself. C makes me feel insecure. All

46:33.200 --> 46:44.200
right. Here we go. Childhood. Anthony, we're all very, we're friends. I know. Okay. All

46:44.200 --> 46:54.200
right. Anthony's favorite show. I'm just making fun of you. That's fine. Your bit implies

46:54.200 --> 46:58.200
that you would actually prefer if we were very stoic and took it all reason. That would

46:58.200 --> 47:04.200
be fucking a horror. Play the game, Herman. You don't want us to take this seriously.

47:04.200 --> 47:09.200
No, I don't. Maybe my part of the bit is that I'm reacting to what you're doing.

47:09.200 --> 47:14.200
All right. We're all yes-yending each other. It's like Inception, which is my favorite

47:14.200 --> 47:22.200
movie. All right. When Dan and I have sex, he, A, makes me wear a tie, B, makes me wear

47:22.200 --> 47:27.200
boots, D, makes me come here and gel it, D, makes me pretend that I'm controlling a

47:27.200 --> 47:34.200
show. No laugh. I'm sorry. That was a bit hard. Dustin, edit that out. All right. Here

47:34.200 --> 47:40.200
we go. Anthony's favorite. Leave it in. That stays in the fucking cut. I'm really sorry.

47:40.200 --> 47:49.200
Halfway done, you guys. Cirque du Soleil is coming out at the break. Anthony's favorite

47:49.200 --> 47:55.200
show as a child was, A, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, B, She-Ra, C, Simpsons, B, The New

47:55.200 --> 47:59.200
Kids on the Block cartoon show. Simpsons. New Kids on the Block cartoon show. She-Ra.

47:59.200 --> 48:05.200
Simpsons is correct. He's not old enough for She-Ra. You dumbass. All right. The first

48:05.200 --> 48:12.200
person to describe, sorry, Anthony's sibling situation, like how many brothers and sisters

48:12.200 --> 48:21.200
are there? Suicide. Will they, won't they? Abject shame. I made up a new word that's

48:21.200 --> 48:28.200
a compound word. Abject shame. All right. I'll take the answer. Who said hot? Me. So I've

48:28.200 --> 48:35.200
got 14 points. All right. Final question. Final. But we're tied at 14, right? Final

48:35.200 --> 48:38.200
question. I'm not good at math, but I'm pretty sure we're tied. Justin? This is the final

48:38.200 --> 48:47.200
question. It's worth 80 points. There we go. That's the stuff. Was he brought up A, Methodist,

48:47.200 --> 49:02.200
B, Baptist, C, Catholic, D, Pentecostal? I know this. My vote, D. What? Pentecostal. Because

49:02.200 --> 49:06.200
I know one other person from Cleveland. He was Pentecostal. I'm going Pentecostal as well.

49:06.200 --> 49:16.200
That is incorrect. I'll give you another chance to pick your answer. Presbyterian. Methodist.

49:16.200 --> 49:25.200
What was the, Baptist? No. I'll say Methodist. I'll say Baptist. Methodist. Catholic. Yes.

49:25.200 --> 49:37.200
We did it. All right. Final score. Justin, here, let me get you on the mic. Final score.

49:37.200 --> 49:44.200
Thank you, Aaron. Final score was Dan Four and Jeff 30 million and 11. Let's hear for

49:44.200 --> 49:51.200
our scorekeeper, Justin. For Anthony, for enduring all of the scrutiny. And also for

49:51.200 --> 50:00.200
Erin McGathy. Erin McGathy's Game Corner. Anthony, I'm giving you a crisp one day of

50:00.200 --> 50:10.200
PA pay. Yes. That was fucking rough on him. That was rough. Well, yeah, Anthony wants to

50:10.200 --> 50:14.200
say something. I think he's entitled. I think that's the best version of a game show about my

50:14.200 --> 50:26.200
life that there could be. Jeff just matched the hundred. So Anthony walked away, $200 richer,

50:26.200 --> 50:39.200
just an irreplaceable piece of his soul shy. I'm sure that's... Did anyone else in here

50:39.200 --> 50:48.200
sympathize most with me? Just really put yourself in my shoes. Who cares whether she's good

50:48.200 --> 50:56.200
or bad or whether he's right or wrong? What about me? Put yourself in my shoes in the sitcom

50:56.200 --> 51:04.200
of my life. These two going at each other. It's a rough life for me. This is happening

51:04.200 --> 51:12.200
to me. I think she's fantastic. I think you're fantastic too, Jeff. I wish you would just

51:12.200 --> 51:21.200
fucking get it over with. I think she thinks the same thing about us and...

51:21.200 --> 51:25.200
Now, Dan, I know that we might have drifted kind of far afield, but tonight we announced

51:25.200 --> 51:30.200
that the topic tonight was technology. So let's roll into these technology questions.

51:30.200 --> 51:35.200
Dan Harmon, as a dutiful mayor of Harmontown, went amongst the attendees here, the loyal

51:35.200 --> 51:42.200
Armenians, and went out and asked people technology questions. I pulled a few out of the bucket

51:42.200 --> 51:44.200
here. Would you like me to crack this off, Dan?

51:44.200 --> 51:46.200
Yes, yes, yes. Crack it, crack it.

51:46.200 --> 51:48.200
In no particular order. Let's do...

51:48.200 --> 51:55.200
By the way, tonight's question round is brought to you by a sponsor. This is what Jeff and

51:55.200 --> 52:00.200
I decided we were going to do. We're going to break the mold with sponsorship. We're not

52:00.200 --> 52:03.200
going to just do the Adam and Eve spot that you hear on other podcasts. There's like a

52:03.200 --> 52:07.200
couple of people who are financing podcasts right now. We're the early days of this new

52:07.200 --> 52:12.200
medium, and what's happening is there's a couple of sponsors that are kind of bank-rolling

52:12.200 --> 52:19.200
everybody. We have overhead. You saw us give a couple of hundreds to Anthony just through

52:19.200 --> 52:26.200
it, Adam. Destroyed your soul. Here's... I have a hundred, kid. We got that kind of overhead.

52:26.200 --> 52:31.200
We're going to hold out. We're not going to do spots for sex toys or whatever you hear

52:31.200 --> 52:39.200
on This Feels Terrible or any of those podcasts, or Marc Maron. Coming for you, bro. We want

52:39.200 --> 52:44.200
the big ones. We're going to pioneer. I want Nike. The way we're going to get Nike isn't

52:44.200 --> 52:50.200
going to be by going hat in hand. We're going to do spots for free for fucking Adidas until

52:50.200 --> 53:00.200
Nike begs for mercy. Do you hear that, Nike? Fuck faces? You give us our fucking money,

53:00.200 --> 53:05.200
or we're going to keep promoting Adidas. You pieces of shit. The tables are turned.

53:05.200 --> 53:11.200
Dan, N-word. I own both Nike and Adidas. I'm wearing Adidas because those Nike people,

53:11.200 --> 53:15.200
they just won't fucking pick up the phone. They don't give a shit what people think.

53:15.200 --> 53:24.200
George Bush and Nike don't give a shit about black people. Adidas, I think they helped

53:24.200 --> 53:30.200
in Katrina. I didn't do any research, but I'm pretty sure they...

53:30.200 --> 53:34.200
Adidas flew in a giant shoe and everybody got in it. I'm pretty sure Adidas loves everyone

53:34.200 --> 53:39.200
of all colors, and I'm wearing the shoes to prove it. This run is brought to you by Adidas,

53:39.200 --> 53:49.200
Nike. Harmon, let's see here. I like TV. I like the internet someone posits. Does

53:49.200 --> 53:58.200
internet hurt TV overall? Yeah. All right, next question. Shit. You see Aaron, it can

53:58.200 --> 54:09.200
be done. There's a lot of robot questions. I want to get to some robot questions here.

54:09.200 --> 54:18.200
Here's one I liked a lot. Is the singularity nigh, and if so, how will it affect my sex

54:18.200 --> 54:26.200
life, be as specific as possible? Is the physical singularity, the possible of all mass

54:26.200 --> 54:34.200
and matter in the universe, re-coalescing into one infinitely dense point? That's the opposite

54:34.200 --> 54:38.200
of the Big Bang, right? No, is that what... Wait, so come up here, sir. Come up here. Tell

54:38.200 --> 54:44.200
us what the singularity is, just to... Is it a sitcom? I just watched Terminator,

54:44.200 --> 54:52.200
Sarah Connor Chronicles, and they defined it. Come on, robots. Become so smart that they

54:52.200 --> 54:58.200
can replicate themselves with smarter versions of robots. That's what they said.

54:58.200 --> 55:06.200
All right. Is that... Can I get a second nerd pinion? All right, you come up here. This

55:06.200 --> 55:13.200
guy's got a shirt on that says, God is a Moog. You're not a musician. It's okay. So

55:13.200 --> 55:18.200
technological singularity, when technology becomes so advanced that it exceeds human

55:18.200 --> 55:29.200
intelligence. Like Skynet. Yeah, like Skynet. You guys are not enemies of each other. The

55:29.200 --> 55:33.200
singularity does come. They're going to drive a wedge between you. You're going to be in

55:33.200 --> 55:42.200
the same trench, using dogs to detect rubber people. Get along. Raise your standards. Lower

55:42.200 --> 55:51.200
them. All right. No, the singularity is not nigh because of capitalism. You can't make

55:51.200 --> 55:57.200
a fucking flash drive that works on two computers in the same day. We are a long ways. We have

55:57.200 --> 56:01.200
to have a complete societal collapse before we're able to make technology that actually

56:01.200 --> 56:07.200
functions in a cohesive way. We're still trying to figure out... We're all caught up. We have

56:07.200 --> 56:11.200
so much technology right now. We could make anything we wanted. We have the technology

56:11.200 --> 56:16.200
to make like a robot dude that would walk around in high five everybody. We just can't do it

56:16.200 --> 56:21.200
because the Sony says, well, it should have a memory stick in it. And then Microsoft is

56:21.200 --> 56:28.200
going, I think it should have a micro bead. All right, Harmon. Another question. What

56:28.200 --> 56:34.200
fictional piece of technology would you most like to see in real life? For example, hover

56:34.200 --> 56:38.200
boards, they say. What fictional piece of technology would you like to see in real life?

56:38.200 --> 56:42.200
Right, right, right. Oh, that's great. That's fucking great. That's so great it'll destroy

56:42.200 --> 56:46.200
the show because I have to think about it so long. It's like asking a fat kid what kind

56:46.200 --> 56:57.200
of hot dog. Because I'm going to go with wizard sleeve. Hey, that exists, man. It's right down

56:57.200 --> 57:10.200
the street. I'm torn between... I want virtual reality on a level where the video games are

57:10.200 --> 57:18.200
just like holodeck, holodeck. I want to be able to simulate fictional realities. That's

57:18.200 --> 57:23.200
the fictional science that I want more than anything. Because teleportation, all you're

57:23.200 --> 57:30.200
going to be able to do is go to Afghanistan really fast. It's still shitty there. I want

57:30.200 --> 57:38.200
video games to be so good that I don't care that Afghanis are outside my door. They're

57:38.200 --> 57:45.200
really very upset. I want to spend the last years of my life pretending I'm Sherlock Holmes

57:45.200 --> 57:56.200
and solving the case of the missing pussy. Easiest case to solve in my version. I'm knee

57:56.200 --> 58:14.200
deep in it. Elementary, my dear Watson. Dan, what rights do robots have? Three. Robots

58:14.200 --> 58:21.200
don't have rights. This is a popular thing in fictional... We look forward to this day

58:21.200 --> 58:25.200
as a singularity issue too. We're going to eventually create life. This is what humans

58:25.200 --> 58:30.200
do. The mythology I think is very interesting. I believe... I think Joseph Campbell hinted

58:30.200 --> 58:38.200
at this. Props, Joey. I read a book, one of Joseph Campbell's books. He referred to the

58:38.200 --> 58:45.200
lock-and-tumbler type of instinct. There's another type of instinct, which is an open-ended

58:45.200 --> 58:54.200
instinct. An example of that is a species of moth that they studied where they noticed

58:54.200 --> 59:02.200
that the female of the species had a certain shade color of their wings. The males preferred

59:02.200 --> 59:09.200
the ladies that had a darker shade. They made an unreasonably dark-winged moth that was

59:09.200 --> 59:16.200
just a fake moth, a Jessica Rabbit moth. The male moths wouldn't even... At the detriment

59:16.200 --> 59:21.200
of their own species, you could put a real live moth in a cage with this other moth and

59:21.200 --> 59:26.200
you just put this fake-ass Jessica Rabbit moth in there. The male moth would just hump

59:26.200 --> 59:31.200
this fucking piece of cardboard because it was darker even though it wasn't even possible

59:31.200 --> 59:38.200
to see it. Campbell refers to this open-ended instinct. Some organisms are capable of thinking...

59:38.200 --> 59:43.200
Here's a great example of lock-and-tumbler, just to contrast it more. I find this shit

59:43.200 --> 59:49.200
so fascinating. There are chicks, baby chicks. There's a species of hawk that fly over chicken

59:49.200 --> 59:59.200
coops. Chicks, when they see its silhouette in the sky, they'll head for cover. They made

59:59.200 --> 01:00:03.200
a model of a hawk and they ran it over the chicken coop. The chicks run for cover. Then

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:08.200
they ran it over backwards and the chicks didn't run for cover because it wasn't the exact

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:13.200
image that the chick needs to see to make it run for cover. It was flying backwards.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.200
A newborn chick, just born with a script that it was running. If it doesn't fit the cue

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.200
exactly, then the chick doesn't engage in the behavior instinctively. Contrast that with

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:31.200
a moth that wants to fuck the darker chick the better. Humanity's mythology is an open-ended

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:36.200
instinct for the behavior that we want to emulate. We have a blueprint on our nervous

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:43.200
system. We know the qualities that a perfect being possesses. Our gods are the things that

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.200
we want to become. We know that our job is to cheat death. We know that it's to populate

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:53.200
the universe. We know that we need to create life. Look at what we do to ourselves in the

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.200
pursuit of perfection. Our perfection has nothing to do with ourselves. We kill ourselves.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:03.200
We literally kill each other and ourselves. A plane goes down and we don't make planes illegal.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.200
We go, 500 people. Fuck it. I hope tomorrow's better, but we gotta fucking do some shit.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:13.200
We gotta get on the moon. We have an open-ended instinct for perfecting ourselves. One of

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.200
those things is we are absolutely obsessed, obsessed with, you see that you Google it

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:23.200
and it's just like these Japanese robot legs. We almost got it. We almost got it. We can

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.200
make a fucking weird thing go up the stairs and it unsettles us. We're almost there. We

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:33.200
want to make people. We want to make ourselves and we will do it. We're going to fuck ourselves

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.200
over. They're going to murder us. They will. That's the singularity. I didn't know there

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.200
was a word for it, but they're going to fucking kill us because they're going to be better

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.200
than us and we're going to be happy to die. Somebody told me once, it was Stephen Notley,

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:53.200
the creator of Bob the Angry Flower, the only Canadian I've ever liked. That's going to

01:01:53.200 --> 01:02:01.200
cost me a couple listeners. Take that, North America. Take that half of the English-speaking

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:11.200
continent. He and I were talking science one night. He's a huge awesome nerd. He was talking

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:15.200
about this thing that he read about the idea that information is the only thing that's

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:22.200
evolving and that humans are the patsy, that genetically passed information. Humans inventing

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:29.200
computers represents us passing on the ability to store more information in a more compact

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.200
space than the universe was able to assemble on its own using just these kind of molecules

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:39.200
that are in our cells. We've gotten to the point where these cells in our bodies are just

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.200
these little computers and they're tightly coiled like little X and Y chromosomes. Not

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.200
in ropes wrapped around each other, compressed so hard and when they have to reproduce, they

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:53.200
unravel and they're like a million miles long and they're just like tangled up. That's the

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.200
technology you're limited to if you haven't invented computers yet and you can't make a

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:03.200
lot of a big bang. You can only make a bunch of molecules run into each other so we represent

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:09.200
the cutting edge. We are the Apple laptop of biological information storage and we are

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.200
now what are we doing? What are we obsessed with? To the absolute exclusion of ourselves.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.200
There are people starving in the streets. We're stepping over them on our way to develop

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:25.200
what technology we need to create ways to store more information than we can store and I really

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:31.200
do have this unsettling feeling that once we do it, we're just going to be monkeys hanging

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.200
out and we're going to find out we've been had. Well somebody asks here Dan, is the technological

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:43.200
revolution the beginning of the human evolution into cyborgs? Yes. That's right, that's right.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.200
But they won't even look like cyborgs. It's just going to be this floating thing and part

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.200
of what I said earlier, humanity needs to give itself more credit. Where are we headed that's

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.200
fucking beautiful. Who do you hate your neighbor? Do you think he's racist? Do you think he's

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.200
a pedophile? Do you think he's greedy? Do you think he's mad at you? Do you think he's

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:06.200
greedy? Whatever he is, at least he's human. He's not an ant yet. So much of what we try

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:11.200
to do, it's the best intentions but we police each other. I go, Daniel, don't make a rape

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:16.200
joke, we caught you. It's fascism and we're clamping down on each other as we enter this

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.200
age of internet, like everyone's saying shit in comedy clubs that they feel free to say.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.200
And then now it goes up on YouTube and then everyone, now you're doing this new Elizabethan

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:29.200
age of like, fuck you, I caught you. We want to put this fucking clamp on each other. To

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:34.200
what end? When are we going to be perfect? And what is that perfection going to resemble?

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:39.200
We are going to be fucked over. We've got to embrace the animal side of us. We feel

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:45.200
something. When we feel hatred, at least we're at least there's something happening there

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.200
that doesn't happen with giraffes, sharks, fucking ants and whatever this thing we're

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:56.200
creating is. We should tread carefully. I said last week, I don't know if I made the

01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:02.200
final edit but we need a pro-human code because we are just this close. We're going to do

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:05.200
it. We're going to make these things and they're going to be more important to us and

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.200
they're going to, we need to be prepared to say to those things, fuck you, we're more

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:15.200
important because we're stupid or ignorant. We're angry. We have hormones. Something's

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:22.200
valuable about this or not but that's the side we need to be on. Maybe they are better

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:26.200
than us, these things that we're going to create. Fuck them. Have you ever been jealous of

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:30.200
someone? Fuck them. That's like human instinct. Jealous of you. I don't want you to

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.200
succeed. I hate you. You're better than me. It's like parents and their children. That

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.200
incredible jealousy that some parents have over their children. Yeah, we're going to

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.200
make these things that are going to eat us up. In a certain sense, they're already doing

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.200
it. The devices, the things we carry in our pockets, they're swallowing us up. They're

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.200
changing the way we have sex with each other. They're changing what we say to each other.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:54.200
Every time, what are we doing in the meantime? We're all gathered around this big, giant

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:59.200
fucking cyborg that we're going to build and it's going to eat us. That giant cyborg,

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.200
whether he eats us or not, he will be wearing Adidas shoes. Yes. That's thank you for

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:09.200
getting to my point. Because that cyborg will make the logical choice for comfortable

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:19.200
footwear. Nike. And until such time as I get a giant fucking check from an unnamed

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:23.200
company, I'm not going to change my position on that. All right, let's do that. Dan, do

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.200
you want to pick a number of words to answer some questions I have in my hand right now?

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:33.200
Do you want to limit yourself? I say we leave it to one of the two black people in the

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:42.200
front row. I just noticed I've ignored you, which either makes me less or more racist.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:50.200
I don't know. Two black harmonetownians in the front row, I say, we'll turn our attention

01:06:50.200 --> 01:07:02.200
to you, sir. What's your name? NT? N-T-I? Cyborg. Cyborg. That's how they're going to get us.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:07.200
That's what it is, that Skynet, of course, the first cyborgs will be black because we

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:15.200
won't question them as much. If he's in a Starbucks, you're just happy to have him. It

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.200
makes you feel less guilty. You're not going to, like, corner him and ask him, why are

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:25.200
you listening to that weird modem sound? You'll start listening to a modem sound. You

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:33.200
fucking love it. It'll seem hip. All right, anyways. NT. N-T-I. NT. Pick a number between

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:43.200
two and six. Four. All right. Forward answers. Thank you, NT. Forward answers. Thank you.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:50.200
Sorry, racist. Sorry. Here we go. All right. Where should I go to survive the robot

01:07:50.200 --> 01:08:05.200
apocalypse of 2014? Flagstaff, Arizona during Christmas. That's not random. I'll explain

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:23.200
later. What is a swamp donkey? Part donkey, part swamp. Should robot marriage be legal?

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:34.200
Only among consenting robots. Nice. Pen or techno pen? Obviously, techno pen. N-word.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:40.200
N-word. All right. Thank you very much for coming, everybody. That's been Harmontown.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:50.200
We love you all. Thank you. Music. Olivia Newton, John, and EO. All right. We did it.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:55.200
Thanks for coming, guys. You were a joy. You were a fantastic audience. Wonderful. Tell

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.200
that to the next audience, whatever you figured out. You guys are really great. Thank you

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:03.200
so much for coming down. A couple of quick thank yous right now. I want to thank Katie

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:08.200
Levine for doing our audio recording. Zac McKeever, our tech guy, Emily Gordon, producer

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:13.200
for our live show. Danielle Cramer, program director. Justin Marshall, our podcast producer.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:18.200
Mo Fathelbab, onsite director. And Jenny Fine, our fantastic artist. Thank you so much

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:23.200
for coming down. Also, thank everybody here at the beautiful NerdMelt Theater. I'm Jeff

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:35.200
Davis, your comment controller. One more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon.
