{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:25.000\nI call this Harmontown to order. Ladies and gentlemen, how are you doing tonight? Fantastic.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:29.720\nWelcome to the Nerdist Theater in downtown Hollywood, California. Thank you, loyal Armenians\n\n00:29.720 --> 00:33.720\nfor being here at the Nerdmelt Nerdist Theater. And thank you for listening in Podcast Land.\n\n00:33.720 --> 00:38.360\nLadies and gentlemen, the last week we tabled the issue of child abuse and peeing in your pants.\n\n00:38.360 --> 00:44.240\nTonight's topic, we tend to discuss technology. Please put your hands together for the mayor\n\n00:44.240 --> 01:01.400\nof Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon. Thank you. You're very kind. You're good people. Very excited.\n\n01:01.400 --> 01:07.240\nI'm in a very good mood tonight. Why is that? I'm writing two TV pilots for networks that were\n\n01:07.240 --> 01:18.320\nkicking my ass on the ratings when I was at NBC. It's very satisfying. For three years,\n\n01:18.320 --> 01:28.160\nI was told, get higher ratings. I figured out how. I know exactly how I'm going to do it.\n\n01:28.160 --> 01:40.480\nI'm going to go to the networks that have higher ratings. I feel good about my decision. I'm\n\n01:40.480 --> 01:48.080\na smirky, smug, self-satisfied, third act of a rom-com kind of mood. I just feel like I'm in\n\n01:48.080 --> 01:53.760\nthe middle of a montage where there's dissolving charts that are going up and Casey Kasem's\n\n01:53.760 --> 02:02.640\nmentioning me and Sigourney Weaver seeing my ad on TV and changing her mind about my wacky ways.\n\n02:02.640 --> 02:10.520\nThings are moving up for Old Man Ghostbuster. That's the reference I was making. You 25-year-old\n\n02:10.520 --> 02:17.200\nfucks. Sorry, that's a trademark of the show. I get angry at you for being young. But I'm not\n\n02:17.200 --> 02:24.600\nin a get-off-my-lawn mood. I'm in a get-on-my-lawn mood. Get on my lawn, you fuckers. Let's party\n\n02:24.600 --> 02:34.040\ndown like we're at a Yanni concert. There was a guy named Yanni. You young fucks. You are in a\n\n02:34.040 --> 02:41.560\nget-off-my-lawn mood. Deep down, you are. Nah, nah. I love you, kids. I love you so much. I'm\n\n02:41.560 --> 02:49.080\ngoing to write a pilot for CBS. That's how much I love you. That's a weird reaction.\n\n02:49.080 --> 02:56.160\nNow, if I were you guys, I see that the tweeters that are coming back at me in the comment sections\n\n02:56.160 --> 03:02.280\nunder the press releases are like, well, that sucks. Because it's like, oh, he's selling out. Yeah,\n\n03:02.280 --> 03:10.920\nmaybe. I might. For like six months, I might give that a taste. I might kick back in a hammock a\n\n03:10.920 --> 03:16.720\nlittle bit and get out of Hanna-Barbera remote-controlled lawnmower, sip out of a coconut.\n\n03:16.720 --> 03:23.040\nI was told not to work so hard for three years. I'm going to put that theory to the test, see\n\n03:23.040 --> 03:32.000\nwhat kind of TV that generates. Do you have any ideas? No, sir, no. No. My idea is to write\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:38.240\nmainstream television. I mean, at some point, though, you're going to have to... Nope. No. No,\n\n03:38.240 --> 03:44.120\nbecause if I said... If I first meeting at one of these places, if I say, I have this idea,\n\n03:44.120 --> 03:50.120\nthere are these firefighters. They're kind of an unlikely family, but when you join the fire\n\n03:50.120 --> 03:53.720\ndepartment, you're forced to work with other people. Maybe you don't like them so much.\n\n03:53.720 --> 03:58.120\nSounds like you do have an idea. No, I'm saying if I said this, if this was my idea, I don't know.\n\n03:58.120 --> 04:03.160\nThe first thing they're going to say is, I love it, and the second thing they're going to say is,\n\n04:03.160 --> 04:12.040\ncould the firefighters be police? And if I'm really, like, jazzed about the firefighter idea,\n\n04:12.040 --> 04:15.880\nthen I'm going to go, I don't know. I think I should be a firefighter. And they're going to go,\n\n04:15.880 --> 04:24.720\nhmm, difficult. But if I don't care, then I'm going to say, yes, they should be police. You're\n\n04:24.720 --> 04:31.240\nbrilliant. They should be police. They only want one thing. They want you to do a good job\n\n04:31.240 --> 04:37.480\nexecuting the show. The idea is not like, no, I would be, I would be doing a disservice to\n\n04:37.480 --> 04:42.640\ntelevision, sir, if I had an idea already before I even sit down with these people about what these\n\n04:42.640 --> 04:47.360\nshows are going to be about. They're going to be about pickle farmers. They're going to, I changed\n\n04:47.360 --> 04:52.600\nmy mind, they're going to be about rollerbladers. No, no, you know what? Fuck rollerbladers. They're\n\n04:52.600 --> 05:00.720\ngoing to be about human spiders. Unless that's not what they want. I want to see the human spider\n\n05:00.720 --> 05:10.040\nshow. It's weird because they're human, but they're spiders. There's going to be some very,\n\n05:10.040 --> 05:18.160\nvery funny situations that arise from that. You should call it a spider man. No, all right. I like\n\n05:18.160 --> 05:26.200\nit. Spider human. Yeah, Joel, cheers wasn't an idea. That's a, that's a bar. That's what I mean. I\n\n05:26.200 --> 05:32.560\nmean, do you, do you have your, is it a taxi stand? Why not let them handle that? Why is that the\n\n05:32.560 --> 05:38.880\nheart, why not let them say, you know what's hot these days? Slinkies. Hey, you're right. Slinkies\n\n05:38.880 --> 05:42.320\nwith two E's and a Z. That sounds like a good idea. Now I'm making it sound like I'm going to\n\n05:42.320 --> 05:45.720\nwrite something dumb. That's not the point. The point is I'm going to go, I'm going to hoist my\n\n05:45.720 --> 05:51.960\nsails to the wind that's there. Unfortunately, I furnished the rumor mill with a lot of rumors\n\n05:51.960 --> 05:58.000\nabout what a shitty boss I was. I don't, I don't, no, I haven't seen any official like accounts of\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:02.240\nhow bad I was. Do you think that you were a shitty boss though, like by your own standards? Well,\n\n06:02.240 --> 06:06.360\nno, not by my own standards, but the problem is it's an elitist industry. So certainly by the\n\n06:06.360 --> 06:11.240\nstandards of the poor fucker that has to haul a cable down on the set, who's, who would have to\n\n06:11.240 --> 06:16.600\nhaul it, you know, who, like his job is harder. The more I, the more time I take with a script or\n\n06:16.600 --> 06:20.800\nsomething like that. So yeah, by his standards, by, by anybody's standards, who's like, who would\n\n06:20.800 --> 06:26.640\nprefer the schedule work better? You know, yeah, I'm a shitty boss because the, because I take my\n\n06:26.640 --> 06:32.480\ntells my work too seriously. Do you think that you can easily slip from single camera, half hour\n\n06:32.480 --> 06:41.640\ninto a multi camera? No sweat, buddy. Here's the thing, more cameras. It's like, it's like even\n\n06:41.640 --> 06:47.080\nbaseball, you give you can have two bats in your hands. But that's more cable for more sorry fuckers.\n\n06:47.080 --> 06:53.400\nYeah, but they're going to get home by five N word because it, because you're gonna, you know,\n\n06:53.400 --> 06:57.640\nit's you're putting on a little play every week. You can't just say N word, but you know, I think\n\n06:57.640 --> 07:03.320\nthat you're not the people don't know what I mean. They know what you just called me. Yeah, but the\n\n07:03.320 --> 07:07.680\npoint, the point of the N word is not the actual, the word isn't like abracadabra that actually\n\n07:07.680 --> 07:14.200\ncast a magic spell. Can you feel all the eyes burning the back of your head? Our ambassador,\n\n07:14.200 --> 07:19.160\nAfrican American in the front row. Yeah. The only two black people in the building are seated in\n\n07:19.160 --> 07:23.000\nthe front row right now. You're so lucky you sat in the front row because if you were in the back\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:31.360\nor like turning, turning, but, but I said, no, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm right on this one. I don't\n\n07:31.360 --> 07:36.800\nmind like you say the word N word, you mean two things. You know what I mean, culturally, but\n\n07:36.800 --> 07:42.360\nalso if I'm saying it instead of actually saying it, what it means is I respect the idea that it's\n\n07:42.360 --> 07:46.800\nthe, that the word is an insult. You know what I mean? Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah, because\n\n07:46.800 --> 07:51.440\nthe word, don't ask me, ask him. The word is it. Well, I'm not going to ask, I'm also, he's not,\n\n07:51.440 --> 08:00.800\nhe doesn't get to answer for the whole race. That's racism. Fuck him or, or I love you. I don't\n\n08:00.800 --> 08:07.200\nknow. It depends on you. Your individual performance as a human being. That's non-racism is\n\n08:07.200 --> 08:16.200\nwhen we don't know from, like, like, we don't think that he's talking, that he's not the Borg. The,\n\n08:16.200 --> 08:24.560\nthe, but I, like, I, I, I, the problem is the intent behind the word language doesn't, the English\n\n08:24.560 --> 08:28.800\nlanguage is a bunch of sounds that we make. Do you know, like, I went to Montreal, there's a\n\n08:28.800 --> 08:35.320\nbunch of stores there called Couche Tard. To them, it means, I don't know, big savings or\n\n08:35.320 --> 08:40.040\nsomething. I don't know. My sister's retarded. She wouldn't like it. Well, she wouldn't know, but,\n\n08:40.040 --> 08:48.200\nbut Couche Tard is offensive over here to both tards and couches. What's a couche? I don't, well,\n\n08:48.200 --> 08:54.360\nit's, you know, it's what your Scottish friend would call a wizard. We just found out, we have a\n\n08:54.360 --> 09:00.720\nScottish friend, we just found out that a slang term for vagina is wizard sleeve. Wizard sleeve. I\n\n09:00.720 --> 09:06.400\nthought she said wizard. I was like, that's the first great word for a vagina, like a first, like,\n\n09:06.400 --> 09:14.000\nthat's so respectful. I was like, like, like this, this oracle of, like, you're going to it for\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:20.120\ninstruction and enchantment. But, but it, but to me, to me, like, I mean, men are visual thinkers.\n\n09:20.120 --> 09:26.280\nIt conjures up a wizened old dude with a, with a beard on a robe. That makes you a hero. I, like,\n\n09:26.280 --> 09:29.800\nthat tells you when you're doing it right, when you're doing it wrong. That has all the power. I,\n\n09:29.800 --> 09:37.000\nI, I am calling Pussy's wizards from now on. I think that's fucking beautiful. I, I, sleeve is\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:44.520\ngross. Like, envelope, wallet, any object, like, a sheath. Yeah, obviously, what you're saying is\n\n09:44.520 --> 09:50.400\nit's an object and that's no good. I, we stumbled onto it on accident. Call it a wizard. And if\n\n09:50.400 --> 09:57.560\nit's really fucking nice and you really love the woman, call it Merlin. Man, I was with Tabitha\n\n09:57.560 --> 10:03.720\nthe last night. She's got a fucking straight up Merlin, bro. Man, but I was out with, I was out\n\n10:03.720 --> 10:12.280\nwith Tabitha and she's got a Voldemort man. Right? Was that a wizard? I don't know. Yeah, but I think\n\n10:12.280 --> 10:16.960\na good one, isn't it? I don't know. It's a Voldemort good or bad. He's bad. Okay. A guy, a guy went\n\n10:16.960 --> 10:22.200\nlike this, he gave a thumbs down. This was being shot like a multi-camera thing, like with the\n\n10:22.200 --> 10:26.160\naudience, like, if it was like, who's lying to them, they would use you. They would cut you would\n\n10:26.160 --> 10:31.640\nbe on TV because you gave a thumbs down and he said, it's bad. Voldemort's bad. The editors would\n\n10:31.640 --> 10:36.200\nbe like, oh, I like him. I like him. See, I thought he was giving me the thumbs down because that\n\n10:36.200 --> 10:41.480\nwas not a funny enough reference. No, no, no, he's just fucking immersed. Voldemort's bad. The price\n\n10:41.480 --> 10:47.880\nis right. Is there a funnier bad wizard than Voldemort? It has to be. Who else is a bad wizard?\n\n10:47.880 --> 10:58.560\nZoran is good. Zoran. Zoran, the gay wizard. The gay wand. Anyways, I think that's beautiful. The\n\n10:58.560 --> 11:05.080\nwizard. The wizard. Baby, I'm going to go to town on your wizard tonight. I want to have sex more\n\n11:05.080 --> 11:11.520\nthan I did before. I want to talk about the wizard. I want to see your wizard. I want to go to your\n\n11:11.520 --> 11:18.120\nwizard. I want to become a hero. Anyways, so I don't know if it's worth getting back to the n-word\n\n11:18.120 --> 11:23.080\nroot of that tangent, but... Oh, it's worth it. The English language, like any language, is just a\n\n11:23.080 --> 11:29.880\nbunch of sounds we make to make ourselves clear. The intent behind the words we use, and it's a\n\n11:29.880 --> 11:34.800\nbeautiful thing that we're able to discern intent from language. That's the miracle. It's the intent\n\n11:34.800 --> 11:40.920\nthat you want to police. You want to know whether or not someone is actually racist, not whether\n\n11:40.920 --> 11:46.440\nthey said a combination of words that's technically racist. When you fall into that game, guess who's\n\n11:46.440 --> 11:52.160\nreally good at it? A bunch of fucking lying, shitty, racist fuckers. That's who's really good at it.\n\n11:52.160 --> 11:58.920\nLike, look how many... As soon as they caught on to the idea that we were figuring out that bad\n\n11:58.920 --> 12:06.400\npeople are racist, like all genuinely racist, shitty, evil people do is they just put Condoleezza\n\n12:06.400 --> 12:11.080\nRice next to them, and they go like, this makes me a good person, right? According to your definition,\n\n12:11.080 --> 12:16.440\ndon't give them that power by like being hung up on technicalities. The idea of non-racism is that\n\n12:16.440 --> 12:22.640\nthe race doesn't matter, period, doesn't matter. Is that dumb tangent? Now I've turned into Lenny\n\n12:22.640 --> 12:33.760\nBruce. Anyways, I like to... I say n-word, you know what I mean. Dan and I, we don't do it as much as\n\n12:33.760 --> 12:40.000\nwe used to, but lots of times at parties, via Dan's or my place or someone else's place, we would\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:45.640\nstart freestyle rapping. You know, like some white dudes just freestyle rapping, and you know, we do\n\n12:45.640 --> 12:51.240\nimprov, so we kind of fancy ourselves, you know, good to varying degrees. Yeah, it's hard to do\n\n12:51.240 --> 12:58.640\nfreestyle rap without... You don't say n-word then, you use the n-word. And that's always when\n\n12:58.640 --> 13:05.200\ndemorts would walk by. You use the n-word, like people put pepper on their salad. I fucking love\n\n13:05.200 --> 13:13.480\nit. And rap, that word is fucking delicious. It's like fucking licorice. We're kind of licorice.\n\n13:13.480 --> 13:22.240\nN-word-ish licorice. If I was able to say it, there'd be a fucking awesome rhyme. We read some\n\n13:22.240 --> 13:29.240\npart of it, and we're all going around in a circle, like, okay, it's talking about bacon bits. Bacon bits, rap. Yeah.\n\n13:29.240 --> 13:35.240\nIt's salty and brown, and you go, I want it around, put it on your salad, and n-word makes it... I don't know.\n\n13:35.240 --> 13:44.720\nIt's just fun, it's fucking, it's a go-to. It's like popping the plastic bubbles in the packing. If you're\n\n13:44.720 --> 13:49.800\nfreestyling, I mean, for better or for worse. But our friend Demorge would walk by right when you\n\n13:49.800 --> 13:57.240\nsaid it. Demorge always knew when I was going to say the n-word. Because you were rapping. Yeah, he was\n\n13:57.240 --> 14:03.760\nlike, I'm going to go check that out. And that's what he sounds like. I'm not being racist. He has a\n\n14:03.760 --> 14:12.120\ndeeper voice than me. A very masculine... How about every time a Johnny Cash song comes on? Well, that's\n\n14:12.120 --> 14:17.880\njust dicks and balls. I would offend gay people way more than before I offended black people. They\n\n14:17.880 --> 14:23.640\ncould hear what I do, what I do in the car. Or maybe not, I don't know. Maybe I don't, because I don't...\n\n14:23.640 --> 14:32.040\nYeah, it's almost like any Johnny Cash song. I put a hundred wieners in my mouth. I put my dick in the\n\n14:32.040 --> 14:42.840\nnorth and in the south. I put my balls and anus in my dick. I suck the balls. I lick the dick. It doesn't...\n\n14:42.840 --> 14:52.800\nIt's so fun. I want to record an album. They love it. They love it. I put wieners in my balls and in my\n\n14:52.800 --> 15:01.760\nnuts. I put my dick in my anus as a butt. The fact that nuts rhymes with butts, by the way, is a fucking\n\n15:01.760 --> 15:06.800\ngodsend. That's amazing. Money in the bank. The only thing that rhymes with mouth is south. You're\n\n15:06.800 --> 15:10.640\nfucked. As soon as you say mouth, Jeff starts rolling his eyes like, I guess something's going to be\n\n15:10.640 --> 15:19.640\nsouth next. But fucking nuts and butts. Like candies and nuts. That's fucking great for Johnny Cash\n\n15:19.640 --> 15:24.800\nriffing. I'm telling you, listen to any Johnny Cash song, and just start tapping your foot and just fucking\n\n15:24.800 --> 15:27.640\ngo for it. You don't have to be clever. Just talk about...\n\n15:27.640 --> 15:43.640\nI'm not as familiar with this song, but it'll probably work. I'll start. I see your wiener coming. It's\n\n15:43.640 --> 15:51.200\ncoming in my mouth. I've sucked in every direction from the north and to the south. Then I put your\n\n15:51.200 --> 16:05.200\nballs inside me and shoved them in my butt. I got sent to Folsom Prison for licking dicks and nuts.\n\n16:05.200 --> 16:30.200\nYou take this one. Come on, Jeff. We'll go back and forth. Forget when he starts.\n\n16:30.200 --> 16:40.200\nI put my neck inside my mama's ear. I put my shoe inside. You hear it if she's queer. And if she's\n\n16:40.200 --> 16:53.200\nthere, I say, come over here because she's gay. I fuck her ear. Everybody! See, that came off as\n\n16:53.200 --> 17:06.200\nanti-grandma. I want to record an album called Getting It Out of My System. You should see my\n\n17:06.200 --> 17:11.200\ngirlfriend's eyes roll. It's like, Jesus Christ, when are you going to get tired of that? I don't know,\n\n17:11.200 --> 17:19.200\nman. Dicks and balls and nuts and butts. I can't stop. You never talk about, you don't like being\n\n17:19.200 --> 17:23.200\nalone and do you talk to yourself and you say you kind of mutter to yourself. When I'm alone at home,\n\n17:23.200 --> 17:28.200\nI don't know if I share this with any of you out there. I live alone. I haven't had a girlfriend in\n\n17:28.200 --> 17:34.200\na thousand years. I'm a bachelor. I'm always either nude or in my underwear and I'm singing. I'm\n\n17:34.200 --> 17:40.200\nrapping, I'm singing, I'm dancing and it's so stupid and I play a game with myself. Can I embarrass\n\n17:40.200 --> 17:47.200\nmyself? Can I get up to go make a sandwich from my couch and do a dance that even I go, dude, come on.\n\n17:47.200 --> 17:52.200\nAnd I can. It is possible to embarrass myself. And as I told you last week, I can't do it so that's why\n\n17:52.200 --> 17:57.200\nI have a girlfriend. I keep her around because you reminded me, I pulled this up. I want to see Jesus\n\n17:57.200 --> 18:05.200\nChrist Superstar with Aaron in New York and there's a song in there that's like, why should you want\n\n18:05.200 --> 18:13.200\nto know? Don't you know about the future? That song. It was so locked in my head. Jesus Christ Superstar\n\n18:13.200 --> 18:19.200\nis filled with these infectiously catchy, earworm songs and you can't stop. If you've never seen it,\n\n18:19.200 --> 18:24.200\nI swear it's the most obnoxious thing. It's the first time you watch Jesus Christ Superstar for the next\n\n18:24.200 --> 18:29.200\nthree weeks. Your friends are going to hate you unless they're on the same mushroom and doing it with\n\n18:29.200 --> 18:35.200\nyou. You're just going to be humming these songs and stuff. And I got re-initiated into it and I wrote\n\n18:35.200 --> 18:41.200\nthis down. This is how pathetic I am because I was like, I'm really onto something here. Why put\n\n18:41.200 --> 18:51.200\nwieners in your butt? Don't you know your butt's for pooping? You got to keep the dicks outside. If you\n\n18:51.200 --> 19:01.200\nuse your butt for wieners, you're going to make it get too wide. I have one that I created on the\n\n19:01.200 --> 19:13.200\ntour bus. Stuck in you. I got my penis so deep in your hole, now my dick's in your shoe. That's a\n\n19:13.200 --> 19:23.200\nlong, long way. That is a long way. Lionel's right. Alternate timeline Lionel Richie is right about\n\n19:23.200 --> 19:26.200\nthat. That's a long way when your dick's in the shoe. I thought you were going to do the Pringles\n\n19:26.200 --> 19:34.200\nthing. We've done Pringles Dicks before. For the nation. Has anyone heard the Pringles Dicks song\n\n19:34.200 --> 19:41.200\nhere before? On the tour bus, I don't know if you guys have ever been on the road, taking a road\n\n19:41.200 --> 19:46.200\ntrip. I've traveled around with some comedians and we do a thing. For some reason, our tour manager\n\n19:46.200 --> 19:51.200\ninsists on Pringles. I don't know that any of us truly love Pringles, but they're there. They're\n\n19:51.200 --> 19:59.200\nubiquitous. I picked up a tin of Pringles. The full tennis ball sized canister of Pringles. I held it\n\n19:59.200 --> 20:05.200\nto my dick. You want to sing it with me? No, you do it. Come on. Take your fun. I sit with a Pringles\n\n20:05.200 --> 20:10.200\ndick in my lap like it's a big hard-on, yeah. Some people call me Pringles dick, but I never really\n\n20:10.200 --> 20:18.200\nfound out why. I don't really have a Pringles dick. I just keep my dick inside. I keep my dick\n\n20:18.200 --> 20:25.200\ninside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis warm and dry. Some people call me Pringles dick, but\n\n20:25.200 --> 20:30.200\nI never really found out. No, I never found out. I never really found out why.\n\n20:37.200 --> 20:43.200\nIt's really satisfying. We have a deep abiding passion for making up songs. We were talking weeks\n\n20:43.200 --> 20:48.200\nago about how we miss golfing. We were golfing nine holes. That makes it sound like a bunch of rich\n\n20:48.200 --> 20:53.200\ntwats. No, it's that shitty one in Waterville. Part three cars that cost five bucks. Everyone should\n\n20:53.200 --> 20:58.200\ngo golfing. It's a good exercise, whatever. I'm not going to sell it. Fuck you. I am a rich\n\n20:58.200 --> 21:04.200\ntwat. I was golfing with Jeff and we spent all nine holes the entire time. It just takes like\n\n21:04.200 --> 21:14.200\nan hour and a half or something. We got obsessed. We started singing the Nightcourt theme, which is like...\n\n21:14.200 --> 21:21.200\nA lot of you will be lost by this because you don't have that Nightcourt theme locked in your\n\n21:21.200 --> 21:28.200\nhead. I started riffing lyrics to it and then we got obsessed. We got it fucking syllabically\n\n21:28.200 --> 21:34.200\nlocked into this perfect Rubik's Cube. It has to sound exactly like the theme to Nightcourt's\n\n21:34.200 --> 21:39.200\nlyrics that if the producers of Nightcourt heard it, they would go, that's it. That's perfect.\n\n21:39.200 --> 21:40.200\nNothing ironic.\n\n21:40.200 --> 21:44.200\nDoes anyone here know? Can anyone think of the Nightcourt theme?\n\n21:44.200 --> 21:46.200\nDo you have it clear in your head?\n\n21:46.200 --> 21:48.200\nNo.\n\n21:48.200 --> 21:56.200\nThat was our challenge. We have to come up with Nightcourt lyrics that match it's syllabically\n\n21:56.200 --> 22:01.200\nperfect that are tight, no fucking ums, playing like syllabic games where you're like no repeating\n\n22:01.200 --> 22:05.200\nwords just to fill in a syllable. But also it had to pass muster with the producers of\n\n22:05.200 --> 22:07.200\nNightcourt in our head.\n\n22:07.200 --> 22:11.200\nI think if you and I stay friends until the day we both are dead.\n\n22:11.200 --> 22:13.200\nWe'll never write a more perfect song.\n\n22:13.200 --> 22:17.200\nAnd also I think that was the acme of our friendship. I think you and I have never been\n\n22:17.200 --> 22:18.200\ncloser.\n\n22:18.200 --> 22:21.200\nWe've never been more productive. We've never been more joyful. We've never been more on\n\n22:21.200 --> 22:25.200\nthe same team. I'd like to present to you my theme from Nightcourt because I can't say\n\n22:25.200 --> 22:29.200\nall that and then not do it.\n\n22:29.200 --> 22:51.200\nDays in the courtroom aren't much fun. Come to the Nightcourt, everyone.\n\n22:51.200 --> 23:06.200\nYour frown's on trial. Approach my smile. I sentence you to stay a while.\n\n23:06.200 --> 23:10.200\nAnd we were like just jumping up and down on the knife hole like we did it, we did it,\n\n23:10.200 --> 23:11.200\nwe did it.\n\n23:11.200 --> 23:15.200\nAnd it's like that video game that you know no one can understand your mom comes in and\n\n23:15.200 --> 23:18.200\ngoes why are you getting so frustrated by this thing? Why don't you just cheat or stop\n\n23:18.200 --> 23:24.200\nplaying, then you'd win and you don't understand mom. I gotta collect all my cactus coins.\n\n23:24.200 --> 23:29.200\nMade it up, that's not a reference. There's no game out there with cactus coins.\n\n23:29.200 --> 23:32.200\nThere was the putt one, the too much pepper one too.\n\n23:32.200 --> 23:33.200\nYeah.\n\n23:33.200 --> 23:34.200\nToo much pepper.\n\n23:34.200 --> 23:40.200\nYeah, I hit a putt. I hit it way farther past the hole than I originally was. And I went\n\n23:40.200 --> 23:47.200\ntoo much pepper on the pussy. That's all I had. I just said that. I think there was families\n\n23:47.200 --> 23:51.200\non the adjacent holes.\n\n23:51.200 --> 23:57.200\nAnd I said, not enough salt on the balls. And then we spent the next hour trying to finish\n\n23:57.200 --> 23:58.200\nthe song.\n\n23:58.200 --> 24:03.200\nYeah, but by the eighth hole we had, mama's in the kitchen making titties too, and daddy's\n\n24:03.200 --> 24:05.200\nmaking business calls.\n\n24:05.200 --> 24:08.200\nIt took us a long time.\n\n24:08.200 --> 24:13.200\nI was golfing on that same course that Pitchin put into Belle, and we're all terrible. But\n\n24:13.200 --> 24:18.200\nI hit a ball. It was just the worst shot. And I yelled the C word while we're at it.\n\n24:18.200 --> 24:24.200\nI just went, can't. And I look over and there's a father on a green right like 20 yards away\n\n24:24.200 --> 24:28.200\nfrom me with two like young boys, just like staring at me. The boys don't know what it\n\n24:28.200 --> 24:38.200\nis, but the father was giving me a look like, what are you doing? And I went, I can't golf.\n\n24:38.200 --> 24:46.200\nI was up all night in a wizard's sleeve. I can't golf.\n\n24:46.200 --> 24:48.200\nWell, good save.\n\n24:48.200 --> 24:52.200\nHe didn't buy it for a second.\n\n24:52.200 --> 24:58.200\nI sacrificed my entire literary career as in books by doing this, by telling you this,\n\n24:58.200 --> 25:02.200\nbecause there's a very good chance that the guy I had a conversation with on the phone\n\n25:02.200 --> 25:10.200\nwho would have been, if it weren't for me telling you this on a podcast, he would have been\n\n25:10.200 --> 25:16.200\nmy literary agent. He would have maybe introduced me to book publishers. Now he'll hear this\n\n25:16.200 --> 25:20.200\nand go, why are you making fun of me on your thing and fuck you? But I have to tell you\n\n25:20.200 --> 25:24.200\nthis quote. He said it and I couldn't hear the next eight things he said. I was like,\n\n25:24.200 --> 25:30.200\nI'm getting this exactly right because it's amazing what you just said.\n\n25:30.200 --> 25:35.200\nAnd I will preface it by saying, if he is listening, it's not like I think that you're\n\n25:35.200 --> 25:38.200\nan asshole or stupid or anything. It's just what you said was fucking amazing and had\n\n25:38.200 --> 25:43.200\nto be put under glass, like the Declaration of Independence, only it's a declaration of\n\n25:43.200 --> 25:44.200\nmeaninglessness.\n\n25:44.200 --> 25:47.200\nWas this a prepared statement that you think he said?\n\n25:47.200 --> 25:50.200\nNo, he was finding words. He's just talking. He's just talking. And this is amazing how\n\n25:50.200 --> 25:54.200\nwhat the human brain can come up with when you're just talking. Because he was explaining\n\n25:54.200 --> 25:58.200\nthe current market out there. I was explaining what kind of books I would write if I could\n\n25:58.200 --> 26:04.200\nread a book and what kind of idea would be more sellable than another. And he was explaining\n\n26:04.200 --> 26:11.200\nthe book marketplace to me and he said, you know, we are living in a world of extreme\n\n26:11.200 --> 26:17.200\ncaution, except in cases where caution goes out the window in which case things can become\n\n26:17.200 --> 26:34.200\nquite reckless. That is the literary market in a nutshell.\n\n26:34.200 --> 26:41.200\nI make up words when I'm talking because I don't know what to say. I'm going to string\n\n26:41.200 --> 26:48.200\nthe dots together and they might come out gay, but I don't mean homosexual. I don't want\n\n26:48.200 --> 27:04.200\nto offend anyone. I mean gay like it was retarded. There I go, gun. There you go, gun.\n\n27:04.200 --> 27:14.200\nBy the way, my sister is retarded. Chiching. A comedic chiching.\n\n27:14.200 --> 27:17.200\nNow was there a discussion after he said that?\n\n27:17.200 --> 27:25.200\nNo, maybe he heard my thumbs rattling on my iPhone. He was probably telling me to cure\n\n27:25.200 --> 27:29.200\nfor cancer. I was like, give me, get this right before it seeps out of my 39 year old\n\n27:29.200 --> 27:37.200\nbrain. Fred Wellard much? I was out of town. I missed the news. Well no one was there.\n\n27:37.200 --> 27:42.200\nOr he wouldn't have done it. What do you mean you were out of town? We were all out of town.\n\n27:42.200 --> 27:48.200\nI'm saying I had nothing to do with it. I was not around the TV or newspaper or anything.\n\n27:48.200 --> 27:52.200\nI only bring it up because I want to talk about how insane it is that people are still bothering\n\n27:52.200 --> 27:59.200\nto arrest people. What were the details of the actual case?\n\n27:59.200 --> 28:07.200\nIf anyone's buying admission to your porno theater, they're obviously just a pre-internet\n\n28:07.200 --> 28:13.200\nperson that wants to jerk off. Leave them alone. The idea, okay, here's the thing. If there's\n\n28:13.200 --> 28:18.200\na law, if there's a statute, if there's a bylaw regarding what we do with our penises\n\n28:18.200 --> 28:25.200\nin public, it's probably well founded in some pre-internet history though. The idea behind\n\n28:25.200 --> 28:32.200\nthe first person to say, you can't jerk off in a movie theater, there's a leprechaun.\n\n28:32.200 --> 28:45.200\nIt was Sheriff O. Johnson. The idea of that was these movie theaters are so new and the\n\n28:45.200 --> 28:50.200\nwomen's titties are so big on the screen, everyone wants to just jerk off everywhere.\n\n28:50.200 --> 28:55.200\nIf we don't put a cork in this, it's going to spread to the streets. That's not a risk\n\n28:55.200 --> 29:00.200\nanymore. These are like elephant graveyards. The only thing that's going to happen in there\n\n29:00.200 --> 29:05.200\nis a couple people that are left that don't have laptops just like jerking off. Who cares?\n\n29:05.200 --> 29:09.200\nLeave them alone. I've never been inside one of those establishments, but it seems to me\n\n29:09.200 --> 29:16.200\nthat if I walked in there, I would see five or six guys jerking off. Why are you getting\n\n29:16.200 --> 29:21.200\nso high-voiced about it, man? They're not entitled to it, but don't get out of flashlight.\n\n29:21.200 --> 29:28.200\nWhat do you think you're going to find out is happening? What are you looking for? A\n\n29:28.200 --> 29:34.200\nguy writing his thesis? What are you trying to dig up and look at the business you're\n\n29:34.200 --> 29:40.200\nengaged in? Terrible. Has it been proven? I don't know anything. I'm basing on one of\n\n29:40.200 --> 29:44.200\nthese comics. I just heard a thing in the lobby, and I have no idea what actually happened.\n\n29:44.200 --> 29:49.200\nWhat I do know is that apparently the only way it came to my attention was on Twitter\n\n29:49.200 --> 29:54.200\nand everybody coming to us rescued. Nobody wants to fuck with Fred Willard. He's hilarious.\n\n29:54.200 --> 30:00.200\nAlso, there's a victimless crime. Even more than a victimless crime, he was making at\n\n30:00.200 --> 30:06.200\nleast one person happy if he was doing that. We need more of that. Go pick on somebody who's\n\n30:06.200 --> 30:12.200\ndoing something wrong to anybody. Anyways, I'm probably what I'm probably doing is contributing\n\n30:12.200 --> 30:20.200\nto the problem because of probably the story. I didn't actually research it. But then again,\n\n30:20.200 --> 30:27.200\nif I did, all I'd be reading is a bunch of... I was acquainted with this process. There's\n\n30:27.200 --> 30:32.200\na Chinese telephone that happens online, and now I'll be quoted as saying that Chinese\n\n30:32.200 --> 30:40.200\npeople are bad at making telephones. It's like the blogs, they just quote each other\n\n30:40.200 --> 30:46.200\nnow. They're gone are the days of confirming things, talking to three different sources\n\n30:46.200 --> 30:51.200\nindependently. There's no journalism left. There's just like, this is just in. Something\n\n30:51.200 --> 30:58.200\nis just in over there. It can get pretty fucking nuts pretty fast. For all I know, Fred Willard\n\n30:58.200 --> 31:06.200\ndid absolutely nothing. He probably ate a piece of popcorn. On the off chance that he was\n\n31:06.200 --> 31:11.200\njerking off, I am also on his side. I would say if I saw Fred Willard or me or you or\n\n31:11.200 --> 31:16.200\nanybody in this room walking into one of those theaters at 2 p.m., I would think that person\n\n31:16.200 --> 31:22.200\nwould go, jerk off. And if it was Fred Willard, I'd offer to let him come on my face. Now\n\n31:22.200 --> 31:32.200\nwe're getting some. Because he's amazing. Whatever. Jerking off, monkeys do it. They\n\n31:32.200 --> 31:40.200\ndo it with frogs' mouths. What's that one monkey? Everyone's just fucking everybody.\n\n31:40.200 --> 31:47.200\nIt's straight. It's gay. The bonobo chimp are closest genetic relative. The bonobo chimpanzee.\n\n31:47.200 --> 31:53.200\nFor a long time, scientists just ignored the fact that the bonobo chimp out of all the\n\n31:53.200 --> 31:59.200\nvarieties of chimps, chimps are 99% identical to us genetically. The bonobo chimp is 99\n\n31:59.200 --> 32:04.200\npoint something. It's as close as you can get to human while staying at chimpanzee. It's\n\n32:04.200 --> 32:11.200\nour closest relative. And they do nothing but fucking jerk off. They have incest. They\n\n32:11.200 --> 32:17.200\nhave gang bangs. They have gang wars. And then they settle the gang disputes by everybody\n\n32:17.200 --> 32:23.200\nfucking each other. Sisters and brothers and moms and uncles and fucking. And if you got\n\n32:23.200 --> 32:29.200\nnothing to do, you're just jerking it. These are horrible. By our standards, it's like,\n\n32:29.200 --> 32:33.200\nthis is why the human race needs to give itself a break. We didn't invent anything that makes\n\n32:33.200 --> 32:40.200\nus unseemly. We didn't invent assassination, lying, war, anything. The only thing that\n\n32:40.200 --> 32:44.200\nmakes humans different from all of our primate cousins is compassion. That's the one thing\n\n32:44.200 --> 32:48.200\nthat we bring to the table that's brand new. We bring the concept that we actually kind\n\n32:48.200 --> 32:52.200\nof like each other and would even sometimes take a bullet for each other. That's our\n\n32:52.200 --> 32:58.200\nthing. That's what humanity is. All the stuff that we think is like original sin and\n\n32:58.200 --> 33:03.200\nall this stuff. It was invented by squirrel creatures that came before us. They started\n\n33:03.200 --> 33:08.200\nlying to each other with their faces. The first thing that happened is things that were\n\n33:08.200 --> 33:13.200\nclimbing in trees, these mammals, they developed stereoscopic color vision because it helped\n\n33:13.200 --> 33:19.200\nthem, number one, jump from branch to branch. Our eyes face forward, like 3D. So you can\n\n33:19.200 --> 33:25.200\nsee in 3D. Unlike dogs and turtles and shit, you have depth perception. So you can jump\n\n33:25.200 --> 33:30.200\nfrom a branch to a branch. Then the other thing is, meanwhile, color vision. Why? Fruit.\n\n33:30.200 --> 33:36.200\nSo you can tell the fruit's rotten or what the good stuff is. So with all of that, then\n\n33:36.200 --> 33:39.200\nthe hair starts falling away from the face because what's happening at the same time\n\n33:39.200 --> 33:46.200\nis socially, sexually, politically, these primates as they became, they start communicating\n\n33:46.200 --> 33:51.200\nwith each other with these new pieces of equipment, these state-of-the-art eyes that can see in\n\n33:51.200 --> 33:58.200\nvivid color and just maximum resolution. So the hair comes away from the face and our\n\n33:58.200 --> 34:02.200\nmusculature and our faces becomes incredibly overdeveloped so we can make all these weird\n\n34:02.200 --> 34:06.200\nfaces. Way before we could talk, way before we could do any of that, we were lying to\n\n34:06.200 --> 34:11.200\neach other by winking and squinting and smiling. These little squirrel-like creatures, even\n\n34:11.200 --> 34:18.200\nbefore they were monkeys, they were starting to do that shit. You can leverage your fellow\n\n34:18.200 --> 34:23.200\nprimate by going, hey, that guy likes you over there, not as much as she does. She says\n\n34:23.200 --> 34:27.200\nweird shit about you, but I don't agree. Everyone's fucking with each other because it means the\n\n34:27.200 --> 34:34.200\ndifference between life and death. They invented that shit, not us. We inherited it. We don't\n\n34:34.200 --> 34:40.200\nhave to be bad people to each other. Humanity does not give itself a break. Speaking of\n\n34:40.200 --> 34:45.200\nbreaks, some of you may have been here two weeks ago and my lovely girlfriend, the love\n\n34:45.200 --> 34:51.200\nof my life, Erin McGathy, was a guest comp-troller. You can applaud for her, I guess, but that\n\n34:51.200 --> 34:56.200\nmeans nothing now that I asked you to. I don't have her back or anything. If you guys ask\n\n34:56.200 --> 35:05.200\nme to, I'll sell her out in a second. Erin is funnier than me, smarter than me. Don't\n\n35:05.200 --> 35:10.200\nhold that against her or anything and don't try to prove that that's not the case. But\n\n35:10.200 --> 35:17.200\nshe and Jeff are like beta fish. They both love me very much. One of their primary points\n\n35:17.200 --> 35:27.200\nof contention is we like to have game nights and Erin likes to explain and run games. Some\n\n35:27.200 --> 35:35.200\nof you even in this audience have been back to my place, Danadoo, where we'll play catchphrase\n\n35:35.200 --> 35:41.200\nor apples to apples or celebrity. Erin, thankfully, because I don't want to do it, she always\n\n35:41.200 --> 35:49.200\nsteps up and wants to control the game. Jeff and her had an evening once where it was very\n\n35:49.200 --> 35:56.200\nuncomfortable for me and that's what matters. Erin was trying to explain the game of catchphrase.\n\n35:56.200 --> 36:06.200\nFor 45 minutes. Conservatively, 40 minutes. People were peeing their pants.\n\n36:06.200 --> 36:11.200\nThen Jeff, after we gave up, people were like, can we just drink and have a fun time? Yeah,\n\n36:11.200 --> 36:18.200\nlet's do it. Then Jeff, as a big fan of efficiency, explained to Erin privately in the corner\n\n36:18.200 --> 36:24.200\nof the party how badly she had done explaining the game for two hours. Not true. Not true.\n\n36:24.200 --> 36:29.200\nYeah, there's a lot of subjectivity. No, it's not true. The important, the objective truth.\n\n36:29.200 --> 36:34.200\nI was going to keep saying it until the behavior changed. The objective truth is that there\n\n36:34.200 --> 36:42.200\nwas a little tender spot there. It was an event. Erin has a great desire to get up and run a game\n\n36:42.200 --> 36:46.200\nnight, which is great. You need someone to do that. If you're game playing people, let's\n\n36:46.200 --> 36:50.200\nall play catchphrase. Let's play apples to apples. Let's play the Leonard Malton movie\n\n36:50.200 --> 36:56.200\ngame. Let's do that. I'd say get on with it. I would say at some point, let's start playing\n\n36:56.200 --> 37:03.200\nthe fucking thing. This was like Nicholas Nicolby, man. It was an eight act play of how to play\n\n37:03.200 --> 37:09.200\na game. Our friend David Butler leans up and goes, it's like $20,000 pyramid except you can't\n\n37:09.200 --> 37:18.200\nuse your hands. I'm like, yeah, yes. I have made my stance on Erin's love of game play\n\n37:18.200 --> 37:25.200\nversus the incredible deficit between her ability to do it functionally. I've gone on record.\n\n37:25.200 --> 37:33.200\nI've been very candid about it. Let's play a new segment in Harmontown. She proposed,\n\n37:33.200 --> 37:37.200\nlet's do a segment. We don't know anything about it other than its title. It's called\n\n37:37.200 --> 37:49.200\nErin McGathy's Game Corner. Do you want to pick a theme song or anything? Let me see what I got.\n\n37:49.200 --> 38:04.200\nSay it again. It's called Erin McGathy's Game Corner.\n\n38:04.200 --> 38:17.200\nThanks for that intro, guys. Super supportive. Really nice.\n\n38:17.200 --> 38:23.200\nThis isn't supposed to be a bit about how I'm bad at explaining games.\n\n38:23.200 --> 38:38.200\nWelcome to Erin McGathy's Game Corner. The two players in tonight's game are Dan Harmon and\n\n38:38.200 --> 38:47.200\nJeff Davis. If we can have them sit in the McGathey Game Corner seats. The game tonight is the\n\n38:47.200 --> 38:55.200\nAnthony game. Everyone plays it all the time. The Anthony game. Is there an Anthony in the\n\n38:55.200 --> 39:07.200\naudience who I interviewed earlier? Anthony, come on down. Let's go to the round of applause for Anthony.\n\n39:07.200 --> 39:13.200\nAlso, is there anybody precocious and in need of some stage time? Right now, just raise your\n\n39:13.200 --> 39:18.200\nhand. Green shirt, you got a smiley face on it. You look cute. That's the guy that gave the\n\n39:18.200 --> 39:31.200\nthumbs down to Dumbledore. Come on down. What is your name, smiley face? Justin.\n\n39:31.200 --> 39:38.200\nTonight's game is the Anthony game. Before the show, I walked out and I saw Anthony in line\n\n39:38.200 --> 39:49.200\nand I interviewed him about his life. The two of you are going to guess, you're going to answer\n\n39:49.200 --> 39:59.200\nquestions about Anthony's life. The first person to 15 points wins the McTrophy. Because my last\n\n39:59.200 --> 40:05.200\nname is McGathey. McTrophy. There are four different categories that you can choose from\n\n40:05.200 --> 40:18.200\nquestion-wise. Love, childhood, personality, and wild. Anthony, before we get started, can you tell\n\n40:18.200 --> 40:25.200\nJeff and Dana, what do you do, Anthony? I'm a PA. Are you a PA for anything right now? No, not\n\n40:25.200 --> 40:30.200\nright now. I mainly work in post-production. What's your favorite sound effect? My favorite sound\n\n40:30.200 --> 40:40.200\neffect? Just do it. I like the slide whistle. Let's hear what it sounds like. Perfect. That's all you\n\n40:40.200 --> 40:51.200\nget to know about Anthony. Welcome to the Anthony game. So Jeff, you're going first. You can choose\n\n40:51.200 --> 40:57.200\nfrom the category love, childhood, personality, or wild. Anthony and his girlfriend have been\n\n40:57.200 --> 41:25.200\ndating for A. False. 15 points. You're a real hero. Anthony and his girlfriend have been dating\n\n41:25.200 --> 41:38.200\nfor A. One year, B. One month, C. He does not currently have a girlfriend. I hate to dog pile. I'm\n\n41:38.200 --> 41:43.200\ngoing to go with C. That is correct. He does not currently have a girlfriend. One point on the\n\n41:43.200 --> 41:51.200\nboard for Jeff Davis. Your best years are ahead of you. Dan Harmon, you may choose from the\n\n41:51.200 --> 42:00.200\ncategory love, childhood, personality, or wild. Personality. Before the show, Anthony described\n\n42:00.200 --> 42:14.200\nhimself as one of the four seasons. He's lying. He's white. Not the band. They're all white. I\n\n42:14.200 --> 42:30.200\nthought you meant the four tops. He's Frankie Valley. Which of the four seasons, winter, spring,\n\n42:30.200 --> 42:41.200\nsummer, or fall, did Anthony describe himself as? Definitely fall. That is correct. He's wearing\n\n42:41.200 --> 42:49.200\nautumnal colors even. He actually has the fall foliage colors. And his eyes are dying. Once\n\n42:49.200 --> 43:00.200\nbeautiful leaves, they're turning. He's falling into Anthony Gay. The game where Anthony gets\n\n43:00.200 --> 43:12.200\nmade fun of. There will only be one loser. There's going to be a cash prize for him, by the\n\n43:12.200 --> 43:24.200\nway. I'll give it to him. Love, childhood, personality, wild. Anthony has A. Never broken\n\n43:24.200 --> 43:34.200\na bone. Or B. Never broken a sweat because he has a sweat gland disorder. Hey. You are\n\n43:34.200 --> 43:46.200\ncorrect. Harmon, love, childhood, personality, wild. Love. His least favorite thing, Anthony's\n\n43:46.200 --> 43:58.200\nleast favorite thing about women, his pet peeve with women, his dates, is A, that they're\n\n43:58.200 --> 44:06.200\noverly controlling. B, that they're overly sensitive. Or C, that they're overly slutty\n\n44:06.200 --> 44:24.200\nbitches. My hook or my crook. He seems like a good kid. Sensitive or controlling. His biggest\n\n44:24.200 --> 44:36.200\ncomplaint about women would be, I would say A, controlling, controlling. Anthony. B. Sensitive.\n\n44:36.200 --> 44:44.200\nIt's extra, whenever we don't get one right, it's like, oh, shit, another question. That\n\n44:44.200 --> 44:51.200\njust added seven minutes to the show. We should start conferring together. We're going to open\n\n44:51.200 --> 44:56.200\nup to the crowd. We're going to get this. The 10 point round. We enter the lightning\n\n44:56.200 --> 45:04.200\nround. Entering the lightning round. Anthony's favorite part of the women's body is A, boobs,\n\n45:04.200 --> 45:12.200\nB, but C, back, D, the top softest part of their head. Legs, legs, legs, legs. Back,\n\n45:12.200 --> 45:23.200\nback, back. It's called the lungs. Anthony's celebrity crush. You have to wait until the\n\n45:23.200 --> 45:28.200\nend of the question. Jennifer Anderson. Is A, Emma Watson, B, Kate Blanchett, C, Kira\n\n45:28.200 --> 45:37.200\nKnightley. Go. Knightley. Watson. Yes, Dan is correct. It's Emma Watson. Anthony was born\n\n45:37.200 --> 45:45.200\nin Denver, raised in A, Miami, B, Boston, C, New Orleans, D, Modesto, E, Cleveland. Jesus\n\n45:45.200 --> 45:59.200\nChrist. D, D, F, A, B, C, F, Modesto, Miami, Boston. They're other ones. Miami, Boston,\n\n45:59.200 --> 46:08.200\nNew Orleans, C, Cleveland. Yes, Jeff is correct. This game has loopholes, Dan. You can just\n\n46:08.200 --> 46:17.200\nsay them all. Remember them all and say them in order. That one was hard because there\n\n46:17.200 --> 46:26.200\nwas 11. That kind of threw us. The human brain remembers seven things. When Jeff does\n\n46:26.200 --> 46:33.200\nT, A hurts my feelings. B makes me feel bad about myself. C makes me feel insecure. All\n\n46:33.200 --> 46:44.200\nright. Here we go. Childhood. Anthony, we're all very, we're friends. I know. Okay. All\n\n46:44.200 --> 46:54.200\nright. Anthony's favorite show. I'm just making fun of you. That's fine. Your bit implies\n\n46:54.200 --> 46:58.200\nthat you would actually prefer if we were very stoic and took it all reason. That would\n\n46:58.200 --> 47:04.200\nbe fucking a horror. Play the game, Herman. You don't want us to take this seriously.\n\n47:04.200 --> 47:09.200\nNo, I don't. Maybe my part of the bit is that I'm reacting to what you're doing.\n\n47:09.200 --> 47:14.200\nAll right. We're all yes-yending each other. It's like Inception, which is my favorite\n\n47:14.200 --> 47:22.200\nmovie. All right. When Dan and I have sex, he, A, makes me wear a tie, B, makes me wear\n\n47:22.200 --> 47:27.200\nboots, D, makes me come here and gel it, D, makes me pretend that I'm controlling a\n\n47:27.200 --> 47:34.200\nshow. No laugh. I'm sorry. That was a bit hard. Dustin, edit that out. All right. Here\n\n47:34.200 --> 47:40.200\nwe go. Anthony's favorite. Leave it in. That stays in the fucking cut. I'm really sorry.\n\n47:40.200 --> 47:49.200\nHalfway done, you guys. Cirque du Soleil is coming out at the break. Anthony's favorite\n\n47:49.200 --> 47:55.200\nshow as a child was, A, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, B, She-Ra, C, Simpsons, B, The New\n\n47:55.200 --> 47:59.200\nKids on the Block cartoon show. Simpsons. New Kids on the Block cartoon show. She-Ra.\n\n47:59.200 --> 48:05.200\nSimpsons is correct. He's not old enough for She-Ra. You dumbass. All right. The first\n\n48:05.200 --> 48:12.200\nperson to describe, sorry, Anthony's sibling situation, like how many brothers and sisters\n\n48:12.200 --> 48:21.200\nare there? Suicide. Will they, won't they? Abject shame. I made up a new word that's\n\n48:21.200 --> 48:28.200\na compound word. Abject shame. All right. I'll take the answer. Who said hot? Me. So I've\n\n48:28.200 --> 48:35.200\ngot 14 points. All right. Final question. Final. But we're tied at 14, right? Final\n\n48:35.200 --> 48:38.200\nquestion. I'm not good at math, but I'm pretty sure we're tied. Justin? This is the final\n\n48:38.200 --> 48:47.200\nquestion. It's worth 80 points. There we go. That's the stuff. Was he brought up A, Methodist,\n\n48:47.200 --> 49:02.200\nB, Baptist, C, Catholic, D, Pentecostal? I know this. My vote, D. What? Pentecostal. Because\n\n49:02.200 --> 49:06.200\nI know one other person from Cleveland. He was Pentecostal. I'm going Pentecostal as well.\n\n49:06.200 --> 49:16.200\nThat is incorrect. I'll give you another chance to pick your answer. Presbyterian. Methodist.\n\n49:16.200 --> 49:25.200\nWhat was the, Baptist? No. I'll say Methodist. I'll say Baptist. Methodist. Catholic. Yes.\n\n49:25.200 --> 49:37.200\nWe did it. All right. Final score. Justin, here, let me get you on the mic. Final score.\n\n49:37.200 --> 49:44.200\nThank you, Aaron. Final score was Dan Four and Jeff 30 million and 11. Let's hear for\n\n49:44.200 --> 49:51.200\nour scorekeeper, Justin. For Anthony, for enduring all of the scrutiny. And also for\n\n49:51.200 --> 50:00.200\nErin McGathy. Erin McGathy's Game Corner. Anthony, I'm giving you a crisp one day of\n\n50:00.200 --> 50:10.200\nPA pay. Yes. That was fucking rough on him. That was rough. Well, yeah, Anthony wants to\n\n50:10.200 --> 50:14.200\nsay something. I think he's entitled. I think that's the best version of a game show about my\n\n50:14.200 --> 50:26.200\nlife that there could be. Jeff just matched the hundred. So Anthony walked away, $200 richer,\n\n50:26.200 --> 50:39.200\njust an irreplaceable piece of his soul shy. I'm sure that's... Did anyone else in here\n\n50:39.200 --> 50:48.200\nsympathize most with me? Just really put yourself in my shoes. Who cares whether she's good\n\n50:48.200 --> 50:56.200\nor bad or whether he's right or wrong? What about me? Put yourself in my shoes in the sitcom\n\n50:56.200 --> 51:04.200\nof my life. These two going at each other. It's a rough life for me. This is happening\n\n51:04.200 --> 51:12.200\nto me. I think she's fantastic. I think you're fantastic too, Jeff. I wish you would just\n\n51:12.200 --> 51:21.200\nfucking get it over with. I think she thinks the same thing about us and...\n\n51:21.200 --> 51:25.200\nNow, Dan, I know that we might have drifted kind of far afield, but tonight we announced\n\n51:25.200 --> 51:30.200\nthat the topic tonight was technology. So let's roll into these technology questions.\n\n51:30.200 --> 51:35.200\nDan Harmon, as a dutiful mayor of Harmontown, went amongst the attendees here, the loyal\n\n51:35.200 --> 51:42.200\nArmenians, and went out and asked people technology questions. I pulled a few out of the bucket\n\n51:42.200 --> 51:44.200\nhere. Would you like me to crack this off, Dan?\n\n51:44.200 --> 51:46.200\nYes, yes, yes. Crack it, crack it.\n\n51:46.200 --> 51:48.200\nIn no particular order. Let's do...\n\n51:48.200 --> 51:55.200\nBy the way, tonight's question round is brought to you by a sponsor. This is what Jeff and\n\n51:55.200 --> 52:00.200\nI decided we were going to do. We're going to break the mold with sponsorship. We're not\n\n52:00.200 --> 52:03.200\ngoing to just do the Adam and Eve spot that you hear on other podcasts. There's like a\n\n52:03.200 --> 52:07.200\ncouple of people who are financing podcasts right now. We're the early days of this new\n\n52:07.200 --> 52:12.200\nmedium, and what's happening is there's a couple of sponsors that are kind of bank-rolling\n\n52:12.200 --> 52:19.200\neverybody. We have overhead. You saw us give a couple of hundreds to Anthony just through\n\n52:19.200 --> 52:26.200\nit, Adam. Destroyed your soul. Here's... I have a hundred, kid. We got that kind of overhead.\n\n52:26.200 --> 52:31.200\nWe're going to hold out. We're not going to do spots for sex toys or whatever you hear\n\n52:31.200 --> 52:39.200\non This Feels Terrible or any of those podcasts, or Marc Maron. Coming for you, bro. We want\n\n52:39.200 --> 52:44.200\nthe big ones. We're going to pioneer. I want Nike. The way we're going to get Nike isn't\n\n52:44.200 --> 52:50.200\ngoing to be by going hat in hand. We're going to do spots for free for fucking Adidas until\n\n52:50.200 --> 53:00.200\nNike begs for mercy. Do you hear that, Nike? Fuck faces? You give us our fucking money,\n\n53:00.200 --> 53:05.200\nor we're going to keep promoting Adidas. You pieces of shit. The tables are turned.\n\n53:05.200 --> 53:11.200\nDan, N-word. I own both Nike and Adidas. I'm wearing Adidas because those Nike people,\n\n53:11.200 --> 53:15.200\nthey just won't fucking pick up the phone. They don't give a shit what people think.\n\n53:15.200 --> 53:24.200\nGeorge Bush and Nike don't give a shit about black people. Adidas, I think they helped\n\n53:24.200 --> 53:30.200\nin Katrina. I didn't do any research, but I'm pretty sure they...\n\n53:30.200 --> 53:34.200\nAdidas flew in a giant shoe and everybody got in it. I'm pretty sure Adidas loves everyone\n\n53:34.200 --> 53:39.200\nof all colors, and I'm wearing the shoes to prove it. This run is brought to you by Adidas,\n\n53:39.200 --> 53:49.200\nNike. Harmon, let's see here. I like TV. I like the internet someone posits. Does\n\n53:49.200 --> 53:58.200\ninternet hurt TV overall? Yeah. All right, next question. Shit. You see Aaron, it can\n\n53:58.200 --> 54:09.200\nbe done. There's a lot of robot questions. I want to get to some robot questions here.\n\n54:09.200 --> 54:18.200\nHere's one I liked a lot. Is the singularity nigh, and if so, how will it affect my sex\n\n54:18.200 --> 54:26.200\nlife, be as specific as possible? Is the physical singularity, the possible of all mass\n\n54:26.200 --> 54:34.200\nand matter in the universe, re-coalescing into one infinitely dense point? That's the opposite\n\n54:34.200 --> 54:38.200\nof the Big Bang, right? No, is that what... Wait, so come up here, sir. Come up here. Tell\n\n54:38.200 --> 54:44.200\nus what the singularity is, just to... Is it a sitcom? I just watched Terminator,\n\n54:44.200 --> 54:52.200\nSarah Connor Chronicles, and they defined it. Come on, robots. Become so smart that they\n\n54:52.200 --> 54:58.200\ncan replicate themselves with smarter versions of robots. That's what they said.\n\n54:58.200 --> 55:06.200\nAll right. Is that... Can I get a second nerd pinion? All right, you come up here. This\n\n55:06.200 --> 55:13.200\nguy's got a shirt on that says, God is a Moog. You're not a musician. It's okay. So\n\n55:13.200 --> 55:18.200\ntechnological singularity, when technology becomes so advanced that it exceeds human\n\n55:18.200 --> 55:29.200\nintelligence. Like Skynet. Yeah, like Skynet. You guys are not enemies of each other. The\n\n55:29.200 --> 55:33.200\nsingularity does come. They're going to drive a wedge between you. You're going to be in\n\n55:33.200 --> 55:42.200\nthe same trench, using dogs to detect rubber people. Get along. Raise your standards. Lower\n\n55:42.200 --> 55:51.200\nthem. All right. No, the singularity is not nigh because of capitalism. You can't make\n\n55:51.200 --> 55:57.200\na fucking flash drive that works on two computers in the same day. We are a long ways. We have\n\n55:57.200 --> 56:01.200\nto have a complete societal collapse before we're able to make technology that actually\n\n56:01.200 --> 56:07.200\nfunctions in a cohesive way. We're still trying to figure out... We're all caught up. We have\n\n56:07.200 --> 56:11.200\nso much technology right now. We could make anything we wanted. We have the technology\n\n56:11.200 --> 56:16.200\nto make like a robot dude that would walk around in high five everybody. We just can't do it\n\n56:16.200 --> 56:21.200\nbecause the Sony says, well, it should have a memory stick in it. And then Microsoft is\n\n56:21.200 --> 56:28.200\ngoing, I think it should have a micro bead. All right, Harmon. Another question. What\n\n56:28.200 --> 56:34.200\nfictional piece of technology would you most like to see in real life? For example, hover\n\n56:34.200 --> 56:38.200\nboards, they say. What fictional piece of technology would you like to see in real life?\n\n56:38.200 --> 56:42.200\nRight, right, right. Oh, that's great. That's fucking great. That's so great it'll destroy\n\n56:42.200 --> 56:46.200\nthe show because I have to think about it so long. It's like asking a fat kid what kind\n\n56:46.200 --> 56:57.200\nof hot dog. Because I'm going to go with wizard sleeve. Hey, that exists, man. It's right down\n\n56:57.200 --> 57:10.200\nthe street. I'm torn between... I want virtual reality on a level where the video games are\n\n57:10.200 --> 57:18.200\njust like holodeck, holodeck. I want to be able to simulate fictional realities. That's\n\n57:18.200 --> 57:23.200\nthe fictional science that I want more than anything. Because teleportation, all you're\n\n57:23.200 --> 57:30.200\ngoing to be able to do is go to Afghanistan really fast. It's still shitty there. I want\n\n57:30.200 --> 57:38.200\nvideo games to be so good that I don't care that Afghanis are outside my door. They're\n\n57:38.200 --> 57:45.200\nreally very upset. I want to spend the last years of my life pretending I'm Sherlock Holmes\n\n57:45.200 --> 57:56.200\nand solving the case of the missing pussy. Easiest case to solve in my version. I'm knee\n\n57:56.200 --> 58:14.200\ndeep in it. Elementary, my dear Watson. Dan, what rights do robots have? Three. Robots\n\n58:14.200 --> 58:21.200\ndon't have rights. This is a popular thing in fictional... We look forward to this day\n\n58:21.200 --> 58:25.200\nas a singularity issue too. We're going to eventually create life. This is what humans\n\n58:25.200 --> 58:30.200\ndo. The mythology I think is very interesting. I believe... I think Joseph Campbell hinted\n\n58:30.200 --> 58:38.200\nat this. Props, Joey. I read a book, one of Joseph Campbell's books. He referred to the\n\n58:38.200 --> 58:45.200\nlock-and-tumbler type of instinct. There's another type of instinct, which is an open-ended\n\n58:45.200 --> 58:54.200\ninstinct. An example of that is a species of moth that they studied where they noticed\n\n58:54.200 --> 59:02.200\nthat the female of the species had a certain shade color of their wings. The males preferred\n\n59:02.200 --> 59:09.200\nthe ladies that had a darker shade. They made an unreasonably dark-winged moth that was\n\n59:09.200 --> 59:16.200\njust a fake moth, a Jessica Rabbit moth. The male moths wouldn't even... At the detriment\n\n59:16.200 --> 59:21.200\nof their own species, you could put a real live moth in a cage with this other moth and\n\n59:21.200 --> 59:26.200\nyou just put this fake-ass Jessica Rabbit moth in there. The male moth would just hump\n\n59:26.200 --> 59:31.200\nthis fucking piece of cardboard because it was darker even though it wasn't even possible\n\n59:31.200 --> 59:38.200\nto see it. Campbell refers to this open-ended instinct. Some organisms are capable of thinking...\n\n59:38.200 --> 59:43.200\nHere's a great example of lock-and-tumbler, just to contrast it more. I find this shit\n\n59:43.200 --> 59:49.200\nso fascinating. There are chicks, baby chicks. There's a species of hawk that fly over chicken\n\n59:49.200 --> 59:59.200\ncoops. Chicks, when they see its silhouette in the sky, they'll head for cover. They made\n\n59:59.200 --> 01:00:03.200\na model of a hawk and they ran it over the chicken coop. The chicks run for cover. Then\n\n01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:08.200\nthey ran it over backwards and the chicks didn't run for cover because it wasn't the exact\n\n01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:13.200\nimage that the chick needs to see to make it run for cover. It was flying backwards.\n\n01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.200\nA newborn chick, just born with a script that it was running. If it doesn't fit the cue\n\n01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.200\nexactly, then the chick doesn't engage in the behavior instinctively. Contrast that with\n\n01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:31.200\na moth that wants to fuck the darker chick the better. Humanity's mythology is an open-ended\n\n01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:36.200\ninstinct for the behavior that we want to emulate. We have a blueprint on our nervous\n\n01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:43.200\nsystem. We know the qualities that a perfect being possesses. Our gods are the things that\n\n01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.200\nwe want to become. We know that our job is to cheat death. We know that it's to populate\n\n01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:53.200\nthe universe. We know that we need to create life. Look at what we do to ourselves in the\n\n01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.200\npursuit of perfection. Our perfection has nothing to do with ourselves. We kill ourselves.\n\n01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:03.200\nWe literally kill each other and ourselves. A plane goes down and we don't make planes illegal.\n\n01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.200\nWe go, 500 people. Fuck it. I hope tomorrow's better, but we gotta fucking do some shit.\n\n01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:13.200\nWe gotta get on the moon. We have an open-ended instinct for perfecting ourselves. One of\n\n01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.200\nthose things is we are absolutely obsessed, obsessed with, you see that you Google it\n\n01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:23.200\nand it's just like these Japanese robot legs. We almost got it. We almost got it. We can\n\n01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.200\nmake a fucking weird thing go up the stairs and it unsettles us. We're almost there. We\n\n01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:33.200\nwant to make people. We want to make ourselves and we will do it. We're going to fuck ourselves\n\n01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.200\nover. They're going to murder us. They will. That's the singularity. I didn't know there\n\n01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.200\nwas a word for it, but they're going to fucking kill us because they're going to be better\n\n01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.200\nthan us and we're going to be happy to die. Somebody told me once, it was Stephen Notley,\n\n01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:53.200\nthe creator of Bob the Angry Flower, the only Canadian I've ever liked. That's going to\n\n01:01:53.200 --> 01:02:01.200\ncost me a couple listeners. Take that, North America. Take that half of the English-speaking\n\n01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:11.200\ncontinent. He and I were talking science one night. He's a huge awesome nerd. He was talking\n\n01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:15.200\nabout this thing that he read about the idea that information is the only thing that's\n\n01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:22.200\nevolving and that humans are the patsy, that genetically passed information. Humans inventing\n\n01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:29.200\ncomputers represents us passing on the ability to store more information in a more compact\n\n01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.200\nspace than the universe was able to assemble on its own using just these kind of molecules\n\n01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:39.200\nthat are in our cells. We've gotten to the point where these cells in our bodies are just\n\n01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.200\nthese little computers and they're tightly coiled like little X and Y chromosomes. Not\n\n01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.200\nin ropes wrapped around each other, compressed so hard and when they have to reproduce, they\n\n01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:53.200\nunravel and they're like a million miles long and they're just like tangled up. That's the\n\n01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.200\ntechnology you're limited to if you haven't invented computers yet and you can't make a\n\n01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:03.200\nlot of a big bang. You can only make a bunch of molecules run into each other so we represent\n\n01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:09.200\nthe cutting edge. We are the Apple laptop of biological information storage and we are\n\n01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.200\nnow what are we doing? What are we obsessed with? To the absolute exclusion of ourselves.\n\n01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.200\nThere are people starving in the streets. We're stepping over them on our way to develop\n\n01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:25.200\nwhat technology we need to create ways to store more information than we can store and I really\n\n01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:31.200\ndo have this unsettling feeling that once we do it, we're just going to be monkeys hanging\n\n01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.200\nout and we're going to find out we've been had. Well somebody asks here Dan, is the technological\n\n01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:43.200\nrevolution the beginning of the human evolution into cyborgs? Yes. That's right, that's right.\n\n01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.200\nBut they won't even look like cyborgs. It's just going to be this floating thing and part\n\n01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.200\nof what I said earlier, humanity needs to give itself more credit. Where are we headed that's\n\n01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.200\nfucking beautiful. Who do you hate your neighbor? Do you think he's racist? Do you think he's\n\n01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.200\na pedophile? Do you think he's greedy? Do you think he's mad at you? Do you think he's\n\n01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:06.200\ngreedy? Whatever he is, at least he's human. He's not an ant yet. So much of what we try\n\n01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:11.200\nto do, it's the best intentions but we police each other. I go, Daniel, don't make a rape\n\n01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:16.200\njoke, we caught you. It's fascism and we're clamping down on each other as we enter this\n\n01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.200\nage of internet, like everyone's saying shit in comedy clubs that they feel free to say.\n\n01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.200\nAnd then now it goes up on YouTube and then everyone, now you're doing this new Elizabethan\n\n01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:29.200\nage of like, fuck you, I caught you. We want to put this fucking clamp on each other. To\n\n01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:34.200\nwhat end? When are we going to be perfect? And what is that perfection going to resemble?\n\n01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:39.200\nWe are going to be fucked over. We've got to embrace the animal side of us. We feel\n\n01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:45.200\nsomething. When we feel hatred, at least we're at least there's something happening there\n\n01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:50.200\nthat doesn't happen with giraffes, sharks, fucking ants and whatever this thing we're\n\n01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:56.200\ncreating is. We should tread carefully. I said last week, I don't know if I made the\n\n01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:02.200\nfinal edit but we need a pro-human code because we are just this close. We're going to do\n\n01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:05.200\nit. We're going to make these things and they're going to be more important to us and\n\n01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.200\nthey're going to, we need to be prepared to say to those things, fuck you, we're more\n\n01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:15.200\nimportant because we're stupid or ignorant. We're angry. We have hormones. Something's\n\n01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:22.200\nvaluable about this or not but that's the side we need to be on. Maybe they are better\n\n01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:26.200\nthan us, these things that we're going to create. Fuck them. Have you ever been jealous of\n\n01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:30.200\nsomeone? Fuck them. That's like human instinct. Jealous of you. I don't want you to\n\n01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.200\nsucceed. I hate you. You're better than me. It's like parents and their children. That\n\n01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.200\nincredible jealousy that some parents have over their children. Yeah, we're going to\n\n01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.200\nmake these things that are going to eat us up. In a certain sense, they're already doing\n\n01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.200\nit. The devices, the things we carry in our pockets, they're swallowing us up. They're\n\n01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.200\nchanging the way we have sex with each other. They're changing what we say to each other.\n\n01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:54.200\nEvery time, what are we doing in the meantime? We're all gathered around this big, giant\n\n01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:59.200\nfucking cyborg that we're going to build and it's going to eat us. That giant cyborg,\n\n01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.200\nwhether he eats us or not, he will be wearing Adidas shoes. Yes. That's thank you for\n\n01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:09.200\ngetting to my point. Because that cyborg will make the logical choice for comfortable\n\n01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:19.200\nfootwear. Nike. And until such time as I get a giant fucking check from an unnamed\n\n01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:23.200\ncompany, I'm not going to change my position on that. All right, let's do that. Dan, do\n\n01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.200\nyou want to pick a number of words to answer some questions I have in my hand right now?\n\n01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:33.200\nDo you want to limit yourself? I say we leave it to one of the two black people in the\n\n01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:42.200\nfront row. I just noticed I've ignored you, which either makes me less or more racist.\n\n01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:50.200\nI don't know. Two black harmonetownians in the front row, I say, we'll turn our attention\n\n01:06:50.200 --> 01:07:02.200\nto you, sir. What's your name? NT? N-T-I? Cyborg. Cyborg. That's how they're going to get us.\n\n01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:07.200\nThat's what it is, that Skynet, of course, the first cyborgs will be black because we\n\n01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:15.200\nwon't question them as much. If he's in a Starbucks, you're just happy to have him. It\n\n01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.200\nmakes you feel less guilty. You're not going to, like, corner him and ask him, why are\n\n01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:25.200\nyou listening to that weird modem sound? You'll start listening to a modem sound. You\n\n01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:33.200\nfucking love it. It'll seem hip. All right, anyways. NT. N-T-I. NT. Pick a number between\n\n01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:43.200\ntwo and six. Four. All right. Forward answers. Thank you, NT. Forward answers. Thank you.\n\n01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:50.200\nSorry, racist. Sorry. Here we go. All right. Where should I go to survive the robot\n\n01:07:50.200 --> 01:08:05.200\napocalypse of 2014? Flagstaff, Arizona during Christmas. That's not random. I'll explain\n\n01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:23.200\nlater. What is a swamp donkey? Part donkey, part swamp. Should robot marriage be legal?\n\n01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:34.200\nOnly among consenting robots. Nice. Pen or techno pen? Obviously, techno pen. N-word.\n\n01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:40.200\nN-word. All right. Thank you very much for coming, everybody. That's been Harmontown.\n\n01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:50.200\nWe love you all. Thank you. Music. Olivia Newton, John, and EO. All right. We did it.\n\n01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:55.200\nThanks for coming, guys. You were a joy. You were a fantastic audience. Wonderful. Tell\n\n01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.200\nthat to the next audience, whatever you figured out. You guys are really great. Thank you\n\n01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:03.200\nso much for coming down. A couple of quick thank yous right now. I want to thank Katie\n\n01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:08.200\nLevine for doing our audio recording. Zac McKeever, our tech guy, Emily Gordon, producer\n\n01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:13.200\nfor our live show. Danielle Cramer, program director. Justin Marshall, our podcast producer.\n\n01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:18.200\nMo Fathelbab, onsite director. And Jenny Fine, our fantastic artist. Thank you so much\n\n01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:23.200\nfor coming down. Also, thank everybody here at the beautiful NerdMelt Theater. I'm Jeff\n\n01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:35.200\nDavis, your comment controller. One more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.002s"],"str_size":[73597]}
