{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:29.280\nHello gang, this show is not brought to you by Bud Light.\n\n00:29.280 --> 00:30.280\nWhat's good?\n\n00:30.280 --> 00:39.040\nFrom somewhere near downtown, Los Angeles, the city of angels in MacArthur Park, where\n\n00:39.040 --> 00:51.920\nI can indicate for some reason it's melting in the dark, Carmen Town is now in session.\n\n00:51.920 --> 01:05.520\nSpencer, motherfucking Corridandon, and the mayor of Carmen Town, the one and only Dan\n\n01:05.520 --> 01:23.760\nCarmel.\n\n01:23.760 --> 01:31.080\nYou heard that, the song hiccups a little bit, you gotta support me if you want to comport\n\n01:31.080 --> 01:32.080\nme.\n\n01:32.080 --> 01:39.920\nWell, off to a bad start, I don't want to be here either, thank you for coming.\n\n01:39.920 --> 01:41.720\nI'm just kidding, I do want to be here, thank you for coming.\n\n01:41.720 --> 01:42.720\nYou want to be here.\n\n01:42.720 --> 01:44.200\nHow many shows left are there?\n\n01:44.200 --> 01:45.200\nWhat's the time clock at?\n\n01:45.200 --> 01:47.760\nSix or something, I don't know.\n\n01:47.760 --> 01:48.840\nWhat would you say, Spencer?\n\n01:48.840 --> 01:49.840\nYou're good at calendar math.\n\n01:49.840 --> 01:55.320\nI would say two plus four plus, I would say 15?\n\n01:55.320 --> 01:57.320\nThat can't be right.\n\n01:57.320 --> 01:59.200\nWow, that's a lot of shows.\n\n01:59.200 --> 02:00.240\nThat's a lot of shows.\n\n02:00.240 --> 02:01.240\nThat's terrible.\n\n02:01.240 --> 02:02.960\nThat's like, what are we, figure skaters?\n\n02:02.960 --> 02:07.400\nBut also, we should have ended the show like a year ago, look at these fucking crowds\n\n02:07.400 --> 02:08.400\nwe're getting.\n\n02:08.400 --> 02:10.400\nI mean, there was like a good year or two, we're just knowing.\n\n02:10.400 --> 02:11.400\nWe should have ended the show a long time ago.\n\n02:11.400 --> 02:13.920\nYeah, we would have got our asses in seats.\n\n02:13.920 --> 02:14.920\nYeah.\n\n02:14.920 --> 02:19.960\nWell, a lot of people are making pilgrimages, I mean, I just, I myself, I moved away from\n\n02:19.960 --> 02:24.880\nLos Feliz, so I'm not at the drawing room as much, I walked over there to meet, didn't\n\n02:24.880 --> 02:29.760\nwalk over there, I, Dan, the details don't matter.\n\n02:29.760 --> 02:33.720\nI went into the drawing rooms to catch an Uber with Jeff to the show and there were\n\n02:33.720 --> 02:37.880\nseveral people, shout out to my miscreants from San Diego.\n\n02:37.880 --> 02:38.880\nYeah.\n\n02:38.880 --> 02:43.960\nI got, I got, I got, we got Little Bear and Gage out there, we got, who else?\n\n02:43.960 --> 02:47.280\nI got patched into a Burning Man group.\n\n02:47.280 --> 02:51.640\nI've never been to Burning Man, but if I go, I have a patch that I can iron onto the back\n\n02:51.640 --> 02:52.640\nof my jacket.\n\n02:52.640 --> 02:53.640\nI should probably stitch it on.\n\n02:53.640 --> 02:56.760\nLittle Bear and Gage, you out there?\n\n02:56.760 --> 02:57.760\nYeah.\n\n02:57.760 --> 02:58.760\nAll right.\n\n02:58.760 --> 02:59.760\nYeah.\n\n02:59.760 --> 03:01.600\nJen from Cincinnati was also at the bar.\n\n03:01.600 --> 03:02.600\nShe was there.\n\n03:02.600 --> 03:03.600\nJen, you with us?\n\n03:03.600 --> 03:04.600\nOkay.\n\n03:04.600 --> 03:08.640\nShe's like a little quiet Dave Kline.\n\n03:08.640 --> 03:09.640\nYep.\n\n03:09.640 --> 03:14.000\nAnd I also know, Jeff, you know, you're a big fan of my Instagram workout.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:15.000\nI am.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:16.520\nI trolled you all day today.\n\n03:16.520 --> 03:17.520\nYeah.\n\n03:17.520 --> 03:18.520\nWhoa.\n\n03:18.520 --> 03:20.680\nIs MLE 805 here?\n\n03:20.680 --> 03:21.680\nWhoop.\n\n03:21.680 --> 03:22.680\nWhoop.\n\n03:22.680 --> 03:23.680\nWhoop.\n\n03:23.680 --> 03:24.680\nWhoop.\n\n03:24.680 --> 03:25.680\nYeah.\n\n03:25.680 --> 03:27.480\nThere's a lot of mini-upers out there.\n\n03:27.480 --> 03:29.840\nA lot of people coming out.\n\n03:29.840 --> 03:34.480\nDo you think our crowds are big now because this is the Dying Embers?\n\n03:34.480 --> 03:35.960\nThis is the last two rounds?\n\n03:35.960 --> 03:36.960\nYeah.\n\n03:36.960 --> 03:39.400\nWhy would you go to something that was never ending?\n\n03:39.400 --> 03:41.360\nAre you going to miss it when it's gone, Dan?\n\n03:41.360 --> 03:42.360\nI'm sure.\n\n03:42.360 --> 03:43.360\nYeah.\n\n03:43.360 --> 03:44.360\nYeah.\n\n03:44.360 --> 03:45.360\nI'll miss it.\n\n03:45.360 --> 03:46.360\nBut you'll be happy when it's over?\n\n03:46.360 --> 03:47.360\nYeah.\n\n03:47.360 --> 03:53.760\nThat's like the Sklar Brothers have a joke that when something is bad, your voice goes\n\n03:53.760 --> 03:55.360\nup when you're talking about it.\n\n03:55.360 --> 03:56.360\nYou're like, oh, was that good?\n\n03:56.360 --> 03:59.880\nYou're like, oh, yeah, it was great, but if it was actually good, you're like, that was\n\n03:59.880 --> 04:00.880\ngreat.\n\n04:00.880 --> 04:01.880\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n04:01.880 --> 04:09.600\nI was walking down the road in a Washington, D.C. and I hear Jeff Davis and there's Randy\n\n04:09.600 --> 04:12.520\nSklar across the street from there.\n\n04:12.520 --> 04:15.480\nDon't twin high road us.\n\n04:15.480 --> 04:17.360\nYou just say there was a Sklar.\n\n04:17.360 --> 04:19.560\nNo, but no, but here's the thing.\n\n04:19.560 --> 04:28.880\nI had just five minutes before that was walking out of the elevator and I thought I saw a Sklar.\n\n04:28.880 --> 04:31.560\nAnd I was like, that guy looks a lot like a Sklar.\n\n04:31.560 --> 04:35.640\nI'm not sure which Sklar, but also I don't want a Sklar profile.\n\n04:35.640 --> 04:37.600\nYou need to become a Sklar Sklar.\n\n04:37.600 --> 04:41.480\nThat guy could just be any guy that looks a little bit like a Sklar.\n\n04:41.480 --> 04:44.760\nAnd then I heard Jeff Davis, it was Randy.\n\n04:44.760 --> 04:48.520\nAnd I don't know why Randy is the one I know right off the bat.\n\n04:48.520 --> 04:53.240\nBut the one that I saw by the elevator was Jason and they had a show a block away from\n\n04:53.240 --> 04:55.840\nthe hotel and they fucking killed it.\n\n04:55.840 --> 04:56.840\nThey absolutely slaughtered.\n\n04:56.840 --> 05:01.400\nOkay, but to be clear, so you didn't know, you said you saw, I taught, I saw a Sklar\n\n05:01.400 --> 05:02.400\nat the elevator.\n\n05:02.400 --> 05:03.400\nI thought I saw.\n\n05:03.400 --> 05:08.040\nAnd the Randy story is they went, he went, Jeff and you went Sklar and he was like, Randy\n\n05:08.040 --> 05:10.400\nand you left that out because you wanted people to think.\n\n05:10.400 --> 05:12.520\nCan I be totally honest with you?\n\n05:12.520 --> 05:13.520\nNo.\n\n05:13.520 --> 05:14.520\nCan I be it?\n\n05:14.520 --> 05:15.520\nNo.\n\n05:15.520 --> 05:16.520\nI don't know, can you?\n\n05:16.520 --> 05:17.520\nYes.\n\n05:17.520 --> 05:20.480\nLet me be quite honest about this.\n\n05:20.480 --> 05:27.440\nI thought there was a Sklar sighting, but it was in my really peripheral vision and that\n\n05:27.440 --> 05:28.960\njust passed.\n\n05:28.960 --> 05:35.800\nAnd then I was on the road and someone yelled my name out and it wasn't a real deal Sklar.\n\n05:35.800 --> 05:39.400\nAnd I wasn't totally sure which one it was.\n\n05:39.400 --> 05:40.400\nYou just rolled the fucking dice.\n\n05:40.400 --> 05:42.160\nAnd I walked up and I go, hey, what's up?\n\n05:42.160 --> 05:45.480\nI said, I thought I saw Sklar walk up and he goes, yeah, you saw Jason, Randy let me\n\n05:45.480 --> 05:50.600\nhang off the hook, that's all, that's all you had to, yeah, okay.\n\n05:50.600 --> 05:55.560\nBut now I think after hanging out with them individually that night, I think you bring\n\n05:55.560 --> 05:56.920\nany Sklar in here right now.\n\n05:56.920 --> 05:59.800\nI'll fucking tell you which one it is.\n\n05:59.800 --> 06:03.680\nI still can't tell the difference between the two guys that created HBO's animals.\n\n06:03.680 --> 06:06.120\nThey worked in an office with me for years.\n\n06:06.120 --> 06:08.160\nThey're not related.\n\n06:08.160 --> 06:11.280\nThey just both had beards and I was like, guys, I'm sorry.\n\n06:11.280 --> 06:13.960\nOnly one of them wore glasses, but now it's a fucking, who knows?\n\n06:13.960 --> 06:14.960\nThat's the thing.\n\n06:14.960 --> 06:15.960\nThat's the only trick.\n\n06:15.960 --> 06:16.960\nBut now they both wear glasses.\n\n06:16.960 --> 06:17.960\nThey both wear glasses.\n\n06:17.960 --> 06:23.440\nAnd I think Randy is the one that is more likely to wear a plaid.\n\n06:23.440 --> 06:25.360\nI think that's right.\n\n06:25.360 --> 06:27.200\nI think Jason likes his solids.\n\n06:27.200 --> 06:28.200\nI could tell.\n\n06:28.200 --> 06:29.520\nI could have Jason's a winter.\n\n06:29.520 --> 06:33.720\nI could imagine if I were a twin and the other one started wearing glasses, I would\n\n06:33.720 --> 06:38.840\nafter a while, I'd take them to dinner and be like, how's your wife, how are your kids\n\n06:38.840 --> 06:41.800\nthat are, are they identical to each other or me?\n\n06:41.800 --> 06:45.120\nAnyways, enough about that.\n\n06:45.120 --> 06:46.560\nWhat's with the glasses?\n\n06:46.560 --> 06:49.200\nAre you trying to be the smart twin?\n\n06:49.200 --> 06:52.920\nIs it okay if I wear, I would nip that in the bud.\n\n06:52.920 --> 06:53.920\nRight.\n\n06:53.920 --> 06:57.920\nLike I wouldn't mind any other gimmick, but if my twins started wearing glasses, I'd\n\n06:57.920 --> 07:00.280\nbe like, I'm allowed to wear glasses too.\n\n07:00.280 --> 07:01.280\nDon't do that.\n\n07:01.280 --> 07:05.880\nLike I'm not going to be the fucking Simon of these chipmunks or wait, no, I'm sorry.\n\n07:05.880 --> 07:06.880\nYou are going to be.\n\n07:06.880 --> 07:09.120\nI'm not going to let, I'm not going to be the fucking Alvin.\n\n07:09.120 --> 07:12.200\nI fucked it up.\n\n07:12.200 --> 07:17.240\nWhat if one just started wearing a monocle, but then if I know the scolaras and I think\n\n07:17.240 --> 07:22.200\nI kind of do now, they'll just fucking trade monocles and then you're fucked.\n\n07:22.200 --> 07:23.200\nWell, that would be cool.\n\n07:23.200 --> 07:28.640\nLike if you had a twin, I would, I would do like a Zorax and Xenon or whatever those\n\n07:28.640 --> 07:29.640\nguys were.\n\n07:29.640 --> 07:33.520\nLike one had a scar on one side of his face and the other had, let's do that.\n\n07:33.520 --> 07:36.920\nBut then I got to remember which side the scar is on.\n\n07:36.920 --> 07:42.400\nNo, no one does, but you would, you, you would, if someone had a scar on a different side\n\n07:42.400 --> 07:45.520\nof their face, you would be like, Oh, that's Randy for sure.\n\n07:45.520 --> 07:46.520\nRight.\n\n07:46.520 --> 07:47.520\nLike you, it would just, yeah, it would work.\n\n07:47.520 --> 07:48.760\nI would think them unidentical.\n\n07:48.760 --> 07:53.320\nI'm not going to enumerate what I think are the differences between them, but I think\n\n07:53.320 --> 07:57.400\nI could, I can totally nail who is which right now.\n\n07:57.400 --> 08:01.520\nJason used to be the one with glasses and now they both got glasses.\n\n08:01.520 --> 08:03.480\nBecause Randy was like, what are you trying to pull?\n\n08:03.480 --> 08:04.960\nI'm not the meat heads, Clara.\n\n08:04.960 --> 08:05.960\nThat's not.\n\n08:05.960 --> 08:09.440\nAnd then later it's like, I've had it up to here with these glasses.\n\n08:09.440 --> 08:10.440\nAll right.\n\n08:10.440 --> 08:11.440\nSclars, sclars, whatever.\n\n08:11.440 --> 08:12.440\nYou're off the hook.\n\n08:12.440 --> 08:13.440\nYou can go see them anytime you want.\n\n08:13.440 --> 08:16.440\nThey're never going to quit.\n\n08:16.440 --> 08:20.880\nThey're going to be here forever.\n\n08:20.880 --> 08:21.880\nYou're going to get sick of them.\n\n08:21.880 --> 08:23.800\nThey're going to ring your doorbell.\n\n08:23.800 --> 08:24.800\nMe, I'm Salinger.\n\n08:24.800 --> 08:27.520\nYou're going to hunt me down.\n\n08:27.520 --> 08:29.080\nPay attention to me.\n\n08:29.080 --> 08:30.080\nWhat I'm talking about.\n\n08:30.080 --> 08:31.080\nYou're talking about the Sclars.\n\n08:31.080 --> 08:32.080\nAll right.\n\n08:32.080 --> 08:33.080\nShut up.\n\n08:33.080 --> 08:40.360\nWhen Harmontown is dead and dusted and all gone away, are you going to ever wish that\n\n08:40.360 --> 08:45.600\nyou had this platform, this microphone, this audience again?\n\n08:45.600 --> 08:48.640\nAre you going to be quite happy that it's...\n\n08:48.640 --> 08:52.280\nThis doesn't seem that difficult to reattain.\n\n08:52.280 --> 08:57.440\nDo you think I'm being naive about that?\n\n08:57.440 --> 09:00.840\nBecause if anyone thinks I'm being naive about that, because I know that it would be naive\n\n09:00.840 --> 09:03.640\nif I was like, well, I could just do it again.\n\n09:03.640 --> 09:04.640\nOkay.\n\n09:04.640 --> 09:09.680\nSo you're saying that if you ever wanted to do it, you would do it in some other format\n\n09:09.680 --> 09:10.680\nor...\n\n09:10.680 --> 09:11.680\nOr the same format.\n\n09:11.680 --> 09:15.720\nIt's just the cables that you plugged in, you plug them in again.\n\n09:15.720 --> 09:16.720\nCheck, check.\n\n09:16.720 --> 09:17.720\nHey, hello.\n\n09:17.720 --> 09:19.720\nWell, we'll do, but do.\n\n09:19.720 --> 09:22.320\nIt's not that hard.\n\n09:22.320 --> 09:25.200\nI never stapled a flyer to a telephone pole.\n\n09:25.200 --> 09:30.800\nLike, you make a couple TV shows, people will show up.\n\n09:30.800 --> 09:33.760\nNot as many as when you say you're not going to do it anymore.\n\n09:33.760 --> 09:43.120\nLet's just ride this wave, finish up, we'll take six weeks.\n\n09:43.120 --> 09:44.120\nClassic Coke, baby.\n\n09:44.120 --> 09:45.120\nMotherfucker.\n\n09:45.120 --> 09:48.160\nAlways, always thinking.\n\n09:48.160 --> 09:52.040\nI like to imagine that the audience, when they were laughing, they were laughing at\n\n09:52.040 --> 09:53.040\nyour audacity.\n\n09:53.040 --> 09:55.080\nLike, they're like, we're not going to fucking be here.\n\n09:55.080 --> 09:56.720\nYou fucking kidding me?\n\n09:56.720 --> 10:00.040\nWe're fucking out.\n\n10:00.040 --> 10:03.520\nI mean, I'm sure they aren't, but it's fun to imagine.\n\n10:03.520 --> 10:07.840\nI hope everybody listening calls that bluff, but nobody ever shows up again.\n\n10:07.840 --> 10:14.400\nI almost distracted because I'm like, when we have a guest who I'm like, well, this\n\n10:14.400 --> 10:18.440\nis a guest in a stricter sense, like, probably not a fan of the show.\n\n10:18.440 --> 10:23.880\nThey're just like a person that it would be a delight to talk to, and this is their first\n\n10:23.880 --> 10:24.880\ntime being here.\n\n10:24.880 --> 10:27.920\nThey don't know anything about the show, and then I listened to this first eight minutes\n\n10:27.920 --> 10:32.000\nof the show through their ears in the green room, and I'm like, why couldn't I be out\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:33.000\nthere for this?\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nWhy is this?\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.720\nWhy is it important that I be sequestered and then brought out?\n\n10:36.720 --> 10:38.220\nThe answer is, I don't know.\n\n10:38.220 --> 10:43.840\nWhat is it that separates the guest part of the show from the non-guest part?\n\n10:43.840 --> 10:46.200\nI like to think it eats up more time this way.\n\n10:46.200 --> 10:50.640\nYeah, it's probably just, maybe I'm warming you guys up.\n\n10:50.640 --> 10:53.600\nI'm the world's worst MC.\n\n10:53.600 --> 10:55.600\nThey're back there going, thank God.\n\n10:55.600 --> 10:57.600\nI don't want to go out there cold.\n\n10:57.600 --> 11:04.200\nLike, old school, like, Carson, or, like, Leno, like, monologue bits, like, like, what's\n\n11:04.200 --> 11:05.200\nin the news?\n\n11:05.200 --> 11:07.680\nOkay, well, let me, okay, well, I gotta go, we're breaking news.\n\n11:07.680

something funny there.\n\n11:14.280 --> 11:17.880\nThat's a good idea.\n\n11:17.880 --> 11:19.160\nJeff's got a good idea there.\n\n11:19.160 --> 11:21.000\nOkay, well, there's no internet here.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:22.800\nOkay, so what do you want?\n\n11:22.800 --> 11:24.600\nI've got musical lead in.\n\n11:24.600 --> 11:25.600\nOh.\n\n11:25.600 --> 11:30.920\nI mean, just freestyle some good old-fashioned topical humor.\n\n11:30.920 --> 11:34.800\nLike, you know, Jack, Benny, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno.\n\n11:34.800 --> 11:42.000\nLike, okay, well, maybe it's like a, can it just be placeholder, like, we're in a parallel\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:43.000\ndimension.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nSure.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.000\nWe don't know.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.520\nOkay, so, you just want the cadence of, like, an opening monologue.\n\n11:47.520 --> 11:48.520\nIt's tonight.\n\n11:48.520 --> 11:49.520\nRight.\n\n11:49.520 --> 11:52.600\nYou know, and, like, Joan Embry from the San Diego Zoo.\n\n11:52.600 --> 11:53.600\nRight.\n\n11:53.600 --> 11:56.600\nAnd here he is, Dan Harmon.\n\n11:56.600 --> 11:57.600\nRight.\n\n11:57.600 --> 11:58.600\nWhoa.\n\n11:58.600 --> 12:04.600\nPicture a red, a red curtain opening.\n\n12:04.600 --> 12:07.600\nDan leans over and waves to the band.\n\n12:07.600 --> 12:09.600\nHere we go.\n\n12:09.600 --> 12:10.600\nYeah.\n\n12:10.600 --> 12:12.760\nThank you very much.\n\n12:12.760 --> 12:16.480\nI know you were paid to react that way.\n\n12:16.480 --> 12:17.480\nWhat's going on?\n\n12:17.480 --> 12:18.480\nYou're already there.\n\n12:18.480 --> 12:19.480\nWow.\n\n12:19.480 --> 12:21.640\nUkraine madness.\n\n12:21.640 --> 12:28.640\nI'm more familiar with the Ukraine now than I am my hometown, Jeff.\n\n12:28.640 --> 12:34.640\nUh, and what's your hometown again?\n\n12:34.640 --> 12:35.640\nUkraine.\n\n12:35.640 --> 12:36.640\nI wish I knew.\n\n12:36.640 --> 12:37.640\nOkay.\n\n12:37.640 --> 12:44.040\nSo you could throw that to a room, if there's a town in Ukraine, then it would be funny.\n\n12:44.040 --> 12:45.040\nYeah.\n\n12:45.040 --> 12:48.600\nWe could play a little hometown, and then you go and I go, Zalinksk, you know, and it's\n\n12:48.600 --> 12:49.600\nlike, chuckle.\n\n12:49.600 --> 12:53.720\nI'm saying, if you just said, you forgot your hometown, you said it was the Ukraine.\n\n12:53.720 --> 12:54.720\nBoom.\n\n12:54.720 --> 12:55.720\nLaugh.\n\n12:55.720 --> 12:56.720\nRight.\n\n12:56.720 --> 12:57.720\nNext joke.\n\n12:57.720 --> 12:58.720\nSo I fucked up.\n\n12:58.720 --> 12:59.720\nI fucked up.\n\n12:59.720 --> 13:00.720\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n13:00.720 --> 13:01.720\nNo, no.\n\n13:01.720 --> 13:02.720\nYou're nailing it so far.\n\n13:02.720 --> 13:03.720\nSo next joke.\n\n13:03.720 --> 13:04.720\nOkay.\n\n13:04.720 --> 13:07.880\nSo just like, let's take it back.\n\n13:07.880 --> 13:11.600\nI remember a real joke that Carson did that I never understood.\n\n13:11.600 --> 13:12.600\nOkay.\n\n13:12.600 --> 13:16.680\nAnd I want to do it.\n\n13:16.680 --> 13:21.280\nI remember I was obsessed with Carson because I have dim memories of right before Letterman\n\n13:21.280 --> 13:26.480\nlike started and it was just like, I was obsessed with Carson, then I immediately became obsessed\n\n13:26.480 --> 13:27.480\nwith Letterman.\n\n13:27.480 --> 13:32.440\nBut like, it was like, I remember watching Carson and I was just a kid, it was just obsessed\n\n13:32.440 --> 13:37.200\nwith the idea of, of like making people happy and like performing and things, but I didn't\n\n13:37.200 --> 13:39.560\nunderstand any of the jokes.\n\n13:39.560 --> 13:45.000\nAnd I, but I would then later I would understand the jokes, I'd go, well, I understand that\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:50.320\nlike Shelly Winters is famous for being fat, I can figure this out.\n\n13:50.320 --> 13:53.040\nWe didn't have the internet, but there was like an encyclopedia, you could look up Shelly\n\n13:53.040 --> 13:57.640\nWinters and say fat.\n\n13:57.640 --> 13:58.640\nShe didn't deserve it.\n\n13:58.640 --> 13:59.640\nIt was a terrible time.\n\n13:59.640 --> 14:03.280\nLike there was no shame and that included everybody.\n\n14:03.280 --> 14:04.880\nAcademy award-winning actress.\n\n14:04.880 --> 14:05.880\nYeah.\n\n14:05.880 --> 14:08.520\nIt was like, if you were a man that dressed like a woman, people would be like, oh, that's\n\n14:08.520 --> 14:09.520\nhilarious.\n\n14:09.520 --> 14:10.520\nAnd it was like problematic.\n\n14:10.520 --> 14:11.960\nSo we figured that out later over time.\n\n14:11.960 --> 14:14.480\nIt took an internet.\n\n14:14.480 --> 14:16.600\nThere was this show Mash and there was, there was a character on it.\n\n14:16.600 --> 14:19.440\nHe dressed like a lady and it was like funny at everybody all the time.\n\n14:19.440 --> 14:21.360\nNow he'd be brave and you would be an asshole.\n\n14:21.360 --> 14:22.360\nAll right.\n\n14:22.360 --> 14:27.760\nSo anyways, the, this is the joke that he did.\n\n14:27.760 --> 14:33.040\nHe was like, like, he was in his model, like I said, boy, you know, it's a, it's a, it's\n\n14:33.040 --> 14:37.880\nbeen, there's been so much smog in Burbank, but it's cleared up, Ed, it's all, it's all\n\n14:37.880 --> 14:38.880\ncleared up.\n\n14:38.880 --> 14:45.640\nThere was so much, so much, so much smog in, in, in, in Burbank, but then it cleared up.\n\n14:45.640 --> 14:53.040\nToday, a, a, reportedly a, there was a robin that saw it was eating a worm and spit it\n\n14:53.040 --> 14:54.040\nout.\n\n14:54.040 --> 15:03.560\nI was like, I don't understand, are you saying it's been so smoggy?\n\n15:03.560 --> 15:08.240\nIs your joke how smoggy it is or is your joke how smoggy it's been?\n\n15:08.240 --> 15:13.600\nIt's been so smoggy that all birds in Burbank, like, have never known they've been eating\n\n15:13.600 --> 15:15.200\nworms, which they do all over the world.\n\n15:15.200 --> 15:19.160\nOr is that worms are notorious for eating smog?\n\n15:19.160 --> 15:20.440\nAre you sure that's the joke?\n\n15:20.440 --> 15:21.440\nWell, that's all right.\n\n15:21.440 --> 15:24.120\nI'm not sure are you, that is the actual joke.\n\n15:24.120 --> 15:25.200\nI can't be 100% sure.\n\n15:25.200 --> 15:27.720\nLet's bring our guest out.\n\n15:27.720 --> 15:29.080\nHe's going to clarify everything.\n\n15:29.080 --> 15:30.080\nHe's German.\n\n15:30.080 --> 15:31.080\nHe's a YouTuber.\n\n15:31.080 --> 15:35.520\nUh, I wonder if YouTuber is like a point of offense for, for people at all.\n\n15:35.520 --> 15:38.960\nLet's talk to him about that and more.\n\n15:38.960 --> 15:47.000\nPlease welcome someone who I was shocked to see how tall he was because it's just YouTube\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:48.000\nand stuff.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:52.640\nAnd then you just see a head and then you're like, whoa, that head's far off

is?\n\n26:54.540 --> 26:55.540\nYes, yes, yes.\n\n26:55.540 --> 26:56.540\nIceland.\n\n26:56.540 --> 26:57.540\nStrange.\n\n26:57.540 --> 26:58.540\nFlamingos.\n\n26:58.540 -->

wham.\n\n27:05.220 --> 27:06.220\nYes.\n\n27:06.220 --> 27:08.220\nGot it.\n\n27:08.220 --> 27:10.420\nIt's like talking to Mork, you're like Mork.\n\n27:10.420 --> 27:13.140\nMork, Mork and Bjork.\n\n27:13.140 --> 27:15.140\nPerfect.\n\n27:15.140 --> 27:21.460\nFlula, you've got, my boss's family is coming for dinner tonight, you have to learn how\n\n27:21.460 --> 27:22.460\nto behave.\n\n27:22.460 --> 27:23.460\nZinks or inks.\n\n27:23.460 --> 27:34.860\nWhat is it, you do a show here at the Hayworth Dynasty typewriter show.\n\n27:34.860 --> 27:37.460\nNice branding shout out in case people did not know.\n\n27:37.460 --> 27:42.100\nYeah, you can, if you walked here and bought your tickets, you could do it again for Flula,\n\n27:42.100 --> 27:43.740\nbut you probably already knew he was here, right?\n\n27:43.740 --> 27:44.740\nOh, didn't he did?\n\n27:44.740 --> 27:45.740\nWhat's that?\n\n27:45.740 --> 27:46.740\nYou did?\n\n27:46.740 --> 27:47.740\nNo, I'm saying to them.\n\n27:47.740 --> 27:48.740\nOh yeah.\n\n27:48.740 --> 27:49.740\nI was just in case they don't know.\n\n27:49.740 --> 27:50.740\nOkay.\n\n27:50.740 --> 27:51.740\nAnd what's that show like?\n\n27:51.740 --> 27:52.740\nUp and Up.\n\n27:52.740 --> 27:55.700\nI just, I'm like a man that sits where you are sitting and I have a looping pedal and\n\n27:55.700 --> 27:59.180\nI just make some tasty tunes and say words on occasion.\n\n27:59.180 --> 28:00.740\nHow does a looping pedal work?\n\n28:00.740 --> 28:01.740\nNobody knows.\n\n28:01.740 --> 28:06.580\nI don't have a dumb question, but like, it's like, so like you could go like biscuits,\n\n28:06.580 --> 28:10.700\nbiscuits and then you hit the pedal and the pedal makes it just keep going, biscuits, biscuits,\n\n28:10.700 --> 28:11.700\nbiscuits, biscuits.\n\n28:11.700 --> 28:12.700\nAnd the pedal makes it peak on the pedal.\n\n28:12.700 --> 28:13.700\nSo you forgot to hit the pedal first.\n\n28:13.700 --> 28:14.700\nOkay.\n\n28:14.700 --> 28:19.260\nSo you would go, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits,\n\n28:19.260 --> 28:21.180\ngravy, biscuits, gravy, biscuits.\n\n28:21.180 --> 28:22.180\nOh, okay.\n\n28:22.180 --> 28:23.180\nYeah.\n\n28:23.180 --> 28:24.180\nTasty.\n\n28:24.180 --> 28:25.180\nNasty chef.\n\n28:25.180 -->

28:32.740\nSteve Levy and the vodka solo.\n\n28:32.740 --> 28:35.580\nIs that what summons the vodka?\n\n28:35.580 --> 28:38.100\nWe accidentally, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits.\n\n28:38.100 --> 28:40.380\nWhat summons the tacos?\n\n28:40.380 --> 28:41.380\nOkay.\n\n28:41.380 --> 28:45.220\nI thought we had a good jam going there with the biscuits.\n\n28:45.220 --> 28:46.940\nThat was nice.\n\n28:46.940 --> 28:48.900\nYou're working with Conan.\n\n28:48.900 --> 28:50.660\nThe show is produced by him.\n\n28:50.660 --> 28:52.540\nI'm long-summed to see you.\n\n28:52.540 --> 28:53.540\nYeah, he's disgusted.\n\n28:53.540 --> 28:57.260\nNo, I, it's, it disgusted with myself because I'm like, I don't, I don't know enough about\n\n28:57.260 --> 28:58.260\nyou.\n\n28:58.260

face.\n\n29:03.620 --> 29:04.620\nOh, love it.\n\n29:04.620 --> 29:05.620\nSquinting.\n\n29:05.620 --> 29:06.620\nI'm very familiar.\n\n29:06.620 --> 29:07.620\nAs a German, we have all of these feelings every day.\n\n29:07.620 --> 29:08.620\nOkay.\n\n29:08.620 --> 29:13.220\nYeah, the German language would just stack a bunch of words.\n\n29:13.220 --> 29:16.700\nThere would be a, that's what's attracted me about German.\n\n29:16.700 --> 29:19.740\nThe fact that you could stack a bunch of words together and make a new word.\n\n29:19.740 --> 29:20.740\nIsn't there a German word?\n\n29:20.740 --> 29:21.740\nScheisse.\n\n29:21.740 --> 29:22.740\nYeah, yeah.\n\n29:22.740 --> 29:23.740\nYeah.\n\n29:23.740 --> 29:24.740\nWe are 12 cop pile up.\n\n29:24.740 --> 29:25.740\nIt's probably called Word and Stacking.\n\n29:25.740 --> 29:26.740\nThat's how it works.\n\n29:26.740 --> 29:27.740\nYeah.\n\n29:27.740 --> 29:28.740\nActually how did you?\n\n29:28.740 --> 29:29.740\nVerdenstachen.\n\n29:29.740 --> 29:30.740\nVerdenstachen.\n\n29:30.740 --> 29:31.740\nYou say it like this.\n\n29:31.740 --> 29:32.740\nIt's true.\n\n29:32.740 --> 29:33.740\nYeah.\n\n29:33.740 --> 29:38.860\nI love, my favorite is full common height.\n\n29:38.860 --> 29:39.860\nFull common height?\n\n29:39.860 --> 29:40.860\nYeah.\n\n29:40.860 --> 29:41.860\nWhat does it mean?\n\n29:41.860 --> 29:42.860\nPerfection.\n\n29:42.860 --> 29:43.860\nOkay.\n\n29:43.860 --> 29:44.860\nRight?\n\n29:44.860 --> 29:45.860\nAm I right?\n\n29:45.860 --> 29:46.860\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n29:46.860 --> 29:47.860\nMy favorite is Scheißfreundlich at the moment.\n\n29:47.860 --> 29:48.860\nShit isn't there for sure.\n\n29:48.860 --> 29:49.860\nYes, it is.\n\n29:49.860 --> 29:50.860\nOkay.\n\n29:50.860 --> 29:51.860\nDing, ding.\n\n29:51.860 --> 29:52.860\nWalk us through slowly.\n\n29:52.860 --> 29:53.860\nSay it word by word.\n\n29:53.860 --> 29:54.860\nScheißfreundlich.\n\n29:54.860 --> 29:57.820\nAnd so you've gotten the first one, Dudys.\n\n29:57.820 --> 29:58.820\nShit-friendly.\n\n29:58.820 --> 29:59.820\nOh nice.\n\n29:59.820 --> 30:01.580\nScheißfreundlich occurs many times.\n\n30:01.580 --> 30:06.460\nI was recently in Atlanta, and so if someone is there like, hey, how would you like some\n\n30:06.460 --> 30:07.460\nturkey?\n\n30:07.460 --> 30:08.460\nDo you like it?\n\n30:08.460 --> 30:11.900\nYou know, it's like, but you know, soon when they turn around, they are very miserable\n\n30:11.900 --> 30:13.380\nwith their life.\n\n30:13.380 --> 30:15.860\nSo poop-friendly is not a real friendly.\n\n30:15.860 --> 30:16.860\nIt is a doodle-friendly.\n\n30:16.860 --> 30:17.860\nOh, I was right.\n\n30:17.860 --> 30:18.860\nMy friendly?\n\n30:18.860 --> 30:19.860\nYeah.\n\n30:19.860 --> 30:20.860\nWhat?\n\n30:20.860 --> 30:21.860\nScheißfreundlich.\n\n30:21.860 --> 30:22.860\nScheißfreundlich.\n\n30:22.860 --> 30:23.860\nSo someone has like a face that is happy, but deep inside there.\n\n30:23.860 --> 30:24.860\nJust they do not like you so much.\n\n30:24.860 --> 30:25.860\nScheißfreundlich.\n\n30:25.860 --> 30:26.860\nDoes it have to-\n\n30:26.860 --> 30:27.860\nScheißfreundlich?\n\n30:27.860 --> 30:28.860\nScheißfreundlich.\n\n30:28.860 --> 30:33.020\nIs it based on you, or could it just be that they're, because you said they're like miserable,\n\n30:33.020 --> 30:34.860\nis it about their feelings toward you?\n\n30:34.860 --> 30:38.540\nNo, it's like in physics, the vector, the direction doesn't matter.\n\n30:38.540 --> 30:40.380\nIt's just all over the place.\n\n30:40.380 --> 30:43.420\nIt's not a ray, it's just a...\n\n30:43.420 --> 30:47.380\nIt's the fact that they're comfortable wearing a mask.\n\n30:47.380 --> 30:48.380\nYes.\n\n30:48.380 --> 30:52.380\nSo you know that Dan Harmon is a very well-known Hozenpizler?\n\n30:52.380 --> 30:53.380\nOh.\n\n30:53.380 --> 30:54.380\nYou are Hozenpizler?\n\n30:54.380 --> 30:55.380\nYeah.\n\n30:55.380 --> 30:58.380\nI think I pee in my pants.\n\n30:58.380 --> 30:59.380\nHozenpizler.\n\n30:59.380 --> 31:00.380\nHozenpizler.\n\n31:00.380 --> 31:01.380\nHozenpizler.\n\n31:01.380 --> 31:02.380\nMy socks.\n\n31:02.380 --> 31:03.380\nMy socks.\n\n31:03.380 -->

31:08.380\nA Treppenwitz.\n\n31:08.380 --> 31:09.380\nTreppenwitz.\n\n31:09.380 --> 31:10.380\nA Treppe is a stairs.\n\n31:10.380 --> 31:11.380\nOr for you guys, this care stays.\n\n31:11.380 --> 31:13.380\nStays, what, you know, the stepy, stepy, stepy, what's this called?\n\n31:13.380 --> 31:14.380\nA case of stairs.\n\n31:14.380 --> 31:15.380\nA case of stairs.\n\n31:15.380 --> 31:16.380\nA staircase.\n\n31:16.380 --> 31:17.380\nThank you, Spencer.\n\n31:17.380 --> 31:18.380\nTreppenwitz.\n\n31:18.380 --> 31:19.380\nTreppenwitz.\n\n31:19.380 --> 31:20.380\nAnd a witz is a joke.\n\n31:20.380 --> 31:21.380\nOkay?\n\n31:21.380 --> 31:23.380\nAnd so it is like if you and I are having some reportees, reportees or whatever, you're\n\n31:23.380 --> 31:24.900\nlike, oh, say something rude to me.\n\n31:24.900 --> 31:26.140\nOh, fuck you.\n\n31:26.140 --> 31:31.700\nAnd I would be like, and then as I leave, I think of a good response, but I am already\n\n31:31.700 --> 31:32.700\nin the staircase.\n\n31:32.700 --> 31:33.700\nIt is too late.\n\n31:33.700 --> 31:34.700\nRight.\n\n31:34.700 --> 31:35.700\nThat's the...\n\n31:35.700 --> 31:38.860\nI think in French it's l'esprit de scallier.\n\n31:38.860 --> 31:39.860\nYep.\n\n31:39.860 --> 31:40.860\nOh, yeah.\n\n31:40.860 --> 31:41.860\nThe spirit of the staircase.\n\n31:41.860 --> 31:43.500\nI guess you guys are next to that.\n\n31:43.500 --> 31:44.500\nWe did.\n\n31:44.500 --> 31:45.500\nYeah.\n\n31:45.500 --> 31:46.500\nYeah, yeah.\n\n31:46.500 --> 31:47.500\nWe said we wouldn't and then we did.\n\n31:47.500 --> 31:48.500\nWell, they built the arch.\n\n31:48.500 --> 31:50.780\nWho did they expect to merge through it?\n\n31:50.780 --> 31:55.220\nI think that was born on the Alsace-le-Ran, which is, you know, a disputed region between\n\n31:55.220 --> 31:56.220\nFrench and German.\n\n31:56.220 --> 31:58.220\nWell, it was Germany for six years.\n\n31:58.220 --> 32:00.220\nIt's still grudges.\n\n32:00.220 --> 32:01.220\nNo grudges.\n\n32:01.220 --> 32:02.220\nI love it over there.\n\n32:02.220 --> 32:03.220\nI love it over there.\n\n32:03.220 --> 32:04.220\nWhat do you call it in German again?\n\n32:04.220 --> 32:05.220\nTreppenwitz.\n\n32:05.220 --> 32:06.220\nTreppenwitz.\n\n32:06.220 --> 32:07.220\nTreppenwitz, yes.\n\n32:07.220 --> 32:08.740\nSo because the treppen is the stairs?\n\n32:08.740 --> 32:09.740\nYes.\n\n32:09.740 --> 32:10.740\nAnd the witz is a joke.\n\n32:10.740 --> 32:11.740\nIt's a response.\n\n32:11.740 --> 32:15.420\nI do love the idea that in both phrases, it's like the thing that stayed was the stairs.\n\n32:15.420 --> 32:17.780\nThe stairs for me.\n\n32:17.780 --> 32:22.980\nAnd I think there's an English equivalent, like it just stairway wit or something we\n\n32:22.980 --> 32:23.980\ncall it.\n\n32:23.980 --> 32:30.340\nIt's not a household phrase, but it's people that borrowed it from the French.\n\n32:30.340 --> 32:36.780\nBut I like the thing that stays is the staircase, because that implies that you were definitely\n\n32:36.780 --> 32:37.900\na guest.\n\n32:37.900 --> 32:40.340\nAnd definitely on the second floor or higher.\n\n32:40.340 --> 32:46.100\nAnd it also, yeah, well, that's what's interesting to me, is like, why is that important?\n\n32:46.100 --> 32:47.740\nThere must be some reason.\n\n32:47.740 --> 32:51.020\nIs it like a Downton Abbey thing, or it's like, well, you were upstairs?\n\n32:51.020 --> 33:00.300\nIt's like, are you talking to me, like looking in the mirror, like, I'm a hero talking to\n\n33:00.300 --> 33:01.300\nnobody right now.\n\n33:01.300 --> 33:03.540\nIt's the idea that you've got the comebacks.\n\n33:03.540 --> 33:06.900\nBut why not the l'esprit de sidewalk?\n\n33:06.900 --> 33:08.860\nWhy not parking lot?\n\n33:08.860 --> 33:09.860\nWhy not hallway?\n\n33:09.860 --> 33:14.380\nAnd the answer must be very specific, like in our psyche, because it's like to be going\n\n33:14.380 --> 33:21.500\ndownstairs after you, I think it evokes penthouses, I think it evokes like modern metropolitan.\n\n33:21.500 --> 33:25.700\nTo live in the ground floor in France would be like lower status, to live a little higher\n\n33:25.700 --> 33:27.300\nup would be a little like.\n\n33:27.300 --> 33:33.780\nYou mean you're in the city and you're like, it's not like wit of the of the pasture.\n\n33:33.780 --> 33:38.180\nYeah, like, like, oh, Farmer Brown like made a comment about my milking.\n\n33:38.180 --> 33:41.580\nI came up with something by the scarecrow.\n\n33:41.580 --> 33:42.780\nThe stakes aren't that high.\n\n33:42.780 --> 33:47.620\nIt's like the staircase evokes this you're on your way down and out of the building from\n\n33:47.620

36:39.580\nSo they are teachers and have summer breaks.\n\n36:39.580 --> 36:41.420\nSo in the summer, we would come here sometime.\n\n36:41.420 --> 36:44.540\nSo this was my first exposure to your, to the disease of America.\n\n36:44.540 --> 36:45.540\nJust vacations.\n\n36:45.540 --> 36:46.540\nAnd I got it.\n\n36:46.540 --> 36:47.540\nYeah.\n\n36:47.540 --> 36:50.540\nAnd so then when I was able and legal to come, I attended your country.\n\n36:50.540 --> 36:53.740\nDid your parents bring you here just because they knew you were into it?\n\n36:53.740 --> 36:55.140\nNo, everyone was into it.\n\n36:55.140 --> 36:56.140\nOh, okay.\n\n36:56.140 --> 36:57.140\nYeah, yeah.\n\n36:57.140 --> 36:58.140\nIt's like snap wraps.\n\n36:58.140 --> 36:59.140\nLike everyone kind of likes this.\n\n36:59.140 --> 37:04.180\nYou're like, mom, dad, I'm, I'm into America and they were like, get out of my brain.\n\n37:04.180 --> 37:05.180\nYeah.\n\n37:05.180 --> 37:06.180\nStop

37:50.340\nThat's nice.\n\n37:50.340 --> 37:51.340\nYeah.\n\n37:51.340 --> 37:53.620\nHow long did you correspond with this pen pal as seven years?\n\n37:53.620 --> 37:54.620\nAre you kidding me?\n\n37:54.620 --> 38:00.860\nNo jokes starting from what age were you seven and then so you continued it till you were\n\n38:00.860 --> 38:01.860\npuberty.\n\n38:01.860 --> 38:08.100\nAnd then it was like, is it me or is letter writing losing a bluster?\n\n38:08.100 --> 38:13.580\nI just want to stare in a mirror and see the erections.\n\n38:13.580 --> 38:14.580\nIt wasn't on paper.\n\n38:14.580 --> 38:16.020\nYou were emailing, I'm assuming.\n\n38:16.020 --> 38:17.020\nNo email.\n\n38:17.020 --> 38:19.220\nNo, no, no, writing, writing for real, of course.\n\n38:19.220 -->

--> 38:24.220\nThat is really cool.\n\n38:24.220 --> 38:25.980\nI bet that, I mean, I'm like, like, who's this person?\n\n38:25.980 --> 38:30.380\nI mean, you don't have to, their privacy is their business, but like they're an American\n\n38:30.380 --> 38:32.900\nperson that's corresponded with you for seven years.\n\n38:32.900 --> 38:35.380\nLike, I'm sure this had a huge impact.\n\n38:35.380 --> 38:36.380\nI don't know.\n\n38:36.380 --> 38:37.380\nAm I being naive?\n\n38:37.380 --> 38:39.900\nI'm like, boy, that seems like such a great thing for a kid developmentally.\n\n38:39.900 -->

it's\n\n38:45.620 --> 38:47.580\nlike a shashank redemption.\n\n38:47.580 --> 38:50.340\nBut also just have a relationship for years and years.\n\n38:50.340 --> 38:52.900\nWas the entire seven years

social\n\n38:58.500 --> 38:59.500\nmedia wise.\n\n38:59.500 --> 39:02.020\nYou know, when someone is sitting on you as you do it, and you're trying to hype that\n\n39:02.020 --> 39:03.020\ncrowd.\n\n39:03.020 --> 39:04.020\nIt forces you.\n\n39:04.020 --> 39:05.020\nYeah.\n\n39:05.020 --> 39:06.020\nHow did you first meet?\n\n39:06.020 --> 39:07.020\nI'm sorry.\n\n39:07.020

years.\n\n39:23.460 --> 39:24.460\nYeah, yeah.\n\n39:24.460 --> 39:25.460\nThousands of days.\n\n39:25.460 --> 39:28.780\nDo you, would you even know how to get in touch with them if you?\n\n39:28.780 --> 39:31.620\nMaybe Google, but like I am mysteriously incurious.\n\n39:31.620 --> 39:32.620\nYeah.\n\n39:32.620 --> 39:33.620\nYeah.\n\n39:33.620 --> 39:34.620\nWell, yeah.\n\n39:34.620 -->

fizzle out and die or like, why did that go away?\n\n39:42.100 --> 39:46.820\nI think we just, as you said, they turned 14 and different things, you know, new kids\n\n39:46.820 --> 39:52.340\non the block hanging tough, you know, yeah, that, that, uh, that changed me too.\n\n39:52.340 --> 39:53.900\nThere was, there was tough hanging to do.\n\n39:53.900 --> 39:54.900\nYeah.\n\n39:54.900 -->

never wrote to each other again after\n\n40:55.260 --> 40:56.260\nthat.\n\n40:56.260 --> 40:57.260\nNo, we were done.\n\n40:57.260 --> 40:58.260\nWe were done.\n\n40:58.260 --> 40:59.260\nOh, look at you.\n\n40:59.260 --> 41:00.260\nWe were done.\n\n41:00.260 --> 41:01.260\nLook at you.\n\n41:01.260 --> 41:02.260\nYeah.\n\n41:02.260 --> 41:03.260\nRemember that time you wrote that thing?\n\n41:03.260 --> 41:04.260\nYes.\n\n41:04.260 --> 41:05.260\nIt's right here.\n\n41:05.260 --> 41:06.260\nI'm holding it to page two.\n\n41:06.260 --> 41:10.340\nWas it, was it, was it, do you, like, I, I'm sorry, I'm making the whole night about\n\n41:10.340 --> 41:13.380\nthis, but this is fascinating to me.\n\n41:13.380 --> 41:17.580\nDid you guys agree in that face to face meeting?\n\n41:17.580 --> 41:18.580\nWe're done.\n\n41:18.580 --> 41:19.580\nRight?\n\n41:19.580 --> 41:20.580\nNo.\n\n41:20.580 --> 41:21.580\nIt just happened because of that.\n\n41:21.580 --> 41:23.740\nAnd you never acknowledged it, but it just happened.\n\n41:23.740 --> 41:26.980\nIt is like when you are in love with a lady or man or a tree, whatever it's your thing\n\n41:26.980 --> 41:29.540\nand you speak for many, many, many months and then it happens.\n\n41:29.540 --> 41:30.540\nAnd then it's like, oh.\n\n41:30.540 --> 41:31.540\nYeah.\n\n41:31.540 --> 41:32.540\nI mean, how could it?\n\n41:32.540 --> 41:33.540\nOh, it's so sad.\n\n41:33.540 --> 41:34.540\nWe cannot talk about this.\n\n41:34.540 --> 41:35.540\nThat's really sad.\n\n41:35.540 --> 41:36.540\nOh, it's great.\n\n41:36.540 --> 41:37.540\nIt was wonderful.\n\n41:37.540 --> 41:40.780\nIt was a nice reason to come to America and enjoy some things and, you know, have an orange\n\n41:40.780 --> 41:41.780\nJulius.\n\n41:41.780 --> 41:44.220\nWe did have a Cinnabon.\n\n41:44.220 --> 41:45.220\nRight.\n\n41:45.220 --> 41:46.220\nThe whole mall smells.\n\n41:46.220 --> 41:47.220\nWhy is the Cinnabon everywhere?\n\n41:47.220 --> 41:48.500\nIt does not matter where you are.\n\n41:48.500 --> 41:51.780\nIt smells of these juicy buns.\n\n41:51.780 --> 41:52.780\nI just wonder.\n\n41:52.780 --> 41:58.140\nYeah, my cynical brain wants to know, there was two 14-year-old kids.\n\n41:58.140 --> 41:59.660\nWas it mutual?\n\n41:59.660 --> 42:02.380\nWas one of them completely disenchanted?\n\n42:02.380 --> 42:03.940\nWas there a chain reaction?\n\n42:03.940 --> 42:06.140\nWhat happened?\n\n42:06.140 --> 42:10.140\nI know that I wrote to him one time and I think maybe he also did, but we never, it\n\n42:10.140 --> 42:11.140\nnever, nothing.\n\n42:11.140 --> 42:12.420\nYeah, just tapered off.\n\n42:12.420 --> 42:18.500\nIt was like, yeah, I hope that that person is not out there somewhere going like, where\n\n42:18.500 --> 42:19.500\nis he?\n\n42:19.500 --> 42:20.500\nI fucked it up.\n\n42:20.500 --> 42:21.500\nI fucked it up.\n\n42:21.500 --> 42:22.500\nNo.\n\n42:22.500 --> 42:24.140\nIt was a star-com spaceship.\n\n42:24.140 --> 42:26.140\nHave you heard of star-com?\n\n42:26.140 --> 42:27.140\nYou push a button.\n\n42:27.140 --> 42:28.860\nIt opens very, very slowly.\n\n42:28.860 --> 42:31.980\nThe men have metal feet.\n\n42:31.980 --> 42:33.460\nWas that what micronauts became?\n\n42:33.460 --> 42:35.100\nI don't know micronauts.\n\n42:35.100 --> 42:37.740\nAre these like a small part of Russia?\n\n42:37.740 --> 42:38.740\nAstronauts?\n\n42:38.740 --> 42:42.580\nNo, micronauts were these like little tiny plastic guys with a million joints and they\n\n42:42.580 --> 42:43.580\nhad plastic feet.\n\n42:43.580 --> 42:46.620\nYou already said metal feet, we know it's like this.\n\n42:46.620 --> 42:49.180\nThey take it inside the micro-machines with the man's feet.\n\n42:49.180 --> 42:54.540\nThey cause it, cause it, cause it, well, whatever, we'll figure this out.\n\n42:54.540 --> 42:59.260\nIs it easier to be a hype man in German or in English for you?\n\n42:59.260 --> 43:02.620\nEven in German, you use English words, we just like to say them.\n\n43:02.620 --> 43:03.860\nAll of our things are English.\n\n43:03.860 --> 43:08.980\nWe have lucky strike, the cigarettes, all of the advertisements are always in English.\n\n43:08.980 --> 43:17.380\nIt's like, son of a bitch, lucky strike, you know?\n\n43:17.380 --> 43:26.060\nI mean, you're joking of course, but I think, I think my favorite advertisement of all time\n\n43:26.060 --> 43:29.660\nis an early lucky strike and I might be wrong, but I think it's lucky strike.\n\n43:29.660 --> 43:35.860\nAnd it was like in the 40s, so round, so firm, so fully packed.\n\n43:35.860 --> 43:36.860\nPenis.\n\n43:36.860 --> 43:40.340\nI can't tell if it's an ass or a dick.\n\n43:40.340 --> 43:41.340\nWhat is it?\n\n43:41.340 --> 43:42.340\nYeah.\n\n43:42.340 --> 43:43.340\nI want to smoke it.\n\n43:43.340 --> 43:44.340\nWhatever it is.\n\n43:44.340 --> 43:45.340\nWhatever you want to suck on it.\n\n43:45.340 --> 43:46.340\nA match book.\n\n43:46.340 --> 43:49.940\nSomething you want to light it on fire and put it in your mouth.\n\n43:49.940 --> 43:50.940\nYes.\n\n43:50.940 --> 43:53.220\nWe don't want to disenchant any demographic.\n\n43:53.220 --> 43:54.980\nIt's fucking round and fully packed.\n\n43:54.980 --> 43:55.980\nGet your mouth on it.\n\n43:55.980 --> 43:56.980\nSo round.\n\n43:56.980 --> 43:57.980\nImmediately.\n\n43:57.980 --> 43:58.980\nAll right.\n\n43:58.980 --> 44:02.620\nYou'd be a fool not to put it in your mouth.\n\n44:02.620 --> 44:08.340\nSo you come with your parents, you meet your pen pal, whatever, like America becomes\n\n44:08.340 --> 44:14.420\nthis thing and then there's a certain point, so I just want to then understand at what\n\n44:14.420 --> 44:21.300\npoint, because you said, and you're kind of a dry guy, so I'm not sure which is true\n\n44:21.300 --> 44:22.300\nand which is not.\n\n44:22.300 --> 44:27.940\nBut you came here, entered a hype man contest and then like, but I just want to know, yeah,\n\n44:27.940 --> 44:31.180\nwhat point are you an adult and you go like, all right, that's it, I'm making the move.\n\n44:31.180 --> 44:35.900\nI'm going to be here on a tourist visa or a work visa and then you're like, okay, I'm\n\n44:35.900 --> 44:38.020\nstaying and I've done it.\n\n44:38.020 --> 44:39.020\nIt's just fascinating to me.\n\n44:39.020 --> 44:42.620\nWell, the introduction, like the first taste of cocaine when the man's like, please snort\n\n44:42.620 --> 44:44.020\nit for free.\n\n44:44.020 --> 44:46.020\nThis was my Cornwall.\n\n44:46.020 --> 44:47.100\nThat was my Cornwall.\n\n44:47.100 --> 44:51.660\nAnd then some years later, I was like, I need to try this, this cocaine for real, you know.\n\n44:51.660 --> 44:53.580\nWell, if that's the case, then can I pause you there?\n\n44:53.580 --> 44:57.900\nBecause I want to know like a 14 year old German boy in whatever year we won't date\n\n44:57.900 --> 44:58.900\nyou.\n\n44:58.900 --> 45:00.400\nBut we know you played with G.I.\n\n45:00.400 --> 45:05.300\nJoe's and the, which, but if German moves slowly, maybe that was 1997.\n\n45:05.300 --> 45:12.100\nDo you remember details of like comparing it to that?\n\n45:12.100 --> 45:14.460\nWhat is it, what is that crack hit of America?\n\n45:14.460 --> 45:19.660\nLike what are the, what, what, what hits your lungs that you're like, oh shit, maybe I should\n\n45:19.660 --> 45:20.660\nlive here.\n\n45:20.660 --> 45:21.660\nOh, it's a television.\n\n45:21.660 --> 45:22.660\nYes.\n\n45:22.660 --> 45:27.900\nYou guys, you had very dope MTV and then you had very many call numbers, you know, 191,\n\n45:27.900 --> 45:33.380\n10, 10, 220 with Toby Keith, like 10, $1 gives you 20 minutes of call time.\n\n45:33.380 --> 45:34.380\nIs that right?\n\n45:34.380 --> 45:35.380\nToby?\n\n45:35.380 --> 45:36.380\nHe's like, yes.\n\n45:36.380 --> 45:38.580\nYou know, but you didn't call any of those.\n\n45:38.580 --> 45:40.460\nYes, of course.\n\n45:40.460 --> 45:41.460\nYou called Toby Keith?\n\n45:41.460 --> 45:44.020\nWell, he was, he did not answer his room.\n\n45:44.020 --> 45:50.140\nI also called 1-800-USA-GIRL and if you call 1-800-USA-GIRL, you can try to be America's\n\n45:50.140 --> 45:51.140\ngirl.\n\n45:51.140 --> 45:55.140\nAnd so I would call as me, but like with a high voice and try to apply to win the USA\n\n45:55.140 --> 45:56.140\nGirl competition.\n\n45:56.140 --> 45:57.140\nAll right.\n\n45:57.140 --> 45:58.140\nI can't.\n\n45:58.140 --> 45:59.140\nAll right.\n\n45:59.140 --> 46:00.140\nI'm not gonna.\n\n46:00.140 --> 46:01.140\n1-800-USA-GIRL.\n\n46:01.140 --> 46:02.140\nYeah.\n\n46:02.140 --> 46:03.140\nBut it's not.\n\n46:03.140 --> 46:04.140\nAll right.\n\n46:04.140 --> 46:05.140\nI'm not going to be sincere anymore.\n\n46:05.140 --> 46:06.140\nThese are real things.\n\n46:06.140 --> 46:10.580\nWait, but it was like, I believe you a little bit when you're saying like that was a thing,\n\n46:10.580 --> 46:13.300\nlike the TV had all these commercials on it for these things.\n\n46:13.300 --> 46:15.860\nThe whole culture is free and everything is cool.\n\n46:15.860 --> 46:16.860\nBut it wasn't free.\n\n46:16.860 --> 46:17.860\nIt was $1.95 a minute.\n\n46:17.860 --> 46:18.860\nIt was a horribly expensive.\n\n46:18.860 --> 46:19.860\nI never paid it.\n\n46:19.860 --> 46:20.860\nNo.\n\n46:20.860 --> 46:21.860\nYou just, it's like the, I ought to maybe eat a boy.\n\n46:21.860 --> 46:22.860\nDo you remember this commercial?\n\n46:22.860 --> 46:23.860\nRight.\n\n46:23.860 --> 46:24.860\nYeah.\n\n46:24.860 --> 46:25.860\nYeah.\n\n46:25.860 --> 46:28.620\nSo you, so, so that I get.\n\n46:28.620 --> 46:34.580\nSo you're just coming over here from Europe, like the TV and that culture was actually\n\n46:34.580 --> 46:36.900\nlike overwhelmingly a positive thing.\n\n46:36.900 --> 46:37.900\nYes.\n\n46:37.900 --> 46:39.820\nAnd rule bending and breaking is so fun here to do.\n\n46:39.820 --> 46:44.180\nYou know, like when, after, before I won the Hypeman contest, I was here before one time\n\n46:44.180 --> 46:50.420\nand I watched five films at the Burbank AMC 16, but only paid for one.\n\n46:50.420 --> 46:57.180\nI watched a Cinderella man and Mrs. Mr. and Mrs. Smith and then the War of the Worlds.\n\n46:57.180 --> 46:58.180\nAnd then that's a very fantastic.\n\n46:58.180 --> 46:59.180\nBecause you can just stay in the theater.\n\n46:59.180 --> 47:00.180\nYeah.\n\n47:00.180 --> 47:01.180\nWho cares?\n\n47:01.180 --> 47:02.180\nIn Germany, this will not happen.\n\n47:02.180 --> 47:03.180\nRight.\n\n47:03.180 --> 47:08.060\nBecause the, the soft underbelly of extreme capitalism is like, who's going to watch\n\n47:08.060 --> 47:09.060\nfive movies?\n\n47:09.060 --> 47:10.060\nThat's not pretty.\n\n47:10.060 --> 47:14.220\nAnd why would we pay an usher to, sorry, I thought you were referencing churches, Italy,\n\n47:14.220 --> 47:15.700\nthe strategy of World War Two.\n\n47:15.700 --> 47:16.700\nOh, no, no.\n\n47:16.700 --> 47:17.700\nSorry.\n\n47:17.700 --> 47:18.700\nThat's what I thought, too.\n\n47:18.700 --> 47:19.700\nSoft underbelly.\n\n47:19.700 --> 47:20.700\nI didn't mean to trigger you.\n\n47:20.700 --> 47:21.700\nSorry.\n\n47:21.700 --> 47:25.340\nI didn't know a soft underbelly's were trigger freaks.\n\n47:25.340 --> 47:28.180\nThey came up to the land on Palermo and they went to Sicily.\n\n47:28.180 --> 47:29.180\nIs there a better?\n\n47:29.180 --> 47:30.180\nI'm sorry.\n\n47:30.180 --> 47:31.180\nI'm sorry.\n\n47:31.180 --> 47:35.740\nLook, it was, I think we can all agree it was a very tragic war for everybody.\n\n47:35.740 --> 47:38.300\nWell, it's our fault.\n\n47:38.300 --> 47:39.300\nLet's be real.\n\n47:39.300 --> 47:40.300\nWe are the real ticks.\n\n47:40.300 --> 47:41.300\nYeah, yeah.\n\n47:41.300 --> 47:42.300\nWe know.\n\n47:42.300 --> 47:46.820\nI have a couple of friends that are German and they, people, Americans that I know, like\n\n47:46.820 --> 47:50.420\nthe kind of the joke is that Germans have a weird sense of humor, but I find that the\n\n47:50.420 --> 47:52.820\nGerman sense of humor is incredibly funny.\n\n47:52.820 --> 47:59.060\nAnd I think a lot of it is the word play, because we are, as English speakers, it's\n\n47:59.060 --> 48:03.020\na Germanic language, like pretty, like largely.\n\n48:03.020 --> 48:06.300\nThere's also like Latin roots and stuff like that, but we're very German.\n\n48:06.300 --> 48:11.740\nBut my German friends, if they hear a word, they have eight jokes for it, like which you've\n\n48:11.740 --> 48:17.300\nalready kind of proven, like it's, I find the German sense of humor really, really delightful.\n\n48:17.300 --> 48:18.300\nWow.\n\n48:18.300 --> 48:19.300\nThat's very rare to hear.\n\n48:19.300 --> 48:25.180\nI have my friend from England, he was like, hey, do you know the difference between British\n\n48:25.180 --> 48:26.180\nhumor and German humor?\n\n48:26.180 --> 48:27.180\nI was like, no, tell me.\n\n48:27.180 --> 48:28.980\nHe's like, yeah, British humor is funny.\n\n48:28.980 --> 48:29.980\nSuck it.\n\n48:29.980 --> 48:38.540\nWell, British humor is like, you know, also word play and irony and, but the German humor,\n\n48:38.540 --> 48:45.380\nin my experiences, it's really like punny, but in a fun way, like puns can be kind of\n\n48:45.380 --> 48:53.500\nawful, but the use of words to turn themselves inside out, I find very good.\n\n48:53.500 --> 48:54.500\nI like this as well.\n\n48:54.500 --> 48:56.060\nI feel like it is in affliction.\n\n48:56.060 --> 48:57.780\nI don't know that it's funny.\n\n48:57.780 --> 48:58.780\nRight.\n\n48:58.780 --> 48:59.780\nYeah.\n\n48:59.780 --> 49:00.780\nYou can't help yourself from it.\n\n49:00.780 --> 49:01.780\nI cannot help it.\n\n49:01.780 --> 49:02.780\nYeah.\n\n49:02.780 --> 49:03.780\nYeah.\n\n49:03.780 --> 49:04.780\nI love it.\n\n49:04.780 --> 49:05.780\nSo you come over here, you enter a hype man contest.\n\n49:05.780 --> 49:06.780\nI do.\n\n49:06.780 --> 49:07.780\nYes.\n\n49:07.780 --> 49:08.780\nThis is a real thing.\n\n49:08.780 --> 49:09.780\nYes.\n\n49:09.780 --> 49:10.780\nThe Siam.\n\n49:10.780 --> 49:11.780\nI will send you the link.\n\n49:11.780 --> 49:14.180\nIt's a Siam hype man contest in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n49:14.180 --> 49:16.260\nAnd they're like, and I love the spirit of this contest.\n\n49:16.260 --> 49:20.060\nThey're like, we want, we're looking for somebody who's pure hype man.\n\n49:20.060 --> 49:21.060\nYes.\n\n49:21.060 --> 49:28.060\nAnd then I can see why, like you're, yeah, like you, you take the cake.\n\n49:28.060 --> 49:31.420\nAnd so I wonder what, what did your parents do by the way?\n\n49:31.420 --> 49:33.060\nOh, no, taking the cake is good.\n\n49:33.060 --> 49:35.540\nNo, no, no, you grab it in the strudel.\n\n49:35.540 --> 49:36.540\nOkay.\n\n49:36.540 --> 49:38.540\nThank you.\n\n49:38.540 --> 49:42.380\nI did not know if it takes the cake was a euphemism for invading Poland or something\n\n49:42.380 --> 49:43.380\nlike that.\n\n49:43.380 --> 49:44.380\nAgain, just.\n\n49:44.380 --> 49:50.060\nYou're not Borat, you know, you know that taking the cake is good.\n\n49:50.060 --> 49:51.060\nYes.\n\n49:51.060 --> 49:52.060\nCake is nice.\n\n49:52.060 --> 49:53.060\nI like cake.\n\n49:53.060 --> 49:54.060\nLet's take it.\n\n49:54.060 --> 49:55.060\nYes.\n\n49:55.060 --> 50:02.700\nBut there was a point where you, I'm just curious, like, what did your, what did your\n\n50:02.700 --> 50:03.860\nfamily do?\n\n50:03.860 --> 50:08.540\nLike what, there was a point where it seems like, because fast forward to the end of it,\n\n50:08.540 --> 50:11.060\nyou're, you're, you're a guest on the show.\n\n50:11.060 --> 50:12.300\nYou're working with Conan.\n\n50:12.300 --> 50:13.380\nYou're all over the place.\n\n50:13.380 --> 50:15.060\nYour face is on postage stamps.\n\n50:15.060 --> 50:18.620\nYou're, you're, you're, you're a successful luminary.\n\n50:18.620 --> 50:19.620\nYou're an icon.\n\n50:19.620 --> 50:23.020\nYou're, you're a celebrated person.\n\n50:23.020 --> 50:29.380\nAnd in like, I, I, I'm fascinated by this, this fact that there had to be a moment where\n\n50:29.380 --> 50:35.180\nthere was like this boat that like you, you're like, I'm going to just do this for real.\n\n50:35.180 --> 50:40.580\nLike I'm not going to just have a fantasy about being like crazy and fun and like I,\n\n50:40.580 --> 50:47.300\nI'm actually like, I'm going to suck on this nipple and it's not a nipple, just, that's\n\n50:47.300 --> 50:48.300\nit.\n\n50:48.300 --> 50:54.260\nWell, in Germany, those are nipples, I don't say, well, it's could be regional.\n\n50:54.260 --> 50:55.260\nWelcome to America.\n\n50:55.260 --> 50:56.260\nIt's a Boise nipple or something.\n\n50:56.260 --> 50:57.260\nI don't know.\n\n50:57.260 --> 50:58.260\nWe call it.\n\n50:58.260 --> 50:59.260\nYeah.\n\n50:59.260 --> 51:00.260\nWe're a very homophobic culture here.\n\n51:00.260 --> 51:02.860\nSo we, we call when we have to grip something and just put the whole thing in our mouth,\n\n51:02.860 --> 51:05.020\nwe just call it a giant cylindrical nipple.\n\n51:05.020 --> 51:06.020\nGot it.\n\n51:06.020 --> 51:07.020\nOkay.\n\n51:07.020 --> 51:08.020\nIt keeps us straight.\n\n51:08.020 --> 51:13.500\nOh, you just want to chug on that fame.\n\n51:13.500 --> 51:14.500\nAnd then you tickle the under.\n\n51:14.500 --> 51:22.580\nYour boomerang's out everybody, but I don't know, I swear this is the last, this is the\n\n51:22.580 --> 51:26.860\nlast biopic question I asked and then we can get into the present and have fun or whatever.\n\n51:26.860 --> 51:33.340\nBut like, I just want to be at that moment of, of actual like, because you're, are you\n\n51:33.340 --> 51:34.340\nAmerican now?\n\n51:34.340 --> 51:35.340\nAre you a dual citizen?\n\n51:35.340 --> 51:36.340\nDo you have citizenship?\n\n51:36.340 --> 51:39.900\nNo, not American, but maybe this will occur.\n\n51:39.900 --> 51:42.700\nI don't, it doesn't matter so much.\n\n51:42.700 --> 51:43.700\nNot anymore.\n\n51:43.700 --> 51:44.700\nWell, now it's weird.\n\n51:44.700 --> 51:45.700\nYeah.\n\n51:45.700 --> 51:46.700\nYeah.\n\n51:46.700 --> 51:50.580\nI mean, the last president was born in Kenya and the current one can't read.\n\n51:50.580 --> 51:52.100\nOh yes.\n\n51:52.100 --> 51:55.120\nBoth facts.\n\n51:55.120 --> 52:01.020\nAnyway, but, but, but, but, but yeah.\n\n52:01.020 --> 52:04.660\nSo this is, I know you, I'm telling you truths for reals.\n\n52:04.660 --> 52:07.540\nI entered this hype, hype man contest for real.\n\n52:07.540 --> 52:08.700\nI did not know I would win.\n\n52:08.700 --> 52:12.860\nI thought I would be like the William Hang of the of the hype man contest.\n\n52:12.860 --> 52:16.940\nI just wanted like one minute of, oh, look at the idiot and then I can show this to my\n\n52:16.940 --> 52:17.940\nparents.\n\n52:17.940 --> 52:18.940\nRight.\n\n52:18.940 --> 52:21.100\nSo because I did not know what I was doing, I won this.\n\n52:21.100 --> 52:24.340\nIt's always nice to be confusing if, if part of hype, probably.\n\n52:24.340 --> 52:25.340\nYes.\n\n52:25.340 --> 52:26.340\nLike why?\n\n52:26.340 --> 52:27.340\nLike they would play a different beat.\n\n52:27.340 --> 52:28.660\nThey're like, what beat would you like to hype to?\n\n52:28.660 --> 52:29.660\nI was like, I don't know.\n\n52:29.660 --> 52:30.660\nBeat two.\n\n52:30.660 --> 52:31.660\nAnd then they beat two.\n\n52:31.660 --> 52:32.660\nI don't know.\n\n52:32.660 --> 52:36.780\nBut then they're like, then they're like, we're going to play beat three.\n\n52:36.780 --> 52:41.660\nAnd this other hype man would be like short circuited, you know, like that shitty Johnny\n\n52:41.660 --> 52:46.260\nfive robot, but for me, did you have an emcee that you would hype that there was there like\n\n52:46.260 --> 52:47.260\na dedicated emcee?\n\n52:47.260 --> 52:48.580\nThere were three judges.\n\n52:48.580 --> 52:52.700\nOne of the guys was Ant Marshal from the Lyrisis Lounge and then DJ clock Kent who worked\n\n52:52.700 --> 52:55.900\nwith JC and then, oh, shit, a third one.\n\n52:55.900 --> 53:00.340\nAnyway, it's so say you're hyping somebody that's actually doing like rap.\n\n53:00.340 --> 53:01.340\nThere's it.\n\n53:01.340 --> 53:04.980\nNo, there's no what the rapper never appears.\n\n53:04.980 --> 53:05.980\nThat's the ultimate.\n\n53:05.980 --> 53:06.980\nOkay.\n\n53:06.980 --> 53:07.980\nYes.\n\n53:07.980 --> 53:11.900\nI don't think you're ready.\n\n53:11.900 --> 53:12.900\nYeah.\n\n53:12.900 --> 53:14.660\nAnd it's just a turtle.\n\n53:14.660 --> 53:15.660\nYou're hyping nobody.\n\n53:15.660 --> 53:19.780\nI still can't hear you.\n\n53:19.780 --> 53:22.820\nAre you ready for Dr. Xavier?\n\n53:22.820 --> 53:25.500\nWhy aren't your hands already together?\n\n53:25.500 --> 53:26.500\nYes.\n\n53:26.500 --> 53:27.500\nYes.\n\n53:27.500 --> 53:28.500\nThat's fucking.\n\n53:28.500 --> 53:29.500\nWow.\n\n53:29.500 --> 53:30.500\nWhen I say hip, you say nothing.\n\n53:30.500 --> 53:31.500\nNo one is there.\n\n53:31.500 --> 53:32.500\nYes.\n\n53:32.500 --> 53:38.780\nSo is it like a two minute, two minutes, or do you, do they tell you when you're done?\n\n53:38.780 --> 53:42.700\nI just keep going and going like we would still be doing your sleepy song now if you\n\n53:42.700 --> 53:44.700\nguys had continued it because I don't know.\n\n53:44.700 --> 53:50.180\nAnd do they eventually put a hook around you or show time, they go like it's over, you're\n\n53:50.180 --> 53:51.180\ndone.\n\n53:51.180 --> 53:52.180\nYour entry is.\n\n53:52.180 --> 53:53.180\nWhy some word?\n\n53:53.180 --> 53:54.180\nWhy some word?\n\n53:54.180 --> 53:56.300\nHow does it end when you're hype manning in your, as your entry in the contest?\n\n53:56.300 --> 53:58.300\nIt's the first time the sound broke.\n\n53:58.300 --> 54:02.020\nSo then I kept freestyle rapping and they were very confused that this continued.\n\n54:02.020 --> 54:03.900\nI didn't know I should stop.\n\n54:03.900 --> 54:05.780\nAnd so they enjoyed this anyway.\n\n54:05.780 --> 54:06.780\nSo I want this thing.\n\n54:06.780 --> 54:10.540\nAnd then I was like, oh, this is a, this should mean I should stay here and do more things.\n\n54:10.540 --> 54:14.860\nAnd so then I just, it is like in the Vegas or Reno, wherever you go with circus, circus\n\n54:14.860 --> 54:15.860\nis located.\n\n54:15.860 --> 54:18.420\nAnd you just, you keep making a double down of things.\n\n54:18.420 --> 54:19.420\nYeah.\n\n54:19.420 --> 54:20.420\nSo that's what I just keep doing.\n\n54:20.420 --> 54:21.420\nAnd you made a good call.\n\n54:21.420 --> 54:22.420\nYou're happy now, right?\n\n54:22.420 --> 54:23.420\nYou're an adult and you're.\n\n54:23.420 --> 54:24.420\nI'm adult.\n\n54:24.420 --> 54:30.380\nYou're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're not lifting things for a living.\n\n54:30.380 --> 54:31.380\nJust waits.\n\n54:31.380 --> 54:32.380\nYeah.\n\n54:32.380 --> 54:33.380\nDo you, do you work out?\n\n54:33.380 --> 54:36.260\nI have to look at it.\n\n54:36.260 --> 54:37.260\nI have to do it.\n\n54:37.260 --> 54:38.260\nIt's a job.\n\n54:38.260 --> 54:39.260\nYeah.\n\n54:39.260 --> 54:44.300\nI was instructed to use what explain that I received a project and they like you

--> 54:51.060\nNo.\n\n54:51.060 --> 54:54.500\nYou're not allowed to say you're in Suicide Squad.\n\n54:54.500 --> 54:55.500\nThat's false.\n\n54:55.500 --> 54:56.500\nThat's a false.\n\n54:56.500 --> 54:57.500\nIt's not real.\n\n54:57.500 --> 54:58.500\nWell, I think James good.\n\n54:58.500 --> 54:59.500\nWe did something.\n\n54:59.500 --> 55:00.500\nWell, I'm going to disagree with this.\n\n55:00.500 --> 55:05.860\nPeople are very excited about that.\n\n55:05.860 --> 55:06.860\nIt's okay.\n\n55:06.860 --> 55:07.860\nAll right.\n\n55:07.860 --> 55:12.060\nSo you know our friend, Steve Agee, you didn't probably.\n\n55:12.060 --> 55:13.060\nOh, he is tall.\n\n55:13.060 --> 55:14.060\nYes, he is.\n\n55:14.060 --> 55:15.060\nYes.\n\n55:15.060 --> 55:16.060\nHe's about your

what happens.\n\n56:20.380 --> 56:21.380\nOkay.\n\n56:21.380 --> 56:22.380\nSo some tips.\n\n56:22.380 --> 56:25.060\nAlways ask a yes or no question, but it must be like a yes.\n\n56:25.060 --> 56:26.060\nOkay.\n\n56:26.060 --> 56:31.060\nSo does anybody want cupcakes?\n\n56:31.060 --> 56:32.060\nExcellent.\n\n56:32.060 --> 56:33.060\nYes.\n\n56:33.060 --> 56:35.060\nWho wants to drink diarrhea?\n\n56:35.060 --> 56:36.060\nNo.\n\n56:36.060 --> 56:37.060\nNo.\n\n56:37.060 --> 56:38.060\nDon't do that.\n\n56:38.060 --> 56:39.060\nQuestion.\n\n56:39.060 --> 56:40.060\nDon't do

56:55.060\nYes.\n\n56:55.060 --> 56:59.760\nAnd what is the goal of the hype man or hype person?\n\n56:59.760 --> 57:07.660\nIs it to get the party started and put the MC on like a floating cloud of energy?\n\n57:07.660 --> 57:10.500\nLike golf brooks coming from the grand piano.\n\n57:10.500 --> 57:15.060\nAnd then all they have to do is just sing a song and do nothing, but maybe the crowd\n\n57:15.060 --> 57:16.060\nis already there.\n\n57:16.060 --> 57:17.060\nYes.\n\n57:17.060 --> 57:23.620\nAnd in the hype man's mind, is there such a thing as a bad MC?\n\n57:23.620 --> 57:27.340\nLike there can't be right because you have to stay the hype man.\n\n57:27.340 --> 57:28.340\nYes.\n\n57:28.340 --> 57:29.340\nYou have to stay in those brains.\n\n57:29.340 --> 57:30.340\nYou can't go outside and look.\n\n57:30.340 --> 57:32.820\nWhat if you don't believe in your hype, your MC?\n\n57:32.820 --> 57:36.060\nWhat if your MC is something that you don't believe and you're like, do I still have to\n\n57:36.060 --> 57:37.220\nhype this person?\n\n57:37.220 --> 57:38.960\nEvery MC is your crystal light.\n\n57:38.960 --> 57:39.960\nYou believe in it.\n\n57:39.960 --> 57:41.140\nYou believe in it.\n\n57:41.140 --> 57:44.980\nYou believe in crystal light because you believe in me.\n\n57:44.980 --> 57:50.180\nWhy do you know more references in America than all of these people?\n\n57:50.180 --> 57:51.180\nTelevision commercials.\n\n57:51.180 --> 57:52.180\nI told you.\n\n57:52.180 --> 57:53.180\nCrystal light.\n\n57:53.180 --> 57:55.540\nWhat's such a thing as a hype man whistleblower?\n\n57:55.540 --> 57:56.540\nAre they protected?\n\n57:56.540 --> 57:58.340\nIf they're like, you know what?\n\n57:58.340 --> 57:59.340\nYou are terrible.\n\n57:59.340 --> 58:03.460\nYou are ready for him and he's not ready for you.\n\n58:03.460 --> 58:04.980\nAnd that's a crime.\n\n58:04.980 --> 58:09.980\nI need to be protected and I need people to not know my name is Flavor Flav.\n\n58:09.980 --> 58:13.820\nThis is why I was not a successful hype man in Germany because this would exist immediately.\n\n58:13.820 --> 58:14.820\nRight.\n\n58:14.820 --> 58:15.820\nI would tell you right away.\n\n58:15.820 --> 58:16.820\nYou are not adequate.\n\n58:16.820 --> 58:19.660\nThe decibels are too low away.\n\n58:19.660 --> 58:24.380\nBut let's say you're backstage, let's just say you've just met your MC.\n\n58:24.380 --> 58:25.380\nYou're the hype man.\n\n58:25.380 --> 58:26.380\nOkay.\n\n58:26.380 --> 58:27.380\nLet's say you've been lifelong friends.\n\n58:27.380 --> 58:28.380\nWe are friends.\n\n58:28.380 --> 58:31.020\nAnd you're like, I don't think you got it tonight.\n\n58:31.020 --> 58:32.020\nI say this.\n\n58:32.020 --> 58:37.020\nNo, no, like in your mind, you're like, I don't think the MC, like how do I get out there?\n\n58:37.020 --> 58:38.220\nHe said too much to drink.\n\n58:38.220 --> 58:39.220\nHe's unhypeable.\n\n58:39.220 --> 58:40.220\nYeah.\n\n58:40.220 --> 58:41.220\nHe's unhypeable.\n\n58:41.220 --> 58:44.020\nProbably a dirty word in your profession.\n\n58:44.020 --> 58:45.020\nThat's fine.\n\n58:45.020 --> 58:50.460\nI'm an honest hype person for going out there and hyping up something that you don't believe\n\n58:50.460 --> 58:51.460\nin.\n\n58:51.460 --> 58:53.380\nDo you know who Kurt Rambus is?\n\n58:53.380 --> 58:54.380\nYes.\n\n58:54.380 --> 58:56.420\nThe sixth man in the LA Lakers.\n\n58:56.420 --> 58:57.420\nThank you.\n\n58:57.420 --> 58:58.420\nOkay.\n\n58:58.420 --> 58:59.420\nWait, that's not true.\n\n58:59.420 --> 59:00.420\nThat's not true.\n\n59:00.420 --> 59:01.420\nIs it true?\n\n59:01.420 --> 59:02.420\nYes.\n\n59:02.420 --> 59:03.420\nShut up.\n\n59:03.420 --> 59:04.420\nKurt Rambus.\n\n59:04.420 --> 59:05.420\nKurt Rambus wear glasses.\n\n59:05.420 --> 59:06.420\nHe would come in and give 5,000 and go out and get kicked out.\n\n59:06.420 --> 59:07.420\nYes.\n\n59:07.420 --> 59:08.420\nAnd he would punch.\n\n59:08.420 --> 59:09.420\nWhat the fuck?\n\n59:09.420 --> 59:10.420\nHe would punch.\n\n59:10.420 --> 59:18.780\nI have a German hype man and a guy that sleeps in his suit and he said, do you know who Kurt\n\n59:18.780 --> 59:19.780\nSchmickenschmack is?\n\n59:19.780 --> 59:22.420\nAnd you're like, the sixth linebacker on the lake.\n\n59:22.420 --> 59:23.420\nNo.\n\n59:23.420 --> 59:24.420\nHe was the sixth man off.\n\n59:24.420 --> 59:27.940\nHe was the first one off the bench and his job was to foul everybody in clothesline and\n\n59:27.940 --> 59:28.940\nhe saw.\n\n59:28.940 --> 59:29.940\nKevin Bacon.\n\n59:29.940 --> 59:30.940\nKevin Bacon.\n\n59:30.940 --> 59:31.940\nKevin Bacon.\n\n59:31.940 --> 59:32.940\nKevin Bacon.\n\n59:32.940 --> 59:33.940\nKevin Bacon.\n\n59:33.940 --> 59:34.940\nKevin Bacon also.\n\n59:34.940 --> 59:35.940\nSix rules.\n\n59:35.940 --> 59:36.940\nSix degrees.\n\n59:36.940 --> 59:37.940\nWho gives a shit?\n\n59:37.940 --> 59:38.940\nExactly.\n\n59:38.940 --> 59:40.940\nGo on.\n\n59:40.940 --> 59:41.940\nWhy Kurt Rambus?\n\n59:41.940 --> 59:42.940\nWhy do you feel it?\n\n59:42.940 --> 59:43.940\nYeah.\n\n59:43.940 --> 59:44.940\nYour point being.\n\n59:44.940 --> 59:45.940\nSometimes Karim Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy are just tired.\n\n59:45.940 --> 59:46.940\nOh, I don't want to play today.\n\n59:46.940 --> 59:47.940\nI don't want to make a nice skyhookie.\n\n59:47.940 --> 59:48.940\nGreat.\n\n59:48.940 --> 59:49.940\nBring in Kurt.\n\n59:49.940 --> 59:50.940\nKurt will foul in Elbow and make it dunk.\n\n59:50.940 --> 59:51.940\nIf you fucking win.\n\n59:51.940 --> 59:57.140\nBut sometimes Karim is ready for some skyhookies and Michael Koopas making swishies and dees.\n\n59:57.140 --> 59:58.140\nThat is fucking profound.\n\n59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.460\nKurt, sit on the bench, make a little swiggy swig.\n\n01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.460\nClap, clap, clap.\n\n01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.460\nOkay.\n\n01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.460\nThat is a fucking beautiful idea.\n\n01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.540\nThat goes deep.\n\n01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.660\nCan you name the starting five of the 85 Lakers?\n\n01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:10.660\nYou named most of them already.\n\n01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.660\nThat's not the important thing.\n\n01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.780\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:19.420\nI just want to find out how much more of an American he is than we are.\n\n01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:24.260\nByron Scott, Michael Koopa, James Worthy, Karim Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, and then\n\n01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.860\nKurt Rambus on the bench.\n\n01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:26.860\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:30.940\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.420\nIs this just Lakers or are you a big sports guy?\n\n01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.420\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.420\nYou like sports.\n\n01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:36.420\nThat is the Showtime Lakers.\n\n01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.860\nI prefer it, but I know it's offensive.\n\n01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.700\nI prefer the Celtics of this era.\n\n01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.220\nOkay, now, name of starting five Celtics.\n\n01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:47.620\nBill Walden on the bench, Dennis Johnson, Larry Bird, Robert Parrish, Kevin McHale,\n\n01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:48.620\nDanny Ainge.\n\n01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:49.620\nFucking hell.\n\n01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.500\nWhat the hell?\n\n01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.740\nI don't understand.\n\n01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.580\nI don't understand anyone liking sports.\n\n01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.740\nI don't understand an immigrant knowing sports.\n\n01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:02.460\nIf you were ever going to like sports, that would have been the only time to like basketball.\n\n01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:07.100\nStop culture for us is sports, basketball is like the dopest of all the sports because\n\n01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.600\nof the culture.\n\n01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.980\nWhy would Germans be watching American sports?\n\n01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.220\nIt's cool.\n\n01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.220\nIt's just cool.\n\n01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:16.220\nNice dunking, cool swishing.\n\n01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.740\nIt's the 1992 Olympics.\n\n01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.740\nNice dunking, cool swishing.\n\n01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.240\nLucky struck.\n\n01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.860\nThat better be the fucking name of this episode.\n\n01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:29.140\nNice dunking, cool swishing.\n\n01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:34.420\nGeorge Comptroller, I'm going to decree that that is the title of this episode.\n\n01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.740\nBut it's crazy to recall the lineup of these teams.\n\n01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.060\nThese aren't current teams, right?\n\n01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:41.060\nNo, this is the 84, 85, 86.\n\n01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.060\nYes.\n\n01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.900\nWell, the 1992 dream team like changed my brain.\n\n01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.820\nSo like this is when this magic and Larry were old, but they were still on the team.\n\n01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:49.820\nThe Charles Barkley.\n\n01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:50.820\nCharles Barkley, common only.\n\n01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:51.820\nThis is when they were going to the Olympics.\n\n01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.820\nThey were going to basketball in the Olympics.\n\n01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.820\nYes.\n\n01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:54.820\nAngola.\n\n01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:55.820\nWhat do you know about Angola?\n\n01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:58.980\nI don't know anything about Angola, but they're in trouble, Charles Barkley.\n\n01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:04.820\nI can't remember that.\n\n01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:05.820\nIn 1982.\n\n01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:06.820\nI'm a fucking paradise right now.\n\n01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:07.820\nThis is great.\n\n01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:08.820\nWhatever.\n\n01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:15.340\nThe fact that this guy knows the starting six or five and then the bench, can you name\n\n01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:18.260\nanybody else off the bench of the Lakers or the Celtics back then?\n\n01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.780\nIn addition to those guys?\n\n01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:20.780\nYeah.\n\n01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:21.780\nNo.\n\n01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:22.780\nBut still the fact that you got those is outrageous.\n\n01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:23.780\nI love it.\n\n01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:24.780\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:25.780\nWho cares?\n\n01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:31.100\nWell, I mean, it's crazy to me because it speaks of a strange pocket of like, because\n\n01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:36.740\nI don't understand like the things that I committed to my memory at that age were so\n\n01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:37.740\ndifferent and I don't.\n\n01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:38.740\nYeah.\n\n01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:39.740\nI'm just fascinated by like.\n\n01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.580\nWell, you have different pockets than my pockets, right?\n\n01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.580\nRight.\n\n01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.580\nJust a pocket.\n\n01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:46.500\nIf you said I would be almost disgusted, I would take a shower from one of your knowledge\n\n01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.500\npockets.\n\n01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.500\nThank you.\n\n01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.500\nBut no, same thing.\n\n01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.500\nOkay.\n\n01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.500\nKnowledge pockets might be the title too.\n\n01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:57.860\nYeah, Dan, Dan, Dan, name the name the drop and loads guy from porn.\n\n01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.860\nThis is one of Dan's pockets.\n\n01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:00.860\nYeah.\n\n01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.980\nWell, I can't even remember.\n\n01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:03.980\nOkay.\n\n01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:04.980\nNo.\n\n01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:05.980\nI mean, what's his name?\n\n01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:06.980\nI don't know.\n\n01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:07.980\nDropping Nick Manning.\n\n01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:08.980\nThank you.\n\n01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:09.980\nNick Manning.\n\n01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:10.980\nIf you're out there.\n\n01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:11.980\nAre you all right?\n\n01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:18.420\nHe's dropping loads of loads of a note, so there's this porn star who when he's coming,\n\n01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.180\nhe says dropping loads.\n\n01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.820\nHe says the words dropping loads.\n\n01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:22.820\nYeah.\n\n01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.540\nDoes he pronounce the G?\n\n01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:25.540\nI think.\n\n01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:26.540\nYes.\n\n01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.540\nHard G.\n\n01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.540\nYes.\n\n01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:29.540\nHe says dropping loads.\n\n01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.540\nDropping loads.\n\n01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.540\nDropping loads.\n\n01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.540\nYes.\n\n01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.540\nLoads.\n\n01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.540\nLoads up.\n\n01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:35.540\nDropping loads.\n\n01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:36.540\nOh, you want a hard G.\n\n01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:40.660\nAnd then there's for instance, there's a porn where he plays Batman and he does say dropping\n\n01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:41.660\nbat loads.\n\n01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:47.900\nOh, he adds it like no he hooked into it and he's been on Howard Stern a million times\n\n01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:50.260\nor something, but he's kind of vanished.\n\n01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.260\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.260\nHe's out there somewhere.\n\n01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:53.260\nDropping loads.\n\n01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:54.260\nAre you okay?\n\n01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:55.260\nWe could hold.\n\n01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.260\nAnyway, but that's not important.\n\n01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.260\nHe's picking up loads.\n\n01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.260\nDropping.\n\n01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.660\nAll of the dropped ones.\n\n01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:00.660\nI get it.\n\n01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.660\nBut is it better if he says dropping with an apostrophe or dropping?\n\n01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.660\nWhat's less offensive?\n\n01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:06.860\nI don't think that matters.\n\n01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:09.700\nDropping loads.\n\n01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.020\nI think that's cuter.\n\n01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.020\nI agree.\n\n01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.020\nI think it's cuter.\n\n01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.020\nLess threatening.\n\n01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.020\nYeah, I'm just dropping.\n\n01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.020\nYeah.\n\n01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.020\nJust dropping a few loads off.\n\n01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.020\nYeah.\n\n01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.020\nHere's my YT.\n\n01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.020\nHere's my Carlos.\n\n01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.100\nIs it all right if I drop these loads?\n\n01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.020\nI've got so much to do.\n\n01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.020\nThat's hot.\n\n01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.020\nYeah.\n\n01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.220\nThat's his soft core porn work.\n\n01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.220\nYes.\n\n01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.220\nLike massage videos.\n\n01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.220\nShould I drop a load?\n\n01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.220\nNo.\n\n01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.220\nOkay.\n\n01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:38.860\nI was in a porn that was about a broken washing machine.\n\n01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:39.860\nYou were in a porn?\n\n01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:40.860\nYeah.\n\n01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.860\nAnd it was called unbalanced load.\n\n01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:42.860\nOh, come on.\n\n01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.860\nAll right.\n\n01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:48.140\nLet's do that.\n\n01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.340\nLet's start this exercise where I'm your hype man because I really think that this would\n\n01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.820\nbe therapeutic for me.\n\n01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:58.020\nAnd I find that profoundly inspiring what you said even though, and it actually is making\n\n01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:03.860\nme rethink sports as a utility because you were able to draw from your relationship with\n\n01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:10.100\nsports where you're like, oh yeah, this guy goes out there and he, for that person to\n\n01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:14.340\nknow, it's not his job to be a star is how I'm interpreting it.\n\n01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.340\nOh, I love this.\n\n01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:18.860\nThere's a heroism there that you can tap into where you're like, I am the hype man.\n\n01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.860\nOh, yes.\n\n01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:25.420\nAnd no matter what this bag of dicks that I'm hyping, it's not a two way thing.\n\n01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:28.660\nLike I'm not here to receive energy from my subject.\n\n01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.940\nI am here to hype.\n\n01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.940\nYes.\n\n01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.940\nI'm like a jack.\n\n01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.940\nIt lifts a car.\n\n01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:37.380\nIt doesn't ask the car if the car is liftable and if the car says, no, I'm feeling heavier\n\n01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.380\nthan usual.\n\n01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.620\nIf the jack doesn't go, fuck this, I quit.\n\n01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:41.620\nNo.\n\n01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.860\nIt's fucking like it's defined by it's jacking.\n\n01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:49.460\nYeah, it's just jacking off and going and then hyping, hype, hype, hype, hype, hype.\n\n01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.460\nAll right.\n\n01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.940\nSo like, I don't have to know anything about you.\n\n01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:55.140\nNo, it does not matter.\n\n01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.140\nYeah.\n\n01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:57.140\nBut so we do, we do a beat.\n\n01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:58.140\nYou know, okay.\n\n01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.140\nSo some questions, some tips.\n\n01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.140\nOkay.\n\n01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:03.420\nSo as we were saying before, only question, yes, yes, question and you add will not like\n\n01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.420\nthat.\n\n01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:09.380\nSo ask, ask, ask the questions and so they will say yes, no matter what.\n\n01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.260\nAnd then always something with two parts.\n\n01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:15.020\nSo they know the second part, you know, so like hip, hop.\n\n01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:16.940\nWhen I say hip, okay, okay.\n\n01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:17.940\nBut don't be confusing.\n\n01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:23.020\nIf you like, when I say pants, you say people don't know, right, right, right, right, right.\n\n01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.020\nDance.\n\n01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.740\nWe don't, we don't know what's happening, right.\n\n01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:30.020\nUnless you want to make a little curvy ball, a little Nolan Ryan action, they're very confused\n\n01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.020\nabout what is happening.\n\n01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.020\nA famous athlete.\n\n01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.020\nI'm sure.\n\n01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.020\nYeah.\n\n01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:35.020\nOkay.\n\n01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.020\nYeah.\n\n01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.020\nOkay.\n\n01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.020\nAll right.\n\n01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:39.020\nThat's another tip.\n\n01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:43.140\nSo only yes questions and no confusing call and response, like no, no mad libs where they\n\n01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.420\nhave to like puzzle it out.\n\n01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:45.420\nYeah.\n\n01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.420\nYeah.\n\n01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:47.420\nThis was no Sudoku.\n\n01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:48.420\nI have two and a one, three, three space.\n\n01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:49.420\nSpace.\n\n01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.420\nNo.\n\n01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:53.500\nIf the hands are in the air, should they care or not care?\n\n01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.500\nYeah.\n\n01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:58.860\nYou can even just say, wave your hands in the ear and then you can just watch them if\n\n01:06:58.860 --> 01:06:59.860\nyou like.\n\n01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:00.860\nRight.\n\n01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:02.260\nIs there, is there a way just between us?\n\n01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:03.260\nYeah.\n\n01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:06.140\nIs there a way to wave your hands in the air as if you do care?\n\n01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:07.140\nYes.\n\n01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.700\nI think that's the way to do it.\n\n01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:09.700\nYeah.\n\n01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.700\nWave your hands.\n\n01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:15.140\nObviously, I think wave your hands in the air, like it fucking matters, like it's obviously\n\n01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.460\nthat's been tried and like it didn't work.\n\n01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:18.460\nYeah.\n\n01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:23.260\nI've tried wave your hands like it's important for you and that it doesn't wave your hands\n\n01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.260\nin the air.\n\n01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:26.260\nLike this is the last time you'll have hands.\n\n01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:27.260\nYeah.\n\n01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.620\nObviously, that hasn't worked.\n\n01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:30.620\nIt doesn't rhyme.\n\n01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:31.620\nIt doesn't rhyme as much.\n\n01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:34.420\nIt is, it screams of like terror.\n\n01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:36.300\nIt's like after watching human centipede.\n\n01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.060\nThese kinds of screams is what you really get.\n\n01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.060\nOkay.\n\n01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:40.340\nIs there anything else or should we, should we try?\n\n01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:43.140\nI would say last thing is ask them to scream at the end.\n\n01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:44.140\nAsk them to scream?\n\n01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.140\nYeah.\n\n01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:46.140\nLike the end.\n\n01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.900\nBut only ask somebody to.\n\n01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:49.700\nAnd then don't ask everybody to.\n\n01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:56.340\nSomebody just ask somebody and then say anybody and then elevate it to everybody scream.\n\n01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.840\nOh, okay.\n\n01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.420\nBut not like somebody seemed like it's a treat to scream.\n\n01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.420\nYeah.\n\n01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:04.380\nAnd then start permitting more screaming.\n\n01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.740\nI want, I just want one person to scream.\n\n01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:08.740\nOkay.\n\n01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:11.240\nSo that's your choice.\n\n01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:17.700\nThen you're a great phase one hype man, like enjoy your low throttle hype.\n\n01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:21.740\nIf all I do in my life is make one person scream, but it was worthwhile then.\n\n01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:22.740\nGreat.\n\n01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:23.740\nEnjoy.\n\n01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:24.740\nHave you seen Joker?\n\n01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:25.740\nThat's I think was his goal.\n\n01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:26.740\nI haven't seen it yet.\n\n01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:27.940\nDon't spoil it for me.\n\n01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:28.940\nI won't.\n\n01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:29.940\nOkay.\n\n01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:33.540\nSo you, you have the, the, the, the rules now?\n\n01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:34.540\nYeah.\n\n01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:35.540\nYes.\n\n01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.860\nAnd I want you to challenge me.\n\n01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:44.620\nDon't take pity on me and bail me out by coming in and, and also being hype worthy.\n\n01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.620\nDon't hype man you.\n\n01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:46.620\nYeah.\n\n01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:47.620\nFor sure.\n\n01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:48.620\nDon't bail me out.\n\n01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:49.620\nLike I want to.\n\n01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:52.980\nAnd also, whatever you do MC wise, make sure that only comes from the hype that has been\n\n01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:54.620\ndriven by what Dan has created.\n\n01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.620\nYeah.\n\n01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:59.420\nWell, so there should be a thing like all of this has been about like the hype man introduction.\n\n01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:02.580\nAnd then they, and then the, and then the star kind of begins.\n\n01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:06.940\nI will tell you, so the star doesn't matter, but what your role as a hype man, what when\n\n01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:12.420\nthat, when that, when that person is now performing hydration, what's my job hydration?\n\n01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.420\nYes.\n\n01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.580\nAlways hydrate metaphorically or no for real.\n\n01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.140\nI just got a drink.\n\n01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.140\nOkay.\n\n01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:19.140\nIt's nine eleven.\n\n01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.140\nIt's nine eleven.\n\n01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.140\nOh, we get drop that beat.\n\n01:09:21.140

01:09:26.140\nOh, it's an odd.\n\n01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:27.140\nOkay.\n\n01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:34.140\nYeah, is everybody sitting in a theater tonight?\n\n01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:44.140\nGood, good,

As I said, it was a nice dunking cool swishing and it's become uh dunking and cool swishing\n\n01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:16.060\nit's become a very\n\n01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:21.820\nOver the last, you know decade or so has been a very european sport now and now the the us are sucking\n\n01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:26.540\nYeah, is that true? So what changed was it because of those olympics with the dream team?\n\n01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:33.260\nYes, yes, the olympics everyone's like only smokes. We can do this dirknowitzki top 10 basketball player of all time very german woodwood\n\n01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:35.580\nYeah, of course\n\n01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:42.540\nAnd so now all of this is like a very large percentage of foreign players spanish and uh, german argentina ever africa\n\n01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.700\nOh, yes, I have to say basketball\n\n01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:50.700\nJust about takes the cake as far as the intimidating sports like I could never intimidating\n\n01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:54.380\nYeah, because I could understand baseball and I could understand like okay\n\n01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:58.060\nI'm worse at hitting the ball. I'm worse at catching the ball, but if I get good at those things\n\n01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:01.100\nI can at least understand what's happening. Yes, but in basketball\n\n01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:06.780\nI they would pass me the ball and then I would start to do something on the whistle would blow and everyone would be like\n\n01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:13.500\nAre you fucking kidding me? And I'd be like what I don't understand like fundamentals then you got another ball has to bounce\n\n01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.900\nBut it has to bounce a certain amount\n\n01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:21.260\nI just I never got it baseball is nice because you can have one skill and then you can survive\n\n01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:26.780\nYou know, there's like a very old very large boys that can toss a ball accurately\n\n01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:32.140\nBut there's nothing they cannot run they cannot hit a stick with a head of a ball and is there any culture for\n\n01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.060\nAmerican baseball\n\n01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:37.900\nI say that like there's it's like soccer like there's a there's a european baseball\n\n01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:41.980\nIs that but it baseball is that is there any hope for that in europe? No\n\n01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:46.940\nPeople just look at that like we look at cricket and they go like I don't understand. Why are you doing that?\n\n01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:52.460\nThere's no history. You guys have I've watched Ken Burns baseball documentary, you know, it's like part of your history\n\n01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:59.740\nLike Lincoln and things we don't have this, you know, there's there's no like Goethe was like, you know trying to steal third\n\n01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:06.700\nYou know now he's writing poems how how insular to England is cricket is cricket viewed the same way by\n\n01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:10.140\nThe rest of Europe. Yes, I think it's England and then the colonies\n\n01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:15.500\nBut it's like an English thing so they're like if you say so\n\n01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:20.940\nSo yeah, it's it's like we invent these things we invent this set of rules and then we go\n\n01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:25.020\nThis is this is it's different from movie writing or TV show writing where you go like\n\n01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:29.900\nThis is a template for stories that are going to be improvised by people through their athletic prowess\n\n01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:36.380\nAnd you're you're actually creating you're kind of building the equivalent of multicamp sets for a sitcom and saying\n\n01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:38.860\nWings is going to be a hit\n\n01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:45.500\nLike like this is this is these are the rules like these people work for an airline and then they here's the commissary\n\n01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:51.100\nAnd they'll have will they won't they's over here and then they're like and you and and things take off or they don't\n\n01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:55.420\nBut like some people go like I don't understand football. I don't understand soccer\n\n01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:59.100\nI don't understand like cultures just either take it or they don't yeah\n\n01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:03.820\nI don't know how much of that is visceral and how much of that is just hegemonical if that's a word\n\n01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:07.100\nHow much of it is just like fucking forced down your throat? You will like soccer\n\n01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:11.820\nBecause that's what poor people can play in the street. And that's what all of these calling it, you know\n\n01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:19.260\nColonial powers like like like brought so the world loves soccer. All right. I'm sorry football football. Yeah, yeah\n\n01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:20.860\nbut\n\n01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:22.860\nthank you like\n\n01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:29.900\nLike that's like the big one that's like the water of sports like because you can play it anywhere anywhere everyone gets it\n\n01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:33.820\nIt's truly based on like just the prowess of people running back and forth\n\n01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:37.020\nUh, what are the what's my question?\n\n01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.260\nThat's a good guess for no question. Yes\n\n01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:47.180\nWhy I don't know it's just like it's weird. Why did we invent baseball? You saw the kin birds documentary?\n\n01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.660\nWhy did we I have a friend if I can interrupt for a second\n\n01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:54.540\nI go ahead a friend of mine who is from is a cricket fan a rugby rugby fan\n\n01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:57.900\nHe's from England. He's from like southern eastern\n\n01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:02.140\nSouthwestern England south northern west east. Yeah, he's like\n\n01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:03.100\nI\n\n01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:06.460\nWhat the fuck? I mean from Lyme Regis, but I think it's south southwest\n\n01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:12.540\nUh, he watched the kin burns documentary never knew anything about baseball and he watched it and he goes\n\n01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.460\nI'm a baseball fan now\n\n01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:19.500\nHe goes like that like that. He goes. I didn't realize the history behind the sport and if you\n\n01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:24.460\nSit and watch a cricket match with somebody who really loves cricket and they explain it to you\n\n01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:31.100\nYou become like kind of like you can become a fan of it just based on the weird minutiae of it all. Yes\n\n01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:37.980\nUm, I I don't I I don't I don't like the NFL. I stopped liking the NBA the major league baseball\n\n01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:42.540\nI don't like the way these clubs are ran and the owners are all a bunch of rich white assholes\n\n01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:44.700\nbut uh\n\n01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:47.900\nWhen you said kurt rambas that made me happy because when I was a kid\n\n01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:54.940\nThat was the greatest basketball of all time was the LA Lakers and the boston saltics and there was a time when\n\n01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:59.580\nTwo rivals would walk up and shake hands before the match\n\n01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:01.580\nYeah, and and then they\n\n01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:06.060\nMurdered each other. They hated each other. Yes, but before the match there was respect and stuff like that\n\n01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:09.020\nSo that I love the fact that you somebody who's not from here\n\n01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:13.580\nLike remembers like the teams from that like that's cool. I'm not a big sporty guy\n\n01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:18.460\nBut I do like when people play with honor and respect and you know dignity and stuff\n\n01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:22.620\nWell, they were not making many dollars, you know those even the baseball guys were like born\n\n01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:26.540\nStop they would play for the real team and then they would ride trains and play like tiny games\n\n01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:31.820\nThey're like strippers, you know, they just go here and do some stripping. They go to vegas, but off season tamper\n\n01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:37.660\nWhich guys are you referring to like like which was Larry birds in real like early baseball guys or early baseball?\n\n01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:43.580\nBut also basketball.

It was a roller coaster ride and that at one point\n\n01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:56.060\nHe was tapped to play in the Harlem Globetrotters, which is like it's like to imagine the the globetrotters are out there\n\n01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:58.060\nAre still being like the blue man group\n\n01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:03.100\nLike like I I'm so curious about what it takes to be a globetrotter\n\n01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:08.300\nAnd what their shows are like there are there you think they're still Harlem Globetrotters\n\n01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:16.220\nOh, yeah, and they're amazing and and and so you do you buy tickets like do they hold they must hold them at the same arenas as\n\n01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:21.580\nRegular sporting events, obviously. Yes, usually not the very large arenas, but slightly smaller\n\n01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:25.500\nBut yes, it's also like they're not the pro pros, but the people that don't like when I was a kid\n\n01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:28.940\nWe would go to the uh the la forum and see them play\n\n01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:35.180\nAnd it was like the circus meets sports and it was like they were clowns and and but also\n\n01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:39.420\nThey were ridiculously skilled because like meadowlark lemon and uh\n\n01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:43.340\nCurly like those guys the shit that they could do\n\n01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:49.340\nWas like a like a magic trick.

Well, that's why she could be Japanese and I might be racist\n\n01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:20.940\nBut it's a because I don't see anything\n\n01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.620\num\n\n01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:27.100\nLike but there's it's a whole youtube video of like her just doing that shit\n\n01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:30.540\nIt's like it's like the it's like the globetrotter version of parkour\n\n01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:36.620\nLike it's it's her like walking by a laundromat and then someone's like you forgot your jacket\n\n01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:42.380\nAnd then she throws a can of pepsi and the pepsi like hits a skateboarder and the jacket like hangs on a hook\n\n01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:44.460\nI I do a bad job of improvising that\n\n01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:49.020\nIt's all that that's like what dude perfect does.

Wow. What a what a what an impact? Yes. Uh, did that give you enough time?\n\n01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:52.140\nI got I got enough time. Yeah. Yeah, because because Cody eventually said to me, you know how that is\n\n01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:55.900\nI'm like, I don't care who it is. I'm just enjoying him and she's like\n\n01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:59.420\nThat's that's a Culkin. I'm like, all right. I'm glad I didn't know that\n\n01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:02.540\nI meant to die by you enough\n\n01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:08.140\nNo, no, no, you did not because I can only do one thing at once. Yeah, I'll cut it quick quick\n\n01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:13.820\nUh, I watched in the plane then I'll I'll solve for you. I watched in the plane ride home from Minneapolis this morning\n\n01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:16.700\nUh, the one of the two fire fest\n\n01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:21.900\nHulu is on the Delta flights. You saw that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that is uh\n\n01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:24.220\nIt's pretty fucked up\n\n01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:28.460\nThe tribal warfare between the two fire documentaries is really funny to me\n\n01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:34.060\nWe have friends who worked on one or the other and I'm always losing track\n\n01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:39.820\nI think I've seen them both and I think I'm pretty much like, yeah, I don't like we're not in the tank for either fire\n\n01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:43.420\nDocumentary it seems like fire. I don't think I don't think you need to see two of those\n\n01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:49.420\nI just want to find out like oh, it was a bunch of douchebags. So I think that's all you need to know out of that, right?\n\n01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:52.620\nIt's a that's a yeah, that's a fucked up glimpse at everything\n\n01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:58.940\nI did have a I had a weird experience where I was like because there's there's one of them where there's one of the\n\n01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:05.420\nGuys who like does the whole monologue about how he uh, he was he was allegedly willing to blow a guy for water\n\n01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:09.100\nAnd that that okay. I did not see that that's not the hulu one\n\n01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:15.420\nThat sounds like the better one if you see the clip the guy is like he becomes your hero\n\n01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:20.060\nBecause he's so sincere. He's like no, I like he's unapologetic about it\n\n01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:25.740\nHe's also not unapologetic in the 4chan way. He's just sort of he is who he is and he's like no\n\n01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:29.020\nSo and then I'm thinking okay. I'm gonna have to blow this guy in order to get water\n\n01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:34.700\nAnd and he just tells the story and you're kind of like oh god. There's something so refreshing about his sincerity\n\n01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:36.780\nHe would be a great hype man\n\n01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:43.260\nBut I was I I freak out\n\n01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:46.140\nI was saying that same thing\n\n01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:49.420\nI was at I was at a party and I was like talking about that\n\n01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:50.620\nI was like, oh, did you see that clip?\n\n01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:53.580\nBut I was telling somebody I was like this guy like he becomes your hero\n\n01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:59.260\nAnd I was just saying the same thing which I thought was like it's not that really that big a position and there was somebody there that was like\n\n01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:03.100\nThey chiseled away at it. They were like really those\n\n01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:08.620\nThose fucking people and that culture of this and that and they kind of like by the end of them speaking\n\n01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:11.420\nI was like, oh, yeah, I kind of bought into some bullshit\n\n01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:18.300\nLike I like like this person kind of like problematized my worship of some guy that was willing to suck dick for water on camera\n\n01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:25.500\nIt it it was it was an interesting experience. It made me withdraw more from humanity\n\n01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:32.220\nBecause you you really can't enjoy anything. Yeah, you can't you can't even just like poke your head out of the hole and go like\n\n01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:36.620\nThat charred human skin is glinting in the sunlight\n\n01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:42.700\nI'll call that a gem and then someone will go that makes you racist and you're like, you'll be big down here\n\n01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:49.420\nYou can poo poo on anything. It's what I've learned. Yeah, you can you can you can I don't want to call it\n\n01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:51.100\nprobabilizing because\n\n01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:59.340\nBecause that politicizes it, but I think it's like bubble bursting like people love to take down people love to they believe to be ironic\n\n01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:04.300\nYeah, you want to walk on to a playground where one thing is happening and you want to be the person that says\n\n01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:12.700\nWhat about the other thing? I can't believe people were upset when they found out blink 182 wasn't going to be there. That seems like\n\n01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:18.780\nThe greatest news I would have ever heard. I'm like, okay. I fucking would have paid double for that shit\n\n01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:24.780\nBlink 182 go fuck yourselves. Wow. I really wish I could remember the one thing\n\n01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:28.220\nI think I had one thing that I really wanted to get to and I can't remember\n\n01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:34.220\nThings all the small things not a good song. No, you don't enjoy it. I don't know who like is that a song?\n\n01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:38.860\nYes from blink 182. Can you sing it all the small things? That's it. That's the song\n\n01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:42.060\nWhen I say all things you say small\n\n01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:49.260\nYou can't even you can't that you no one has the will to hype man blink 182\n\n01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:51.820\nThey are their own hype men\n\n01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:58.700\nThey are what should we meet?

You can do this.

You know a water baby\n\n01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:37.980\nJeff Jeff Jeff hates to imagine dan in the pool. It's like it's a year long obsession\n\n01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:43.740\nWith dan not being a pool. He's more afraid of me being in a pool than I was of water\n\n01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:47.900\nBut when I first up dan at his new crib with the giant ass pool\n\n01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:52.620\nDan lives at a spanish resort apparently like like granada and uh\n\n01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:57.260\nHe uh, he had a little nose plugs, but now no nose plugs.
