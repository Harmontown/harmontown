WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.280
Hello gang, this show is not brought to you by Bud Light.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.280
What's good?

00:30.280 --> 00:39.040
From somewhere near downtown, Los Angeles, the city of angels in MacArthur Park, where

00:39.040 --> 00:51.920
I can indicate for some reason it's melting in the dark, Carmen Town is now in session.

00:51.920 --> 01:05.520
Spencer, motherfucking Corridandon, and the mayor of Carmen Town, the one and only Dan

01:05.520 --> 01:23.760
Carmel.

01:23.760 --> 01:31.080
You heard that, the song hiccups a little bit, you gotta support me if you want to comport

01:31.080 --> 01:32.080
me.

01:32.080 --> 01:39.920
Well, off to a bad start, I don't want to be here either, thank you for coming.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.720
I'm just kidding, I do want to be here, thank you for coming.

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
You want to be here.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.200
How many shows left are there?

01:44.200 --> 01:45.200
What's the time clock at?

01:45.200 --> 01:47.760
Six or something, I don't know.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.840
What would you say, Spencer?

01:48.840 --> 01:49.840
You're good at calendar math.

01:49.840 --> 01:55.320
I would say two plus four plus, I would say 15?

01:55.320 --> 01:57.320
That can't be right.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.200
Wow, that's a lot of shows.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.240
That's a lot of shows.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.240
That's terrible.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.960
That's like, what are we, figure skaters?

02:02.960 --> 02:07.400
But also, we should have ended the show like a year ago, look at these fucking crowds

02:07.400 --> 02:08.400
we're getting.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.400
I mean, there was like a good year or two, we're just knowing.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.400
We should have ended the show a long time ago.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.920
Yeah, we would have got our asses in seats.

02:13.920 --> 02:14.920
Yeah.

02:14.920 --> 02:19.960
Well, a lot of people are making pilgrimages, I mean, I just, I myself, I moved away from

02:19.960 --> 02:24.880
Los Feliz, so I'm not at the drawing room as much, I walked over there to meet, didn't

02:24.880 --> 02:29.760
walk over there, I, Dan, the details don't matter.

02:29.760 --> 02:33.720
I went into the drawing rooms to catch an Uber with Jeff to the show and there were

02:33.720 --> 02:37.880
several people, shout out to my miscreants from San Diego.

02:37.880 --> 02:38.880
Yeah.

02:38.880 --> 02:43.960
I got, I got, I got, we got Little Bear and Gage out there, we got, who else?

02:43.960 --> 02:47.280
I got patched into a Burning Man group.

02:47.280 --> 02:51.640
I've never been to Burning Man, but if I go, I have a patch that I can iron onto the back

02:51.640 --> 02:52.640
of my jacket.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.640
I should probably stitch it on.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.760
Little Bear and Gage, you out there?

02:56.760 --> 02:57.760
Yeah.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.760
All right.

02:58.760 --> 02:59.760
Yeah.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.600
Jen from Cincinnati was also at the bar.

03:01.600 --> 03:02.600
She was there.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.600
Jen, you with us?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.600
Okay.

03:04.600 --> 03:08.640
She's like a little quiet Dave Kline.

03:08.640 --> 03:09.640
Yep.

03:09.640 --> 03:14.000
And I also know, Jeff, you know, you're a big fan of my Instagram workout.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
I am.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.520
I trolled you all day today.

03:16.520 --> 03:17.520
Yeah.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.520
Whoa.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.680
Is MLE 805 here?

03:20.680 --> 03:21.680
Whoop.

03:21.680 --> 03:22.680
Whoop.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.680
Whoop.

03:23.680 --> 03:24.680
Whoop.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.680
Yeah.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.480
There's a lot of mini-upers out there.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.840
A lot of people coming out.

03:29.840 --> 03:34.480
Do you think our crowds are big now because this is the Dying Embers?

03:34.480 --> 03:35.960
This is the last two rounds?

03:35.960 --> 03:36.960
Yeah.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.400
Why would you go to something that was never ending?

03:39.400 --> 03:41.360
Are you going to miss it when it's gone, Dan?

03:41.360 --> 03:42.360
I'm sure.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.360
Yeah.

03:43.360 --> 03:44.360
Yeah.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.360
I'll miss it.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.360
But you'll be happy when it's over?

03:46.360 --> 03:47.360
Yeah.

03:47.360 --> 03:53.760
That's like the Sklar Brothers have a joke that when something is bad, your voice goes

03:53.760 --> 03:55.360
up when you're talking about it.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.360
You're like, oh, was that good?

03:56.360 --> 03:59.880
You're like, oh, yeah, it was great, but if it was actually good, you're like, that was

03:59.880 --> 04:00.880
great.

04:00.880 --> 04:01.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:01.880 --> 04:09.600
I was walking down the road in a Washington, D.C. and I hear Jeff Davis and there's Randy

04:09.600 --> 04:12.520
Sklar across the street from there.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.480
Don't twin high road us.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.360
You just say there was a Sklar.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.560
No, but no, but here's the thing.

04:19.560 --> 04:28.880
I had just five minutes before that was walking out of the elevator and I thought I saw a Sklar.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.560
And I was like, that guy looks a lot like a Sklar.

04:31.560 --> 04:35.640
I'm not sure which Sklar, but also I don't want a Sklar profile.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.600
You need to become a Sklar Sklar.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.480
That guy could just be any guy that looks a little bit like a Sklar.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.760
And then I heard Jeff Davis, it was Randy.

04:44.760 --> 04:48.520
And I don't know why Randy is the one I know right off the bat.

04:48.520 --> 04:53.240
But the one that I saw by the elevator was Jason and they had a show a block away from

04:53.240 --> 04:55.840
the hotel and they fucking killed it.

04:55.840 --> 04:56.840
They absolutely slaughtered.

04:56.840 --> 05:01.400
Okay, but to be clear, so you didn't know, you said you saw, I taught, I saw a Sklar

05:01.400 --> 05:02.400
at the elevator.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.400
I thought I saw.

05:03.400 --> 05:08.040
And the Randy story is they went, he went, Jeff and you went Sklar and he was like, Randy

05:08.040 --> 05:10.400
and you left that out because you wanted people to think.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.520
Can I be totally honest with you?

05:12.520 --> 05:13.520
No.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.520
Can I be it?

05:14.520 --> 05:15.520
No.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.520
I don't know, can you?

05:16.520 --> 05:17.520
Yes.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.480
Let me be quite honest about this.

05:20.480 --> 05:27.440
I thought there was a Sklar sighting, but it was in my really peripheral vision and that

05:27.440 --> 05:28.960
just passed.

05:28.960 --> 05:35.800
And then I was on the road and someone yelled my name out and it wasn't a real deal Sklar.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.400
And I wasn't totally sure which one it was.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.400
You just rolled the fucking dice.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.160
And I walked up and I go, hey, what's up?

05:42.160 --> 05:45.480
I said, I thought I saw Sklar walk up and he goes, yeah, you saw Jason, Randy let me

05:45.480 --> 05:50.600
hang off the hook, that's all, that's all you had to, yeah, okay.

05:50.600 --> 05:55.560
But now I think after hanging out with them individually that night, I think you bring

05:55.560 --> 05:56.920
any Sklar in here right now.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.800
I'll fucking tell you which one it is.

05:59.800 --> 06:03.680
I still can't tell the difference between the two guys that created HBO's animals.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.120
They worked in an office with me for years.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.160
They're not related.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.280
They just both had beards and I was like, guys, I'm sorry.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.960
Only one of them wore glasses, but now it's a fucking, who knows?

06:13.960 --> 06:14.960
That's the thing.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.960
That's the only trick.

06:15.960 --> 06:16.960
But now they both wear glasses.

06:16.960 --> 06:17.960
They both wear glasses.

06:17.960 --> 06:23.440
And I think Randy is the one that is more likely to wear a plaid.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.360
I think that's right.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.200
I think Jason likes his solids.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.200
I could tell.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.520
I could have Jason's a winter.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.720
I could imagine if I were a twin and the other one started wearing glasses, I would

06:33.720 --> 06:38.840
after a while, I'd take them to dinner and be like, how's your wife, how are your kids

06:38.840 --> 06:41.800
that are, are they identical to each other or me?

06:41.800 --> 06:45.120
Anyways, enough about that.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.560
What's with the glasses?

06:46.560 --> 06:49.200
Are you trying to be the smart twin?

06:49.200 --> 06:52.920
Is it okay if I wear, I would nip that in the bud.

06:52.920 --> 06:53.920
Right.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.920
Like I wouldn't mind any other gimmick, but if my twins started wearing glasses, I'd

06:57.920 --> 07:00.280
be like, I'm allowed to wear glasses too.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.280
Don't do that.

07:01.280 --> 07:05.880
Like I'm not going to be the fucking Simon of these chipmunks or wait, no, I'm sorry.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.880
You are going to be.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.120
I'm not going to let, I'm not going to be the fucking Alvin.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.200
I fucked it up.

07:12.200 --> 07:17.240
What if one just started wearing a monocle, but then if I know the scolaras and I think

07:17.240 --> 07:22.200
I kind of do now, they'll just fucking trade monocles and then you're fucked.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.200
Well, that would be cool.

07:23.200 --> 07:28.640
Like if you had a twin, I would, I would do like a Zorax and Xenon or whatever those

07:28.640 --> 07:29.640
guys were.

07:29.640 --> 07:33.520
Like one had a scar on one side of his face and the other had, let's do that.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.920
But then I got to remember which side the scar is on.

07:36.920 --> 07:42.400
No, no one does, but you would, you, you would, if someone had a scar on a different side

07:42.400 --> 07:45.520
of their face, you would be like, Oh, that's Randy for sure.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.520
Right.

07:46.520 --> 07:47.520
Like you, it would just, yeah, it would work.

07:47.520 --> 07:48.760
I would think them unidentical.

07:48.760 --> 07:53.320
I'm not going to enumerate what I think are the differences between them, but I think

07:53.320 --> 07:57.400
I could, I can totally nail who is which right now.

07:57.400 --> 08:01.520
Jason used to be the one with glasses and now they both got glasses.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.480
Because Randy was like, what are you trying to pull?

08:03.480 --> 08:04.960
I'm not the meat heads, Clara.

08:04.960 --> 08:05.960
That's not.

08:05.960 --> 08:09.440
And then later it's like, I've had it up to here with these glasses.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.440
All right.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.440
Sclars, sclars, whatever.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.440
You're off the hook.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.440
You can go see them anytime you want.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.440
They're never going to quit.

08:16.440 --> 08:20.880
They're going to be here forever.

08:20.880 --> 08:21.880
You're going to get sick of them.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.800
They're going to ring your doorbell.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.800
Me, I'm Salinger.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.520
You're going to hunt me down.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.080
Pay attention to me.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.080
What I'm talking about.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.080
You're talking about the Sclars.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.080
All right.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.080
Shut up.

08:33.080 --> 08:40.360
When Harmontown is dead and dusted and all gone away, are you going to ever wish that

08:40.360 --> 08:45.600
you had this platform, this microphone, this audience again?

08:45.600 --> 08:48.640
Are you going to be quite happy that it's...

08:48.640 --> 08:52.280
This doesn't seem that difficult to reattain.

08:52.280 --> 08:57.440
Do you think I'm being naive about that?

08:57.440 --> 09:00.840
Because if anyone thinks I'm being naive about that, because I know that it would be naive

09:00.840 --> 09:03.640
if I was like, well, I could just do it again.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.640
Okay.

09:04.640 --> 09:09.680
So you're saying that if you ever wanted to do it, you would do it in some other format

09:09.680 --> 09:10.680
or...

09:10.680 --> 09:11.680
Or the same format.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.720
It's just the cables that you plugged in, you plug them in again.

09:15.720 --> 09:16.720
Check, check.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.720
Hey, hello.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.720
Well, we'll do, but do.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.320
It's not that hard.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.200
I never stapled a flyer to a telephone pole.

09:25.200 --> 09:30.800
Like, you make a couple TV shows, people will show up.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.760
Not as many as when you say you're not going to do it anymore.

09:33.760 --> 09:43.120
Let's just ride this wave, finish up, we'll take six weeks.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.120
Classic Coke, baby.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.120
Motherfucker.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.160
Always, always thinking.

09:48.160 --> 09:52.040
I like to imagine that the audience, when they were laughing, they were laughing at

09:52.040 --> 09:53.040
your audacity.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.080
Like, they're like, we're not going to fucking be here.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.720
You fucking kidding me?

09:56.720 --> 10:00.040
We're fucking out.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.520
I mean, I'm sure they aren't, but it's fun to imagine.

10:03.520 --> 10:07.840
I hope everybody listening calls that bluff, but nobody ever shows up again.

10:07.840 --> 10:14.400
I almost distracted because I'm like, when we have a guest who I'm like, well, this

10:14.400 --> 10:18.440
is a guest in a stricter sense, like, probably not a fan of the show.

10:18.440 --> 10:23.880
They're just like a person that it would be a delight to talk to, and this is their first

10:23.880 --> 10:24.880
time being here.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.920
They don't know anything about the show, and then I listened to this first eight minutes

10:27.920 --> 10:32.000
of the show through their ears in the green room, and I'm like, why couldn't I be out

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
there for this?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Why is this?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.720
Why is it important that I be sequestered and then brought out?

10:36.720 --> 10:38.220
The answer is, I don't know.

10:38.220 --> 10:43.840
What is it that separates the guest part of the show from the non-guest part?

10:43.840 --> 10:46.200
I like to think it eats up more time this way.

10:46.200 --> 10:50.640
Yeah, it's probably just, maybe I'm warming you guys up.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.600
I'm the world's worst MC.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.600
They're back there going, thank God.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.600
I don't want to go out there cold.

10:57.600 --> 11:04.200
Like, old school, like, Carson, or, like, Leno, like, monologue bits, like, like, what's

11:04.200 --> 11:05.200
in the news?

11:05.200 --> 11:07.680
Okay, well, let me, okay, well, I gotta go, we're breaking news.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.920
Turkey and Syria are in the news today.

11:09.920 --> 11:10.920
What's going on?

11:10.920 --> 11:11.920
Well, hold on, hold on.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.280
There's gotta be something funny there.

11:14.280 --> 11:17.880
That's a good idea.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.160
Jeff's got a good idea there.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.000
Okay, well, there's no internet here.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.800
Okay, so what do you want?

11:22.800 --> 11:24.600
I've got musical lead in.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.600
Oh.

11:25.600 --> 11:30.920
I mean, just freestyle some good old-fashioned topical humor.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.800
Like, you know, Jack, Benny, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno.

11:34.800 --> 11:42.000
Like, okay, well, maybe it's like a, can it just be placeholder, like, we're in a parallel

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
dimension.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Sure.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
We don't know.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.520
Okay, so, you just want the cadence of, like, an opening monologue.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.520
It's tonight.

11:48.520 --> 11:49.520
Right.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.600
You know, and, like, Joan Embry from the San Diego Zoo.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.600
Right.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.600
And here he is, Dan Harmon.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.600
Right.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.600
Whoa.

11:58.600 --> 12:04.600
Picture a red, a red curtain opening.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.600
Dan leans over and waves to the band.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.600
Here we go.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.600
Yeah.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.760
Thank you very much.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.480
I know you were paid to react that way.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.480
What's going on?

12:17.480 --> 12:18.480
You're already there.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.480
Wow.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.640
Ukraine madness.

12:21.640 --> 12:28.640
I'm more familiar with the Ukraine now than I am my hometown, Jeff.

12:28.640 --> 12:34.640
Uh, and what's your hometown again?

12:34.640 --> 12:35.640
Ukraine.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.640
I wish I knew.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.640
Okay.

12:37.640 --> 12:44.040
So you could throw that to a room, if there's a town in Ukraine, then it would be funny.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.040
Yeah.

12:45.040 --> 12:48.600
We could play a little hometown, and then you go and I go, Zalinksk, you know, and it's

12:48.600 --> 12:49.600
like, chuckle.

12:49.600 --> 12:53.720
I'm saying, if you just said, you forgot your hometown, you said it was the Ukraine.

12:53.720 --> 12:54.720
Boom.

12:54.720 --> 12:55.720
Laugh.

12:55.720 --> 12:56.720
Right.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.720
Next joke.

12:57.720 --> 12:58.720
So I fucked up.

12:58.720 --> 12:59.720
I fucked up.

12:59.720 --> 13:00.720
No, no, no, no.

13:00.720 --> 13:01.720
No, no.

13:01.720 --> 13:02.720
You're nailing it so far.

13:02.720 --> 13:03.720
So next joke.

13:03.720 --> 13:04.720
Okay.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.880
So just like, let's take it back.

13:07.880 --> 13:11.600
I remember a real joke that Carson did that I never understood.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.600
Okay.

13:12.600 --> 13:16.680
And I want to do it.

13:16.680 --> 13:21.280
I remember I was obsessed with Carson because I have dim memories of right before Letterman

13:21.280 --> 13:26.480
like started and it was just like, I was obsessed with Carson, then I immediately became obsessed

13:26.480 --> 13:27.480
with Letterman.

13:27.480 --> 13:32.440
But like, it was like, I remember watching Carson and I was just a kid, it was just obsessed

13:32.440 --> 13:37.200
with the idea of, of like making people happy and like performing and things, but I didn't

13:37.200 --> 13:39.560
understand any of the jokes.

13:39.560 --> 13:45.000
And I, but I would then later I would understand the jokes, I'd go, well, I understand that

13:45.000 --> 13:50.320
like Shelly Winters is famous for being fat, I can figure this out.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.040
We didn't have the internet, but there was like an encyclopedia, you could look up Shelly

13:53.040 --> 13:57.640
Winters and say fat.

13:57.640 --> 13:58.640
She didn't deserve it.

13:58.640 --> 13:59.640
It was a terrible time.

13:59.640 --> 14:03.280
Like there was no shame and that included everybody.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.880
Academy award-winning actress.

14:04.880 --> 14:05.880
Yeah.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.520
It was like, if you were a man that dressed like a woman, people would be like, oh, that's

14:08.520 --> 14:09.520
hilarious.

14:09.520 --> 14:10.520
And it was like problematic.

14:10.520 --> 14:11.960
So we figured that out later over time.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.480
It took an internet.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.600
There was this show Mash and there was, there was a character on it.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.440
He dressed like a lady and it was like funny at everybody all the time.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.360
Now he'd be brave and you would be an asshole.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.360
All right.

14:22.360 --> 14:27.760
So anyways, the, this is the joke that he did.

14:27.760 --> 14:33.040
He was like, like, he was in his model, like I said, boy, you know, it's a, it's a, it's

14:33.040 --> 14:37.880
been, there's been so much smog in Burbank, but it's cleared up, Ed, it's all, it's all

14:37.880 --> 14:38.880
cleared up.

14:38.880 --> 14:45.640
There was so much, so much, so much smog in, in, in, in Burbank, but then it cleared up.

14:45.640 --> 14:53.040
Today, a, a, reportedly a, there was a robin that saw it was eating a worm and spit it

14:53.040 --> 14:54.040
out.

14:54.040 --> 15:03.560
I was like, I don't understand, are you saying it's been so smoggy?

15:03.560 --> 15:08.240
Is your joke how smoggy it is or is your joke how smoggy it's been?

15:08.240 --> 15:13.600
It's been so smoggy that all birds in Burbank, like, have never known they've been eating

15:13.600 --> 15:15.200
worms, which they do all over the world.

15:15.200 --> 15:19.160
Or is that worms are notorious for eating smog?

15:19.160 --> 15:20.440
Are you sure that's the joke?

15:20.440 --> 15:21.440
Well, that's all right.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.120
I'm not sure are you, that is the actual joke.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.200
I can't be 100% sure.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.720
Let's bring our guest out.

15:27.720 --> 15:29.080
He's going to clarify everything.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.080
He's German.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.080
He's a YouTuber.

15:31.080 --> 15:35.520
Uh, I wonder if YouTuber is like a point of offense for, for people at all.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.960
Let's talk to him about that and more.

15:38.960 --> 15:47.000
Please welcome someone who I was shocked to see how tall he was because it's just YouTube

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
and stuff.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.640
And then you just see a head and then you're like, whoa, that head's far off the floor.

15:52.640 --> 16:08.680
Please welcome the illustrious, the talented, the intriguing, Mr. Flula Borg.

16:08.680 --> 16:20.960
Flula, pick a seat.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.240
You can sit anywhere you want.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.680
That's best for camera.

16:23.680 --> 16:24.680
Interesting.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.000
He chose the middle seat.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.760
What does it say about that means?

16:28.760 --> 16:30.000
Yeah, I need Spencer.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.320
Oh boy.

16:31.320 --> 16:35.560
No one ever chooses that cool.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.800
Were you talking about Tomax and Samot?

16:37.800 --> 16:39.960
Yes, Tom, they might.

16:39.960 --> 16:40.960
Yes.

16:40.960 --> 16:41.960
Yes.

16:41.960 --> 16:42.960
Yes.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.960
The scar twice.

16:43.960 --> 16:44.960
Yes.

16:44.960 --> 16:45.960
Yes.

16:45.960 --> 16:46.960
Scarp brothers.

16:46.960 --> 16:47.960
Were you a GI Joe guy?

16:47.960 --> 16:48.960
Yes.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.160
Was that how you grew up in Germany?

16:50.160 --> 16:51.520
I did grow up in Germany.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.520
Oh, sorry.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.520
Improv.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.520
Yes, and?

16:54.520 --> 16:55.520
Yes, I left.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.520
And are you next Poland?

16:56.520 --> 16:57.520
No, no, no.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.520
Yes, and?

16:58.520 --> 16:59.520
No, yes, and for German.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.520
No, no, no.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.520
Listen.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.520
Yes.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.520
Never.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.520
We tried it twice.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.520
Sometimes not to try.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.520
Yes.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.520
So they didn't land.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.520
Yes, and?

17:08.520 --> 17:10.520
That's a World War II joke.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.520
No, no.

17:11.520 --> 17:12.520
You grew up in Germany.

17:12.520 --> 17:16.440
Sorry again for everything.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.640
But were you like Hasbro age in Germany?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.760
I don't know when you left Germany.

17:20.760 --> 17:21.760
I thought it.

17:21.760 --> 17:22.760
I thought that was like an insult.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.760
Like, was I a has been before I ended here?

17:24.760 --> 17:25.760
So it's like second career.

17:25.760 --> 17:26.760
Let's try it.

17:26.760 --> 17:27.760
YouTube.

17:27.760 --> 17:28.760
Subscribe.

17:28.760 --> 17:29.760
Hasbro.

17:29.760 --> 17:30.760
The manufacturers of GI Joe.

17:30.760 --> 17:31.760
Yes.

17:31.760 --> 17:32.760
Hasbro.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.760
Yes.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.760
Yes.

17:34.760 --> 17:35.760
Yes.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.760
I played with the GI Joe's, the GI Joe's, and also mask.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.760
Do you guys remember?

17:37.760 --> 17:38.760
Mask.

17:38.760 --> 17:39.760
I was in the mask.

17:39.760 --> 17:40.760
Oh, I'm a 57 Chevy socket.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.760
I'm a tank.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.760
Yeah.

17:42.760 --> 17:43.760
What was the theme song of the mask?

17:43.760 --> 17:44.760
I used to know it.

17:44.760 --> 17:45.760
Mask.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.760
Mask.

17:46.760 --> 17:47.760
It's the song.

17:47.760 --> 17:50.760
Almost GI Joe.

17:50.760 --> 17:51.760
Mask.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.760
No, we're sorry.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.760
We wish we were GI Joe.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.760
It was basically like GI Joe, but not military.

17:59.760 --> 18:00.760
Yes.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.760
Take out those fucking drums.

18:02.760 --> 18:03.760
No, add a laser.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.760
Yeah.

18:04.760 --> 18:05.760
Maybe Democrats have kids too.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.760
Let's fucking like these guys are financed by a philanthropist.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.760
Oh, I had the dude, the do cockroach tank.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.760
Did you have that?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.760
It was wonderful.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.260
That is some fast fucking connection shit,

18:19.260 --> 18:20.900
not to ruin your joke by analyzing it,

18:20.900 --> 18:23.900
but that was some lightning fast ethernet

18:23.900 --> 18:25.420
fucking joke crafting.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.060
Not a joke, I actually had the Dukakis tank.

18:27.060 --> 18:29.060
You just heard Democrat fucking thing

18:29.060 --> 18:30.780
and you were like, Dukakis tank, fucking.

18:30.780 --> 18:34.160
I'm sorry, I followed the 1988 presidential election closely.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.740
Who is Dukakis' running mate?

18:38.740 --> 18:41.740
Oh yeah, Monroe, Earl Monroe, Earl the Pearl.

18:41.740 --> 18:42.700
Wait, was it?

18:42.700 --> 18:45.420
Lloyd Benson, Lloyd Benson, fine.

18:45.420 --> 18:46.580
Was it, wait, wait, who was it?

18:46.580 --> 18:47.940
Geraldine Ferrara.

18:47.940 --> 18:49.580
Yeah, okay, yes, Geraldine Ferrara.

18:49.580 --> 18:51.060
I just wanted to know if he knew more about

18:51.060 --> 18:52.980
our politics than we did.

18:52.980 --> 18:54.860
Finger roll like a sucker.

18:56.060 --> 18:58.460
But I didn't have to get hung up on my question,

18:58.460 --> 19:01.540
but I just want to know, were you like 10 years old

19:01.540 --> 19:03.660
in Germany, but into G.I. Joe?

19:03.660 --> 19:05.500
Everything is very torty in Germany.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.900
We've just received lethal weapon four.

19:07.900 --> 19:10.100
So it takes a long, long time.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.020
Is there a funny title in German?

19:12.020 --> 19:15.400
I like when movie titles are different in other languages.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.240
Yes.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.060
Would you like an example?

19:17.060 --> 19:17.900
Yes, I would.

19:17.900 --> 19:18.740
Great.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.860
It's so diligent.

19:19.860 --> 19:21.460
Yes, I fucking would.

19:21.460 --> 19:24.060
My most favorite of the films is Die Horde,

19:24.060 --> 19:25.860
starring Hans Gruber and Who Gives a Shit.

19:25.860 --> 19:26.700
Right.

19:26.700 --> 19:27.540
Right.

19:27.540 --> 19:28.540
Who Gives a Shit.

19:28.540 --> 19:29.380
Right.

19:29.380 --> 19:30.220
Who Gives a Shit.

19:30.220 --> 19:31.060
Right.

19:31.060 --> 19:34.660
Does Gruber mean something in German?

19:34.660 --> 19:35.500
Yeah, legend.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.340
Jesus.

19:36.340 --> 19:37.180
Jesus.

19:37.180 --> 19:38.020
Yeah.

19:39.940 --> 19:42.020
It's just, it's when you get an SUV at Uber,

19:42.020 --> 19:43.620
it's like when you're traveling with friends.

19:43.620 --> 19:44.460
All right.

19:44.460 --> 19:45.740
Oh, to answer your question,

19:45.740 --> 19:47.500
Die Horde in German, Die Horde,

19:47.500 --> 19:49.740
which would mean like die with difficulty,

19:49.740 --> 19:50.780
which who cares?

19:50.780 --> 19:51.620
Right.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.580
So we have changed it to Stirb Langsam,

19:53.580 --> 19:55.300
which means die slowly.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.140
Oh!

19:56.140 --> 19:57.460
Is that true?

19:57.460 --> 19:58.660
Yeah, I have the movie poster.

19:58.660 --> 19:59.500
I took a photo of it.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.340
Die slowly!

20:00.340 --> 20:01.180
Would you like to see it?

20:01.180 --> 20:02.340
I have the movie poster in my living room.

20:02.340 --> 20:03.260
What?

20:03.260 --> 20:06.620
He just went to an Aztec fan-y bag.

20:06.620 --> 20:08.340
I just happened to take a photo.

20:08.340 --> 20:12.180
And produced a cultural recreation or whatever you call it.

20:12.180 --> 20:14.380
Yeah, I mean die slowly.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.220
Die slowly.

20:15.220 --> 20:16.060
I'm assuming I...

20:16.060 --> 20:16.900
Die slowly, Stirb Langsam.

20:16.900 --> 20:17.740
That is really funny.

20:17.740 --> 20:18.580
This was not planned.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.500
I just take a photo of it every morning as I wake up.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.340
Ssh.

20:21.340 --> 20:22.660
Ssh.

20:22.660 --> 20:23.660
Stirb Langsam.

20:23.660 --> 20:24.500
Ssh.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.340
Langsam.

20:25.340 --> 20:26.180
Stirb Langsam.

20:26.180 --> 20:27.020
Die slowly!

20:27.020 --> 20:27.860
Die slowly.

20:27.860 --> 20:28.700
My skyscraper.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.940
Wait, is that a command or is that something like,

20:30.940 --> 20:32.860
what if you just died less fast?

20:32.860 --> 20:35.180
When spoken in German, it's always a command.

20:35.180 --> 20:36.020
Yeah.

20:36.020 --> 20:36.860
Yeah.

20:36.860 --> 20:37.700
Yeah.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.340
Yeah, we don't have requests.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.820
Right.

20:41.820 --> 20:42.780
There's no eye and team.

20:42.780 --> 20:45.060
There's no requests in German.

20:45.060 --> 20:46.300
Germany learned the hard way

20:46.300 --> 20:48.700
that if you ask permission, you just end up...

20:48.700 --> 20:49.540
Twice.

20:49.540 --> 20:50.620
Sorry again.

20:50.620 --> 20:51.580
What was...

20:51.580 --> 20:53.140
Oh, would you like another one?

20:53.140 --> 20:54.580
Give me three million of them.

20:54.580 --> 20:55.740
Okay, great. Here's number one.

20:55.740 --> 20:56.740
Okay.

20:56.740 --> 20:57.580
Gorillas.

20:57.580 --> 20:59.860
Oh, do you have no, the gorillas in the mist

20:59.860 --> 21:01.620
with the lady and the monkeys?

21:01.620 --> 21:02.940
Diane Farsi, I think it was right.

21:02.940 --> 21:03.940
Yeah, Diane Farsi.

21:03.940 --> 21:06.140
It was Sigourney Weaver, is it?

21:06.140 --> 21:08.060
Yes, yes, that one.

21:08.060 --> 21:10.300
So if you say gorillas in the mist in German,

21:10.300 --> 21:13.260
it literally means gorillas in the manure.

21:13.260 --> 21:14.340
Because mist means manure?

21:14.340 --> 21:15.380
Yes, excellent.

21:15.380 --> 21:17.340
So we have changed it.

21:17.340 --> 21:18.620
Excellent.

21:18.620 --> 21:19.460
We have changed it.

21:19.460 --> 21:20.460
Diane, you're now German.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.340
Rosetta Stein, I like it.

21:23.820 --> 21:25.420
Gorillas in Nebel, we changed it,

21:25.420 --> 21:27.100
which means gorillas in the fog,

21:27.100 --> 21:28.940
which sounds like a weather forecast.

21:28.940 --> 21:29.780
Right.

21:29.780 --> 21:31.220
Gorillas in the fog.

21:31.220 --> 21:32.140
Gorillas in the fog.

21:32.140 --> 21:33.940
I think I may have mentioned this in the show before.

21:33.940 --> 21:38.300
I was in Italy and Hutzucker Proxy was out in theaters,

21:38.300 --> 21:40.060
and it was called Mr. Hula Hoop.

21:40.060 --> 21:41.500
Yeah.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.180
Spoiler!

21:43.180 --> 21:44.380
Holy shit.

21:44.380 --> 21:45.660
We just need direct reasons.

21:45.660 --> 21:46.580
Why should we watch this?

21:46.580 --> 21:47.580
Hula Hoops.

21:47.580 --> 21:50.060
In China, I think Leafa Leppin was called

21:50.060 --> 21:52.620
Heavenly Sounding Cannon or something great.

21:52.620 --> 21:53.660
That's a better movie.

21:53.660 --> 21:54.660
Much better.

21:54.660 --> 21:55.380
Yeah.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.460
Heavenly Sounding Cannon 2.

21:57.460 --> 21:58.580
I'm into it.

21:58.580 --> 21:59.340
Two cannons.

21:59.340 --> 22:00.860
Two cannons.

22:00.860 --> 22:03.660
How old were you when you left Germany?

22:03.660 --> 22:06.420
I left as an adult who could vote

22:06.420 --> 22:08.340
and have beverages for adults,

22:08.340 --> 22:09.740
which I guess is 12 in Germany.

22:09.740 --> 22:11.420
So I left after this.

22:11.420 --> 22:12.260
Yes.

22:12.260 --> 22:13.700
So your family moved?

22:13.700 --> 22:14.900
You weren't like a runaway?

22:14.900 --> 22:15.740
I was not a runaway.

22:15.740 --> 22:17.380
No solo asylum for this one.

22:17.380 --> 22:18.540
Yeah, no.

22:18.540 --> 22:21.020
I did just come to try to become a hype man

22:21.020 --> 22:22.900
for hip-hop concerts.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.060
So that's why I moved here.

22:24.060 --> 22:26.620
And then I won a contest for hype men,

22:26.620 --> 22:29.220
and then I stayed.

22:29.220 --> 22:33.540
What is the ingredient for being a great hype man?

22:33.540 --> 22:35.660
No understanding of anything.

22:35.660 --> 22:37.460
Just you need to not know anything.

22:37.460 --> 22:38.060
Yes, Andy.

22:38.060 --> 22:38.860
Yes, Andy.

22:38.860 --> 22:40.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like that's perfect.

22:40.260 --> 22:44.580
Is this flavor-flav, the Thomas Edison of hype men?

22:44.580 --> 22:45.980
Yes, he's the Thomas Edison.

22:45.980 --> 22:47.340
Yeah, yeah, he's the Thomas Edison.

22:47.340 --> 22:49.660
Do you have to throw in a yeah boy?

22:49.660 --> 22:51.860
You can go yeah boy, you can go yeah girl.

22:51.860 --> 22:54.260
You sometimes just be like, yeah.

22:54.260 --> 22:59.100
I hate to put you on the spot, Lula, but can you hype me?

22:59.100 --> 23:00.260
If I, like, like, wait.

23:00.260 --> 23:00.820
Oh, yeah.

23:00.820 --> 23:02.260
Yes.

23:02.260 --> 23:03.300
Yes.

23:03.300 --> 23:06.020
Because it shouldn't matter, right, who I am or what I'm doing.

23:06.020 --> 23:06.820
It should not matter.

23:06.820 --> 23:09.420
I think in German they call it ja und.

23:09.420 --> 23:10.540
Ja und, ja und.

23:10.540 --> 23:12.340
Was her sand.

23:12.340 --> 23:14.220
Well, can you give us a beat, and then

23:14.220 --> 23:17.100
Flula will hype man me, and then.

23:17.100 --> 23:18.300
Oh, there are beats in this place?

23:18.300 --> 23:18.900
You have beats?

23:18.900 --> 23:19.380
Yeah.

23:19.380 --> 23:21.660
Yeah, we do.

23:21.660 --> 23:23.860
Oh, yeah, baby, baby.

23:23.860 --> 23:26.020
How are you doing tonight, Mr. Teibreiter?

23:26.020 --> 23:28.100
Mrs. Teibreiter?

23:28.100 --> 23:30.980
Yeah, get ready for a wonderful adventure.

23:30.980 --> 23:32.660
Not in a city, not in a village.

23:32.660 --> 23:36.460
No assholes in the town.

23:36.460 --> 23:40.860
When I say dead, you say home, dead, dead.

23:40.860 --> 23:47.420
When I say mud, you say town, mud, mud, dead home.

23:47.420 --> 23:48.940
Yo.

23:48.940 --> 23:51.940
It's a lot of calling, and then also saying it.

23:51.940 --> 23:52.740
It's very simple.

23:52.740 --> 23:57.380
Sleepy time, taking a nap, doing everything I can in my lab.

23:57.380 --> 23:59.500
When I finish, I go to sleep.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.740
Sleepy town.

24:01.740 --> 24:02.500
Yo.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.540
I was just trying to challenge you.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.820
Yeah, I was like doing your height.

24:06.820 --> 24:09.460
Well, no, I was saying, like, the hype man equivalent

24:09.460 --> 24:12.100
of doing sit-ups with someone sitting on your chest

24:12.100 --> 24:14.540
would be the sleepiest rapper.

24:14.540 --> 24:17.420
And then you're the hype man for a sad, sleepy.

24:17.420 --> 24:19.100
Like, I'm not doing you any favors.

24:19.100 --> 24:19.860
Oh, I love it, though.

24:19.860 --> 24:22.140
Like, I can imagine Flavor Flav would be like Chuck

24:22.140 --> 24:22.940
after the show.

24:22.940 --> 24:28.060
He'd be like, yo, Chuck, you think you can meet me halfway?

24:28.060 --> 24:29.060
This is why I love this.

24:29.060 --> 24:29.620
I don't care.

24:29.620 --> 24:32.820
If you go halfway, I get very excited to go 150%.

24:32.820 --> 24:34.740
All right, well, I'm going to commit to sale.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.900
OK, all right, here we go.

24:36.900 --> 24:39.580
Space is fun to go to.

24:39.580 --> 24:41.780
I'm rapping like a go-to rapper.

24:41.780 --> 24:42.780
Can't breathe some space.

24:45.780 --> 24:48.220
Going to go to space, go to a planet.

24:48.220 --> 24:52.420
I haven't even had it so good in a year.

24:52.420 --> 24:54.420
I fucked your mama from ear to ear.

24:54.420 --> 24:57.380
Matthew McConaughey into Stella, feeling so good

24:57.380 --> 24:58.780
from the floor to the cellar.

24:58.780 --> 25:03.060
Damn!

25:03.060 --> 25:06.140
Flowing to the cellar, go in underground, go for a wine.

25:06.140 --> 25:07.180
Look at what I found.

25:07.180 --> 25:08.180
Got a quartet.

25:08.180 --> 25:09.540
Natalie Portman wasn't roaming.

25:09.540 --> 25:11.540
Oh my god, sleepy like Melatonin.

25:11.540 --> 25:13.540
Dan Harmon.

25:13.540 --> 25:14.540
Dan Harmon.

25:14.540 --> 25:15.540
Yeah, yeah.

25:15.540 --> 25:17.540
Dan Harmon.

25:17.540 --> 25:18.540
Dan Harmon.

25:18.540 --> 25:20.100
Dippy, dippy, dippy, dippy, dippy.

25:20.100 --> 25:25.740
Dan Harmonie, Dan Harmonie, Dan Harmonie, Dan what?

25:25.740 --> 25:27.940
Taking a nap, going out.

25:27.940 --> 25:28.940
Taking no crap.

25:28.940 --> 25:32.460
Eight hours of sleep, eight, eight hours of sleep.

25:32.460 --> 25:33.700
Bram-cycle, eight hours of sleep.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.540
That's what they say you need, motherfucker.

25:36.540 --> 25:38.020
Bram-cycle, fuckers.

25:43.300 --> 25:46.540
Incredible hypemanship.

25:46.540 --> 25:47.380
Yes, thank you.

25:47.380 --> 25:51.580
Unmistakably, like completely autonomous of the,

25:51.580 --> 25:54.980
it's like you are radiating hype.

25:54.980 --> 26:01.580
Oops, that's not a note, that's your five star review.

26:01.580 --> 26:02.580
Oh, thank you.

26:02.580 --> 26:09.420
Yeah, I guess what I'm learning is that the hype man doesn't have to be just a sidekick.

26:09.420 --> 26:12.700
The hype man can be his own like soloist.

26:12.700 --> 26:16.060
Yes, it's like if you've spilled some Gatorade on the floor, where does it go?

26:16.060 --> 26:17.540
It's any place, who knows.

26:17.540 --> 26:26.220
Right?

26:26.220 --> 26:28.380
Were you a Sugar Cubes fan?

26:28.380 --> 26:29.380
Who?

26:29.380 --> 26:30.380
Like before Bjork broke out.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.940
Is it like ingesting for like?

26:31.940 --> 26:32.940
No, no.

26:32.940 --> 26:36.540
Sugar Cubes, Bjork's old band, when Bjork, it was Bjork and then there was just this

26:36.540 --> 26:38.660
guy who was kind of her hype man.

26:38.660 --> 26:39.660
No.

26:39.660 --> 26:40.660
Okay.

26:40.660 --> 26:44.940
I've heard of Sugar Cubes as what you would dump in a coffee to get at hype.

26:44.940 --> 26:45.940
Right.

26:45.940 --> 26:49.340
Cubes with a K or with a C then?

26:49.340 --> 26:51.540
Sugar Cubes just spelled like with a C, yeah.

26:51.540 --> 26:52.540
Oh, okay.

26:52.540 --> 26:53.540
That was Bjork.

26:53.540 --> 26:54.540
You know who Bjork is?

26:54.540 --> 26:55.540
Yes, yes, yes.

26:55.540 --> 26:56.540
Iceland.

26:56.540 --> 26:57.540
Strange.

26:57.540 --> 26:58.540
Flamingos.

26:58.540 --> 26:59.540
Meat.

26:59.540 --> 27:00.540
Yeah.

27:00.540 --> 27:03.660
She, before she was solo, she was in a band called the Sugar Cubes.

27:03.660 --> 27:05.220
Oh, this was her wham.

27:05.220 --> 27:06.220
Yes.

27:06.220 --> 27:08.220
Got it.

27:08.220 --> 27:10.420
It's like talking to Mork, you're like Mork.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.140
Mork, Mork and Bjork.

27:13.140 --> 27:15.140
Perfect.

27:15.140 --> 27:21.460
Flula, you've got, my boss's family is coming for dinner tonight, you have to learn how

27:21.460 --> 27:22.460
to behave.

27:22.460 --> 27:23.460
Zinks or inks.

27:23.460 --> 27:34.860
What is it, you do a show here at the Hayworth Dynasty typewriter show.

27:34.860 --> 27:37.460
Nice branding shout out in case people did not know.

27:37.460 --> 27:42.100
Yeah, you can, if you walked here and bought your tickets, you could do it again for Flula,

27:42.100 --> 27:43.740
but you probably already knew he was here, right?

27:43.740 --> 27:44.740
Oh, didn't he did?

27:44.740 --> 27:45.740
What's that?

27:45.740 --> 27:46.740
You did?

27:46.740 --> 27:47.740
No, I'm saying to them.

27:47.740 --> 27:48.740
Oh yeah.

27:48.740 --> 27:49.740
I was just in case they don't know.

27:49.740 --> 27:50.740
Okay.

27:50.740 --> 27:51.740
And what's that show like?

27:51.740 --> 27:52.740
Up and Up.

27:52.740 --> 27:55.700
I just, I'm like a man that sits where you are sitting and I have a looping pedal and

27:55.700 --> 27:59.180
I just make some tasty tunes and say words on occasion.

27:59.180 --> 28:00.740
How does a looping pedal work?

28:00.740 --> 28:01.740
Nobody knows.

28:01.740 --> 28:06.580
I don't have a dumb question, but like, it's like, so like you could go like biscuits,

28:06.580 --> 28:10.700
biscuits and then you hit the pedal and the pedal makes it just keep going, biscuits, biscuits,

28:10.700 --> 28:11.700
biscuits, biscuits.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.700
And the pedal makes it peak on the pedal.

28:12.700 --> 28:13.700
So you forgot to hit the pedal first.

28:13.700 --> 28:14.700
Okay.

28:14.700 --> 28:19.260
So you would go, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits,

28:19.260 --> 28:21.180
gravy, biscuits, gravy, biscuits.

28:21.180 --> 28:22.180
Oh, okay.

28:22.180 --> 28:23.180
Yeah.

28:23.180 --> 28:24.180
Tasty.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.180
Nasty chef.

28:25.180 --> 28:26.180
Yeah.

28:26.180 --> 28:27.180
Yeah.

28:27.180 --> 28:28.180
So deep.

28:28.180 --> 28:29.180
Change of socks.

28:29.180 --> 28:30.180
Maybe chicken pox.

28:30.180 --> 28:32.740
Steve Levy and the vodka solo.

28:32.740 --> 28:35.580
Is that what summons the vodka?

28:35.580 --> 28:38.100
We accidentally, biscuits, biscuits, biscuits.

28:38.100 --> 28:40.380
What summons the tacos?

28:40.380 --> 28:41.380
Okay.

28:41.380 --> 28:45.220
I thought we had a good jam going there with the biscuits.

28:45.220 --> 28:46.940
That was nice.

28:46.940 --> 28:48.900
You're working with Conan.

28:48.900 --> 28:50.660
The show is produced by him.

28:50.660 --> 28:52.540
I'm long-summed to see you.

28:52.540 --> 28:53.540
Yeah, he's disgusted.

28:53.540 --> 28:57.260
No, I, it's, it disgusted with myself because I'm like, I don't, I don't know enough about

28:57.260 --> 28:58.260
you.

28:58.260 --> 29:01.380
You're a delightful person and I'm like, I'm a fucking, like I, I'm a bad host and

29:01.380 --> 29:02.380
a bad person.

29:02.380 --> 29:03.620
So that's the look on my face.

29:03.620 --> 29:04.620
Oh, love it.

29:04.620 --> 29:05.620
Squinting.

29:05.620 --> 29:06.620
I'm very familiar.

29:06.620 --> 29:07.620
As a German, we have all of these feelings every day.

29:07.620 --> 29:08.620
Okay.

29:08.620 --> 29:13.220
Yeah, the German language would just stack a bunch of words.

29:13.220 --> 29:16.700
There would be a, that's what's attracted me about German.

29:16.700 --> 29:19.740
The fact that you could stack a bunch of words together and make a new word.

29:19.740 --> 29:20.740
Isn't there a German word?

29:20.740 --> 29:21.740
Scheisse.

29:21.740 --> 29:22.740
Yeah, yeah.

29:22.740 --> 29:23.740
Yeah.

29:23.740 --> 29:24.740
We are 12 cop pile up.

29:24.740 --> 29:25.740
It's probably called Word and Stacking.

29:25.740 --> 29:26.740
That's how it works.

29:26.740 --> 29:27.740
Yeah.

29:27.740 --> 29:28.740
Actually how did you?

29:28.740 --> 29:29.740
Verdenstachen.

29:29.740 --> 29:30.740
Verdenstachen.

29:30.740 --> 29:31.740
You say it like this.

29:31.740 --> 29:32.740
It's true.

29:32.740 --> 29:33.740
Yeah.

29:33.740 --> 29:38.860
I love, my favorite is full common height.

29:38.860 --> 29:39.860
Full common height?

29:39.860 --> 29:40.860
Yeah.

29:40.860 --> 29:41.860
What does it mean?

29:41.860 --> 29:42.860
Perfection.

29:42.860 --> 29:43.860
Okay.

29:43.860 --> 29:44.860
Right?

29:44.860 --> 29:45.860
Am I right?

29:45.860 --> 29:46.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:46.860 --> 29:47.860
My favorite is Scheißfreundlich at the moment.

29:47.860 --> 29:48.860
Shit isn't there for sure.

29:48.860 --> 29:49.860
Yes, it is.

29:49.860 --> 29:50.860
Okay.

29:50.860 --> 29:51.860
Ding, ding.

29:51.860 --> 29:52.860
Walk us through slowly.

29:52.860 --> 29:53.860
Say it word by word.

29:53.860 --> 29:54.860
Scheißfreundlich.

29:54.860 --> 29:57.820
And so you've gotten the first one, Dudys.

29:57.820 --> 29:58.820
Shit-friendly.

29:58.820 --> 29:59.820
Oh nice.

29:59.820 --> 30:01.580
Scheißfreundlich occurs many times.

30:01.580 --> 30:06.460
I was recently in Atlanta, and so if someone is there like, hey, how would you like some

30:06.460 --> 30:07.460
turkey?

30:07.460 --> 30:08.460
Do you like it?

30:08.460 --> 30:11.900
You know, it's like, but you know, soon when they turn around, they are very miserable

30:11.900 --> 30:13.380
with their life.

30:13.380 --> 30:15.860
So poop-friendly is not a real friendly.

30:15.860 --> 30:16.860
It is a doodle-friendly.

30:16.860 --> 30:17.860
Oh, I was right.

30:17.860 --> 30:18.860
My friendly?

30:18.860 --> 30:19.860
Yeah.

30:19.860 --> 30:20.860
What?

30:20.860 --> 30:21.860
Scheißfreundlich.

30:21.860 --> 30:22.860
Scheißfreundlich.

30:22.860 --> 30:23.860
So someone has like a face that is happy, but deep inside there.

30:23.860 --> 30:24.860
Just they do not like you so much.

30:24.860 --> 30:25.860
Scheißfreundlich.

30:25.860 --> 30:26.860
Does it have to-

30:26.860 --> 30:27.860
Scheißfreundlich?

30:27.860 --> 30:28.860
Scheißfreundlich.

30:28.860 --> 30:33.020
Is it based on you, or could it just be that they're, because you said they're like miserable,

30:33.020 --> 30:34.860
is it about their feelings toward you?

30:34.860 --> 30:38.540
No, it's like in physics, the vector, the direction doesn't matter.

30:38.540 --> 30:40.380
It's just all over the place.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.420
It's not a ray, it's just a...

30:43.420 --> 30:47.380
It's the fact that they're comfortable wearing a mask.

30:47.380 --> 30:48.380
Yes.

30:48.380 --> 30:52.380
So you know that Dan Harmon is a very well-known Hozenpizler?

30:52.380 --> 30:53.380
Oh.

30:53.380 --> 30:54.380
You are Hozenpizler?

30:54.380 --> 30:55.380
Yeah.

30:55.380 --> 30:58.380
I think I pee in my pants.

30:58.380 --> 30:59.380
Hozenpizler.

30:59.380 --> 31:00.380
Hozenpizler.

31:00.380 --> 31:01.380
Hozenpizler.

31:01.380 --> 31:02.380
My socks.

31:02.380 --> 31:03.380
My socks.

31:03.380 --> 31:04.380
Yeah, yeah.

31:04.380 --> 31:05.380
Oh yeah, that's very good.

31:05.380 --> 31:06.380
Would you like one more?

31:06.380 --> 31:07.380
Yes, please.

31:07.380 --> 31:08.380
A Treppenwitz.

31:08.380 --> 31:09.380
Treppenwitz.

31:09.380 --> 31:10.380
A Treppe is a stairs.

31:10.380 --> 31:11.380
Or for you guys, this care stays.

31:11.380 --> 31:13.380
Stays, what, you know, the stepy, stepy, stepy, what's this called?

31:13.380 --> 31:14.380
A case of stairs.

31:14.380 --> 31:15.380
A case of stairs.

31:15.380 --> 31:16.380
A staircase.

31:16.380 --> 31:17.380
Thank you, Spencer.

31:17.380 --> 31:18.380
Treppenwitz.

31:18.380 --> 31:19.380
Treppenwitz.

31:19.380 --> 31:20.380
And a witz is a joke.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.380
Okay?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.380
And so it is like if you and I are having some reportees, reportees or whatever, you're

31:23.380 --> 31:24.900
like, oh, say something rude to me.

31:24.900 --> 31:26.140
Oh, fuck you.

31:26.140 --> 31:31.700
And I would be like, and then as I leave, I think of a good response, but I am already

31:31.700 --> 31:32.700
in the staircase.

31:32.700 --> 31:33.700
It is too late.

31:33.700 --> 31:34.700
Right.

31:34.700 --> 31:35.700
That's the...

31:35.700 --> 31:38.860
I think in French it's l'esprit de scallier.

31:38.860 --> 31:39.860
Yep.

31:39.860 --> 31:40.860
Oh, yeah.

31:40.860 --> 31:41.860
The spirit of the staircase.

31:41.860 --> 31:43.500
I guess you guys are next to that.

31:43.500 --> 31:44.500
We did.

31:44.500 --> 31:45.500
Yeah.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.500
Yeah, yeah.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.500
We said we wouldn't and then we did.

31:47.500 --> 31:48.500
Well, they built the arch.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.780
Who did they expect to merge through it?

31:50.780 --> 31:55.220
I think that was born on the Alsace-le-Ran, which is, you know, a disputed region between

31:55.220 --> 31:56.220
French and German.

31:56.220 --> 31:58.220
Well, it was Germany for six years.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.220
It's still grudges.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.220
No grudges.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.220
I love it over there.

32:02.220 --> 32:03.220
I love it over there.

32:03.220 --> 32:04.220
What do you call it in German again?

32:04.220 --> 32:05.220
Treppenwitz.

32:05.220 --> 32:06.220
Treppenwitz.

32:06.220 --> 32:07.220
Treppenwitz, yes.

32:07.220 --> 32:08.740
So because the treppen is the stairs?

32:08.740 --> 32:09.740
Yes.

32:09.740 --> 32:10.740
And the witz is a joke.

32:10.740 --> 32:11.740
It's a response.

32:11.740 --> 32:15.420
I do love the idea that in both phrases, it's like the thing that stayed was the stairs.

32:15.420 --> 32:17.780
The stairs for me.

32:17.780 --> 32:22.980
And I think there's an English equivalent, like it just stairway wit or something we

32:22.980 --> 32:23.980
call it.

32:23.980 --> 32:30.340
It's not a household phrase, but it's people that borrowed it from the French.

32:30.340 --> 32:36.780
But I like the thing that stays is the staircase, because that implies that you were definitely

32:36.780 --> 32:37.900
a guest.

32:37.900 --> 32:40.340
And definitely on the second floor or higher.

32:40.340 --> 32:46.100
And it also, yeah, well, that's what's interesting to me, is like, why is that important?

32:46.100 --> 32:47.740
There must be some reason.

32:47.740 --> 32:51.020
Is it like a Downton Abbey thing, or it's like, well, you were upstairs?

32:51.020 --> 33:00.300
It's like, are you talking to me, like looking in the mirror, like, I'm a hero talking to

33:00.300 --> 33:01.300
nobody right now.

33:01.300 --> 33:03.540
It's the idea that you've got the comebacks.

33:03.540 --> 33:06.900
But why not the l'esprit de sidewalk?

33:06.900 --> 33:08.860
Why not parking lot?

33:08.860 --> 33:09.860
Why not hallway?

33:09.860 --> 33:14.380
And the answer must be very specific, like in our psyche, because it's like to be going

33:14.380 --> 33:21.500
downstairs after you, I think it evokes penthouses, I think it evokes like modern metropolitan.

33:21.500 --> 33:25.700
To live in the ground floor in France would be like lower status, to live a little higher

33:25.700 --> 33:27.300
up would be a little like.

33:27.300 --> 33:33.780
You mean you're in the city and you're like, it's not like wit of the of the pasture.

33:33.780 --> 33:38.180
Yeah, like, like, oh, Farmer Brown like made a comment about my milking.

33:38.180 --> 33:41.580
I came up with something by the scarecrow.

33:41.580 --> 33:42.780
The stakes aren't that high.

33:42.780 --> 33:47.620
It's like the staircase evokes this you're on your way down and out of the building from

33:47.620 --> 33:48.620
a meeting.

33:48.620 --> 33:49.620
Yeah.

33:49.620 --> 33:55.500
Or from you or yeah, or from like a like a lover's nest, you know, like, like you're

33:55.500 --> 33:59.540
you're leaving something important and you on the stairway, like, damn it, I knew the

33:59.540 --> 34:00.540
exact word.

34:00.540 --> 34:05.780
Do you know Hans Stumpf, Hans Stumpf, like, is that a friend of yours?

34:05.780 --> 34:06.780
Hans Stumpf.

34:06.780 --> 34:10.220
What does dump mean steam?

34:10.220 --> 34:11.220
Yeah.

34:11.220 --> 34:12.220
Hans Stumpf.

34:12.220 --> 34:13.820
That's like Thomas Tommy steam.

34:13.820 --> 34:15.580
Is it like an engine?

34:15.580 --> 34:16.580
It's a children's show.

34:16.580 --> 34:17.580
It's a train.

34:17.580 --> 34:18.580
Hey, everybody.

34:18.580 --> 34:19.580
It's time for a Hans Stumpf.

34:19.580 --> 34:20.580
Hans Stumpf.

34:20.580 --> 34:21.580
Hey, kids.

34:21.580 --> 34:22.580
Yeah.

34:22.580 --> 34:23.580
Have you heard of a four stroke engine?

34:23.580 --> 34:24.580
Yeah.

34:24.580 --> 34:28.180
I thought that meant like something like, like, like in English, like Joe Blow, like

34:28.180 --> 34:31.300
a blow heart, someone who just talks.

34:31.300 --> 34:35.820
Oh, like, if you're full of the air, the hot, full of air, like a Hinton book.

34:35.820 --> 34:36.820
Yeah.

34:36.820 --> 34:38.540
Like guys being a real Hans Stumpf up there.

34:38.540 --> 34:39.540
Listen to him.

34:39.540 --> 34:40.540
Oh, you're just Hans Stumpfing all around.

34:40.540 --> 34:41.540
You've not heard of that before?

34:41.540 --> 34:42.540
Did you?

34:42.540 --> 34:43.540
No, I've not heard this.

34:43.540 --> 34:44.540
Okay.

34:44.540 --> 34:48.140
Is it something that you are trying to get into the language?

34:48.140 --> 34:51.420
I can, I can tweet it or something.

34:51.420 --> 34:53.620
I've only seen that because I was called that once.

34:53.620 --> 34:58.020
Oh, oh, did you think of something later?

34:58.020 --> 35:00.420
Did you trip in vits that?

35:00.420 --> 35:08.860
Did you chip in, tip and steal from the trip and what vits, vits, vits, oh, very good.

35:08.860 --> 35:09.860
Yeah.

35:09.860 --> 35:13.860
What is your, well, let's get back to your biopic for those that don't know you at all.

35:13.860 --> 35:15.100
Is it biopic or biopic?

35:15.100 --> 35:16.100
I say biopic.

35:16.100 --> 35:17.100
Does this make sense?

35:17.100 --> 35:18.100
But sometimes people say biopic.

35:18.100 --> 35:19.100
I think it's stupid.

35:19.100 --> 35:20.100
No, no, it's biopic.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.100
Biopic is stupid.

35:21.100 --> 35:22.100
And biopic is stupid.

35:22.100 --> 35:23.100
Yes.

35:23.100 --> 35:24.100
Thank you.

35:24.100 --> 35:25.100
Great.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.100
Thank you.

35:26.100 --> 35:27.100
Yeah.

35:27.100 --> 35:28.420
I guess, I guess biopic means they have, they've only seen the word in, in print.

35:28.420 --> 35:29.420
Oh, like with chesses.

35:29.420 --> 35:30.420
The thing in the automobile.

35:30.420 --> 35:31.420
Yeah.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.420
Chesses.

35:32.420 --> 35:33.420
And then someone.

35:33.420 --> 35:39.180
I, I, I never punish those people because I'm like, you read something.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.180
That's amazing.

35:40.180 --> 35:41.180
And you call bagels bagels.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.180
Yeah, exactly.

35:42.180 --> 35:43.180
Because you saw them in print.

35:43.180 --> 35:44.180
Yeah.

35:44.180 --> 35:46.980
I mean, like, I would rather, yeah, I don't want to, like, it's like, thank you for like

35:46.980 --> 35:47.980
reading stuff.

35:47.980 --> 35:48.980
Yes.

35:48.980 --> 35:49.980
That's nice of you.

35:49.980 --> 35:51.980
It's like a favor you do people now.

35:51.980 --> 35:56.180
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I lost my train of thought.

35:56.180 --> 35:57.180
I purposely derailed you.

35:57.180 --> 35:58.180
Yeah.

35:58.180 --> 35:59.180
Sorry.

35:59.180 --> 36:00.180
You asked about his biopic.

36:00.180 --> 36:01.180
Oh, yeah, yeah.

36:01.180 --> 36:08.980
Well, I just want to get back to your, because this is a, this is a story of a, of a, you,

36:08.980 --> 36:13.980
you're 12, your parents pack up, they go, we're going to, we're going to Avalon.

36:13.980 --> 36:16.340
We're going to this, to the city on a hill.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.540
We're going past that lady Liberty statue.

36:18.540 --> 36:19.740
We're going to the new world.

36:19.740 --> 36:20.940
Are we in Las Vegas?

36:20.940 --> 36:21.940
What is happening?

36:21.940 --> 36:22.940
Yeah.

36:22.940 --> 36:26.780
You got your, your, did your parents drag you to America?

36:26.780 --> 36:28.620
Why did you, why, what happened?

36:28.620 --> 36:33.180
I was very fascinated always as a child with America, all German people just are.

36:33.180 --> 36:35.580
This is how it's part of the DNA, you think?

36:35.580 --> 36:37.740
I think, I think you think who knows.

36:37.740 --> 36:39.580
So they are teachers and have summer breaks.

36:39.580 --> 36:41.420
So in the summer, we would come here sometime.

36:41.420 --> 36:44.540
So this was my first exposure to your, to the disease of America.

36:44.540 --> 36:45.540
Just vacations.

36:45.540 --> 36:46.540
And I got it.

36:46.540 --> 36:47.540
Yeah.

36:47.540 --> 36:50.540
And so then when I was able and legal to come, I attended your country.

36:50.540 --> 36:53.740
Did your parents bring you here just because they knew you were into it?

36:53.740 --> 36:55.140
No, everyone was into it.

36:55.140 --> 36:56.140
Oh, okay.

36:56.140 --> 36:57.140
Yeah, yeah.

36:57.140 --> 36:58.140
It's like snap wraps.

36:58.140 --> 36:59.140
Like everyone kind of likes this.

36:59.140 --> 37:04.180
You're like, mom, dad, I'm, I'm into America and they were like, get out of my brain.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.180
Yeah.

37:05.180 --> 37:06.180
Stop it.

37:06.180 --> 37:07.180
Yeah.

37:07.180 --> 37:08.180
Yeah.

37:08.180 --> 37:14.540
That is a solid Billy Ocean reference and also you're wearing Billy Ocean sweater right

37:14.540 --> 37:15.540
now.

37:15.540 --> 37:18.300
So that makes it Billy lent it to me.

37:18.300 --> 37:22.420
What was the first, when your first trip to America in that context, what was the, what

37:22.420 --> 37:23.420
city did you choose?

37:23.420 --> 37:28.740
Oh, Cornwall on the Hudson in near to New York City, which is outside of West Point.

37:28.740 --> 37:29.740
Yeah.

37:29.740 --> 37:30.740
Yeah.

37:30.740 --> 37:31.740
Why was that chosen?

37:31.740 --> 37:32.740
It sounds, I like that.

37:32.740 --> 37:36.340
That sounds like there was like a dictator that just told me here, we're dropping you

37:36.340 --> 37:37.340
here.

37:37.340 --> 37:38.340
Bitch.

37:38.340 --> 37:40.340
I have a pen pal.

37:40.340 --> 37:41.340
I had a pen pal.

37:41.340 --> 37:42.340
Yeah.

37:42.340 --> 37:43.340
Yeah.

37:43.340 --> 37:44.340
Yeah.

37:44.340 --> 37:45.340
Like an international pen pal.

37:45.340 --> 37:46.340
International.

37:46.340 --> 37:47.340
Yes.

37:47.340 --> 37:48.340
Expensive stamps.

37:48.340 --> 37:49.340
No phone calls.

37:49.340 --> 37:50.340
That's nice.

37:50.340 --> 37:51.340
Yeah.

37:51.340 --> 37:53.620
How long did you correspond with this pen pal as seven years?

37:53.620 --> 37:54.620
Are you kidding me?

37:54.620 --> 38:00.860
No jokes starting from what age were you seven and then so you continued it till you were

38:00.860 --> 38:01.860
puberty.

38:01.860 --> 38:08.100
And then it was like, is it me or is letter writing losing a bluster?

38:08.100 --> 38:13.580
I just want to stare in a mirror and see the erections.

38:13.580 --> 38:14.580
It wasn't on paper.

38:14.580 --> 38:16.020
You were emailing, I'm assuming.

38:16.020 --> 38:17.020
No email.

38:17.020 --> 38:19.220
No, no, no, writing, writing for real, of course.

38:19.220 --> 38:20.220
National stamps and number.

38:20.220 --> 38:21.220
Yes.

38:21.220 --> 38:22.220
It's writing chassis and all these other ones.

38:22.220 --> 38:23.220
Correctly.

38:23.220 --> 38:24.220
That is really cool.

38:24.220 --> 38:25.980
I bet that, I mean, I'm like, like, who's this person?

38:25.980 --> 38:30.380
I mean, you don't have to, their privacy is their business, but like they're an American

38:30.380 --> 38:32.900
person that's corresponded with you for seven years.

38:32.900 --> 38:35.380
Like, I'm sure this had a huge impact.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.380
I don't know.

38:36.380 --> 38:37.380
Am I being naive?

38:37.380 --> 38:39.900
I'm like, boy, that seems like such a great thing for a kid developmentally.

38:39.900 --> 38:40.900
Oh, it's magic.

38:40.900 --> 38:42.060
Oh, mail is magic.

38:42.060 --> 38:45.620
Like when you receive a letter from a person that has been written by hand, you know, it's

38:45.620 --> 38:47.580
like a shashank redemption.

38:47.580 --> 38:50.340
But also just have a relationship for years and years.

38:50.340 --> 38:52.900
Was the entire seven years you'd never met in person?

38:52.900 --> 38:53.900
Yeah, correct.

38:53.900 --> 38:58.500
I mean, that's just like such a, that's like, like doing this a million sit ups, it's social

38:58.500 --> 38:59.500
media wise.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.020
You know, when someone is sitting on you as you do it, and you're trying to hype that

39:02.020 --> 39:03.020
crowd.

39:03.020 --> 39:04.020
It forces you.

39:04.020 --> 39:05.020
Yeah.

39:05.020 --> 39:06.020
How did you first meet?

39:06.020 --> 39:07.020
I'm sorry.

39:07.020 --> 39:08.340
Oh, so I was classes.

39:08.340 --> 39:09.340
We are connected.

39:09.340 --> 39:13.060
So the two teachers would connect the two classes and say, okay, now you're going to

39:13.060 --> 39:14.660
speak to someone from the school.

39:14.660 --> 39:15.660
Wow.

39:15.660 --> 39:16.660
You've kept all the letters?

39:16.660 --> 39:17.660
Yes.

39:17.660 --> 39:18.660
My parents have them now.

39:18.660 --> 39:19.660
Yes.

39:19.660 --> 39:22.460
And when's the last time you talked to this other person?

39:22.460 --> 39:23.460
Many years.

39:23.460 --> 39:24.460
Yeah, yeah.

39:24.460 --> 39:25.460
Thousands of days.

39:25.460 --> 39:28.780
Do you, would you even know how to get in touch with them if you?

39:28.780 --> 39:31.620
Maybe Google, but like I am mysteriously incurious.

39:31.620 --> 39:32.620
Yeah.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.620
Yeah.

39:33.620 --> 39:34.620
Well, yeah.

39:34.620 --> 39:35.620
I mean, I, I, I would be too.

39:35.620 --> 39:36.700
I would be too.

39:36.700 --> 39:37.700
Because it could only.

39:37.700 --> 39:42.100
Where did that relationship kind of fizzle out and die or like, why did that go away?

39:42.100 --> 39:46.820
I think we just, as you said, they turned 14 and different things, you know, new kids

39:46.820 --> 39:52.340
on the block hanging tough, you know, yeah, that, that, uh, that changed me too.

39:52.340 --> 39:53.900
There was, there was tough hanging to do.

39:53.900 --> 39:54.900
Yeah.

39:54.900 --> 39:55.900
So much.

39:55.900 --> 39:57.620
I didn't know that you had to hang that tough.

39:57.620 --> 39:58.620
You do.

39:58.620 --> 39:59.620
Yeah.

39:59.620 --> 40:00.620
Yeah.

40:00.620 --> 40:01.620
You do.

40:01.620 --> 40:02.620
I was, I was hanging much too supply.

40:02.620 --> 40:03.620
Yeah.

40:03.620 --> 40:04.620
But now wait a minute.

40:04.620 --> 40:08.620
So you said that the reason why you guys chose Cornwall on the Hudson, whatever it was,

40:08.620 --> 40:11.180
is because that was the location of the pen pal.

40:11.180 --> 40:12.180
Yes.

40:12.180 --> 40:13.860
So that, did you, did you guys meet face to face?

40:13.860 --> 40:14.860
We did meet here.

40:14.860 --> 40:15.860
So that was it.

40:15.860 --> 40:16.860
Yes.

40:16.860 --> 40:17.860
Was that at the 14?

40:17.860 --> 40:18.860
You guys were 14 and.

40:18.860 --> 40:21.740
We met at the Caldors, which is an old mall outside a new book.

40:21.740 --> 40:22.740
Yeah.

40:22.740 --> 40:25.540
And, and, and so you guys were like, it's you is like, it's you.

40:25.540 --> 40:26.620
And I said, it's me.

40:26.620 --> 40:27.620
And then we liked it.

40:27.620 --> 40:28.620
It was something, a CNC music factory.

40:28.620 --> 40:30.620
Have you guys heard of everybody dance now?

40:30.620 --> 40:31.620
Yeah.

40:31.620 --> 40:33.620
I think I remember something like that.

40:33.620 --> 40:34.620
James.

40:34.620 --> 40:35.620
Take a breath and go for yours.

40:35.620 --> 40:36.620
Oh my command.

40:36.620 --> 40:37.620
Now here's the dance floor.

40:37.620 --> 40:38.620
It's going to make you sweat to your groove.

40:38.620 --> 40:39.620
Is that dope?

40:39.620 --> 40:40.620
That's one of those.

40:40.620 --> 40:41.620
Yeah.

40:41.620 --> 40:42.620
Sweat till you bleed.

40:42.620 --> 40:43.620
Sorry.

40:43.620 --> 40:44.620
Sweat till you bleed.

40:44.620 --> 40:45.620
Thank you.

40:45.620 --> 40:46.620
Sweat.

40:46.620 --> 40:48.620
Going to make you lose control.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.620
This is fun.

40:49.620 --> 40:50.620
So you guys, so you guys met face to face.

40:50.620 --> 40:55.260
You had an orange Julius together and you guys never wrote to each other again after

40:55.260 --> 40:56.260
that.

40:56.260 --> 40:57.260
No, we were done.

40:57.260 --> 40:58.260
We were done.

40:58.260 --> 40:59.260
Oh, look at you.

40:59.260 --> 41:00.260
We were done.

41:00.260 --> 41:01.260
Look at you.

41:01.260 --> 41:02.260
Yeah.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.260
Remember that time you wrote that thing?

41:03.260 --> 41:04.260
Yes.

41:04.260 --> 41:05.260
It's right here.

41:05.260 --> 41:06.260
I'm holding it to page two.

41:06.260 --> 41:10.340
Was it, was it, was it, do you, like, I, I'm sorry, I'm making the whole night about

41:10.340 --> 41:13.380
this, but this is fascinating to me.

41:13.380 --> 41:17.580
Did you guys agree in that face to face meeting?

41:17.580 --> 41:18.580
We're done.

41:18.580 --> 41:19.580
Right?

41:19.580 --> 41:20.580
No.

41:20.580 --> 41:21.580
It just happened because of that.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.740
And you never acknowledged it, but it just happened.

41:23.740 --> 41:26.980
It is like when you are in love with a lady or man or a tree, whatever it's your thing

41:26.980 --> 41:29.540
and you speak for many, many, many months and then it happens.

41:29.540 --> 41:30.540
And then it's like, oh.

41:30.540 --> 41:31.540
Yeah.

41:31.540 --> 41:32.540
I mean, how could it?

41:32.540 --> 41:33.540
Oh, it's so sad.

41:33.540 --> 41:34.540
We cannot talk about this.

41:34.540 --> 41:35.540
That's really sad.

41:35.540 --> 41:36.540
Oh, it's great.

41:36.540 --> 41:37.540
It was wonderful.

41:37.540 --> 41:40.780
It was a nice reason to come to America and enjoy some things and, you know, have an orange

41:40.780 --> 41:41.780
Julius.

41:41.780 --> 41:44.220
We did have a Cinnabon.

41:44.220 --> 41:45.220
Right.

41:45.220 --> 41:46.220
The whole mall smells.

41:46.220 --> 41:47.220
Why is the Cinnabon everywhere?

41:47.220 --> 41:48.500
It does not matter where you are.

41:48.500 --> 41:51.780
It smells of these juicy buns.

41:51.780 --> 41:52.780
I just wonder.

41:52.780 --> 41:58.140
Yeah, my cynical brain wants to know, there was two 14-year-old kids.

41:58.140 --> 41:59.660
Was it mutual?

41:59.660 --> 42:02.380
Was one of them completely disenchanted?

42:02.380 --> 42:03.940
Was there a chain reaction?

42:03.940 --> 42:06.140
What happened?

42:06.140 --> 42:10.140
I know that I wrote to him one time and I think maybe he also did, but we never, it

42:10.140 --> 42:11.140
never, nothing.

42:11.140 --> 42:12.420
Yeah, just tapered off.

42:12.420 --> 42:18.500
It was like, yeah, I hope that that person is not out there somewhere going like, where

42:18.500 --> 42:19.500
is he?

42:19.500 --> 42:20.500
I fucked it up.

42:20.500 --> 42:21.500
I fucked it up.

42:21.500 --> 42:22.500
No.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.140
It was a star-com spaceship.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.140
Have you heard of star-com?

42:26.140 --> 42:27.140
You push a button.

42:27.140 --> 42:28.860
It opens very, very slowly.

42:28.860 --> 42:31.980
The men have metal feet.

42:31.980 --> 42:33.460
Was that what micronauts became?

42:33.460 --> 42:35.100
I don't know micronauts.

42:35.100 --> 42:37.740
Are these like a small part of Russia?

42:37.740 --> 42:38.740
Astronauts?

42:38.740 --> 42:42.580
No, micronauts were these like little tiny plastic guys with a million joints and they

42:42.580 --> 42:43.580
had plastic feet.

42:43.580 --> 42:46.620
You already said metal feet, we know it's like this.

42:46.620 --> 42:49.180
They take it inside the micro-machines with the man's feet.

42:49.180 --> 42:54.540
They cause it, cause it, cause it, well, whatever, we'll figure this out.

42:54.540 --> 42:59.260
Is it easier to be a hype man in German or in English for you?

42:59.260 --> 43:02.620
Even in German, you use English words, we just like to say them.

43:02.620 --> 43:03.860
All of our things are English.

43:03.860 --> 43:08.980
We have lucky strike, the cigarettes, all of the advertisements are always in English.

43:08.980 --> 43:17.380
It's like, son of a bitch, lucky strike, you know?

43:17.380 --> 43:26.060
I mean, you're joking of course, but I think, I think my favorite advertisement of all time

43:26.060 --> 43:29.660
is an early lucky strike and I might be wrong, but I think it's lucky strike.

43:29.660 --> 43:35.860
And it was like in the 40s, so round, so firm, so fully packed.

43:35.860 --> 43:36.860
Penis.

43:36.860 --> 43:40.340
I can't tell if it's an ass or a dick.

43:40.340 --> 43:41.340
What is it?

43:41.340 --> 43:42.340
Yeah.

43:42.340 --> 43:43.340
I want to smoke it.

43:43.340 --> 43:44.340
Whatever it is.

43:44.340 --> 43:45.340
Whatever you want to suck on it.

43:45.340 --> 43:46.340
A match book.

43:46.340 --> 43:49.940
Something you want to light it on fire and put it in your mouth.

43:49.940 --> 43:50.940
Yes.

43:50.940 --> 43:53.220
We don't want to disenchant any demographic.

43:53.220 --> 43:54.980
It's fucking round and fully packed.

43:54.980 --> 43:55.980
Get your mouth on it.

43:55.980 --> 43:56.980
So round.

43:56.980 --> 43:57.980
Immediately.

43:57.980 --> 43:58.980
All right.

43:58.980 --> 44:02.620
You'd be a fool not to put it in your mouth.

44:02.620 --> 44:08.340
So you come with your parents, you meet your pen pal, whatever, like America becomes

44:08.340 --> 44:14.420
this thing and then there's a certain point, so I just want to then understand at what

44:14.420 --> 44:21.300
point, because you said, and you're kind of a dry guy, so I'm not sure which is true

44:21.300 --> 44:22.300
and which is not.

44:22.300 --> 44:27.940
But you came here, entered a hype man contest and then like, but I just want to know, yeah,

44:27.940 --> 44:31.180
what point are you an adult and you go like, all right, that's it, I'm making the move.

44:31.180 --> 44:35.900
I'm going to be here on a tourist visa or a work visa and then you're like, okay, I'm

44:35.900 --> 44:38.020
staying and I've done it.

44:38.020 --> 44:39.020
It's just fascinating to me.

44:39.020 --> 44:42.620
Well, the introduction, like the first taste of cocaine when the man's like, please snort

44:42.620 --> 44:44.020
it for free.

44:44.020 --> 44:46.020
This was my Cornwall.

44:46.020 --> 44:47.100
That was my Cornwall.

44:47.100 --> 44:51.660
And then some years later, I was like, I need to try this, this cocaine for real, you know.

44:51.660 --> 44:53.580
Well, if that's the case, then can I pause you there?

44:53.580 --> 44:57.900
Because I want to know like a 14 year old German boy in whatever year we won't date

44:57.900 --> 44:58.900
you.

44:58.900 --> 45:00.400
But we know you played with G.I.

45:00.400 --> 45:05.300
Joe's and the, which, but if German moves slowly, maybe that was 1997.

45:05.300 --> 45:12.100
Do you remember details of like comparing it to that?

45:12.100 --> 45:14.460
What is it, what is that crack hit of America?

45:14.460 --> 45:19.660
Like what are the, what, what, what hits your lungs that you're like, oh shit, maybe I should

45:19.660 --> 45:20.660
live here.

45:20.660 --> 45:21.660
Oh, it's a television.

45:21.660 --> 45:22.660
Yes.

45:22.660 --> 45:27.900
You guys, you had very dope MTV and then you had very many call numbers, you know, 191,

45:27.900 --> 45:33.380
10, 10, 220 with Toby Keith, like 10, $1 gives you 20 minutes of call time.

45:33.380 --> 45:34.380
Is that right?

45:34.380 --> 45:35.380
Toby?

45:35.380 --> 45:36.380
He's like, yes.

45:36.380 --> 45:38.580
You know, but you didn't call any of those.

45:38.580 --> 45:40.460
Yes, of course.

45:40.460 --> 45:41.460
You called Toby Keith?

45:41.460 --> 45:44.020
Well, he was, he did not answer his room.

45:44.020 --> 45:50.140
I also called 1-800-USA-GIRL and if you call 1-800-USA-GIRL, you can try to be America's

45:50.140 --> 45:51.140
girl.

45:51.140 --> 45:55.140
And so I would call as me, but like with a high voice and try to apply to win the USA

45:55.140 --> 45:56.140
Girl competition.

45:56.140 --> 45:57.140
All right.

45:57.140 --> 45:58.140
I can't.

45:58.140 --> 45:59.140
All right.

45:59.140 --> 46:00.140
I'm not gonna.

46:00.140 --> 46:01.140
1-800-USA-GIRL.

46:01.140 --> 46:02.140
Yeah.

46:02.140 --> 46:03.140
But it's not.

46:03.140 --> 46:04.140
All right.

46:04.140 --> 46:05.140
I'm not going to be sincere anymore.

46:05.140 --> 46:06.140
These are real things.

46:06.140 --> 46:10.580
Wait, but it was like, I believe you a little bit when you're saying like that was a thing,

46:10.580 --> 46:13.300
like the TV had all these commercials on it for these things.

46:13.300 --> 46:15.860
The whole culture is free and everything is cool.

46:15.860 --> 46:16.860
But it wasn't free.

46:16.860 --> 46:17.860
It was $1.95 a minute.

46:17.860 --> 46:18.860
It was a horribly expensive.

46:18.860 --> 46:19.860
I never paid it.

46:19.860 --> 46:20.860
No.

46:20.860 --> 46:21.860
You just, it's like the, I ought to maybe eat a boy.

46:21.860 --> 46:22.860
Do you remember this commercial?

46:22.860 --> 46:23.860
Right.

46:23.860 --> 46:24.860
Yeah.

46:24.860 --> 46:25.860
Yeah.

46:25.860 --> 46:28.620
So you, so, so that I get.

46:28.620 --> 46:34.580
So you're just coming over here from Europe, like the TV and that culture was actually

46:34.580 --> 46:36.900
like overwhelmingly a positive thing.

46:36.900 --> 46:37.900
Yes.

46:37.900 --> 46:39.820
And rule bending and breaking is so fun here to do.

46:39.820 --> 46:44.180
You know, like when, after, before I won the Hypeman contest, I was here before one time

46:44.180 --> 46:50.420
and I watched five films at the Burbank AMC 16, but only paid for one.

46:50.420 --> 46:57.180
I watched a Cinderella man and Mrs. Mr. and Mrs. Smith and then the War of the Worlds.

46:57.180 --> 46:58.180
And then that's a very fantastic.

46:58.180 --> 46:59.180
Because you can just stay in the theater.

46:59.180 --> 47:00.180
Yeah.

47:00.180 --> 47:01.180
Who cares?

47:01.180 --> 47:02.180
In Germany, this will not happen.

47:02.180 --> 47:03.180
Right.

47:03.180 --> 47:08.060
Because the, the soft underbelly of extreme capitalism is like, who's going to watch

47:08.060 --> 47:09.060
five movies?

47:09.060 --> 47:10.060
That's not pretty.

47:10.060 --> 47:14.220
And why would we pay an usher to, sorry, I thought you were referencing churches, Italy,

47:14.220 --> 47:15.700
the strategy of World War Two.

47:15.700 --> 47:16.700
Oh, no, no.

47:16.700 --> 47:17.700
Sorry.

47:17.700 --> 47:18.700
That's what I thought, too.

47:18.700 --> 47:19.700
Soft underbelly.

47:19.700 --> 47:20.700
I didn't mean to trigger you.

47:20.700 --> 47:21.700
Sorry.

47:21.700 --> 47:25.340
I didn't know a soft underbelly's were trigger freaks.

47:25.340 --> 47:28.180
They came up to the land on Palermo and they went to Sicily.

47:28.180 --> 47:29.180
Is there a better?

47:29.180 --> 47:30.180
I'm sorry.

47:30.180 --> 47:31.180
I'm sorry.

47:31.180 --> 47:35.740
Look, it was, I think we can all agree it was a very tragic war for everybody.

47:35.740 --> 47:38.300
Well, it's our fault.

47:38.300 --> 47:39.300
Let's be real.

47:39.300 --> 47:40.300
We are the real ticks.

47:40.300 --> 47:41.300
Yeah, yeah.

47:41.300 --> 47:42.300
We know.

47:42.300 --> 47:46.820
I have a couple of friends that are German and they, people, Americans that I know, like

47:46.820 --> 47:50.420
the kind of the joke is that Germans have a weird sense of humor, but I find that the

47:50.420 --> 47:52.820
German sense of humor is incredibly funny.

47:52.820 --> 47:59.060
And I think a lot of it is the word play, because we are, as English speakers, it's

47:59.060 --> 48:03.020
a Germanic language, like pretty, like largely.

48:03.020 --> 48:06.300
There's also like Latin roots and stuff like that, but we're very German.

48:06.300 --> 48:11.740
But my German friends, if they hear a word, they have eight jokes for it, like which you've

48:11.740 --> 48:17.300
already kind of proven, like it's, I find the German sense of humor really, really delightful.

48:17.300 --> 48:18.300
Wow.

48:18.300 --> 48:19.300
That's very rare to hear.

48:19.300 --> 48:25.180
I have my friend from England, he was like, hey, do you know the difference between British

48:25.180 --> 48:26.180
humor and German humor?

48:26.180 --> 48:27.180
I was like, no, tell me.

48:27.180 --> 48:28.980
He's like, yeah, British humor is funny.

48:28.980 --> 48:29.980
Suck it.

48:29.980 --> 48:38.540
Well, British humor is like, you know, also word play and irony and, but the German humor,

48:38.540 --> 48:45.380
in my experiences, it's really like punny, but in a fun way, like puns can be kind of

48:45.380 --> 48:53.500
awful, but the use of words to turn themselves inside out, I find very good.

48:53.500 --> 48:54.500
I like this as well.

48:54.500 --> 48:56.060
I feel like it is in affliction.

48:56.060 --> 48:57.780
I don't know that it's funny.

48:57.780 --> 48:58.780
Right.

48:58.780 --> 48:59.780
Yeah.

48:59.780 --> 49:00.780
You can't help yourself from it.

49:00.780 --> 49:01.780
I cannot help it.

49:01.780 --> 49:02.780
Yeah.

49:02.780 --> 49:03.780
Yeah.

49:03.780 --> 49:04.780
I love it.

49:04.780 --> 49:05.780
So you come over here, you enter a hype man contest.

49:05.780 --> 49:06.780
I do.

49:06.780 --> 49:07.780
Yes.

49:07.780 --> 49:08.780
This is a real thing.

49:08.780 --> 49:09.780
Yes.

49:09.780 --> 49:10.780
The Siam.

49:10.780 --> 49:11.780
I will send you the link.

49:11.780 --> 49:14.180
It's a Siam hype man contest in Chicago, Illinois.

49:14.180 --> 49:16.260
And they're like, and I love the spirit of this contest.

49:16.260 --> 49:20.060
They're like, we want, we're looking for somebody who's pure hype man.

49:20.060 --> 49:21.060
Yes.

49:21.060 --> 49:28.060
And then I can see why, like you're, yeah, like you, you take the cake.

49:28.060 --> 49:31.420
And so I wonder what, what did your parents do by the way?

49:31.420 --> 49:33.060
Oh, no, taking the cake is good.

49:33.060 --> 49:35.540
No, no, no, you grab it in the strudel.

49:35.540 --> 49:36.540
Okay.

49:36.540 --> 49:38.540
Thank you.

49:38.540 --> 49:42.380
I did not know if it takes the cake was a euphemism for invading Poland or something

49:42.380 --> 49:43.380
like that.

49:43.380 --> 49:44.380
Again, just.

49:44.380 --> 49:50.060
You're not Borat, you know, you know that taking the cake is good.

49:50.060 --> 49:51.060
Yes.

49:51.060 --> 49:52.060
Cake is nice.

49:52.060 --> 49:53.060
I like cake.

49:53.060 --> 49:54.060
Let's take it.

49:54.060 --> 49:55.060
Yes.

49:55.060 --> 50:02.700
But there was a point where you, I'm just curious, like, what did your, what did your

50:02.700 --> 50:03.860
family do?

50:03.860 --> 50:08.540
Like what, there was a point where it seems like, because fast forward to the end of it,

50:08.540 --> 50:11.060
you're, you're, you're a guest on the show.

50:11.060 --> 50:12.300
You're working with Conan.

50:12.300 --> 50:13.380
You're all over the place.

50:13.380 --> 50:15.060
Your face is on postage stamps.

50:15.060 --> 50:18.620
You're, you're, you're, you're a successful luminary.

50:18.620 --> 50:19.620
You're an icon.

50:19.620 --> 50:23.020
You're, you're a celebrated person.

50:23.020 --> 50:29.380
And in like, I, I, I'm fascinated by this, this fact that there had to be a moment where

50:29.380 --> 50:35.180
there was like this boat that like you, you're like, I'm going to just do this for real.

50:35.180 --> 50:40.580
Like I'm not going to just have a fantasy about being like crazy and fun and like I,

50:40.580 --> 50:47.300
I'm actually like, I'm going to suck on this nipple and it's not a nipple, just, that's

50:47.300 --> 50:48.300
it.

50:48.300 --> 50:54.260
Well, in Germany, those are nipples, I don't say, well, it's could be regional.

50:54.260 --> 50:55.260
Welcome to America.

50:55.260 --> 50:56.260
It's a Boise nipple or something.

50:56.260 --> 50:57.260
I don't know.

50:57.260 --> 50:58.260
We call it.

50:58.260 --> 50:59.260
Yeah.

50:59.260 --> 51:00.260
We're a very homophobic culture here.

51:00.260 --> 51:02.860
So we, we call when we have to grip something and just put the whole thing in our mouth,

51:02.860 --> 51:05.020
we just call it a giant cylindrical nipple.

51:05.020 --> 51:06.020
Got it.

51:06.020 --> 51:07.020
Okay.

51:07.020 --> 51:08.020
It keeps us straight.

51:08.020 --> 51:13.500
Oh, you just want to chug on that fame.

51:13.500 --> 51:14.500
And then you tickle the under.

51:14.500 --> 51:22.580
Your boomerang's out everybody, but I don't know, I swear this is the last, this is the

51:22.580 --> 51:26.860
last biopic question I asked and then we can get into the present and have fun or whatever.

51:26.860 --> 51:33.340
But like, I just want to be at that moment of, of actual like, because you're, are you

51:33.340 --> 51:34.340
American now?

51:34.340 --> 51:35.340
Are you a dual citizen?

51:35.340 --> 51:36.340
Do you have citizenship?

51:36.340 --> 51:39.900
No, not American, but maybe this will occur.

51:39.900 --> 51:42.700
I don't, it doesn't matter so much.

51:42.700 --> 51:43.700
Not anymore.

51:43.700 --> 51:44.700
Well, now it's weird.

51:44.700 --> 51:45.700
Yeah.

51:45.700 --> 51:46.700
Yeah.

51:46.700 --> 51:50.580
I mean, the last president was born in Kenya and the current one can't read.

51:50.580 --> 51:52.100
Oh yes.

51:52.100 --> 51:55.120
Both facts.

51:55.120 --> 52:01.020
Anyway, but, but, but, but, but yeah.

52:01.020 --> 52:04.660
So this is, I know you, I'm telling you truths for reals.

52:04.660 --> 52:07.540
I entered this hype, hype man contest for real.

52:07.540 --> 52:08.700
I did not know I would win.

52:08.700 --> 52:12.860
I thought I would be like the William Hang of the of the hype man contest.

52:12.860 --> 52:16.940
I just wanted like one minute of, oh, look at the idiot and then I can show this to my

52:16.940 --> 52:17.940
parents.

52:17.940 --> 52:18.940
Right.

52:18.940 --> 52:21.100
So because I did not know what I was doing, I won this.

52:21.100 --> 52:24.340
It's always nice to be confusing if, if part of hype, probably.

52:24.340 --> 52:25.340
Yes.

52:25.340 --> 52:26.340
Like why?

52:26.340 --> 52:27.340
Like they would play a different beat.

52:27.340 --> 52:28.660
They're like, what beat would you like to hype to?

52:28.660 --> 52:29.660
I was like, I don't know.

52:29.660 --> 52:30.660
Beat two.

52:30.660 --> 52:31.660
And then they beat two.

52:31.660 --> 52:32.660
I don't know.

52:32.660 --> 52:36.780
But then they're like, then they're like, we're going to play beat three.

52:36.780 --> 52:41.660
And this other hype man would be like short circuited, you know, like that shitty Johnny

52:41.660 --> 52:46.260
five robot, but for me, did you have an emcee that you would hype that there was there like

52:46.260 --> 52:47.260
a dedicated emcee?

52:47.260 --> 52:48.580
There were three judges.

52:48.580 --> 52:52.700
One of the guys was Ant Marshal from the Lyrisis Lounge and then DJ clock Kent who worked

52:52.700 --> 52:55.900
with JC and then, oh, shit, a third one.

52:55.900 --> 53:00.340
Anyway, it's so say you're hyping somebody that's actually doing like rap.

53:00.340 --> 53:01.340
There's it.

53:01.340 --> 53:04.980
No, there's no what the rapper never appears.

53:04.980 --> 53:05.980
That's the ultimate.

53:05.980 --> 53:06.980
Okay.

53:06.980 --> 53:07.980
Yes.

53:07.980 --> 53:11.900
I don't think you're ready.

53:11.900 --> 53:12.900
Yeah.

53:12.900 --> 53:14.660
And it's just a turtle.

53:14.660 --> 53:15.660
You're hyping nobody.

53:15.660 --> 53:19.780
I still can't hear you.

53:19.780 --> 53:22.820
Are you ready for Dr. Xavier?

53:22.820 --> 53:25.500
Why aren't your hands already together?

53:25.500 --> 53:26.500
Yes.

53:26.500 --> 53:27.500
Yes.

53:27.500 --> 53:28.500
That's fucking.

53:28.500 --> 53:29.500
Wow.

53:29.500 --> 53:30.500
When I say hip, you say nothing.

53:30.500 --> 53:31.500
No one is there.

53:31.500 --> 53:32.500
Yes.

53:32.500 --> 53:38.780
So is it like a two minute, two minutes, or do you, do they tell you when you're done?

53:38.780 --> 53:42.700
I just keep going and going like we would still be doing your sleepy song now if you

53:42.700 --> 53:44.700
guys had continued it because I don't know.

53:44.700 --> 53:50.180
And do they eventually put a hook around you or show time, they go like it's over, you're

53:50.180 --> 53:51.180
done.

53:51.180 --> 53:52.180
Your entry is.

53:52.180 --> 53:53.180
Why some word?

53:53.180 --> 53:54.180
Why some word?

53:54.180 --> 53:56.300
How does it end when you're hype manning in your, as your entry in the contest?

53:56.300 --> 53:58.300
It's the first time the sound broke.

53:58.300 --> 54:02.020
So then I kept freestyle rapping and they were very confused that this continued.

54:02.020 --> 54:03.900
I didn't know I should stop.

54:03.900 --> 54:05.780
And so they enjoyed this anyway.

54:05.780 --> 54:06.780
So I want this thing.

54:06.780 --> 54:10.540
And then I was like, oh, this is a, this should mean I should stay here and do more things.

54:10.540 --> 54:14.860
And so then I just, it is like in the Vegas or Reno, wherever you go with circus, circus

54:14.860 --> 54:15.860
is located.

54:15.860 --> 54:18.420
And you just, you keep making a double down of things.

54:18.420 --> 54:19.420
Yeah.

54:19.420 --> 54:20.420
So that's what I just keep doing.

54:20.420 --> 54:21.420
And you made a good call.

54:21.420 --> 54:22.420
You're happy now, right?

54:22.420 --> 54:23.420
You're an adult and you're.

54:23.420 --> 54:24.420
I'm adult.

54:24.420 --> 54:30.380
You're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're not lifting things for a living.

54:30.380 --> 54:31.380
Just waits.

54:31.380 --> 54:32.380
Yeah.

54:32.380 --> 54:33.380
Do you, do you work out?

54:33.380 --> 54:36.260
I have to look at it.

54:36.260 --> 54:37.260
I have to do it.

54:37.260 --> 54:38.260
It's a job.

54:38.260 --> 54:39.260
Yeah.

54:39.260 --> 54:44.300
I was instructed to use what explain that I received a project and they like you are

54:44.300 --> 54:46.700
to, you are too skinny today, b-boy.

54:46.700 --> 54:49.060
Oh, oh, are you, you're in Suicide Squad.

54:49.060 --> 54:50.060
I cannot say that.

54:50.060 --> 54:51.060
No.

54:51.060 --> 54:54.500
You're not allowed to say you're in Suicide Squad.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.500
That's false.

54:55.500 --> 54:56.500
That's a false.

54:56.500 --> 54:57.500
It's not real.

54:57.500 --> 54:58.500
Well, I think James good.

54:58.500 --> 54:59.500
We did something.

54:59.500 --> 55:00.500
Well, I'm going to disagree with this.

55:00.500 --> 55:05.860
People are very excited about that.

55:05.860 --> 55:06.860
It's okay.

55:06.860 --> 55:07.860
All right.

55:07.860 --> 55:12.060
So you know our friend, Steve Agee, you didn't probably.

55:12.060 --> 55:13.060
Oh, he is tall.

55:13.060 --> 55:14.060
Yes, he is.

55:14.060 --> 55:15.060
Yes.

55:15.060 --> 55:16.060
He's about your height.

55:16.060 --> 55:17.060
Oh, more.

55:17.060 --> 55:18.060
More.

55:18.060 --> 55:19.060
Oh, six, six player.

55:19.060 --> 55:20.060
Did you call me player?

55:20.060 --> 55:21.060
Yes.

55:21.060 --> 55:22.060
It was an a.

55:22.060 --> 55:23.060
It's a and chef.

55:23.060 --> 55:24.060
Yeah.

55:24.060 --> 55:25.060
Don't do a hard hour.

55:25.060 --> 55:26.060
I'm player.

55:26.060 --> 55:27.060
This is in deer of term.

55:27.060 --> 55:30.300
A term of, you know, it's a well, it's what the Germans would call an endearment

55:30.300 --> 55:31.300
term.

55:31.300 --> 55:32.300
Yeah.

55:32.300 --> 55:33.300
Yeah.

55:33.300 --> 55:34.300
You said it.

55:34.300 --> 55:35.300
Yeah.

55:35.300 --> 55:36.300
All right.

55:36.300 --> 55:37.300
Well, okay.

55:37.300 --> 55:41.540
So let's, uh, let's, I think we should be a little, a little more freestyling.

55:41.540 --> 55:42.540
Yeah.

55:42.540 --> 55:43.540
Yeah.

55:43.540 --> 55:44.540
Let's, that's what I'm saying.

55:44.540 --> 55:48.740
I wanted to do your biopic, your journey to, to today.

55:48.740 --> 55:49.740
Thank you.

55:49.740 --> 55:50.740
I did not Uber.

55:50.740 --> 55:53.740
Oh, we'll say more.

55:53.740 --> 55:54.740
No.

55:54.740 --> 55:55.740
Okay.

55:55.740 --> 55:58.820
Could you teach them how to be a hype man?

55:58.820 --> 56:05.260
Cause that's the thing is that I could use some enthusiasm and you could benefit from

56:05.260 --> 56:06.260
like what?

56:06.260 --> 56:07.260
Yeah.

56:07.260 --> 56:08.260
Well, let me hype man.

56:08.260 --> 56:09.260
You know what happened me?

56:09.260 --> 56:10.260
Yeah.

56:10.260 --> 56:11.260
Oh, okay.

56:11.260 --> 56:12.260
So you will hype me.

56:12.260 --> 56:13.260
Yeah.

56:13.260 --> 56:14.260
He hypes you.

56:14.260 --> 56:15.260
Yeah.

56:15.260 --> 56:16.260
I think that's a great idea.

56:16.260 --> 56:17.260
You're the MC.

56:17.260 --> 56:20.380
He's your, your Chuck D to his flavor and let's see what happens.

56:20.380 --> 56:21.380
Okay.

56:21.380 --> 56:22.380
So some tips.

56:22.380 --> 56:25.060
Always ask a yes or no question, but it must be like a yes.

56:25.060 --> 56:26.060
Okay.

56:26.060 --> 56:31.060
So does anybody want cupcakes?

56:31.060 --> 56:32.060
Excellent.

56:32.060 --> 56:33.060
Yes.

56:33.060 --> 56:35.060
Who wants to drink diarrhea?

56:35.060 --> 56:36.060
No.

56:36.060 --> 56:37.060
No.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.060
Don't do that.

56:38.060 --> 56:39.060
Question.

56:39.060 --> 56:40.060
Don't do that.

56:40.060 --> 56:41.060
See cupcakes.

56:41.060 --> 56:42.060
Yes.

56:42.060 --> 56:43.060
Cupcakes.

56:43.060 --> 56:44.060
Diarrhea.

56:44.060 --> 56:45.060
No.

56:45.060 --> 56:46.060
He said the same as telemarketing rules.

56:46.060 --> 56:47.060
Yes.

56:47.060 --> 56:49.060
He's a very, you want to create a yes culture.

56:49.060 --> 56:50.060
Yes or no.

56:50.060 --> 56:51.060
Yes.

56:51.060 --> 56:52.060
Yes.

56:52.060 --> 56:53.060
Yes.

56:53.060 --> 56:54.060
Yes.

56:54.060 --> 56:55.060
Yes.

56:55.060 --> 56:59.760
And what is the goal of the hype man or hype person?

56:59.760 --> 57:07.660
Is it to get the party started and put the MC on like a floating cloud of energy?

57:07.660 --> 57:10.500
Like golf brooks coming from the grand piano.

57:10.500 --> 57:15.060
And then all they have to do is just sing a song and do nothing, but maybe the crowd

57:15.060 --> 57:16.060
is already there.

57:16.060 --> 57:17.060
Yes.

57:17.060 --> 57:23.620
And in the hype man's mind, is there such a thing as a bad MC?

57:23.620 --> 57:27.340
Like there can't be right because you have to stay the hype man.

57:27.340 --> 57:28.340
Yes.

57:28.340 --> 57:29.340
You have to stay in those brains.

57:29.340 --> 57:30.340
You can't go outside and look.

57:30.340 --> 57:32.820
What if you don't believe in your hype, your MC?

57:32.820 --> 57:36.060
What if your MC is something that you don't believe and you're like, do I still have to

57:36.060 --> 57:37.220
hype this person?

57:37.220 --> 57:38.960
Every MC is your crystal light.

57:38.960 --> 57:39.960
You believe in it.

57:39.960 --> 57:41.140
You believe in it.

57:41.140 --> 57:44.980
You believe in crystal light because you believe in me.

57:44.980 --> 57:50.180
Why do you know more references in America than all of these people?

57:50.180 --> 57:51.180
Television commercials.

57:51.180 --> 57:52.180
I told you.

57:52.180 --> 57:53.180
Crystal light.

57:53.180 --> 57:55.540
What's such a thing as a hype man whistleblower?

57:55.540 --> 57:56.540
Are they protected?

57:56.540 --> 57:58.340
If they're like, you know what?

57:58.340 --> 57:59.340
You are terrible.

57:59.340 --> 58:03.460
You are ready for him and he's not ready for you.

58:03.460 --> 58:04.980
And that's a crime.

58:04.980 --> 58:09.980
I need to be protected and I need people to not know my name is Flavor Flav.

58:09.980 --> 58:13.820
This is why I was not a successful hype man in Germany because this would exist immediately.

58:13.820 --> 58:14.820
Right.

58:14.820 --> 58:15.820
I would tell you right away.

58:15.820 --> 58:16.820
You are not adequate.

58:16.820 --> 58:19.660
The decibels are too low away.

58:19.660 --> 58:24.380
But let's say you're backstage, let's just say you've just met your MC.

58:24.380 --> 58:25.380
You're the hype man.

58:25.380 --> 58:26.380
Okay.

58:26.380 --> 58:27.380
Let's say you've been lifelong friends.

58:27.380 --> 58:28.380
We are friends.

58:28.380 --> 58:31.020
And you're like, I don't think you got it tonight.

58:31.020 --> 58:32.020
I say this.

58:32.020 --> 58:37.020
No, no, like in your mind, you're like, I don't think the MC, like how do I get out there?

58:37.020 --> 58:38.220
He said too much to drink.

58:38.220 --> 58:39.220
He's unhypeable.

58:39.220 --> 58:40.220
Yeah.

58:40.220 --> 58:41.220
He's unhypeable.

58:41.220 --> 58:44.020
Probably a dirty word in your profession.

58:44.020 --> 58:45.020
That's fine.

58:45.020 --> 58:50.460
I'm an honest hype person for going out there and hyping up something that you don't believe

58:50.460 --> 58:51.460
in.

58:51.460 --> 58:53.380
Do you know who Kurt Rambus is?

58:53.380 --> 58:54.380
Yes.

58:54.380 --> 58:56.420
The sixth man in the LA Lakers.

58:56.420 --> 58:57.420
Thank you.

58:57.420 --> 58:58.420
Okay.

58:58.420 --> 58:59.420
Wait, that's not true.

58:59.420 --> 59:00.420
That's not true.

59:00.420 --> 59:01.420
Is it true?

59:01.420 --> 59:02.420
Yes.

59:02.420 --> 59:03.420
Shut up.

59:03.420 --> 59:04.420
Kurt Rambus.

59:04.420 --> 59:05.420
Kurt Rambus wear glasses.

59:05.420 --> 59:06.420
He would come in and give 5,000 and go out and get kicked out.

59:06.420 --> 59:07.420
Yes.

59:07.420 --> 59:08.420
And he would punch.

59:08.420 --> 59:09.420
What the fuck?

59:09.420 --> 59:10.420
He would punch.

59:10.420 --> 59:18.780
I have a German hype man and a guy that sleeps in his suit and he said, do you know who Kurt

59:18.780 --> 59:19.780
Schmickenschmack is?

59:19.780 --> 59:22.420
And you're like, the sixth linebacker on the lake.

59:22.420 --> 59:23.420
No.

59:23.420 --> 59:24.420
He was the sixth man off.

59:24.420 --> 59:27.940
He was the first one off the bench and his job was to foul everybody in clothesline and

59:27.940 --> 59:28.940
he saw.

59:28.940 --> 59:29.940
Kevin Bacon.

59:29.940 --> 59:30.940
Kevin Bacon.

59:30.940 --> 59:31.940
Kevin Bacon.

59:31.940 --> 59:32.940
Kevin Bacon.

59:32.940 --> 59:33.940
Kevin Bacon.

59:33.940 --> 59:34.940
Kevin Bacon also.

59:34.940 --> 59:35.940
Six rules.

59:35.940 --> 59:36.940
Six degrees.

59:36.940 --> 59:37.940
Who gives a shit?

59:37.940 --> 59:38.940
Exactly.

59:38.940 --> 59:40.940
Go on.

59:40.940 --> 59:41.940
Why Kurt Rambus?

59:41.940 --> 59:42.940
Why do you feel it?

59:42.940 --> 59:43.940
Yeah.

59:43.940 --> 59:44.940
Your point being.

59:44.940 --> 59:45.940
Sometimes Karim Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy are just tired.

59:45.940 --> 59:46.940
Oh, I don't want to play today.

59:46.940 --> 59:47.940
I don't want to make a nice skyhookie.

59:47.940 --> 59:48.940
Great.

59:48.940 --> 59:49.940
Bring in Kurt.

59:49.940 --> 59:50.940
Kurt will foul in Elbow and make it dunk.

59:50.940 --> 59:51.940
If you fucking win.

59:51.940 --> 59:57.140
But sometimes Karim is ready for some skyhookies and Michael Koopas making swishies and dees.

59:57.140 --> 59:58.140
That is fucking profound.

59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.460
Kurt, sit on the bench, make a little swiggy swig.

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.460
Clap, clap, clap.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.460
Okay.

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.460
That is a fucking beautiful idea.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.540
That goes deep.

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.660
Can you name the starting five of the 85 Lakers?

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:10.660
You named most of them already.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.660
That's not the important thing.

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.780
No, no, no.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:19.420
I just want to find out how much more of an American he is than we are.

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:24.260
Byron Scott, Michael Koopa, James Worthy, Karim Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, and then

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.860
Kurt Rambus on the bench.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:26.860
What the fuck?

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:30.940
Oh, thank you.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.420
Is this just Lakers or are you a big sports guy?

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.420
No, no, no.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.420
You like sports.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:36.420
That is the Showtime Lakers.

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.860
I prefer it, but I know it's offensive.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.700
I prefer the Celtics of this era.

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.220
Okay, now, name of starting five Celtics.

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:47.620
Bill Walden on the bench, Dennis Johnson, Larry Bird, Robert Parrish, Kevin McHale,

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:48.620
Danny Ainge.

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:49.620
Fucking hell.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.500
What the hell?

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.740
I don't understand.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.580
I don't understand anyone liking sports.

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.740
I don't understand an immigrant knowing sports.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:02.460
If you were ever going to like sports, that would have been the only time to like basketball.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:07.100
Stop culture for us is sports, basketball is like the dopest of all the sports because

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.600
of the culture.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.980
Why would Germans be watching American sports?

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.220
It's cool.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.220
It's just cool.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:16.220
Nice dunking, cool swishing.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.740
It's the 1992 Olympics.

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.740
Nice dunking, cool swishing.

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.240
Lucky struck.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.860
That better be the fucking name of this episode.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:29.140
Nice dunking, cool swishing.

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:34.420
George Comptroller, I'm going to decree that that is the title of this episode.

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.740
But it's crazy to recall the lineup of these teams.

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.060
These aren't current teams, right?

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:41.060
No, this is the 84, 85, 86.

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.060
Yes.

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.900
Well, the 1992 dream team like changed my brain.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.820
So like this is when this magic and Larry were old, but they were still on the team.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:49.820
The Charles Barkley.

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:50.820
Charles Barkley, common only.

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:51.820
This is when they were going to the Olympics.

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.820
They were going to basketball in the Olympics.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.820
Yes.

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:54.820
Angola.

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:55.820
What do you know about Angola?

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:58.980
I don't know anything about Angola, but they're in trouble, Charles Barkley.

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:04.820
I can't remember that.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:05.820
In 1982.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:06.820
I'm a fucking paradise right now.

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:07.820
This is great.

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:08.820
Whatever.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:15.340
The fact that this guy knows the starting six or five and then the bench, can you name

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:18.260
anybody else off the bench of the Lakers or the Celtics back then?

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.780
In addition to those guys?

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:20.780
Yeah.

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:21.780
No.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:22.780
But still the fact that you got those is outrageous.

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:23.780
I love it.

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:24.780
Oh, yeah.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:25.780
Who cares?

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:31.100
Well, I mean, it's crazy to me because it speaks of a strange pocket of like, because

01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:36.740
I don't understand like the things that I committed to my memory at that age were so

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:37.740
different and I don't.

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:38.740
Yeah.

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:39.740
I'm just fascinated by like.

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.580
Well, you have different pockets than my pockets, right?

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.580
Right.

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.580
Just a pocket.

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:46.500
If you said I would be almost disgusted, I would take a shower from one of your knowledge

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.500
pockets.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.500
Thank you.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.500
But no, same thing.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.500
Okay.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.500
Knowledge pockets might be the title too.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:57.860
Yeah, Dan, Dan, Dan, name the name the drop and loads guy from porn.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.860
This is one of Dan's pockets.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:00.860
Yeah.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.980
Well, I can't even remember.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:03.980
Okay.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:04.980
No.

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:05.980
I mean, what's his name?

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:06.980
I don't know.

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:07.980
Dropping Nick Manning.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:08.980
Thank you.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:09.980
Nick Manning.

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:10.980
If you're out there.

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:11.980
Are you all right?

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:18.420
He's dropping loads of loads of a note, so there's this porn star who when he's coming,

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.180
he says dropping loads.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.820
He says the words dropping loads.

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:22.820
Yeah.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.540
Does he pronounce the G?

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:25.540
I think.

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:26.540
Yes.

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.540
Hard G.

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.540
Yes.

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:29.540
He says dropping loads.

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.540
Dropping loads.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.540
Dropping loads.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.540
Yes.

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.540
Loads.

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.540
Loads up.

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:35.540
Dropping loads.

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:36.540
Oh, you want a hard G.

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:40.660
And then there's for instance, there's a porn where he plays Batman and he does say dropping

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:41.660
bat loads.

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:47.900
Oh, he adds it like no he hooked into it and he's been on Howard Stern a million times

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:50.260
or something, but he's kind of vanished.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.260
Oh, yeah.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.260
He's out there somewhere.

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:53.260
Dropping loads.

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:54.260
Are you okay?

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:55.260
We could hold.

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.260
Anyway, but that's not important.

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.260
He's picking up loads.

01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.260
Dropping.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.660
All of the dropped ones.

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:00.660
I get it.

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.660
But is it better if he says dropping with an apostrophe or dropping?

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.660
What's less offensive?

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:06.860
I don't think that matters.

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:09.700
Dropping loads.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.020
I think that's cuter.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.020
I agree.

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.020
I think it's cuter.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.020
Less threatening.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.020
Yeah, I'm just dropping.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.020
Yeah.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.020
Just dropping a few loads off.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.020
Yeah.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.020
Here's my YT.

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.020
Here's my Carlos.

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.100
Is it all right if I drop these loads?

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.020
I've got so much to do.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.020
That's hot.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.020
Yeah.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.220
That's his soft core porn work.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.220
Yes.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.220
Like massage videos.

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.220
Should I drop a load?

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.220
No.

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.220
Okay.

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:38.860
I was in a porn that was about a broken washing machine.

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:39.860
You were in a porn?

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:40.860
Yeah.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.860
And it was called unbalanced load.

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:42.860
Oh, come on.

01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.860
All right.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:48.140
Let's do that.

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.340
Let's start this exercise where I'm your hype man because I really think that this would

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.820
be therapeutic for me.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:58.020
And I find that profoundly inspiring what you said even though, and it actually is making

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:03.860
me rethink sports as a utility because you were able to draw from your relationship with

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:10.100
sports where you're like, oh yeah, this guy goes out there and he, for that person to

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:14.340
know, it's not his job to be a star is how I'm interpreting it.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.340
Oh, I love this.

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:18.860
There's a heroism there that you can tap into where you're like, I am the hype man.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.860
Oh, yes.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:25.420
And no matter what this bag of dicks that I'm hyping, it's not a two way thing.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:28.660
Like I'm not here to receive energy from my subject.

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.940
I am here to hype.

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.940
Yes.

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.940
I'm like a jack.

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.940
It lifts a car.

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:37.380
It doesn't ask the car if the car is liftable and if the car says, no, I'm feeling heavier

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.380
than usual.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.620
If the jack doesn't go, fuck this, I quit.

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:41.620
No.

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.860
It's fucking like it's defined by it's jacking.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:49.460
Yeah, it's just jacking off and going and then hyping, hype, hype, hype, hype, hype.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.460
All right.

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.940
So like, I don't have to know anything about you.

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:55.140
No, it does not matter.

01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.140
Yeah.

01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:57.140
But so we do, we do a beat.

01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:58.140
You know, okay.

01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.140
So some questions, some tips.

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.140
Okay.

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:03.420
So as we were saying before, only question, yes, yes, question and you add will not like

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.420
that.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:09.380
So ask, ask, ask the questions and so they will say yes, no matter what.

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.260
And then always something with two parts.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:15.020
So they know the second part, you know, so like hip, hop.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:16.940
When I say hip, okay, okay.

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:17.940
But don't be confusing.

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:23.020
If you like, when I say pants, you say people don't know, right, right, right, right, right.

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.020
Dance.

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.740
We don't, we don't know what's happening, right.

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:30.020
Unless you want to make a little curvy ball, a little Nolan Ryan action, they're very confused

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.020
about what is happening.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.020
A famous athlete.

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.020
I'm sure.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.020
Yeah.

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:35.020
Okay.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.020
Yeah.

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.020
Okay.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.020
All right.

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:39.020
That's another tip.

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:43.140
So only yes questions and no confusing call and response, like no, no mad libs where they

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.420
have to like puzzle it out.

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:45.420
Yeah.

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.420
Yeah.

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:47.420
This was no Sudoku.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:48.420
I have two and a one, three, three space.

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:49.420
Space.

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.420
No.

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:53.500
If the hands are in the air, should they care or not care?

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.500
Yeah.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:58.860
You can even just say, wave your hands in the ear and then you can just watch them if

01:06:58.860 --> 01:06:59.860
you like.

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:00.860
Right.

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:02.260
Is there, is there a way just between us?

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:03.260
Yeah.

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:06.140
Is there a way to wave your hands in the air as if you do care?

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:07.140
Yes.

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.700
I think that's the way to do it.

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:09.700
Yeah.

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.700
Wave your hands.

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:15.140
Obviously, I think wave your hands in the air, like it fucking matters, like it's obviously

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.460
that's been tried and like it didn't work.

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:18.460
Yeah.

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:23.260
I've tried wave your hands like it's important for you and that it doesn't wave your hands

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.260
in the air.

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:26.260
Like this is the last time you'll have hands.

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:27.260
Yeah.

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.620
Obviously, that hasn't worked.

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:30.620
It doesn't rhyme.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:31.620
It doesn't rhyme as much.

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:34.420
It is, it screams of like terror.

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:36.300
It's like after watching human centipede.

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.060
These kinds of screams is what you really get.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.060
Okay.

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:40.340
Is there anything else or should we, should we try?

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:43.140
I would say last thing is ask them to scream at the end.

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:44.140
Ask them to scream?

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.140
Yeah.

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:46.140
Like the end.

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.900
But only ask somebody to.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:49.700
And then don't ask everybody to.

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:56.340
Somebody just ask somebody and then say anybody and then elevate it to everybody scream.

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.840
Oh, okay.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.420
But not like somebody seemed like it's a treat to scream.

01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.420
Yeah.

01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:04.380
And then start permitting more screaming.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.740
I want, I just want one person to scream.

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:08.740
Okay.

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:11.240
So that's your choice.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:17.700
Then you're a great phase one hype man, like enjoy your low throttle hype.

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:21.740
If all I do in my life is make one person scream, but it was worthwhile then.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:22.740
Great.

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:23.740
Enjoy.

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:24.740
Have you seen Joker?

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:25.740
That's I think was his goal.

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:26.740
I haven't seen it yet.

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:27.940
Don't spoil it for me.

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:28.940
I won't.

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:29.940
Okay.

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:33.540
So you, you have the, the, the, the rules now?

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:34.540
Yeah.

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:35.540
Yes.

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.860
And I want you to challenge me.

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:44.620
Don't take pity on me and bail me out by coming in and, and also being hype worthy.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.620
Don't hype man you.

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:46.620
Yeah.

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:47.620
For sure.

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:48.620
Don't bail me out.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:49.620
Like I want to.

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:52.980
And also, whatever you do MC wise, make sure that only comes from the hype that has been

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:54.620
driven by what Dan has created.

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.620
Yeah.

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:59.420
Well, so there should be a thing like all of this has been about like the hype man introduction.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:02.580
And then they, and then the, and then the star kind of begins.

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:06.940
I will tell you, so the star doesn't matter, but what your role as a hype man, what when

01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:12.420
that, when that, when that person is now performing hydration, what's my job hydration?

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.420
Yes.

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.580
Always hydrate metaphorically or no for real.

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.140
I just got a drink.

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.140
Okay.

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:19.140
It's nine eleven.

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.140

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:22.140

All right.

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:24.140
It's nine eleven.

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.140
Let's drop that beat.

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.140
Oh, it's an odd.

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:27.140
Okay.

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:34.140

Fuck all right, he's not ready yet

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.700

But it's okay. You can bring it back

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.460
uh

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.100
Everybody put your hands in the air

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.940
The way you would if it didn't matter if you did it

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.540
Yes, you absolutely don't have to have your hands in the air. Okay

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:30.860
So raise them in a way that you like like feel that feeling of not having to have them up there

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.540
Like there's no outcome that will punish you

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:40.540
Just just feel it flow the ambivalence of your hands

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.100

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:51.420
It's depressing but

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.380
Everybody enjoyed breakfast this morning. No

01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:02.300
That's polarizing. Does everybody acknowledge that breakfast is an important meal?

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:08.060

Does everybody appreciate an antique carpet in their friend's apartment

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:43.820
Yeah, is everybody think bombs filter impurities for cannibal noise?

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:49.180

Does everyone agree that indoors is different from outdoors by virtue of enclosure?

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:35.100
Yes

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:39.980
Does everyone agree that means there's such a thing as being out of the house and in the house?

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:45.420
Yes, you don't have to prefer one to the other say it again. Do you agree on the difference?

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.380
Okay, all right

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:50.380
The next performer is in the house

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.500
It's okay if that's not your preference

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:01.500
This is where they are. All right, that's also where you are

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:07.660

Exhaustion. Oh, yes, and the people may be nice too. They may be rude, but these are your buddies and amigos, so it's okay

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:42.540
And so now all of this is like a very large percentage of foreign players spanish and uh, german argentina ever africa

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.700
Oh, yes, I have to say basketball

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:50.700
Just about takes the cake as far as the intimidating sports like I could never intimidating

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:54.380
Yeah, because I could understand baseball and I could understand like okay

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:58.060
I'm worse at hitting the ball. I'm worse at catching the ball, but if I get good at those things

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:01.100
I can at least understand what's happening. Yes, but in basketball

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:06.780
I they would pass me the ball and then I would start to do something on the whistle would blow and everyone would be like

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:13.500
Are you fucking kidding me? And I'd be like what I don't understand like fundamentals then you got another ball has to bounce

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.900
But it has to bounce a certain amount

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:21.260
I just I never got it baseball is nice because you can have one skill and then you can survive

01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:26.780
You know, there's like a very old very large boys that can toss a ball accurately

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:32.140
But there's nothing they cannot run they cannot hit a stick with a head of a ball and is there any culture for

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.060
American baseball

01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:37.900
I say that like there's it's like soccer like there's a there's a european baseball

01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:41.980
Is that but it baseball is that is there any hope for that in europe? No

01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:46.940
People just look at that like we look at cricket and they go like I don't understand. Why are you doing that?

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:52.460
There's no history. You guys have I've watched Ken Burns baseball documentary, you know, it's like part of your history

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:59.740
Like Lincoln and things we don't have this, you know, there's there's no like Goethe was like, you know trying to steal third

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:06.700
You know now he's writing poems how how insular to England is cricket is cricket viewed the same way by

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:10.140
The rest of Europe. Yes, I think it's England and then the colonies

01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:15.500
But it's like an English thing so they're like if you say so

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:20.940
So yeah, it's it's like we invent these things we invent this set of rules and then we go

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:25.020
This is this is it's different from movie writing or TV show writing where you go like

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:29.900
This is a template for stories that are going to be improvised by people through their athletic prowess

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:36.380
And you're you're actually creating you're kind of building the equivalent of multicamp sets for a sitcom and saying

01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:38.860
Wings is going to be a hit

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:45.500
Like like this is this is these are the rules like these people work for an airline and then they here's the commissary

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:51.100
And they'll have will they won't they's over here and then they're like and you and and things take off or they don't

01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:55.420
But like some people go like I don't understand football. I don't understand soccer

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:59.100
I don't understand like cultures just either take it or they don't yeah

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:03.820
I don't know how much of that is visceral and how much of that is just hegemonical if that's a word

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:07.100
How much of it is just like fucking forced down your throat? You will like soccer

01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:11.820
Because that's what poor people can play in the street. And that's what all of these calling it, you know

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:19.260
Colonial powers like like like brought so the world loves soccer. All right. I'm sorry football football. Yeah, yeah

01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:20.860
but

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:22.860
thank you like

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:29.900
Like that's like the big one that's like the water of sports like because you can play it anywhere anywhere everyone gets it

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:33.820
It's truly based on like just the prowess of people running back and forth

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:37.020
Uh, what are the what's my question?

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.260
That's a good guess for no question. Yes

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:47.180
Why I don't know it's just like it's weird. Why did we invent baseball? You saw the kin birds documentary?

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.660
Why did we I have a friend if I can interrupt for a second

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:54.540
I go ahead a friend of mine who is from is a cricket fan a rugby rugby fan

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:57.900
He's from England. He's from like southern eastern

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:02.140
Southwestern England south northern west east. Yeah, he's like

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:03.100
I

01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:06.460
What the fuck? I mean from Lyme Regis, but I think it's south southwest

01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:12.540
Uh, he watched the kin burns documentary never knew anything about baseball and he watched it and he goes

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.460
I'm a baseball fan now

01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:19.500
He goes like that like that. He goes. I didn't realize the history behind the sport and if you

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:24.460
Sit and watch a cricket match with somebody who really loves cricket and they explain it to you

01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:31.100
You become like kind of like you can become a fan of it just based on the weird minutiae of it all. Yes

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:37.980
Um, I I don't I I don't I don't like the NFL. I stopped liking the NBA the major league baseball

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:42.540
I don't like the way these clubs are ran and the owners are all a bunch of rich white assholes

01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:44.700
but uh

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:47.900
When you said kurt rambas that made me happy because when I was a kid

01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:54.940
That was the greatest basketball of all time was the LA Lakers and the boston saltics and there was a time when

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:59.580
Two rivals would walk up and shake hands before the match

01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:01.580
Yeah, and and then they

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:06.060
Murdered each other. They hated each other. Yes, but before the match there was respect and stuff like that

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:09.020
So that I love the fact that you somebody who's not from here

01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:13.580
Like remembers like the teams from that like that's cool. I'm not a big sporty guy

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:18.460
But I do like when people play with honor and respect and you know dignity and stuff

01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:22.620
Well, they were not making many dollars, you know those even the baseball guys were like born

01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:26.540
Stop they would play for the real team and then they would ride trains and play like tiny games

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:31.820
They're like strippers, you know, they just go here and do some stripping. They go to vegas, but off season tamper

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:37.660
Which guys are you referring to like like which was Larry birds in real like early baseball guys or early baseball?

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:43.580
But also basketball. These dudes are huge dudes. They're playing flying like pan american flights, you know to go play the

01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:45.660
76ers and things

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.660
I heard I'm big into true crime

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:48.460
podcast

01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:49.900
Oh, my throat is

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:52.860
I've never hyped like that. Yeah, um, by the way, then

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:56.860
And for real, that was amazing. Your high manning was fucking stupendous

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:03.260
I lost my voice just listening to you do that. That was fucking

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:07.660
There's a true crime story about a guy whose story is all about what a great basketball player

01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:12.940
He was and how good he could have been and that his life like kind of took these weird turns and he ends up disappearing without a trace

01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:17.340
But uh, what are the chapters of his life was that? Is it Lonzo Ball?

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:24.460
No, no, no, that's a shot fired. Sorry. This is rude. Oh, oh, oh, that's like a basketball guy

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:29.580
The joke could be that he's bad. Yeah, yeah, because I thought I was like, wait, maybe that's the guy's name. I think

01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:31.100
definitely not

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:33.100
But part part of the guy's life was that

01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:38.300
He was invited he he kept failing out of he's like he got into this college and then

01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:45.500
But he couldn't he couldn't hack it and really his uh addiction like it's like like his his path of uh

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:49.020
Successes and failures. It was a roller coaster ride and that at one point

01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:56.060
He was tapped to play in the Harlem Globetrotters, which is like it's like to imagine the the globetrotters are out there

01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:58.060
Are still being like the blue man group

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:03.100
Like like I I'm so curious about what it takes to be a globetrotter

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:08.300
And what their shows are like there are there you think they're still Harlem Globetrotters

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:16.220
Oh, yeah, and they're amazing and and and so you do you buy tickets like do they hold they must hold them at the same arenas as

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:21.580
Regular sporting events, obviously. Yes, usually not the very large arenas, but slightly smaller

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:25.500
But yes, it's also like they're not the pro pros, but the people that don't like when I was a kid

01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:28.940
We would go to the uh the la forum and see them play

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:35.180
And it was like the circus meets sports and it was like they were clowns and and but also

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:39.420
They were ridiculously skilled because like meadowlark lemon and uh

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:43.340
Curly like those guys the shit that they could do

01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:49.340
Was like a like a magic trick. So they would just come out you it was like it was like a that was like pro wrestling

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:52.300
But it was like and they played the washington generals who always lost

01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:55.580
I think not always the generals like one like a couple a few a few

01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:00.060
But they would also like come out with a bucket of water and then throw it, but it was confetti

01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:04.060
Yeah, every time you know all about the globetrotters. I watched they came to Germany

01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:07.100
They and and like was it uh

01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:09.980
Was it the original guys or was it like

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:14.620
It couldn't have been the it was not like so there was like the and one mixtape tour

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:15.580
This is very boring

01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:20.860
But there was a time in the 2000s where like the professor and al and all of these guys were like

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:27.500
Became you knew each of those guys the globetrotters to me were never my era of that was not like this is a famous man

01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:31.500
Who was good at the thingy thing now they're just I don't know if they're just guys that

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:34.940
You know had a knee injury and can't really play in the NBA anymore

01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:39.500
But what they have is like incredible like juggling skills and clown skills

01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:45.500
Have you seen this youtube dude perfect? It's like five dudes that do like crazy tricks

01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:49.740
No, okay. Well, anyway, go all of the globetrotters are like this before this

01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:54.380
Have you seen the youtube video? Wait, did you I was just gonna for context the dude perfect

01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:59.180
There's a fly like I threw a ball and it landed like on someone's nose who's across the stage

01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:02.940
And then it's like oh, I was just gonna say there's a like a

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:06.860
Korean woman or something. There's some video of like a

01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:12.780
There's some there's some woman that does that like like she is a she does. I don't see gender

01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:18.700
It could be a woman. Yeah, Dan doesn't see gender either or race. Well, that's why she could be Japanese and I might be racist

01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:20.940
But it's a because I don't see anything

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.620
um

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:27.100
Like but there's it's a whole youtube video of like her just doing that shit

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:30.540
It's like it's like the it's like the globetrotter version of parkour

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:36.620
Like it's it's her like walking by a laundromat and then someone's like you forgot your jacket

01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:42.380
And then she throws a can of pepsi and the pepsi like hits a skateboarder and the jacket like hangs on a hook

01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:44.460
I I do a bad job of improvising that

01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:49.020
It's all that that's like what dude perfect does. Yeah, she's like walking up a staircase

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:54.620
It throws a thing over a shoulder and it like it like makes a guy that was about to eat poison not eat poison

01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:56.620
It's all while shitty rocks like

01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:00.220
It's like a porn but tricks

01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:08.380
I wonder if she I would it's like like because it's like she'll do I think like she'll she sidekicks a uh soda

01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:12.620
Uh cap off of the bottle. Oh the bottle cap challenge

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:20.140
Um, I wonder who's ripping off who or if they both are like students of some gene aughtry that

01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:27.020
That did it kind of shitty like hey, and he kind of like went like this and three times out of 10 throw me an ice cube

01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:30.300
Throw me a single ice cube. Is it going to be dude perfect?

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.500
Let's say yes. Let's say yes

01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:46.460
That would have been a dude perfect. Wait, did you really want an ice cube or did you want me to do perfect by the leg?

01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:49.980
Okay, as long as it's not inside the piano

What did you why did you not know you want to you want to you want to throw the dirty okay win-win. Oh, he's duding perfect

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:06.780
Close my eyes. Why is that important?

01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:16.300
It's like william tell there's only one reason you want me to do that. He's gonna just thank you in the nose

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:24.620
Is this every Harmontown more or less yeah just 20 minutes of no they say we are in toss this cube

Wait, who's got it close your eyes got it in the front row. No one's got it in the front row

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:33.020
It's behind the speaker. It's just gonna merge right here by so

01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:38.940
That could be good any other sports

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:43.660
Now imagine if your eyes were closed during that

01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:51.500
Think about how amazing that would what if it went in what if it went in what if it hit me on the head bro

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:58.620
That would have been yeah, yeah, you guys watching succession. No I started everyone's loving it

01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:03.020
The finale just happened. Did you see the finale? I think I might be one episode behind

01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:07.820
I may not have seen the finale me neither. Yeah, it grew on me a lot real fast

01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:14.140
I've just started. I'm behind. Yeah, it grows on you grows on you quick. Do you have a favorite person?

01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:21.340

But I because I like his journey. Yeah, I like that he's become a husk and that the husk

01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:35.980
Actually reveals like a core that because the core was never allowed. Yeah a million reasons father son stuff

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.820
I like I like Kendall was somebody that I

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.460
I was like I I was like

01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:49.580
Fuck this junkie, you know, and then like through that conduit. I like it was like, oh shit like

01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:55.500

01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:59.420
That you just watch one thing. That's why they call it succession. You know addicted. Oh, damn

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:03.980
Anyways, but uh, what else? Uh

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.180
Look, here's the thing. Yeah

01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:14.220
Wait, I had a I had a I had an idea the thing

01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:20.620
Hey, yeah, I had an idea a second ago. Is it really my job to make sure the show is like a show? No, it's Jeff's job

01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:27.020
Shall I ask a side question while you ponder? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, is one of the guys a brother of Macaulay Culkin on the show?

01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:29.260
Yeah, okay. Thank you. Yeah

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:30.300
Yeah, and he's quite good

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:35.420
And I would I would I would I would recommend to people that they not know that when they start watching the show

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:40.300
I agree and that they're reminded of it after they've watched a couple episodes because that will make you go

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:46.620
Holy shit. Wow. What a what a what an impact? Yes. Uh, did that give you enough time?

01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:52.140
I got I got enough time. Yeah. Yeah, because because Cody eventually said to me, you know how that is

01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:55.900
I'm like, I don't care who it is. I'm just enjoying him and she's like

01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:59.420
That's that's a Culkin. I'm like, all right. I'm glad I didn't know that

01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:02.540
I meant to die by you enough

01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:08.140
No, no, no, you did not because I can only do one thing at once. Yeah, I'll cut it quick quick

01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:13.820
Uh, I watched in the plane then I'll I'll solve for you. I watched in the plane ride home from Minneapolis this morning

01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:16.700
Uh, the one of the two fire fest

01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:21.900
Hulu is on the Delta flights. You saw that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that is uh

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:24.220
It's pretty fucked up

01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:28.460
The tribal warfare between the two fire documentaries is really funny to me

01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:34.060
We have friends who worked on one or the other and I'm always losing track

01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:39.820
I think I've seen them both and I think I'm pretty much like, yeah, I don't like we're not in the tank for either fire

01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:43.420
Documentary it seems like fire. I don't think I don't think you need to see two of those

01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:49.420
I just want to find out like oh, it was a bunch of douchebags. So I think that's all you need to know out of that, right?

01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:52.620
It's a that's a yeah, that's a fucked up glimpse at everything

01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:58.940
I did have a I had a weird experience where I was like because there's there's one of them where there's one of the

01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:05.420
Guys who like does the whole monologue about how he uh, he was he was allegedly willing to blow a guy for water

01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:09.100
And that that okay. I did not see that that's not the hulu one

01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:15.420
That sounds like the better one if you see the clip the guy is like he becomes your hero

01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:20.060
Because he's so sincere. He's like no, I like he's unapologetic about it

01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:25.740
He's also not unapologetic in the 4chan way. He's just sort of he is who he is and he's like no

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:29.020
So and then I'm thinking okay. I'm gonna have to blow this guy in order to get water

01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:34.700
And and he just tells the story and you're kind of like oh god. There's something so refreshing about his sincerity

01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:36.780
He would be a great hype man

01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:43.260
But I was I I freak out

01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:46.140
I was saying that same thing

01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:49.420
I was at I was at a party and I was like talking about that

01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:50.620
I was like, oh, did you see that clip?

01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:53.580
But I was telling somebody I was like this guy like he becomes your hero

01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:59.260
And I was just saying the same thing which I thought was like it's not that really that big a position and there was somebody there that was like

01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:03.100
They chiseled away at it. They were like really those

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:08.620
Those fucking people and that culture of this and that and they kind of like by the end of them speaking

01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:11.420
I was like, oh, yeah, I kind of bought into some bullshit

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:18.300
Like I like like this person kind of like problematized my worship of some guy that was willing to suck dick for water on camera

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:25.500
It it it was it was an interesting experience. It made me withdraw more from humanity

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:32.220
Because you you really can't enjoy anything. Yeah, you can't you can't even just like poke your head out of the hole and go like

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:36.620
That charred human skin is glinting in the sunlight

01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:42.700
I'll call that a gem and then someone will go that makes you racist and you're like, you'll be big down here

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:49.420
You can poo poo on anything. It's what I've learned. Yeah, you can you can you can I don't want to call it

01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:51.100
probabilizing because

01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:59.340
Because that politicizes it, but I think it's like bubble bursting like people love to take down people love to they believe to be ironic

01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:04.300
Yeah, you want to walk on to a playground where one thing is happening and you want to be the person that says

01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:12.700
What about the other thing? I can't believe people were upset when they found out blink 182 wasn't going to be there. That seems like

01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:18.780
The greatest news I would have ever heard. I'm like, okay. I fucking would have paid double for that shit

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:24.780
Blink 182 go fuck yourselves. Wow. I really wish I could remember the one thing

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:28.220
I think I had one thing that I really wanted to get to and I can't remember

01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:34.220
Things all the small things not a good song. No, you don't enjoy it. I don't know who like is that a song?

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:38.860
Yes from blink 182. Can you sing it all the small things? That's it. That's the song

01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:42.060
When I say all things you say small

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:49.260
You can't even you can't that you no one has the will to hype man blink 182

01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:51.820
They are their own hype men

01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:58.700

Given us or given just

01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:28.460
He came up with that name for the for Dan because uh, so Dan's a celestial viking. Yes

01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:32.700
Okay, there are many though. He like Dave Kline believes that uh, they're

01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:38.380
That there's a group of uh chosen people who will go into outer space or something like that

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:45.340
That sounds we will send that that's kind of the Harmontown right early motto or credo show started with before it died

01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:55.180
And so it is a a funny kind of like yeah, but he it's it's uh, yeah, like uh, Dave Dave Kline is like, uh

01:37:55.180 --> 01:38:01.820
I I I will say like the crazy thing. It's sorry. Fulula. Yeah, I I start

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:07.660
I started instagraming my workouts because I was like, it's the only way I'm going to keep working out

01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:10.140
like if I just like

01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:15.420
It was like this instagram live feature. It was sort of like this thing that to me suggested like

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:18.140
vanity and like

01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:23.580
Influentialness or whatever. It's something that like I was like the only way I'm going to be able to like

01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:26.380
Get on an elliptical and like do these things

01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:30.780
$17,000 on go pros. Yeah, and then it was like well that came later

01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:33.980
But like and then I was like like, okay, this is a joke. I'm working out

01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:37.180
It's like if Matt Greening started working out on like instagram live

01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:41.340
I was like, I know this is funny and if I have a heart attack and die, it'll be funny like

01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:45.340
And then and then like like it just went it kept going

01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:49.500
I kept doing it and then I ran into Dave Kline at a bar at the drawing room

01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:56.220
And like around New Year's and he was like, hey brother, if you ever want me to come by and I was like, dude

01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:59.260
I'm not working out with you. You're not going to be in my trainer

01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:04.620
If you want to come by and hold my instagram camera, that's the thing you can do and he's like absolutely

01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:07.180
and

01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:12.700
He had this way of like coming in low and I was like, I trust you then you can do it

01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:15.260
Whereas like as I've said like any normal trainer

01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:20.460
I would just be like after a point when they're like, fuck you motherfucker. You can do this. I'd be like you're fired

01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:26.700
But Dave he can't it's like he's just coming over and he expects the best of you and he's like and I'm like, okay

01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:28.860
Hold the camera and then he like held it and then he's like

01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:31.900
How about this? I don't even know how he did it

01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:36.940
How did he it's like he's got me doing fucking yoga and lifting weights. I bought a weight bench

01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:41.820
I have a gym in my home. It's amazing. It's amazing. Anyways, we slid into your DMs

01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:45.580
Are you in the suicide squad or what? Why are you I'm not in the suicide squad?

01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:49.100
You don't have to be james. I tweeted it. I don't know

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:54.380
Dan's in a dance in a different kind of suicide squad

01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:01.900
Not anymore me hunter thompson spalding gray

01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:07.820
It's called alcohol when you when you don't want the job done and there's only one job

01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:13.900
Oh founded by river phoenix. Is that one? Yes. Yeah

01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:20.700
The groan was like too soon like no to get get out in front of it, but uh

01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:24.380
I've known dan for a good long time and when he got his pool

01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:29.580
To know dan is to know that he's not a big you're not a water child. You know a water baby

01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:37.980
Jeff Jeff Jeff hates to imagine dan in the pool. It's like it's a year long obsession

01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:43.740
With dan not being a pool. He's more afraid of me being in a pool than I was of water

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:47.900
But when I first up dan at his new crib with the giant ass pool

01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:52.620
Dan lives at a spanish resort apparently like like granada and uh

01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:57.260
He uh, he had a little nose plugs, but now no nose plugs. Whoa

01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:04.300
And now you're doing kicky flips under underneath some water without the nose plugs. Yeah, and diving in is also that that's a big

01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:09.100
Like no pun intended. That's a big leap. Yeah, I'm real proud of myself

01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:15.500
And I don't want to I know I know I know I know from the previous side of the of the of the fitness class

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:18.700
How alienating and boring and shitty it is for people to be like

01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:24.940
But you know, I'm just like like they make a good point though. It's uh

01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:30.540
It's it's it's fantastic and I'm so glad I did it and and I owe it to like like so

01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:36.540
There's literally like 35 40 people who who will show up on a regular basis and you've always been one of them

01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:42.300
What but I don't know anything about you by intention because I'm like like oh, let's get to know these people

01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:47.660
But I like I like to form relationships with them in the moment and reward them for being there

01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:50.220
But who are you?

01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:52.220
Just a small town

01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:54.540
girl

01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:56.540
living in a lonely

01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:58.540
world

01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:05.020
Living in the central coast. Um, I invite you up there anytime to stay. It's beautiful in the 805

01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:58.380
Wait, is it something you wrote down or something that emily wrote? I have a guitar. It's a song that I I improvised

01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:05.260

Why did you ignore me every time I had a question, daddy?

01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:03.660
Because when I said something, you never said something.

01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:05.540
And it always made me mad.

01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:10.980

When I say death, you say grief.

01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:24.320
Grief.

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:25.300
When you say death.

01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:25.980
Grief, wait.

01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:47.940
Tick.

01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:53.100
Does everyone here know that all of their efforts are in vain?

01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:55.780
Does everyone here know that nothing matters

01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:58.300
and there are no absolute truths?

01:53:58.300 --> 01:53:59.780

01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:20.140
Yes, daddy.

01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:20.640
Yes, daddy.

01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:21.140
Yes, daddy.

01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:21.640
Yes, daddy.

01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:22.140
Yes.

01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:24.820
I wash you with this shit and now you'll be blessed.

01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:26.820
Now come back and arise.

01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:29.820
Feel happy and alive on a nice peloton.

01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:33.260
Every single day with David Kline.

01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:35.740
Daddy got feeling fine.

01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:39.660
He, yes, ended my no-bottling.

01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:47.740
Nihilism has been undercut and metaframed into positivity.

01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:53.220
Death has become life ironically at the hands of a German.

01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:56.660
Sorry again for everything, everything, everything.

01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:58.660
Enjoy your night.

01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:02.420
Walk with a buddy at Chancock Park.

01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:03.260
Be safe.

01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:05.740
Thank you for coming to Highland Jan.

01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:06.740
Good luck.

01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.740
Good luck.

01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:12.740
Drive fast and take chances.

01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:14.220
Flula Borg, everyone.

01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:17.220
Thank you.

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:19.220
Emily 805.

01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:37.220
Thank you.

01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:39.220
Did you get any of that?

01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:49.220
It's a good show.
