{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:06.000\nMinneapolis! Welcome!\n\n00:06.000 --> 00:30.000\nHarmontown is now in session. Please welcome the stage, the person who is going to make this night the best night of your life, Mr. Dan Harmon!\n\n00:30.000 --> 00:40.000\nTwin Town! I'm sure that's what they call it. Twin Town. You know, they call it the Twin City, right?\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:54.000\nBecause there's a higher proportion of identical twins per capita. I think it's the power lines. It affects the genetics of the sperms and the ova.\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:57.000\nBut they're happy. They're happy people that way.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:02.000\nThey look very happy and very good looking!\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:10.000\nHalf of them are very good looking. The other half are fortunate enough to look exactly like those people.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:21.000\nAnd they never know which half is just riding the coattails. And they have frequent arguments about it during what they call the festival hour.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:36.000\nDon't mind my sound effects? Every time you say festival hour, you'll hear a gong.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:52.000\nI appreciate the added layer of sound effects. I'm not giving a note, but I don't know if you're being 28-year-old, you're familiar with the history of the gong and entertainment.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:57.000\nIt has a sort of legacy.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:01.000\nIt's the noise of festivals.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:11.000\nErin McGathy, Comptrolling, everybody. I'm excited about it.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:17.000\nI just noticed that there's a camera on my face. Documentaries.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:27.000\nWe're making a movie here too. You're all in it. You're in little shadowy faces. Did they put a camera on anyone's head in the front row? Sometimes they do that.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:38.000\nI notice it halfway through the show and then I want them to take like five bucks off the ticket for the guy that has to wear a camera on his head.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:43.000\nI've worn that thing. It's like a jockstrap on your head.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:49.000\nIt hurts. I wore it in New York and you told me I looked like a cloud-outless character because I pushed all my skin down.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:58.000\nYeah, she looked like Holly Berry when she was the old Chinese man. Like Chaka from Land of the Lost.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:03.000\nThe crazy thing about wearing that in New York, no one mentioned that. Everyone came up to the merch table and was like,\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:19.000\nhey, I'm going to get a t-shirt and a thing. Everyone's so used to having cameras on them.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:34.000\nTwo cities right next to each other. Even buildings can have sisters and brothers. Got two towns that you can go to either one.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:39.000\nI fucked your mama like a hot dog bun. Put my wiener inside with my mustard on top.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:44.000\nFuck your mama like a broom and a mop. Clean her pussy out. Made broom for more.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:50.000\nFuck your mama on the ceiling and the floor. Fuck your mama.\n\n03:50.000 --> 04:02.000\nThat was good. That was good. God damn it. I'm getting really good at rapping.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:07.000\nYay, festival!\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:14.000\nAlright, it's a new tradition. Yeah, there were like eight things that rhymed in there.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nThat was very good. That was really good.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:20.000\nNone of them were mouth and south.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:23.000\nAnd you really used your floor space.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:28.000\nYeah, I'm getting good at dancing too. I'm getting really good at dancing and rapping.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:37.000\nI started the tour just going like this. But now I kind of put some stopping and starting into it.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:41.000\nI'm going to go somewhere and then I...\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:42.000\nAmazing.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:48.000\nI get out of breath sooner though doing that because it's like a treadmill.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:49.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:59.000\nDance is a great dancer though. Before we were dating, there was a night that we spent last new years with Jeff Davis and he put on a song and asked you to dance to it.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:03.000\nHe said, Surfer Baby? Surfer Girl? Surfer Baby is not a song.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nLittle Surfer Girl.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nLittle Surfer Girl. Dan put on a little dress and danced around the living room very sensuously.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nI'm sorry, Dan.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:14.000\nI mean, it sounds weird on paper.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:22.000\nWhy on your way to a comedy show load up your iPad with gongs and fog horns?\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nYour boyfriend's show.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:27.000\nAh, see, do I got everything in here that I want?\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:31.000\nA rim shot. Fuck that.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:32.000\nWho needs that?\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:38.000\nWas that a baby crying?\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:43.000\nYeah, it's a baby crying because everyone loves the milk of the show.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:47.000\nBaby crying.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:55.000\nThe baby crying reminds everyone that the show is like milk that you need when you're a baby and you can only digest breast milk and that's the idea.\n\n05:55.000 --> 06:02.000\nRight, right. I thought it was a six million year old sound that makes people uncomfortable.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:08.000\nI thought that it was a primal, instinctive, people-upsetter.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:15.000\nBecause it means that one of our species, larva, is exposed to a safer tooth, tiger.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:19.000\nYou know that babies cry like that because human babies, they don't have fur.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:24.000\nOur primate cousins, they're covered with this thick layer of fur, like orangutan babies.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:32.000\nThe babies, they come out and they basically just cling to the mom like her fur.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:40.000\nThey walk around and they just clung there forever. It's like a little baby-bjorn until the baby finally lets go and starts doing its own thing.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:45.000\nA lot of primates have similar things like that. They just cling and wrap around.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nTell me more about it.\n\n06:47.000 --> 07:04.000\nPrimates, monkey super monkeys, pretty funky, got a big old brain up in their monkey head, don't fight, they think it's dead, they make fire.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:09.000\nSorry, I guess that was great, but you gave me a look like that was a misstep.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:17.000\nI don't know if Jeff would have been cute to wrap up at that point. It was headlong.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nYou're right, I give myself this noise.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:31.000\nIt's the noise of someone alone at a party.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nOkay, reset.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:39.000\nAnyways, babies cry because, yeah, they're moms.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:42.000\nFucked up my flow, man.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:48.000\nA human baby just has an instinct, if you walk away from it, it just starts crying.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:54.000\nAs soon as it loses sight of a big person to protect it, it just starts crying, which on one hand is a horrible thing.\n\n07:54.000 --> 08:03.000\nThey draw predators, but human babies require constant protection from the parents, and so the baby has a catastrophic response to the absence of its adult guardians.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:17.000\nAnd the game of peek-a-boo, I always talk about this, is the mom hides her face from the baby, which the baby instinctively is designed to recognize as a catastrophe, that the face is gone.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:26.000\nBut kind of senses, I think I can see the Brechtian narrative here.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:35.000\nI can see that she's still there, but I lost the face, and then the mom opens the face and goes like, peek-a-boo, and the baby goes, wait, she knows?\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:41.000\nShe knows that I wanted to die, and she's fucking around with it.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:51.000\nI feel like it must not be that big a deal. It's like that first time you see Mel Brooks do a Hitler joke.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:57.000\nIt's kind of like, just get a big belly laugh.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:06.000\nOkay, we have to talk about, I don't understand what you brought in your sound effects arsenal and what your intention was.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:10.000\nThere's a doctor named Dr. Sound Effects.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nFirst of all, that's not true.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:21.000\nThere's probably a website called Dr. Sound Effects, but I don't think anyone's ever gotten a PhD in what you're doing right now.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:25.000\nOkay, I'll cool it on the sound effects.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:28.000\nNo, you don't have to do that. I'd like you to refine your targeting.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nI don't? Well...\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nI mean, a slide whistle?\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nSorry, that was a bad one.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nNo, I'll really cool it.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:45.000\nHey, do you have rabbit skinning in there? I was going to tell my duck joke.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:51.000\nShe's a good kid. She's having a good time.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:56.000\nHey, I want to bring Spencer hot sooner than later.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:07.000\nAll right, bring out Spencer.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:14.000\nWhat up?\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:17.000\nSpencer, can you believe it?\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:20.000\nNo.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:27.000\nSpencer has been my buddy on this tour. We've done a merch together and spent a lot of time together.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:32.000\nAnd here I am with a bunch of sound effects making a show happen.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:35.000\nThanks for holding down the merchandise table back there, Spencer.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nYeah, thank you very much, Spencer.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:42.000\nYeah, Minneapolis is a self-lining up city, I guess. You guys were great.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:46.000\nYeah, they seemed like good people. I really sensed that about them.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:54.000\nBy this time in Madison, somebody had already, for the sixth time, just gone like, Pringles!\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:59.000\nAnd I went, Diabetes! You were there because it has a podcast chat.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:02.000\nI was like, don't cheer Diabetes!\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:05.000\nAnd then I have to go because the acoustics were bad.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:09.000\nAnd then I go, what? Don't cheer Diabetes!\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:12.000\nNo one was going to.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nDon't stop the show.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:21.000\nI mean, we welcome people with things to get off their chest, but it's not a hockey game.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:27.000\nAnd if it was, cheering Diabetes isn't competing with anyone.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:32.000\nThere's no match that's going to be lost between that team and anyone.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:36.000\nI love the idea of someone with diabetes just wanting to be represented.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:40.000\nWe're like someone in the audience screaming, arthritis!\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:43.000\nDo something about arthritis!\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:46.000\nCut the tunnel!\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nLoops!\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:54.000\nRestless leg!\n\n11:54.000 --> 12:01.000\nDoes anyone have an ailment that they want Dan to discuss?\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:04.000\nYou're going to have a mouse intro? IBS?\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:10.000\nIBS writes itself. What do you have in the front rows there?\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:14.000\nPlantar fasciitis.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:17.000\nWhat is your name, sir? I'm going to do it, Jeff does. What is your name?\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:18.000\nI'm Tony.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:22.000\nTony, come on up here!\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:27.000\nHere, Tony. Thank you.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.000\nAnything you don't want to talk about, you don't have to talk about it.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nHarbin Town is a safe place.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nI appreciate that.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:39.000\nFirst of all, Tony is wearing a red owl t-shirt.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:43.000\nThat was the local grocery store in Milwaukee when I was a kid.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nIt was the local grocery store in Green Bay when I was a kid.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nDo they still exist?\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:51.000\nOne, and it's in Green Bay, and it's still fighting for its existence.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:55.000\nThe logo, it just stirs up. I haven't seen it in so long.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nWhat kind of stuff do they have at the red?\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:00.000\nOh God, milk, eggs.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nProduce and meat?\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nYou just wouldn't believe it.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nSometimes they put it in bags for you.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nIncredible aisles and aisles of food with fluorescent lids.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:15.000\nIs it not successful because red owl kind of sounds like a hate group?\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nDon't be insulted.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nOh no, no, no.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nNo baby, open that shirt.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.000\nRed owl sounds more like a reverse hate group.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:28.000\nLike a kind of a militant.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nWe are the red owls.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nIt sounds like a very wise socialist organization.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:37.000\nLike in Latin it says never again.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:40.000\nIt refers to something that happened to red people.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:43.000\nNever again will we let a sale pass us by.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nThe red owl.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:50.000\nSomebody spilled some milk in aisle 7 and we never forgot.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:53.000\nAlright, what's plantar fasciitis?\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nI'll give you one guess.\n\n13:55.000 --> 14:00.000\nIt's when every piece of fungus on your foot unites\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:06.000\nin a horrible Naziistic regime.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nWhich the red owls are fighting.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:12.000\nNo, it is foot related, but it is not fungus related.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:16.000\nIt's severe scarring of the large tendon that runs under your foot.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:21.000\nIt makes you limp and it makes you look like you're 20 years older than you actually are.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:25.000\nWait, you mean your gait doesn't actually have the effect on you?\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:26.000\nNo.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nDo you have it?\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.000\nYes, I do.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:32.000\nYou just mean it makes you walk like you're 20 years older.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nYeah, it gives you the hobbling gait of a 60 year old man.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nCan you show us?\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nOh, Tony, you look very young.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nThank you.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:41.000\nDo you want to give us a little runway?\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nI'm going to have him walk.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:46.000\nWell, I should give you some walking music, I guess.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:55.000\nRight now it's in remission, so I used to walk like normal people, which was back and forth.\n\n14:55.000 --> 15:02.000\nAnd then it struck and sometimes you get up and you use your foot and it feels like this.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:06.000\nOh, because the tendon is like not doing what it's supposed to do.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:11.000\nNo, and then so you have to sit down a lot and people ask you, why are you so lazy?\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:15.000\nOh, and you're like, fuck you, I have hysteria.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:21.000\nAnd they go, does that have something to do with fungus?\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.000\nNo.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:26.000\nPlay that song again, you know, it was really moved.\n\n15:52.000 --> 16:00.000\nDon't be beaten today, double rhyme scheme.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:04.000\nThat was A-B-A-B, no one was impressed, alright?\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nI was damn impressed.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nOkay, never mind, fuck it.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:11.000\nNo, you know what, I have worse than a plancher's fascitis.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:19.000\nI have audience unappreciative titis.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:22.000\nI wish I just couldn't walk.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:25.000\nI can't be appreciated.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:32.000\nThat's the disease that infects the lower base of the brain and makes further audience applause completely jaded and meaningless?\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:36.000\nYeah, it definitely undermines anything you get after that.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:40.000\nIt's linked to solicited applause syndrome, yeah.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:47.000\nIf Dan was a revival tent preacher, someone would come up and say, I can't walk,\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:51.000\nand I'd be like, really? Because I had a really difficult morning.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:56.000\nI was really in my head, I thought a lot about my life, and I didn't know if I've done enough so far.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nJust sit down.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:03.000\nWell Tony, I have a very special surprise for you, because here in the audience here in Minneapolis,\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:08.000\nTwin Town as I call it, is a fellow cast away from an old improv troupe.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nI used to be in Milwaukee called The Dead Ale Wives.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:16.000\nOne of my old comedy stage partners, Sean McKenna is here.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:20.000\nWoo!

able to walk normally again.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:05.000\nAt least I'll get to watch the next season for Dr. Who here.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:08.000\nTony, there's something I have to tell you.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:15.000\nWatching Dr. Who is what is eating away at the tendon on your foot.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:21.000\nYou see, British sci-fi programming stimulates a part of the brain\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:25.000\nthat sends a signal to the athletic portions of the body,\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:33.000\ncausing them to wither.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:36.000\nHave you told my mother?\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nYeah, I mentioned it.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nDo you have a mother?\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:44.000\nHave I met her?\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:47.000\nEveryone met my mother?\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nYeah, I'm sure I told her.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nIf I met her, I can't remember.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nJust cut it off.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nOkay.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nI'll never dance again.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:01.000\nI'm going to do it with a lightsaber.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:04.000\nBecause if I did it with a sonic screwdriver,\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:07.000\nyour other foot would start to rot away.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:13.000\nMaybe if you put it in a teleport machine with a good leg,\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nI don't know, it was a fly reference.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nNo one's seen that.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:22.000\nLet's try it.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nOh, I puked on it.\n\n25:24.000 -->

first.\n\n28:25.440 --> 28:28.200\nThey would do who's on first with Abbott and Arnold\n\n28:28.200 --> 28:30.360\nSchwarzenegger.\n\n28:30.360 --> 28:33.520\nIt was a very cutting edge comedic bit\n\n28:33.520 --> 28:37.720\nthat we were doing as early as 94, 95.\n\n28:37.720 --> 28:40.600\nYeah, sure.\n\n28:40.600 --> 28:43.040\nWho's going to be Abbott and who's going to be Arnold?\n\n28:43.040 --> 28:44.960\nI don't know.\n\n28:44.960 --> 28:47.200\nWhich one was Abbott?\n\n28:47.200 --> 28:50.600\nI'd like to see Sean McKenna as Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n28:50.600 --> 28:51.920\nLet's do Arnold and Arnold.\n\n28:51.920 --> 28:54.440\nLike that, we'll do Arnold and Arnold.\n\n28:54.440 --> 28:56.400\nWe're drunk one night and did Arnold and Arnold.\n\n28:56.400 --> 28:57.200\nArnold and Arnold.\n\n28:57.200 --> 28:58.480\nDo I need a mic stand?\n\n28:58.480 --> 28:59.160\nYeah, probably.\n\n28:59.160 --> 29:00.840\nYeah.\n\n29:00.840 --> 29:02.080\nThey really, yeah.\n\n29:02.080 --> 29:04.000\nYeah, you need full focus on this mentally.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.600\nWell, I just need some Alina.\n\n29:06.600 --> 29:18.760\nAnd now presenting the Harmontown players, Arnold and Arnold.\n\n29:18.760 --> 29:20.120\nArnold.\n\n29:20.120 --> 29:22.560\nYeah, listen.\n\n29:22.560 --> 29:26.040\nI got a baseball team.\n\n29:26.040 --> 29:27.280\nIt's very nice.\n\n29:27.280 --> 29:28.960\nAll right.\n\n29:28.960 --> 29:30.920\nDid you learn the name of the players?\n\n29:30.920 --> 29:32.360\nThe players.\n\n29:32.360 --> 29:33.920\nI have the list right here.\n\n29:33.920 --> 29:35.560\nOK, then tell them to me.\n\n29:35.560 --> 29:36.720\nWho's on first?\n\n29:36.720 --> 29:39.160\nOK, I don't understand what you're saying.\n\n29:39.160 --> 29:41.040\nWho's on first?\n\n29:41.040 --> 29:43.280\nWhy would someone that named Who be on first?\n\n29:43.280 --> 29:44.800\nWho is on first?\n\n29:44.800 --> 29:48.960\nOK, well, that's a dumb name.\n\n29:48.960 --> 29:50.560\nI don't know.\n\n29:50.560 --> 29:52.560\nSun second?\n\n29:52.560 --> 29:57.080\nI don't know either.\n\n29:57.080 --> 30:00.080\nI don't know either.\n\n30:00.080 --> 30:01.080\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n30:01.080 --> 30:02.080\nThank you.\n\n30:02.080 --> 30:03.080\nArnold, Arnold.\n\n30:03.080 --> 30:04.080\nThank you.\n\n30:04.080 --> 30:05.080\nLet's hear it for Sean McKenna and Arnold.\n\n30:05.080 --> 30:07.080\nWow.\n\n30:07.080 --> 30:12.720\nFrom humble beginnings, Arnold and Arnold.\n\n30:12.720 --> 30:15.480\nI feel like Eric Noble got the short end of tonight's stick.\n\n30:15.480 --> 30:20.040\nIt kind of came up and, yeah, we didn't really.\n\n30:20.040 --> 30:21.720\nSomeone should really control this show.\n\n30:21.720 --> 30:25.200\nYeah, we didn't really use him.\n\n30:25.200 --> 30:27.320\nHe's very talented, very funny, very handsome.\n\n30:27.320 --> 30:29.320\nVery handsome, too.\n\n30:29.320 --> 30:30.520\nYeah, he's a brother.\n\n30:30.520 --> 30:31.520\nVery handsome.\n\n30:31.520 --> 30:40.760\nSpencer, I'm being attacked by, what's that?\n\n30:40.760 --> 30:41.760\nArnold's monster.\n\n30:41.760 --> 30:45.320\nI'm being attacked by an Arnold monster.\n\n30:45.320 --> 30:46.640\nSomeone yelled out.\n\n30:46.640 --> 30:47.880\nSomeone approaches you.\n\n30:47.880 --> 30:51.760\nHe's about a four foot seven or so.\n\n30:51.760 --> 30:57.040\nHe pushes small children out of his way and says, get through the topper!\n\n30:57.040 --> 30:58.040\nThat's all.\n\n30:58.040 --> 31:02.920\nAll right, you want to hit that Spencer theme when we do that?\n\n31:02.920 --> 31:04.920\nIt's her first night control.\n\n31:04.920 --> 31:07.320\nI'm having iPad troubles.\n\n31:07.320 --> 31:10.920\nYeah, I'm not so good at the references, if you'll recall.\n\n31:10.920 --> 31:12.440\nOh, there it is, okay.\n\n31:12.440 --> 31:15.720\nYeah, no, yeah, we don't like to do the Hollywood stuff to Spencer.\n\n31:15.720 --> 31:16.720\nOh, slowly.\n\n31:16.720 --> 31:17.720\nSorry.\n\n31:17.720 --> 31:18.720\nForced to have it.\n\n31:18.720 --> 31:22.000\nSpencer grew up in a basement that he still lives in, so there's no TV in there.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:28.160\nHe's just Dutch as a dragon's books, and unlike, he's a genius.\n\n31:28.160 --> 31:34.040\nSpencer, I'm being attacked by, shit.\n\n31:34.040 --> 31:36.680\nLack of sound engineering skills.\n\n31:36.680 --> 31:42.640\nWalking into a non-acoustically tuned space, you suddenly realize that the variables aren't\n\n31:42.640 --> 31:45.080\nexactly lining up right.\n\n31:45.080 --> 31:49.200\nYou clap your hands, and hear your hands clapping.\n\n31:49.200 --> 31:59.600\nIt's a strange sensation.\n\n31:59.600 --> 32:01.880\nI'm not worthy.\n\n32:01.880 --> 32:17.720\nSpencer, I'm being attacked by a hot dish.\n\n32:17.720 --> 32:22.880\nIs that a colloquialism?\n\n32:22.880 --> 32:23.880\nIt's a casserole.\n\n32:23.880 --> 32:26.920\nI'm being attacked by a hot casserole dish.\n\n32:26.920 --> 32:31.760\nUnfurling the noodles widely with an array of various meat sauces.\n\n32:31.760 --> 32:36.400\nYou see the ricotta cheese dripping off the noodles.\n\n32:36.400 --> 32:43.600\nDinner is served.\n\n32:43.600 --> 32:51.080\nOne guy initiated a standing O for that, and he wasn't, you know, he's not a fat guy.\n\n32:51.080 --> 32:52.880\nHe wasn't applauding the casserole.\n\n32:52.880 --> 32:56.840\nHe was applauding Spencer's GM skills.\n\n32:56.840 --> 33:02.760\nAll right, so, all right, is there anybody in the audience, I'm going to go out and work\n\n33:02.760 --> 33:03.760\nthe crowd.\n\n33:03.760 --> 33:04.760\nCool.\n\n33:04.760 --> 33:06.760\nYou got some crowd working music?\n\n33:06.760 --> 33:23.640\nIn the meanwhile, I'm going to play Polar Bear on Ice.\n\n33:23.640 --> 33:24.640\nI don't understand.\n\n33:24.640 --> 33:32.360\nI'd like to work the back of the crowd, because these people come and they don't, oh, is this\n\n33:32.360 --> 33:33.960\nwhat I sound like back here?\n\n33:33.960 --> 33:35.960\nThat's weird.\n\n33:35.960 --> 33:41.080\nIt's like those Discovery World exhibits where you talk on the phone and you can hear yourself\n\n33:41.080 --> 33:42.480\nin the ear, but on a delay.\n\n33:42.480 --> 33:47.040\nI can barely pull it together back here.\n\n33:47.040 --> 33:51.160\nMy lips move, and then a second later, I hear my lips move.\n\n33:51.160 --> 33:53.280\nIt probably sounds less exciting on the podcast.\n\n33:53.280 --> 33:56.200\nIt probably sounds less exciting for everybody.\n\n33:56.200 --> 33:58.800\nThis is just for me right now.\n\n33:58.800 --> 34:08.360\nThree hours later, wow, syllabus, red leather, yellow leather.\n\n34:08.360 --> 34:09.360\nWhat's your name?\n\n34:09.360 --> 34:10.360\nSam.\n\n34:10.360 --> 34:14.160\nNo, it's not.\n\n34:14.160 --> 34:16.160\nCrowd working.\n\n34:16.160 --> 34:20.080\nSam, did your parents hit you?\n\n34:20.080 --> 34:22.160\nI don't remember.\n\n34:22.160 --> 34:25.840\nThen yes.\n\n34:25.840 --> 34:28.680\nWith implements, my dad hit me with a belt.\n\n34:28.680 --> 34:30.680\nDid your mother hit you with implants?\n\n34:30.680 --> 34:31.680\nNo.\n\n34:31.680 --> 34:34.280\nHe said your mother hit you with implants?\n\n34:34.280 --> 34:35.280\nNo.\n\n34:35.280 --> 34:37.680\nI said, did they hit you with implements?\n\n34:37.680 --> 34:40.520\nMy dad, for instance, hit me with a belt.\n\n34:40.520 --> 34:45.920\nDid your parents hit you with anything, like a wooden spoon or?\n\n34:45.920 --> 34:51.480\nNo, I think before I had any memories, I was fanked, but like I said, it must have hit\n\n34:51.480 --> 34:52.480\nme pretty hard.\n\n34:52.480 --> 34:53.480\nOh, okay.\n\n34:53.480 --> 34:54.480\nOh, man.\n\n34:54.480 --> 34:55.480\nHey, Dan.\n\n34:55.480 --> 34:56.480\nYeah?\n\n34:56.480 --> 35:03.120\nI have a bunch of animal sound effects up here that are pretty obscure.\n\n35:03.120 --> 35:06.880\nI'm going to play an animal sound effect.\n\n35:06.880 --> 35:10.920\nYou pick a partner out there, and you guys can try to guess what the animal sound effect\n\n35:10.920 --> 35:13.720\nis as an experiment.\n\n35:13.720 --> 35:18.960\nOkay, I like Sam.\n\n35:18.960 --> 35:19.960\nAre we competing?\n\n35:19.960 --> 35:21.960\nAm I competing with Sam?\n\n35:21.960 --> 35:22.960\nNo.\n\n35:22.960 --> 35:28.760\nLet's see, a gentleman with the checkered, yes, yes, you holding your shirt.\n\n35:28.760 --> 35:29.760\nWhat's your name?\n\n35:29.760 --> 35:30.760\nMatt.\n\n35:30.760 --> 35:31.760\nMatt?\n\n35:31.760 --> 35:32.760\nTwo T's.\n\n35:32.760 --> 35:33.760\nMatt?\n\n35:33.760 --> 35:34.760\nMatt.\n\n35:34.760 --> 35:35.760\nOh, it's Matt.\n\n35:35.760 --> 35:36.760\nLike the actual name.\n\n35:36.760 --> 35:37.760\nOkay.\n\n35:37.760 --> 35:38.760\nGot it.\n\n35:38.760 --> 35:40.760\nBecause Matt's isn't a name.\n\n35:40.760 --> 35:41.760\nWould you run up and join Spencer?\n\n35:41.760 --> 35:42.760\nWould you be Spencer's partner?\n\n35:42.760 --> 35:52.760\nWelcome to Guess the Sound Effect slash, I'm so sorry that your dad hit you.\n\n35:52.760 --> 35:54.760\nOkay.\n\n35:54.760 --> 35:55.760\nBut he didn't really.\n\n35:55.760 --> 36:01.760\nI mean, I think they just probably smacked him in the butt when he touched a stove or\n\n36:01.760 --> 36:02.760\nsomething.\n\n36:02.760 --> 36:03.760\nThat's the impression I'm getting.\n\n36:03.760 --> 36:05.760\nI was talking about your dad.\n\n36:05.760 --> 36:06.760\nOh, my dad?\n\n36:06.760 --> 36:07.760\nYeah.\n\n36:07.760 --> 36:08.760\nYeah, he knocked me around bad.\n\n36:08.760 --> 36:09.760\nOkay.\n\n36:09.760 --> 36:15.760\nI was going to say, if your dad didn't hit you, why am I turned on by you all the time?\n\n36:15.760 --> 36:18.760\nAll right, here we go, animal sound effects.\n\n36:18.760 --> 36:27.760\nAnd just to give you an example, this animal sound effect is called a dingo fight.\n\n36:27.760 --> 36:28.760\nDingos.\n\n36:28.760 --> 36:29.760\nFighters.\n\n36:29.760 --> 36:34.760\nWait, where is that?\n\n36:34.760 --> 36:35.760\nUh-oh.\n\n36:35.760 --> 36:38.760\nOh, there it is.\n\n36:38.760 --> 36:39.760\nDingos.\n\n36:39.760 --> 36:42.760\nAnyway, that's dingo fight.\n\n36:42.760 --> 36:43.760\nOkay.\n\n36:43.760 --> 36:44.760\nAll right, okay.\n\n36:44.760 --> 36:45.760\nHere we go.\n\n36:45.760 --> 36:51.760\nSo I'm going to play a sound effect and the team to get closest to it, the quickest,\n\n36:51.760 --> 36:52.760\nQuinn's.\n\n36:52.760 --> 36:54.760\nDon't know why I said it like that.\n\n36:54.760 --> 36:55.760\nIt's fancy.\n\n36:55.760 --> 37:00.760\nI just, I made it like I was a Jewish man at a dolly for no reason.\n\n37:00.760 --> 37:02.760\nAll right, here we go.\n\n37:02.760 --> 37:03.760\nDingos.\n\n37:03.760 --> 37:04.760\nRight.\n\n37:04.760 --> 37:05.760\nName an animal.\n\n37:05.760 --> 37:06.760\nThe teapot bird.\n\n37:06.760 --> 37:07.760\nSorry?\n\n37:07.760 --> 37:08.760\nIt stands for the teapot bird.\n\n37:08.760 --> 37:09.760\nTeapot bird.\n\n37:09.760 --> 37:16.760\nSwarming, um, uh, June bugs.\n\n37:16.760 --> 37:17.760\nThat's pretty close.\n\n37:17.760 --> 37:20.760\nIt was Fly, Swarm, and Roebuck Bay, Australia.\n\n37:20.760 --> 37:21.760\nVery good.\n\n37:21.760 --> 37:24.760\nOne point to audience.\n\n37:24.760 --> 37:29.760\nOkay, let's, let's play the two.\n\n37:29.760 --> 37:31.760\nAll right, here we go.\n\n37:31.760 --> 37:33.760\nQuestion number two.\n\n37:33.760 --> 37:40.760\nWell, that's a horse, a capybara.\n\n37:40.760 --> 37:41.760\nDonkey.\n\n37:41.760 --> 37:54.760\nThat is a brain donkey in Brazil with parents.\n\n37:54.760 --> 37:55.760\nAll right.\n\n37:55.760 --> 37:56.760\nThis is the tiebreaker.\n\n37:56.760 --> 37:57.760\nHere it comes.\n\n37:57.760 --> 38:04.760\nAll right, Jeff, I know you're that you're listening to this podcast.\n\n38:04.760 --> 38:08.760\nWe may edit this part out.\n\n38:08.760 --> 38:13.760\nI, I, I, as a rule, I edit all the stuff out that the audience is able to do in their car\n\n38:13.760 --> 38:20.760\non the way here.\n\n38:20.760 --> 38:21.760\nUm, Jeff, I'll do better.\n\n38:21.760 --> 38:23.760\nIt's going to get better.\n\n38:23.760 --> 38:26.760\nAll right, here we go.\n\n38:26.760 --> 38:27.760\nHowler monkey.\n\n38:27.760 --> 38:28.760\nNope.\n\n38:28.760 --> 38:30.760\nUh, non-howler monkey.\n\n38:30.760 --> 38:33.760\nBird, some kind of bird.\n\n38:33.760 --> 38:34.760\nRhesus macaque.\n\n38:34.760 --> 38:37.760\nI know what that is.\n\n38:37.760 --> 38:42.760\nThat's, that's, that's one of those little fuckers, a fox.\n\n38:42.760 --> 38:44.760\nDingo's fighting again.\n\n38:44.760 --> 38:45.760\nA double weasel.\n\n38:45.760 --> 38:46.760\nAngry dog.\n\n38:46.760 --> 38:48.760\nYou guys were close with Gibbon.\n\n38:48.760 --> 38:52.760\nGibbon, Gibbon, it goes to the stage chief and they won the winner.\n\n38:52.760 --> 38:54.760\nIt's okay.\n\n38:54.760 --> 38:56.760\nThey did all right.\n\n38:56.760 --> 38:57.760\nLet's have a hand for Sam back there.\n\n38:57.760 --> 39:00.760\nAnd you win not having to talk to me about this bid after the show.\n\n39:00.760 --> 39:03.760\nThat's not, you know, everyone's free to fail here at Harmontown.\n\n39:03.760 --> 39:07.760\nIt's not, you're not supposed to come up with a game show on the fly.\n\n39:07.760 --> 39:10.760\nThat's not your responsibility, baby.\n\n39:10.760 --> 39:12.760\nBaby, I love you.\n\n39:12.760 --> 39:16.760\nI love you too.\n\n39:16.760 --> 39:18.760\nSomeone boo'd love.\n\n39:18.760 --> 39:19.760\nI heard one guy boo love.\n\n39:19.760 --> 39:20.760\nWho was it?\n\n39:20.760 --> 39:23.760\nAll right, what's your name?\n\n39:23.760 --> 39:24.760\nJosh.\n\n39:24.760 --> 39:25.760\nBring him up to the stage.\n\n39:25.760 --> 39:26.760\nJosh boo'd love.\n\n39:26.760 --> 39:27.760\nCome on up, Josh.\n\n39:27.760 --> 39:28.760\nJosh.\n\n39:28.760 --> 39:34.760\nI may be bad with sound effects, but I can fucking tuck lava all day.\n\n39:34.760 --> 39:35.760\nAll right.\n\n39:35.760 --> 39:36.760\nLet's do it.\n\n39:36.760 --> 39:39.760\nLet's play a segment called Who Hurt You?\n\n39:39.760 --> 39:41.760\nIt was Dan Harmon.\n\n39:41.760 --> 39:47.760\nLet's also play a segment called Know It None If Your Friends Would Hold Your T-shirt.\n\n39:47.760 --> 39:49.760\nI'm sorry I bought one.\n\n39:49.760 --> 39:50.760\nNo, no, it's okay.\n\n39:50.760 --> 39:51.760\nI'm sorry, Josh?\n\n39:51.760 --> 39:52.760\nYes, that's right.\n\n39:52.760 --> 39:53.760\nYes, okay.\n\n39:53.760 --> 39:54.760\nAll right, Josh.\n\n39:54.760 --> 39:55.760\nLet's do it.\n\n39:55.760 --> 39:56.760\nJeff writes down everybody's name on a comment.\n\n39:56.760 --> 39:57.760\nWho hurt you, Josh?\n\n39:57.760 --> 39:59.760\nI don't think anybody did.\n\n39:59.760 --> 40:00.760\nReally?\n\n40:00.760 --> 40:01.760\nYeah.\n\n40:01.760 --> 40:04.760\nWell, why boo love?\n\n40:04.760 --> 40:06.760\nWhy not?\n\n40:06.760 --> 40:10.760\nAre you booing our love specifically, or just love in general?\n\n40:10.760 --> 40:11.760\nNo, I don't know.\n\n40:11.760 --> 40:14.760\nYour love kind of destroyed an episode, kind of.\n\n40:14.760 --> 40:19.760\nA few nights ago.\n\n40:19.760 --> 40:21.760\nI love you guys, seriously.\n\n40:21.760 --> 40:26.760\nWere you bummed out that there was one less free episode that was funny?\n\n40:26.760 --> 40:29.760\nWhat are you having to do?\n\n40:29.760 --> 40:31.760\nIt was just awkward.\n\n40:31.760 --> 40:32.760\nI agree.\n\n40:32.760 --> 40:37.760\nWell, is it more or less awkward than not communicating with people?\n\n40:37.760 --> 40:40.760\nLike, if we're like five questions deep into a conversation and every answer is,\n\n40:40.760 --> 40:45.760\nI don't know, or nothing, or a snarky comeback.\n\n40:45.760 --> 40:49.760\nLike, is that graceful or is that...\n\n40:49.760 --> 40:50.760\nYou don't know.\n\n40:50.760 --> 40:53.760\nWhat's your point?\n\n40:53.760 --> 40:58.760\nI come from the mind space that it's better to go with the flow and kind of say what's\n\n40:58.760 --> 40:59.760\non your mind.\n\n40:59.760 --> 41:05.760\nYou can't tell me there's not one person in the history of your life that hurt you.\n\n41:05.760 --> 41:06.760\nMaybe.\n\n41:06.760 --> 41:11.760\nI feel like Josh might have a bigger issue with me.\n\n41:11.760 --> 41:13.760\nOh, not at all.\n\n41:13.760 --> 41:14.760\nOh, really?\n\n41:14.760 --> 41:15.760\nI think that's cool.\n\n41:15.760 --> 41:18.760\nI think you're projecting.\n\n41:18.760 --> 41:20.760\nNo, come on.\n\n41:20.760 --> 41:21.760\nHow many...\n\n41:21.760 --> 41:23.760\nI mean, I'm not even going to assume...\n\n41:23.760 --> 41:25.760\nYou've had relationships, right?\n\n41:25.760 --> 41:27.760\nYeah.\n\n41:27.760 --> 41:30.760\nWas there one that ended that you didn't want to end?\n\n41:30.760 --> 41:32.760\nI suppose that's probably true.\n\n41:32.760 --> 41:33.760\nYeah.\n\n41:33.760 --> 41:40.760\nAnd when you did your podcast tour across the country...\n\n41:40.760 --> 41:43.760\nWhen there were stresses that arose.\n\n41:43.760 --> 41:45.760\nHow did you feel about it?\n\n41:45.760 --> 41:47.760\nI love your podcast.\n\n41:47.760 --> 41:50.760\nThe best cast?\n\n41:50.760 --> 41:51.760\nGreat.\n\n41:51.760 --> 41:53.760\nThis is going down a bad road.\n\n41:53.760 --> 41:55.760\nThis is not a Harmontown.\n\n41:55.760 --> 41:58.760\nThis is not a road to Harmontown.\n\n41:58.760 --> 42:00.760\nI'm celebrating as fast.\n\n42:00.760 --> 42:01.760\nHe booed love.\n\n42:01.760 --> 42:03.760\nWe brought him up.\n\n42:03.760 --> 42:06.760\nWe're not going down his wardrobe.\n\n42:06.760 --> 42:12.760\nWe want to get to know him, talk to him, try to break through to something human.\n\n42:12.760 --> 42:15.760\nI don't want to hug him.\n\n42:15.760 --> 42:18.760\nI think this is a nice thing to talk about.\n\n42:18.760 --> 42:23.760\nJosh, why do you feel our love ruined a podcast?\n\n42:23.760 --> 42:27.760\nThe podcast was going and it was a lot of fun.\n\n42:27.760 --> 42:33.760\nThen it just kind of hit this weird train wreck.\n\n42:33.760 --> 42:35.760\nIt's okay, guys.\n\n42:35.760 --> 42:36.760\nIt's true.\n\n42:36.760 --> 42:37.760\nIt's true.\n\n42:37.760 --> 42:40.760\nI'm just saying how I feel, man.\n\n42:40.760 --> 42:41.760\nI was kind of into it.\n\n42:41.760 --> 42:44.760\nI liked it, but I guess it was about me.\n\n42:44.760 --> 42:46.760\nI guess it was about someone else's relationship.\n\n42:46.760 --> 42:48.760\nI don't know.\n\n42:48.760 --> 42:52.760\nI can't really listen to it through anyone else's ears though.\n\n42:52.760 --> 42:58.760\nIt's probably like a half hour longer than it needed to be in terms of talking about relationships.\n\n42:58.760 --> 43:01.760\nTo be honest, I listened to the entire thing.\n\n43:01.760 --> 43:03.760\nIt's not like I turned it off or anything.\n\n43:03.760 --> 43:07.760\nYou were riveted.\n\n43:07.760 --> 43:13.760\nWell, I'm sorry for making the podcast not funny.\n\n43:13.760 --> 43:15.760\nJosh is mad at me, Dan.\n\n43:15.760 --> 43:16.760\nI'm telling you.\n\n43:16.760 --> 43:17.760\nHe's mad at you?\n\n43:17.760 --> 43:18.760\nYes, he is.\n\n43:18.760 --> 43:19.760\nIt's okay.\n\n43:19.760 --> 43:23.760\nI'm the girlfriend who came on stage and was in a tizzy.\n\n43:23.760 --> 43:25.760\nAs I explained in the Chicago podcast,\n\n43:25.760 --> 43:28.760\nI was upset about a previous fight and things.\n\n43:28.760 --> 43:31.760\nCan I walk you guys through an alternate scenario?\n\n43:31.760 --> 43:35.760\nYes, yes, yes.\n\n43:35.760 --> 43:38.760\nDan's in the crowd talking to people.\n\n43:38.760 --> 43:40.760\nSomething happens about love.\n\n43:40.760 --> 43:43.760\nA bunch of people start cheering.\n\n43:43.760 --> 43:45.760\nFeeling the need to break the mold,\n\n43:45.760 --> 43:49.760\nhe boos whatever reaction is being cheered.\n\n43:49.760 --> 43:54.760\nCalled out by Dan, he acquiesce coming up on stage,\n\n43:54.760 --> 43:57.760\nproceeds to fail to answer the questions you want him to ask,\n\n43:57.760 --> 43:59.760\nand when he comes to a question he can ask,\n\n43:59.760 --> 44:01.760\nhe answers in a way he hopes will be entertaining,\n\n44:01.760 --> 44:04.760\nand is then torn apart for it.\n\n44:04.760 --> 44:12.760\nThe real star of the show, of course, is Spencer.\n\n44:12.760 --> 44:15.760\nI think we're all just raw and vulnerable up here, you guys.\n\n44:15.760 --> 44:16.760\nIt's fine.\n\n44:16.760 --> 44:18.760\nWell, I know, and this isn't a dick,\n\n44:18.760 --> 44:20.760\nbut I know that everything that you say up here,\n\n44:20.760 --> 44:22.760\nJosh, as you're speaking honestly about your feelings,\n\n44:22.760 --> 44:25.760\nyou're going to make sure that it's hilarious.\n\n44:25.760 --> 44:30.760\nI like it when people laugh, yeah.\n\n44:30.760 --> 44:35.760\nI'm just kidding. I'm sorry for your bad podcast\n\n44:35.760 --> 44:37.760\nnot being very funny.\n\n44:37.760 --> 44:42.760\nYou already said that.\n\n44:42.760 --> 44:45.760\nIn order for Josh to be mad at you,\n\n44:45.760 --> 44:48.760\nI think Josh would have to be in love with me.\n\n44:48.760 --> 44:50.760\nHe's mad at our relationship.\n\n44:50.760 --> 44:52.760\nHe doesn't think that it makes for entertaining.\n\n44:52.760 --> 44:55.760\nHe was like, well, we're having fun in the Pittsburgh show,\n\n44:55.760 --> 44:58.760\nand then all of a sudden we're talking about things\n\n44:58.760 --> 45:00.760\nthat are kind of common, probably,\n\n45:00.760 --> 45:04.760\nlike the sound of a man and a woman going back and forth\n\n45:04.760 --> 45:06.760\nabout who hurt who more and who needs to change\n\n45:06.760 --> 45:08.760\nand who doesn't need to change.\n\n45:08.760 --> 45:10.760\nFor some people, it might be riveting,\n\n45:10.760 --> 45:14.760\nand for other people, inaccessible.\n\n45:14.760 --> 45:16.760\nFrigid.\n\n45:16.760 --> 45:19.760\nThat was a dumb, obvious, easy joke.\n\n45:19.760 --> 45:22.760\nIt's stupid.\n\n45:22.760 --> 45:26.760\nI think Spencer's theory is the most accurate.\n\n45:26.760 --> 45:31.760\nI think Josh is dressed perfectly.\n\n45:31.760 --> 45:33.760\nWe're all good human beings.\n\n45:33.760 --> 45:35.760\nAaron's doing a great job.\n\n45:35.760 --> 45:37.760\nI thought the Pittsburgh show was excellent.\n\n45:37.760 --> 45:40.760\nUnpredictable turns and all.\n\n45:40.760 --> 45:42.760\nI do what I say to Josh,\n\n45:42.760 --> 45:44.760\nand I said this in the Chicago show,\n\n45:44.760 --> 45:47.760\nbut if there's any worry that Dan was going to censor himself\n\n45:47.760 --> 45:51.760\nbecause I talked about something that bummed me out,\n\n45:51.760 --> 45:53.760\nhe definitely isn't.\n\n45:53.760 --> 45:57.760\nThere's an understandable fear, and I'm sorry about that.\n\n45:57.760 --> 45:59.760\nThat's all.\n\n45:59.760 --> 46:03.760\nAdventure.\n\n46:03.760 --> 46:06.760\nAlright, Josh, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for...\n\n46:06.760 --> 46:09.760\nAlso, Matt, ladies and gentlemen, thank you.\n\n46:09.760 --> 46:11.760\nPoor Matt.\n\n46:11.760 --> 46:15.760\nMatt, come up here for a second.\n\n46:15.760 --> 46:18.760\nYay, Matt!\n\n46:18.760 --> 46:21.760\nFor you guys listening in the audience,\n\n46:21.760 --> 46:26.760\nMatt is the name of the guy that was on Spencer's team\n\n46:26.760 --> 46:30.760\nduring a sound effect game show\n\n46:30.760 --> 46:35.760\nthat may or may not be in the edited show you're listening to.\n\n46:35.760 --> 46:37.760\nHe was put on a team with Spencer\n\n46:37.760 --> 46:42.760\nand has been standing behind me next to Spencer\n\n46:42.760 --> 46:45.760\njust kind of hanging out this entire time.\n\n46:45.760 --> 46:47.760\nHe guessed the donkey, yeah.\n\n46:47.760 --> 46:49.760\nGreat seat, though.\n\n46:49.760 --> 46:53.760\nBut it's hard to tell if we edit out Josh or the audio game show\n\n46:53.760 --> 46:57.760\nor we don't know what will be frog DNA\n\n46:57.760 --> 46:59.760\nand what will be dinosaur DNA.\n\n46:59.760 --> 47:01.760\nWe're after the show.\n\n47:01.760 --> 47:03.760\nWell, it just seemed like no one was controlling.\n\n47:03.760 --> 47:04.760\nRight, right.\n\n47:04.760 --> 47:05.760\nOr there was no show.\n\n47:05.760 --> 47:10.760\nLadies and gentlemen, goodnight!\n\n47:10.760 --> 47:12.760\nGong.\n\n47:12.760 --> 47:16.760\nMatt, I think you've paid your dues.\n\n47:16.760 --> 47:19.760\nLet's get to know you and touch your heart.\n\n47:19.760 --> 47:20.760\nWe do.\n\n47:20.760 --> 47:22.760\nAre you from Minneapolis?\n\n47:22.760 --> 47:23.760\nI am from Minneapolis.\n\n47:23.760 --> 47:24.760\nWhat do you do here?\n\n47:24.760 --> 47:25.760\nI'm a writer.\n\n47:25.760 --> 47:26.760\nYou're a writer?\n\n47:26.760 --> 47:27.760\nOh, wow. What kind of writer?\n\n47:27.760 --> 47:28.760\nCorporate writer.\n\n47:28.760 --> 47:29.760\nOh, what is that?\n\n47:29.760 --> 47:30.760\nYou're specific.\n\n47:30.760 --> 47:31.760\nWhat is that?\n\n47:31.760 --> 47:32.760\nWhat does that entail?\n\n47:32.760 --> 47:34.760\nBusiness writer, advertising, that kind of thing.\n\n47:34.760 --> 47:36.760\nLike a gun for hire or you work for a company?\n\n47:36.760 --> 47:37.760\nI work for a company.\n\n47:37.760 --> 47:38.760\nCan you say which one?\n\n47:38.760 --> 47:39.760\nI can't, unfortunately.\n\n47:39.760 --> 47:40.760\nMicrosoft?\n\n47:40.760 --> 47:42.760\nThere we go.\n\n47:42.760 --> 47:43.760\nWhat?\n\n47:43.760 --> 47:45.760\nMy fiance just said CIA, so.\n\n47:45.760 --> 47:46.760\nWhat?\n\n47:46.760 --> 47:47.760\nNo, not really.\n\n47:47.760 --> 47:48.760\nShut up.\n\n47:48.760 --> 47:49.760\nYeah.\n\n47:49.760 --> 47:50.760\nNo.\n\n47:50.760 --> 47:59.760\nIf someone says they can't say what they work for and then they go, CIA, it could be\n\n47:59.760 --> 48:00.760\ntrue.\n\n48:00.760 --> 48:01.760\nI don't know.\n\n48:01.760 --> 48:03.760\nI hate to be so secretive.\n\n48:03.760 --> 48:07.760\nNo, you just don't want to, it's McDonald's or something and you don't want to be on a\n\n48:07.760 --> 48:08.760\npodcast saying.\n\n48:08.760 --> 48:09.760\nI want to still be employed.\n\n48:09.760 --> 48:10.760\nYeah, exactly.\n\n48:10.760 --> 48:13.760\nYeah, we did a show in Chicago and I was kind of like, oh, I just started talking about\n\n48:13.760 --> 48:15.760\npeople I'm working for.\n\n48:15.760 --> 48:18.760\nThat hasn't podcast yet, but I cringe a little bit when I hear it.\n\n48:18.760 --> 48:20.760\nIt's awesome though, so it has to go out there.\n\n48:20.760 --> 48:24.760\nBut unlike you, I make my living getting fired.\n\n48:24.760 --> 48:30.760\nThat is my livelihood in a roundabout way.\n\n48:30.760 --> 48:39.760\nI'm like a weird kind of frog with an ass for a head that jumps.\n\n48:39.760 --> 48:42.760\nWow, the sound of a frog.\n\n48:42.760 --> 48:50.760\nAll right, Matt, Matt, what's your favorite, favorite movie?\n\n48:50.760 --> 48:52.760\nI mean, a favorite movie.\n\n48:52.760 --> 48:54.760\nI hate it when people ask that too.\n\n48:54.760 --> 48:57.760\nOkay, a favorite movie, A Serious Man.\n\n48:57.760 --> 48:58.760\nA Serious Man.\n\n48:58.760 --> 49:00.760\nOh, that is a great movie.\n\n49:00.760 --> 49:01.760\nYeah.\n\n49:01.760 --> 49:03.760\nThat's a really underrated, wonderful movie.\n\n49:03.760 --> 49:05.760\nWhich red owl played a part in?\n\n49:05.760 --> 49:07.760\nRed owl played a part in.\n\n49:07.760 --> 49:08.760\nWhoa.\n\n49:08.760 --> 49:15.760\nOkay, now we got to know, okay, who said fuck you really angrily to what?\n\n49:15.760 --> 49:17.760\nA silly man said fuck you.\n\n49:17.760 --> 49:21.760\nI mean, please come up.\n\n49:21.760 --> 49:26.760\nLike, I mean, I'm going to make this assumption about a Harmontown audience.\n\n49:26.760 --> 49:30.760\nEven though on paper, someone yelling out fuck you.\n\n49:30.760 --> 49:32.760\nCome over here, sir.\n\n49:32.760 --> 49:37.760\nShouldn't be rewarded in maybe a regular show, but usually people here have something on their mind.\n\n49:37.760 --> 49:38.760\nWhat's your name?\n\n49:38.760 --> 49:39.760\nMy name's Joe.\n\n49:39.760 --> 49:40.760\nHi, Joe.\n\n49:40.760 --> 49:41.760\nHow are you doing?\n\n49:41.760 --> 49:42.760\nI'm doing okay.\n\n49:42.760 --> 49:45.760\nJoe, explain the reaction.\n\n49:45.760 --> 49:47.760\nThank you for welcoming me to Harmontown.\n\n49:47.760 --> 49:50.760\nOh, no problem.\n\n49:50.760 --> 49:53.760\nComptrolling disaster.\n\n49:53.760 --> 49:55.760\nSpencer, nearly.\n\n49:55.760 --> 49:56.760\nAll right, I got it.\n\n49:56.760 --> 49:57.760\nOkay.\n\n49:57.760 --> 49:58.760\nMe versus the microphone.\n\n49:58.760 --> 50:01.760\nThey just fixed the microphone for the podcast listeners.\n\n50:01.760 --> 50:02.760\nWe got it.\n\n50:02.760 --> 50:04.760\nI feel important now.\n\n50:04.760 --> 50:06.760\nIt's about backstage, so what are we doing?\n\n50:06.760 --> 50:11.760\nJoe, you're going to tell people why you yelled fuck you out.\n\n50:11.760 --> 50:14.760\nWhat were you yelling fuck you in response to?\n\n50:14.760 --> 50:15.760\nHonestly.\n\n50:15.760 --> 50:16.760\nNo, not honestly.\n\n50:16.760 --> 50:17.760\nLie to us.\n\n50:17.760 --> 50:19.760\nHuh, this guy, right, guys?\n\n50:19.760 --> 50:20.760\nYes.\n\n50:20.760 --> 50:23.760\nAt least you're gone, honestly.\n\n50:23.760 --> 50:26.760\nIt was strictly to get on stage.\n\n50:26.760 --> 50:28.760\nSo you were really saying fuck you?\n\n50:28.760 --> 50:29.760\nRight.\n\n50:29.760 --> 50:34.760\nYou're kind of giving me better minds a little bit.\n\n50:34.760 --> 50:36.760\nOkay, so this is an interesting phenomenon here.\n\n50:36.760 --> 50:37.760\nI want to...\n\n50:37.760 --> 50:38.760\nI'm sorry, Dan.\n\n50:38.760 --> 50:39.760\nI want to...\n\n50:39.760 --> 50:40.760\nEveryone shut up and press...\n\n50:40.760 --> 50:41.760\nI'm going to press pause here for a second,\n\n50:41.760 --> 50:44.760\nbecause this is a very, very interesting thing that's happening here\n\n50:44.760 --> 50:47.760\nfor the second time in a row.\n\n50:47.760 --> 50:50.760\nWe finally hit this point.\n\n50:50.760 --> 50:54.760\nIn Harmontown, people who say things in the audience\n\n50:54.760 --> 50:56.760\nand how they're compelled to say things,\n\n50:56.760 --> 50:58.760\nthey get to come up on stage and we talk to them\n\n50:58.760 --> 51:00.760\nuntil we get to know them.\n\n51:00.760 --> 51:03.760\nAnd now we've reached this point where that's the second guy\n\n51:03.760 --> 51:06.760\nwho just, like Spencer said,\n\n51:06.760 --> 51:09.760\nsomeone wants to be different from the pack.\n\n51:09.760 --> 51:11.760\nThey're specifically saying things\n\n51:11.760 --> 51:13.760\nso that they can come up on stage,\n\n51:13.760 --> 51:16.760\nand at which point we're ringing a dry rag.\n\n51:16.760 --> 51:17.760\nWe're just talking to a person,\n\n51:17.760 --> 51:18.760\nhey, what do you want?\n\n51:18.760 --> 51:21.760\nWe're gonna think, to be on stage,\n\n51:21.760 --> 51:24.760\nto have my name exist,\n\n51:24.760 --> 51:26.760\nto stand.\n\n51:26.760 --> 51:27.760\nIs that totally true?\n\n51:27.760 --> 51:29.760\nWe were really saying that.\n\n51:29.760 --> 51:32.760\nI am not a dry rag.\n\n51:32.760 --> 51:35.760\nOkay, that was dehumanizing, I apologize.\n\n51:35.760 --> 51:38.760\nBut your motivation was not,\n\n51:38.760 --> 51:39.760\nyou didn't want to come up and talk about\n\n51:39.760 --> 51:42.760\na serious man being his favorite movie.\n\n51:42.760 --> 51:43.760\nNot at all.\n\n51:43.760 --> 51:45.760\nYou said, fuck you.\n\n51:45.760 --> 51:47.760\nFor the same reason that Josh booed Love,\n\n51:47.760 --> 51:48.760\nyou said, fuck you.\n\n51:48.760 --> 51:51.760\nNo, no, fuck Josh for booing Love.\n\n51:51.760 --> 51:53.760\nYeah, you're changing your story.\n\n51:53.760 --> 51:55.760\nIt's not all a tack, Josh.\n\n51:55.760 --> 52:00.760\nAll right, all right, you sit down.\n\n52:00.760 --> 52:02.760\nI'll go sit down.\n\n52:02.760 --> 52:04.760\nThank you for coming up here.\n\n52:04.760 --> 52:06.760\nTonight it may be in further shows,\n\n52:06.760 --> 52:08.760\ninstead of yelling something like, fuck you,\n\n52:08.760 --> 52:10.760\nmaybe say like, bananas in my pants,\n\n52:10.760 --> 52:12.760\nor something obscure.\n\n52:12.760 --> 52:15.760\nAll right, bananas in my pants guy, come up here,

52:26.760\nlike at the same time.\n\n52:26.760 --> 52:28.760\nOkay, all right, all right, that was a misfire.\n\n52:28.760 --> 52:30.760\nOkay, okay.\n\n52:30.760 --> 52:31.760\nSo you're a team player.\n\n52:31.760 --> 52:32.760\nWhat's your name, fella?\n\n52:32.760 --> 52:33.760\nMy name is Jaffer.\n\n52:33.760 --> 52:34.760\nIt's okay if you don't get it.\n\n52:34.760 -->

other...\n\n55:27.760 --> 55:28.760\nWhat's the other...\n\n55:28.760 --> 55:29.760\nWhat's the other...\n\n55:29.760 --> 55:32.760\nThe Twin Cities is the Saint Paul, yeah.\n\n55:32.760 --> 55:34.760\nYou guys all know Garrison Keeler?\n\n55:34.760 --> 55:35.760\nNo.\n\n55:35.760 --> 55:36.760\nIs that a hat?\n\n55:36.760 --> 55:37.760\nNo.\n\n55:37.760 --> 55:38.760\nSo you hate Garrison Keeler?\n\n55:38.760 --> 55:39.760\nYes.\n\n55:39.760 --> 55:40.760\nFuck that guy.\n\n55:40.760 --> 55:47.760\nWho hates Garrison Keeler?\n\n55:47.760 --> 55:48.760\nYou...\n\n55:48.760 --> 55:49.760\nWhy do you...\n\n55:49.760 --> 55:50.760\nWhat's your name?\n\n55:50.760 --> 55:51.760\nHe talks too slow.\n\n55:51.760 --> 55:53.760\nHe talks too slow?\n\n55:53.760 --> 55:56.760\nIs that your only reason for disliking him?\n\n55:56.760 --> 55:59.760\nDoes anyone have a better reason for disliking Garrison Keeler?\n\n55:59.760 --> 56:00.760\nYes.\n\n56:00.760 --> 56:01.760\nBecause they were joking.\n\n56:01.760 --> 56:02.760\nIt's just reality.\n\n56:02.760 --> 56:03.760\nRight.\n\n56:03.760 --> 56:04.760\nYou're not funny.\n\n56:04.760 --> 56:05.760\nIt's just Minnesota.\n\n56:05.760 --> 56:06.760\nRight.\n\n56:06.760 --> 56:07.760\nWhat?\n\n56:07.760 --> 56:08.760\nMinnesota.\n\n56:08.760 --> 56:10.760\nYeah.\n\n56:10.760 --> 56:11.760\nYeah.\n\n56:11.760 --> 56:13.760\nThat is a little annoying.\n\n56:13.760 --> 56:14.760\nShe said he sings.\n\n56:14.760 --> 56:15.760\nThat's true.\n\n56:15.760 --> 56:16.760\nHe puts himself on everything.\n\n56:16.760 --> 56:17.760\nYeah.\n\n56:17.760 --> 56:18.760\nIt's his fucking show.\n\n56:18.760 --> 56:19.760\nYeah, it is.\n\n56:19.760 --> 56:20.760\nIt's his show.\n\n56:20.760 --> 56:26.760\nHe says Arthur Keeler in the background.\n\n56:26.760 --> 56:38.560\nIf you've just joined us, Aaron asked, do you guys like Garrison Keeler to 225-year-olds\n\n56:38.560 --> 56:40.560\nwho shockingly replied, no.\n\n56:40.560 --> 56:41.560\nThere was a...\n\n56:41.560 --> 56:42.560\nThere was a mixed reaction.\n\n56:42.560 --> 56:48.880\nThe answer to the question, why not, is he's 109 years old.\n\n56:48.880 --> 56:51.560\nHis show is 70 hours long.\n\n56:51.560 --> 56:56.560\nHe sings and talks about being in a city.\n\n56:56.560 --> 57:01.800\nHe's the Dan Harmon of the future.\n\n57:01.800 --> 57:03.800\nBut then everyone started yelling at each other.\n\n57:03.800 --> 57:04.800\nThen one guy...\n\n57:04.800 --> 57:08.440\nI'm relaying this to the podcast people because no one can hear people in the audience.\n\n57:08.440 --> 57:12.960\nThen another guy said, it's his fucking show about Garrison Keeler.\n\n57:12.960 --> 57:16.720\nYou're kind of a punk rock guy sticking up for Garrison Keeler.\n\n57:16.720 --> 57:20.880\nAnd then people are going back and forth.\n\n57:20.880 --> 57:23.760\nNow you're all caught up if you're listening to this in podcast form.\n\n57:23.760 --> 57:25.760\nI like that guy.\n\n57:25.760 --> 57:29.760\nHe likes rhubarb pie and powder milk biscuit.\n\n57:29.760 --> 57:32.760\nRhubarb pie.\n\n57:32.760 --> 57:40.760\nDan, can you do a monologue as Garrison Keeler about your day?\n\n57:40.760 --> 57:41.760\nAbout...\n\n57:41.760 --> 57:45.760\nI'd like to do it about rhubarb pie.\n\n57:45.760 --> 57:51.760\nAre you going to give Jimmy your dog pomera Jimmy shirt right now?\n\n57:51.760 --> 58:01.760\nI woke up this morning in Lake Wobegon with tremendous erection.\n\n58:01.760 --> 58:10.760\nYou're a bane from Batman.\n\n58:10.760 --> 58:11.760\nJust go with it.\n\n58:11.760 --> 58:14.760\nBe bane as Garrison Keeler as you.\n\n58:14.760 --> 58:22.760\nMy cock Batman is stronger than your body.\n\n58:22.760 --> 58:26.760\nAll right, very good.\n\n58:26.760 --> 58:28.760\nLet's do some D&D.\n\n58:28.760 --> 58:48.760\nThe weather in Lake Wobegon, Gotham, Lake Gotham, the people will no longer stand for rhubarb pie.\n\n58:48.760 --> 59:08.760\nMargaret made her famous fruit cake and brought it over to the Jacobson's house for what promise to be a perfectly ordinary Thanksgiving.\n\n59:08.760 --> 59:24.760\nThe embers were warm, the crime was rampant, and the justice was ultimately mine.\n\n59:24.760 --> 59:26.760\nAll right.\n\n59:26.760 --> 59:28.760\nBatman.\n\n59:28.760 --> 59:30.760\nD&D and Herman, everybody.\n\n59:30.760 --> 59:47.760\nThis is from Lake Gotham, where the children are victims, the poor are enslaved, and everyone's spirit will be broken.\n\n59:47.760 --> 59:48.760\nThere we go.\n\n59:48.760 --> 59:50.760\nThat was great.\n\n59:54.760 --> 59:56.760\nD&D transitions.\n\n59:56.760 --> 01:00:01.760\nYeah, tell us what happened to catch us up in D&D land.\n\n01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:10.760\nWhen we last met our heroes deep within the Infinifish, we're journeying with Vallas and the swordsmen into the digestive tract of the beast.\n\n01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:16.760\nAfter defeating a mysterious eye-stalk monster, the group split up, each traveling down a different passage.\n\n01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:22.760\nMulraine fell down a slippery slide while Quark found a strange port in hanging from the ceiling.\n\n01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:30.760\nUsing the mysterious silver staff, Sharpie climbed up into a lattice of veins and tubules before finding a mysterious, membranous wall.\n\n01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:35.760\nQuark and Mulraine caught back up with Sharpie, and together the group entered the large organ.\n\n01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:43.760\nImmediately, a blob of sickly yellow ooze dripped down, and several lightning spiders skittered into the organ from above.\n\n01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.760\nIt was time to fight.\n\n01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.760\nThat's everybody.\n\n01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:57.760\nAll right, let's dramatically, let me step the stage, you guys, it just slashed through the wall of a giant organ and climbed inside,\n\n01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:07.760\nand a large blob of goo dropped down from the ceiling, and it was followed by sparks of light that kind of skittered around as if they had spidery limbs.\n\n01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.760\nRight, right.\n\n01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.760\nSo, in this episode, do we pretend Jeff wasn't there?\n\n01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:19.760\nFor the purposes of this episode, Quark will be played by Spencer Crittenden.\n\n01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:23.760\nYeah!\n\n01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.760\nThanks, guys.\n\n01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.760\nQuark's going to like Mulraine in this episode.\n\n01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.760\nWho knows what's going to happen?\n\n01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.760\nLet's work together.\n\n01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.760\nTake notes, man.\n\n01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.760\nThe Dungeon Masters find a character.\n\n01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:40.760\nSpencer, let's glue our arms together for life so when Jeff comes back, we're one being.\n\n01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.760\nJust an idea.\n\n01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.760\nThat's a good plan.\n\n01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.760\nAll right, so these are spider creatures?\n\n01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.760\nThere's spider lightning creatures in a multi-limbed blob on the ground.\n\n01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.760\nMulti-limbed blob, spider, lightning spider creatures.\n\n01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.760\nIt sounds like a day at the office.\n\n01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:04.760\nOh.\n\n01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.760\nFestival.\n\n01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:12.760\nI just tasted what Rob Schneider had for lunch last Wednesday.\n\n01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:17.760\nSpencer, are the lightning spiders trying to attack us?\n\n01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:23.760\nAs it happens, the lightning spiders are crawling over the cut that you slashed in the wall.\n\n01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.760\nThey're sewing it back together.\n\n01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:32.760\nThe slimy blob whips around a tendular too and goo is cast all about the organ.\n\n01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.760\nIt seems like it's going to be hard to move about.\n\n01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.760\nWell, I appreciate the craftiness.\n\n01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.760\nYeah, because the goo is sticky?\n\n01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:45.760\nYou haven't touched it, but goo tends to be.\n\n01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.760\nYou haven't met my goo.\n\n01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.760\nOh, damn.\n\n01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.760\nSmooth as silk.\n\n01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:00.760\nSlippery is a baby in January.\n\n01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.760\nTwo years blueberry bubblegum.\n\n01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:11.760\nAnd there's no way we're getting out of this room without either retreating,\n\n01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.760\nwhich doesn't even seem possible because the hole is being sewed up,\n\n01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.760\nor confronting this thing.\n\n01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.760\nWe're not able to be the coward that I'd like to be.\n\n01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.760\nCorrect.\n\n01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.760\nTo the lightning creatures approach.\n\n01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.760\nI shoot two arrows.\n\n01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.760\nWhat kind of arrows?\n\n01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.760\nAdventure arrows?\n\n01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.760\nNo, you have the special kind that are good for shooting regular arrows,\n\n01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.760\ngood arrows, sleep arrows, V arrows.\n\n01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.760\nDoes good just mean good skill?\n\n01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.760\nIt does extra damage against evil creatures.\n\n01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.760\nTwo good arrows.\n\n01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.760\nWhat was that, Sharpie?\n\n01:03:54.760 --> 01:04:00.760\nI remember him telling you there was a type of arrow you had that was optimized for multiple arrow shooting.\n\n01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.760\nYeah, isn't it true?\n\n01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.760\nIt's true.\n\n01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.760\nI already rolled the dice.\n\n01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.760\nV arrows?\n\n01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.760\nOne of your good arrows strikes the lightning directly in the center of mass.\n\n01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.760\nIt does six damage.\n\n01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:20.760\nSpencer, are my double arrows the V arrows?\n\n01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.760\nYeah, V arrows.\n\n01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.760\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.760\nWhat about her second arrow?\n\n01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.760\nI got a bad feeling about this.\n\n01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.760\nI just missed.\n\n01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.760\nIt didn't go into anything comically.\n\n01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.760\nIt went to heaven. God ate it.\n\n01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.760\nAll right.\n\n01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.760\nNo, sir, I have to warn you.\n\n01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.760\nI don't know if you heard the Brooklyn show,\n\n01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.760\nbut after giving Ray of Frost its own theme song,\n\n01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.760\nwe found out it is a level zero spell that does a maximum of three damage.\n\n01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:57.760\nWe're going to need to start getting enthusiastic about what I'm told is my most powerful spell.\n\n01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.760\nScorching Ray!\n\n01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.760\nScorching Ray!\n\n01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:11.760\nDraw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw\n\n01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.760\nScorching Ray is here.\n\n01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.760\nHit the...\n\n01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.760\nHit the...\n\n01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.760\nScorching Ray doing a fearn from the fuckers!\n\n01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.760\nFuck your mama.\n\n01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.760\nOkay\n\n01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:36.120\nWho do you fire it at there's the slime blob and some lightning things?

I don't know about that\n\n01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.660\nI thought I might just go into a barbarian rage\n\n01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:48.900\nBut first you gotta if something happens to me you gotta you gotta take my smokesticks\n\n01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:54.900\nI'm trying to quit but here will grab your smokesticks grabbing his smokestips\n\n01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.340\nHe whips out his sword\n\n01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:02.360\nHis muscles rise and grow en masse as he falls into the barbarian rage\n\n01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:10.020\nRed goes over his eyes as all semblance of reason exits his head and he charges himself directly at the slime monster\n\n01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:18.020\nAnd he misses\n\n01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:20.820\nSharpie\n\n01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:28.860\nYes, I know this might be dangerous, but I have a few I have 20, but I can only shoot two at a time\n\n01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:32.220\nI have the arrows. Yeah. Yeah, those are optimized for shooting well\n\n01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:42.380\nMore than what I shoot to vagina arrows\n\n01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:51.900\nWhich means that they're complicated smooth and pink\n\n01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.940\nAnd they have teeth, right\n\n01:09:55.940 --> 01:10:05.340\nYour arrows fail to hit their mark they plant harmlessly in the side of the membrane\n\n01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:08.420\nWell, it's still cute. It's still cute with it arguable\n\n01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:15.620\nOne of the lightning creatures approaches and jumps directly on a Sharpie's face\n\n01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:19.420\nNo, you take six damage and you have a thing on your face\n\n01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:27.300\nThat's a secondary effect. Yep. I only have 24 hit points total was I at full health before this fight started?\n\n01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:32.620\nYeah, you you got some of those crystals from the broken healing pendant.

No\n\n01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:32.500\nAaron Aaron, I know these things\n\n01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.060\nTo make up an error\n\n01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.140\nBoy, oh Aaron I\n\n01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:51.020\nShoot a baby arrow into Sharpie's heart\n\n01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:58.260\nI shoot a good okay, I shoot a good arrow\n\n01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:04.640\nOkay, and I shoot it good at his face. No, I shoot it at the spider on his face\n\n01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.200\nWell, if it's on his face right now, then yes. Yeah, but there's also other spiders\n\n01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.800\nSo I mean well the one the one that is is most threatening Sharpie.
