00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Minneapolis! Welcome!

00:06.000 --> 00:30.000
Harmontown is now in session. Please welcome the stage, the person who is going to make this night the best night of your life, Mr. Dan Harmon!

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
Twin Town! I'm sure that's what they call it. Twin Town. You know, they call it the Twin City, right?

00:40.000 --> 00:54.000
Because there's a higher proportion of identical twins per capita. I think it's the power lines. It affects the genetics of the sperms and the ova.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
But they're happy. They're happy people that way.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
They look very happy and very good looking!

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
Half of them are very good looking. The other half are fortunate enough to look exactly like those people.

01:10.000 --> 01:21.000
And they never know which half is just riding the coattails. And they have frequent arguments about it during what they call the festival hour.

01:21.000 --> 01:36.000
Don't mind my sound effects? Every time you say festival hour, you'll hear a gong.

01:36.000 --> 01:52.000
I appreciate the added layer of sound effects. I'm not giving a note, but I don't know if you're being 28-year-old, you're familiar with the history of the gong and entertainment.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
It has a sort of legacy.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
It's the noise of festivals.

02:01.000 --> 02:11.000
Erin McGathy, Comptrolling, everybody. I'm excited about it.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
I just noticed that there's a camera on my face. Documentaries.

02:17.000 --> 02:27.000
We're making a movie here too. You're all in it. You're in little shadowy faces. Did they put a camera on anyone's head in the front row? Sometimes they do that.

02:27.000 --> 02:38.000
I notice it halfway through the show and then I want them to take like five bucks off the ticket for the guy that has to wear a camera on his head.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
I've worn that thing. It's like a jockstrap on your head.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
It hurts. I wore it in New York and you told me I looked like a cloud-outless character because I pushed all my skin down.

02:49.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, she looked like Holly Berry when she was the old Chinese man. Like Chaka from Land of the Lost.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
The crazy thing about wearing that in New York, no one mentioned that. Everyone came up to the merch table and was like,

03:03.000 --> 03:19.000
hey, I'm going to get a t-shirt and a thing. Everyone's so used to having cameras on them.

03:19.000 --> 03:34.000
Two cities right next to each other. Even buildings can have sisters and brothers. Got two towns that you can go to either one.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
I fucked your mama like a hot dog bun. Put my wiener inside with my mustard on top.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
Fuck your mama like a broom and a mop. Clean her pussy out. Made broom for more.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Fuck your mama on the ceiling and the floor. Fuck your mama.

03:50.000 --> 04:02.000
That was good. That was good. God damn it. I'm getting really good at rapping.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
Yay, festival!

04:07.000 --> 04:14.000
Alright, it's a new tradition. Yeah, there were like eight things that rhymed in there.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
That was very good. That was really good.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
None of them were mouth and south.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
And you really used your floor space.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah, I'm getting good at dancing too. I'm getting really good at dancing and rapping.

04:28.000 --> 04:37.000
I started the tour just going like this. But now I kind of put some stopping and starting into it.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
I'm going to go somewhere and then I...

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Amazing.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
I get out of breath sooner though doing that because it's like a treadmill.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Jesus Christ.

04:49.000 --> 04:59.000
Dance is a great dancer though. Before we were dating, there was a night that we spent last new years with Jeff Davis and he put on a song and asked you to dance to it.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
He said, Surfer Baby? Surfer Girl? Surfer Baby is not a song.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Little Surfer Girl.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Little Surfer Girl. Dan put on a little dress and danced around the living room very sensuously.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I'm sorry, Dan.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
I mean, it sounds weird on paper.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
Why on your way to a comedy show load up your iPad with gongs and fog horns?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Your boyfriend's show.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Ah, see, do I got everything in here that I want?

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
A rim shot. Fuck that.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Who needs that?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm sorry.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Was that a baby crying?

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah, it's a baby crying because everyone loves the milk of the show.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Baby crying.

05:47.000 --> 05:55.000
The baby crying reminds everyone that the show is like milk that you need when you're a baby and you can only digest breast milk and that's the idea.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
Right, right. I thought it was a six million year old sound that makes people uncomfortable.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
I thought that it was a primal, instinctive, people-upsetter.

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
Because it means that one of our species, larva, is exposed to a safer tooth, tiger.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
You know that babies cry like that because human babies, they don't have fur.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
Our primate cousins, they're covered with this thick layer of fur, like orangutan babies.

06:24.000 --> 06:32.000
The babies, they come out and they basically just cling to the mom like her fur.

06:32.000 --> 06:40.000
They walk around and they just clung there forever. It's like a little baby-bjorn until the baby finally lets go and starts doing its own thing.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
A lot of primates have similar things like that. They just cling and wrap around.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Tell me more about it.

06:47.000 --> 07:04.000
Primates, monkey super monkeys, pretty funky, got a big old brain up in their monkey head, don't fight, they think it's dead, they make fire.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Sorry, I guess that was great, but you gave me a look like that was a misstep.

07:09.000 --> 07:17.000
I don't know if Jeff would have been cute to wrap up at that point. It was headlong.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
You're right, I give myself this noise.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
It's the noise of someone alone at a party.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Okay, reset.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
Anyways, babies cry because, yeah, they're moms.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Fucked up my flow, man.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I'm sorry.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
A human baby just has an instinct, if you walk away from it, it just starts crying.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
As soon as it loses sight of a big person to protect it, it just starts crying, which on one hand is a horrible thing.

07:54.000 --> 08:03.000
They draw predators, but human babies require constant protection from the parents, and so the baby has a catastrophic response to the absence of its adult guardians.

08:03.000 --> 08:17.000
And the game of peek-a-boo, I always talk about this, is the mom hides her face from the baby, which the baby instinctively is designed to recognize as a catastrophe, that the face is gone.

08:17.000 --> 08:26.000
But kind of senses, I think I can see the Brechtian narrative here.

08:26.000 --> 08:35.000
I can see that she's still there, but I lost the face, and then the mom opens the face and goes like, peek-a-boo, and the baby goes, wait, she knows?

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
She knows that I wanted to die, and she's fucking around with it.

08:41.000 --> 08:51.000
I feel like it must not be that big a deal. It's like that first time you see Mel Brooks do a Hitler joke.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
It's kind of like, just get a big belly laugh.

08:57.000 --> 09:06.000
Okay, we have to talk about, I don't understand what you brought in your sound effects arsenal and what your intention was.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
There's a doctor named Dr. Sound Effects.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
First of all, that's not true.

09:13.000 --> 09:21.000
There's probably a website called Dr. Sound Effects, but I don't think anyone's ever gotten a PhD in what you're doing right now.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
Okay, I'll cool it on the sound effects.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
No, you don't have to do that. I'd like you to refine your targeting.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I don't? Well...

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I mean, a slide whistle?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Sorry, that was a bad one.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
No, I'll really cool it.

09:36.000 --> 09:45.000
Hey, do you have rabbit skinning in there? I was going to tell my duck joke.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
She's a good kid. She's having a good time.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
Hey, I want to bring Spencer hot sooner than later.

09:56.000 --> 10:07.000
All right, bring out Spencer.

10:07.000 --> 10:14.000
What up?

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Spencer, can you believe it?

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
No.

10:20.000 --> 10:27.000
Spencer has been my buddy on this tour. We've done a merch together and spent a lot of time together.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
And here I am with a bunch of sound effects making a show happen.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Thanks for holding down the merchandise table back there, Spencer.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Yeah, thank you very much, Spencer.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah, Minneapolis is a self-lining up city, I guess. You guys were great.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah, they seemed like good people. I really sensed that about them.

10:46.000 --> 10:54.000
By this time in Madison, somebody had already, for the sixth time, just gone like, Pringles!

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
And I went, Diabetes! You were there because it has a podcast chat.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
I was like, don't cheer Diabetes!

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
And then I have to go because the acoustics were bad.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
And then I go, what? Don't cheer Diabetes!

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
No one was going to.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Don't stop the show.

11:14.000 --> 11:21.000
I mean, we welcome people with things to get off their chest, but it's not a hockey game.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
And if it was, cheering Diabetes isn't competing with anyone.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
There's no match that's going to be lost between that team and anyone.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
I love the idea of someone with diabetes just wanting to be represented.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
We're like someone in the audience screaming, arthritis!

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Do something about arthritis!

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Cut the tunnel!

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Loops!

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
Restless leg!

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
Does anyone have an ailment that they want Dan to discuss?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
You're going to have a mouse intro? IBS?

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
IBS writes itself. What do you have in the front rows there?

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
Plantar fasciitis.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
What is your name, sir? I'm going to do it, Jeff does. What is your name?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
I'm Tony.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Tony, come on up here!

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
Here, Tony. Thank you.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Anything you don't want to talk about, you don't have to talk about it.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Harbin Town is a safe place.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I appreciate that.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
First of all, Tony is wearing a red owl t-shirt.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
That was the local grocery store in Milwaukee when I was a kid.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
It was the local grocery store in Green Bay when I was a kid.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Do they still exist?

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
One, and it's in Green Bay, and it's still fighting for its existence.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
The logo, it just stirs up. I haven't seen it in so long.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
What kind of stuff do they have at the red?

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Oh God, milk, eggs.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Produce and meat?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
You just wouldn't believe it.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Sometimes they put it in bags for you.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Incredible aisles and aisles of food with fluorescent lids.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
Is it not successful because red owl kind of sounds like a hate group?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Don't be insulted.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Oh no, no, no.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
No baby, open that shirt.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Red owl sounds more like a reverse hate group.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Like a kind of a militant.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
We are the red owls.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
It sounds like a very wise socialist organization.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
Like in Latin it says never again.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
It refers to something that happened to red people.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Never again will we let a sale pass us by.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
The red owl.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
Somebody spilled some milk in aisle 7 and we never forgot.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Alright, what's plantar fasciitis?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I'll give you one guess.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
It's when every piece of fungus on your foot unites

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
in a horrible Naziistic regime.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Which the red owls are fighting.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
No, it is foot related, but it is not fungus related.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
It's severe scarring of the large tendon that runs under your foot.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
It makes you limp and it makes you look like you're 20 years older than you actually are.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Wait, you mean your gait doesn't actually have the effect on you?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
No.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Do you have it?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Yes, I do.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
You just mean it makes you walk like you're 20 years older.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah, it gives you the hobbling gait of a 60 year old man.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Can you show us?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh, Tony, you look very young.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Thank you.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Do you want to give us a little runway?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I'm going to have him walk.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Well, I should give you some walking music, I guess.

14:46.000 --> 14:55.000
Right now it's in remission, so I used to walk like normal people, which was back and forth.

14:55.000 --> 15:02.000
And then it struck and sometimes you get up and you use your foot and it feels like this.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
Oh, because the tendon is like not doing what it's supposed to do.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
No, and then so you have to sit down a lot and people ask you, why are you so lazy?

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Oh, and you're like, fuck you, I have hysteria.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
And they go, does that have something to do with fungus?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
No.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
Play that song again, you know, it was really moved.

15:52.000 --> 16:00.000
Don't be beaten today, double rhyme scheme.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
That was A-B-A-B, no one was impressed, alright?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I was damn impressed.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Okay, never mind, fuck it.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
No, you know what, I have worse than a plancher's fascitis.

16:11.000 --> 16:19.000
I have audience unappreciative titis.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
I wish I just couldn't walk.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
I can't be appreciated.

16:25.000 --> 16:32.000
That's the disease that infects the lower base of the brain and makes further audience applause completely jaded and meaningless?

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Yeah, it definitely undermines anything you get after that.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
It's linked to solicited applause syndrome, yeah.

16:40.000 --> 16:47.000
If Dan was a revival tent preacher, someone would come up and say, I can't walk,

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
and I'd be like, really? Because I had a really difficult morning.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
I was really in my head, I thought a lot about my life, and I didn't know if I've done enough so far.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Just sit down.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
Well Tony, I have a very special surprise for you, because here in the audience here in Minneapolis,

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
Twin Town as I call it, is a fellow cast away from an old improv troupe.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
I used to be in Milwaukee called The Dead Ale Wives.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
One of my old comedy stage partners, Sean McKenna is here.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Woo! Let's bring Sean McKenna to the stage!

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Okay, okay, sorry.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Jesus, sweetie, what is happening? You're like...

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Uh, stroke.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Holy shit.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
It's like the second act of RoboCop 2 up here.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
Just shooting fire hydrants and giving candy to bank robbers.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
This is after Kane took him apart and put him together?

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Don't scrutinize my knowledge of RoboCop 2.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Not scrutinizing, just horrifying.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
It's when they reprogrammed him, you know, and then he was like, you know,

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
all of you kids could rob this door and RoboCop 2 is a shitty movie.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Don't smoke.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
Oh, hey Dan, I think someone's at the door.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
It's Sean McKenna.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Tony, I'll get it.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
Here's the amazing thing. Look Tony, Sean McKenna also can't walk.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
Oh my god. He broke his ankles walking on ice, which is why I left.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
If you don't know, he's also a member of the Dead Ale Wives.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
Thank you to the three people.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Ever heard of us.

18:27.000 --> 18:33.000
Sean, Sean, tonight just became the first member of the Harmontown Art Players.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
And we should probably bring Eric Noble up too, he's in the audience.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Oh, hell yeah.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
I thought he was safe back there.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Very funny gentleman.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Did he start Minneapolis Comedy Sports? I can't remember which city.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
He started it, yeah.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
No, it started in it?

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Oh, started in it, yeah. He's also working with the huge theater.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Oh, someone's at the door.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Oh, shit, the doorbell's broken.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
Oh, it's the second member of the Harmontown Art Players, Eric Noble.

19:03.000 --> 19:11.000
Okay, all right, let's thank Tony and have him limp down to the front row with his planter fascinist.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah, that ain't shit.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Sorry, Dan, that was a controlling moment.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Check that. Check that.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
I got a pump on it too.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Oh, that's cool.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Sorry, you can't hear that.

19:25.000 --> 19:38.000
Tony, what do you want more than anything in the world?

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
I don't know, just name something you like.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
The newest season of Dr. Who sooner.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Okay, all right, perfect.

19:46.000 --> 19:54.000
Tony would like the newest season of Dr. Who to come sooner, and he has planter fascinist, which planters fascinist.

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
It erodes the tendon on his foot and makes him walk silly.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I guess I'll be playing him.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Probably a good idea, yeah.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
Okay, this is a Hallmark movie.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
It's a movie of the weak and of the heart.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Give us a...

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Got it.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
No, no, see that's...

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Okay.

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
One foot to walk on.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Mom, I'm home.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
Tony, is that you?

20:33.000 --> 20:42.000
Yeah, mom, I'm here in the kitchen mixing chocolate, icing, in a bowl, like you like it.

20:42.000 --> 20:50.000
Mom, Tony, you're walking like a fucking idiot.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
You're holding your titty in your hand, mom.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
That's my bowl of frosting, so to speak.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
But your titty's in it.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
Well, I told you it's like you like it.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Thanks, mom.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
That's why I've stayed here 25 years.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
I brought somebody home with me.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
He's a fellow member of the Dr. Who Society.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
You know, at school, Keith.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
I mean, hello, stranger.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
Yes, I've never been here before to your home.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
Is that a titty in a bowl?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Yes, that must be...

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I wouldn't know it if I saw it.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
Okay, mom.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
Mom, just be cool.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Well, my new friend is here.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Because I'm really gimpy.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
And I got a beard.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Tony, really, I'm on the clock here.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
I don't really know what gimps, you know, terribly often.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Well, you two probably want your privacy.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I'll go in the living room and watch...

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
No, no, no, no. Why don't you...

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
Why don't you stay?

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
I'll leave.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
Thank you.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Jesus Christ, hurry it up, Tony.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Seriously.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
Are you going to try to go up all those stairs right now?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Is that what you're going to do?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I can't.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
Why is there a wrapping room going up the stairs?

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
There's, like, 21 stairs, Tony.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I got it.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Just going by homemade TARDIS.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
You have to come back down those stairs at some point.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
I'm upstairs now.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
It's a podcast.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
The next day at the hospital...

23:06.000 --> 23:14.000
I don't understand the soundtrack at all.

23:14.000 --> 23:24.000
Mr.... Tony... Tony Scott? Tony Scott, yes.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Too soon?

23:27.000 --> 23:33.000
I tried to kill myself.

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
It's two soundtrack songs.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
It's a binary movie.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Can I make you a drink?

23:44.000 --> 23:52.000
Mr. Scott, I'm afraid you have planter's fascitis.

23:52.000 --> 24:00.000
It means you'll never be able to walk normally again.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
At least I'll get to watch the next season for Dr. Who here.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
Tony, there's something I have to tell you.

24:08.000 --> 24:15.000
Watching Dr. Who is what is eating away at the tendon on your foot.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
You see, British sci-fi programming stimulates a part of the brain

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
that sends a signal to the athletic portions of the body,

24:25.000 --> 24:33.000
causing them to wither.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Have you told my mother?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Yeah, I mentioned it.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Do you have a mother?

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
Have I met her?

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
Everyone met my mother?

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Yeah, I'm sure I told her.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
If I met her, I can't remember.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Just cut it off.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Okay.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I'll never dance again.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
I'm going to do it with a lightsaber.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Because if I did it with a sonic screwdriver,

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
your other foot would start to rot away.

25:07.000 --> 25:13.000
Maybe if you put it in a teleport machine with a good leg,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
I don't know, it was a fly reference.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
No one's seen that.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
Let's try it.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Oh, I puked on it.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
It was the fly.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
There we go.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
I'm sorry, the Germans are coming.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
The Tony story, everybody.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
The Tony story.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Thank God.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
One foot to...

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Yeah, good job.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
All right.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
Freestyle, Minneapolis style.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
Do the...

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Oh, shit.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
What?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
What?

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Freestyle.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
What?

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
What?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Yo.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Yo.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Yo.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Yo.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Sean McKenna limping up here.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
He's going to limp around and have another beer.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
He's Sean McKenna from back in Milwaukee.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Yo, he fucked his mama so hard

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
that he rolled her in some dough and put her

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
in the tummy like the Pillsbury boy.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
He fucked his mama so hard

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
his dick felt like a toy.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Sean McKenna.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Sean McKenna.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
What?

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
Receiving everything that I'm going to give him?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Yo.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Yo.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Yo.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Yo.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Yo.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Yo.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Yo.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Yo.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Yo.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Yo.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Yo.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Yo.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Yo.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Yo.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Yo.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Yo.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Yo.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Yo.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Yo.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Yo.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Yo.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Yo.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Yo.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Yo.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Yo.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Yo.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Yo.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Yo, man.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Yo.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Yo.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Yo.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Yo.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yo.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Yo.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Yo.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Yo.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Yo.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Yo.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Yo.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Yo.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Joe.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Yo.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Yo.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Yo.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Yo.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Yo.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Yo.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Yo.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Yo.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Yo.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Yo.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Yo.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.240
It was nice, I fucked it twice, I fucked it thrice.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.280
I fucked your mama four times and more.

27:23.280 --> 27:26.760
She lost the times table so she couldn't multiply no more.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.080
But then she made a little baby for me

27:29.080 --> 27:31.960
and it came out and I said, it's face looks like pee.

27:31.960 --> 27:35.040
Yo, I fucked your mama doggy style.

27:35.040 --> 27:38.560
I fucked your mama like door pile.

27:38.560 --> 27:41.600
She's Sam, that pussy's good.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.960
I knew how I fucking would.

27:43.960 --> 27:46.000
Yo, Gomer said surprise, surprise.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.840
I fucked your mama in her mouth and came between her eyes.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.560
I fucked your mama north, I fucked your mama south.

27:51.560 --> 27:55.040
I fucked your mama in her ear, in her mouth.

27:55.040 --> 27:59.360
Yeah, Cameron, Cameron, Cameron.

27:59.360 --> 28:02.120
Dan Harmon, ladies and gentlemen.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.480
Sean McKenna.

28:03.480 --> 28:04.240
Sean McKenna, better boy.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.480
Sorry about your ankle.

28:05.480 --> 28:09.840
Before we say goodbye to Sean very quickly,

28:09.840 --> 28:12.720
maybe we can do a speed version of this.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.920
Once upon a time, who's familiar with who's

28:15.920 --> 28:19.280
on first by Abbott and Costello?

28:19.280 --> 28:24.880
Well, these guys used to do a little variation on who's

28:24.880 --> 28:25.440
on first.

28:25.440 --> 28:28.200
They would do who's on first with Abbott and Arnold

28:28.200 --> 28:30.360
Schwarzenegger.

28:30.360 --> 28:33.520
It was a very cutting edge comedic bit

28:33.520 --> 28:37.720
that we were doing as early as 94, 95.

28:37.720 --> 28:40.600
Yeah, sure.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.040
Who's going to be Abbott and who's going to be Arnold?

28:43.040 --> 28:44.960
I don't know.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.200
Which one was Abbott?

28:47.200 --> 28:50.600
I'd like to see Sean McKenna as Arnold Schwarzenegger.

28:50.600 --> 28:51.920
Let's do Arnold and Arnold.

28:51.920 --> 28:54.440
Like that, we'll do Arnold and Arnold.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.400
We're drunk one night and did Arnold and Arnold.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.200
Arnold and Arnold.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.480
Do I need a mic stand?

28:58.480 --> 28:59.160
Yeah, probably.

28:59.160 --> 29:00.840
Yeah.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.080
They really, yeah.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.000
Yeah, you need full focus on this mentally.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.600
Well, I just need some Alina.

29:06.600 --> 29:18.760
And now presenting the Harmontown players, Arnold and Arnold.

29:18.760 --> 29:20.120
Arnold.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.560
Yeah, listen.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.040
I got a baseball team.

29:26.040 --> 29:27.280
It's very nice.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.960
All right.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.920
Did you learn the name of the players?

29:30.920 --> 29:32.360
The players.

29:32.360 --> 29:33.920
I have the list right here.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.560
OK, then tell them to me.

29:35.560 --> 29:36.720
Who's on first?

29:36.720 --> 29:39.160
OK, I don't understand what you're saying.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.040
Who's on first?

29:41.040 --> 29:43.280
Why would someone that named Who be on first?

29:43.280 --> 29:44.800
Who is on first?

29:44.800 --> 29:48.960
OK, well, that's a dumb name.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.560
I don't know.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.560
Sun second?

29:52.560 --> 29:57.080
I don't know either.

29:57.080 --> 30:00.080
I don't know either.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.080
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.080
Thank you.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.080
Arnold, Arnold.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.080
Thank you.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.080
Let's hear it for Sean McKenna and Arnold.

30:05.080 --> 30:07.080
Wow.

30:07.080 --> 30:12.720
From humble beginnings, Arnold and Arnold.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.480
I feel like Eric Noble got the short end of tonight's stick.

30:15.480 --> 30:20.040
It kind of came up and, yeah, we didn't really.

30:20.040 --> 30:21.720
Someone should really control this show.

30:21.720 --> 30:25.200
Yeah, we didn't really use him.

30:25.200 --> 30:27.320
He's very talented, very funny, very handsome.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.320
Very handsome, too.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.520
Yeah, he's a brother.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.520
Very handsome.

30:31.520 --> 30:40.760
Spencer, I'm being attacked by, what's that?

30:40.760 --> 30:41.760
Arnold's monster.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.320
I'm being attacked by an Arnold monster.

30:45.320 --> 30:46.640
Someone yelled out.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.880
Someone approaches you.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.760
He's about a four foot seven or so.

30:51.760 --> 30:57.040
He pushes small children out of his way and says, get through the topper!

30:57.040 --> 30:58.040
That's all.

30:58.040 --> 31:02.920
All right, you want to hit that Spencer theme when we do that?

31:02.920 --> 31:04.920
It's her first night control.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.320
I'm having iPad troubles.

31:07.320 --> 31:10.920
Yeah, I'm not so good at the references, if you'll recall.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.440
Oh, there it is, okay.

31:12.440 --> 31:15.720
Yeah, no, yeah, we don't like to do the Hollywood stuff to Spencer.

31:15.720 --> 31:16.720
Oh, slowly.

31:16.720 --> 31:17.720
Sorry.

31:17.720 --> 31:18.720
Forced to have it.

31:18.720 --> 31:22.000
Spencer grew up in a basement that he still lives in, so there's no TV in there.

31:22.000 --> 31:28.160
He's just Dutch as a dragon's books, and unlike, he's a genius.

31:28.160 --> 31:34.040
Spencer, I'm being attacked by, shit.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.680
Lack of sound engineering skills.

31:36.680 --> 31:42.640
Walking into a non-acoustically tuned space, you suddenly realize that the variables aren't

31:42.640 --> 31:45.080
exactly lining up right.

31:45.080 --> 31:49.200
You clap your hands, and hear your hands clapping.

31:49.200 --> 31:59.600
It's a strange sensation.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.880
I'm not worthy.

32:01.880 --> 32:17.720
Spencer, I'm being attacked by a hot dish.

32:17.720 --> 32:22.880
Is that a colloquialism?

32:22.880 --> 32:23.880
It's a casserole.

32:23.880 --> 32:26.920
I'm being attacked by a hot casserole dish.

32:26.920 --> 32:31.760
Unfurling the noodles widely with an array of various meat sauces.

32:31.760 --> 32:36.400
You see the ricotta cheese dripping off the noodles.

32:36.400 --> 32:43.600
Dinner is served.

32:43.600 --> 32:51.080
One guy initiated a standing O for that, and he wasn't, you know, he's not a fat guy.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.880
He wasn't applauding the casserole.

32:52.880 --> 32:56.840
He was applauding Spencer's GM skills.

32:56.840 --> 33:02.760
All right, so, all right, is there anybody in the audience, I'm going to go out and work

33:02.760 --> 33:03.760
the crowd.

33:03.760 --> 33:04.760
Cool.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.760
You got some crowd working music?

33:06.760 --> 33:23.640
In the meanwhile, I'm going to play Polar Bear on Ice.

33:23.640 --> 33:24.640
I don't understand.

33:24.640 --> 33:32.360
I'd like to work the back of the crowd, because these people come and they don't, oh, is this

33:32.360 --> 33:33.960
what I sound like back here?

33:33.960 --> 33:35.960
That's weird.

33:35.960 --> 33:41.080
It's like those Discovery World exhibits where you talk on the phone and you can hear yourself

33:41.080 --> 33:42.480
in the ear, but on a delay.

33:42.480 --> 33:47.040
I can barely pull it together back here.

33:47.040 --> 33:51.160
My lips move, and then a second later, I hear my lips move.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.280
It probably sounds less exciting on the podcast.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.200
It probably sounds less exciting for everybody.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.800
This is just for me right now.

33:58.800 --> 34:08.360
Three hours later, wow, syllabus, red leather, yellow leather.

34:08.360 --> 34:09.360
What's your name?

34:09.360 --> 34:10.360
Sam.

34:10.360 --> 34:14.160
No, it's not.

34:14.160 --> 34:16.160
Crowd working.

34:16.160 --> 34:20.080
Sam, did your parents hit you?

34:20.080 --> 34:22.160
I don't remember.

34:22.160 --> 34:25.840
Then yes.

34:25.840 --> 34:28.680
With implements, my dad hit me with a belt.

34:28.680 --> 34:30.680
Did your mother hit you with implants?

34:30.680 --> 34:31.680
No.

34:31.680 --> 34:34.280
He said your mother hit you with implants?

34:34.280 --> 34:35.280
No.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.680
I said, did they hit you with implements?

34:37.680 --> 34:40.520
My dad, for instance, hit me with a belt.

34:40.520 --> 34:45.920
Did your parents hit you with anything, like a wooden spoon or?

34:45.920 --> 34:51.480
No, I think before I had any memories, I was fanked, but like I said, it must have hit

34:51.480 --> 34:52.480
me pretty hard.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.480
Oh, okay.

34:53.480 --> 34:54.480
Oh, man.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.480
Hey, Dan.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.480
Yeah?

34:56.480 --> 35:03.120
I have a bunch of animal sound effects up here that are pretty obscure.

35:03.120 --> 35:06.880
I'm going to play an animal sound effect.

35:06.880 --> 35:10.920
You pick a partner out there, and you guys can try to guess what the animal sound effect

35:10.920 --> 35:13.720
is as an experiment.

35:13.720 --> 35:18.960
Okay, I like Sam.

35:18.960 --> 35:19.960
Are we competing?

35:19.960 --> 35:21.960
Am I competing with Sam?

35:21.960 --> 35:22.960
No.

35:22.960 --> 35:28.760
Let's see, a gentleman with the checkered, yes, yes, you holding your shirt.

35:28.760 --> 35:29.760
What's your name?

35:29.760 --> 35:30.760
Matt.

35:30.760 --> 35:31.760
Matt?

35:31.760 --> 35:32.760
Two T's.

35:32.760 --> 35:33.760
Matt?

35:33.760 --> 35:34.760
Matt.

35:34.760 --> 35:35.760
Oh, it's Matt.

35:35.760 --> 35:36.760
Like the actual name.

35:36.760 --> 35:37.760
Okay.

35:37.760 --> 35:38.760
Got it.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.760
Because Matt's isn't a name.

35:40.760 --> 35:41.760
Would you run up and join Spencer?

35:41.760 --> 35:42.760
Would you be Spencer's partner?

35:42.760 --> 35:52.760
Welcome to Guess the Sound Effect slash, I'm so sorry that your dad hit you.

35:52.760 --> 35:54.760
Okay.

35:54.760 --> 35:55.760
But he didn't really.

35:55.760 --> 36:01.760
I mean, I think they just probably smacked him in the butt when he touched a stove or

36:01.760 --> 36:02.760
something.

36:02.760 --> 36:03.760
That's the impression I'm getting.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.760
I was talking about your dad.

36:05.760 --> 36:06.760
Oh, my dad?

36:06.760 --> 36:07.760
Yeah.

36:07.760 --> 36:08.760
Yeah, he knocked me around bad.

36:08.760 --> 36:09.760
Okay.

36:09.760 --> 36:15.760
I was going to say, if your dad didn't hit you, why am I turned on by you all the time?

36:15.760 --> 36:18.760
All right, here we go, animal sound effects.

36:18.760 --> 36:27.760
And just to give you an example, this animal sound effect is called a dingo fight.

36:27.760 --> 36:28.760
Dingos.

36:28.760 --> 36:29.760
Fighters.

36:29.760 --> 36:34.760
Wait, where is that?

36:34.760 --> 36:35.760
Uh-oh.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.760
Oh, there it is.

36:38.760 --> 36:39.760
Dingos.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.760
Anyway, that's dingo fight.

36:42.760 --> 36:43.760
Okay.

36:43.760 --> 36:44.760
All right, okay.

36:44.760 --> 36:45.760
Here we go.

36:45.760 --> 36:51.760
So I'm going to play a sound effect and the team to get closest to it, the quickest,

36:51.760 --> 36:52.760
Quinn's.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.760
Don't know why I said it like that.

36:54.760 --> 36:55.760
It's fancy.

36:55.760 --> 37:00.760
I just, I made it like I was a Jewish man at a dolly for no reason.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.760
All right, here we go.

37:02.760 --> 37:03.760
Dingos.

37:03.760 --> 37:04.760
Right.

37:04.760 --> 37:05.760
Name an animal.

37:05.760 --> 37:06.760
The teapot bird.

37:06.760 --> 37:07.760
Sorry?

37:07.760 --> 37:08.760
It stands for the teapot bird.

37:08.760 --> 37:09.760
Teapot bird.

37:09.760 --> 37:16.760
Swarming, um, uh, June bugs.

37:16.760 --> 37:17.760
That's pretty close.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.760
It was Fly, Swarm, and Roebuck Bay, Australia.

37:20.760 --> 37:21.760
Very good.

37:21.760 --> 37:24.760
One point to audience.

37:24.760 --> 37:29.760
Okay, let's, let's play the two.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.760
All right, here we go.

37:31.760 --> 37:33.760
Question number two.

37:33.760 --> 37:40.760
Well, that's a horse, a capybara.

37:40.760 --> 37:41.760
Donkey.

37:41.760 --> 37:54.760
That is a brain donkey in Brazil with parents.

37:54.760 --> 37:55.760
All right.

37:55.760 --> 37:56.760
This is the tiebreaker.

37:56.760 --> 37:57.760
Here it comes.

37:57.760 --> 38:04.760
All right, Jeff, I know you're that you're listening to this podcast.

38:04.760 --> 38:08.760
We may edit this part out.

38:08.760 --> 38:13.760
I, I, I, as a rule, I edit all the stuff out that the audience is able to do in their car

38:13.760 --> 38:20.760
on the way here.

38:20.760 --> 38:21.760
Um, Jeff, I'll do better.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.760
It's going to get better.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.760
All right, here we go.

38:26.760 --> 38:27.760
Howler monkey.

38:27.760 --> 38:28.760
Nope.

38:28.760 --> 38:30.760
Uh, non-howler monkey.

38:30.760 --> 38:33.760
Bird, some kind of bird.

38:33.760 --> 38:34.760
Rhesus macaque.

38:34.760 --> 38:37.760
I know what that is.

38:37.760 --> 38:42.760
That's, that's, that's one of those little fuckers, a fox.

38:42.760 --> 38:44.760
Dingo's fighting again.

38:44.760 --> 38:45.760
A double weasel.

38:45.760 --> 38:46.760
Angry dog.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.760
You guys were close with Gibbon.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.760
Gibbon, Gibbon, it goes to the stage chief and they won the winner.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.760
It's okay.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.760
They did all right.

38:56.760 --> 38:57.760
Let's have a hand for Sam back there.

38:57.760 --> 39:00.760
And you win not having to talk to me about this bid after the show.

39:00.760 --> 39:03.760
That's not, you know, everyone's free to fail here at Harmontown.

39:03.760 --> 39:07.760
It's not, you're not supposed to come up with a game show on the fly.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.760
That's not your responsibility, baby.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.760
Baby, I love you.

39:12.760 --> 39:16.760
I love you too.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.760
Someone boo'd love.

39:18.760 --> 39:19.760
I heard one guy boo love.

39:19.760 --> 39:20.760
Who was it?

39:20.760 --> 39:23.760
All right, what's your name?

39:23.760 --> 39:24.760
Josh.

39:24.760 --> 39:25.760
Bring him up to the stage.

39:25.760 --> 39:26.760
Josh boo'd love.

39:26.760 --> 39:27.760
Come on up, Josh.

39:27.760 --> 39:28.760
Josh.

39:28.760 --> 39:34.760
I may be bad with sound effects, but I can fucking tuck lava all day.

39:34.760 --> 39:35.760
All right.

39:35.760 --> 39:36.760
Let's do it.

39:36.760 --> 39:39.760
Let's play a segment called Who Hurt You?

39:39.760 --> 39:41.760
It was Dan Harmon.

39:41.760 --> 39:47.760
Let's also play a segment called Know It None If Your Friends Would Hold Your T-shirt.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.760
I'm sorry I bought one.

39:49.760 --> 39:50.760
No, no, it's okay.

39:50.760 --> 39:51.760
I'm sorry, Josh?

39:51.760 --> 39:52.760
Yes, that's right.

39:52.760 --> 39:53.760
Yes, okay.

39:53.760 --> 39:54.760
All right, Josh.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.760
Let's do it.

39:55.760 --> 39:56.760
Jeff writes down everybody's name on a comment.

39:56.760 --> 39:57.760
Who hurt you, Josh?

39:57.760 --> 39:59.760
I don't think anybody did.

39:59.760 --> 40:00.760
Really?

40:00.760 --> 40:01.760
Yeah.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.760
Well, why boo love?

40:04.760 --> 40:06.760
Why not?

40:06.760 --> 40:10.760
Are you booing our love specifically, or just love in general?

40:10.760 --> 40:11.760
No, I don't know.

40:11.760 --> 40:14.760
Your love kind of destroyed an episode, kind of.

40:14.760 --> 40:19.760
A few nights ago.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.760
I love you guys, seriously.

40:21.760 --> 40:26.760
Were you bummed out that there was one less free episode that was funny?

40:26.760 --> 40:29.760
What are you having to do?

40:29.760 --> 40:31.760
It was just awkward.

40:31.760 --> 40:32.760
I agree.

40:32.760 --> 40:37.760
Well, is it more or less awkward than not communicating with people?

40:37.760 --> 40:40.760
Like, if we're like five questions deep into a conversation and every answer is,

40:40.760 --> 40:45.760
I don't know, or nothing, or a snarky comeback.

40:45.760 --> 40:49.760
Like, is that graceful or is that...

40:49.760 --> 40:50.760
You don't know.

40:50.760 --> 40:53.760
What's your point?

40:53.760 --> 40:58.760
I come from the mind space that it's better to go with the flow and kind of say what's

40:58.760 --> 40:59.760
on your mind.

40:59.760 --> 41:05.760
You can't tell me there's not one person in the history of your life that hurt you.

41:05.760 --> 41:06.760
Maybe.

41:06.760 --> 41:11.760
I feel like Josh might have a bigger issue with me.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.760
Oh, not at all.

41:13.760 --> 41:14.760
Oh, really?

41:14.760 --> 41:15.760
I think that's cool.

41:15.760 --> 41:18.760
I think you're projecting.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.760
No, come on.

41:20.760 --> 41:21.760
How many...

41:21.760 --> 41:23.760
I mean, I'm not even going to assume...

41:23.760 --> 41:25.760
You've had relationships, right?

41:25.760 --> 41:27.760
Yeah.

41:27.760 --> 41:30.760
Was there one that ended that you didn't want to end?

41:30.760 --> 41:32.760
I suppose that's probably true.

41:32.760 --> 41:33.760
Yeah.

41:33.760 --> 41:40.760
And when you did your podcast tour across the country...

41:40.760 --> 41:43.760
When there were stresses that arose.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.760
How did you feel about it?

41:45.760 --> 41:47.760
I love your podcast.

41:47.760 --> 41:50.760
The best cast?

41:50.760 --> 41:51.760
Great.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.760
This is going down a bad road.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.760
This is not a Harmontown.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.760
This is not a road to Harmontown.

41:58.760 --> 42:00.760
I'm celebrating as fast.

42:00.760 --> 42:01.760
He booed love.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.760
We brought him up.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.760
We're not going down his wardrobe.

42:06.760 --> 42:12.760
We want to get to know him, talk to him, try to break through to something human.

42:12.760 --> 42:15.760
I don't want to hug him.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.760
I think this is a nice thing to talk about.

42:18.760 --> 42:23.760
Josh, why do you feel our love ruined a podcast?

42:23.760 --> 42:27.760
The podcast was going and it was a lot of fun.

42:27.760 --> 42:33.760
Then it just kind of hit this weird train wreck.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.760
It's okay, guys.

42:35.760 --> 42:36.760
It's true.

42:36.760 --> 42:37.760
It's true.

42:37.760 --> 42:40.760
I'm just saying how I feel, man.

42:40.760 --> 42:41.760
I was kind of into it.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.760
I liked it, but I guess it was about me.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.760
I guess it was about someone else's relationship.

42:46.760 --> 42:48.760
I don't know.

42:48.760 --> 42:52.760
I can't really listen to it through anyone else's ears though.

42:52.760 --> 42:58.760
It's probably like a half hour longer than it needed to be in terms of talking about relationships.

42:58.760 --> 43:01.760
To be honest, I listened to the entire thing.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.760
It's not like I turned it off or anything.

43:03.760 --> 43:07.760
You were riveted.

43:07.760 --> 43:13.760
Well, I'm sorry for making the podcast not funny.

43:13.760 --> 43:15.760
Josh is mad at me, Dan.

43:15.760 --> 43:16.760
I'm telling you.

43:16.760 --> 43:17.760
He's mad at you?

43:17.760 --> 43:18.760
Yes, he is.

43:18.760 --> 43:19.760
It's okay.

43:19.760 --> 43:23.760
I'm the girlfriend who came on stage and was in a tizzy.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.760
As I explained in the Chicago podcast,

43:25.760 --> 43:28.760
I was upset about a previous fight and things.

43:28.760 --> 43:31.760
Can I walk you guys through an alternate scenario?

43:31.760 --> 43:35.760
Yes, yes, yes.

43:35.760 --> 43:38.760
Dan's in the crowd talking to people.

43:38.760 --> 43:40.760
Something happens about love.

43:40.760 --> 43:43.760
A bunch of people start cheering.

43:43.760 --> 43:45.760
Feeling the need to break the mold,

43:45.760 --> 43:49.760
he boos whatever reaction is being cheered.

43:49.760 --> 43:54.760
Called out by Dan, he acquiesce coming up on stage,

43:54.760 --> 43:57.760
proceeds to fail to answer the questions you want him to ask,

43:57.760 --> 43:59.760
and when he comes to a question he can ask,

43:59.760 --> 44:01.760
he answers in a way he hopes will be entertaining,

44:01.760 --> 44:04.760
and is then torn apart for it.

44:04.760 --> 44:12.760
The real star of the show, of course, is Spencer.

44:12.760 --> 44:15.760
I think we're all just raw and vulnerable up here, you guys.

44:15.760 --> 44:16.760
It's fine.

44:16.760 --> 44:18.760
Well, I know, and this isn't a dick,

44:18.760 --> 44:20.760
but I know that everything that you say up here,

44:20.760 --> 44:22.760
Josh, as you're speaking honestly about your feelings,

44:22.760 --> 44:25.760
you're going to make sure that it's hilarious.

44:25.760 --> 44:30.760
I like it when people laugh, yeah.

44:30.760 --> 44:35.760
I'm just kidding. I'm sorry for your bad podcast

44:35.760 --> 44:37.760
not being very funny.

44:37.760 --> 44:42.760
You already said that.

44:42.760 --> 44:45.760
In order for Josh to be mad at you,

44:45.760 --> 44:48.760
I think Josh would have to be in love with me.

44:48.760 --> 44:50.760
He's mad at our relationship.

44:50.760 --> 44:52.760
He doesn't think that it makes for entertaining.

44:52.760 --> 44:55.760
He was like, well, we're having fun in the Pittsburgh show,

44:55.760 --> 44:58.760
and then all of a sudden we're talking about things

44:58.760 --> 45:00.760
that are kind of common, probably,

45:00.760 --> 45:04.760
like the sound of a man and a woman going back and forth

45:04.760 --> 45:06.760
about who hurt who more and who needs to change

45:06.760 --> 45:08.760
and who doesn't need to change.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.760
For some people, it might be riveting,

45:10.760 --> 45:14.760
and for other people, inaccessible.

45:14.760 --> 45:16.760
Frigid.

45:16.760 --> 45:19.760
That was a dumb, obvious, easy joke.

45:19.760 --> 45:22.760
It's stupid.

45:22.760 --> 45:26.760
I think Spencer's theory is the most accurate.

45:26.760 --> 45:31.760
I think Josh is dressed perfectly.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.760
We're all good human beings.

45:33.760 --> 45:35.760
Aaron's doing a great job.

45:35.760 --> 45:37.760
I thought the Pittsburgh show was excellent.

45:37.760 --> 45:40.760
Unpredictable turns and all.

45:40.760 --> 45:42.760
I do what I say to Josh,

45:42.760 --> 45:44.760
and I said this in the Chicago show,

45:44.760 --> 45:47.760
but if there's any worry that Dan was going to censor himself

45:47.760 --> 45:51.760
because I talked about something that bummed me out,

45:51.760 --> 45:53.760
he definitely isn't.

45:53.760 --> 45:57.760
There's an understandable fear, and I'm sorry about that.

45:57.760 --> 45:59.760
That's all.

45:59.760 --> 46:03.760
Adventure.

46:03.760 --> 46:06.760
Alright, Josh, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for...

46:06.760 --> 46:09.760
Also, Matt, ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

46:09.760 --> 46:11.760
Poor Matt.

46:11.760 --> 46:15.760
Matt, come up here for a second.

46:15.760 --> 46:18.760
Yay, Matt!

46:18.760 --> 46:21.760
For you guys listening in the audience,

46:21.760 --> 46:26.760
Matt is the name of the guy that was on Spencer's team

46:26.760 --> 46:30.760
during a sound effect game show

46:30.760 --> 46:35.760
that may or may not be in the edited show you're listening to.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.760
He was put on a team with Spencer

46:37.760 --> 46:42.760
and has been standing behind me next to Spencer

46:42.760 --> 46:45.760
just kind of hanging out this entire time.

46:45.760 --> 46:47.760
He guessed the donkey, yeah.

46:47.760 --> 46:49.760
Great seat, though.

46:49.760 --> 46:53.760
But it's hard to tell if we edit out Josh or the audio game show

46:53.760 --> 46:57.760
or we don't know what will be frog DNA

46:57.760 --> 46:59.760
and what will be dinosaur DNA.

46:59.760 --> 47:01.760
We're after the show.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.760
Well, it just seemed like no one was controlling.

47:03.760 --> 47:04.760
Right, right.

47:04.760 --> 47:05.760
Or there was no show.

47:05.760 --> 47:10.760
Ladies and gentlemen, goodnight!

47:10.760 --> 47:12.760
Gong.

47:12.760 --> 47:16.760
Matt, I think you've paid your dues.

47:16.760 --> 47:19.760
Let's get to know you and touch your heart.

47:19.760 --> 47:20.760
We do.

47:20.760 --> 47:22.760
Are you from Minneapolis?

47:22.760 --> 47:23.760
I am from Minneapolis.

47:23.760 --> 47:24.760
What do you do here?

47:24.760 --> 47:25.760
I'm a writer.

47:25.760 --> 47:26.760
You're a writer?

47:26.760 --> 47:27.760
Oh, wow. What kind of writer?

47:27.760 --> 47:28.760
Corporate writer.

47:28.760 --> 47:29.760
Oh, what is that?

47:29.760 --> 47:30.760
You're specific.

47:30.760 --> 47:31.760
What is that?

47:31.760 --> 47:32.760
What does that entail?

47:32.760 --> 47:34.760
Business writer, advertising, that kind of thing.

47:34.760 --> 47:36.760
Like a gun for hire or you work for a company?

47:36.760 --> 47:37.760
I work for a company.

47:37.760 --> 47:38.760
Can you say which one?

47:38.760 --> 47:39.760
I can't, unfortunately.

47:39.760 --> 47:40.760
Microsoft?

47:40.760 --> 47:42.760
There we go.

47:42.760 --> 47:43.760
What?

47:43.760 --> 47:45.760
My fiance just said CIA, so.

47:45.760 --> 47:46.760
What?

47:46.760 --> 47:47.760
No, not really.

47:47.760 --> 47:48.760
Shut up.

47:48.760 --> 47:49.760
Yeah.

47:49.760 --> 47:50.760
No.

47:50.760 --> 47:59.760
If someone says they can't say what they work for and then they go, CIA, it could be

47:59.760 --> 48:00.760
true.

48:00.760 --> 48:01.760
I don't know.

48:01.760 --> 48:03.760
I hate to be so secretive.

48:03.760 --> 48:07.760
No, you just don't want to, it's McDonald's or something and you don't want to be on a

48:07.760 --> 48:08.760
podcast saying.

48:08.760 --> 48:09.760
I want to still be employed.

48:09.760 --> 48:10.760
Yeah, exactly.

48:10.760 --> 48:13.760
Yeah, we did a show in Chicago and I was kind of like, oh, I just started talking about

48:13.760 --> 48:15.760
people I'm working for.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.760
That hasn't podcast yet, but I cringe a little bit when I hear it.

48:18.760 --> 48:20.760
It's awesome though, so it has to go out there.

48:20.760 --> 48:24.760
But unlike you, I make my living getting fired.

48:24.760 --> 48:30.760
That is my livelihood in a roundabout way.

48:30.760 --> 48:39.760
I'm like a weird kind of frog with an ass for a head that jumps.

48:39.760 --> 48:42.760
Wow, the sound of a frog.

48:42.760 --> 48:50.760
All right, Matt, Matt, what's your favorite, favorite movie?

48:50.760 --> 48:52.760
I mean, a favorite movie.

48:52.760 --> 48:54.760
I hate it when people ask that too.

48:54.760 --> 48:57.760
Okay, a favorite movie, A Serious Man.

48:57.760 --> 48:58.760
A Serious Man.

48:58.760 --> 49:00.760
Oh, that is a great movie.

49:00.760 --> 49:01.760
Yeah.

49:01.760 --> 49:03.760
That's a really underrated, wonderful movie.

49:03.760 --> 49:05.760
Which red owl played a part in?

49:05.760 --> 49:07.760
Red owl played a part in.

49:07.760 --> 49:08.760
Whoa.

49:08.760 --> 49:15.760
Okay, now we got to know, okay, who said fuck you really angrily to what?

49:15.760 --> 49:17.760
A silly man said fuck you.

49:17.760 --> 49:21.760
I mean, please come up.

49:21.760 --> 49:26.760
Like, I mean, I'm going to make this assumption about a Harmontown audience.

49:26.760 --> 49:30.760
Even though on paper, someone yelling out fuck you.

49:30.760 --> 49:32.760
Come over here, sir.

49:32.760 --> 49:37.760
Shouldn't be rewarded in maybe a regular show, but usually people here have something on their mind.

49:37.760 --> 49:38.760
What's your name?

49:38.760 --> 49:39.760
My name's Joe.

49:39.760 --> 49:40.760
Hi, Joe.

49:40.760 --> 49:41.760
How are you doing?

49:41.760 --> 49:42.760
I'm doing okay.

49:42.760 --> 49:45.760
Joe, explain the reaction.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.760
Thank you for welcoming me to Harmontown.

49:47.760 --> 49:50.760
Oh, no problem.

49:50.760 --> 49:53.760
Comptrolling disaster.

49:53.760 --> 49:55.760
Spencer, nearly.

49:55.760 --> 49:56.760
All right, I got it.

49:56.760 --> 49:57.760
Okay.

49:57.760 --> 49:58.760
Me versus the microphone.

49:58.760 --> 50:01.760
They just fixed the microphone for the podcast listeners.

50:01.760 --> 50:02.760
We got it.

50:02.760 --> 50:04.760
I feel important now.

50:04.760 --> 50:06.760
It's about backstage, so what are we doing?

50:06.760 --> 50:11.760
Joe, you're going to tell people why you yelled fuck you out.

50:11.760 --> 50:14.760
What were you yelling fuck you in response to?

50:14.760 --> 50:15.760
Honestly.

50:15.760 --> 50:16.760
No, not honestly.

50:16.760 --> 50:17.760
Lie to us.

50:17.760 --> 50:19.760
Huh, this guy, right, guys?

50:19.760 --> 50:20.760
Yes.

50:20.760 --> 50:23.760
At least you're gone, honestly.

50:23.760 --> 50:26.760
It was strictly to get on stage.

50:26.760 --> 50:28.760
So you were really saying fuck you?

50:28.760 --> 50:29.760
Right.

50:29.760 --> 50:34.760
You're kind of giving me better minds a little bit.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.760
Okay, so this is an interesting phenomenon here.

50:36.760 --> 50:37.760
I want to...

50:37.760 --> 50:38.760
I'm sorry, Dan.

50:38.760 --> 50:39.760
I want to...

50:39.760 --> 50:40.760
Everyone shut up and press...

50:40.760 --> 50:41.760
I'm going to press pause here for a second,

50:41.760 --> 50:44.760
because this is a very, very interesting thing that's happening here

50:44.760 --> 50:47.760
for the second time in a row.

50:47.760 --> 50:50.760
We finally hit this point.

50:50.760 --> 50:54.760
In Harmontown, people who say things in the audience

50:54.760 --> 50:56.760
and how they're compelled to say things,

50:56.760 --> 50:58.760
they get to come up on stage and we talk to them

50:58.760 --> 51:00.760
until we get to know them.

51:00.760 --> 51:03.760
And now we've reached this point where that's the second guy

51:03.760 --> 51:06.760
who just, like Spencer said,

51:06.760 --> 51:09.760
someone wants to be different from the pack.

51:09.760 --> 51:11.760
They're specifically saying things

51:11.760 --> 51:13.760
so that they can come up on stage,

51:13.760 --> 51:16.760
and at which point we're ringing a dry rag.

51:16.760 --> 51:17.760
We're just talking to a person,

51:17.760 --> 51:18.760
hey, what do you want?

51:18.760 --> 51:21.760
We're gonna think, to be on stage,

51:21.760 --> 51:24.760
to have my name exist,

51:24.760 --> 51:26.760
to stand.

51:26.760 --> 51:27.760
Is that totally true?

51:27.760 --> 51:29.760
We were really saying that.

51:29.760 --> 51:32.760
I am not a dry rag.

51:32.760 --> 51:35.760
Okay, that was dehumanizing, I apologize.

51:35.760 --> 51:38.760
But your motivation was not,

51:38.760 --> 51:39.760
you didn't want to come up and talk about

51:39.760 --> 51:42.760
a serious man being his favorite movie.

51:42.760 --> 51:43.760
Not at all.

51:43.760 --> 51:45.760
You said, fuck you.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.760
For the same reason that Josh booed Love,

51:47.760 --> 51:48.760
you said, fuck you.

51:48.760 --> 51:51.760
No, no, fuck Josh for booing Love.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.760
Yeah, you're changing your story.

51:53.760 --> 51:55.760
It's not all a tack, Josh.

51:55.760 --> 52:00.760
All right, all right, you sit down.

52:00.760 --> 52:02.760
I'll go sit down.

52:02.760 --> 52:04.760
Thank you for coming up here.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.760
Tonight it may be in further shows,

52:06.760 --> 52:08.760
instead of yelling something like, fuck you,

52:08.760 --> 52:10.760
maybe say like, bananas in my pants,

52:10.760 --> 52:12.760
or something obscure.

52:12.760 --> 52:15.760
All right, bananas in my pants guy, come up here, come up here.

52:15.760 --> 52:19.760
All right, all right.

52:19.760 --> 52:23.760
Come over this way.

52:23.760 --> 52:25.760
I thought like a dozen people would say it

52:25.760 --> 52:26.760
like at the same time.

52:26.760 --> 52:28.760
Okay, all right, all right, that was a misfire.

52:28.760 --> 52:30.760
Okay, okay.

52:30.760 --> 52:31.760
So you're a team player.

52:31.760 --> 52:32.760
What's your name, fella?

52:32.760 --> 52:33.760
My name is Jaffer.

52:33.760 --> 52:34.760
It's okay if you don't get it.

52:34.760 --> 52:35.760
Jaffer?

52:35.760 --> 52:36.760
No, you got it on the first try.

52:36.760 --> 52:37.760
That's awesome.

52:37.760 --> 52:40.760
All right, like an exotic Jaffer.

52:40.760 --> 52:41.760
Yeah, sort of, yeah.

52:41.760 --> 52:45.760
I apply tape to things in an exotic way,

52:45.760 --> 52:46.760
an exotic brown-skinned way.

52:46.760 --> 52:47.760
Thank you.

52:47.760 --> 52:50.760
What do you do, Jaffer?

52:50.760 --> 52:52.760
Oh, well, I gave Spencer my card.

52:52.760 --> 52:54.760
I'm the event coordinator for Fantasy Flight Games,

52:54.760 --> 52:58.760
and I gave Fantasy...

52:58.760 --> 53:00.760
Is that like, claims that have jungles on them?

53:00.760 --> 53:01.760
What is that?

53:01.760 --> 53:02.760
What is Fantasy Flight?

53:02.760 --> 53:05.760
Oh, Fantasy Flight Games is a hobby game company.

53:05.760 --> 53:07.760
We are located in Rosewood.

53:07.760 --> 53:09.760
This is so, it's like sales tax.

53:09.760 --> 53:11.760
Well, no, I mean, this is...

53:11.760 --> 53:13.760
Are they electronic games?

53:13.760 --> 53:14.760
This is your crowd.

53:14.760 --> 53:15.760
No, no, we're table top.

53:15.760 --> 53:16.760
Oh, really?

53:16.760 --> 53:17.760
Oh, cool.

53:17.760 --> 53:21.760
I love games.

53:21.760 --> 53:24.760
Oh, this is so weird.

53:24.760 --> 53:25.760
I didn't...

53:25.760 --> 53:26.760
I really didn't expect this to happen.

53:26.760 --> 53:29.760
He just thought everyone would go bananas on.

53:29.760 --> 53:30.760
All right.

53:30.760 --> 53:31.760
That's why you're a hero.

53:31.760 --> 53:32.760
It's fine.

53:32.760 --> 53:33.760
All right.

53:33.760 --> 53:34.760
He already got his plug.

53:34.760 --> 53:35.760
It's the name of his star.

53:35.760 --> 53:36.760
If you're in Minneapolis and you...

53:36.760 --> 53:37.760
No, we're a publisher.

53:37.760 --> 53:38.760
We publish games.

53:38.760 --> 53:39.760
All right.

53:39.760 --> 53:40.760
God damn it.

53:40.760 --> 53:41.760
Jaffer, everybody.

53:41.760 --> 53:42.760
Thank you, Jaffer.

53:42.760 --> 53:44.760
Jaffer loves bananas in his pants.

53:44.760 --> 53:45.760
All right.

53:45.760 --> 53:46.760
All right.

53:46.760 --> 53:50.760
Matt, we were talking about your favorite movie.

53:50.760 --> 53:51.760
Yeah.

53:51.760 --> 53:52.760
Come on, Matt.

53:52.760 --> 53:53.760
Come on, Matt.

53:53.760 --> 53:54.760
All right.

53:54.760 --> 53:55.760
Let's hear it for Matt.

53:55.760 --> 53:57.760
Also, ladies and gentlemen, he loves a simple...

53:57.760 --> 54:00.760
A simple man.

54:00.760 --> 54:02.760
All right.

54:02.760 --> 54:03.760
Okay.

54:03.760 --> 54:12.760
Well, not a good idea to work the crowd.

54:12.760 --> 54:14.760
A little bit of a mistake.

54:14.760 --> 54:15.760
No.

54:15.760 --> 54:16.760
Fuck you.

54:16.760 --> 54:17.760
Fuck you.

54:17.760 --> 54:20.760
No more.

54:20.760 --> 54:23.760
No more Q&A.

54:23.760 --> 54:36.760
You know, there's a time during every Harmon show where the end of my nose starts to tingle

54:36.760 --> 54:37.760
and my...

54:37.760 --> 54:39.760
Oh, I think you have to go back to the powder room.

54:39.760 --> 54:40.760
No.

54:40.760 --> 54:41.760
No.

54:41.760 --> 54:42.760
No.

54:42.760 --> 54:45.760
My lips start to plump and I start feeling stronger.

54:45.760 --> 54:50.760
And it's D&D time.

54:50.760 --> 54:57.760
Should I pass out the characters?

54:57.760 --> 54:58.760
Yes, please.

54:58.760 --> 55:00.760
Dispense the characters, Betsy.

55:00.760 --> 55:01.760
All right.

55:01.760 --> 55:03.760
Then be entertaining.

55:03.760 --> 55:06.760
Hey, everybody.

55:06.760 --> 55:10.760
This really is a wonderful city and a cool space.

55:10.760 --> 55:12.760
So you got the idea.

55:12.760 --> 55:15.760
I hated the guy with the UTV pat of friends.

55:15.760 --> 55:16.760
It's cool.

55:16.760 --> 55:17.760
I don't know.

55:17.760 --> 55:19.760
Oh, just saying hello.

55:19.760 --> 55:20.760
Stay where you are.

55:20.760 --> 55:23.760
We'll talk after.

55:23.760 --> 55:24.760
I screwed up this music.

55:24.760 --> 55:25.760
I'm sorry.

55:25.760 --> 55:26.760
I'll do it over again for...

55:26.760 --> 55:27.760
What's the other...

55:27.760 --> 55:28.760
What's the other...

55:28.760 --> 55:29.760
What's the other...

55:29.760 --> 55:32.760
The Twin Cities is the Saint Paul, yeah.

55:32.760 --> 55:34.760
You guys all know Garrison Keeler?

55:34.760 --> 55:35.760
No.

55:35.760 --> 55:36.760
Is that a hat?

55:36.760 --> 55:37.760
No.

55:37.760 --> 55:38.760
So you hate Garrison Keeler?

55:38.760 --> 55:39.760
Yes.

55:39.760 --> 55:40.760
Fuck that guy.

55:40.760 --> 55:47.760
Who hates Garrison Keeler?

55:47.760 --> 55:48.760
You...

55:48.760 --> 55:49.760
Why do you...

55:49.760 --> 55:50.760
What's your name?

55:50.760 --> 55:51.760
He talks too slow.

55:51.760 --> 55:53.760
He talks too slow?

55:53.760 --> 55:56.760
Is that your only reason for disliking him?

55:56.760 --> 55:59.760
Does anyone have a better reason for disliking Garrison Keeler?

55:59.760 --> 56:00.760
Yes.

56:00.760 --> 56:01.760
Because they were joking.

56:01.760 --> 56:02.760
It's just reality.

56:02.760 --> 56:03.760
Right.

56:03.760 --> 56:04.760
You're not funny.

56:04.760 --> 56:05.760
It's just Minnesota.

56:05.760 --> 56:06.760
Right.

56:06.760 --> 56:07.760
What?

56:07.760 --> 56:08.760
Minnesota.

56:08.760 --> 56:10.760
Yeah.

56:10.760 --> 56:11.760
Yeah.

56:11.760 --> 56:13.760
That is a little annoying.

56:13.760 --> 56:14.760
She said he sings.

56:14.760 --> 56:15.760
That's true.

56:15.760 --> 56:16.760
He puts himself on everything.

56:16.760 --> 56:17.760
Yeah.

56:17.760 --> 56:18.760
It's his fucking show.

56:18.760 --> 56:19.760
Yeah, it is.

56:19.760 --> 56:20.760
It's his show.

56:20.760 --> 56:26.760
He says Arthur Keeler in the background.

56:26.760 --> 56:38.560
If you've just joined us, Aaron asked, do you guys like Garrison Keeler to 225-year-olds

56:38.560 --> 56:40.560
who shockingly replied, no.

56:40.560 --> 56:41.560
There was a...

56:41.560 --> 56:42.560
There was a mixed reaction.

56:42.560 --> 56:48.880
The answer to the question, why not, is he's 109 years old.

56:48.880 --> 56:51.560
His show is 70 hours long.

56:51.560 --> 56:56.560
He sings and talks about being in a city.

56:56.560 --> 57:01.800
He's the Dan Harmon of the future.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.800
But then everyone started yelling at each other.

57:03.800 --> 57:04.800
Then one guy...

57:04.800 --> 57:08.440
I'm relaying this to the podcast people because no one can hear people in the audience.

57:08.440 --> 57:12.960
Then another guy said, it's his fucking show about Garrison Keeler.

57:12.960 --> 57:16.720
You're kind of a punk rock guy sticking up for Garrison Keeler.

57:16.720 --> 57:20.880
And then people are going back and forth.

57:20.880 --> 57:23.760
Now you're all caught up if you're listening to this in podcast form.

57:23.760 --> 57:25.760
I like that guy.

57:25.760 --> 57:29.760
He likes rhubarb pie and powder milk biscuit.

57:29.760 --> 57:32.760
Rhubarb pie.

57:32.760 --> 57:40.760
Dan, can you do a monologue as Garrison Keeler about your day?

57:40.760 --> 57:41.760
About...

57:41.760 --> 57:45.760
I'd like to do it about rhubarb pie.

57:45.760 --> 57:51.760
Are you going to give Jimmy your dog pomera Jimmy shirt right now?

57:51.760 --> 58:01.760
I woke up this morning in Lake Wobegon with tremendous erection.

58:01.760 --> 58:10.760
You're a bane from Batman.

58:10.760 --> 58:11.760
Just go with it.

58:11.760 --> 58:14.760
Be bane as Garrison Keeler as you.

58:14.760 --> 58:22.760
My cock Batman is stronger than your body.

58:22.760 --> 58:26.760
All right, very good.

58:26.760 --> 58:28.760
Let's do some D&D.

58:28.760 --> 58:48.760
The weather in Lake Wobegon, Gotham, Lake Gotham, the people will no longer stand for rhubarb pie.

58:48.760 --> 59:08.760
Margaret made her famous fruit cake and brought it over to the Jacobson's house for what promise to be a perfectly ordinary Thanksgiving.

59:08.760 --> 59:24.760
The embers were warm, the crime was rampant, and the justice was ultimately mine.

59:24.760 --> 59:26.760
All right.

59:26.760 --> 59:28.760
Batman.

59:28.760 --> 59:30.760
D&D and Herman, everybody.

59:30.760 --> 59:47.760
This is from Lake Gotham, where the children are victims, the poor are enslaved, and everyone's spirit will be broken.

59:47.760 --> 59:48.760
There we go.

59:48.760 --> 59:50.760
That was great.

59:54.760 --> 59:56.760
D&D transitions.

59:56.760 --> 01:00:01.760
Yeah, tell us what happened to catch us up in D&D land.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:10.760
When we last met our heroes deep within the Infinifish, we're journeying with Vallas and the swordsmen into the digestive tract of the beast.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:16.760
After defeating a mysterious eye-stalk monster, the group split up, each traveling down a different passage.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:22.760
Mulraine fell down a slippery slide while Quark found a strange port in hanging from the ceiling.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:30.760
Using the mysterious silver staff, Sharpie climbed up into a lattice of veins and tubules before finding a mysterious, membranous wall.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:35.760
Quark and Mulraine caught back up with Sharpie, and together the group entered the large organ.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:43.760
Immediately, a blob of sickly yellow ooze dripped down, and several lightning spiders skittered into the organ from above.

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.760
It was time to fight.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.760
That's everybody.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:57.760
All right, let's dramatically, let me step the stage, you guys, it just slashed through the wall of a giant organ and climbed inside,

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:07.760
and a large blob of goo dropped down from the ceiling, and it was followed by sparks of light that kind of skittered around as if they had spidery limbs.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.760
Right, right.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.760
So, in this episode, do we pretend Jeff wasn't there?

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:19.760
For the purposes of this episode, Quark will be played by Spencer Crittenden.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:23.760
Yeah!

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.760
Thanks, guys.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.760
Quark's going to like Mulraine in this episode.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.760
Who knows what's going to happen?

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.760
Let's work together.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.760
Take notes, man.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.760
The Dungeon Masters find a character.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:40.760
Spencer, let's glue our arms together for life so when Jeff comes back, we're one being.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.760
Just an idea.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.760
That's a good plan.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.760
All right, so these are spider creatures?

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.760
There's spider lightning creatures in a multi-limbed blob on the ground.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.760
Multi-limbed blob, spider, lightning spider creatures.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.760
It sounds like a day at the office.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:04.760
Oh.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.760
Festival.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:12.760
I just tasted what Rob Schneider had for lunch last Wednesday.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:17.760
Spencer, are the lightning spiders trying to attack us?

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:23.760
As it happens, the lightning spiders are crawling over the cut that you slashed in the wall.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.760
They're sewing it back together.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:32.760
The slimy blob whips around a tendular too and goo is cast all about the organ.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.760
It seems like it's going to be hard to move about.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.760
Well, I appreciate the craftiness.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.760
Yeah, because the goo is sticky?

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:45.760
You haven't touched it, but goo tends to be.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.760
You haven't met my goo.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.760
Oh, damn.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.760
Smooth as silk.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:00.760
Slippery is a baby in January.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.760
Two years blueberry bubblegum.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:11.760
And there's no way we're getting out of this room without either retreating,

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.760
which doesn't even seem possible because the hole is being sewed up,

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.760
or confronting this thing.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.760
We're not able to be the coward that I'd like to be.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.760
Correct.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.760
To the lightning creatures approach.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.760
I shoot two arrows.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.760
What kind of arrows?

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.760
Adventure arrows?

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.760
No, you have the special kind that are good for shooting regular arrows,

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.760
good arrows, sleep arrows, V arrows.

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.760
Does good just mean good skill?

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.760
It does extra damage against evil creatures.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.760
Two good arrows.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.760
What was that, Sharpie?

01:03:54.760 --> 01:04:00.760
I remember him telling you there was a type of arrow you had that was optimized for multiple arrow shooting.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.760
Yeah, isn't it true?

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.760
It's true.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.760
I already rolled the dice.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.760
V arrows?

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.760
One of your good arrows strikes the lightning directly in the center of mass.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.760
It does six damage.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:20.760
Spencer, are my double arrows the V arrows?

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.760
Yeah, V arrows.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.760
Okay, cool.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.760
What about her second arrow?

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.760
I got a bad feeling about this.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.760
I just missed.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.760
It didn't go into anything comically.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.760
It went to heaven. God ate it.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.760
All right.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.760
No, sir, I have to warn you.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.760
I don't know if you heard the Brooklyn show,

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.760
but after giving Ray of Frost its own theme song,

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.760
we found out it is a level zero spell that does a maximum of three damage.

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:57.760
We're going to need to start getting enthusiastic about what I'm told is my most powerful spell.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.760
Scorching Ray!

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.760
Scorching Ray!

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:11.760
Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw Draw

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.760

Hit the...

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.760
Hit the...

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.760
Scorching Ray doing a fearn from the fuckers!

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.760
Fuck your mama.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.760
Okay

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:36.120
Who do you fire it at there's the slime blob and some lightning things? Oh, oh, I'm scorch

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:43.300
I'm scorching ray at the at the tentacle that's making the goo sounds good. You strike it dealing some amount of damage

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:57.300
Nineteen damage

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:10.540
A shell I say he's something racist Indian people what's wrong with them? Oh shit. I lost it again

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.540
All right

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:27.340
An acropolis

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:29.980

Just ran out into the audience and high-fived everyone down and out into the audience

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:58.260
Giving salutations and greetings with his physical hand

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.860
To the populace of Lake Wobegon

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:04.900
The pies were cooling

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:10.460
The mashed potatoes were ripe and the cranberries were

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.220
Cran

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.380
batman

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.700
Sorry scorching ray 19 damage. I got a little

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:25.580
Quark pipes up. Hey guys

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:33.100
I I I licked I licked vodka out of my own mustache and a guy in the front row went. Oh, I

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.820
Never I never had

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:40.460
First of all, I did it because I was excited second of all. He was delicious

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:45.900
So I had that double pleasure and then but then a third of my brain was became excited

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:48.820
He has a liquor on facial hair it reminded me of like the playground

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:54.220
I found out like like like or in the bathroom at the in grade school when I when all the kids started laughing at me at the

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:58.740
Urinal because I I didn't know until sixth grade that you're not when you pee at a urinal

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:02.060
You're not supposed to pull your underwear and pants all the way down to your ankles

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.620
And pee like a little a little cartoon

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:17.700
Sorry Spencer quark pipes up. Hey guys. Well, I have a good frog in my throat, but I'm ready to fight

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:20.260
I'm a barbarian. I fight things. Yeah

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:24.180
I I I I I I tell quark to go into

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:29.460
A kind of Zen state where the universe

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:38.260
Aka the dungeon master kind of optimizes his his behavior his choices. I don't know about that

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.660
I thought I might just go into a barbarian rage

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:48.900
But first you gotta if something happens to me you gotta you gotta take my smokesticks

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:54.900
I'm trying to quit but here will grab your smokesticks grabbing his smokestips

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.340
He whips out his sword

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:02.360
His muscles rise and grow en masse as he falls into the barbarian rage

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:10.020
Red goes over his eyes as all semblance of reason exits his head and he charges himself directly at the slime monster

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:18.020
And he misses

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:20.820
Sharpie

01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:28.860
Yes, I know this might be dangerous, but I have a few I have 20, but I can only shoot two at a time

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:32.220
I have the arrows. Yeah. Yeah, those are optimized for shooting well

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:42.380
More than what I shoot to vagina arrows

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:51.900
Which means that they're complicated smooth and pink

01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.940
And they have teeth, right

01:09:55.940 --> 01:10:05.340
Your arrows fail to hit their mark they plant harmlessly in the side of the membrane

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:08.420
Well, it's still cute. It's still cute with it arguable

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:15.620
One of the lightning creatures approaches and jumps directly on a Sharpie's face

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:19.420
No, you take six damage and you have a thing on your face

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:27.300
That's a secondary effect. Yep. I only have 24 hit points total was I at full health before this fight started?

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:32.620
Yeah, you you got some of those crystals from the broken healing pendant. So you guys are all at full health

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:38.500
What do I get an animal? I want to say fourth level maybe fifth

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.700
So today we

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:47.260
Know

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:55.500
Well utilize the powers of the secret and just say I'd like to get this thing off my face. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.340
Take a single

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:06.660
Sure shot arrow. Oh, okay. Is that a thing? Did I write that? Oh, yeah

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:14.220
It says always hits every time and I'm my name is Spencer and I'm gonna give you a spirit animal

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:19.220
Awesome, you fire the arrow directly into your foot

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:27.420
Okay, all right, I shoot it. I shoot a good error. Did you really have an error? That's a sure shot. No

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:32.500
Aaron Aaron, I know these things

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.060
To make up an error

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.140
Boy, oh Aaron I

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:51.020
Shoot a baby arrow into Sharpie's heart

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:58.260
I shoot a good okay, I shoot a good arrow

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:04.640
Okay, and I shoot it good at his face. No, I shoot it at the spider on his face

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.200
Well, if it's on his face right now, then yes. Yeah, but there's also other spiders

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.800
So I mean well the one the one that is is most threatening Sharpie. So the one on his face

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.440
I'm just this is clarification is important

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.840
Yes, the one on his face unless there's another one that's threatening him more. Nope

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.640
Pulling an arrow from your quiver you lose it directly at his face

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:33.360
You seem to think this might not be the best of ideas

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.320
This was your idea

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:44.320
Couldn't have been more elucidated like in that you guys had a 10-minute conversation about whether you're gonna shoot me the fucking face

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:54.840
It strikes the lightning spider in one of his several spidery limbs he takes

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.880
five damage

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:04.960
At least that's something I didn't hate you in the face wounded the animal skitters away

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:12.960
Oh you doubters Charles Burroughs, what was his name?

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.560
The slime whips a wicked tendril directly at mull rain

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:26.280
It strikes you right in the leg and grasps you feel the burn of acid against your flesh and you take a damage

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.400
Guess I deserve this

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.240
You're also being grappled. Oh

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.600
That means stuff

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:42.960
What that means stuff, but I mean, yeah like rules-wise, but don't worry about it

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.920
I can't I can't I

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:56.200
Can't I keep forgetting what Mage Hand is I can I it lets you telekinetically move around light objects

01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:01.680
Yeah, yeah, right across sir. Come on. You're you're good. I mean, why don't you marry it?

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.960
It's it's a it is a maximum three hit point damage spell. It is

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.120
It's scorching ray sir

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:23.220
I'd like to implore anyone either named Ray Frost or from a town called Frost named ray

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:28.020
To come to the podcast because you'll be there will be a crowd on your head

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:33.100
If there was a spell called scorching frost, don't you think that the net effect of it would be minimal?

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.940
Scorching scorching frost is a glass of water. I

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:47.780
Want to cast burning hands if it's my turn on on the grappling tentacle to try to get it to release its grip from my

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.500
face-shooting girlfriend

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:54.900
Fanning your hands wide you've emit a thin flame sheet

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:03.460
It deals nine damage slices the tentacle in half

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:12.100
Well, he don't know when he slacks the tentacle

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:20.940
Attack that was that was quark attacking in a rage. Oh nice. I thought that was the tentacle

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:24.100
No, I was just having an episode you guys

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.540
He critically hits

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:31.900
We call that the Mitch Hurwitz

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:40.300
Dealing 22 damage and felling the slime only four lightning spiders remain

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.380
All right, they scuttle to the ceiling

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:50.780
Well, all right. Well, it sounds like they're getting out of our way. Well, they they are they're out of your way now

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:56.220
Now you're in an organ so the tent so the tentacle thing is done the tentacle things done spiders on the ceiling

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:59.780
They're they're just kind of watching at this point. All right, well

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.700
We should get out of this out of this room

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:06.300
It's a lung. It's a lung

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:09.260
Yeah, someone's been paying attention

01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:17.980
Prince Vellison pipes up. Hey guys, we came around to destroy this fish from the inside. Yeah, yeah

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:21.160
So do you want to destroy it from the inside?

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:26.600
I'm saying let's slice this mother

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:36.440
Also somebody somebody in the audience yelled out smoke sticks if we're if we're if we're sitting in the lung like like let's let's

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.440
Yule Brenner this motherfucker

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:43.760
It's almost as if I set you up for it all along. I know well then you said slices

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.760
throwing the pack of smoke sticks on the ground and I

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:54.760
We do that and then I also light on my torches lighting your torches in unison with the throwing of the smoke sticks

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:59.600
Acrid smoke is released into the lung. You hear violent spasms

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.680
for a while

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:09.140
We should we should maybe I don't know if I don't know if there are jobs that get out of here or stay and be coughed up or

01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:16.740
Let's see next time cliffhanger. Okay, fine. Yeah, good idea. All right Spencer ladies and gentlemen

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.300
Gathering his character sheets

01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:31.540
The viking like figure in his red tartan

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.300
sweat jacket

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:40.300
Proceeds off the stage and into the 20 below weather wearing his shorts from Los Angeles

01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:43.740
You don't know if he'll live or die

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:49.540
His beard seems scarf like but will it save him from hypothermia?

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:54.100
He's entitled to a save versus

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.100
We're working out the case

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:05.940
Do you want me to leave the stage? Oh, no, no, you don't have to just just make it sure

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:11.020
I never want you to leave the stage. Thanks. You guys. I want not only do I not want you to leave the stage

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.020
I want you to get into my bed

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:20.620
For the podcast listeners, there is a very expensive heart shaped bed raising on a platform right now

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:23.740
with pyrotechnics going off all around it and

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:28.580
Isaac Hayes is playing a keyboard in the corner. You just put it on you

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:30.580

Rolled her pussy die got a three and a four added it up. I got a bonus and more with my purple dick

She was a skull and bones. I fucked your mama so hard. She said don't leave me alone

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:09.860
Spencer's daddy came in said what's going on. I said, holy shit

But you're like Gary Bussey

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.940
Turn that frown upside down

01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:10.900
Truth

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:17.780
I'm working the crowd. What's your name? Peter Peter. I fucked your mama in this theater

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:23.860
I fucked her I fucked her right on this floor. There's a red rug here, but it's gonna get red some more

Because I gave her menstruation fuck your mama all across this great motherfucking nation fuck fuck her in Canada, too

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:37.340
It counts in Toronto. I fucked your mama like lone Ranger fuck tonneau. I fucked your mama Prano

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:42.780
I did it right split. I fucked your mama that I gave her a little tip a bonus one

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:48.040
So now she's got three a bunch of mama that I poured her a cup of lemonade sight P

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.540
I made her drink my pee

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:05.620
Lights above me like stars tweaking bright. I fucked your mama like Muhammad Ali didn't fight

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:09.820
I wrote my doctor ass with my big dick put her on the ropes

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:18.580
Made her sick she puked out my penis and then I I've gathered it up and I took it and put it in a chocolate like slob

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:27.780
It's a form of slop if you're a real farmer, you know, it's terminology that you know, let me let me let me let me clarify

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:33.280
ым rhythm

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.720
I

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.740
Bratly toddler dance in the aisle

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:50.740
A rap band, a rap band, a rap band

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:53.740
Look at this being very soft when like he's a baby

01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:55.740
Put your momma's pussy in a treasure chest

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:58.740
Put my dick between a big motherfucking breast

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:01.740
Took her outside where it's cold as hell

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:04.740
I fucked your momma in the cold so she couldn't even tell

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:06.740
Cause her pussy was numb from the cold

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:08.740
What I'm told in Minneapolis

01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:10.740
That fucking weather is bold

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.740
She got an icicle instead of my wiener

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.740
I fucked your momma

01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.740
It was cleaner the first time

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:20.740
When I did it a year ago

01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:22.740
Then I did it this time

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:23.740
It seemed dirtier bro

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:25.740
What happened inside there?

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:26.740
Did she make it dirty?

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:29.740
Maybe she should be a little less flirty

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:31.740
I took her to a party once

01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:33.740
No, no chorus, no

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.740
Just spitting

01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:36.740
Spitting fire

01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:37.740
Keep on doing the rhymes

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:41.740
I don't give a motherfucking shit what I do this time

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:44.740
Pacing the stage like a motherfucking tiger

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:45.740
I fucked your momma

01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:47.740
Like my name was William Riker

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:49.740
Went on to the bridge and said

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.740
Hey Picard, I'm gonna fuck your momma so hard

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.740
She gets into the prison yard

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.740
Walking dead season 3 killer ass

01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:57.740
Like she was a fucking zombie

01:22:57.740 --> 01:22:59.740
Later out, headed to class

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.740
Howard Heskman came and said

01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:02.740
What's going on?

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:03.740
I fucked your momma so hard

01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:05.740
She thought my dick was a tampon

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:07.740
It wasn't that time of month when she bled

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:09.740
I fucked your momma so hard

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:11.740
And left the way she's dead

01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:14.740
And laid in a pool of her own viscera

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.740
I fucked your momma and nobody's kissing her

01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.740
She's dead and she's alone

01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:20.740
It's a tragedy

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:24.740
It's not funny, but I laughed at me

01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:26.740
Because I did it brutally

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:30.740
I had no remorse and I did it with immunity

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:33.740
There was no sentencing, there was no jury

01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:36.740
I fucked your momma and then murdered her

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:40.740
And really, if you step back and think about it

01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:43.740
There's nothing funny about it

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:48.740
I'm sorry, I really revealed some dark shit

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:51.740
But it's a dark city

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:54.740
Now you can come back

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:56.740
Come on down to Harmontown

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.740
Rocky, turn that brown upside down

Come on down to Harmontown

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.740

Come up here

01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.740
Don't worship your fear

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:14.740
Come on up with your tie and your blazer

01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:17.740
This motherfucker's gonna rap like a laser

01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:18.740
What's your name?

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.740
My name is Austin

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:22.740
Austin's gonna rap now, it's gonna be awesome

01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:23.740

Yeah, looking like you're having just another spasm

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.740
What is that shit? I cannot even fathom

01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:44.740
Look at this fandom, it is so fucking random

01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:46.740
Kids from 2 to 20 and more

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.740
It is plenty of girls too

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.740
They're looking kind of fine

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:51.740
But not like this dude

01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:53.740
I'm gonna wine and dine, yeah

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.740
Come on down to Harmontown

01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:59.740
Austin, brown upside down

01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:01.740
Let's end it

01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:03.740
Close it down

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:05.740
Come on down to Harmontown

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:06.740
One more time

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:08.740
Austin, it can't go no further

01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.740
She's keep doing the credits

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.740
Sorry, I started rapping part

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.740
Pretend Austin ended the show

01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:18.740
One more time everyone else together

01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:19.740
Come on

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.740
Nope, wouldn't start

01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:22.740
What, what?

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.740
Nothing

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.740
She was trying to take it to the chorus

01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:27.740
Okay

01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:29.740
Yeah, but she's doing it

01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:32.740
Thank you so much, Minneapolis

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.740
I just wanna say

01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:37.740
Everyone is singing the chorus together one more time

01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:38.740
One time

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:41.740
When everyone is singing the chorus together one more time

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:45.740
Come on down to Harmontown

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:48.740

Let's hear it for Spencer

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:05.740
Spencer

01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.740
Standing down means you get an encore

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.740
Every time it stands up

01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.740
It's rapping a little bit more

01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:12.740
I'm gonna disappoint you

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:13.740
I'm gonna let you down

01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:15.740
I fucked your mama so hard

01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:16.740
She went to ground round

01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:19.740
Hey, but she weighed like David Spade

01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:21.740
And the rubber maid threw her ass away

01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:23.740
Into the garbage and laid my day

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:25.740
I fucked your mama, Minneapolis

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.740
I fucked your mama, didn't give a mother fuckin'

01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.740
Minneapolis

01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:31.740
Peace, if you bought anything

01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.740
I'll sign it back there for an hour

01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.740
And then we're gonna go to a different place

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.740
And you'll know, we'll tell you

01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:38.740
Thank you, everyone

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.740

Drop your mic

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:54.740
Oh, you want me to drop the mic?

01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:55.740
Yeah, just drop it

01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:57.740
Yeah

01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.740
It's a very expensive mic

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:00.740
I dropped the other one

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.740
I'm talking to the one I didn't drop

01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:05.740

Tony with his plantar spasitis

01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:13.740
The guy that you'll fuck you

01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:16.740
The Jaffer who just wanted bananas

01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:18.740
And thought you'd have his back

01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:21.740
Sam in the back who can't tell a hyena

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:23.740
From a giraffe

01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:25.740
A man who would just, or Joe

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.740
Would just stand up here, okay?

01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.740
All right, everybody, many apples, thank you

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.740
Many apples!

01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:33.740
Good night

01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:37.740
And oh, the outro music

01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:38.740
That's something that I do

01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:40.740
Oh, nope, this is the intro music and

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:45.740
Sorry, everybody, this is the outro music

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:55.740
Come on, Tony, come on

01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.740
Come on

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:47.740
Come on
