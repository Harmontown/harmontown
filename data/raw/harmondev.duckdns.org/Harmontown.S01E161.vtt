{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:16.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, in the secret confines of Meltdown Comics' back room...\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:21.000\nHarmontown is now in session!\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:23.000\nHere we go!\n\n00:28.000 --> 00:31.000\nLet's figure out our game master, Mr. Spencer Crittenden!\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:43.000\nAnd just for good measure, our mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon!\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:56.000\nSpencer, why don't you talk to Jeff for a second?\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:59.000\nHey Jeff, is that your musical choice? That was really good!\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:01.000\nDamn it! God damn it!\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:03.000\nStop the show!\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:07.000\nYou dropped the chicken tongues?\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:09.000\nYou dropped the chicken tongues?\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:16.000\nSpencer, right now, while Dan tries to make himself a drink,\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:20.000\nright now, what geopolitically is bothering you the most right now?\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:22.000\nGeopolitically?\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:24.000\nLike, what in the world...\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:25.000\nOh man.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:28.000\nI'm going to do a segment called, What in the world is bothering Spencer right now?\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:31.000\nThe violent gang violence in Mexico.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:32.000\nFor real?\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:35.000\nYeah, it's not a joke.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:37.000\nI was thinking about it.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:42.000\nIt would be if you had told us in advance and we could prepare the appropriate theme music.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:49.000\nViolence in Mexico.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:51.000\nYeah.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:54.000\nGet us up to date with what's going on in Mexico right now.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:58.000\nI think it's mostly still just the same stuff, you know?\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:01.000\nLike, the gangs are just fucking shooting everyone all the time.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:03.000\nThere's just shootouts in the streets.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.000\nI mean, it's just violence.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:06.000\nNon-stop.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:07.000\nDrug wars.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:09.000\nWar on drugs.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:10.000\nWar on crime.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:12.000\nYou know, our war on drugs isn't helping.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:14.000\nI'll tell you that right now.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nI don't think stopping the war on drugs would solve the problem, though.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nI'll be honest.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:23.000\nI've always said, why not a war on spiders?\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:29.000\nDrugs don't dangle down on string and go into your mouth while you're sleeping.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:36.000\nThey don't lay a million eggs and crawl around with them on their body and then scatter.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:41.000\nThey don't have tiny green reflections in their eyes that you can see if you shine a flashlight.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:42.000\nYeah.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:45.000\nI've been on Reddit a lot this weekend.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:50.000\nLike, I was supposed to write and I finished the script, but not until I had gone down all these.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:54.000\nThe things that I'll do to keep from writing are like so...\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nLike, I would...\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:06.000\nIn my third hour of investigating, going down the rabbit hole of Sandy Hook conspiracy theories,\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nI was like, you'd rather you just...\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:14.000\nYou're surrounded by dead children.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:17.000\nLike, in your mind, rather than working.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nWhat's the leading conspiracy theory on Sandy Hook?\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nThese people are...\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:27.000\nI'm sorry, gang, but you're bad people.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:30.000\nI don't know why I'm apologizing to them, I guess because...\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:34.000\nHere's the thing, some people love their guns so much that...\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:38.000\nYou're like, 20 kids for your gun and they're like, well, that's a lot of kids.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nToo bad that hasn't happened.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:45.000\nAnd so you're like, no, it just happened and they're like, show me a picture.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:49.000\nShow me a picture of the 20 kids and we're like, that's gross.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:53.000\nAnd they're like, no gun. Like, conspiracy.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:56.000\nWait, they think the conspiracy is that it didn't really happen.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:59.000\nThey think it didn't happen or that it was perpetrated by...\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:03.000\nBecause the conspiracy theories have the luxury of going from the end result.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:09.000\nSo anything that would service ultimately, for instance, an anti-gun agenda,\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:12.000\nthen you can just write backwards your conspiracy.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:14.000\nYou can rube Goldberg too.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:19.000\nAnd you don't even need to do that because you can just go, hey, how come this woman's name is Cheerio,\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:22.000\nbut when you look at the Cheerios box, it says no trans fat.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nBut then look at what this guy in CNN is saying.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:32.000\nThere's a fine line between conspiracy theory passion and just absolute schizophrenia.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:35.000\nJust noticing connections, connecting dots.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:42.000\nDo you have a conspiracy that you adhere to? Is there a thing that you think there might be a conspiracy on?\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:47.000\nBecause I haven't researched it, I am quite fond of the idea that...\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:51.000\nWho was the original...\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nThe Honeycomb hideout was actually a terrorist cell.\n\n04:53.000 --> 05:00.000\nWilliam Randolph-Hurst and the DuPont company, the reason Pot was vilified was because\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:07.000\nhemp would have made paper cheaper and didn't need to be chemically treated by DuPont the right way.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:12.000\nI like the Pot stuff. I believe that stuff.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:17.000\nThe real conspiracy is that you can track all drug legislation in the United States\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nto there was this crazy depressing documentary about it,\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:28.000\nthat drug policy is linked inexorably throughout our history to racial politics.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:33.000\nIf you have a lot of Chinese labor in your country, opium becomes illegal\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:37.000\nbecause there's a culture to this drug that they bring in with them.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:41.000\nIt's something that they're using, that they brought with them.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:46.000\nYou make it illegal so you're effectively making it possible to kick in their doors anytime you want\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nor do anything you want.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:57.000\nThat drug policy has always made a handy leash on any group that we've wanted to just have extra power over.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:02.000\nSpencer, do you have a pet conspiracy theory?\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:07.000\nNo.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:08.000\nNothing?\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:15.000\nMaybe. I mean, not that I would imagine is outlandish enough to be entitled that, but yeah, no.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nI'm sorry, everybody.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nWhat do you think that we're getting away with right now?\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nWhat?\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:28.000\nI feel like you, Spencer, I can't even see it right now because Dan's standing in the way.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:29.000\nDon't worry, I feel you.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:30.000\nThey put my mic here, man.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:31.000\nThis is where I'm supposed to stand.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:32.000\nIt's for the cameras.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:37.000\nSpencer, are you saying that you think that everything's fine, that there's no conspiracies in the world\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nthat we're not getting away with anything?\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nWell, I mean, I'm sure there's lots of conspiracies.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nI just don't know about them.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:47.000\nLike, I mean, there's corruption all over Asia, right?\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:50.000\nJust in the government?\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:51.000\nLike, go on.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nThere could be called conspiracies.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nI mean, I don't have specifics.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nGive me some Asian corruption.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:01.000\nWell, I mean, Chinese officials, they just bribe people and they do housing projects.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nI mean, there's just illegal stuff.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:04.000\nLike, you read about it.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:05.000\nRight.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:16.000\nIf you like Asian corruption, getting caught in the rain.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:17.000\nI'm a syllable guy.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nI like syllables.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:22.000\nI like to notice when things will fit like that.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:23.000\nAll right.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:24.000\nSo, okay.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.000\nSo, game changer.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nI already talked it out in the green room.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\nHere's a new segment called, I talked it out in the green room.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:34.000\nHey, talking out in the green room.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nSo, it's not going to be as filled with joy.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:41.000\nAnd it's going to trickle down to you and you'll be bored.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:44.000\nThe VR technology is here, Jeff.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nIt's here.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:46.000\nIt's here.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:47.000\nIt's here.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nIt's the valve has won.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:57.000\nThey have crossed the finish line in the first leg of the race to have consumer level VR be amazing.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nLike, I just finished.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:03.000\nI came from Justin Roiland's house and he has one of those valve things.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nHe's like a developer for it.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nA valve?\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:13.000\nValve is a video game company that they've always been on the bleeding edge, Jeff.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.000\nThe cutting bleeding edge.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:15.000\nNot the bleeding edge.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nThe bleeding edge.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nOkay.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:22.000\nTheir edge was razor sharp and caused a lot of bleeding.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:27.000\nNow, we've gotten to the point because of virtual technology, their edge is now bleeding.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nLike, they don't even need to cut things anymore.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:30.000\nOkay.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.000\nThat's when you're so far out in front.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:32.000\nThere's nothing to cut.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:36.000\nWell, then make the edge bleed.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:37.000\nAye, aye, captain.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nI trust him with my life.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:41.000\nThat's the ship they're running at valve.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nThey've always been there.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nThis is not a paid statement.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nIt sounds like it.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:56.000\nWell, tough titties for Walter Mitty's.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:59.000\nNow, Dan, explain who Walter Mitty is for these people.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nThey know.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nIt's Ben Stiller.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:02.000\nOkay.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:03.000\nThey know.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:08.000\nCan that be the episode title?\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nYou guys don't know.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:14.000\nThat movie is based on an old viewmaster reel.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:19.000\nSo, I'm just saying, okay, I've tried all the other shit.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:28.000\nAnd I'm not going to name names because there's going to be a fucking thug-like war between these VR companies and valves going to win.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:35.000\nI put on the goddamn helmet and I was fucking in a virtual reality.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:43.000\nI mean, you've all put on the things where you're kind of like, oh, it hurts my brain, but I guess I'm kind of in a Swiss villa.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:53.000\nIt's like, and I've tried everything and I walk out just feeling awkward and embarrassed because it's still like the 90s.\n\n09:53.000 --> 10:02.000\nAnd it's like, okay, yeah, I guess what you've accomplished here is you have figured out a way to make a plastic helmet that has the equivalent of an iPhone in front of my face.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:07.000\nSo that when I look through it, I can experience an app that you created.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:12.000\nIt's terrible and you walk out feeling really sad, really sad for all the people that spent billions of dollars.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:16.000\nThere's children starving in probably Asia for sure, right?\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nYeah.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nAll the officials are taking their foods.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nThen you put this shit on.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nIt's like putting a sock on your head.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:34.000\nBut that's a bad metaphor. It's over, Jeff. It's over. We've crossed the new threshold.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nWas there a game that you played?\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:38.000\nThere was a lot of things I played. They have these little sample things.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:45.000\nOne of them is you're standing in a kitchen and I'm telling you, you make soup.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:49.000\nThat's not a lie. I'm telling you, that's what you do. You make soup.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:54.000\nAnd the whole time you're making soup, you're like, get the fuck out of here because it's like the fridge and the microwave.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nYou're like just fucking jam and shit with your hands.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:01.000\nAnd there's like a thing that's like, you need to make soup and it's like two carrots.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nYou've got to go in and you're like, there's the carrots.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:07.000\nThere's another carrot. You can like fucking open the fridge with your other hand.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nYou drop it in the pot. You make soup.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nCan you make soup wrong or right?\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nThere's a way to measure whether you made the soup right or wrong.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:19.000\nYou don't put the right ingredients into the whatever container requires that thing being made.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:24.000\nBut then, yeah, after a while you take the pot and you try throwing it at the robot that's telling you to make soup.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:29.000\nAnd it's like, it hits it and you're like, Jesus Christ.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:32.000\nIt's not even a game. There's no score. There's no countdown. There's no pressure.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:38.000\nI sit on an iPad and I play games where I'm like, you know, Natalie's diner. You got to make a sandwich.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:45.000\nAnd I'm like, you know, Erin's like, it's four in the morning, don't you have a, shut the fuck up.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:49.000\nLike I've almost earned chopsticks.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:52.000\nThis is like crazy.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:59.000\nIs there a verifiable way that they say, okay, you made the best Reuben of all time or are you fucked it up?\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:00.000\nJust guys.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nI don't know.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nNo, it's not that.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nIt's not far enough along, Jeff.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:12.000\nYou're interpreting what I'm saying to you as if the reality of making a sandwich is like there.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:16.000\nIt's not simply sandwich making, but it's not about the quality of the sandwich.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:23.000\nIt's about your ability to interact with an actual virtual environment in a way that has only previously been done in movies.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:28.000\nSo walk me through this. So you see like a stack of bread slices of bread?\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:29.000\nSoup.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nSoup.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:34.000\nIt's fine. You don't just make soup. It's a cold kitchen.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:37.000\nOkay. Let's say you see a carrot. You can walk over and grab a carrot.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:38.000\nYou grab the fucking carrot.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nAnd do you chop the carrot up?\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:44.000\nWell, you know, I bet you could, but I didn't.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nWhy didn't you chop the carrot?\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:52.000\nYou see, you feel like you're investigating a soup simulator as if like, you're like, wait, if you can't chop it up.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nThe reason I told you-\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:57.000\nThis sounds like a soup simulator. I want to know why.\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:03.000\nBut I'm telling you, the thing that's going to blow your mind has nothing to do with how accurately it simulates making soup.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:06.000\nI'm saying you make soup.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nYou dig?\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:12.000\nLike, it doesn't matter if it's not like, like making soup.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nIt's like you make soup.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:15.000\nBut do you-\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:16.000\nAnd word-\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nFirst of all, don't drop an Mbamami while I'm talking about carrots.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:27.000\nBut that's the only word that could possibly express, like, my- to probably punctuate my-\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:33.000\nWalk me through, like, what is the- how specific do you get? Like, you grab an onion and do you cut the onion?\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:34.000\nYou just drop it in a pot.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nI'm telling you, it's no more sophisticated on the level of-\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nDropping an onion in a pot is not making soup.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:46.000\nThis guy, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, this is the thing. This is the crazy thing about it is, it's not- it's like-\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:53.000\nBut you're a Minecraft guy. Wouldn't you like to be able to chop up and, like, get rewarded for dicing the onion perfectly or not?\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:54.000\nNo, man.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nNo.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nMinecraft is like low-fi and high-function. That's exactly-\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nOkay.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:02.000\nThank you for proving my point. For wandering into my demons land.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nI don't know. I don't play these games.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nAnyways, whatever that is.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nWhat's the controller? Is it your body?\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:11.000\nRight now, it's still just like, we sticks basically, like, but they have their own.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:18.000\nBut they can easily, it's just a matter of expenditure, you know, like, they can easily make, like, you know, easily.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:24.000\nLike, based on what you're doing, like, it's a really cheap, like, fucking glove that you could, like, grab the carrot!\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:27.000\nAnd it's real! It's a real carrot!\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nAnd I picked up a knife and I went like this.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:33.000\nYou're dropping a carrot. See, that's what I'm talking about.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:39.000\nAnd I kept doing it, and I was like, I was scared. I was like, what if blood flies out?\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:43.000\nThat's what I'm talking about. When you hold the knife, what is the knife's function?\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nIs it an actual- can you chop?\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nI probably could have chopped carrots, yeah.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nOkay. I bet.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nThat's possible.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:52.000\nI didn't try. I was in there five minutes, and then they put me somewhere else, and then they put me somewhere else.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nShit is crazy!\n\n14:54.000 --> 15:00.000\nBut your first instinct was to see whether or not you could slit your own throat with it with a knife.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:08.000\nBut, see, that, if you have a real knife and you hold up to your throat, you should just pass out and die, right?\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:17.000\nThat would be one of the many great applications of virtual reality is loopable suicide.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nYes.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:23.000\nI mean, believe me, we're coming up on crazy days.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:29.000\nWe're going to go right- talk about whiplash. We're going to go from the days of, and I'm not making fun of anybody for-\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:34.000\nI'm not one of these guys that's like- I was one of these guys, and now I'm not. I'm old and I'm tired.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:38.000\nI accept your triggers and your sensitivities and everything. I love you.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:41.000\nI support you in watching a TV show and being affected by it.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nWhoa! The TV show hurt me.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nDear diary.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:49.000\nI got hurt. Okay, now I'm making fun of you.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nYou know what? I hurt myself.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nYou said you wouldn't do it.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nI'm making a little bit of fun of you.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:58.000\nBut that's because my dad hit me!\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nIn front of Cheers!\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:06.000\nI didn't- I was like, I don't watch Cheers and be like, okay, never mind.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nI'm sure your dad hit you too.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:14.000\nWere you ever hit in front of iconic TV or was it always down in the basement?\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:19.000\nThere's so many- there was a Napoleon bobblehead going...\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:25.000\nAnd that's why I- and I tried. I still got a C-minus in French history. I didn't complain.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:32.000\nSo we're gonna- I'm just saying we're gonna do this whip thing because it's like, holy shit.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:37.000\nDear Hannibal Season 2. I've always triggered by this thing and blah blah blah.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:42.000\nAnd then it's gonna be like, listen man, you can do one of eight things when you put this helmet on.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:46.000\nThere's gonna be lots of ways to just hang out in there and just be like,\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:51.000\nI'm a big sea otter bouncing an ice cream cone off my belly.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:57.000\nBut then it's- you know, there's gonna be a lot of just stab stab stab or like, here's a map of my school.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:01.000\nI don't- I'd like like like, when people are like devou-\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nYeah.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:07.000\nThat's what I'm saying to you.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:12.000\nYou're not reacting to me, we're reacting to the future.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nJust to make that clear.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:21.000\nAnd it's gonna get- I'm not sure that's true. It's gonna get crazy, as the kids say.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nThey add A's now.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:26.000\nAlright, so I've already talked too much.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:30.000\nI had the- well I did that and then I had the worst Uber driver ever.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:31.000\nUber, Uber Corner?\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nUber Corner.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:37.000\nShit, I can't play on like-\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nOkay.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:46.000\nAlright, I can't work like this.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:49.000\nHe's just a bad Uber driver and I can't- I can't, the theme's-\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nWhat was his name or her name?\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nI don't know.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nStep notes?\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:59.000\nHe wouldn't pick me up, I was standing outside the oyster bar and because I was-\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:02.000\nI walked from Justin's construction all over Sherman Oaks.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:06.000\nSo I walked to a place where there was no construction to call an Uber.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:10.000\nI wasn't gonna try to make anybody navigate construction with their Uber.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nThat wasn't- that wasn't my goal.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nI took the hit.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:15.000\nI walked to a place.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:16.000\nI sat down.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.000\nI ordered a drink.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nI leave only footprints.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:20.000\nI don't hang out.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:21.000\nI don't loiter.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nI don't abuse Uber drivers.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nI don't do anything to make anyone's life difficult.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nI float on the wind.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nI'm-\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\nI'm- I'm Forrest Gump's feather.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:31.000\nAnd word.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:35.000\nAgain, the second- the second time that was necessary.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:38.000\nSo I call the guy and then I get- it says, your Uber's here.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nI go out in the sidewalk.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:42.000\nAnd by the way, the fact that I had to go out in the sidewalk meant I had to pay $20\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:47.000\nbecause I had to- he came so fast that I was like, oh, shit.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nWell, I'll just have to leave a 20 and let him keep the change.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\n$20 drink.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nSo I'm already all revved up.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:59.000\nI'm out on Moor Park and it's hot and I'm like- and I'm like, well, it says he's here\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.000\nbut he's not here.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:04.000\nI mean, there's like- it's nothing but fucking- because of the construction, like, it's easy.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nGod damn it.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:10.000\nAnd the guy calls me and he- and it's just like, you just hear music in the background\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nand it's like-\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:15.000\nI'm not doing any ethnicity of music at all.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:20.000\nLike, it's just like blanket, just like fucked up, like unmarketable mishmash.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:25.000\nThat could have been a white guy at the end.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nAnd- and- and-\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:32.000\nWhen you left me last night, it was hoppy!\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nOkay.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nWell, Habibi-\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nWell, but when you left me last night-\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:37.000\nThat narrows it down a bit.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nNo, but that was coccasite on the front end.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nCan't pin me down.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:42.000\nYou left me-\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nI don't know what country this guy came from.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nYou left me last night because of Habibi.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:49.000\nWell, you left me last night because Habibi!\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:52.000\nBeautiful red dress, Habibi!\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:56.000\nI think that guy might be from Cincinnati.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:59.000\nCertainly by way of Syria.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:00.000\nRacist.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nSo-\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nI- I say Habibi when there's a fish special.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:08.000\nNo, you fucking don't.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:09.000\nI'm like- I'm like fucking-\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:13.000\nIt's like saying- it's like saying like like like like like like like a Mazel tov.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.000\nOkay.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nI say that sometimes.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:18.000\nI'm- you know, I don't give a fuck.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:21.000\nI'm a fucking- I'm a white privileged conqueror.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nIt assimilate everybody.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:26.000\nI'm like- I'm like a lehyam, fuck it.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:29.000\nLike- Salu, yeah, fuck you fucking-\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nSalum.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nSal- Salum?\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nAll right.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nNo, Salu, like an Italian.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nOh, Salu.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:35.000\nRacist again.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:38.000\nCan't tell Italians from my clubs.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nAll right, so-\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nSo you call the guy, it's like-\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:46.000\nAnd he keeps going like, I'm- I'm not out- I'm like- I can't- are you at the oyster bar?\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nAnd I'm going like, yeah, I'm outside the oyster bar.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nAnd he's like, I'm more park!\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nAnd I'm like, yeah, I'm more park.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nAnd I'm standing on more park.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nAnd he's like, but you're not here!\n\n20:54.000 --> 21:00.000\nAnd I'm like, you're not here.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nYou're not here.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nAnd he's like, no!\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.000\nYou're not here!\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:06.000\nAnd the music's like-\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:09.000\nI was born on the 4th of July!\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:10.000\nHabibi!\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:15.000\nAnd I'm like arguing with the guy, and he's like forever.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:18.000\nAnd I'm going like, so you're- and I look at the map, and it's like Mission Impossible.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:20.000\nI'm like, I'm zooming in on your location, sir.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nI can see your cartoon car.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:26.000\nAre you situated behind- all the way behind the oyster bar?\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nAnd he's like, I love oyster bar!\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nI'm more park!\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nLike mad at me.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nLike he's like trying to get through to me.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nAnd I'm like, I'm on more park.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nI'm outside the oyster bar.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:36.000\nI see your car.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:39.000\nI think you're in the parking lot behind oyster bar.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:43.000\nAnd while that would not normally be an issue, it's basically a block away from me,\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:47.000\nbecause you're in the fucking parking lot, and it's like- it's Sherman Oaks.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:50.000\nLike they- I can't just like cut around.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nI don't- just trust me.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nGo there, take pictures.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nSo eventually I'm like, you're in the parking lot.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nAnd he's like- and then finally he acts exasperated.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:01.000\nHe's like, are you in the parking lot of oyster bar?\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nI'm like, no!\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:04.000\nDo I look like a car?\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:08.000\nAnd you're not- you're like, why would I go into the parking lot?\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:10.000\nI don't have a car!\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nDo you think this is how I react to my car being stolen?\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nI'd be like, oh shit, my car is gone.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:21.000\nBoop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nNo, I would walk out onto Moorpark, call an Uber,\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:27.000\ngo to walk, and I'd go, and then the guy was like such a sassafras.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nBecause he was like-\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:31.000\nNow you're racist.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:36.000\nBecause I got in, and so he goes- he goes, he starts driving,\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:39.000\nand he's like, I cannot fucking- the street is just construction.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:43.000\nAnd I'm like, mmm, I took- because I know I walked into construction.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nLike I didn't say anything though.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.200\nSay it again?\n\n22:46.200 --> 22:48.520\nI said, why do you walk there to the oyster bar?\n\n22:48.520 --> 22:49.840\nBecause there's no construction.\n\n22:49.840 --> 22:52.360\nI already took that fucking hit.\n\n22:52.360 --> 22:53.880\nIf I want to hear about fucking construction,\n\n22:53.880 --> 22:57.120\nI'll close the fucking Justin's house.\n\n22:57.120 --> 22:58.120\nWhy are your teeth so gritty?\n\n22:58.120 --> 22:59.200\nBecause I'm fucking angry.\n\n22:59.200 --> 23:02.240\nWhat are you fucking dumb?\n\n23:02.240 --> 23:03.800\nI've never heard that character before,\n\n23:03.800 --> 23:04.720\nwhere you talk with you.\n\n23:04.720 --> 23:06.200\nIt's fucking anger being restrained,\n\n23:06.200 --> 23:07.960\nso I don't say something with my whole mouth.\n\n23:07.960 --> 23:08.880\nWhat do you want to say?\n\n23:08.880 --> 23:10.000\nI want to fucking suck on something.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:10.720\nLet it out.\n\n23:10.720 --> 23:11.200\nLet it out.\n\n23:11.200 --> 23:14.440\nI'll just flip my throat with a virtual knife.\n\n23:14.440 --> 23:17.200\nSo he pulls one of these.\n\n23:17.200 --> 23:22.160\nAnd by one of these, this is a new one for me.\n\n23:22.160 --> 23:24.480\nHe's driving it, and he goes, I kept fucking the thing.\n\n23:24.480 --> 23:26.920\nAnd then I'm like, OK, sure.\n\n23:26.920 --> 23:29.320\nAnd I just pulled the Jodie Foster on him.\n\n23:29.320 --> 23:33.880\nAnd by that, I mean, I looked out the window at a world\n\n23:33.880 --> 23:39.520\nmore important than him, and chose to atone with it\n\n23:39.520 --> 23:41.960\nfor all the pain I've been through,\n\n23:41.960 --> 23:44.400\nrather than I'm not going to stoop there.\n\n23:44.400 --> 23:49.400\nAnd so find the camera, and turn the light on,\n\n23:49.400 --> 23:51.520\nand give me your Jodie Foster's, that camera\n\n23:51.520 --> 23:52.520\nwith the red light there.\n\n23:52.520 --> 23:57.640\nOK, here's the Jodie Foster if you're outside my car window.\n\n23:57.640 --> 23:58.120\nOK.\n\n24:01.120 --> 24:01.880\nNow, let me do it again.\n\n24:01.880 --> 24:02.640\nLet me do it again.\n\n24:02.640 --> 24:04.280\nThat looked like somebody set off a cherry bomb\n\n24:04.280 --> 24:05.880\noutside the car.\n\n24:05.880 --> 24:08.440\nAll right, let me do it again.\n\n24:08.440 --> 24:11.440\nOK.\n\n24:11.440 --> 24:12.800\nAll right, can we move on?\n\n24:12.800 --> 24:13.920\nWe got it, we got it.\n\n24:13.920 --> 24:17.600\nSo the Jodie Foster's wrapped.\n\n24:17.600 --> 24:22.520\nSo he goes, I pick you up there before, no.\n\n24:22.520 --> 24:26.040\nAnd I said, no, not the oyster bar, no.\n\n24:26.040 --> 24:28.560\nOr he said, I drive you before, yes.\n\n24:28.560 --> 24:29.240\nThat's what he said.\n\n24:29.240 --> 24:33.080\nAnd I said, maybe, I'm like, you're bald.\n\n24:33.080 --> 24:35.360\nLike, I don't know, I don't know what to go by.\n\n24:35.360 --> 24:38.960\nAnd he's like, and many times from there.\n\n24:38.960 --> 24:41.080\nAnd I'm like, no, not the oyster bar, no.\n\n24:41.080 --> 24:43.960\nAnd he's like, yeah, yeah.\n\n24:43.960 --> 24:46.840\nHe was like, like, oh, I was like, oh, really?\n\n24:46.840 --> 24:48.400\nYou picked me up at the oyster bar a lot?\n\n24:48.400 --> 24:50.480\nHe's like, yeah, yeah.\n\n24:50.480 --> 24:51.280\nWhat?\n\n24:51.280 --> 24:55.120\nHow does he think he's going to get through this debate?\n\n24:55.120 --> 24:58.320\nLike, oh, I'm like, I said, oh, really?\n\n24:58.320 --> 25:00.360\nSo am I a doctor?\n\n25:00.360 --> 25:01.080\nHe's like, what?\n\n25:01.080 --> 25:03.280\nI'm like, where do I work?\n\n25:03.280 --> 25:06.840\nTell me some more shit about myself.\n\n25:06.840 --> 25:08.040\nBut I didn't say it like that.\n\n25:08.040 --> 25:10.960\nI was like, tell me some more shit about myself.\n\n25:10.960 --> 25:13.040\nAnd he did the scariest thing on the road.\n\n25:13.040 --> 25:14.560\nHe's like, I'm sorry, buddy.\n\n25:14.560 --> 25:15.400\nI'm sorry.\n\n25:15.400 --> 25:18.600\nAnd I felt like, oh my god, the Eastern European guys\n\n25:18.600 --> 25:21.600\nin the wire, he's going to kill me.\n\n25:21.600 --> 25:23.000\nI'm scared of Eastern Europeans.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.240\nRacist, fine.\n\n25:24.240 --> 25:25.800\nBut fine.\n\n25:25.800 --> 25:29.720\nI would rather be killed by any other ethnically\n\n25:29.720 --> 25:33.400\nidentifiable group in the world before an Eastern European.\n\n25:33.400 --> 25:34.680\nWhy?\n\n25:34.680 --> 25:35.280\nThe wire.\n\n25:35.280 --> 25:43.520\nWhich? From my extensive experience as a born identity.\n\n25:43.520 --> 25:48.080\nWhat kind of person would you pick the first person\n\n25:48.080 --> 25:48.480\nto kill you?\n\n25:48.480 --> 25:49.080\nWho would it be?\n\n25:49.080 --> 25:50.920\nI feel like, honestly, I'm going to go\n\n25:50.920 --> 25:53.200\nwith good old fashioned black guy.\n\n25:53.200 --> 25:54.640\nGood old fashioned black guy?\n\n25:54.640 --> 25:56.960\nYeah, because I feel like they're not just describing.\n\n25:56.960 --> 25:57.840\nLike, what's he wearing?\n\n25:57.840 --> 25:58.680\nWhat's he look like?\n\n25:58.680 --> 26:00.840\nNo, this is not fair what you're doing to me.\n\n26:00.840 --> 26:01.920\nI'm saying.\n\n26:01.920 --> 26:05.720\nYou said that you would think.\n\n26:05.720 --> 26:10.240\nI'm saying, first, I'm running through my simulators\n\n26:10.240 --> 26:16.240\nof if you're getting killed by an ethnic person and why are you?\n\n26:16.240 --> 26:18.560\nWhat is that death consisting of?\n\n26:18.560 --> 26:21.640\nI'm going to go with the black guy over there.\n\n26:21.640 --> 26:25.040\nThe Eastern European is like, I don't want to.\n\n26:25.040 --> 26:26.800\nI feel like I would be in a warehouse.\n\n26:26.800 --> 26:29.120\nAnd according to everything I've seen,\n\n26:29.120 --> 26:35.160\nthe first you wake up and they're like, hello, hello, big boy.\n\n26:35.160 --> 26:36.160\nAnd I'm like, what the fuck?\n\n26:36.160 --> 26:38.080\nWhat the fuck is going on?\n\n26:38.080 --> 26:40.720\nAnd they're like, you take my fucking money.\n\n26:40.720 --> 26:43.080\nAnd you're like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.\n\n26:43.080 --> 26:45.840\nAnd then there's like a crocodile in there pouring concrete.\n\n26:45.840 --> 26:48.800\nLike, wait, wait.\n\n26:48.800 --> 26:52.080\nLike, what do black people do when they kill you?\n\n26:52.080 --> 26:55.120\nHold on, tell me about the crocodile and the concrete.\n\n26:55.120 --> 26:56.160\nI don't fucking know.\n\n26:56.160 --> 26:57.120\nYou just scream.\n\n26:57.120 --> 26:59.520\nAnd then like, they find your body and David Cruz is like,\n\n26:59.520 --> 27:02.760\nlooks like crocodiles eat.\n\n27:02.760 --> 27:05.520\nTwo.\n\n27:05.520 --> 27:11.200\nOK, so that you don't want to die by Eastern European guy.\n\n27:11.200 --> 27:12.560\nBut you want to die by black guy.\n\n27:12.560 --> 27:14.240\nBecause how do you think that's going to go?\n\n27:14.240 --> 27:17.960\nWhat's the best way that you get killed by a black guy?\n\n27:17.960 --> 27:20.800\nYou're trying to make me sound racist.\n\n27:20.800 --> 27:21.560\nSo I'm going to.\n\n27:21.560 --> 27:22.280\nNo, I'm not.\n\n27:22.280 --> 27:24.000\nI'm trying to escape that nuisance.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:25.640\nI'm not saying that.\n\n27:25.640 --> 27:26.240\nYou get to pick.\n\n27:26.240 --> 27:28.240\nWe're talking about pop cultural deaths.\n\n27:28.240 --> 27:31.360\nHow do white men die in movies?\n\n27:31.360 --> 27:34.600\nAnd then so I will take one of the and the answer is if killed.\n\n27:34.600 --> 27:38.600\nThere's probably a chart like if killed by black man in movies,\n\n27:38.600 --> 27:39.640\nwhite man dies.\n\n27:39.640 --> 27:40.240\nHow?\n\n27:40.240 --> 27:41.640\nIt's not by machete.\n\n27:41.640 --> 27:44.160\nIt's not by like, like, like he's like, you know, Redwood\n\n27:44.160 --> 27:46.560\nForest and he hears his wife's voice, even though she's\n\n27:46.560 --> 27:49.560\nbeen dead for 10 years, and then he has to like see Satan\n\n27:49.560 --> 27:52.040\nand his fucking pores explode with heroin.\n\n27:52.040 --> 27:57.520\nLike if it's statistically on a on a bar graph of one race\n\n27:57.520 --> 28:01.520\nkilling another in movies, if a white guy dies by a black guy,\n\n28:01.520 --> 28:03.800\nit's like a stray bullet.\n\n28:03.800 --> 28:04.680\nA stray bullet.\n\n28:04.680 --> 28:07.520\nYeah, or so or it's like or it's like Patrick Swayze or\n\n28:07.520 --> 28:09.800\nsomething that's like, I love my wife so much.\n\n28:09.800 --> 28:11.040\nHey, man, give me your money.\n\n28:11.040 --> 28:12.520\nHey, let's be reasonable.\n\n28:12.520 --> 28:15.440\nOh, oh, I love my wife.\n\n28:15.440 --> 28:16.680\nOK, so it's easy.\n\n28:16.680 --> 28:17.480\nIt's easy.\n\n28:17.480 --> 28:18.440\nIt's soft and easy.\n\n28:18.440 --> 28:21.680\nIt's like it's like Shakespearean.\n\n28:21.680 --> 28:23.640\nI just want my pen lights up.\n\n28:23.640 --> 28:29.800\nOK, so Dan, you get to write your own death, like play along\n\n28:29.800 --> 28:30.680\nwith me here.\n\n28:30.680 --> 28:32.240\nIt's a death by another person.\n\n28:32.240 --> 28:33.160\nIt could be a man.\n\n28:33.160 --> 28:34.240\nIt could be a woman.\n\n28:34.240 --> 28:35.120\nIt's one person.\n\n28:35.120 --> 28:35.960\nWhat race?\n\n28:35.960 --> 28:36.760\nYou get to pick.\n\n28:36.760 --> 28:37.560\nI get to pick the race?\n\n28:37.560 --> 28:38.000\nYes.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:38.760\nBlack guy.\n\n28:38.760 --> 28:39.720\nOK.\n\n28:39.720 --> 28:40.880\nBut he did the second.\n\n28:40.880 --> 28:43.640\nBut how do you want that death to happen?\n\n28:43.640 --> 28:45.560\nYou get to pick.\n\n28:45.560 --> 28:48.440\nYou die because somebody else kills you.\n\n28:48.440 --> 28:49.360\nIt could be a man or woman.\n\n28:49.360 --> 28:51.120\nYou've already picked black man.\n\n28:51.120 --> 28:51.720\nRight?\n\n28:51.720 --> 28:52.280\nRight, sure.\n\n28:52.280 --> 28:53.680\nWell, I'll pick black woman.\n\n28:53.680 --> 28:55.440\nOK, well, I like that.\n\n28:55.440 --> 28:57.320\nThat's good.\n\n28:57.320 --> 28:58.080\nI deserve that.\n\n28:58.080 --> 29:00.760\nYou can pick any of them.\n\n29:00.760 --> 29:02.600\nI deserve that more.\n\n29:02.600 --> 29:03.400\nI like black women.\n\n29:03.400 --> 29:04.640\nHow would you like to die?\n\n29:04.640 --> 29:09.640\nYou get to pick the race, the gender, the whole thing.\n\n29:09.640 --> 29:13.480\nOK, well, then I guess I'm at the bank and I'm like,\n\n29:13.480 --> 29:16.160\nhere's my golf fund.\n\n29:16.160 --> 29:19.640\nAnd then she comes in and she's got a big afro\n\n29:19.640 --> 29:21.440\nand she's got an olive jacket.\n\n29:21.440 --> 29:27.080\nAnd she's hot and she's like, free, suckers,\n\n29:27.080 --> 29:31.560\nthis is a hold up for the 1970s.\n\n29:31.560 --> 29:35.160\nAnd I'm like, easy, easy.\n\n29:35.160 --> 29:38.120\nAnd then she's like, but then I can\n\n29:38.120 --> 29:40.800\nsee there's humanity in her eyes.\n\n29:40.800 --> 29:43.840\nBecause she gets fucked over.\n\n29:43.840 --> 29:46.320\nBecause she's just like, this ain't your money.\n\n29:46.320 --> 29:48.760\nShe pulls a totally smooth robbery.\n\n29:48.760 --> 29:49.840\nShe's got it down to a science.\n\n29:49.840 --> 29:52.360\nShe's like, all y'all's money is.\n\n29:52.360 --> 29:54.360\nNo, that sounds terrible.\n\n29:54.360 --> 29:57.600\nI didn't mean to do bad grammar.\n\n29:57.600 --> 29:59.800\nAll y'all's money is insured.\n\n29:59.800 --> 30:01.960\nIt was the plural on the y'all's that sounded terrible.\n\n30:01.960 --> 30:03.880\nAll y'all's money is insured.\n\n30:03.880 --> 30:04.800\nThis ain't your money.\n\n30:04.800 --> 30:06.160\nIt's the government's money.\n\n30:06.160 --> 30:07.080\nThey fucked you over.\n\n30:07.080 --> 30:08.320\nNow I'm fucking them over.\n\n30:08.320 --> 30:10.040\nSo keep your goddamn head down.\n\n30:10.040 --> 30:11.200\nYou won't get a blown off.\n\n30:11.200 --> 30:13.800\nAnd I'm like, she sounds like she knows what she's doing.\n\n30:13.800 --> 30:15.120\nAnd then she's filling her bag.\n\n30:15.120 --> 30:17.880\nAnd then somebody just pulls some crazy shit on her.\n\n30:17.880 --> 30:20.160\nLike the bad honky.\n\n30:20.160 --> 30:24.160\nLike he hits the alarm, and he shouldn't hit the alarm.\n\n30:24.160 --> 30:26.400\nWho do you cast as a bad honky in this?\n\n30:26.400 --> 30:27.560\nIt's Dabney Coleman.\n\n30:27.560 --> 30:31.440\nAnd then it's like, and he did it, and he did it.\n\n30:31.440 --> 30:33.240\nAnd she's like, why did you do that?\n\n30:33.240 --> 30:34.360\nWhy did you do that?\n\n30:34.360 --> 30:37.000\nAnd I don't know what happens at that point.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:38.480\nShe gets shot.\n\n30:38.480 --> 30:41.960\nLike Dabney Coleman's got a little fucking asshole gun.\n\n30:41.960 --> 30:43.440\nAnd then she gets shot.\n\n30:43.440 --> 30:44.760\nBut then something happens, and I\n\n30:44.760 --> 30:46.840\ndon't have time to write the whole thing, but basically\n\n30:46.840 --> 30:50.600\nit ends up with me and her in the bank vault.\n\n30:50.600 --> 30:53.740\nBecause I somehow, it was kind of like a dog day afternoon\n\n30:53.740 --> 30:55.400\nmeets Cadillac Man.\n\n30:55.400 --> 31:00.160\nLike what do you call it?\n\n31:00.160 --> 31:01.880\nStockholm syndrome kind of thing.\n\n31:01.880 --> 31:06.200\nBut it's like she and I, we end up,\n\n31:06.200 --> 31:08.640\nwe solve everything in those dark days\n\n31:08.640 --> 31:10.720\nbefore we die together.\n\n31:10.720 --> 31:11.760\nBecause she has to kill me.\n\n31:11.760 --> 31:12.640\nHow do you die, though?\n\n31:12.640 --> 31:15.200\nWell, she has to, I mean, I'm picking this\n\n31:15.200 --> 31:17.240\nbecause I died by a black woman.\n\n31:17.240 --> 31:18.440\nSo she has to kill me, right?\n\n31:18.440 --> 31:20.120\nBut under what circumstances?\n\n31:20.120 --> 31:21.440\nThird act, how do you?\n\n31:21.440 --> 31:23.760\nI guess right at the end, I reveal myself to be like,\n\n31:23.760 --> 31:27.640\nI'm like, I'm sorry, you can't trust me either.\n\n31:27.640 --> 31:29.600\nAnd then she shoots me?\n\n31:29.600 --> 31:30.960\nYeah, it feels bad.\n\n31:30.960 --> 31:33.680\nI don't want to be selfish, but I'd rather\n\n31:33.680 --> 31:37.560\nshe has to kill me because I like, oh, oh, oh, I know why.\n\n31:37.560 --> 31:39.960\nBecause I helped her.\n\n31:39.960 --> 31:41.800\nI aided and abetted her.\n\n31:41.800 --> 31:44.960\nAnd I'm like, there's nothing in my insurance policy\n\n31:44.960 --> 31:47.880\nabout treason.\n\n31:47.880 --> 31:48.640\nDo it.\n\n31:48.640 --> 31:49.960\nDo it for my wife and kids.\n\n31:49.960 --> 31:53.880\nAnd she's like, I can't do it, Mr. Harmon.\n\n31:53.880 --> 31:56.640\nAnd I'm like, don't you ever fucking call me Mr. Anything.\n\n31:56.640 --> 32:00.400\nYou fucking awesome black woman.\n\n32:00.400 --> 32:04.040\nAnd she's like, you fucking unexpectedly wonderful white\n\n32:04.040 --> 32:05.760\nman.\n\n32:05.760 --> 32:08.120\nAnd I'm like, just fucking shoot me.\n\n32:08.120 --> 32:09.280\nAnd it goes black.\n\n32:09.280 --> 32:15.240\nAnd then it's just like fucking Aaron Sorkin.\n\n32:15.240 --> 32:22.800\nSo that's a good death.\n\n32:22.800 --> 32:26.000\nI don't want that to be misperceived\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:29.600\nas an invitation of any kind to black women across America.\n\n32:29.600 --> 32:30.400\nIt's too late now.\n\n32:30.400 --> 32:31.680\nIt's already out there.\n\n32:31.680 --> 32:34.080\nSpencer, how would you die if you could pick a way\n\n32:34.080 --> 32:35.560\nto be murdered by another human being?\n\n32:35.560 --> 32:35.840\nHow would it go down?\n\n32:35.840 --> 32:37.040\nYou have to pick race and gender.\n\n32:37.040 --> 32:38.000\nThat's what I'm interested in.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.120\nOh, who is your murderer?\n\n32:40.120 --> 32:41.800\nOr it could be an animal.\n\n32:41.800 --> 32:42.440\nIt could be a woman.\n\n32:42.440 --> 32:42.960\nIt could be a man.\n\n32:42.960 --> 32:43.600\nIt could be anything.\n\n32:43.600 --> 32:45.000\nI'm going to keep it Asian.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:49.040\nI'm going to go with sumo wrestler would be awesome.\n\n32:49.040 --> 32:50.440\nWhoa.\n\n32:50.440 --> 32:53.520\nBut he just ripped my head off my body.\n\n32:53.520 --> 32:57.600\nBut walk us through how that goes down.\n\n32:57.600 --> 32:58.080\nWhy?\n\n32:58.080 --> 32:58.600\nAll right.\n\n32:58.600 --> 33:06.840\nSo I'm at the supermarket looking at frozen vegetables.\n\n33:06.840 --> 33:10.160\nAnd I bump my cart into someone's cart.\n\n33:10.160 --> 33:12.040\nAnd I go, oh, shit.\n\n33:12.040 --> 33:14.320\nSumo wrestler.\n\n33:14.320 --> 33:16.000\nAnd he's not having it.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:17.320\nAnd I'm like, I'm sorry, man.\n\n33:17.320 --> 33:19.560\nI'm just trying to get some peas.\n\n33:19.560 --> 33:21.600\nAnd he's like, I'm trying to get something.\n\n33:21.600 --> 33:22.880\nAnd I ask, what?\n\n33:22.880 --> 33:24.680\nAnd he says, your head.\n\n33:24.680 --> 33:26.240\nAnd then he just rips off my head.\n\n33:29.240 --> 33:30.760\nAll right.\n\n33:30.760 --> 33:39.320\nWell, our next guests are no strangers to racism.\n\n33:39.320 --> 33:41.280\nThese are actually really old friends of ours.\n\n33:41.280 --> 33:43.080\nI bet a lot of people would be surprised how long we've\n\n33:43.080 --> 33:43.760\nknown these guys.\n\n33:43.760 --> 33:45.360\nWe don't hang out every day.\n\n33:45.360 --> 33:49.160\nBut our connection goes way back to pre-Youtube days\n\n33:49.160 --> 33:50.320\nand channel 101.\n\n33:50.320 --> 33:53.280\nI hope they don't want to know.\n\n33:53.280 --> 33:56.120\nThey're not trying to keep their age secret, right?\n\n33:56.120 --> 33:58.280\nBecause unless they were 11 back then.\n\n33:58.280 --> 34:01.120\nOh, boy, are we old.\n\n34:01.120 --> 34:03.440\nBut they were part of this amazing troop\n\n34:03.440 --> 34:05.560\nthat was doing early, like channel 101 New York stuff.\n\n34:05.560 --> 34:07.160\nThe human giant.\n\n34:07.160 --> 34:08.200\nThe other guy was a Z-Ease.\n\n34:08.200 --> 34:09.080\nAnd he went, you know.\n\n34:09.080 --> 34:11.160\nI mean, one thing I want to talk to these guys about\n\n34:11.160 --> 34:14.560\nis that they've never, I don't know, that's like that troop.\n\n34:14.560 --> 34:18.200\nLike, it never goes like, OK, we're Simon and Garfunkel.\n\n34:18.200 --> 34:19.320\nWe're going this way or that way.\n\n34:19.320 --> 34:21.720\nOr we're breaking up or we're reuniting, as far as I know.\n\n34:21.720 --> 34:25.320\nThey've kind of all individually done amazing stuff.\n\n34:25.320 --> 34:28.560\nWe've got two of them here tonight promoting a,\n\n34:28.560 --> 34:30.960\nthat makes it seem crass that they're here promoting something.\n\n34:30.960 --> 34:32.320\nThey're just here.\n\n34:32.320 --> 34:35.160\nIf they promote something, it's on accident.\n\n34:35.160 --> 34:38.680\nBut they just finished working on something, a concert movie\n\n34:38.680 --> 34:39.840\nthat we'll talk about, too.\n\n34:39.840 --> 34:42.280\nSo let's welcome some old friends of mine\n\n34:42.280 --> 34:44.400\nand some new friends of yours, Misty.\n\n34:48.160 --> 34:48.880\nThat was good.\n\n34:48.880 --> 34:49.560\nThat was really good.\n\n34:49.560 --> 34:53.040\nI've been looking for a standard intro like Duncan Trussell\n\n34:53.040 --> 34:53.520\nhas.\n\n34:53.520 --> 34:55.040\nYou choked over in the back, but that was actually\n\n34:55.040 --> 34:55.760\nreally good.\n\n34:55.760 --> 34:58.400\nNo, no, that's why I laughed because it was so good.\n\n34:58.400 --> 35:02.120\nI was like, oh, wow, that's nice.\n\n35:02.120 --> 35:05.560\nSay it again, but say it was, like, throw it away.\n\n35:05.560 --> 35:07.840\nDo it like that means nothing to you.\n\n35:07.840 --> 35:11.400\nSo please give an H-town welcome for some old friends of mine\n\n35:11.400 --> 35:14.440\nand new friends of yours, Mr. Paul Scheer and Rob Hubel.\n\n35:14.440 --> 35:32.600\nHi.\n\n35:32.600 --> 35:35.040\nI'm watching the live stream backstage\n\n35:35.040 --> 35:36.560\nand just thinking it would be great\n\n35:36.560 --> 35:39.680\nif there was a thermometer reading on the live stream\n\n35:39.680 --> 35:43.720\njust to see how the temperature is treating everybody here.\n\n35:43.720 --> 35:44.600\nWell, you don't need one.\n\n35:44.600 --> 35:50.360\nYou have the equivalent of a mercury bird.\n\n35:50.360 --> 35:52.640\nBecause I was just thinking, I'm pouring sweat.\n\n35:52.640 --> 35:55.240\nOh, I did a show here earlier today.\n\n35:55.240 --> 35:56.200\nI poured sweat.\n\n35:56.200 --> 35:58.520\nI stopped, and now I've come back to pour sweat again.\n\n35:58.520 --> 35:59.080\nThis is it.\n\n35:59.080 --> 36:00.320\nThis is my workout for the week.\n\n36:00.320 --> 36:00.920\nThank you.\n\n36:00.920 --> 36:03.640\nI don't sweat at all.\n\n36:03.640 --> 36:05.600\nI'm tired of having to explain to these guys.\n\n36:05.600 --> 36:07.800\nIt's six degrees colder out there.\n\n36:07.800 --> 36:09.920\nI'm not just a pollution.\n\n36:09.920 --> 36:13.440\nYou're the reverse letterman.\n\n36:13.440 --> 36:16.120\nLetterman keeps the studio cool, like 60 degrees.\n\n36:16.120 --> 36:19.960\nYou jack it up to 107 degrees.\n\n36:19.960 --> 36:21.440\nAll right, so let's dig in.\n\n36:25.880 --> 36:26.360\nWhat?\n\n36:26.360 --> 36:27.360\nWait.\n\n36:27.360 --> 36:30.800\nRob, you have to pick a way you're going to die.\n\n36:30.800 --> 36:33.440\nBut Paul has to be the one that kills you.\n\n36:33.440 --> 36:35.520\nYou get to pick the circumstances and the way\n\n36:35.520 --> 36:36.560\nthat he dispatches you.\n\n36:36.560 --> 36:40.360\nHow do you let Paul Scheer murder you?\n\n36:40.360 --> 36:43.800\nFirst of all, great question.\n\n36:43.800 --> 36:46.320\nI've given this a lot of thought, actually.\n\n36:46.320 --> 36:48.560\nIs it something, do I have to be aware of it before it\n\n36:48.560 --> 36:50.640\nhappens, or can it be sort of like a sneak attack?\n\n36:50.640 --> 36:51.240\nYou get to pick.\n\n36:51.240 --> 36:52.840\nAlso, it could be when you're 90 years old.\n\n36:52.840 --> 36:53.640\nIt could be tomorrow.\n\n36:53.640 --> 36:55.520\nIt could be when you're five years old.\n\n36:55.520 --> 36:57.120\nIt could be anything you want.\n\n36:57.120 --> 36:58.160\nYou have to die.\n\n36:58.160 --> 37:00.320\nWhen he was five years old.\n\n37:00.320 --> 37:03.000\nSo he can go back in time and kill himself.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:03.600\nWow.\n\n37:03.600 --> 37:05.080\nHe gets to pick how he dies, but it\n\n37:05.080 --> 37:07.360\nhas to be at Paul Scheer's hand.\n\n37:07.360 --> 37:08.480\nHow do you like to go out?\n\n37:08.480 --> 37:10.880\nGo my time traveling back, like a terminator?\n\n37:10.880 --> 37:12.240\nIt's up to Rob.\n\n37:12.240 --> 37:13.640\nAll right, it's up to Rob.\n\n37:13.640 --> 37:16.480\nIf he does time travel back, is he totally nude?\n\n37:16.480 --> 37:19.400\nLike a...\n\n37:19.400 --> 37:20.920\nSee, this is why I ask.\n\n37:20.920 --> 37:23.280\nBecause I feel like that's where you want us to go.\n\n37:23.280 --> 37:23.800\nRight.\n\n37:23.800 --> 37:25.680\nSo you get to pick.\n\n37:25.680 --> 37:27.880\nNot only do you get to pick how Paul kills you.\n\n37:27.880 --> 37:30.040\nYou get to pick what he's wearing or what he's not wearing.\n\n37:30.040 --> 37:32.000\nIt sounds like he has to be nude and five years old.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:33.920\nWell, I mean, yeah.\n\n37:33.920 --> 37:35.920\nI would love a five-year-old terminator.\n\n37:35.920 --> 37:38.800\nThat would be the best version of the new terminator.\n\n37:38.800 --> 37:42.040\nJust like a really bad ass kid.\n\n37:42.040 --> 37:42.640\nAll right, I think I got it.\n\n37:42.640 --> 37:43.800\nA little criminal child.\n\n37:43.800 --> 37:44.440\nI think I got it.\n\n37:44.440 --> 37:45.080\nRob, you got it?\n\n37:45.080 --> 37:48.520\nYeah, I think it was my birthday when I was seven years old.\n\n37:48.520 --> 37:52.400\nMy parents had this really sort of homegrown birthday party\n\n37:52.400 --> 37:54.960\nfor me where they had like my little friends come over.\n\n37:54.960 --> 37:57.920\nAnd I don't know why they did this, but they made a ton,\n\n37:57.920 --> 38:00.400\na shit ton of like mashed potatoes.\n\n38:00.400 --> 38:02.880\nAnd we were all like in our swimsuit.\n\n38:02.880 --> 38:05.280\nThis sounds very erotic.\n\n38:05.280 --> 38:06.400\nWe were all like in our swimsuit.\n\n38:06.400 --> 38:09.200\nA birthday party with tons of mashed potatoes?\n\n38:09.200 --> 38:09.960\nOh, wait, explain.\n\n38:09.960 --> 38:14.240\nI'm fucking hard as a fucking diamond right now.\n\n38:14.240 --> 38:17.240\nSo we were all in our little swimsuits.\n\n38:17.240 --> 38:19.200\nAnd everyone had a spoon.\n\n38:19.200 --> 38:20.600\nAnd it was just like a food fight.\n\n38:20.600 --> 38:22.120\nIt was just like someone yelled, like, go.\n\n38:22.120 --> 38:25.640\nAnd we all just fucking threw a shitload of food at each other.\n\n38:25.640 --> 38:29.480\nAnd it was just like the simplest, dumbest, happiest\n\n38:29.480 --> 38:30.160\nI've ever been.\n\n38:30.160 --> 38:35.200\nSo I think that if Paul Shear showed up at that moment,\n\n38:35.200 --> 38:36.000\nnaked.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nAs a five-year-old?\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:39.160\nNo, as an adult, I think.\n\n38:39.160 --> 38:40.440\nAll right.\n\n38:40.440 --> 38:41.040\nYeah.\n\n38:41.040 --> 38:42.680\nLike current Paul, right?\n\n38:42.680 --> 38:45.600\nYeah, current Paul, full throttle.\n\n38:45.600 --> 38:46.960\nLike super hard.\n\n38:46.960 --> 38:52.000\nWell, and I mean, yeah, as long as no metal was exposed,\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:53.160\nI could probably time travel.\n\n38:53.160 --> 38:56.840\nBut now as an adult, I do have a metal rod in my penis\n\n38:56.840 --> 38:58.040\nto keep it hard all the time.\n\n38:58.040 --> 39:01.760\nSo a metal would prevent you from time traveling?\n\n39:01.760 --> 39:02.720\nIt isn't exposed.\n\n39:02.720 --> 39:04.400\nIt's not like at the fucking airport.\n\n39:04.400 --> 39:07.560\nThat's always been a weird thing about Terminator.\n\n39:07.560 --> 39:09.280\nIt was good enough for the first Terminator movie.\n\n39:09.280 --> 39:09.920\nIt was kind of cool.\n\n39:09.920 --> 39:12.120\nIt was like, well, why would he look like Arnold Schwarzenegger?\n\n39:12.120 --> 39:15.240\nAnd the reason is because living mechanical things, she.\n\n39:15.240 --> 39:16.280\nThe living tissue, yeah, covered it up.\n\n39:16.280 --> 39:20.320\nBut then after you were 11, you were like, well, but come on.\n\n39:20.320 --> 39:23.120\nYeah, he's still a giant robot underneath there.\n\n39:23.120 --> 39:24.120\nLike why would that matter?\n\n39:24.120 --> 39:25.280\nWhy don't you just like, yeah.\n\n39:25.280 --> 39:27.680\nWell, in this last movie, his hand is ripped off.\n\n39:27.680 --> 39:29.600\nHe's like, oh, yeah, I can't time travel because now you\n\n39:29.600 --> 39:32.320\ncan see it.\n\n39:32.320 --> 39:33.040\nI believe you.\n\n39:33.040 --> 39:33.540\nReally?\n\n39:33.540 --> 39:34.040\nYeah.\n\n39:34.040 --> 39:34.680\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n39:34.680 --> 39:36.360\nThat's the whole conceit is that he's\n\n39:36.360 --> 39:37.920\ngot to wait around for 30 years.\n\n39:37.920 --> 39:42.600\nThat's how the Terminator gets older is he's like, I'll wait here.\n\n39:42.600 --> 39:45.720\nAnd then how did this get off of little kids in bathing suits\n\n39:45.720 --> 39:46.720\nwith mashed potatoes?\n\n39:46.720 --> 39:47.720\nHow did we get off of that?\n\n39:47.720 --> 39:50.440\nCan we fucking stick to one side?\n\n39:50.440 --> 39:50.940\nSorry.\n\n39:50.940 --> 39:51.880\nYeah, sorry.\n\n39:51.880 --> 39:53.000\nWe said no tangents.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:53.720\nWe said no tangents.\n\n39:53.720 --> 39:56.800\nOK, no tangents for the whole show or just this question?\n\n39:56.800 --> 40:00.800\nThat's the rule of Harmontown is no tangents.\n\n40:00.800 --> 40:02.920\nMashed potato birthday party.\n\n40:02.920 --> 40:05.680\nI'm there as a naked adult rock hard.\n\n40:05.680 --> 40:10.680\nBut what I would like to not see it coming,\n\n40:10.680 --> 40:13.880\nI would like for you to just sort of materialize behind me\n\n40:13.880 --> 40:17.560\nwith a fucking huge hatchet.\n\n40:17.560 --> 40:22.200\nAnd just fucking slice me down the brain.\n\n40:22.200 --> 40:26.000\nMy parents and everyone's like, what the fuck?\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:29.840\nBut it would be a service to me because my life wasn't\n\n40:29.840 --> 40:32.800\ngoing to get any better than that, you know?\n\n40:32.800 --> 40:33.680\nNot at all.\n\n40:33.680 --> 40:34.880\nSo thank you.\n\n40:34.880 --> 40:39.160\nDo you guys think they're, I was going to say they say.\n\n40:39.160 --> 40:39.680\nWell done.\n\n40:39.680 --> 40:42.240\nI don't know who they are, but I heard somewhere,\n\n40:42.240 --> 40:44.840\nand it was probably an eighth grade history teacher,\n\n40:44.840 --> 40:48.120\nthat the guillotine is like the most humane execution\n\n40:48.120 --> 40:49.080\nwe've come up with so far.\n\n40:49.080 --> 40:49.960\nThat's what they say, right?\n\n40:49.960 --> 40:54.880\nBecause the speed that it goes down, all you feel is a,\n\n40:54.880 --> 40:55.960\nwho knows this?\n\n40:55.960 --> 40:56.520\nWho studies this?\n\n40:56.520 --> 40:57.480\nBut by the way, it seems.\n\n40:57.480 --> 40:59.400\nYou feel a coldness on the back of your neck\n\n40:59.400 --> 41:00.040\nand then it's done.\n\n41:00.040 --> 41:03.760\nI feel like that, if we ever did that, though, now,\n\n41:03.760 --> 41:05.560\nit would be viewed as the most inhumane.\n\n41:05.560 --> 41:07.080\nOh yeah, well, it looks terrible.\n\n41:07.080 --> 41:07.960\nWell, they also say.\n\n41:07.960 --> 41:09.960\nThe thing we do to them, lethal injection, is like,\n\n41:09.960 --> 41:10.880\nyou know, worse.\n\n41:10.880 --> 41:11.600\nIt's terrible.\n\n41:11.600 --> 41:13.000\nThey're experiencing a terrible thing.\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:16.360\nThat drowning is like pretty fucking cool.\n\n41:16.360 --> 41:16.860\nReally?\n\n41:16.860 --> 41:17.360\nYeah.\n\n41:17.360 --> 41:18.240\nAre you serious?\n\n41:18.240 --> 41:19.240\nI thought I got it right.\n\n41:19.240 --> 41:20.240\nNo fucking way, man.\n\n41:20.240 --> 41:21.240\nI thought it's just like.\n\n41:21.240 --> 41:22.760\nI'd rather burn to death.\n\n41:22.760 --> 41:23.880\nOh, water.\n\n41:23.880 --> 41:26.920\nYou know, it's just like, well, but what about the,\n\n41:26.920 --> 41:28.000\nwhat about the writhing?\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.880\nI'm like, oh, God, oh, that part of me.\n\n41:30.880 --> 41:34.000\nFor me, if I had to pick firing squad all the way, firing squad.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:34.920\nI want drums.\n\n41:34.920 --> 41:35.560\nI want dudes.\n\n41:35.560 --> 41:36.880\nLike, I want guys in keppies.\n\n41:36.880 --> 41:37.760\nThat's fucking insane.\n\n41:37.760 --> 41:38.440\nAnd I think you're lying.\n\n41:38.440 --> 41:40.400\nI want Claude Reigns to be out there in front.\n\n41:40.400 --> 41:41.960\nThey go, do you have any less words?\n\n41:41.960 --> 41:44.200\nAnd I go, up your butt with a coconut.\n\n41:44.200 --> 41:47.760\nAnd then they put the blindfold on me and they would shoot me.\n\n41:47.760 --> 41:50.080\nAnd then have bolts of lead fly through the air\n\n41:50.080 --> 41:53.360\nat the speed of sound to go into random parts of your body.\n\n41:53.360 --> 41:56.360\nIf you've ever seen firing squad footage of people dying,\n\n41:56.360 --> 41:58.800\nthey go, boom, and the person's head goes,\n\n41:58.800 --> 42:00.960\nand that's it, they're fucking, they're clearly dead,\n\n42:00.960 --> 42:02.160\nright off the bat.\n\n42:02.160 --> 42:03.600\nIsn't the whole thing of the firing squad\n\n42:03.600 --> 42:05.600\nthat only one person has a bullet,\n\n42:05.600 --> 42:07.000\nbut they're all aiming at your head?\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:08.480\nNo, no, no, no, it's the other way around.\n\n42:08.480 --> 42:12.160\nThere's a blank that everyone gets to assume is there.\n\n42:12.160 --> 42:15.240\nYou might have the blank, you might not have been the one.\n\n42:15.240 --> 42:15.800\nGot it.\n\n42:15.800 --> 42:17.320\nI like your way better though.\n\n42:17.320 --> 42:21.600\nIt's just like, one guy just sucks.\n\n42:21.600 --> 42:24.360\nYou shot him in the shoulder, you asshole.\n\n42:24.360 --> 42:27.560\nYou always get to go home at night from your work a day\n\n42:27.560 --> 42:29.680\njob on the firing squad.\n\n42:29.680 --> 42:31.120\nHow was work today, honey?\n\n42:31.120 --> 42:32.360\nI had the blank again.\n\n42:32.360 --> 42:33.280\nI had the blank in there.\n\n42:33.280 --> 42:36.280\nOh, sweetie, that's great because you know how much\n\n42:36.280 --> 42:39.160\nmy parents disapprove of your job.\n\n42:39.160 --> 42:42.560\nYeah, tell them three weeks and running.\n\n42:42.560 --> 42:45.240\nI guess I'm just born for this job.\n\n42:45.240 --> 42:48.720\nPlease stop telling your parents what I do for a living.\n\n42:48.720 --> 42:51.400\nEach firing squad guy has on the door of his locker.\n\n42:51.400 --> 42:55.280\nThey all have the blank days since the last fatality.\n\n42:55.280 --> 42:59.000\nA sign and all of them say $500,000\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:00.840\nbecause they all keep insisting they have them.\n\n43:00.840 --> 43:01.840\nThey're all super lucky.\n\n43:01.840 --> 43:03.240\nEach one of them is telling you, yeah,\n\n43:03.240 --> 43:04.240\nI just always get the blank.\n\n43:04.240 --> 43:04.840\nI don't know.\n\n43:04.840 --> 43:06.200\nSure you did, Tony.\n\n43:06.200 --> 43:07.120\nSure you did.\n\n43:07.120 --> 43:10.880\nAnd then Kevin walks away and is like, it was me.\n\n43:10.880 --> 43:13.360\nThey all go to P.F. Chang's afterward and they just like,\n\n43:13.360 --> 43:15.880\nthey joke about, you guys killed so many people.\n\n43:15.880 --> 43:18.720\nNo, you did.\n\n43:18.720 --> 43:19.960\nI never have.\n\n43:19.960 --> 43:23.200\nMe neither, ha-ha, more than one tons.\n\n43:23.200 --> 43:26.040\nThe Bullet Fairy visits one of them in the middle of the night.\n\n43:26.040 --> 43:28.480\nIt's like a Christmas carol, but for executioner.\n\n43:28.480 --> 43:30.200\nAnd like, you did kill all these people.\n\n43:30.200 --> 43:31.200\nLet's look at their lives.\n\n43:31.200 --> 43:33.600\nAnd then you, you know, then you kill yourself at the end.\n\n43:33.600 --> 43:35.080\nIt's a really dark Christmas carol.\n\n43:35.080 --> 43:36.680\nBut then you get the blank.\n\n43:36.680 --> 43:38.240\nYeah, then you get the blank.\n\n43:38.240 --> 43:42.400\nAnd then you live the best life ever.\n\n43:42.400 --> 43:44.520\nI still think a great way to die would\n\n43:44.520 --> 43:47.920\nKraken would be death by Kraken.\n\n43:47.920 --> 43:49.600\nDeath by Kraken.\n\n43:49.600 --> 43:51.720\nI was going to say a base jumping accident.\n\n43:51.720 --> 43:53.800\nLike, have you seen any of those documentaries where,\n\n43:53.800 --> 43:56.160\nyou know, they're in like those squirrel suits.\n\n43:56.160 --> 43:58.560\nJust going like 600 miles an hour.\n\n43:58.560 --> 44:01.480\nNot actual squirrel suits, but like, you mean like the flanks.\n\n44:01.480 --> 44:02.480\nYeah, those wing suits.\n\n44:02.480 --> 44:04.600\nThey're not dressed like squirrels.\n\n44:04.600 --> 44:07.760\nWell, they look sort of like squirrels.\n\n44:07.760 --> 44:09.200\nBut no, specifically, yeah.\n\n44:09.200 --> 44:10.360\nThey do look like squirrels.\n\n44:10.360 --> 44:11.640\nLike, yeah.\n\n44:11.640 --> 44:13.560\nAnd they go like real close to like the mountain.\n\n44:13.560 --> 44:14.280\nTo the terrain.\n\n44:14.280 --> 44:16.840\nYeah, and every now and then there's just like a guy that just,\n\n44:16.840 --> 44:19.200\nit's just like fucking pink mist.\n\n44:19.200 --> 44:24.520\nIt's just like, it's just like just pink mist.\n\n44:24.520 --> 44:26.520\nThat's just like terrible.\n\n44:26.520 --> 44:27.640\nThere's so fast.\n\n44:27.640 --> 44:28.440\nThere's our band name.\n\n44:28.440 --> 44:29.840\nThat's so disturbing.\n\n44:29.840 --> 44:30.640\nPink mist.\n\n44:30.640 --> 44:31.680\nIt's just so fast.\n\n44:31.680 --> 44:34.720\nI think that's the title of the episode.\n\n44:34.720 --> 44:37.720\nRefreshing Pink Mist.\n\n44:37.720 --> 44:39.560\nThe effervescence.\n\n44:39.560 --> 44:41.520\nThe good people of the Coca-Cola Corporation\n\n44:41.520 --> 44:45.480\nhave captured the flavor and impulsiveness\n\n44:45.480 --> 44:48.320\nof an extreme sportsman.\n\n44:48.320 --> 44:49.560\nAerosol misting.\n\n44:49.560 --> 44:51.280\nIt will shoot your head right off.\n\n44:51.280 --> 44:53.200\nAll right, now, Paul, you said Kraken,\n\n44:53.200 --> 44:56.080\nif you could either die or kill somebody,\n\n44:56.080 --> 44:59.560\nbut the magic was involved, you could be the murderer.\n\n44:59.560 --> 45:01.400\nOK, how about this?\n\n45:01.400 --> 45:04.000\nYou get to kill Dan Harmon because you have to.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:05.960\nBecause maybe he's going to do some terrible thing.\n\n45:05.960 --> 45:06.920\nHe's Hitler.\n\n45:06.920 --> 45:07.760\nThe new Hitler.\n\n45:07.760 --> 45:10.560\nYou have to kill Dan Harmon because he's\n\n45:10.560 --> 45:13.880\ngoing to, throughout history, be one of the worst\n\n45:13.880 --> 45:15.360\npeople that ever existed.\n\n45:15.360 --> 45:16.840\nI'm going to do a whole concert about how\n\n45:16.840 --> 45:19.080\nI want to get killed by a black woman, for instance.\n\n45:19.080 --> 45:19.640\nReally, all right.\n\n45:19.640 --> 45:22.280\nYeah, so if you want to stop that, you better kill me.\n\n45:22.280 --> 45:25.080\nNow, you live in a world, Paul, where there's magic.\n\n45:25.080 --> 45:26.080\nYou have spells.\n\n45:26.080 --> 45:27.160\nYou can do anything you want.\n\n45:27.160 --> 45:28.400\nOr you could be as crude.\n\n45:28.400 --> 45:32.400\nIt could be a nighttime attack with a bottle opener.\n\n45:32.400 --> 45:33.720\nYou could do anything you wanted.\n\n45:33.720 --> 45:36.440\nOr there could be magic spells.\n\n45:36.440 --> 45:37.840\nWell, my first instinct, I'm going\n\n45:37.840 --> 45:39.120\nto go with my first instinct here.\n\n45:39.120 --> 45:41.680\nWhen you said magic, I said voodoo dolls\n\n45:41.680 --> 45:45.040\ndon't get enough play in this world.\n\n45:45.040 --> 45:47.840\nAnd I think that would be a real fun way\n\n45:47.840 --> 45:50.280\nto get in someone's head, where they don't know what's\n\n45:50.280 --> 45:50.780\ngoing on.\n\n45:50.780 --> 45:52.120\nBut their hands are like, ugh.\n\n45:52.120 --> 45:53.560\nAnd they could have them choke themselves.\n\n45:53.560 --> 45:55.080\nYou could light that on fire.\n\n45:55.080 --> 45:59.360\nYou could make them walk into a wall.\n\n45:59.360 --> 46:01.400\nI never understood that science, yeah.\n\n46:01.400 --> 46:03.080\nLike in the Disney movies, when they eventually\n\n46:03.080 --> 46:04.360\nthey're taking the doll and going like that.\n\n46:04.360 --> 46:05.560\nAnd the guy's like moonwalking.\n\n46:05.560 --> 46:06.360\nBut it's like, well, wait.\n\n46:06.360 --> 46:07.760\nHow come every time you move it around,\n\n46:07.760 --> 46:09.840\nhe doesn't like float around?\n\n46:09.840 --> 46:11.680\nI guess you have to activate it in some way.\n\n46:11.680 --> 46:15.600\nYeah, I think a voodoo doll, and you could prolong it a little.\n\n46:15.600 --> 46:17.640\nBut you could make it a little weird.\n\n46:17.640 --> 46:19.280\nHow do you start toying with the voodoo doll?\n\n46:19.280 --> 46:21.200\nAnd then how do you finally finish the job?\n\n46:21.200 --> 46:22.720\nWell, I think in the beginning, it\n\n46:22.720 --> 46:25.600\nwould just be simple slaps in the face.\n\n46:25.600 --> 46:27.920\nAnd just general like a real thing.\n\n46:27.920 --> 46:29.680\nThis is a Total Adam Sandler movie.\n\n46:29.680 --> 46:32.480\nHa, ha, ha, ha.\n\n46:32.480 --> 46:34.240\nOh, then that would get a remote control\n\n46:34.240 --> 46:37.040\nthat would control your life and fast forward rewind.\n\n46:37.040 --> 46:42.040\n50 Nights in Haiti.\n\n46:42.040 --> 46:43.800\nWhy is that old?\n\n46:43.800 --> 46:46.280\nThat was the weirdest groan I've ever heard in my life.\n\n46:46.280 --> 46:47.880\nWell, because I think people know, oh,\n\n46:47.880 --> 46:50.240\nsomething bad happened in Haiti.\n\n46:50.240 --> 46:52.520\nEven though that's years ago.\n\n46:52.520 --> 46:58.000\nOr every day to the point where, I mean, who's going to Haiti\n\n46:58.000 --> 46:58.280\nthis week?\n\n46:58.280 --> 47:00.160\nI don't know what they think is the worst part.\n\n47:00.160 --> 47:01.720\nAs an audience, you all didn't.\n\n47:01.720 --> 47:03.640\nYou all are like, oh, too soon.\n\n47:03.640 --> 47:06.640\nToo soon to rag on an Adam Sandler movie?\n\n47:06.640 --> 47:07.600\nNo, they like that.\n\n47:07.600 --> 47:09.520\nI said, it was the word Haiti.\n\n47:09.520 --> 47:14.320\nThey reacted to it like it was like building seven or something.\n\n47:14.320 --> 47:15.160\nMe, what, building seven?\n\n47:15.160 --> 47:16.800\nNo reaction, not even a bad one.\n\n47:16.800 --> 47:17.400\nLike, yeah, yeah.\n\n47:17.400 --> 47:18.400\nLook it up.\n\n47:18.400 --> 47:21.000\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:24.360\nSo yeah, I think you would start to build the craziness\n\n47:24.360 --> 47:27.080\nin with the slaps, weird things like all of a sudden,\n\n47:27.080 --> 47:28.880\nyou're laying in bed and you're like, shoot up.\n\n47:28.880 --> 47:30.960\nAnd like, I don't know why I can't lay down.\n\n47:30.960 --> 47:37.160\nLike, to really a week full of just funny, weird slapstick.\n\n47:37.160 --> 47:39.760\nAnd then, you know, walking into walls and stuff like that.\n\n47:39.760 --> 47:44.320\nAnd then I think it would be, I would light a fire,\n\n47:44.320 --> 47:45.320\nthen I put it on ice.\n\n47:45.320 --> 47:47.000\nAnd I think those sensations, I'd go\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.120\nthrough sensations, a lot of sensations.\n\n47:49.120 --> 47:52.360\nAnd then, to talk about drowning, is Daniel-\n\n47:52.360 --> 47:55.520\nSo if you had to kill me, you'd torture me.\n\n47:58.520 --> 48:00.000\nWell, look, we're talking about you're\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:01.240\na pretty evil guy.\n\n48:01.240 --> 48:03.360\nAnd I want to make sure you get your just deserve.\n\n48:03.360 --> 48:04.880\nI don't want to make sure that, you know,\n\n48:04.880 --> 48:06.080\nI don't want to make it easy on you.\n\n48:06.080 --> 48:07.600\nIf you were like, I have to kill you\n\n48:07.600 --> 48:10.160\nto save the life of a child, yeah, guillotine.\n\n48:10.160 --> 48:12.520\nBut if you're going to be like the next whatever,\n\n48:12.520 --> 48:16.080\nyou know, Boko Haram, I need to make sure that you take-\n\n48:16.080 --> 48:18.080\nFrom Haiti?\n\n48:18.080 --> 48:18.580\nOoh.\n\n48:23.360 --> 48:25.760\nYeah, so then I would, then I think the final thing\n\n48:25.760 --> 48:27.880\nwould submerge the guy.\n\n48:27.880 --> 48:30.120\nI don't understand why me being more evil requires\n\n48:30.120 --> 48:31.320\nme to suffer longer.\n\n48:31.320 --> 48:33.800\nDon't you think that you would want to suffer?\n\n48:33.800 --> 48:34.600\nYou're saying that you do.\n\n48:34.600 --> 48:36.680\nBut you don't even know what I've done yet, first of all.\n\n48:36.680 --> 48:37.180\nWhy me?\n\n48:37.180 --> 48:38.920\nOK, Dan, I know we're learning is the-\n\n48:38.920 --> 48:39.920\nDan, counterpoint.\n\n48:39.920 --> 48:41.200\nI want to put a doll of him.\n\n48:41.200 --> 48:42.080\nHe's a torturer.\n\n48:42.080 --> 48:44.600\nHow do you kill Paul Scher?\n\n48:44.600 --> 48:47.480\nIt's hard to not just do another voodoo doll on him,\n\n48:47.480 --> 48:50.360\nyou know, so that whenever I feel like my knee get hot,\n\n48:50.360 --> 48:54.160\nI can pull out it and go like yank on his dick or something.\n\n48:54.160 --> 48:54.660\nYeah.\n\n48:54.660 --> 49:00.060\nAnd then slow down the yanking and make it more gentle\n\n49:00.060 --> 49:03.740\nto the extent that the heat on my knee was more comfortable.\n\n49:03.740 --> 49:06.860\nAnd then we'd find an understanding.\n\n49:06.860 --> 49:09.260\nI mean, but let's turn this into a win.\n\n49:09.260 --> 49:11.260\nHurt each other enough.\n\n49:11.260 --> 49:13.180\nWe can just go to restaurants together and just-\n\n49:13.180 --> 49:16.060\nNow that's an Adam Sandler movie.\n\n49:16.060 --> 49:17.420\nNow we're talking.\n\n49:17.420 --> 49:18.420\nIn Haiti.\n\n49:18.420 --> 49:23.300\nIt's called, Haiti's going to hate.\n\n49:27.780 --> 49:30.340\nNobody grown that?\n\n49:30.340 --> 49:32.180\nBut there should be a company that does that.\n\n49:32.180 --> 49:33.860\nI don't get why there isn't like,\n\n49:33.860 --> 49:35.460\nif you find out that you're dying,\n\n49:35.460 --> 49:37.220\nlike there should be a company that says,\n\n49:37.220 --> 49:38.780\nOK, well, like, how do you want to die?\n\n49:38.780 --> 49:41.060\nLike, you want to get fucking eaten by a bear?\n\n49:41.060 --> 49:42.140\nGreat, we'll set that up.\n\n49:42.140 --> 49:44.740\nLike, yeah, we'll set it up like whatever you want.\n\n49:44.740 --> 49:46.980\nYou want to be shot in like a dry body?\n\n49:46.980 --> 49:48.780\nBut wouldn't you want to, like, in a way,\n\n49:48.780 --> 49:51.020\nI think this is maybe a Dennis Leary bit.\n\n49:51.020 --> 49:53.660\nSo Dennis Leary, Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll,\n\n49:53.660 --> 49:54.220\nI'll give this to you.\n\n49:54.220 --> 49:56.460\nBut why don't you use these people?\n\n49:56.460 --> 50:00.900\nWere you just doing a shout out to an FX show?\n\n50:00.900 --> 50:05.180\nSex, Drugs, Rock and Roll.\n\n50:05.180 --> 50:10.580\nI think his name in that show is like Steve Rock and Roll.\n\n50:10.580 --> 50:13.660\nHis last name is pretty amazing.\n\n50:13.660 --> 50:15.260\nSo I would do it like you would just\n\n50:15.260 --> 50:17.300\ngo out like in a stunt from Fast and Furious.\n\n50:17.300 --> 50:18.140\nLike, that would be great.\n\n50:18.140 --> 50:19.460\nLike, sell your body to a movie.\n\n50:19.460 --> 50:21.940\nLike, yeah, you fucking get to drive Vin Diesel's car\n\n50:21.940 --> 50:23.700\nthrough those buildings in Abu Dhabi.\n\n50:23.700 --> 50:25.100\nLike, I would be.\n\n50:25.100 --> 50:26.020\nI would go out like that.\n\n50:26.020 --> 50:29.020\nLike, if you could arrange to have an on-screen fatality.\n\n50:29.020 --> 50:29.980\nYeah, like that.\n\n50:29.980 --> 50:30.380\nYeah.\n\n50:30.380 --> 50:31.700\nAnd that they would put it in the movie.\n\n50:31.700 --> 50:32.780\nExactly.\n\n50:32.780 --> 50:35.660\nLike, you get so straight in for like all old people\n\n50:35.660 --> 50:37.020\nthat are ready to die.\n\n50:42.020 --> 50:43.300\nJumping out of cars.\n\n50:43.300 --> 50:48.020\nPut the, on your new headstone, there's a video screen,\n\n50:48.020 --> 50:49.820\nlike an afford explorer.\n\n50:49.820 --> 50:52.140\nAnd it's just like a loop of the fucking like.\n\n50:52.140 --> 50:52.940\nOh, that would be the best.\n\n50:52.940 --> 50:54.980\nThis Ferrari going through.\n\n50:54.980 --> 50:57.220\nAnd then people could start going, well, shit,\n\n50:57.220 --> 50:59.380\nlet's make like a Milo and Otis movie with old people.\n\n51:01.780 --> 51:03.780\nBecause they had to kill like a million dogs and cats\n\n51:03.780 --> 51:04.540\nto make that movie.\n\n51:04.540 --> 51:07.980\nThat would be the story of two old people crossing the country\n\n51:07.980 --> 51:09.100\nto get back to their owner.\n\n51:09.100 --> 51:11.460\nAnd then it's just like an old lady in a box going down a river\n\n51:11.460 --> 51:12.820\nand like, whoa, help me.\n\n51:12.820 --> 51:15.620\nAnd it's like, you can see the different actors in each cut\n\n51:15.620 --> 51:17.060\nin each shot.\n\n51:17.060 --> 51:19.380\nAnd it's like, wow, 45.\n\n51:19.380 --> 51:20.500\nI love that.\n\n51:20.500 --> 51:21.220\nI'm in.\n\n51:21.220 --> 51:22.100\nYes.\n\n51:22.100 --> 51:24.060\nHollywood make that happen.\n\n51:24.060 --> 51:26.460\nAll people were hurt during the making of this film.\n\n51:26.460 --> 51:27.140\nEveryone.\n\n51:27.140 --> 51:29.820\nAnd then there's like a gray ribbon or whatever\n\n51:29.820 --> 51:30.700\nthe symbol for it is.\n\n51:30.700 --> 51:31.980\nIt's like, they wanted to be.\n\n51:31.980 --> 51:32.620\nYeah, they wanted to be.\n\n51:32.620 --> 51:34.100\nThey wanted to go out there, tired of being\n\n51:34.100 --> 51:35.780\ndicked around by pharmaceutical companies.\n\n51:35.780 --> 51:37.780\nAnd they were like, can I be in a kick-ass movie with Vin\n\n51:37.780 --> 51:40.100\nDiesel about me fucking braving the rapids?\n\n51:40.100 --> 51:43.980\nYeah, be the best.\n\n51:43.980 --> 51:47.180\nWere there really a lot of cats and dogs killed in the making\n\n51:47.180 --> 51:47.680\nof it?\n\n51:47.680 --> 51:50.260\nI haven't looked it up on Snopes, but I do believe.\n\n51:50.260 --> 51:51.020\nI mean, that is the.\n\n51:51.020 --> 51:52.100\nYou have to believe it.\n\n51:52.100 --> 51:53.220\nYeah, right?\n\n51:53.220 --> 51:55.780\nI think it was a Japanese production or something\n\n51:55.780 --> 51:56.460\nlike that.\n\n51:56.460 --> 51:59.020\nThere's got to be a Milo notice expert in here, right?\n\n51:59.020 --> 52:01.460\nWell, I also heard that Dudley Moore would strangle a dog\n\n52:01.460 --> 52:03.260\nevery time he did voiceover work for it.\n\n52:03.260 --> 52:04.740\nWould you mind coming up?\n\n52:04.740 --> 52:06.940\nOh, well, you had, well, two.\n\n52:06.940 --> 52:08.300\nWe've got two.\n\n52:08.300 --> 52:09.180\nTwo guys and one.\n\n52:09.180 --> 52:10.900\nSitting right next to each other.\n\n52:10.900 --> 52:12.940\nLet's bring them both up, and they both have to come up.\n\n52:12.940 --> 52:16.260\nWell, let's let the first guy, his hand was up first.\n\n52:16.260 --> 52:18.940\nNo, you, sir, yes, please, if you're willing.\n\n52:18.940 --> 52:20.060\nOK, great.\n\n52:20.060 --> 52:22.620\nAnd if he's, you know, we'll let you mean\n\n52:22.620 --> 52:24.180\ngenome, like a professional wrestler.\n\n52:24.180 --> 52:26.260\nTake the chair from your beard, sir.\n\n52:26.260 --> 52:28.540\nAll right, so what have you heard about Milo notice,\n\n52:28.540 --> 52:29.220\nand what do you know?\n\n52:29.220 --> 52:30.820\nAnd first up, what's your name?\n\n52:30.820 --> 52:31.220\nAdam.\n\n52:31.220 --> 52:31.940\nHello, Adam.\n\n52:31.940 --> 52:33.540\nHi, nice to meet you, everybody.\n\n52:33.540 --> 52:35.220\nLet me regale you all with the heart where we stand.\n\n52:35.220 --> 52:36.780\nDid you get everybody's name?\n\n52:36.780 --> 52:39.140\nYou, sir, you, sir.\n\n52:39.140 --> 52:41.380\nYeah, this was messed up, especially\n\n52:41.380 --> 52:43.060\nbecause I love this movie, know, as a kid.\n\n52:43.060 --> 52:44.580\nAnd then you grow up, and you find out\n\n52:44.580 --> 52:47.340\nthat this Japanese company, not only did they, like,\n\n52:47.340 --> 52:49.260\nliterally the scene where the cat, like, falls out,\n\n52:49.260 --> 52:51.820\nthey were just taking cats and just throwing it off this cliff.\n\n52:51.820 --> 52:54.340\nJust to get this shot, and you see the cats, like, ah, not good.\n\n52:54.340 --> 52:55.180\nDo it again.\n\n52:55.180 --> 52:56.780\nBut, like, wait, what do you mean you see?\n\n52:56.780 --> 52:57.260\nYou see footage?\n\n52:57.260 --> 52:59.700\nLike, you see in the movie, you see the cat falling off\n\n52:59.700 --> 53:01.620\nthe cliff, and it's like, literally, what they did\n\n53:01.620 --> 53:03.900\nwas they just took live cats and threw them off a cliff\n\n53:03.900 --> 53:04.580\ntill they got the shot.\n\n53:04.580 --> 53:05.620\nBut you heard that.\n\n53:05.620 --> 53:06.660\nI just want to, like, track down.\n\n53:06.660 --> 53:08.060\nYeah, I heard the same thing.\n\n53:08.060 --> 53:11.180\nBut do you know how credible is that information?\n\n53:11.180 --> 53:15.020\nIt's Dudley Moore, who did the voiceover for it,\n\n53:15.020 --> 53:16.820\nadmitted that it's one of his biggest regrets\n\n53:16.820 --> 53:19.140\nthat he was a part of the project when that came out.\n\n53:19.140 --> 53:21.260\nLike, not as, like, he, literally.\n\n53:21.260 --> 53:23.780\nIt is still, there's still a sliver of possibility\n\n53:23.780 --> 53:27.580\nthat Dudley Moore was simply told as same as I was.\n\n53:27.580 --> 53:28.700\nBecause he wasn't there.\n\n53:28.700 --> 53:30.860\nIt's like, like, he was, like, Dudley, stand in the bushes\n\n53:30.860 --> 53:33.660\nand be the voice of the cat, and he was like.\n\n53:33.660 --> 53:34.500\nAnd by the way.\n\n53:34.500 --> 53:36.900\nWhat are they doing over there?\n\n53:36.900 --> 53:38.740\nOh, pull-ups.\n\n53:38.740 --> 53:42.380\nI think if he was to look back at the mass execution\n\n53:42.380 --> 53:45.180\nof cats and dogs, and Arthur, too, maybe he would think.\n\n53:45.180 --> 53:46.500\nYeah, he would have, he would have waited.\n\n53:46.500 --> 53:48.020\nArthur, too, on the rocks, maybe.\n\n53:48.020 --> 53:50.300\nHey, brother, can you spare a billion dollars?\n\n53:50.300 --> 53:52.300\nThat's a sign on the poster.\n\n53:52.300 --> 53:54.820\nBut, but, yeah, I mean, I just, I'm just, I'm not,\n\n53:54.820 --> 53:57.340\nI'm not trying to investigate or debunk you.\n\n53:57.340 --> 54:00.140\nI'm just curious, like, because I hear it,\n\n54:00.140 --> 54:02.260\nand then I go, like, I never know the, you know,\n\n54:02.260 --> 54:03.100\nI never know.\n\n54:03.100 --> 54:04.900\nWe thought you worked for, like, the ASPCAs.\n\n54:04.900 --> 54:07.700\nSometimes I spread shit, and then later I look it up,\n\n54:07.700 --> 54:09.820\nand I'm like, I've been spreading this shit for three years,\n\n54:09.820 --> 54:13.460\nyou know, like, and I want to, like, you know, like.\n\n54:13.460 --> 54:14.300\nTake it all back.\n\n54:14.300 --> 54:15.820\nYeah, and I can't, and I can't.\n\n54:15.820 --> 54:16.660\nIt's out there.\n\n54:16.660 --> 54:19.140\nHow do I want to die at a Japanese production company\n\n54:19.140 --> 54:21.500\nkilling me for defaming their credibility?\n\n54:21.500 --> 54:23.620\nYou know what, the fact that it wasn't made in the States\n\n54:23.620 --> 54:26.420\nmakes me think that definitely animals died.\n\n54:26.420 --> 54:27.740\nI don't know how many.\n\n54:27.740 --> 54:30.100\nLike, I just feel like, yeah, they didn't care.\n\n54:30.100 --> 54:32.180\nThere's no ASA, you know, ASCPA.\n\n54:32.180 --> 54:33.900\nI've heard, I've heard anecdotal stuff.\n\n54:33.900 --> 54:35.060\nThere's no CPAs on set.\n\n54:35.060 --> 54:38.500\nUnder the subheading of that, of that legend,\n\n54:38.500 --> 54:40.500\nwhatever, if it's true or not.\n\n54:40.500 --> 54:42.500\nOkay, we got a, we love Harmontown.\n\n54:42.500 --> 54:43.740\nWell, it's like a town meeting.\n\n54:43.740 --> 54:46.140\nWe got a research department in the audience.\n\n54:46.140 --> 54:47.340\nA.V. Club article.\n\n54:47.340 --> 54:49.180\nYes, animals were harmed.\n\n54:49.180 --> 54:52.300\n21 films and TV shows that killed or hurt animals.\n\n54:52.300 --> 54:55.500\nOh, luck killed a bunch of animals, and that's HBO.\n\n54:55.500 --> 54:58.260\nNumber one is electrocuting an elephant, 1903.\n\n54:58.260 --> 54:59.580\nOkay, snobs.\n\n54:59.580 --> 55:04.420\nOf course, that was Edison, of course.\n\n55:04.420 --> 55:06.580\nAnd then stagecoach and Ben Hur as you might imagine.\n\n55:06.580 --> 55:07.780\nJesse James, okay.\n\n55:07.780 --> 55:10.540\nBen Hur, a fucking guy dies to keep it in the picture.\n\n55:10.540 --> 55:12.340\nHeaven's Gate, 1903.\n\n55:12.340 --> 55:15.260\nI just heard that, you know,\n\n55:15.260 --> 55:16.780\nthis is a comedy show, right?\n\n55:16.780 --> 55:19.020\nIt used to be.\n\n55:19.020 --> 55:21.860\nWe just, we went down after dead animals so hard.\n\n55:21.860 --> 55:25.860\nWell, I gotta say, Haiti definitely started us off\n\n55:25.860 --> 55:27.700\non the wrong foot.\n\n55:27.700 --> 55:29.700\nMade it through Naked Man, killing a five-year-old\n\n55:29.700 --> 55:30.540\nwith a hatchet, though.\n\n55:30.540 --> 55:31.660\nThat was me.\n\n55:31.660 --> 55:33.260\nI mean, did you pull this up, sir,\n\n55:33.260 --> 55:35.100\nbecause Milo notice was on this list?\n\n55:35.100 --> 55:35.940\nCause how about?\n\n55:35.940 --> 55:36.780\nIt was fact checking.\n\n55:36.780 --> 55:37.860\nIt was fact checking.\n\n55:37.860 --> 55:41.980\nMaybe there's no relevance to Milo notice in this article.\n\n55:41.980 --> 55:44.420\nOh, the Adventures of Milo notice is number 21.\n\n55:44.420 --> 55:46.860\nAll right, originally released in Japan in 1986,\n\n55:46.860 --> 55:48.140\nthe Adventures of Milo notice depicted\n\n55:48.140 --> 55:49.220\nthe best buddies relationship.\n\n55:49.220 --> 55:52.060\nBut it's as cute as the film is.\n\n55:52.060 --> 55:54.100\nIt's been dogged by rumors of animal cruelty.\n\n55:54.100 --> 55:55.940\nDogged by rumors.\n\n55:55.940 --> 56:00.940\nA-minus AV club.\n\n56:00.940 --> 56:04.260\nJust like all my best episodes.\n\n56:04.260 --> 56:05.460\nFucking A-minus.\n\n56:05.460 --> 56:06.980\nWhat the fuck are you?\n\n56:06.980 --> 56:08.180\nThey can't give it up.\n\n56:08.180 --> 56:10.100\nThey can't give it up.\n\n56:10.100 --> 56:11.500\nThey're very hard to grade.\n\n56:11.500 --> 56:12.860\nYou know what got an A?\n\n56:12.860 --> 56:17.020\nMy last episode, they were like, yeah, get out of here.\n\n56:17.020 --> 56:18.620\nAll right, particular emphasis on a claim\n\n56:18.620 --> 56:21.980\nthat 20 kittens were killed in the course of filming.\n\n56:21.980 --> 56:23.260\nThese are still describing the rumors.\n\n56:23.260 --> 56:25.260\nThough the rumors were never substantiated animal rights\n\n56:25.260 --> 56:27.300\nat the point that the film's end credits don't use\n\n56:27.300 --> 56:30.620\nthe standard American he made association claimer.\n\n56:30.620 --> 56:34.140\nBut instead a more vague, the animals used were filmed\n\n56:34.140 --> 56:36.260\nunder strict supervision with the utmost care\n\n56:36.260 --> 56:37.620\nfor their safety and well-being.\n\n56:37.620 --> 56:41.180\nAnd their interment.\n\n56:41.180 --> 56:44.380\nRegardless of off-screen abuse, a lot of what\n\n56:44.380 --> 56:46.820\nmade it into the film meets any reasonable definition\n\n56:46.820 --> 56:48.180\nof animal cruelty.\n\n56:48.180 --> 56:49.860\nThat's a good point.\n\n56:49.860 --> 56:53.020\nEven on screen, even if they use the same cat and dog,\n\n56:53.020 --> 56:54.260\nit's like, Jesus Christ, man.\n\n56:54.260 --> 56:56.980\nDon't work them that hard.\n\n56:56.980 --> 56:58.580\nWhile some of the more harrowing scenes\n\n56:58.580 --> 57:00.300\nwere cut for US audiences, others remained,\n\n57:00.300 --> 57:02.420\nlike the one in which the cat plunges more than 100 feet\n\n57:02.420 --> 57:03.900\noff a cliff into the ocean.\n\n57:03.900 --> 57:05.540\nOther controversial scenes include.\n\n57:05.540 --> 57:07.140\nBut there's no.\n\n57:07.140 --> 57:07.940\nNo one knows.\n\n57:07.940 --> 57:08.660\nThere is no.\n\n57:08.660 --> 57:10.700\nIt's dying with those Japanese filmmakers.\n\n57:10.700 --> 57:11.860\nIt's the last one on the list.\n\n57:11.860 --> 57:14.860\nAnd they don't say that there's no reference to it.\n\n57:14.860 --> 57:17.340\nThe one that I want to look at is, I remember as a kid,\n\n57:17.340 --> 57:19.940\nand I've only been able to see images of it online,\n\n57:19.940 --> 57:21.540\nBenji at Marine World.\n\n57:21.540 --> 57:23.820\nAnd they put Benji in a wetsuit.\n\n57:23.820 --> 57:26.460\nAnd then submerged him, made him dive.\n\n57:26.460 --> 57:30.740\nSo he's wearing an old school, like 20,000 leagues\n\n57:30.740 --> 57:35.660\nunder the sea kind of helmet, like a circular fishbowl helmet.\n\n57:35.660 --> 57:38.500\nAnd he's in his own wetsuit diving.\n\n57:38.500 --> 57:41.500\nAnd I'm like, well, I know this dog is under water.\n\n57:41.500 --> 57:44.580\nAnd I don't think that wetsuits for dogs are a thing.\n\n57:44.580 --> 57:50.300\nSo I'm guessing this is inhumane.\n\n57:50.300 --> 57:51.100\nWhat was your name again, sir?\n\n57:51.100 --> 57:51.600\nSorry.\n\n57:51.600 --> 57:52.100\nAdam.\n\n57:52.100 --> 57:54.660\nAdam, and what did you, oh, shit, sorry.\n\n57:58.500 --> 58:00.940\nDo you think you have a line to any more information\n\n58:00.940 --> 58:01.780\nthan Adam had?\n\n58:01.780 --> 58:03.780\nThere's a couple more stories about it.\n\n58:03.780 --> 58:06.180\nBut like you said, everything's just still kind of covered.\n\n58:06.180 --> 58:07.420\nSo still unsubstantiated.\n\n58:07.420 --> 58:09.860\nBut what was your name, just so we can, Ben.\n\n58:09.860 --> 58:10.380\nAll right.\n\n58:10.380 --> 58:13.260\nWell, thank you, Ben and Adam, for being our Milo notice\n\n58:13.260 --> 58:14.980\ncorrespondent team.\n\n58:14.980 --> 58:19.260\nTony Macs, Tony Macs, Tony Macs.\n\n58:19.260 --> 58:21.940\nI wouldn't put that credit on your resume,\n\n58:21.940 --> 58:27.580\nthough, like, Harmontown Milo notice expert.\n\n58:27.580 --> 58:29.060\nWell, let's hope, let's hope.\n\n58:29.060 --> 58:30.820\nYou know, well, because Rob pointed out,\n\n58:30.820 --> 58:32.340\nI think it was Schrab, he's like, yeah,\n\n58:32.340 --> 58:34.740\nisn't that seen where the, like, it's part of the story\n\n58:34.740 --> 58:37.780\nthat one of the animals hurts their leg and they're limping.\n\n58:37.780 --> 58:41.460\nAnd it's like, how do you, how do you train a puppy to limp?\n\n58:41.460 --> 58:48.620\nI will say, I have worked with numerous animals\n\n58:48.620 --> 58:51.100\nand none of them can be trained.\n\n58:51.100 --> 58:53.540\nThey are all, they only have owners that promise you\n\n58:53.540 --> 58:55.060\nthat they will be able to be trained.\n\n58:55.060 --> 58:55.380\nOh, yeah.\n\n58:55.380 --> 58:57.460\nAnd then they're like, I don't know why they're not\n\n58:57.460 --> 58:59.100\ndoing it now.\n\n58:59.100 --> 59:02.460\nThey were doing it great yesterday.\n\n59:02.460 --> 59:05.260\nHeat vision and Jack, like Jack gets out of the jail cell\n\n59:05.260 --> 59:07.860\nbecause there's a German shepherd and the joke is so smart,\n\n59:07.860 --> 59:11.740\nhe can talk German shepherd through a dog whistle.\n\n59:11.740 --> 59:13.860\nAnd it's like, yeah, the guy comes in with the German shepherd\n\n59:13.860 --> 59:14.780\nand is like, this is Bucky.\n\n59:14.780 --> 59:17.940\nAnd I was like, OK, well, because it says on the script\n\n59:17.940 --> 59:19.340\nthat the dog does all this shit.\n\n59:19.340 --> 59:21.500\nAnd the guy's like, here's the three things Bucky could do.\n\n59:21.500 --> 59:22.500\nAnd then, yeah, he's like, and I've\n\n59:22.500 --> 59:24.380\nbeen working with them all week on that one thing.\n\n59:24.380 --> 59:25.260\nBut OK, let's try it.\n\n59:25.260 --> 59:26.100\nOh, all right.\n\n59:26.100 --> 59:27.340\nNope, nope, nope, nope.\n\n59:27.340 --> 59:29.900\nIt will really work if I'm in front of the dog\n\n59:29.900 --> 59:32.460\nand I have my hand on his head and I'm in the shot.\n\n59:32.460 --> 59:33.460\nWill that work for you guys?\n\n59:33.460 --> 59:36.580\nNo, absolutely not because that's not the way filming goes.\n\n59:36.580 --> 59:39.660\nWe can't have this dude who just appears\n\n59:39.660 --> 59:41.220\nto be training the dog in the scene.\n\n59:41.220 --> 59:43.580\nYeah, that's why in TV shows it's always like, if the dog growls,\n\n59:43.580 --> 59:44.460\nit's like yawning.\n\n59:44.460 --> 59:47.140\nBut then there's like, argh.\n\n59:47.140 --> 59:50.140\nYou shot a thing on the league with a monkey.\n\n59:50.140 --> 59:54.380\nAnd the guy, I was in a car, the monkey got loose in a car.\n\n59:54.380 --> 59:56.580\nAnd he goes, don't worry if the monkey starts\n\n59:56.580 --> 59:59.900\nbiting whatever the sun visor.\n\n59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.260\nHe likes that.\n\n01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.340\nAll right, all right.\n\n01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.700\nHe goes, but if he starts biting you,\n\n01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:09.180\njust give him these gummy bears and they will be fine.\n\n01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.460\nAnd my advantage was I was like, that's\n\n01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:11.860\nshit.\n\n01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.340\nI wouldn't give that to a child who's being hyper.\n\n01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:17.340\nWhy would I then provoke the monkey\n\n01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:21.220\nand then also give him something that's in the form of a human?\n\n01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.900\nI wouldn't want to get that.\n\n01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.220\nThe most important thing being like, if he bites me,\n\n01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.780\ndon't defend myself?\n\n01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.780\nYeah.\n\n01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.340\nDon't give him a treat.\n\n01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.980\nIf he reverts to his savage animal instincts\n\n01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:35.620\nand is following no programming whatsoever,\n\n01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:39.500\nI should elevate my understanding of everything\n\n01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.500\nin the universe and not react primarily.\n\n01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.100\nOn Children's Hospital, we shot this thing\n\n01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:47.060\nwith a baboon and a fucking baboon.\n\n01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.140\nThey're so scary.\n\n01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.620\nThey have the biggest fucking fangs.\n\n01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.900\nAnd they brought her in and she was dressed up\n\n01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.940\nlike Megan Mullally's character.\n\n01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:58.420\nShe was wearing a little lab coat and glasses.\n\n01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.420\nThe baboon was?\n\n01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.420\nThe baboon was, yeah.\n\n01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.500\nAnd so they had her in this chair\n\n01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:05.420\nand she was just at this desk and she was just supposed to type.\n\n01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.540\nThe joke was that we didn't know that that was not\n\n01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.420\nMegan Mullally.\n\n01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.340\nWe thought, oh, chief blah, blah, blah, we start talking to her\n\n01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.100\nand we just didn't know.\n\n01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.060\nSo the trainer, they put her in this chair\n\n01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.940\nand she would just type.\n\n01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.740\nShe would just go like on a typewriter,\n\n01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:25.660\nbut like a fucking maniac with such fucking hatred\n\n01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.780\nand anger at the world.\n\n01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:32.260\nAnd they told us right before we rolled,\n\n01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.260\nit was me and Offerman.\n\n01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.260\nMe and Offerman are supposed to be questioning the monkey,\n\n01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.260\nleaning right into her face.\n\n01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.820\nAnd they go, oh, yeah.\n\n01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.380\nDon't look at her because that's aggressive.\n\n01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.260\nSo don't look at her.\n\n01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.660\nYou can look towards her, but don't look at her.\n\n01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.780\nAnd I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:50.500\nWhat is the difference between fucking looking\n\n01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.380\ntowards this animal and looking at it?\n\n01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:57.300\nBecause I don't want to get my fucking face ripped off\n\n01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:01.500\nand like shat in and handed back to me.\n\n01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.060\nBack in New York, when we used to do stuff in New York,\n\n01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:08.260\nI believe Seth Herzog brought a monkey on stage for a bit\n\n01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:11.020\nlike at a comedy show and the monkey ripped his ear lobe off.\n\n01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.300\nWhoa.\n\n01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.940\nThese fucking things are animals.\n\n01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.740\nThey look like people, but they're animals.\n\n01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:21.860\nYou can throw your face off and rip off your balls,\n\n01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.460\nand then they'll eat your hands off.\n\n01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.820\nAnd that's not all because they're animals,\n\n01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:31.460\nbut they're animals that understand your private parts.\n\n01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.820\nLike a dog doesn't go right for your fucking nuts,\n\n01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:37.540\nbut a shrimp is like, I know exactly what you are.\n\n01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:40.020\nI am 99% identical to you genetically,\n\n01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:41.100\nand I'm angry at you.\n\n01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.380\nI know, I'm de-beat you.\n\n01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.260\nI'm going for the parts of you that get you passed.\n\n01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.300\nLiterally low hanging fruit.\n\n01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:49.700\nIt's like blah.\n\n01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:53.220\nThey go for your face and your fucking fingers\n\n01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.900\nand your genitals.\n\n01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:59.980\nThey go for what you'd go for if you have compassion.\n\n01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:01.380\nBecause that's prison fight.\n\n01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:05.260\nIf you weren't so lazy, this is what you would do.\n\n01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.980\nI remember I talked to an animal trainer who had an orangutan,\n\n01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.860\nand I was like, oh, was it like working with them?\n\n01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.820\nAnd he goes, well, my trainer, my master trainer,\n\n01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:19.180\nhad an orangutan, and he goes, once they become older,\n\n01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:20.180\nthey get more stubborn.\n\n01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.300\nAnd you have to start to watch out for these signs.\n\n01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:24.020\nAnd he goes, he was missing his mark.\n\n01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.820\nHe wasn't doing his thing, and they used to live together.\n\n01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.580\nAnd he said, I'd always say, you'd always tell a monkey,\n\n01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.540\nlike get me a beer, and the monkey would get him a beer,\n\n01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:33.180\nand then the monkey would have a beer.\n\n01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.660\nHe goes, but one day he said, get me a beer,\n\n01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.620\nand the monkey didn't get him a beer.\n\n01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:40.380\nAnd he's like, now it's time.\n\n01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.420\nAnd he goes, he walked him out into the backyard\n\n01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.340\nand shot him in the back.\n\n01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.940\nNo.\n\n01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:48.100\nNo.\n\n01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.300\nNo.\n\n01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:52.860\nBecause he said that because I believe it was an orangutan\n\n01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.220\nthat when they get to a certain age,\n\n01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.860\nlike their headaches actually grows,\n\n01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.740\nor something like that, like a bone in their head\n\n01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:02.580\nkind of pops out, and then they cannot be trained anymore.\n\n01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.900\nThen they're not, they are off the grid.\n\n01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.740\nSo you're like, and because they are domesticated\n\n01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:10.940\nand off the grid, they're doubly fucked.\n\n01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:13.340\nSo it was like, the only main thing was to shoot them.\n\n01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.300\nIt was murder.\n\n01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:17.020\nBut I love a Miller's crossing with an orangutan.\n\n01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:17.540\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:20.060\nJust walking him out and pop.\n\n01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.740\nAnd not because he didn't break his leg in a horse race.\n\n01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:23.780\nLike, that's sad enough.\n\n01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.620\nIt's like, thank you for racing and making all the money.\n\n01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:26.660\nNo, it's like, you've gone to a joint.\n\n01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.340\nIt's like, you wouldn't give me a beer.\n\n01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.180\nYou became sentient.\n\n01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:33.980\nYou are not my slave anymore, Troy.\n\n01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:36.060\nOh my god, I want to un-hear that.\n\n01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.500\nYou started to evolve.\n\n01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.620\nYou were evolving.\n\n01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.020\nThis was a guy.\n\n01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.940\nThis is an animal trainer who's master trainer.\n\n01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.620\nLike, he apprenticed under this guy\n\n01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:49.780\nand told the story very casually.\n\n01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.940\nIt wasn't like a, it wasn't like, oh,\n\n01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:54.100\nand he told me like 10 other amazing stories about it.\n\n01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.060\nHe just shot him with a gun?\n\n01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.060\nHe said like this, he goes, he walked him out in the back\n\n01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.860\nwith a gun, and poof.\n\n01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:02.060\nSo I imagine that means she knows, yeah.\n\n01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.500\nThat could mean a lot of things, though.\n\n01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.420\nThat could mean a lot.\n\n01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.540\nDan, Dan, was it Jim or Joel Hodgson that told us?\n\n01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:12.220\nI love Lancelot Link, that show with the chimpanzees.\n\n01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.340\nAnd I think it was Joel Hodgson, right, Harmon,\n\n01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:17.180\nwho told us that he knows the people that did that show.\n\n01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.460\nAnd there was these chimpanzees.\n\n01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.700\nIf you don't know Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp,\n\n01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:24.380\nit was a show where it's like a James Bond kind of thing.\n\n01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.580\nIt's very funny.\n\n01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:28.300\nAnd there was the evolution revolution with the band.\n\n01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.780\nAnd there's chimpanzees playing drums.\n\n01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:30.740\nIt's very fun.\n\n01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:32.980\nHowever, we found out from our friend Joel Hodgson\n\n01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:35.820\nfrom Mystery Science Theater fame\n\n01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:38.380\nthat part of training those chimps\n\n01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:41.140\nwas daily taking them out behind the fucking set\n\n01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:43.060\nand beating them with a pipe.\n\n01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.300\nAnd like beating them in a submission,\n\n01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.460\nbecause these chimps at some point, they get aggressive.\n\n01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.380\nAnd they're like, I don't want to do this anymore.\n\n01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:54.820\nThey're very muscular, very aggressive when they want to be.\n\n01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.940\nAnd they would have to take them out and beat them\n\n01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.540\nwithin an inch of their fucking life,\n\n01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:01.380\nlike all the time, to get them to go put a tuxedo on\n\n01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:06.100\nand pretend that they're going to put a tuxedo on.\n\n01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:08.780\nTheir wardrobe just kept getting more and more elaborate\n\n01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:11.380\nto cover up all of them.\n\n01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.860\nThere was a guy calling me at the end of it all.\n\n01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:16.060\nThey have to put their own tuxedo on that.\n\n01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.820\nThey're like, god damn it.\n\n01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.620\nTold Cindy to take this in.\n\n01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:21.740\nMakes me look like a fat ass.\n\n01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:24.580\nIf that guy beats me with a pipe one less time,\n\n01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.580\nI'm not putting it on next time.\n\n01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:30.180\nI don't know why that made me.\n\n01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:33.620\nMonkey alone in a trailer with a black eye.\n\n01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:35.260\nIt's a terrible job.\n\n01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:37.820\nYeah, you hit it with the pipe, and then you're like,\n\n01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:41.860\nnow go to your dressing room and dress like a fucking witch\n\n01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.260\ndoctor.\n\n01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.460\nAnd he's like emin and ha, and a hump,\n\n01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:49.540\nand he's just kind of got the latch on the back.\n\n01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.100\nIt's not funny if you're listening and you're\n\n01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.180\nan animal person.\n\n01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:52.940\nYeah, well, I'm not.\n\n01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.140\nYeah, we're not making fun of it.\n\n01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.140\nYeah, we're not.\n\n01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.780\nI saw on Facebook that thing where elephants are painting,\n\n01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.540\nand the elephant draws a painting of an elephant,\n\n01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.580\nand it's fucking a better elephant that you could draw.\n\n01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.380\nAnd people are like, well, that's a fucking amazing.\n\n01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:08.220\nI didn't know an elephant could put a paintbrush in its trunk\n\n01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:11.420\nand draw a fucking perfect elephant and do it.\n\n01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.820\nIt turns out the way they do that is through torture\n\n01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.380\nand through lots of like, people walk up to them\n\n01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.580\nand they hold them by the ear, but in their hands\n\n01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:21.700\nthere's a nail, and there's little sticks they have.\n\n01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.420\nIt doesn't look like it, but what they're doing\n\n01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:25.220\nis they're just jabbing them with.\n\n01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.900\nIt's all through pain that they've\n\n01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:29.860\nlearned to do this shit.\n\n01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.100\nBut are the paintings good?\n\n01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:36.500\nI mean, they're beautiful paintings.\n\n01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.420\nI would buy one of these paintings.\n\n01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.420\nYeah.\n\n01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:44.300\nI would like a movie version of The Fugitive with a monkey\n\n01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.340\nbeing like he killed a trainer, and he's like,\n\n01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:50.820\nI wrongly accused monkey being chased down.\n\n01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:54.020\nI was tired of playing the baron and putting a monocle\n\n01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:58.500\nin and riding a tricycle, and yes, I killed my trainer,\n\n01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.980\nbut it was price entertainment.\n\n01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:03.900\nBut now he's a monkey without a fucking comb.\n\n01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:08.420\nJune, my wife, is very adamant about monkey and monkey\n\n01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:11.780\nrights, because she doesn't like that monkeys are\n\n01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:15.340\nportrayed in a way that they have no control over.\n\n01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:18.460\nSo in the movie called Monkey Shines,\n\n01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:19.700\na monkey is a killer.\n\n01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.500\nAnd she's like, well, that's not fair to the monkey,\n\n01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:24.140\nbecause he can't choose his roles.\n\n01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:30.620\nAnd so he shouldn't be portraying his race\n\n01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.620\nby doing this.\n\n01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:35.900\nLike, you're forcing him into a role that is maybe not\n\n01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.140\ndefamatory to his race.\n\n01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:41.220\nBut June is paranormally empathic,\n\n01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.380\nbecause when I did your awesome podcast,\n\n01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:45.620\nHow Did This Get Made, which everybody should listen to.\n\n01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.620\nThank you so much.\n\n01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:54.020\nShe was very sincerely like Jack Frost with Michael Keaton.\n\n01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.380\nThere was a point where she was crying.\n\n01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:56.180\nYeah, she cries.\n\n01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.540\nShe cries a lot.\n\n01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.420\nYeah, she gets touched by these things.\n\n01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:03.620\nBut the monkey debate was pretty amazing.\n\n01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:08.420\nShe does not believe that dogs, monkeys, whatever,\n\n01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:10.820\nthey should have some sort of autonomy over the roles\n\n01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:11.740\nthat they are choosing.\n\n01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.700\nThat's why Blackfish is such a great movie,\n\n01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.700\nbecause you're just rooting for the killer whale.\n\n01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:16.940\nYou're like, oh, cool, man.\n\n01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.940\nYeah.\n\n01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:21.420\nCome on.\n\n01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:25.940\nIt's like these 17-year-old interns that are like,\n\n01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:27.780\nI love, I know you were doing a bit.\n\n01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:30.140\nI mean, it's not their fault.\n\n01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:33.140\nBut they're like, no, it's not that trainer's fault.\n\n01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.900\nBut I mean, you do feel for the killer whale.\n\n01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.660\nLike, you know, they've been fucking prisoner for the whole.\n\n01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.100\nYeah, but you could cut, well, why\n\n01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.060\nare we having this debate?\n\n01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:44.980\nBut if you're young enough and you're that into animals,\n\n01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.420\nyou could come out of high school and be like,\n\n01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.780\nI want to work at SeaWorld because I love the animals.\n\n01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:52.820\nAnd you don't have to have been on the boat where you're\n\n01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:54.220\npulling them out of the water.\n\n01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.300\nAnd you're just like, oh, my god, I love this whale.\n\n01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:58.340\nYou only know what you're told.\n\n01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:01.780\nThese are not top scientists that are in the pool going,\n\n01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:05.660\nhey, here's some fish waved to the crowd.\n\n01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.780\nI think the top researchers are probably\n\n01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:10.540\ndoing some other high-level shit.\n\n01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.940\nDid you guys ever, the MPR, I've already talked about this,\n\n01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.220\nbut the MPR thing about that, it's all about monkey.\n\n01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:17.380\nIt's monkey stories, chimp stories and all that stuff.\n\n01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.780\nAnd one of them is the scientist who,\n\n01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.380\nlike there was a chimp that was in the lab\n\n01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:24.980\nthat knew fluent sign language.\n\n01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.140\nAnd it was just allowed to wander around the lab.\n\n01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.980\nAnd there was a male head of the department.\n\n01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:31.980\nAnd then there was like a funding guy who came in\n\n01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:35.700\nand took him into his office and was yelling at him.\n\n01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.380\nAnd oh, no, no, no, no, I'm sorry.\n\n01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.980\nIt was the other way around.\n\n01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:41.300\nMaybe the female was the, the female scientist\n\n01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.700\nwas the head of the research department.\n\n01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:45.940\nAnd she was being yelled at by a, by a male\n\n01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:48.060\nwho was like a, like a money guy.\n\n01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.620\nI'm sure I got the story wrong.\n\n01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.260\nI also got a million things about boat trip rock.\n\n01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.620\nSo just, you always have to,\n\n01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:54.900\nyou always have to just operate on my memory and just,\n\n01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:57.380\nbut the story I remember is that the monkey is,\n\n01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:59.700\nthe chimp is sitting out there signing with the,\n\n01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:03.740\nwith a male who was like, I think a superior to the female.\n\n01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:06.700\nI have no idea if monkey, if chimps are inherently sexist\n\n01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:07.980\nand he couldn't understand the hierarchy,\n\n01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:09.820\nbut he, he had a hierarchy in his head\n\n01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:12.220\nand was signing to the male scientist.\n\n01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:17.220\nLike that, that guy's in there like, like fucking up your shit.\n\n01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.140\nLike, like he's like mistreating her.\n\n01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.220\nLike you need to go in there and bite him.\n\n01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.540\nAnd, and, and the guy's like, well, we don't,\n\n01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:24.740\nwe don't, we don't bite each other.\n\n01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:25.660\nThat's not what we do.\n\n01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.980\nAnd, and the chimps like, you got to bite him.\n\n01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:32.980\nHe's, he's, look what he's in there dissing your, your woman.\n\n01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.900\nLike, like, like he's, he's in there like fucking\n\n01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:36.820\nwith your whole thing.\n\n01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:40.540\nAnd if you don't bite him, I'll bite you.\n\n01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:41.380\nHe signed this?\n\n01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.940\nAnd the scientist was like, it was like,\n\n01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:46.260\nuh, we don't bite each other's Ralph.\n\n01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.580\nSo good day.\n\n01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.620\nAnd then like, or, or it was, you know what?\n\n01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:51.660\nIt was the other way around.\n\n01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.660\nIt was like, that's the scariest thing about it.\n\n01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.420\nI think it was the woman was signing with the chimp\n\n01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:58.100\nand the guy was, the chimp was saying to the woman,\n\n01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:01.820\ntell him to bite him or I'm going to bite him later.\n\n01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:04.540\nIn any case, there was like this elaborate conversation\n\n01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.460\nand it was like alarming.\n\n01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:08.460\nAnd then they, and then like, uh, some time went by\n\n01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:11.380\nand the male scientist was like sitting in his office.\n\n01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:14.540\nLike it's just picture, like he's just laying down.\n\n01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:17.380\nChimp was like allowed to just go wherever I wanted.\n\n01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:19.140\nAnd he just had some Xeroxes to do.\n\n01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:22.220\nAnd like, uh, like, like the, the, the chimp, I mean,\n\n01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:24.780\nand he just came in the guy's office, came across his desk\n\n01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.060\nand bit his hand.\n\n01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:27.980\nIt's so hard that he lost like three fingers.\n\n01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:29.020\nWhoa.\n\n01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.100\nAnd he, and then he went, and then he,\n\n01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.820\nand the guy was like, Jesus fucking Christ, Herman.\n\n01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.860\nI, I thought, like, what the fuck is this blood everywhere?\n\n01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:38.260\nGod, he goes and gets his fingers reattached or whatever.\n\n01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.980\nAnd then the, then the, the chimp, like after it just kept\n\n01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.780\ngoing like, where's, where's Steve?\n\n01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:44.580\nLike, like, like after he came back on there,\n\n01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:47.220\nit's like, uh, he's getting his fingers reattached.\n\n01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:49.980\nUm, and he's like, well, uh, well, where is he?\n\n01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:50.820\nWhere is he?\n\n01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:52.940\nAnd he's like, he doesn't want to work with you anymore.\n\n01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:55.780\nYou bit his hand, you fucking cocksucker.\n\n01:12:55.780 --> 01:13:01.780\nAnd he's like, uh, well, I mean, I had to.\n\n01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.500\nLike, like, he sat having a conversation.\n\n01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:04.620\nHe's like, that's what you do.\n\n01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.220\nHe was like, I had to bite his hand.\n\n01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.060\nKind of like street law, you know what I mean?\n\n01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:10.660\nAnd they said, you need to apologize to him.\n\n01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:13.380\nAnd he was like, I don't know what that means or whatever.\n\n01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:14.660\nLike the conversation was like, he,\n\n01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.180\nhe either didn't know what apologizing was\n\n01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.860\nor he was like, I'm not sorry though.\n\n01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.780\nYou know, like in either case it was like, like, but I had to.\n\n01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:23.380\nAnd then time went by and he kept going like, where's Steve?\n\n01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.660\nAnd they're like, dude, you're a fucking dick.\n\n01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.620\nLike you, you didn't, you know that you remember Steve,\n\n01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.340\nso you remember what you did.\n\n01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.660\nAnd he's like, yeah, but whatever.\n\n01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.180\nAnd then like, like all this time went by.\n\n01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:35.340\nAnd then after a while he apparently was like,\n\n01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:36.380\nokay, bring Steven here.\n\n01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.580\nAnd he gave him a hug.\n\n01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.500\nLike, like, like, he was like, all right,\n\n01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:44.020\nyou fucking pussy, now let's get to work.\n\n01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.980\nAll right, bring me another, bring me another kitten.\n\n01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:46.940\nAll right, I broke his neck.\n\n01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.380\nAll right.\n\n01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:53.140\nI want my KitKat fucking chimpanzees will rip your fuck it.\n\n01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:55.340\nThey're, they're, they are humorless,\n\n01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.980\nlike savage fucking monsters.\n\n01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:59.180\nThey have no compassion.\n\n01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:01.460\nThey're scary.\n\n01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:02.420\nThey don't look like us.\n\n01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.300\nI get it, but they're monsters.\n\n01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:05.140\nThey're terrifying.\n\n01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.140\nWell, it's tricky.\n\n01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.980\nWhen you put a cowboy hat on anybody,\n\n01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.700\nthey seem more friendly, you know.\n\n01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.540\nI know.\n\n01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.580\nAnd then we want to do that, but it's like,\n\n01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.700\nwe shouldn't be doing that.\n\n01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:13.540\nWhat are you drinking?\n\n01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.620\nWe shouldn't be, we shouldn't be dressing chimps up\n\n01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:17.700\nbecause that's what they do to us.\n\n01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.500\nThat's chimp behavior to dress up a chimp.\n\n01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.500\nDoes that make sense?\n\n01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:22.900\nIs that track?\n\n01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:23.980\nWe're going to be more human.\n\n01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.620\nThat's why it's called the humane society.\n\n01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:28.300\nLike, like being humane involves being nice to animals.\n\n01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.180\nUnless you're eating them at every meal.\n\n01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:32.540\nWell, do you, I guess the question then is,\n\n01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.900\ndoes it make sense to even train these monkeys to talk?\n\n01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:35.740\nBecause.\n\n01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:36.580\nNo, fuck no.\n\n01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.900\nWell, no, no, no, you can't, no, you should.\n\n01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:39.740\nI guess.\n\n01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:40.580\nI feel like the plan is.\n\n01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:41.420\nKeep fucking with everything.\n\n01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:42.260\nYeah, you want some too?\n\n01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:43.420\nA cup.\n\n01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.260\nSorry guys.\n\n01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.260\nYeah, I feel like the plan is to make them soldiers, right?\n\n01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.900\nLike, isn't that the idea?\n\n01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:53.300\nMan, the cold open of Lawnmower, man.\n\n01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:55.980\nThe shows you how dangerous that is.\n\n01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:56.820\nWe put some more.\n\n01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:57.660\nThere's a cold open of Lawnmower, man.\n\n01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.460\nIt's like a chimp, like a Jim Henson chimp,\n\n01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.060\nlike going through a military base,\n\n01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.860\nkilling people because it's been trained\n\n01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.380\nto do it in a video game.\n\n01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:07.220\nWell, I mean, I mean, get out.\n\n01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.060\nHe's again.\n\n01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:09.220\nJim Henson chimp.\n\n01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.820\nI talked, I talked into this.\n\n01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:13.660\nI knew I wanted to.\n\n01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:16.380\nTalk about how monkeys are so dumb.\n\n01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.580\nMonkeys don't even know how to use a microphone.\n\n01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.060\nYeah, I mean, well, I mean,\n\n01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.020\nmonkeys probably have no remorse.\n\n01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.420\nNo, I bet they don't.\n\n01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.260\nThey like.\n\n01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.700\nIt's like a terminator, like a five year old terminator\n\n01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:28.860\nwith a rock hard dick.\n\n01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:33.860\nThey, monkeys will eat baby monkeys just like for fun.\n\n01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:35.620\nI mean, not for fun.\n\n01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.340\nThey do it for war, but they'll just like,\n\n01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.580\nmonkeys will get up at like three in the morning\n\n01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.820\nand like high five each other and then go into the jungle\n\n01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:44.060\nand just eat a bunch of baby monkeys\n\n01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.780\nfrom another monkey village.\n\n01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:48.260\nBy the way, Spencer, the way that you are positioned\n\n01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:49.540\nright now and what you just said,\n\n01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:52.300\nI want to watch a, just like an Andy Rooney segment\n\n01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.660\nof just you, me like just,\n\n01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:59.660\njust melancholy about monkey, it's some cold hard facts\n\n01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:01.340\nabout monkeys.\n\n01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:05.180\nSpencer, are you pro or con monkey?\n\n01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:08.620\nI'm against, like we should not, we should not know.\n\n01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.580\nI mean, we shouldn't know about monkeys.\n\n01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.420\nWe shouldn't see monkeys.\n\n01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:12.580\nLike not know about them?\n\n01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:15.980\nNo, they should just be away from us.\n\n01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:18.580\nBecause like, yeah, they do rip people's faces off.\n\n01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:20.220\nWhy are we all like, that's pretty cool.\n\n01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.580\nLet's figure out why that happens.\n\n01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.780\nThey're ripping people's fucking faces off.\n\n01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:25.380\nWell, studying them has been pretty important\n\n01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.220\nto understanding ourselves.\n\n01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.220\nIt's dumb.\n\n01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.060\nBut I mean,\n\n01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.060\nAgain, this show is, this show is paying off huge dividends.\n\n01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:36.780\nI just want that half an hour of just monkey,\n\n01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.820\nmonkey facts, monkey opinions.\n\n01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:41.500\nI'm dead, I'm dead.\n\n01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.540\nYou wanted to be centered on monkeys.\n\n01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:43.980\nI thought you were more taken, which is,\n\n01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.540\nNo, I just wanted to be a little monkey.\n\n01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.340\nYou don't talk about the creepy economy or anything.\n\n01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:49.540\nYeah, no, it's just about the monkey fact.\n\n01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:53.340\nYou just resigned to this fact about,\n\n01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:54.860\nYeah, they kill kids anyway.\n\n01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:00.020\nBut I feel like the bonobos have it going on\n\n01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:02.460\nbecause they settle all their disputes\n\n01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.660\nthrough fucking and sucking.\n\n01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:04.820\nThey just jerk off all the time.\n\n01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:05.660\nDo they suck too?\n\n01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:06.500\nAre the bonobos the ones with the inflamed?\n\n01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.060\nThey suck and suck and they masturbate\n\n01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:10.940\nand they're bisexual and they're incestuous.\n\n01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:12.380\nI don't know if they're the unadvertiser\n\n01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.420\non your podcast, but why would you name your company\n\n01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:15.260\nbonobos?\n\n01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:17.180\nThat's a big podcast advertiser.\n\n01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:19.540\nAre bonobos the one with the inflamed genitalia?\n\n01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:22.940\nLike they're like their assholes are like pink and rosy.\n\n01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:23.780\nLike it's like a target.\n\n01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:26.340\nWell, they're the ones that are the most like us genetically.\n\n01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.180\nLike they're the closest.\n\n01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.500\nNo, but what are their assholes like?\n\n01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:32.220\nWhy would you name the assseams of clothing companies?\n\n01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.340\nRob wants to know the specifics of their assholes.\n\n01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:37.580\nWhat do their assholes look like?\n\n01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:41.820\nRob equates everybody on asshole how their assholes look.\n\n01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:44.180\nYou guys have seen what they do with frogs, right?\n\n01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.020\nNo.\n\n01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:49.300\nGoogle chimpanzee frog.\n\n01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.140\nThey fuck them.\n\n01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:51.060\nAnd hit enter.\n\n01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:51.900\nThey fuck them.\n\n01:17:51.900 -->

right.\n\n01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:58.740\nI've heard.\n\n01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.180\nThere's 1,000 videos.\n\n01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:00.680\nNo.\n\n01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.460\n1,000 videos.\n\n01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.580\nI don't think I could watch it.\n\n01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:06.580\nBecause any time a frog's ever come near a chimp,\n\n01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:07.900\nthey've gone like this for a second.\n\n01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.980\nAnd then they played with the mouse with their finger.\n\n01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:14.660\nAnd then they just go, I should probably a male chimp.\n\n01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:16.300\nI mean, I don't think.\n\n01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:19.300\nYeah, it's like, they just do it.\n\n01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.780\nAnd then they throw the fucking frog away.\n\n01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.780\nAnd then there's some videos where you watch the frog\n\n01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:24.780\nlike limping away.\n\n01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.780\nOh.\n\n01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:28.460\nIt's a comedy show.\n\n01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.620\nThey fuck the mouse?\n\n01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:36.060\nThey just use it as a flashlight?\n\n01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.060\nYeah.\n\n01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.060\nYeah.\n\n01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.580\nThere are research departments about it.\n\n01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:40.340\nThat's what we're saying.\n\n01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:41.340\nIt's a very specific blog.\n\n01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:42.780\nYou guys can do it tonight.\n\n01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:47.500\nAnd once we get the show running to the peak,\n\n01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:48.740\nthat's my dream for the show is we\n\n01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.420\nneed to come up with a way that we\n\n01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.660\ncan have a live feed so that if they can see what the people\n\n01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:57.780\nat home are seeing, then we can say, Spencer, bring up Google\n\n01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.500\nchimp and frog.\n\n01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.380\nAnd then they can be looking at it.\n\n01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:04.780\nAnd then the people at home can be looking at it.\n\n01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:05.980\nI don't want to watch that.\n\n01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:06.980\nI don't want to watch that.\n\n01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:10.100\nIt's kind of front row.\n\n01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:10.940\nIt's so psyched.\n\n01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.020\nIt's a bad pitch.\n\n01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.020\nIt's a bad pitch.\n\n01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.340\nSpeaking of bad pitches, why don't we\n\n01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:17.460\nstart playing some shadow running?\n\n01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:18.620\nYeah, well, it's DeMorge here.\n\n01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.100\nDeMorge Brown, are you in town?\n\n01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.860\nI didn't see him in the greenery.\n\n01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:22.860\nWe have no DeMorge.\n\n01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:23.780\nWe've got no DeMorge.\n\n01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:25.780\nOh, shit.\n\n01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:27.220\nWe have Rob Schrab is here.\n\n01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:28.220\nOh, Schrab.\n\n01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:29.220\nOh,

the Schrab.\n\n01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:50.060\nI fucked your mom so hard, it was my job.\n\n01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.700\nGot a lazy rap.\n\n01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.860\nAnd the diesel to the Rob,

at the end of your life,\n\n01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:29.580\nlike a battle royale, you had to fight another animal.\n\n01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:30.780\nAnother animal.\n\n01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:31.780\nAnother animal.\n\n01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:37.620\nIf you could look into the netherverse and fight another animal.\n\n01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:39.180\nIf you could fight another animal.\n\n01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.180\nAnother animal.\n\n01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:41.380\nTo the death.\n\n01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:43.780\nWhich animal do you think that you would be equally mashed with?\n\n01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:44.420\nAnd which one?\n\n01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:45.100\nGorilla.\n\n01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:46.220\nYou would fight a gorilla?\n\n01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.100\nFuck yeah.\n\n01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:47.700\nFor real?\n\n01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.580\nNo.\n\n01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:50.580\nOK, how about this.\n\n01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.740\nYou get a weapon.\n\n01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:52.380\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.140\nYou get to fight a.\n\n01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.820\nI'm going to choose a gorilla.\n\n01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:56.980\nYeah, a gorilla is a weapon.\n\n01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:58.940\nYeah, fucker, I'll kill anything.\n\n01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:00.380\nEh, I'll take that, Rhino.\n\n01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.980\nClonies could use the gorilla as a weapon in a bunch of movies.\n\n01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:04.260\nI wasn't listening to the show.\n\n01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.180\nWhat is going on?\n\n01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:06.740\nYou get to fight a gorilla.\n\n01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:10.660\nIs you in a gorilla in a ring, or like in a forest?\n\n01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.460\nWe weren't talking about it.\n\n01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:13.820\nBut you get one weapon.\n\n01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:17.180\nBut it's not a gun, or like an arrow, or a crossbow.\n\n01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.500\nYou get one melee weapon.\n\n01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.500\nLike what do you fight a gorilla with?\n\n01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:22.000\nWhat?\n\n01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:22.500\nA knife?\n\n01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:23.420\nI've hatched it.\n\n01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:23.920\nWhy?\n\n01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.220\nI'm asking you a question, Schrab.\n\n01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.980\nDid he do this to you guys?\n\n01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:28.860\nNo, no.\n\n01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:29.900\nKind of.\n\n01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.340\nWell, I mean, he always asks different things all the time.\n\n01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.940\nWe've just been talking about happy little light subjects\n\n01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:35.420\nout here.\n\n01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:37.420\nAll right.\n\n01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:39.460\nYou versus gorilla, what weapon do you bring in?\n\n01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:40.540\nSchrab versus gorilla.\n\n01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:42.140\nYeah, what weapon do you bring in?\n\n01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:43.300\nIt can't be a gun, or a.\n\n01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.500\nA sharknado.\n\n01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.380\nA sharknado, right?\n\n01:21:46.380 -->

01:21:57.100\nVoodoo doll.\n\n01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:57.660\nVoodoo doll.\n\n01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:58.620\nGorilla voodoo doll.\n\n01:21:58.620 --> 01:21:59.420\nGorilla voodoo doll.\n\n01:21:59.420

01:22:04.460\nThis is empty.\n\n01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:05.340\nI put that there, sorry.\n\n01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:06.340\nOh, OK.\n\n01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:07.300\nIt was in your chair.\n\n01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.380\nCan we get Rob's shop of beer?\n\n01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:09.900\nYeah, let's get Rob's shop of beer.\n\n01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.220\nAll right, well, let's.\n\n01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:12.300\nYou're drinking out of it.\n\n01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:13.580\nDon't go, he can have mine.\n\n01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:13.980\nNo.\n\n01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:14.700\nI got front of Bronco.\n\n01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:15.780\nAll right, well, Schraba's an amazing.\n\n01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.500\nWho brought the front of Bronco, by the way?\n\n01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:18.780\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:19.340\nHello, Sam.\n\n01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:20.020\nThank you so much.\n\n01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:20.700\nHoly

Nightmare on Elm Street,\n\n01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.740\nbecause we lost Wes Craven today, I guess.\n\n01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.300\nWes Craven is dead, yeah.\n\n01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:30.700\nYeah.\n\n01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:32.140\nAnd the funny thing is I ran into Brian Collins.\n\n01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:32.780\nIt's not funny.\n\n01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:34.500\nIt's not funny that he died.\n\n01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:35.140\nIt's kind of funny.\n\n01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:36.980\nI said the funny thing.\n\n01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:40.620\nWhat was there a choice between anything?\n\n01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.580\nLike, was it always?\n\n01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.500\nBetween, like, John Carpenter or Will Craven?\n\n01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:43.980\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.420\nI mean, as far as were you saying, like,\n\n01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.060\nwas it always going to be Nightmare?\n\n01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:48.860\nOr could it have been?\n\n01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:49.900\nOh, thank you so much.\n\n01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:52.180\nCould it have been Scream 2?\n\n01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.100\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.460\nI mean, like, you're going to watch Nightmare on Elm Street\n\n01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:55.940\ntonight.\n\n01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:56.940\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:59.900\nWas that, is there any other choice?\n\n01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:01.220\nDeadly Friend.\n\n01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:01.900\nOh, interesting.\n\n01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:03.780\nDeadly Friend is, like, one of my favorite Wes Craven movies.\n\n01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:04.700\nDeadly Friend's great.\n\n01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:05.740\nShocker?\n\n01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:07.820\nShocker, or Swamp?\n\n01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:11.540\nIt's four in title, two in the pink.\n\n01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:12.740\nNot two.\n\n01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:15.340\nShocker is, what's his face in that?\n\n01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:17.660\nThat's Peter Berg, right?\n\n01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.460\nPeter Berg acts in Shocker.\n\n01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:19.860\nRight.\n\n01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.700\nThat was when he was, like, an 18-year-old actor.\n\n01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:23.660\nThere were two movies that came out when Shocker came out\n\n01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:26.340\nthat were both very similar, and that was very confusing.\n\n01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:28.420\nThere were two horror movies that were both about guys\n\n01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.180\nwho died in electric chairs, I think.\n\n01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:32.740\nWas Shocker the one that goes through the electric outlets?\n\n01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.260\nYeah, I think he becomes electricity,\n\n01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:35.580\nwhich also includes television.\n\n01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:36.260\nBut then there was another.\n\n01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:37.380\nTerrifying.\n\n01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:40.460\nThere was a, yeah, a special effects when horror always\n\n01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:41.620\ngo great together.\n\n01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.580\nSo scary.\n\n01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:45.380\nLawnmower, man, perfect combination of both.\n\n01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:46.980\nHorrifying.\n\n01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:47.740\nWait, what?\n\n01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:49.020\nSo scary.\n\n01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:51.660\nThe one thing that's interesting about Wes Craven,\n\n01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.500\nthough, I feel like, is he really\n\n01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:57.340\nwas able to keep a consistent reinvention of himself.\n\n01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:57.740\nYeah.\n\n01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:01.580\nWhen he did, when he did, uh, the Scream Queen, right?\n\n01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:03.980\nI don't know if it is, Scream Queen?\n\n01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:06.500\nIs that the new show, that Scream Queen show?\n\n01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.060\nAnybody?\n\n01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:07.420\nAnyone?\n\n01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:08.220\nResearchers?\n\n01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:08.860\nIs it?\n\n01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.860\nNo.\n\n01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:13.540\nIt's who?\n\n01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:15.100\nNo, that's Ryan Murphy.\n\n01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.580\nThat's American Horror Story.\n\n01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:20.820\nWe all have a tiny bit of information, all of this.\n\n01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.380\nWe're all just regurgitating.\n\n01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.100\nYeah, we're all just regurgitating.\n\n01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.980\nLike, oh, yeah, yeah, I thought I heard that.\n\n01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:26.700\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:29.300\nBut yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:31.380\nBut definitely a bunch of, a bunch of animals\n\n01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:32.700\nwere killed on Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\n01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:36.740\nI know, I know it, I know it.\n\n01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:39.340\nThe best weapon to, if you wanted to kill Wes Craven\n\n01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.980\nwould be a gorilla.\n\n01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:42.180\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:43.580\nAll right, Dan, he just died today.\n\n01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:44.420\nGood joke.\n\n01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:46.620\nWell, fuck you.\n\n01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.540\nWait, I cued you to do that?\n\n01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:53.700\nSo what do you think?\n\n01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:54.860\nI'm sad he's dead.\n\n01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:56.660\nNo, after the show.\n\n01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:59.340\nThe only reason that game is to guilt you into hanging out\n\n01:24:59.340 --> 01:24:59.840\nwith me.\n\n01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:00.340\nNo, no.\n\n01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:01.020\nYou're going to watch it.\n\n01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:01.980\nWell, all right, I'll hang out.\n\n01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.540\nDo you think it's possible?\n\n01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:04.540\nThis might be a bad pitch.\n\n01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.260\nCan we do it at my place, because my dogs?\n\n01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:08.060\nYes, I would love to do it at your place,\n\n01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:10.020\nbecause I live right in between both of you.\n\n01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:13.340\nDo you guys know there's an audience here?\n\n01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:14.700\nWes Craven died.\n\n01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:18.460\nHe doesn't return my text.\n\n01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:19.380\nHe doesn't.\n\n01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.180\nYou guys could call each other.\n\n01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:22.660\nYou could email each other.\n\n01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:23.820\nHe doesn't pick up.\n\n01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:26.180\nYou don't have to invite all of these people\n\n01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:28.140\nand all of those people.\n\n01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:30.740\nI was writing for the last, like, three weeks I've been trying.\n\n01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:35.740\nYou've been writing since 1993.\n\n01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:36.900\nLet's be serious.\n\n01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.700\nWhen is it going to stop?\n\n01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:41.380\nWhen are you going to have time to hang out with me?\n\n01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:49.660\nI got to go to a marathon of something I did.\n\n01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.300\nSpeaking of lines, it would be great in a trailer\n\n01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:53.180\nfor a concert movie.\n\n01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.860\nThat's part of the reason you guys came here,\n\n01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:57.220\nbecause you're coming out with this concert movie you did.\n\n01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:58.420\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:02.020\nWe did a comedy special in one take on a moving bus.\n\n01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.020\nConcert movies are misnomer, though.\n\n01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.260\nBecause you're not going to go out to theaters and watch them.\n\n01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:08.700\nIt does happen in one night on a glass bus.\n\n01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:12.260\nYeah, we just basically, she and I made the show called\n\n01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:16.540\nCrash Test, where we got this fucking insane glass tube.\n\n01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.140\nAnd we drove around all of Hollywood.\n\n01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:20.100\nMost buses, like, you face the driver.\n\n01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:22.020\nAnd this one, you face the street.\n\n01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:23.660\nAnd it's like stadium seating.\n\n01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:25.820\nAnd the street becomes the stage.\n\n01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.340\nYeah, so we just called all of our comedy friends\n\n01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:29.140\nand said, like, be in.\n\n01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.260\nDidn't call me.\n\n01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.180\nWe did, as a matter of fact.\n\n01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:33.980\nYou gave us permission to get to the community stage.\n\n01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:34.480\nYeah.\n\n01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.140\nOh, that's right.\n\n01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:38.140\nYeah, you were calling Joel McHale through me.\n\n01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:39.620\nThat's what happened.\n\n01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:41.340\nBut so we just drove all around Hollywood\n\n01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.860\nand went to everybody's house.\n\n01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.340\nAnd they just came out in their front yard\n\n01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:45.860\nand did, like, a bit with us.\n\n01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:48.100\nAnd then the bus just keeps going.\n\n01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:48.940\nIt was so fun.\n\n01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:49.540\nIt was so fun.\n\n01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:50.780\nSo we made it into a special.\n\n01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:51.980\nAnd it's on Vimeo.\n\n01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:53.260\nYeah, Vimeo on demand.\n\n01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.140\nWas it called?\n\n01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:54.980\nCrash Test.\n\n01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:55.860\nVimeo.\n\n01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:57.860\nBut it.\n\n01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:59.460\nNo new taxes.\n\n01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:03.740\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.\n\n01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:09.540\nWe have all of our comedy friends, Reno 911, Reno 911\n\n01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:11.420\nreunion, and Earl Swechert, who we've\n\n01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:14.260\nbeen doing comedy with for, God, like the last 10 years,\n\n01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:15.580\nyou know, of the odd future.\n\n01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:16.820\nWe grew up with them.\n\n01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.940\nAnd it's literally like every funny comedy person\n\n01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:21.580\nyou've ever seen, and then Earl Swechert.\n\n01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:23.140\nHe's awesome, but it's just like, what was he?\n\n01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:26.540\nIn your trailer, it does like a Tarantino kind of boom,\n\n01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.220\nboom, boom, of all the last names of, like,\n\n01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.860\nlook at all this fucking A-list people.\n\n01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:31.900\nAnd then one of the, it's all the last names,\n\n01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:36.820\nand sorry, Cordry, Rudd, whatever, that it's like a Swechert.\n\n01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:37.820\nSwechert.\n\n01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:38.980\nThat makes me laugh every time.\n\n01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:41.220\nIt operates on two levels, because it's just\n\n01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:43.220\nthe name of an object.\n\n01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:46.820\nThat's the only level, really, that it operates on.\n\n01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:49.660\nBut you were the only, like, Paramount\n\n01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:52.500\nlet us shoot on their back lot, and basically they're like,\n\n01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:55.060\nyeah, you can shoot anywhere you want on their back lot.\n\n01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:57.260\nEverything will be closed, and we won't turn on any lights\n\n01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:58.180\nfor you.\n\n01:27:58.180 --> 01:27:58.940\nOh.\n\n01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.820\nAnd then Dan was the one who let us at least\n\n01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:04.260\nopen a stage door, so you get to see the set of community\n\n01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:06.980\nand the amazing banner that you had out in front of set.\n\n01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.900\nSounds like a good friend.\n\n01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:08.400\nUh.\n\n01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:08.900\nUh.\n\n01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:09.400\nUh.\n\n01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:09.900\nUh.\n\n01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:10.400\nUh.\n\n01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:10.900\nUh.\n\n01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:13.300\nNo, it's a, the.\n\n01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.220\nI love Schrab's criticisms of you,\n\n01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:16.620\nbecause they're all compliments.\n\n01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:18.900\nLike, you've been writing since 1993.\n\n01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:19.780\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:21.900\nGo to the unerror box, I mean, that.\n\n01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.020\nWhat a put down.\n\n01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:25.020\nRight.\n\n01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:25.520\nSo.\n\n01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:26.020\nUh.\n\n01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:26.520\nUh.\n\n01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:27.020\nUh.\n\n01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:27.700\nIt's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,\n\n01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:28.220\nit's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,\n\n01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:31.280\nit's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's kind of.\n\n01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.060\nRight?\n\n01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:32.380\nYeah.\n\n01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:34.460\nSo you're going to say a funny thing about my set.\n\n01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:37.200\nBesides that, that you can go by the Greendale college.\n\n01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.720\nYou have this banner says nominated for zero Emmy.\n\n01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.280\nUh, hanging up.\n\n01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:45.300\nPut that up for morale, you know, it's, it's one of the funniest\n\n01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:48.060\nthings that just suddenly they're right by inject McBrayer.\n\n01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:49.100\nAnd you know what?\n\n01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:52.260\nThat was the smartest investment show ever made because I got\n\n01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:54.300\nto use that sign for three years in a row.\n\n01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.300\nIt paid for itself.\n\n01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.300\nThat's called amortization.\n\n01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.300\nThat's something Sony never appreciated.\n\n01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:02.300\nI amortized.\n\n01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:05.300\nHey, Dan, do you think that we can all play some Shadowrun together with this group?\n\n01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:07.300\nI think so, yeah.\n\n01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:10.300\nIt's not our finest moment for feminism, but we'll...\n\n01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.300\nYou want me to do sound effects?\n\n01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:14.300\nYeah.\n\n01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.300\nOkay, Rob will do sound effects.\n\n01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:20.300\nNo, you're probably going to need to be a character, because we need everybody that we got up here.\n\n01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:23.300\nSo, no sound effects.\n\n01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:25.300\nRob, follow your heart with sound effects.\n\n01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:27.300\nIf you feel like a sound needs to be affected,\n\n01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.300\nI'll feel the room.\n\n01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.300\nI'll feel the room.\n\n01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:33.300\nWell, if you want to...\n\n01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:35.300\nIt would be a number of mics, because...\n\n01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:37.300\nWhere did we land on you guys getting together after the show?\n\n01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:39.300\nI...\n\n01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:41.300\nIf it's at my place.\n\n01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:43.300\nYes, yes.\n\n01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:45.300\nI met my wife at Schrab's apartment.\n\n01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:47.300\nThat is true.\n\n01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:49.300\nSchrab's apartment was my old apartment.\n\n01:29:49.300 -->
