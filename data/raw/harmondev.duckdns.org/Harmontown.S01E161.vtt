WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
From Hollywood, California, in the secret confines of Meltdown Comics' back room...

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Harmontown is now in session!

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Here we go!

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Let's figure out our game master, Mr. Spencer Crittenden!

00:31.000 --> 00:43.000
And just for good measure, our mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon!

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Spencer, why don't you talk to Jeff for a second?

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Hey Jeff, is that your musical choice? That was really good!

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Damn it! God damn it!

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Stop the show!

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
You dropped the chicken tongues?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
You dropped the chicken tongues?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Spencer, right now, while Dan tries to make himself a drink,

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
right now, what geopolitically is bothering you the most right now?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Geopolitically?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Like, what in the world...

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Oh man.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm going to do a segment called, What in the world is bothering Spencer right now?

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
The violent gang violence in Mexico.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
For real?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah, it's not a joke.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I was thinking about it.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
It would be if you had told us in advance and we could prepare the appropriate theme music.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Violence in Mexico.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Get us up to date with what's going on in Mexico right now.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
I think it's mostly still just the same stuff, you know?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Like, the gangs are just fucking shooting everyone all the time.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
There's just shootouts in the streets.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I mean, it's just violence.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Non-stop.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Drug wars.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
War on drugs.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
War on crime.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
You know, our war on drugs isn't helping.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I'll tell you that right now.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I don't think stopping the war on drugs would solve the problem, though.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I'll be honest.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
I've always said, why not a war on spiders?

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Drugs don't dangle down on string and go into your mouth while you're sleeping.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
They don't lay a million eggs and crawl around with them on their body and then scatter.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
They don't have tiny green reflections in their eyes that you can see if you shine a flashlight.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I've been on Reddit a lot this weekend.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Like, I was supposed to write and I finished the script, but not until I had gone down all these.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
The things that I'll do to keep from writing are like so...

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Like, I would...

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
In my third hour of investigating, going down the rabbit hole of Sandy Hook conspiracy theories,

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
I was like, you'd rather you just...

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
You're surrounded by dead children.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Like, in your mind, rather than working.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
What's the leading conspiracy theory on Sandy Hook?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
These people are...

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
I'm sorry, gang, but you're bad people.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I don't know why I'm apologizing to them, I guess because...

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Here's the thing, some people love their guns so much that...

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
You're like, 20 kids for your gun and they're like, well, that's a lot of kids.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Too bad that hasn't happened.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
And so you're like, no, it just happened and they're like, show me a picture.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Show me a picture of the 20 kids and we're like, that's gross.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
And they're like, no gun. Like, conspiracy.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Wait, they think the conspiracy is that it didn't really happen.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
They think it didn't happen or that it was perpetrated by...

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Because the conspiracy theories have the luxury of going from the end result.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
So anything that would service ultimately, for instance, an anti-gun agenda,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
then you can just write backwards your conspiracy.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
You can rube Goldberg too.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
And you don't even need to do that because you can just go, hey, how come this woman's name is Cheerio,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
but when you look at the Cheerios box, it says no trans fat.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
But then look at what this guy in CNN is saying.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
There's a fine line between conspiracy theory passion and just absolute schizophrenia.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Just noticing connections, connecting dots.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
Do you have a conspiracy that you adhere to? Is there a thing that you think there might be a conspiracy on?

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
Because I haven't researched it, I am quite fond of the idea that...

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Who was the original...

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
The Honeycomb hideout was actually a terrorist cell.

04:53.000 --> 05:00.000
William Randolph-Hurst and the DuPont company, the reason Pot was vilified was because

05:00.000 --> 05:07.000
hemp would have made paper cheaper and didn't need to be chemically treated by DuPont the right way.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
I like the Pot stuff. I believe that stuff.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
The real conspiracy is that you can track all drug legislation in the United States

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
to there was this crazy depressing documentary about it,

05:20.000 --> 05:28.000
that drug policy is linked inexorably throughout our history to racial politics.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
If you have a lot of Chinese labor in your country, opium becomes illegal

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
because there's a culture to this drug that they bring in with them.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
It's something that they're using, that they brought with them.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
You make it illegal so you're effectively making it possible to kick in their doors anytime you want

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
or do anything you want.

05:48.000 --> 05:57.000
That drug policy has always made a handy leash on any group that we've wanted to just have extra power over.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
Spencer, do you have a pet conspiracy theory?

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
No.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Nothing?

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
Maybe. I mean, not that I would imagine is outlandish enough to be entitled that, but yeah, no.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I'm sorry, everybody.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
What do you think that we're getting away with right now?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
What?

06:21.000 --> 06:28.000
I feel like you, Spencer, I can't even see it right now because Dan's standing in the way.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Don't worry, I feel you.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
They put my mic here, man.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
This is where I'm supposed to stand.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
It's for the cameras.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
Spencer, are you saying that you think that everything's fine, that there's no conspiracies in the world

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
that we're not getting away with anything?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Well, I mean, I'm sure there's lots of conspiracies.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I just don't know about them.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
Like, I mean, there's corruption all over Asia, right?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Just in the government?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Like, go on.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
There could be called conspiracies.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I mean, I don't have specifics.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Give me some Asian corruption.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Well, I mean, Chinese officials, they just bribe people and they do housing projects.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I mean, there's just illegal stuff.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Like, you read about it.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Right.

07:05.000 --> 07:16.000
If you like Asian corruption, getting caught in the rain.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
I'm a syllable guy.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I like syllables.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
I like to notice when things will fit like that.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
All right.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
So, okay.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
So, game changer.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I already talked it out in the green room.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Here's a new segment called, I talked it out in the green room.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Hey, talking out in the green room.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
So, it's not going to be as filled with joy.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
And it's going to trickle down to you and you'll be bored.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
The VR technology is here, Jeff.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
It's here.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
It's here.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
It's here.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
It's the valve has won.

07:50.000 --> 07:57.000
They have crossed the finish line in the first leg of the race to have consumer level VR be amazing.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Like, I just finished.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
I came from Justin Roiland's house and he has one of those valve things.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
He's like a developer for it.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
A valve?

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
Valve is a video game company that they've always been on the bleeding edge, Jeff.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
The cutting bleeding edge.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Not the bleeding edge.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
The bleeding edge.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Okay.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
Their edge was razor sharp and caused a lot of bleeding.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
Now, we've gotten to the point because of virtual technology, their edge is now bleeding.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Like, they don't even need to cut things anymore.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Okay.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
That's when you're so far out in front.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
There's nothing to cut.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Well, then make the edge bleed.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Aye, aye, captain.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I trust him with my life.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
That's the ship they're running at valve.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
They've always been there.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
This is not a paid statement.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
It sounds like it.

08:47.000 --> 08:56.000
Well, tough titties for Walter Mitty's.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Now, Dan, explain who Walter Mitty is for these people.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
They know.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
It's Ben Stiller.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Okay.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
They know.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
Can that be the episode title?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
You guys don't know.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
That movie is based on an old viewmaster reel.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
So, I'm just saying, okay, I've tried all the other shit.

09:19.000 --> 09:28.000
And I'm not going to name names because there's going to be a fucking thug-like war between these VR companies and valves going to win.

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
I put on the goddamn helmet and I was fucking in a virtual reality.

09:35.000 --> 09:43.000
I mean, you've all put on the things where you're kind of like, oh, it hurts my brain, but I guess I'm kind of in a Swiss villa.

09:43.000 --> 09:53.000
It's like, and I've tried everything and I walk out just feeling awkward and embarrassed because it's still like the 90s.

09:53.000 --> 10:02.000
And it's like, okay, yeah, I guess what you've accomplished here is you have figured out a way to make a plastic helmet that has the equivalent of an iPhone in front of my face.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
So that when I look through it, I can experience an app that you created.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
It's terrible and you walk out feeling really sad, really sad for all the people that spent billions of dollars.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
There's children starving in probably Asia for sure, right?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
All the officials are taking their foods.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Then you put this shit on.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
It's like putting a sock on your head.

10:24.000 --> 10:34.000
But that's a bad metaphor. It's over, Jeff. It's over. We've crossed the new threshold.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Was there a game that you played?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
There was a lot of things I played. They have these little sample things.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
One of them is you're standing in a kitchen and I'm telling you, you make soup.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
That's not a lie. I'm telling you, that's what you do. You make soup.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
And the whole time you're making soup, you're like, get the fuck out of here because it's like the fridge and the microwave.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
You're like just fucking jam and shit with your hands.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
And there's like a thing that's like, you need to make soup and it's like two carrots.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
You've got to go in and you're like, there's the carrots.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
There's another carrot. You can like fucking open the fridge with your other hand.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
You drop it in the pot. You make soup.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Can you make soup wrong or right?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
There's a way to measure whether you made the soup right or wrong.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
You don't put the right ingredients into the whatever container requires that thing being made.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
But then, yeah, after a while you take the pot and you try throwing it at the robot that's telling you to make soup.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
And it's like, it hits it and you're like, Jesus Christ.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
It's not even a game. There's no score. There's no countdown. There's no pressure.

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
I sit on an iPad and I play games where I'm like, you know, Natalie's diner. You got to make a sandwich.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
And I'm like, you know, Erin's like, it's four in the morning, don't you have a, shut the fuck up.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
Like I've almost earned chopsticks.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
This is like crazy.

11:52.000 --> 11:59.000
Is there a verifiable way that they say, okay, you made the best Reuben of all time or are you fucked it up?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Just guys.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
I don't know.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
No, it's not that.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
It's not far enough along, Jeff.

12:04.000 --> 12:12.000
You're interpreting what I'm saying to you as if the reality of making a sandwich is like there.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
It's not simply sandwich making, but it's not about the quality of the sandwich.

12:16.000 --> 12:23.000
It's about your ability to interact with an actual virtual environment in a way that has only previously been done in movies.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
So walk me through this. So you see like a stack of bread slices of bread?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Soup.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Soup.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
It's fine. You don't just make soup. It's a cold kitchen.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Okay. Let's say you see a carrot. You can walk over and grab a carrot.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
You grab the fucking carrot.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
And do you chop the carrot up?

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Well, you know, I bet you could, but I didn't.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Why didn't you chop the carrot?

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
You see, you feel like you're investigating a soup simulator as if like, you're like, wait, if you can't chop it up.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
The reason I told you-

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
This sounds like a soup simulator. I want to know why.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
But I'm telling you, the thing that's going to blow your mind has nothing to do with how accurately it simulates making soup.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
I'm saying you make soup.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
You dig?

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
Like, it doesn't matter if it's not like, like making soup.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
It's like you make soup.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
But do you-

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
And word-

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
First of all, don't drop an Mbamami while I'm talking about carrots.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
But that's the only word that could possibly express, like, my- to probably punctuate my-

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
Walk me through, like, what is the- how specific do you get? Like, you grab an onion and do you cut the onion?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
You just drop it in a pot.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I'm telling you, it's no more sophisticated on the level of-

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Dropping an onion in a pot is not making soup.

13:38.000 --> 13:46.000
This guy, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, this is the thing. This is the crazy thing about it is, it's not- it's like-

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
But you're a Minecraft guy. Wouldn't you like to be able to chop up and, like, get rewarded for dicing the onion perfectly or not?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
No, man.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
No.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Minecraft is like low-fi and high-function. That's exactly-

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Okay.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
Thank you for proving my point. For wandering into my demons land.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I don't know. I don't play these games.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Anyways, whatever that is.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
What's the controller? Is it your body?

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
Right now, it's still just like, we sticks basically, like, but they have their own.

14:11.000 --> 14:18.000
But they can easily, it's just a matter of expenditure, you know, like, they can easily make, like, you know, easily.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
Like, based on what you're doing, like, it's a really cheap, like, fucking glove that you could, like, grab the carrot!

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
And it's real! It's a real carrot!

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
And I picked up a knife and I went like this.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
You're dropping a carrot. See, that's what I'm talking about.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
And I kept doing it, and I was like, I was scared. I was like, what if blood flies out?

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
That's what I'm talking about. When you hold the knife, what is the knife's function?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Is it an actual- can you chop?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I probably could have chopped carrots, yeah.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Okay. I bet.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
That's possible.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I didn't try. I was in there five minutes, and then they put me somewhere else, and then they put me somewhere else.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Shit is crazy!

14:54.000 --> 15:00.000
But your first instinct was to see whether or not you could slit your own throat with it with a knife.

15:00.000 --> 15:08.000
But, see, that, if you have a real knife and you hold up to your throat, you should just pass out and die, right?

15:08.000 --> 15:17.000
That would be one of the many great applications of virtual reality is loopable suicide.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Yes.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
I mean, believe me, we're coming up on crazy days.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
We're going to go right- talk about whiplash. We're going to go from the days of, and I'm not making fun of anybody for-

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
I'm not one of these guys that's like- I was one of these guys, and now I'm not. I'm old and I'm tired.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
I accept your triggers and your sensitivities and everything. I love you.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
I support you in watching a TV show and being affected by it.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Whoa! The TV show hurt me.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Dear diary.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
I got hurt. Okay, now I'm making fun of you.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
You know what? I hurt myself.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
You said you wouldn't do it.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I'm making a little bit of fun of you.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
But that's because my dad hit me!

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
In front of Cheers!

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
I didn't- I was like, I don't watch Cheers and be like, okay, never mind.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I'm sure your dad hit you too.

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
Were you ever hit in front of iconic TV or was it always down in the basement?

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
There's so many- there was a Napoleon bobblehead going...

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
And that's why I- and I tried. I still got a C-minus in French history. I didn't complain.

16:25.000 --> 16:32.000
So we're gonna- I'm just saying we're gonna do this whip thing because it's like, holy shit.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
Dear Hannibal Season 2. I've always triggered by this thing and blah blah blah.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
And then it's gonna be like, listen man, you can do one of eight things when you put this helmet on.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
There's gonna be lots of ways to just hang out in there and just be like,

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
I'm a big sea otter bouncing an ice cream cone off my belly.

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
But then it's- you know, there's gonna be a lot of just stab stab stab or like, here's a map of my school.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
I don't- I'd like like like, when people are like devou-

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Yeah.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
That's what I'm saying to you.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
You're not reacting to me, we're reacting to the future.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Just to make that clear.

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
And it's gonna get- I'm not sure that's true. It's gonna get crazy, as the kids say.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
They add A's now.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Alright, so I've already talked too much.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
I had the- well I did that and then I had the worst Uber driver ever.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Uber, Uber Corner?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Uber Corner.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
Shit, I can't play on like-

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Okay.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Alright, I can't work like this.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
He's just a bad Uber driver and I can't- I can't, the theme's-

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
What was his name or her name?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I don't know.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Step notes?

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
He wouldn't pick me up, I was standing outside the oyster bar and because I was-

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
I walked from Justin's construction all over Sherman Oaks.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
So I walked to a place where there was no construction to call an Uber.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
I wasn't gonna try to make anybody navigate construction with their Uber.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
That wasn't- that wasn't my goal.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I took the hit.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
I walked to a place.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
I sat down.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
I ordered a drink.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I leave only footprints.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
I don't hang out.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
I don't loiter.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
I don't abuse Uber drivers.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I don't do anything to make anyone's life difficult.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I float on the wind.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm-

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
I'm- I'm Forrest Gump's feather.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
And word.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
Again, the second- the second time that was necessary.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
So I call the guy and then I get- it says, your Uber's here.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
I go out in the sidewalk.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
And by the way, the fact that I had to go out in the sidewalk meant I had to pay $20

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
because I had to- he came so fast that I was like, oh, shit.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Well, I'll just have to leave a 20 and let him keep the change.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
$20 drink.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
So I'm already all revved up.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
I'm out on Moor Park and it's hot and I'm like- and I'm like, well, it says he's here

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
but he's not here.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
I mean, there's like- it's nothing but fucking- because of the construction, like, it's easy.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
God damn it.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
And the guy calls me and he- and it's just like, you just hear music in the background

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
and it's like-

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
I'm not doing any ethnicity of music at all.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
Like, it's just like blanket, just like fucked up, like unmarketable mishmash.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
That could have been a white guy at the end.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
And- and- and-

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
When you left me last night, it was hoppy!

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Okay.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Well, Habibi-

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Well, but when you left me last night-

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
That narrows it down a bit.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
No, but that was coccasite on the front end.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Can't pin me down.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
You left me-

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I don't know what country this guy came from.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
You left me last night because of Habibi.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Well, you left me last night because Habibi!

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
Beautiful red dress, Habibi!

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
I think that guy might be from Cincinnati.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Certainly by way of Syria.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Racist.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
So-

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I- I say Habibi when there's a fish special.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
No, you fucking don't.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
I'm like- I'm like fucking-

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
It's like saying- it's like saying like like like like like like like a Mazel tov.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Okay.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
I say that sometimes.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
I'm- you know, I don't give a fuck.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
I'm a fucking- I'm a white privileged conqueror.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
It assimilate everybody.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
I'm like- I'm like a lehyam, fuck it.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Like- Salu, yeah, fuck you fucking-

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Salum.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Sal- Salum?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
All right.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
No, Salu, like an Italian.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Oh, Salu.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Racist again.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
Can't tell Italians from my clubs.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
All right, so-

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
So you call the guy, it's like-

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
And he keeps going like, I'm- I'm not out- I'm like- I can't- are you at the oyster bar?

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
And I'm going like, yeah, I'm outside the oyster bar.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And he's like, I'm more park!

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
And I'm like, yeah, I'm more park.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
And I'm standing on more park.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
And he's like, but you're not here!

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
And I'm like, you're not here.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
You're not here.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
And he's like, no!

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
You're not here!

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
And the music's like-

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
I was born on the 4th of July!

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Habibi!

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
And I'm like arguing with the guy, and he's like forever.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
And I'm going like, so you're- and I look at the map, and it's like Mission Impossible.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
I'm like, I'm zooming in on your location, sir.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I can see your cartoon car.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Are you situated behind- all the way behind the oyster bar?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
And he's like, I love oyster bar!

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I'm more park!

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Like mad at me.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Like he's like trying to get through to me.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
And I'm like, I'm on more park.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
I'm outside the oyster bar.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
I see your car.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
I think you're in the parking lot behind oyster bar.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
And while that would not normally be an issue, it's basically a block away from me,

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
because you're in the fucking parking lot, and it's like- it's Sherman Oaks.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Like they- I can't just like cut around.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I don't- just trust me.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Go there, take pictures.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
So eventually I'm like, you're in the parking lot.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
And he's like- and then finally he acts exasperated.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
He's like, are you in the parking lot of oyster bar?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
I'm like, no!

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Do I look like a car?

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
And you're not- you're like, why would I go into the parking lot?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I don't have a car!

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Do you think this is how I react to my car being stolen?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I'd be like, oh shit, my car is gone.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
No, I would walk out onto Moorpark, call an Uber,

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
go to walk, and I'd go, and then the guy was like such a sassafras.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Because he was like-

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Now you're racist.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
Because I got in, and so he goes- he goes, he starts driving,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
and he's like, I cannot fucking- the street is just construction.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
And I'm like, mmm, I took- because I know I walked into construction.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Like I didn't say anything though.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.200
Say it again?

22:46.200 --> 22:48.520
I said, why do you walk there to the oyster bar?

22:48.520 --> 22:49.840
Because there's no construction.

22:49.840 --> 22:52.360
I already took that fucking hit.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.880
If I want to hear about fucking construction,

22:53.880 --> 22:57.120
I'll close the fucking Justin's house.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.120
Why are your teeth so gritty?

22:58.120 --> 22:59.200
Because I'm fucking angry.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.240
What are you fucking dumb?

23:02.240 --> 23:03.800
I've never heard that character before,

23:03.800 --> 23:04.720
where you talk with you.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.200
It's fucking anger being restrained,

23:06.200 --> 23:07.960
so I don't say something with my whole mouth.

23:07.960 --> 23:08.880
What do you want to say?

23:08.880 --> 23:10.000
I want to fucking suck on something.

23:10.000 --> 23:10.720
Let it out.

23:10.720 --> 23:11.200
Let it out.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.440
I'll just flip my throat with a virtual knife.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.200
So he pulls one of these.

23:17.200 --> 23:22.160
And by one of these, this is a new one for me.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.480
He's driving it, and he goes, I kept fucking the thing.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.920
And then I'm like, OK, sure.

23:26.920 --> 23:29.320
And I just pulled the Jodie Foster on him.

23:29.320 --> 23:33.880
And by that, I mean, I looked out the window at a world

23:33.880 --> 23:39.520
more important than him, and chose to atone with it

23:39.520 --> 23:41.960
for all the pain I've been through,

23:41.960 --> 23:44.400
rather than I'm not going to stoop there.

23:44.400 --> 23:49.400
And so find the camera, and turn the light on,

23:49.400 --> 23:51.520
and give me your Jodie Foster's, that camera

23:51.520 --> 23:52.520
with the red light there.

23:52.520 --> 23:57.640
OK, here's the Jodie Foster if you're outside my car window.

23:57.640 --> 23:58.120
OK.

24:01.120 --> 24:01.880
Now, let me do it again.

24:01.880 --> 24:02.640
Let me do it again.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.280
That looked like somebody set off a cherry bomb

24:04.280 --> 24:05.880
outside the car.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.440
All right, let me do it again.

24:08.440 --> 24:11.440
OK.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.800
All right, can we move on?

24:12.800 --> 24:13.920
We got it, we got it.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.600
So the Jodie Foster's wrapped.

24:17.600 --> 24:22.520
So he goes, I pick you up there before, no.

24:22.520 --> 24:26.040
And I said, no, not the oyster bar, no.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.560
Or he said, I drive you before, yes.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.240
That's what he said.

24:29.240 --> 24:33.080
And I said, maybe, I'm like, you're bald.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.360
Like, I don't know, I don't know what to go by.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.960
And he's like, and many times from there.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.080
And I'm like, no, not the oyster bar, no.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.960
And he's like, yeah, yeah.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.840
He was like, like, oh, I was like, oh, really?

24:46.840 --> 24:48.400
You picked me up at the oyster bar a lot?

24:48.400 --> 24:50.480
He's like, yeah, yeah.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.280
What?

24:51.280 --> 24:55.120
How does he think he's going to get through this debate?

24:55.120 --> 24:58.320
Like, oh, I'm like, I said, oh, really?

24:58.320 --> 25:00.360
So am I a doctor?

25:00.360 --> 25:01.080
He's like, what?

25:01.080 --> 25:03.280
I'm like, where do I work?

25:03.280 --> 25:06.840
Tell me some more shit about myself.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.040
But I didn't say it like that.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.960
I was like, tell me some more shit about myself.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.040
And he did the scariest thing on the road.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.560
He's like, I'm sorry, buddy.

25:14.560 --> 25:15.400
I'm sorry.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.600
And I felt like, oh my god, the Eastern European guys

25:18.600 --> 25:21.600
in the wire, he's going to kill me.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.000
I'm scared of Eastern Europeans.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.240
Racist, fine.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.800
But fine.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.720
I would rather be killed by any other ethnically

25:29.720 --> 25:33.400
identifiable group in the world before an Eastern European.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.680
Why?

25:34.680 --> 25:35.280
The wire.

25:35.280 --> 25:43.520
Which? From my extensive experience as a born identity.

25:43.520 --> 25:48.080
What kind of person would you pick the first person

25:48.080 --> 25:48.480
to kill you?

25:48.480 --> 25:49.080
Who would it be?

25:49.080 --> 25:50.920
I feel like, honestly, I'm going to go

25:50.920 --> 25:53.200
with good old fashioned black guy.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.640
Good old fashioned black guy?

25:54.640 --> 25:56.960
Yeah, because I feel like they're not just describing.

25:56.960 --> 25:57.840
Like, what's he wearing?

25:57.840 --> 25:58.680
What's he look like?

25:58.680 --> 26:00.840
No, this is not fair what you're doing to me.

26:00.840 --> 26:01.920
I'm saying.

26:01.920 --> 26:05.720
You said that you would think.

26:05.720 --> 26:10.240
I'm saying, first, I'm running through my simulators

26:10.240 --> 26:16.240
of if you're getting killed by an ethnic person and why are you?

26:16.240 --> 26:18.560
What is that death consisting of?

26:18.560 --> 26:21.640
I'm going to go with the black guy over there.

26:21.640 --> 26:25.040
The Eastern European is like, I don't want to.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.800
I feel like I would be in a warehouse.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.120
And according to everything I've seen,

26:29.120 --> 26:35.160
the first you wake up and they're like, hello, hello, big boy.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.160
And I'm like, what the fuck?

26:36.160 --> 26:38.080
What the fuck is going on?

26:38.080 --> 26:40.720
And they're like, you take my fucking money.

26:40.720 --> 26:43.080
And you're like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.840
And then there's like a crocodile in there pouring concrete.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.800
Like, wait, wait.

26:48.800 --> 26:52.080
Like, what do black people do when they kill you?

26:52.080 --> 26:55.120
Hold on, tell me about the crocodile and the concrete.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.160
I don't fucking know.

26:56.160 --> 26:57.120
You just scream.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.520
And then like, they find your body and David Cruz is like,

26:59.520 --> 27:02.760
looks like crocodiles eat.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.520
Two.

27:05.520 --> 27:11.200
OK, so that you don't want to die by Eastern European guy.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.560
But you want to die by black guy.

27:12.560 --> 27:14.240
Because how do you think that's going to go?

27:14.240 --> 27:17.960
What's the best way that you get killed by a black guy?

27:17.960 --> 27:20.800
You're trying to make me sound racist.

27:20.800 --> 27:21.560
So I'm going to.

27:21.560 --> 27:22.280
No, I'm not.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.000
I'm trying to escape that nuisance.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.640
I'm not saying that.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.240
You get to pick.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.240
We're talking about pop cultural deaths.

27:28.240 --> 27:31.360
How do white men die in movies?

27:31.360 --> 27:34.600
And then so I will take one of the and the answer is if killed.

27:34.600 --> 27:38.600
There's probably a chart like if killed by black man in movies,

27:38.600 --> 27:39.640
white man dies.

27:39.640 --> 27:40.240
How?

27:40.240 --> 27:41.640
It's not by machete.

27:41.640 --> 27:44.160
It's not by like, like, like he's like, you know, Redwood

27:44.160 --> 27:46.560
Forest and he hears his wife's voice, even though she's

27:46.560 --> 27:49.560
been dead for 10 years, and then he has to like see Satan

27:49.560 --> 27:52.040
and his fucking pores explode with heroin.

27:52.040 --> 27:57.520
Like if it's statistically on a on a bar graph of one race

27:57.520 --> 28:01.520
killing another in movies, if a white guy dies by a black guy,

28:01.520 --> 28:03.800
it's like a stray bullet.

28:03.800 --> 28:04.680
A stray bullet.

28:04.680 --> 28:07.520
Yeah, or so or it's like or it's like Patrick Swayze or

28:07.520 --> 28:09.800
something that's like, I love my wife so much.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.040
Hey, man, give me your money.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.520
Hey, let's be reasonable.

28:12.520 --> 28:15.440
Oh, oh, I love my wife.

28:15.440 --> 28:16.680
OK, so it's easy.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.480
It's easy.

28:17.480 --> 28:18.440
It's soft and easy.

28:18.440 --> 28:21.680
It's like it's like Shakespearean.

28:21.680 --> 28:23.640
I just want my pen lights up.

28:23.640 --> 28:29.800
OK, so Dan, you get to write your own death, like play along

28:29.800 --> 28:30.680
with me here.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.240
It's a death by another person.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.160
It could be a man.

28:33.160 --> 28:34.240
It could be a woman.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.120
It's one person.

28:35.120 --> 28:35.960
What race?

28:35.960 --> 28:36.760
You get to pick.

28:36.760 --> 28:37.560
I get to pick the race?

28:37.560 --> 28:38.000
Yes.

28:38.000 --> 28:38.760
Black guy.

28:38.760 --> 28:39.720
OK.

28:39.720 --> 28:40.880
But he did the second.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.640
But how do you want that death to happen?

28:43.640 --> 28:45.560
You get to pick.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.440
You die because somebody else kills you.

28:48.440 --> 28:49.360
It could be a man or woman.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.120
You've already picked black man.

28:51.120 --> 28:51.720
Right?

28:51.720 --> 28:52.280
Right, sure.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.680
Well, I'll pick black woman.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.440
OK, well, I like that.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.320
That's good.

28:57.320 --> 28:58.080
I deserve that.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.760
You can pick any of them.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.600
I deserve that more.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.400
I like black women.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.640
How would you like to die?

29:04.640 --> 29:09.640
You get to pick the race, the gender, the whole thing.

29:09.640 --> 29:13.480
OK, well, then I guess I'm at the bank and I'm like,

29:13.480 --> 29:16.160
here's my golf fund.

29:16.160 --> 29:19.640
And then she comes in and she's got a big afro

29:19.640 --> 29:21.440
and she's got an olive jacket.

29:21.440 --> 29:27.080
And she's hot and she's like, free, suckers,

29:27.080 --> 29:31.560
this is a hold up for the 1970s.

29:31.560 --> 29:35.160
And I'm like, easy, easy.

29:35.160 --> 29:38.120
And then she's like, but then I can

29:38.120 --> 29:40.800
see there's humanity in her eyes.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.840
Because she gets fucked over.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.320
Because she's just like, this ain't your money.

29:46.320 --> 29:48.760
She pulls a totally smooth robbery.

29:48.760 --> 29:49.840
She's got it down to a science.

29:49.840 --> 29:52.360
She's like, all y'all's money is.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.360
No, that sounds terrible.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.600
I didn't mean to do bad grammar.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.800
All y'all's money is insured.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.960
It was the plural on the y'all's that sounded terrible.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.880
All y'all's money is insured.

30:03.880 --> 30:04.800
This ain't your money.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.160
It's the government's money.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.080
They fucked you over.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.320
Now I'm fucking them over.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.040
So keep your goddamn head down.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.200
You won't get a blown off.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.800
And I'm like, she sounds like she knows what she's doing.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.120
And then she's filling her bag.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.880
And then somebody just pulls some crazy shit on her.

30:17.880 --> 30:20.160
Like the bad honky.

30:20.160 --> 30:24.160
Like he hits the alarm, and he shouldn't hit the alarm.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.400
Who do you cast as a bad honky in this?

30:26.400 --> 30:27.560
It's Dabney Coleman.

30:27.560 --> 30:31.440
And then it's like, and he did it, and he did it.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.240
And she's like, why did you do that?

30:33.240 --> 30:34.360
Why did you do that?

30:34.360 --> 30:37.000
And I don't know what happens at that point.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.480
She gets shot.

30:38.480 --> 30:41.960
Like Dabney Coleman's got a little fucking asshole gun.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.440
And then she gets shot.

30:43.440 --> 30:44.760
But then something happens, and I

30:44.760 --> 30:46.840
don't have time to write the whole thing, but basically

30:46.840 --> 30:50.600
it ends up with me and her in the bank vault.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.740
Because I somehow, it was kind of like a dog day afternoon

30:53.740 --> 30:55.400
meets Cadillac Man.

30:55.400 --> 31:00.160
Like what do you call it?

31:00.160 --> 31:01.880
Stockholm syndrome kind of thing.

31:01.880 --> 31:06.200
But it's like she and I, we end up,

31:06.200 --> 31:08.640
we solve everything in those dark days

31:08.640 --> 31:10.720
before we die together.

31:10.720 --> 31:11.760
Because she has to kill me.

31:11.760 --> 31:12.640
How do you die, though?

31:12.640 --> 31:15.200
Well, she has to, I mean, I'm picking this

31:15.200 --> 31:17.240
because I died by a black woman.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.440
So she has to kill me, right?

31:18.440 --> 31:20.120
But under what circumstances?

31:20.120 --> 31:21.440
Third act, how do you?

31:21.440 --> 31:23.760
I guess right at the end, I reveal myself to be like,

31:23.760 --> 31:27.640
I'm like, I'm sorry, you can't trust me either.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.600
And then she shoots me?

31:29.600 --> 31:30.960
Yeah, it feels bad.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.680
I don't want to be selfish, but I'd rather

31:33.680 --> 31:37.560
she has to kill me because I like, oh, oh, oh, I know why.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.960
Because I helped her.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.800
I aided and abetted her.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.960
And I'm like, there's nothing in my insurance policy

31:44.960 --> 31:47.880
about treason.

31:47.880 --> 31:48.640
Do it.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.960
Do it for my wife and kids.

31:49.960 --> 31:53.880
And she's like, I can't do it, Mr. Harmon.

31:53.880 --> 31:56.640
And I'm like, don't you ever fucking call me Mr. Anything.

31:56.640 --> 32:00.400
You fucking awesome black woman.

32:00.400 --> 32:04.040
And she's like, you fucking unexpectedly wonderful white

32:04.040 --> 32:05.760
man.

32:05.760 --> 32:08.120
And I'm like, just fucking shoot me.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.280
And it goes black.

32:09.280 --> 32:15.240
And then it's just like fucking Aaron Sorkin.

32:15.240 --> 32:22.800
So that's a good death.

32:22.800 --> 32:26.000
I don't want that to be misperceived

32:26.000 --> 32:29.600
as an invitation of any kind to black women across America.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.400
It's too late now.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.680
It's already out there.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.080
Spencer, how would you die if you could pick a way

32:34.080 --> 32:35.560
to be murdered by another human being?

32:35.560 --> 32:35.840
How would it go down?

32:35.840 --> 32:37.040
You have to pick race and gender.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.000
That's what I'm interested in.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.120
Oh, who is your murderer?

32:40.120 --> 32:41.800
Or it could be an animal.

32:41.800 --> 32:42.440
It could be a woman.

32:42.440 --> 32:42.960
It could be a man.

32:42.960 --> 32:43.600
It could be anything.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.000
I'm going to keep it Asian.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.040
I'm going to go with sumo wrestler would be awesome.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.440
Whoa.

32:50.440 --> 32:53.520
But he just ripped my head off my body.

32:53.520 --> 32:57.600
But walk us through how that goes down.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.080
Why?

32:58.080 --> 32:58.600
All right.

32:58.600 --> 33:06.840
So I'm at the supermarket looking at frozen vegetables.

33:06.840 --> 33:10.160
And I bump my cart into someone's cart.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.040
And I go, oh, shit.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.320
Sumo wrestler.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.000
And he's not having it.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.320
And I'm like, I'm sorry, man.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.560
I'm just trying to get some peas.

33:19.560 --> 33:21.600
And he's like, I'm trying to get something.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.880
And I ask, what?

33:22.880 --> 33:24.680
And he says, your head.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.240
And then he just rips off my head.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.760
All right.

33:30.760 --> 33:39.320
Well, our next guests are no strangers to racism.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.280
These are actually really old friends of ours.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.080
I bet a lot of people would be surprised how long we've

33:43.080 --> 33:43.760
known these guys.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.360
We don't hang out every day.

33:45.360 --> 33:49.160
But our connection goes way back to pre-Youtube days

33:49.160 --> 33:50.320
and channel 101.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.280
I hope they don't want to know.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.120
They're not trying to keep their age secret, right?

33:56.120 --> 33:58.280
Because unless they were 11 back then.

33:58.280 --> 34:01.120
Oh, boy, are we old.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.440
But they were part of this amazing troop

34:03.440 --> 34:05.560
that was doing early, like channel 101 New York stuff.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.160
The human giant.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.200
The other guy was a Z-Ease.

34:08.200 --> 34:09.080
And he went, you know.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.160
I mean, one thing I want to talk to these guys about

34:11.160 --> 34:14.560
is that they've never, I don't know, that's like that troop.

34:14.560 --> 34:18.200
Like, it never goes like, OK, we're Simon and Garfunkel.

34:18.200 --> 34:19.320
We're going this way or that way.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.720
Or we're breaking up or we're reuniting, as far as I know.

34:21.720 --> 34:25.320
They've kind of all individually done amazing stuff.

34:25.320 --> 34:28.560
We've got two of them here tonight promoting a,

34:28.560 --> 34:30.960
that makes it seem crass that they're here promoting something.

34:30.960 --> 34:32.320
They're just here.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.160
If they promote something, it's on accident.

34:35.160 --> 34:38.680
But they just finished working on something, a concert movie

34:38.680 --> 34:39.840
that we'll talk about, too.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.280
So let's welcome some old friends of mine

34:42.280 --> 34:44.400
and some new friends of yours, Misty.

34:48.160 --> 34:48.880
That was good.

34:48.880 --> 34:49.560
That was really good.

34:49.560 --> 34:53.040
I've been looking for a standard intro like Duncan Trussell

34:53.040 --> 34:53.520
has.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.040
You choked over in the back, but that was actually

34:55.040 --> 34:55.760
really good.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.400
No, no, that's why I laughed because it was so good.

34:58.400 --> 35:02.120
I was like, oh, wow, that's nice.

35:02.120 --> 35:05.560
Say it again, but say it was, like, throw it away.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.840
Do it like that means nothing to you.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.400
So please give an H-town welcome for some old friends of mine

35:11.400 --> 35:14.440
and new friends of yours, Mr. Paul Scheer and Rob Hubel.

35:14.440 --> 35:32.600
Hi.

35:32.600 --> 35:35.040
I'm watching the live stream backstage

35:35.040 --> 35:36.560
and just thinking it would be great

35:36.560 --> 35:39.680
if there was a thermometer reading on the live stream

35:39.680 --> 35:43.720
just to see how the temperature is treating everybody here.

35:43.720 --> 35:44.600
Well, you don't need one.

35:44.600 --> 35:50.360
You have the equivalent of a mercury bird.

35:50.360 --> 35:52.640
Because I was just thinking, I'm pouring sweat.

35:52.640 --> 35:55.240
Oh, I did a show here earlier today.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.200
I poured sweat.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.520
I stopped, and now I've come back to pour sweat again.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.080
This is it.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.320
This is my workout for the week.

36:00.320 --> 36:00.920
Thank you.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.640
I don't sweat at all.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.600
I'm tired of having to explain to these guys.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.800
It's six degrees colder out there.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.920
I'm not just a pollution.

36:09.920 --> 36:13.440
You're the reverse letterman.

36:13.440 --> 36:16.120
Letterman keeps the studio cool, like 60 degrees.

36:16.120 --> 36:19.960
You jack it up to 107 degrees.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.440
All right, so let's dig in.

36:25.880 --> 36:26.360
What?

36:26.360 --> 36:27.360
Wait.

36:27.360 --> 36:30.800
Rob, you have to pick a way you're going to die.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.440
But Paul has to be the one that kills you.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.520
You get to pick the circumstances and the way

36:35.520 --> 36:36.560
that he dispatches you.

36:36.560 --> 36:40.360
How do you let Paul Scheer murder you?

36:40.360 --> 36:43.800
First of all, great question.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.320
I've given this a lot of thought, actually.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.560
Is it something, do I have to be aware of it before it

36:48.560 --> 36:50.640
happens, or can it be sort of like a sneak attack?

36:50.640 --> 36:51.240
You get to pick.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.840
Also, it could be when you're 90 years old.

36:52.840 --> 36:53.640
It could be tomorrow.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.520
It could be when you're five years old.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.120
It could be anything you want.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.160
You have to die.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.320
When he was five years old.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.000
So he can go back in time and kill himself.

37:03.000 --> 37:03.600
Wow.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.080
He gets to pick how he dies, but it

37:05.080 --> 37:07.360
has to be at Paul Scheer's hand.

37:07.360 --> 37:08.480
How do you like to go out?

37:08.480 --> 37:10.880
Go my time traveling back, like a terminator?

37:10.880 --> 37:12.240
It's up to Rob.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.640
All right, it's up to Rob.

37:13.640 --> 37:16.480
If he does time travel back, is he totally nude?

37:16.480 --> 37:19.400
Like a...

37:19.400 --> 37:20.920
See, this is why I ask.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.280
Because I feel like that's where you want us to go.

37:23.280 --> 37:23.800
Right.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.680
So you get to pick.

37:25.680 --> 37:27.880
Not only do you get to pick how Paul kills you.

37:27.880 --> 37:30.040
You get to pick what he's wearing or what he's not wearing.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.000
It sounds like he has to be nude and five years old.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.920
Well, I mean, yeah.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.920
I would love a five-year-old terminator.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.800
That would be the best version of the new terminator.

37:38.800 --> 37:42.040
Just like a really bad ass kid.

37:42.040 --> 37:42.640
All right, I think I got it.

37:42.640 --> 37:43.800
A little criminal child.

37:43.800 --> 37:44.440
I think I got it.

37:44.440 --> 37:45.080
Rob, you got it?

37:45.080 --> 37:48.520
Yeah, I think it was my birthday when I was seven years old.

37:48.520 --> 37:52.400
My parents had this really sort of homegrown birthday party

37:52.400 --> 37:54.960
for me where they had like my little friends come over.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.920
And I don't know why they did this, but they made a ton,

37:57.920 --> 38:00.400
a shit ton of like mashed potatoes.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.880
And we were all like in our swimsuit.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.280
This sounds very erotic.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.400
We were all like in our swimsuit.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.200
A birthday party with tons of mashed potatoes?

38:09.200 --> 38:09.960
Oh, wait, explain.

38:09.960 --> 38:14.240
I'm fucking hard as a fucking diamond right now.

38:14.240 --> 38:17.240
So we were all in our little swimsuits.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.200
And everyone had a spoon.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.600
And it was just like a food fight.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.120
It was just like someone yelled, like, go.

38:22.120 --> 38:25.640
And we all just fucking threw a shitload of food at each other.

38:25.640 --> 38:29.480
And it was just like the simplest, dumbest, happiest

38:29.480 --> 38:30.160
I've ever been.

38:30.160 --> 38:35.200
So I think that if Paul Shear showed up at that moment,

38:35.200 --> 38:36.000
naked.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
As a five-year-old?

38:38.000 --> 38:39.160
No, as an adult, I think.

38:39.160 --> 38:40.440
All right.

38:40.440 --> 38:41.040
Yeah.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.680
Like current Paul, right?

38:42.680 --> 38:45.600
Yeah, current Paul, full throttle.

38:45.600 --> 38:46.960
Like super hard.

38:46.960 --> 38:52.000
Well, and I mean, yeah, as long as no metal was exposed,

38:52.000 --> 38:53.160
I could probably time travel.

38:53.160 --> 38:56.840
But now as an adult, I do have a metal rod in my penis

38:56.840 --> 38:58.040
to keep it hard all the time.

38:58.040 --> 39:01.760
So a metal would prevent you from time traveling?

39:01.760 --> 39:02.720
It isn't exposed.

39:02.720 --> 39:04.400
It's not like at the fucking airport.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.560
That's always been a weird thing about Terminator.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.280
It was good enough for the first Terminator movie.

39:09.280 --> 39:09.920
It was kind of cool.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.120
It was like, well, why would he look like Arnold Schwarzenegger?

39:12.120 --> 39:15.240
And the reason is because living mechanical things, she.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.280
The living tissue, yeah, covered it up.

39:16.280 --> 39:20.320
But then after you were 11, you were like, well, but come on.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.120
Yeah, he's still a giant robot underneath there.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.120
Like why would that matter?

39:24.120 --> 39:25.280
Why don't you just like, yeah.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.680
Well, in this last movie, his hand is ripped off.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.600
He's like, oh, yeah, I can't time travel because now you

39:29.600 --> 39:32.320
can see it.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.040
I believe you.

39:33.040 --> 39:33.540
Really?

39:33.540 --> 39:34.040
Yeah.

39:34.040 --> 39:34.680
Are you fucking kidding me?

39:34.680 --> 39:36.360
That's the whole conceit is that he's

39:36.360 --> 39:37.920
got to wait around for 30 years.

39:37.920 --> 39:42.600
That's how the Terminator gets older is he's like, I'll wait here.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.720
And then how did this get off of little kids in bathing suits

39:45.720 --> 39:46.720
with mashed potatoes?

39:46.720 --> 39:47.720
How did we get off of that?

39:47.720 --> 39:50.440
Can we fucking stick to one side?

39:50.440 --> 39:50.940
Sorry.

39:50.940 --> 39:51.880
Yeah, sorry.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.000
We said no tangents.

39:53.000 --> 39:53.720
We said no tangents.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.800
OK, no tangents for the whole show or just this question?

39:56.800 --> 40:00.800
That's the rule of Harmontown is no tangents.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.920
Mashed potato birthday party.

40:02.920 --> 40:05.680
I'm there as a naked adult rock hard.

40:05.680 --> 40:10.680
But what I would like to not see it coming,

40:10.680 --> 40:13.880
I would like for you to just sort of materialize behind me

40:13.880 --> 40:17.560
with a fucking huge hatchet.

40:17.560 --> 40:22.200
And just fucking slice me down the brain.

40:22.200 --> 40:26.000
My parents and everyone's like, what the fuck?

40:26.000 --> 40:29.840
But it would be a service to me because my life wasn't

40:29.840 --> 40:32.800
going to get any better than that, you know?

40:32.800 --> 40:33.680
Not at all.

40:33.680 --> 40:34.880
So thank you.

40:34.880 --> 40:39.160
Do you guys think they're, I was going to say they say.

40:39.160 --> 40:39.680
Well done.

40:39.680 --> 40:42.240
I don't know who they are, but I heard somewhere,

40:42.240 --> 40:44.840
and it was probably an eighth grade history teacher,

40:44.840 --> 40:48.120
that the guillotine is like the most humane execution

40:48.120 --> 40:49.080
we've come up with so far.

40:49.080 --> 40:49.960
That's what they say, right?

40:49.960 --> 40:54.880
Because the speed that it goes down, all you feel is a,

40:54.880 --> 40:55.960
who knows this?

40:55.960 --> 40:56.520
Who studies this?

40:56.520 --> 40:57.480
But by the way, it seems.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.400
You feel a coldness on the back of your neck

40:59.400 --> 41:00.040
and then it's done.

41:00.040 --> 41:03.760
I feel like that, if we ever did that, though, now,

41:03.760 --> 41:05.560
it would be viewed as the most inhumane.

41:05.560 --> 41:07.080
Oh yeah, well, it looks terrible.

41:07.080 --> 41:07.960
Well, they also say.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.960
The thing we do to them, lethal injection, is like,

41:09.960 --> 41:10.880
you know, worse.

41:10.880 --> 41:11.600
It's terrible.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.000
They're experiencing a terrible thing.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.360
That drowning is like pretty fucking cool.

41:16.360 --> 41:16.860
Really?

41:16.860 --> 41:17.360
Yeah.

41:17.360 --> 41:18.240
Are you serious?

41:18.240 --> 41:19.240
I thought I got it right.

41:19.240 --> 41:20.240
No fucking way, man.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.240
I thought it's just like.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.760
I'd rather burn to death.

41:22.760 --> 41:23.880
Oh, water.

41:23.880 --> 41:26.920
You know, it's just like, well, but what about the,

41:26.920 --> 41:28.000
what about the writhing?

41:28.000 --> 41:30.880
I'm like, oh, God, oh, that part of me.

41:30.880 --> 41:34.000
For me, if I had to pick firing squad all the way, firing squad.

41:34.000 --> 41:34.920
I want drums.

41:34.920 --> 41:35.560
I want dudes.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.880
Like, I want guys in keppies.

41:36.880 --> 41:37.760
That's fucking insane.

41:37.760 --> 41:38.440
And I think you're lying.

41:38.440 --> 41:40.400
I want Claude Reigns to be out there in front.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.960
They go, do you have any less words?

41:41.960 --> 41:44.200
And I go, up your butt with a coconut.

41:44.200 --> 41:47.760
And then they put the blindfold on me and they would shoot me.

41:47.760 --> 41:50.080
And then have bolts of lead fly through the air

41:50.080 --> 41:53.360
at the speed of sound to go into random parts of your body.

41:53.360 --> 41:56.360
If you've ever seen firing squad footage of people dying,

41:56.360 --> 41:58.800
they go, boom, and the person's head goes,

41:58.800 --> 42:00.960
and that's it, they're fucking, they're clearly dead,

42:00.960 --> 42:02.160
right off the bat.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.600
Isn't the whole thing of the firing squad

42:03.600 --> 42:05.600
that only one person has a bullet,

42:05.600 --> 42:07.000
but they're all aiming at your head?

42:07.000 --> 42:08.480
No, no, no, no, it's the other way around.

42:08.480 --> 42:12.160
There's a blank that everyone gets to assume is there.

42:12.160 --> 42:15.240
You might have the blank, you might not have been the one.

42:15.240 --> 42:15.800
Got it.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.320
I like your way better though.

42:17.320 --> 42:21.600
It's just like, one guy just sucks.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.360
You shot him in the shoulder, you asshole.

42:24.360 --> 42:27.560
You always get to go home at night from your work a day

42:27.560 --> 42:29.680
job on the firing squad.

42:29.680 --> 42:31.120
How was work today, honey?

42:31.120 --> 42:32.360
I had the blank again.

42:32.360 --> 42:33.280
I had the blank in there.

42:33.280 --> 42:36.280
Oh, sweetie, that's great because you know how much

42:36.280 --> 42:39.160
my parents disapprove of your job.

42:39.160 --> 42:42.560
Yeah, tell them three weeks and running.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.240
I guess I'm just born for this job.

42:45.240 --> 42:48.720
Please stop telling your parents what I do for a living.

42:48.720 --> 42:51.400
Each firing squad guy has on the door of his locker.

42:51.400 --> 42:55.280
They all have the blank days since the last fatality.

42:55.280 --> 42:59.000
A sign and all of them say $500,000

42:59.000 --> 43:00.840
because they all keep insisting they have them.

43:00.840 --> 43:01.840
They're all super lucky.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.240
Each one of them is telling you, yeah,

43:03.240 --> 43:04.240
I just always get the blank.

43:04.240 --> 43:04.840
I don't know.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.200
Sure you did, Tony.

43:06.200 --> 43:07.120
Sure you did.

43:07.120 --> 43:10.880
And then Kevin walks away and is like, it was me.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.360
They all go to P.F. Chang's afterward and they just like,

43:13.360 --> 43:15.880
they joke about, you guys killed so many people.

43:15.880 --> 43:18.720
No, you did.

43:18.720 --> 43:19.960
I never have.

43:19.960 --> 43:23.200
Me neither, ha-ha, more than one tons.

43:23.200 --> 43:26.040
The Bullet Fairy visits one of them in the middle of the night.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.480
It's like a Christmas carol, but for executioner.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.200
And like, you did kill all these people.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.200
Let's look at their lives.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.600
And then you, you know, then you kill yourself at the end.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.080
It's a really dark Christmas carol.

43:35.080 --> 43:36.680
But then you get the blank.

43:36.680 --> 43:38.240
Yeah, then you get the blank.

43:38.240 --> 43:42.400
And then you live the best life ever.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.520
I still think a great way to die would

43:44.520 --> 43:47.920
Kraken would be death by Kraken.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.600
Death by Kraken.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.720
I was going to say a base jumping accident.

43:51.720 --> 43:53.800
Like, have you seen any of those documentaries where,

43:53.800 --> 43:56.160
you know, they're in like those squirrel suits.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.560
Just going like 600 miles an hour.

43:58.560 --> 44:01.480
Not actual squirrel suits, but like, you mean like the flanks.

44:01.480 --> 44:02.480
Yeah, those wing suits.

44:02.480 --> 44:04.600
They're not dressed like squirrels.

44:04.600 --> 44:07.760
Well, they look sort of like squirrels.

44:07.760 --> 44:09.200
But no, specifically, yeah.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.360
They do look like squirrels.

44:10.360 --> 44:11.640
Like, yeah.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.560
And they go like real close to like the mountain.

44:13.560 --> 44:14.280
To the terrain.

44:14.280 --> 44:16.840
Yeah, and every now and then there's just like a guy that just,

44:16.840 --> 44:19.200
it's just like fucking pink mist.

44:19.200 --> 44:24.520
It's just like, it's just like just pink mist.

44:24.520 --> 44:26.520
That's just like terrible.

44:26.520 --> 44:27.640
There's so fast.

44:27.640 --> 44:28.440
There's our band name.

44:28.440 --> 44:29.840
That's so disturbing.

44:29.840 --> 44:30.640
Pink mist.

44:30.640 --> 44:31.680
It's just so fast.

44:31.680 --> 44:34.720
I think that's the title of the episode.

44:34.720 --> 44:37.720
Refreshing Pink Mist.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.560
The effervescence.

44:39.560 --> 44:41.520
The good people of the Coca-Cola Corporation

44:41.520 --> 44:45.480
have captured the flavor and impulsiveness

44:45.480 --> 44:48.320
of an extreme sportsman.

44:48.320 --> 44:49.560
Aerosol misting.

44:49.560 --> 44:51.280
It will shoot your head right off.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.200
All right, now, Paul, you said Kraken,

44:53.200 --> 44:56.080
if you could either die or kill somebody,

44:56.080 --> 44:59.560
but the magic was involved, you could be the murderer.

44:59.560 --> 45:01.400
OK, how about this?

45:01.400 --> 45:04.000
You get to kill Dan Harmon because you have to.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.960
Because maybe he's going to do some terrible thing.

45:05.960 --> 45:06.920
He's Hitler.

45:06.920 --> 45:07.760
The new Hitler.

45:07.760 --> 45:10.560
You have to kill Dan Harmon because he's

45:10.560 --> 45:13.880
going to, throughout history, be one of the worst

45:13.880 --> 45:15.360
people that ever existed.

45:15.360 --> 45:16.840
I'm going to do a whole concert about how

45:16.840 --> 45:19.080
I want to get killed by a black woman, for instance.

45:19.080 --> 45:19.640
Really, all right.

45:19.640 --> 45:22.280
Yeah, so if you want to stop that, you better kill me.

45:22.280 --> 45:25.080
Now, you live in a world, Paul, where there's magic.

45:25.080 --> 45:26.080
You have spells.

45:26.080 --> 45:27.160
You can do anything you want.

45:27.160 --> 45:28.400
Or you could be as crude.

45:28.400 --> 45:32.400
It could be a nighttime attack with a bottle opener.

45:32.400 --> 45:33.720
You could do anything you wanted.

45:33.720 --> 45:36.440
Or there could be magic spells.

45:36.440 --> 45:37.840
Well, my first instinct, I'm going

45:37.840 --> 45:39.120
to go with my first instinct here.

45:39.120 --> 45:41.680
When you said magic, I said voodoo dolls

45:41.680 --> 45:45.040
don't get enough play in this world.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.840
And I think that would be a real fun way

45:47.840 --> 45:50.280
to get in someone's head, where they don't know what's

45:50.280 --> 45:50.780
going on.

45:50.780 --> 45:52.120
But their hands are like, ugh.

45:52.120 --> 45:53.560
And they could have them choke themselves.

45:53.560 --> 45:55.080
You could light that on fire.

45:55.080 --> 45:59.360
You could make them walk into a wall.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.400
I never understood that science, yeah.

46:01.400 --> 46:03.080
Like in the Disney movies, when they eventually

46:03.080 --> 46:04.360
they're taking the doll and going like that.

46:04.360 --> 46:05.560
And the guy's like moonwalking.

46:05.560 --> 46:06.360
But it's like, well, wait.

46:06.360 --> 46:07.760
How come every time you move it around,

46:07.760 --> 46:09.840
he doesn't like float around?

46:09.840 --> 46:11.680
I guess you have to activate it in some way.

46:11.680 --> 46:15.600
Yeah, I think a voodoo doll, and you could prolong it a little.

46:15.600 --> 46:17.640
But you could make it a little weird.

46:17.640 --> 46:19.280
How do you start toying with the voodoo doll?

46:19.280 --> 46:21.200
And then how do you finally finish the job?

46:21.200 --> 46:22.720
Well, I think in the beginning, it

46:22.720 --> 46:25.600
would just be simple slaps in the face.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.920
And just general like a real thing.

46:27.920 --> 46:29.680
This is a Total Adam Sandler movie.

46:29.680 --> 46:32.480
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

46:32.480 --> 46:34.240
Oh, then that would get a remote control

46:34.240 --> 46:37.040
that would control your life and fast forward rewind.

46:37.040 --> 46:42.040
50 Nights in Haiti.

46:42.040 --> 46:43.800
Why is that old?

46:43.800 --> 46:46.280
That was the weirdest groan I've ever heard in my life.

46:46.280 --> 46:47.880
Well, because I think people know, oh,

46:47.880 --> 46:50.240
something bad happened in Haiti.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.520
Even though that's years ago.

46:52.520 --> 46:58.000
Or every day to the point where, I mean, who's going to Haiti

46:58.000 --> 46:58.280
this week?

46:58.280 --> 47:00.160
I don't know what they think is the worst part.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.720
As an audience, you all didn't.

47:01.720 --> 47:03.640
You all are like, oh, too soon.

47:03.640 --> 47:06.640
Too soon to rag on an Adam Sandler movie?

47:06.640 --> 47:07.600
No, they like that.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.520
I said, it was the word Haiti.

47:09.520 --> 47:14.320
They reacted to it like it was like building seven or something.

47:14.320 --> 47:15.160
Me, what, building seven?

47:15.160 --> 47:16.800
No reaction, not even a bad one.

47:16.800 --> 47:17.400
Like, yeah, yeah.

47:17.400 --> 47:18.400
Look it up.

47:18.400 --> 47:21.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.360
So yeah, I think you would start to build the craziness

47:24.360 --> 47:27.080
in with the slaps, weird things like all of a sudden,

47:27.080 --> 47:28.880
you're laying in bed and you're like, shoot up.

47:28.880 --> 47:30.960
And like, I don't know why I can't lay down.

47:30.960 --> 47:37.160
Like, to really a week full of just funny, weird slapstick.

47:37.160 --> 47:39.760
And then, you know, walking into walls and stuff like that.

47:39.760 --> 47:44.320
And then I think it would be, I would light a fire,

47:44.320 --> 47:45.320
then I put it on ice.

47:45.320 --> 47:47.000
And I think those sensations, I'd go

47:47.000 --> 47:49.120
through sensations, a lot of sensations.

47:49.120 --> 47:52.360
And then, to talk about drowning, is Daniel-

47:52.360 --> 47:55.520
So if you had to kill me, you'd torture me.

47:58.520 --> 48:00.000
Well, look, we're talking about you're

48:00.000 --> 48:01.240
a pretty evil guy.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.360
And I want to make sure you get your just deserve.

48:03.360 --> 48:04.880
I don't want to make sure that, you know,

48:04.880 --> 48:06.080
I don't want to make it easy on you.

48:06.080 --> 48:07.600
If you were like, I have to kill you

48:07.600 --> 48:10.160
to save the life of a child, yeah, guillotine.

48:10.160 --> 48:12.520
But if you're going to be like the next whatever,

48:12.520 --> 48:16.080
you know, Boko Haram, I need to make sure that you take-

48:16.080 --> 48:18.080
From Haiti?

48:18.080 --> 48:18.580
Ooh.

48:23.360 --> 48:25.760
Yeah, so then I would, then I think the final thing

48:25.760 --> 48:27.880
would submerge the guy.

48:27.880 --> 48:30.120
I don't understand why me being more evil requires

48:30.120 --> 48:31.320
me to suffer longer.

48:31.320 --> 48:33.800
Don't you think that you would want to suffer?

48:33.800 --> 48:34.600
You're saying that you do.

48:34.600 --> 48:36.680
But you don't even know what I've done yet, first of all.

48:36.680 --> 48:37.180
Why me?

48:37.180 --> 48:38.920
OK, Dan, I know we're learning is the-

48:38.920 --> 48:39.920
Dan, counterpoint.

48:39.920 --> 48:41.200
I want to put a doll of him.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.080
He's a torturer.

48:42.080 --> 48:44.600
How do you kill Paul Scher?

48:44.600 --> 48:47.480
It's hard to not just do another voodoo doll on him,

48:47.480 --> 48:50.360
you know, so that whenever I feel like my knee get hot,

48:50.360 --> 48:54.160
I can pull out it and go like yank on his dick or something.

48:54.160 --> 48:54.660
Yeah.

48:54.660 --> 49:00.060
And then slow down the yanking and make it more gentle

49:00.060 --> 49:03.740
to the extent that the heat on my knee was more comfortable.

49:03.740 --> 49:06.860
And then we'd find an understanding.

49:06.860 --> 49:09.260
I mean, but let's turn this into a win.

49:09.260 --> 49:11.260
Hurt each other enough.

49:11.260 --> 49:13.180
We can just go to restaurants together and just-

49:13.180 --> 49:16.060
Now that's an Adam Sandler movie.

49:16.060 --> 49:17.420
Now we're talking.

49:17.420 --> 49:18.420
In Haiti.

49:18.420 --> 49:23.300
It's called, Haiti's going to hate.

49:27.780 --> 49:30.340
Nobody grown that?

49:30.340 --> 49:32.180
But there should be a company that does that.

49:32.180 --> 49:33.860
I don't get why there isn't like,

49:33.860 --> 49:35.460
if you find out that you're dying,

49:35.460 --> 49:37.220
like there should be a company that says,

49:37.220 --> 49:38.780
OK, well, like, how do you want to die?

49:38.780 --> 49:41.060
Like, you want to get fucking eaten by a bear?

49:41.060 --> 49:42.140
Great, we'll set that up.

49:42.140 --> 49:44.740
Like, yeah, we'll set it up like whatever you want.

49:44.740 --> 49:46.980
You want to be shot in like a dry body?

49:46.980 --> 49:48.780
But wouldn't you want to, like, in a way,

49:48.780 --> 49:51.020
I think this is maybe a Dennis Leary bit.

49:51.020 --> 49:53.660
So Dennis Leary, Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll,

49:53.660 --> 49:54.220
I'll give this to you.

49:54.220 --> 49:56.460
But why don't you use these people?

49:56.460 --> 50:00.900
Were you just doing a shout out to an FX show?

50:00.900 --> 50:05.180
Sex, Drugs, Rock and Roll.

50:05.180 --> 50:10.580
I think his name in that show is like Steve Rock and Roll.

50:10.580 --> 50:13.660
His last name is pretty amazing.

50:13.660 --> 50:15.260
So I would do it like you would just

50:15.260 --> 50:17.300
go out like in a stunt from Fast and Furious.

50:17.300 --> 50:18.140
Like, that would be great.

50:18.140 --> 50:19.460
Like, sell your body to a movie.

50:19.460 --> 50:21.940
Like, yeah, you fucking get to drive Vin Diesel's car

50:21.940 --> 50:23.700
through those buildings in Abu Dhabi.

50:23.700 --> 50:25.100
Like, I would be.

50:25.100 --> 50:26.020
I would go out like that.

50:26.020 --> 50:29.020
Like, if you could arrange to have an on-screen fatality.

50:29.020 --> 50:29.980
Yeah, like that.

50:29.980 --> 50:30.380
Yeah.

50:30.380 --> 50:31.700
And that they would put it in the movie.

50:31.700 --> 50:32.780
Exactly.

50:32.780 --> 50:35.660
Like, you get so straight in for like all old people

50:35.660 --> 50:37.020
that are ready to die.

50:42.020 --> 50:43.300
Jumping out of cars.

50:43.300 --> 50:48.020
Put the, on your new headstone, there's a video screen,

50:48.020 --> 50:49.820
like an afford explorer.

50:49.820 --> 50:52.140
And it's just like a loop of the fucking like.

50:52.140 --> 50:52.940
Oh, that would be the best.

50:52.940 --> 50:54.980
This Ferrari going through.

50:54.980 --> 50:57.220
And then people could start going, well, shit,

50:57.220 --> 50:59.380
let's make like a Milo and Otis movie with old people.

51:01.780 --> 51:03.780
Because they had to kill like a million dogs and cats

51:03.780 --> 51:04.540
to make that movie.

51:04.540 --> 51:07.980
That would be the story of two old people crossing the country

51:07.980 --> 51:09.100
to get back to their owner.

51:09.100 --> 51:11.460
And then it's just like an old lady in a box going down a river

51:11.460 --> 51:12.820
and like, whoa, help me.

51:12.820 --> 51:15.620
And it's like, you can see the different actors in each cut

51:15.620 --> 51:17.060
in each shot.

51:17.060 --> 51:19.380
And it's like, wow, 45.

51:19.380 --> 51:20.500
I love that.

51:20.500 --> 51:21.220
I'm in.

51:21.220 --> 51:22.100
Yes.

51:22.100 --> 51:24.060
Hollywood make that happen.

51:24.060 --> 51:26.460
All people were hurt during the making of this film.

51:26.460 --> 51:27.140
Everyone.

51:27.140 --> 51:29.820
And then there's like a gray ribbon or whatever

51:29.820 --> 51:30.700
the symbol for it is.

51:30.700 --> 51:31.980
It's like, they wanted to be.

51:31.980 --> 51:32.620
Yeah, they wanted to be.

51:32.620 --> 51:34.100
They wanted to go out there, tired of being

51:34.100 --> 51:35.780
dicked around by pharmaceutical companies.

51:35.780 --> 51:37.780
And they were like, can I be in a kick-ass movie with Vin

51:37.780 --> 51:40.100
Diesel about me fucking braving the rapids?

51:40.100 --> 51:43.980
Yeah, be the best.

51:43.980 --> 51:47.180
Were there really a lot of cats and dogs killed in the making

51:47.180 --> 51:47.680
of it?

51:47.680 --> 51:50.260
I haven't looked it up on Snopes, but I do believe.

51:50.260 --> 51:51.020
I mean, that is the.

51:51.020 --> 51:52.100
You have to believe it.

51:52.100 --> 51:53.220
Yeah, right?

51:53.220 --> 51:55.780
I think it was a Japanese production or something

51:55.780 --> 51:56.460
like that.

51:56.460 --> 51:59.020
There's got to be a Milo notice expert in here, right?

51:59.020 --> 52:01.460
Well, I also heard that Dudley Moore would strangle a dog

52:01.460 --> 52:03.260
every time he did voiceover work for it.

52:03.260 --> 52:04.740
Would you mind coming up?

52:04.740 --> 52:06.940
Oh, well, you had, well, two.

52:06.940 --> 52:08.300
We've got two.

52:08.300 --> 52:09.180
Two guys and one.

52:09.180 --> 52:10.900
Sitting right next to each other.

52:10.900 --> 52:12.940
Let's bring them both up, and they both have to come up.

52:12.940 --> 52:16.260
Well, let's let the first guy, his hand was up first.

52:16.260 --> 52:18.940
No, you, sir, yes, please, if you're willing.

52:18.940 --> 52:20.060
OK, great.

52:20.060 --> 52:22.620
And if he's, you know, we'll let you mean

52:22.620 --> 52:24.180
genome, like a professional wrestler.

52:24.180 --> 52:26.260
Take the chair from your beard, sir.

52:26.260 --> 52:28.540
All right, so what have you heard about Milo notice,

52:28.540 --> 52:29.220
and what do you know?

52:29.220 --> 52:30.820
And first up, what's your name?

52:30.820 --> 52:31.220
Adam.

52:31.220 --> 52:31.940
Hello, Adam.

52:31.940 --> 52:33.540
Hi, nice to meet you, everybody.

52:33.540 --> 52:35.220
Let me regale you all with the heart where we stand.

52:35.220 --> 52:36.780
Did you get everybody's name?

52:36.780 --> 52:39.140
You, sir, you, sir.

52:39.140 --> 52:41.380
Yeah, this was messed up, especially

52:41.380 --> 52:43.060
because I love this movie, know, as a kid.

52:43.060 --> 52:44.580
And then you grow up, and you find out

52:44.580 --> 52:47.340
that this Japanese company, not only did they, like,

52:47.340 --> 52:49.260
literally the scene where the cat, like, falls out,

52:49.260 --> 52:51.820
they were just taking cats and just throwing it off this cliff.

52:51.820 --> 52:54.340
Just to get this shot, and you see the cats, like, ah, not good.

52:54.340 --> 52:55.180
Do it again.

52:55.180 --> 52:56.780
But, like, wait, what do you mean you see?

52:56.780 --> 52:57.260
You see footage?

52:57.260 --> 52:59.700
Like, you see in the movie, you see the cat falling off

52:59.700 --> 53:01.620
the cliff, and it's like, literally, what they did

53:01.620 --> 53:03.900
was they just took live cats and threw them off a cliff

53:03.900 --> 53:04.580
till they got the shot.

53:04.580 --> 53:05.620
But you heard that.

53:05.620 --> 53:06.660
I just want to, like, track down.

53:06.660 --> 53:08.060
Yeah, I heard the same thing.

53:08.060 --> 53:11.180
But do you know how credible is that information?

53:11.180 --> 53:15.020
It's Dudley Moore, who did the voiceover for it,

53:15.020 --> 53:16.820
admitted that it's one of his biggest regrets

53:16.820 --> 53:19.140
that he was a part of the project when that came out.

53:19.140 --> 53:21.260
Like, not as, like, he, literally.

53:21.260 --> 53:23.780
It is still, there's still a sliver of possibility

53:23.780 --> 53:27.580
that Dudley Moore was simply told as same as I was.

53:27.580 --> 53:28.700
Because he wasn't there.

53:28.700 --> 53:30.860
It's like, like, he was, like, Dudley, stand in the bushes

53:30.860 --> 53:33.660
and be the voice of the cat, and he was like.

53:33.660 --> 53:34.500
And by the way.

53:34.500 --> 53:36.900
What are they doing over there?

53:36.900 --> 53:38.740
Oh, pull-ups.

53:38.740 --> 53:42.380
I think if he was to look back at the mass execution

53:42.380 --> 53:45.180
of cats and dogs, and Arthur, too, maybe he would think.

53:45.180 --> 53:46.500
Yeah, he would have, he would have waited.

53:46.500 --> 53:48.020
Arthur, too, on the rocks, maybe.

53:48.020 --> 53:50.300
Hey, brother, can you spare a billion dollars?

53:50.300 --> 53:52.300
That's a sign on the poster.

53:52.300 --> 53:54.820
But, but, yeah, I mean, I just, I'm just, I'm not,

53:54.820 --> 53:57.340
I'm not trying to investigate or debunk you.

53:57.340 --> 54:00.140
I'm just curious, like, because I hear it,

54:00.140 --> 54:02.260
and then I go, like, I never know the, you know,

54:02.260 --> 54:03.100
I never know.

54:03.100 --> 54:04.900
We thought you worked for, like, the ASPCAs.

54:04.900 --> 54:07.700
Sometimes I spread shit, and then later I look it up,

54:07.700 --> 54:09.820
and I'm like, I've been spreading this shit for three years,

54:09.820 --> 54:13.460
you know, like, and I want to, like, you know, like.

54:13.460 --> 54:14.300
Take it all back.

54:14.300 --> 54:15.820
Yeah, and I can't, and I can't.

54:15.820 --> 54:16.660
It's out there.

54:16.660 --> 54:19.140
How do I want to die at a Japanese production company

54:19.140 --> 54:21.500
killing me for defaming their credibility?

54:21.500 --> 54:23.620
You know what, the fact that it wasn't made in the States

54:23.620 --> 54:26.420
makes me think that definitely animals died.

54:26.420 --> 54:27.740
I don't know how many.

54:27.740 --> 54:30.100
Like, I just feel like, yeah, they didn't care.

54:30.100 --> 54:32.180
There's no ASA, you know, ASCPA.

54:32.180 --> 54:33.900
I've heard, I've heard anecdotal stuff.

54:33.900 --> 54:35.060
There's no CPAs on set.

54:35.060 --> 54:38.500
Under the subheading of that, of that legend,

54:38.500 --> 54:40.500
whatever, if it's true or not.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.500
Okay, we got a, we love Harmontown.

54:42.500 --> 54:43.740
Well, it's like a town meeting.

54:43.740 --> 54:46.140
We got a research department in the audience.

54:46.140 --> 54:47.340
A.V. Club article.

54:47.340 --> 54:49.180
Yes, animals were harmed.

54:49.180 --> 54:52.300
21 films and TV shows that killed or hurt animals.

54:52.300 --> 54:55.500
Oh, luck killed a bunch of animals, and that's HBO.

54:55.500 --> 54:58.260
Number one is electrocuting an elephant, 1903.

54:58.260 --> 54:59.580
Okay, snobs.

54:59.580 --> 55:04.420
Of course, that was Edison, of course.

55:04.420 --> 55:06.580
And then stagecoach and Ben Hur as you might imagine.

55:06.580 --> 55:07.780
Jesse James, okay.

55:07.780 --> 55:10.540
Ben Hur, a fucking guy dies to keep it in the picture.

55:10.540 --> 55:12.340
Heaven's Gate, 1903.

55:12.340 --> 55:15.260
I just heard that, you know,

55:15.260 --> 55:16.780
this is a comedy show, right?

55:16.780 --> 55:19.020
It used to be.

55:19.020 --> 55:21.860
We just, we went down after dead animals so hard.

55:21.860 --> 55:25.860
Well, I gotta say, Haiti definitely started us off

55:25.860 --> 55:27.700
on the wrong foot.

55:27.700 --> 55:29.700
Made it through Naked Man, killing a five-year-old

55:29.700 --> 55:30.540
with a hatchet, though.

55:30.540 --> 55:31.660
That was me.

55:31.660 --> 55:33.260
I mean, did you pull this up, sir,

55:33.260 --> 55:35.100
because Milo notice was on this list?

55:35.100 --> 55:35.940
Cause how about?

55:35.940 --> 55:36.780
It was fact checking.

55:36.780 --> 55:37.860
It was fact checking.

55:37.860 --> 55:41.980
Maybe there's no relevance to Milo notice in this article.

55:41.980 --> 55:44.420
Oh, the Adventures of Milo notice is number 21.

55:44.420 --> 55:46.860
All right, originally released in Japan in 1986,

55:46.860 --> 55:48.140
the Adventures of Milo notice depicted

55:48.140 --> 55:49.220
the best buddies relationship.

55:49.220 --> 55:52.060
But it's as cute as the film is.

55:52.060 --> 55:54.100
It's been dogged by rumors of animal cruelty.

55:54.100 --> 55:55.940
Dogged by rumors.

55:55.940 --> 56:00.940
A-minus AV club.

56:00.940 --> 56:04.260
Just like all my best episodes.

56:04.260 --> 56:05.460
Fucking A-minus.

56:05.460 --> 56:06.980
What the fuck are you?

56:06.980 --> 56:08.180
They can't give it up.

56:08.180 --> 56:10.100
They can't give it up.

56:10.100 --> 56:11.500
They're very hard to grade.

56:11.500 --> 56:12.860
You know what got an A?

56:12.860 --> 56:17.020
My last episode, they were like, yeah, get out of here.

56:17.020 --> 56:18.620
All right, particular emphasis on a claim

56:18.620 --> 56:21.980
that 20 kittens were killed in the course of filming.

56:21.980 --> 56:23.260
These are still describing the rumors.

56:23.260 --> 56:25.260
Though the rumors were never substantiated animal rights

56:25.260 --> 56:27.300
at the point that the film's end credits don't use

56:27.300 --> 56:30.620
the standard American he made association claimer.

56:30.620 --> 56:34.140
But instead a more vague, the animals used were filmed

56:34.140 --> 56:36.260
under strict supervision with the utmost care

56:36.260 --> 56:37.620
for their safety and well-being.

56:37.620 --> 56:41.180
And their interment.

56:41.180 --> 56:44.380
Regardless of off-screen abuse, a lot of what

56:44.380 --> 56:46.820
made it into the film meets any reasonable definition

56:46.820 --> 56:48.180
of animal cruelty.

56:48.180 --> 56:49.860
That's a good point.

56:49.860 --> 56:53.020
Even on screen, even if they use the same cat and dog,

56:53.020 --> 56:54.260
it's like, Jesus Christ, man.

56:54.260 --> 56:56.980
Don't work them that hard.

56:56.980 --> 56:58.580
While some of the more harrowing scenes

56:58.580 --> 57:00.300
were cut for US audiences, others remained,

57:00.300 --> 57:02.420
like the one in which the cat plunges more than 100 feet

57:02.420 --> 57:03.900
off a cliff into the ocean.

57:03.900 --> 57:05.540
Other controversial scenes include.

57:05.540 --> 57:07.140
But there's no.

57:07.140 --> 57:07.940
No one knows.

57:07.940 --> 57:08.660
There is no.

57:08.660 --> 57:10.700
It's dying with those Japanese filmmakers.

57:10.700 --> 57:11.860
It's the last one on the list.

57:11.860 --> 57:14.860
And they don't say that there's no reference to it.

57:14.860 --> 57:17.340
The one that I want to look at is, I remember as a kid,

57:17.340 --> 57:19.940
and I've only been able to see images of it online,

57:19.940 --> 57:21.540
Benji at Marine World.

57:21.540 --> 57:23.820
And they put Benji in a wetsuit.

57:23.820 --> 57:26.460
And then submerged him, made him dive.

57:26.460 --> 57:30.740
So he's wearing an old school, like 20,000 leagues

57:30.740 --> 57:35.660
under the sea kind of helmet, like a circular fishbowl helmet.

57:35.660 --> 57:38.500
And he's in his own wetsuit diving.

57:38.500 --> 57:41.500
And I'm like, well, I know this dog is under water.

57:41.500 --> 57:44.580
And I don't think that wetsuits for dogs are a thing.

57:44.580 --> 57:50.300
So I'm guessing this is inhumane.

57:50.300 --> 57:51.100
What was your name again, sir?

57:51.100 --> 57:51.600
Sorry.

57:51.600 --> 57:52.100
Adam.

57:52.100 --> 57:54.660
Adam, and what did you, oh, shit, sorry.

57:58.500 --> 58:00.940
Do you think you have a line to any more information

58:00.940 --> 58:01.780
than Adam had?

58:01.780 --> 58:03.780
There's a couple more stories about it.

58:03.780 --> 58:06.180
But like you said, everything's just still kind of covered.

58:06.180 --> 58:07.420
So still unsubstantiated.

58:07.420 --> 58:09.860
But what was your name, just so we can, Ben.

58:09.860 --> 58:10.380
All right.

58:10.380 --> 58:13.260
Well, thank you, Ben and Adam, for being our Milo notice

58:13.260 --> 58:14.980
correspondent team.

58:14.980 --> 58:19.260
Tony Macs, Tony Macs, Tony Macs.

58:19.260 --> 58:21.940
I wouldn't put that credit on your resume,

58:21.940 --> 58:27.580
though, like, Harmontown Milo notice expert.

58:27.580 --> 58:29.060
Well, let's hope, let's hope.

58:29.060 --> 58:30.820
You know, well, because Rob pointed out,

58:30.820 --> 58:32.340
I think it was Schrab, he's like, yeah,

58:32.340 --> 58:34.740
isn't that seen where the, like, it's part of the story

58:34.740 --> 58:37.780
that one of the animals hurts their leg and they're limping.

58:37.780 --> 58:41.460
And it's like, how do you, how do you train a puppy to limp?

58:41.460 --> 58:48.620
I will say, I have worked with numerous animals

58:48.620 --> 58:51.100
and none of them can be trained.

58:51.100 --> 58:53.540
They are all, they only have owners that promise you

58:53.540 --> 58:55.060
that they will be able to be trained.

58:55.060 --> 58:55.380
Oh, yeah.

58:55.380 --> 58:57.460
And then they're like, I don't know why they're not

58:57.460 --> 58:59.100
doing it now.

58:59.100 --> 59:02.460
They were doing it great yesterday.

59:02.460 --> 59:05.260
Heat vision and Jack, like Jack gets out of the jail cell

59:05.260 --> 59:07.860
because there's a German shepherd and the joke is so smart,

59:07.860 --> 59:11.740
he can talk German shepherd through a dog whistle.

59:11.740 --> 59:13.860
And it's like, yeah, the guy comes in with the German shepherd

59:13.860 --> 59:14.780
and is like, this is Bucky.

59:14.780 --> 59:17.940
And I was like, OK, well, because it says on the script

59:17.940 --> 59:19.340
that the dog does all this shit.

59:19.340 --> 59:21.500
And the guy's like, here's the three things Bucky could do.

59:21.500 --> 59:22.500
And then, yeah, he's like, and I've

59:22.500 --> 59:24.380
been working with them all week on that one thing.

59:24.380 --> 59:25.260
But OK, let's try it.

59:25.260 --> 59:26.100
Oh, all right.

59:26.100 --> 59:27.340
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

59:27.340 --> 59:29.900
It will really work if I'm in front of the dog

59:29.900 --> 59:32.460
and I have my hand on his head and I'm in the shot.

59:32.460 --> 59:33.460
Will that work for you guys?

59:33.460 --> 59:36.580
No, absolutely not because that's not the way filming goes.

59:36.580 --> 59:39.660
We can't have this dude who just appears

59:39.660 --> 59:41.220
to be training the dog in the scene.

59:41.220 --> 59:43.580
Yeah, that's why in TV shows it's always like, if the dog growls,

59:43.580 --> 59:44.460
it's like yawning.

59:44.460 --> 59:47.140
But then there's like, argh.

59:47.140 --> 59:50.140
You shot a thing on the league with a monkey.

59:50.140 --> 59:54.380
And the guy, I was in a car, the monkey got loose in a car.

59:54.380 --> 59:56.580
And he goes, don't worry if the monkey starts

59:56.580 --> 59:59.900
biting whatever the sun visor.

59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.260
He likes that.

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.340
All right, all right.

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.700
He goes, but if he starts biting you,

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:09.180
just give him these gummy bears and they will be fine.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.460
And my advantage was I was like, that's

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:11.860
shit.

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.340
I wouldn't give that to a child who's being hyper.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:17.340
Why would I then provoke the monkey

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:21.220
and then also give him something that's in the form of a human?

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.900
I wouldn't want to get that.

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.220
The most important thing being like, if he bites me,

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.780
don't defend myself?

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.780
Yeah.

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.340
Don't give him a treat.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.980
If he reverts to his savage animal instincts

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:35.620
and is following no programming whatsoever,

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:39.500
I should elevate my understanding of everything

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.500
in the universe and not react primarily.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.100
On Children's Hospital, we shot this thing

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:47.060
with a baboon and a fucking baboon.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.140
They're so scary.

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.620
They have the biggest fucking fangs.

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.900
And they brought her in and she was dressed up

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.940
like Megan Mullally's character.

01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:58.420
She was wearing a little lab coat and glasses.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.420
The baboon was?

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.420
The baboon was, yeah.

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.500
And so they had her in this chair

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:05.420
and she was just at this desk and she was just supposed to type.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.540
The joke was that we didn't know that that was not

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.420
Megan Mullally.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.340
We thought, oh, chief blah, blah, blah, we start talking to her

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.100
and we just didn't know.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.060
So the trainer, they put her in this chair

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.940
and she would just type.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.740
She would just go like on a typewriter,

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:25.660
but like a fucking maniac with such fucking hatred

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.780
and anger at the world.

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:32.260
And they told us right before we rolled,

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.260
it was me and Offerman.

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.260
Me and Offerman are supposed to be questioning the monkey,

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.260
leaning right into her face.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.820
And they go, oh, yeah.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.380
Don't look at her because that's aggressive.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.260
So don't look at her.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.660
You can look towards her, but don't look at her.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.780
And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:50.500
What is the difference between fucking looking

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.380
towards this animal and looking at it?

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:57.300
Because I don't want to get my fucking face ripped off

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:01.500
and like shat in and handed back to me.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.060
Back in New York, when we used to do stuff in New York,

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:08.260
I believe Seth Herzog brought a monkey on stage for a bit

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:11.020
like at a comedy show and the monkey ripped his ear lobe off.

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.300
Whoa.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.940
These fucking things are animals.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.740
They look like people, but they're animals.

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:21.860
You can throw your face off and rip off your balls,

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.460
and then they'll eat your hands off.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.820
And that's not all because they're animals,

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:31.460
but they're animals that understand your private parts.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.820
Like a dog doesn't go right for your fucking nuts,

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:37.540
but a shrimp is like, I know exactly what you are.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:40.020
I am 99% identical to you genetically,

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:41.100
and I'm angry at you.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.380
I know, I'm de-beat you.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.260
I'm going for the parts of you that get you passed.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.300
Literally low hanging fruit.

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:49.700
It's like blah.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:53.220
They go for your face and your fucking fingers

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.900
and your genitals.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:59.980
They go for what you'd go for if you have compassion.

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:01.380
Because that's prison fight.

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:05.260
If you weren't so lazy, this is what you would do.

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.980
I remember I talked to an animal trainer who had an orangutan,

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.860
and I was like, oh, was it like working with them?

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.820
And he goes, well, my trainer, my master trainer,

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:19.180
had an orangutan, and he goes, once they become older,

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:20.180
they get more stubborn.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.300
And you have to start to watch out for these signs.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:24.020
And he goes, he was missing his mark.

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.820
He wasn't doing his thing, and they used to live together.

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.580
And he said, I'd always say, you'd always tell a monkey,

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.540
like get me a beer, and the monkey would get him a beer,

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:33.180
and then the monkey would have a beer.

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.660
He goes, but one day he said, get me a beer,

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.620
and the monkey didn't get him a beer.

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:40.380
And he's like, now it's time.

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.420
And he goes, he walked him out into the backyard

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.340
and shot him in the back.

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.940
No.

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:48.100
No.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.300
No.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:52.860
Because he said that because I believe it was an orangutan

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.220
that when they get to a certain age,

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.860
like their headaches actually grows,

01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.740
or something like that, like a bone in their head

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:02.580
kind of pops out, and then they cannot be trained anymore.

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.900
Then they're not, they are off the grid.

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.740
So you're like, and because they are domesticated

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:10.940
and off the grid, they're doubly fucked.

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:13.340
So it was like, the only main thing was to shoot them.

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.300
It was murder.

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:17.020
But I love a Miller's crossing with an orangutan.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:17.540
What the fuck?

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:20.060
Just walking him out and pop.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.740
And not because he didn't break his leg in a horse race.

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:23.780
Like, that's sad enough.

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.620
It's like, thank you for racing and making all the money.

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:26.660
No, it's like, you've gone to a joint.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.340
It's like, you wouldn't give me a beer.

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.180
You became sentient.

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:33.980
You are not my slave anymore, Troy.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:36.060
Oh my god, I want to un-hear that.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.500
You started to evolve.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.620
You were evolving.

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.020
This was a guy.

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.940
This is an animal trainer who's master trainer.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.620
Like, he apprenticed under this guy

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:49.780
and told the story very casually.

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.940
It wasn't like a, it wasn't like, oh,

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:54.100
and he told me like 10 other amazing stories about it.

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.060
He just shot him with a gun?

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.060
He said like this, he goes, he walked him out in the back

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.860
with a gun, and poof.

01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:02.060
So I imagine that means she knows, yeah.

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.500
That could mean a lot of things, though.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.420
That could mean a lot.

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.540
Dan, Dan, was it Jim or Joel Hodgson that told us?

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:12.220
I love Lancelot Link, that show with the chimpanzees.

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.340
And I think it was Joel Hodgson, right, Harmon,

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:17.180
who told us that he knows the people that did that show.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.460
And there was these chimpanzees.

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.700
If you don't know Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp,

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:24.380
it was a show where it's like a James Bond kind of thing.

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.580
It's very funny.

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:28.300
And there was the evolution revolution with the band.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.780
And there's chimpanzees playing drums.

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:30.740
It's very fun.

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:32.980
However, we found out from our friend Joel Hodgson

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:35.820
from Mystery Science Theater fame

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:38.380
that part of training those chimps

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:41.140
was daily taking them out behind the fucking set

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:43.060
and beating them with a pipe.

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.300
And like beating them in a submission,

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.460
because these chimps at some point, they get aggressive.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.380
And they're like, I don't want to do this anymore.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:54.820
They're very muscular, very aggressive when they want to be.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.940
And they would have to take them out and beat them

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.540
within an inch of their fucking life,

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:01.380
like all the time, to get them to go put a tuxedo on

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:06.100
and pretend that they're going to put a tuxedo on.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:08.780
Their wardrobe just kept getting more and more elaborate

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:11.380
to cover up all of them.

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.860
There was a guy calling me at the end of it all.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:16.060
They have to put their own tuxedo on that.

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.820
They're like, god damn it.

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.620
Told Cindy to take this in.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:21.740
Makes me look like a fat ass.

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:24.580
If that guy beats me with a pipe one less time,

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.580
I'm not putting it on next time.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:30.180
I don't know why that made me.

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:33.620
Monkey alone in a trailer with a black eye.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:35.260
It's a terrible job.

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:37.820
Yeah, you hit it with the pipe, and then you're like,

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:41.860
now go to your dressing room and dress like a fucking witch

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.260
doctor.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.460
And he's like emin and ha, and a hump,

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:49.540
and he's just kind of got the latch on the back.

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.100
It's not funny if you're listening and you're

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.180
an animal person.

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:52.940
Yeah, well, I'm not.

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.140
Yeah, we're not making fun of it.

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.140
Yeah, we're not.

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.780
I saw on Facebook that thing where elephants are painting,

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.540
and the elephant draws a painting of an elephant,

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.580
and it's fucking a better elephant that you could draw.

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.380
And people are like, well, that's a fucking amazing.

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:08.220
I didn't know an elephant could put a paintbrush in its trunk

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:11.420
and draw a fucking perfect elephant and do it.

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.820
It turns out the way they do that is through torture

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.380
and through lots of like, people walk up to them

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.580
and they hold them by the ear, but in their hands

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:21.700
there's a nail, and there's little sticks they have.

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.420
It doesn't look like it, but what they're doing

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:25.220
is they're just jabbing them with.

01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.900
It's all through pain that they've

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:29.860
learned to do this shit.

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.100
But are the paintings good?

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:36.500
I mean, they're beautiful paintings.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.420
I would buy one of these paintings.

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.420
Yeah.

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:44.300
I would like a movie version of The Fugitive with a monkey

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.340
being like he killed a trainer, and he's like,

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:50.820
I wrongly accused monkey being chased down.

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:54.020
I was tired of playing the baron and putting a monocle

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:58.500
in and riding a tricycle, and yes, I killed my trainer,

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.980
but it was price entertainment.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:03.900
But now he's a monkey without a fucking comb.

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:08.420
June, my wife, is very adamant about monkey and monkey

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:11.780
rights, because she doesn't like that monkeys are

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:15.340
portrayed in a way that they have no control over.

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:18.460
So in the movie called Monkey Shines,

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:19.700
a monkey is a killer.

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.500
And she's like, well, that's not fair to the monkey,

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:24.140
because he can't choose his roles.

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:30.620
And so he shouldn't be portraying his race

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.620
by doing this.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:35.900
Like, you're forcing him into a role that is maybe not

01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.140
defamatory to his race.

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:41.220
But June is paranormally empathic,

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.380
because when I did your awesome podcast,

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:45.620
How Did This Get Made, which everybody should listen to.

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.620
Thank you so much.

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:54.020
She was very sincerely like Jack Frost with Michael Keaton.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.380
There was a point where she was crying.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:56.180
Yeah, she cries.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.540
She cries a lot.

01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.420
Yeah, she gets touched by these things.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:03.620
But the monkey debate was pretty amazing.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:08.420
She does not believe that dogs, monkeys, whatever,

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:10.820
they should have some sort of autonomy over the roles

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:11.740
that they are choosing.

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.700
That's why Blackfish is such a great movie,

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.700
because you're just rooting for the killer whale.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:16.940
You're like, oh, cool, man.

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.940
Yeah.

01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:21.420
Come on.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:25.940
It's like these 17-year-old interns that are like,

01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:27.780
I love, I know you were doing a bit.

01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:30.140
I mean, it's not their fault.

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:33.140
But they're like, no, it's not that trainer's fault.

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.900
But I mean, you do feel for the killer whale.

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.660
Like, you know, they've been fucking prisoner for the whole.

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.100
Yeah, but you could cut, well, why

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.060
are we having this debate?

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:44.980
But if you're young enough and you're that into animals,

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.420
you could come out of high school and be like,

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.780
I want to work at SeaWorld because I love the animals.

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:52.820
And you don't have to have been on the boat where you're

01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:54.220
pulling them out of the water.

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.300
And you're just like, oh, my god, I love this whale.

01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:58.340
You only know what you're told.

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:01.780
These are not top scientists that are in the pool going,

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:05.660
hey, here's some fish waved to the crowd.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.780
I think the top researchers are probably

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:10.540
doing some other high-level shit.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.940
Did you guys ever, the MPR, I've already talked about this,

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.220
but the MPR thing about that, it's all about monkey.

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:17.380
It's monkey stories, chimp stories and all that stuff.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.780
And one of them is the scientist who,

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.380
like there was a chimp that was in the lab

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:24.980
that knew fluent sign language.

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.140
And it was just allowed to wander around the lab.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.980
And there was a male head of the department.

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:31.980
And then there was like a funding guy who came in

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:35.700
and took him into his office and was yelling at him.

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.380
And oh, no, no, no, no, I'm sorry.

01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.980
It was the other way around.

01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:41.300
Maybe the female was the, the female scientist

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.700
was the head of the research department.

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:45.940
And she was being yelled at by a, by a male

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:48.060
who was like a, like a money guy.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.620
I'm sure I got the story wrong.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.260
I also got a million things about boat trip rock.

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.620
So just, you always have to,

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:54.900
you always have to just operate on my memory and just,

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:57.380
but the story I remember is that the monkey is,

01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:59.700
the chimp is sitting out there signing with the,

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:03.740
with a male who was like, I think a superior to the female.

01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:06.700
I have no idea if monkey, if chimps are inherently sexist

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:07.980
and he couldn't understand the hierarchy,

01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:09.820
but he, he had a hierarchy in his head

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:12.220
and was signing to the male scientist.

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:17.220
Like that, that guy's in there like, like fucking up your shit.

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.140
Like, like he's like mistreating her.

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.220
Like you need to go in there and bite him.

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.540
And, and, and the guy's like, well, we don't,

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:24.740
we don't, we don't bite each other.

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:25.660
That's not what we do.

01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.980
And, and the chimps like, you got to bite him.

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:32.980
He's, he's, look what he's in there dissing your, your woman.

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.900
Like, like, like he's, he's in there like fucking

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:36.820
with your whole thing.

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:40.540
And if you don't bite him, I'll bite you.

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:41.380
He signed this?

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.940
And the scientist was like, it was like,

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:46.260
uh, we don't bite each other's Ralph.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.580
So good day.

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.620
And then like, or, or it was, you know what?

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:51.660
It was the other way around.

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.660
It was like, that's the scariest thing about it.

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.420
I think it was the woman was signing with the chimp

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:58.100
and the guy was, the chimp was saying to the woman,

01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:01.820
tell him to bite him or I'm going to bite him later.

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:04.540
In any case, there was like this elaborate conversation

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.460
and it was like alarming.

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:08.460
And then they, and then like, uh, some time went by

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:11.380
and the male scientist was like sitting in his office.

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:14.540
Like it's just picture, like he's just laying down.

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:17.380
Chimp was like allowed to just go wherever I wanted.

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:19.140
And he just had some Xeroxes to do.

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:22.220
And like, uh, like, like the, the, the chimp, I mean,

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:24.780
and he just came in the guy's office, came across his desk

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.060
and bit his hand.

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:27.980
It's so hard that he lost like three fingers.

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:29.020
Whoa.

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.100
And he, and then he went, and then he,

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.820
and the guy was like, Jesus fucking Christ, Herman.

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.860
I, I thought, like, what the fuck is this blood everywhere?

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:38.260
God, he goes and gets his fingers reattached or whatever.

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.980
And then the, then the, the chimp, like after it just kept

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.780
going like, where's, where's Steve?

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:44.580
Like, like, like after he came back on there,

01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:47.220
it's like, uh, he's getting his fingers reattached.

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:49.980
Um, and he's like, well, uh, well, where is he?

01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:50.820
Where is he?

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:52.940
And he's like, he doesn't want to work with you anymore.

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:55.780
You bit his hand, you fucking cocksucker.

01:12:55.780 --> 01:13:01.780
And he's like, uh, well, I mean, I had to.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.500
Like, like, he sat having a conversation.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:04.620
He's like, that's what you do.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.220
He was like, I had to bite his hand.

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.060
Kind of like street law, you know what I mean?

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:10.660
And they said, you need to apologize to him.

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:13.380
And he was like, I don't know what that means or whatever.

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:14.660
Like the conversation was like, he,

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.180
he either didn't know what apologizing was

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.860
or he was like, I'm not sorry though.

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.780
You know, like in either case it was like, like, but I had to.

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:23.380
And then time went by and he kept going like, where's Steve?

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.660
And they're like, dude, you're a fucking dick.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.620
Like you, you didn't, you know that you remember Steve,

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.340
so you remember what you did.

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.660
And he's like, yeah, but whatever.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.180
And then like, like all this time went by.

01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:35.340
And then after a while he apparently was like,

01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:36.380
okay, bring Steven here.

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.580
And he gave him a hug.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.500
Like, like, like, he was like, all right,

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:44.020
you fucking pussy, now let's get to work.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.980
All right, bring me another, bring me another kitten.

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:46.940
All right, I broke his neck.

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.380
All right.

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:53.140
I want my KitKat fucking chimpanzees will rip your fuck it.

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:55.340
They're, they're, they are humorless,

01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.980
like savage fucking monsters.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:59.180
They have no compassion.

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:01.460
They're scary.

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:02.420
They don't look like us.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.300
I get it, but they're monsters.

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:05.140
They're terrifying.

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.140
Well, it's tricky.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.980
When you put a cowboy hat on anybody,

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.700
they seem more friendly, you know.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.540
I know.

01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.580
And then we want to do that, but it's like,

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.700
we shouldn't be doing that.

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:13.540
What are you drinking?

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.620
We shouldn't be, we shouldn't be dressing chimps up

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:17.700
because that's what they do to us.

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.500
That's chimp behavior to dress up a chimp.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.500
Does that make sense?

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:22.900
Is that track?

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:23.980
We're going to be more human.

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.620
That's why it's called the humane society.

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:28.300
Like, like being humane involves being nice to animals.

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.180
Unless you're eating them at every meal.

01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:32.540
Well, do you, I guess the question then is,

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.900
does it make sense to even train these monkeys to talk?

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:35.740
Because.

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:36.580
No, fuck no.

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.900
Well, no, no, no, you can't, no, you should.

01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:39.740
I guess.

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:40.580
I feel like the plan is.

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:41.420
Keep fucking with everything.

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:42.260
Yeah, you want some too?

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:43.420
A cup.

01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.260
Sorry guys.

01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.260
Yeah, I feel like the plan is to make them soldiers, right?

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.900
Like, isn't that the idea?

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:53.300
Man, the cold open of Lawnmower, man.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:55.980
The shows you how dangerous that is.

01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:56.820
We put some more.

01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:57.660
There's a cold open of Lawnmower, man.

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.460
It's like a chimp, like a Jim Henson chimp,

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.060
like going through a military base,

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.860
killing people because it's been trained

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.380
to do it in a video game.

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:07.220
Well, I mean, I mean, get out.

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.060
He's again.

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:09.220
Jim Henson chimp.

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.820
I talked, I talked into this.

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:13.660
I knew I wanted to.

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:16.380
Talk about how monkeys are so dumb.

01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.580
Monkeys don't even know how to use a microphone.

01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.060
Yeah, I mean, well, I mean,

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.020
monkeys probably have no remorse.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.420
No, I bet they don't.

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.260
They like.

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.700
It's like a terminator, like a five year old terminator

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:28.860
with a rock hard dick.

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:33.860
They, monkeys will eat baby monkeys just like for fun.

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:35.620
I mean, not for fun.

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.340
They do it for war, but they'll just like,

01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.580
monkeys will get up at like three in the morning

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.820
and like high five each other and then go into the jungle

01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:44.060
and just eat a bunch of baby monkeys

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.780
from another monkey village.

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:48.260
By the way, Spencer, the way that you are positioned

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:49.540
right now and what you just said,

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:52.300
I want to watch a, just like an Andy Rooney segment

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.660
of just you, me like just,

01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:59.660
just melancholy about monkey, it's some cold hard facts

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:01.340
about monkeys.

01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:05.180
Spencer, are you pro or con monkey?

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:08.620
I'm against, like we should not, we should not know.

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.580
I mean, we shouldn't know about monkeys.

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.420
We shouldn't see monkeys.

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:12.580
Like not know about them?

01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:15.980
No, they should just be away from us.

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:18.580
Because like, yeah, they do rip people's faces off.

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:20.220
Why are we all like, that's pretty cool.

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.580
Let's figure out why that happens.

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.780
They're ripping people's fucking faces off.

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:25.380
Well, studying them has been pretty important

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.220
to understanding ourselves.

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.220
It's dumb.

01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.060
But I mean,

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.060
Again, this show is, this show is paying off huge dividends.

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:36.780
I just want that half an hour of just monkey,

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.820
monkey facts, monkey opinions.

01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:41.500
I'm dead, I'm dead.

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.540
You wanted to be centered on monkeys.

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:43.980
I thought you were more taken, which is,

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.540
No, I just wanted to be a little monkey.

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.340
You don't talk about the creepy economy or anything.

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:49.540
Yeah, no, it's just about the monkey fact.

01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:53.340
You just resigned to this fact about,

01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:54.860
Yeah, they kill kids anyway.

01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:00.020
But I feel like the bonobos have it going on

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:02.460
because they settle all their disputes

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.660
through fucking and sucking.

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:04.820
They just jerk off all the time.

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:05.660
Do they suck too?

01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:06.500
Are the bonobos the ones with the inflamed?

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.060
They suck and suck and they masturbate

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:10.940
and they're bisexual and they're incestuous.

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:12.380
I don't know if they're the unadvertiser

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.420
on your podcast, but why would you name your company

01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:15.260
bonobos?

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:17.180
That's a big podcast advertiser.

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:19.540
Are bonobos the one with the inflamed genitalia?

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:22.940
Like they're like their assholes are like pink and rosy.

01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:23.780
Like it's like a target.

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:26.340
Well, they're the ones that are the most like us genetically.

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.180
Like they're the closest.

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.500
No, but what are their assholes like?

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:32.220
Why would you name the assseams of clothing companies?

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.340
Rob wants to know the specifics of their assholes.

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:37.580
What do their assholes look like?

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:41.820
Rob equates everybody on asshole how their assholes look.

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:44.180
You guys have seen what they do with frogs, right?

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.020
No.

01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:49.300
Google chimpanzee frog.

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.140
They fuck them.

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:51.060
And hit enter.

01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:51.900
They fuck them.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.980
And be amazed.

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:54.860
Oh, like that?

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:56.740
Like almost like a pocket money.

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:57.740
That's right.

01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:58.740
I've heard.

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.180
There's 1,000 videos.

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:00.680
No.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.460
1,000 videos.

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.580
I don't think I could watch it.

01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:06.580
Because any time a frog's ever come near a chimp,

01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:07.900
they've gone like this for a second.

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.980
And then they played with the mouse with their finger.

01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:14.660
And then they just go, I should probably a male chimp.

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:16.300
I mean, I don't think.

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:19.300
Yeah, it's like, they just do it.

01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.780
And then they throw the fucking frog away.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.780
And then there's some videos where you watch the frog

01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:24.780
like limping away.

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.780
Oh.

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:28.460
It's a comedy show.

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.620
They fuck the mouse?

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:36.060
They just use it as a flashlight?

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.060
Yeah.

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.060
Yeah.

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.580
There are research departments about it.

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:40.340
That's what we're saying.

01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:41.340
It's a very specific blog.

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:42.780
You guys can do it tonight.

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:47.500
And once we get the show running to the peak,

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:48.740
that's my dream for the show is we

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.420
need to come up with a way that we

01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.660
can have a live feed so that if they can see what the people

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:57.780
at home are seeing, then we can say, Spencer, bring up Google

01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.500
chimp and frog.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.380
And then they can be looking at it.

01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:04.780
And then the people at home can be looking at it.

01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:05.980
I don't want to watch that.

01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:06.980
I don't want to watch that.

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:10.100
It's kind of front row.

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:10.940
It's so psyched.

01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.020
It's a bad pitch.

01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.020
It's a bad pitch.

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.340
Speaking of bad pitches, why don't we

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:17.460
start playing some shadow running?

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:18.620
Yeah, well, it's DeMorge here.

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.100
DeMorge Brown, are you in town?

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.860
I didn't see him in the greenery.

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:22.860
We have no DeMorge.

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:23.780
We've got no DeMorge.

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:25.780
Oh, shit.

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:27.220
We have Rob Schrab is here.

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:28.220
Oh, Schrab.

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:29.220
Oh, right.

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:31.660
Oh, get the fuck out here.

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:37.180
Where's Rob Schrab at?

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:40.380
Where my Schrab is at?

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:42.020
Where my Rob is at?

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.620
Yo, yo.

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:44.820
Where my Schrab is at?

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:47.500
Not to the O, to the B, to the Schrab.

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:50.060
I fucked your mom so hard, it was my job.

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.700
Got a lazy rap.

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.860
And the diesel to the Rob, going to go out in the street.

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:58.220
And I got a lob, my tennis ball.

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:00.420
Rob's on this side.

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.460
All the Rob's on this side.

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:02.460
All the Rob's over here.

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:03.300
All the Rob's on this side.

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.820
All the Rob's to the left.

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:06.180
Hello, everybody.

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.380
Yay.

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.980
Glad I wore my jacket.

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:14.820
It's nice and chilly in here.

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:16.940
What's up, Rob Schrab?

01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:19.820
Eh, I feel all right.

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:24.820
Rob, if you had to go toe-to-toe at the end of your life,

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:29.580
like a battle royale, you had to fight another animal.

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:30.780
Another animal.

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:31.780
Another animal.

01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:37.620
If you could look into the netherverse and fight another animal.

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:39.180
If you could fight another animal.

01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.180
Another animal.

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:41.380
To the death.

01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:43.780
Which animal do you think that you would be equally mashed with?

01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:44.420
And which one?

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:45.100
Gorilla.

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:46.220
You would fight a gorilla?

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.100
Fuck yeah.

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:47.700
For real?

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.580
No.

01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:50.580
OK, how about this.

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.740
You get a weapon.

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:52.380
What do you mean?

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.140
You get to fight a.

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.820
I'm going to choose a gorilla.

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:56.980
Yeah, a gorilla is a weapon.

01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:58.940
Yeah, fucker, I'll kill anything.

01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:00.380
Eh, I'll take that, Rhino.

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.980
Clonies could use the gorilla as a weapon in a bunch of movies.

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:04.260
I wasn't listening to the show.

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.180
What is going on?

01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:06.740
You get to fight a gorilla.

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:10.660
Is you in a gorilla in a ring, or like in a forest?

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.460
We weren't talking about it.

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:13.820
But you get one weapon.

01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:17.180
But it's not a gun, or like an arrow, or a crossbow.

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.500
You get one melee weapon.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.500
Like what do you fight a gorilla with?

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:22.000
What?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:22.500
A knife?

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:23.420
I've hatched it.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:23.920
Why?

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.220
I'm asking you a question, Schrab.

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.980
Did he do this to you guys?

01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:28.860
No, no.

01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:29.900
Kind of.

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.340
Well, I mean, he always asks different things all the time.

01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.940
We've just been talking about happy little light subjects

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:35.420
out here.

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:37.420
All right.

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:39.460
You versus gorilla, what weapon do you bring in?

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:40.540
Schrab versus gorilla.

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:42.140
Yeah, what weapon do you bring in?

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:43.300
It can't be a gun, or a.

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.500
A sharknado.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.380
A sharknado, right?

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:49.060
No, I don't know.

01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:50.380
What's the point of this?

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:52.660
Let's say tomorrow you, let's say we.

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:53.300
I got one.

01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:54.700
Let's say we all left the building tonight.

01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:55.460
Voodoo doll.

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:56.460
Voodoo doll.

01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:57.100
Voodoo doll.

01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:57.660
Voodoo doll.

01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:58.620
Gorilla voodoo doll.

01:21:58.620 --> 01:21:59.420
Gorilla voodoo doll.

01:21:59.420 --> 01:21:59.820
OK.

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:00.700
I got it.

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:01.860
I like this.

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.580
What's up with this empty thing?

01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:04.460
This is empty.

01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:05.340
I put that there, sorry.

01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:06.340
Oh, OK.

01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:07.300
It was in your chair.

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.380
Can we get Rob's shop of beer?

01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:09.900
Yeah, let's get Rob's shop of beer.

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.220
All right, well, let's.

01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:12.300
You're drinking out of it.

01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:13.580
Don't go, he can have mine.

01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:13.980
No.

01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:14.700
I got front of Bronco.

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:15.780
All right, well, Schraba's an amazing.

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.500
Who brought the front of Bronco, by the way?

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:18.780
What's your name?

01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:19.340
Hello, Sam.

01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:20.020
Thank you so much.

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:20.700
Holy smokes.

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:22.740
Dan, what are you doing after the show tonight?

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:24.260
I know Schraba.

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:25.940
You want to go watch Nightmare on Elm Street,

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.740
because we lost Wes Craven today, I guess.

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.300
Wes Craven is dead, yeah.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:30.700
Yeah.

01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:32.140
And the funny thing is I ran into Brian Collins.

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:32.780
It's not funny.

01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:34.500
It's not funny that he died.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:35.140
It's kind of funny.

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:36.980
I said the funny thing.

01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:40.620
What was there a choice between anything?

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.580
Like, was it always?

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.500
Between, like, John Carpenter or Will Craven?

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:43.980
No, no, no.

01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.420
I mean, as far as were you saying, like,

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.060
was it always going to be Nightmare?

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:48.860
Or could it have been?

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:49.900
Oh, thank you so much.

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:52.180
Could it have been Scream 2?

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.100
What do you mean?

01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.460
I mean, like, you're going to watch Nightmare on Elm Street

01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:55.940
tonight.

01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:56.940
Oh, yeah.

01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:59.900
Was that, is there any other choice?

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:01.220
Deadly Friend.

01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:01.900
Oh, interesting.

01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:03.780
Deadly Friend is, like, one of my favorite Wes Craven movies.

01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:04.700
Deadly Friend's great.

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:05.740
Shocker?

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:07.820
Shocker, or Swamp?

01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:11.540
It's four in title, two in the pink.

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:12.740
Not two.

01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:15.340
Shocker is, what's his face in that?

01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:17.660
That's Peter Berg, right?

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.460
Peter Berg acts in Shocker.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:19.860
Right.

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.700
That was when he was, like, an 18-year-old actor.

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:23.660
There were two movies that came out when Shocker came out

01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:26.340
that were both very similar, and that was very confusing.

01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:28.420
There were two horror movies that were both about guys

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.180
who died in electric chairs, I think.

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:32.740
Was Shocker the one that goes through the electric outlets?

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.260
Yeah, I think he becomes electricity,

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:35.580
which also includes television.

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:36.260
But then there was another.

01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:37.380
Terrifying.

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:40.460
There was a, yeah, a special effects when horror always

01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:41.620
go great together.

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.580
So scary.

01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:45.380
Lawnmower, man, perfect combination of both.

01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:46.980
Horrifying.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:47.740
Wait, what?

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:49.020
So scary.

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:51.660
The one thing that's interesting about Wes Craven,

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.500
though, I feel like, is he really

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:57.340
was able to keep a consistent reinvention of himself.

01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:57.740
Yeah.

01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:01.580
When he did, when he did, uh, the Scream Queen, right?

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:03.980
I don't know if it is, Scream Queen?

01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:06.500
Is that the new show, that Scream Queen show?

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.060
Anybody?

01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:07.420
Anyone?

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:08.220
Researchers?

01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:08.860
Is it?

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.860
No.

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:13.540
It's who?

01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:15.100
No, that's Ryan Murphy.

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.580
That's American Horror Story.

01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:20.820
We all have a tiny bit of information, all of this.

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.380
We're all just regurgitating.

01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.100
Yeah, we're all just regurgitating.

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.980
Like, oh, yeah, yeah, I thought I heard that.

01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:26.700
I don't know.

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:29.300
But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:31.380
But definitely a bunch of, a bunch of animals

01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:32.700
were killed on Nightmare on Elm Street.

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:36.740
I know, I know it, I know it.

01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:39.340
The best weapon to, if you wanted to kill Wes Craven

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.980
would be a gorilla.

01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:42.180
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:43.580
All right, Dan, he just died today.

01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:44.420
Good joke.

01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:46.620
Well, fuck you.

01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.540
Wait, I cued you to do that?

01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:53.700
So what do you think?

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:54.860
I'm sad he's dead.

01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:56.660
No, after the show.

01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:59.340
The only reason that game is to guilt you into hanging out

01:24:59.340 --> 01:24:59.840
with me.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:00.340
No, no.

01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:01.020
You're going to watch it.

01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:01.980
Well, all right, I'll hang out.

01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.540
Do you think it's possible?

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:04.540
This might be a bad pitch.

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.260
Can we do it at my place, because my dogs?

01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:08.060
Yes, I would love to do it at your place,

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:10.020
because I live right in between both of you.

01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:13.340
Do you guys know there's an audience here?

01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:14.700
Wes Craven died.

01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:18.460
He doesn't return my text.

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:19.380
He doesn't.

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.180
You guys could call each other.

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:22.660
You could email each other.

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:23.820
He doesn't pick up.

01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:26.180
You don't have to invite all of these people

01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:28.140
and all of those people.

01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:30.740
I was writing for the last, like, three weeks I've been trying.

01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:35.740
You've been writing since 1993.

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:36.900
Let's be serious.

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.700
When is it going to stop?

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:41.380
When are you going to have time to hang out with me?

01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:49.660
I got to go to a marathon of something I did.

01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.300
Speaking of lines, it would be great in a trailer

01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:53.180
for a concert movie.

01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.860
That's part of the reason you guys came here,

01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:57.220
because you're coming out with this concert movie you did.

01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:58.420
Oh, yeah.

01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:02.020
We did a comedy special in one take on a moving bus.

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.020
Concert movies are misnomer, though.

01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.260
Because you're not going to go out to theaters and watch them.

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:08.700
It does happen in one night on a glass bus.

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:12.260
Yeah, we just basically, she and I made the show called

01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:16.540
Crash Test, where we got this fucking insane glass tube.

01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.140
And we drove around all of Hollywood.

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:20.100
Most buses, like, you face the driver.

01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:22.020
And this one, you face the street.

01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:23.660
And it's like stadium seating.

01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:25.820
And the street becomes the stage.

01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.340
Yeah, so we just called all of our comedy friends

01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:29.140
and said, like, be in.

01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.260
Didn't call me.

01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.180
We did, as a matter of fact.

01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:33.980
You gave us permission to get to the community stage.

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:34.480
Yeah.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.140
Oh, that's right.

01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:38.140
Yeah, you were calling Joel McHale through me.

01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:39.620
That's what happened.

01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:41.340
But so we just drove all around Hollywood

01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.860
and went to everybody's house.

01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.340
And they just came out in their front yard

01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:45.860
and did, like, a bit with us.

01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:48.100
And then the bus just keeps going.

01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:48.940
It was so fun.

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:49.540
It was so fun.

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:50.780
So we made it into a special.

01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:51.980
And it's on Vimeo.

01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:53.260
Yeah, Vimeo on demand.

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.140
Was it called?

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:54.980
Crash Test.

01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:55.860
Vimeo.

01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:57.860
But it.

01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:59.460
No new taxes.

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:03.740
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:09.540
We have all of our comedy friends, Reno 911, Reno 911

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:11.420
reunion, and Earl Swechert, who we've

01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:14.260
been doing comedy with for, God, like the last 10 years,

01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:15.580
you know, of the odd future.

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:16.820
We grew up with them.

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.940
And it's literally like every funny comedy person

01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:21.580
you've ever seen, and then Earl Swechert.

01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:23.140
He's awesome, but it's just like, what was he?

01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:26.540
In your trailer, it does like a Tarantino kind of boom,

01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.220
boom, boom, of all the last names of, like,

01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.860
look at all this fucking A-list people.

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:31.900
And then one of the, it's all the last names,

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:36.820
and sorry, Cordry, Rudd, whatever, that it's like a Swechert.

01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:37.820
Swechert.

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:38.980
That makes me laugh every time.

01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:41.220
It operates on two levels, because it's just

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:43.220
the name of an object.

01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:46.820
That's the only level, really, that it operates on.

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:49.660
But you were the only, like, Paramount

01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:52.500
let us shoot on their back lot, and basically they're like,

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:55.060
yeah, you can shoot anywhere you want on their back lot.

01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:57.260
Everything will be closed, and we won't turn on any lights

01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:58.180
for you.

01:27:58.180 --> 01:27:58.940
Oh.

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.820
And then Dan was the one who let us at least

01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:04.260
open a stage door, so you get to see the set of community

01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:06.980
and the amazing banner that you had out in front of set.

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.900
Sounds like a good friend.

01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:08.400
Uh.

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:08.900
Uh.

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:09.400
Uh.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:09.900
Uh.

01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:10.400
Uh.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:10.900
Uh.

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:13.300
No, it's a, the.

01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.220
I love Schrab's criticisms of you,

01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:16.620
because they're all compliments.

01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:18.900
Like, you've been writing since 1993.

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:19.780
Yeah, I know.

01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:21.900
Go to the unerror box, I mean, that.

01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.020
What a put down.

01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:25.020
Right.

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:25.520
So.

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:26.020
Uh.

01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:26.520
Uh.

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:27.020
Uh.

01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:27.700
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:28.220
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:31.280
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's kind of.

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.060
Right?

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:32.380
Yeah.

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:34.460
So you're going to say a funny thing about my set.

01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:37.200
Besides that, that you can go by the Greendale college.

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.720
You have this banner says nominated for zero Emmy.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.280
Uh, hanging up.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:45.300
Put that up for morale, you know, it's, it's one of the funniest

01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:48.060
things that just suddenly they're right by inject McBrayer.

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:49.100
And you know what?

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:52.260
That was the smartest investment show ever made because I got

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:54.300
to use that sign for three years in a row.

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.300
It paid for itself.

01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.300
That's called amortization.

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.300
That's something Sony never appreciated.

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:02.300
I amortized.

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:05.300
Hey, Dan, do you think that we can all play some Shadowrun together with this group?

01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:07.300
I think so, yeah.

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:10.300
It's not our finest moment for feminism, but we'll...

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.300
You want me to do sound effects?

01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:14.300
Yeah.

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.300
Okay, Rob will do sound effects.

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:20.300
No, you're probably going to need to be a character, because we need everybody that we got up here.

01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:23.300
So, no sound effects.

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:25.300
Rob, follow your heart with sound effects.

01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:27.300
If you feel like a sound needs to be affected,

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.300
I'll feel the room.

01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.300
I'll feel the room.

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:33.300
Well, if you want to...

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:35.300
It would be a number of mics, because...

01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:37.300
Where did we land on you guys getting together after the show?

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:39.300
I...

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:41.300
If it's at my place.

01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:43.300
Yes, yes.

01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:45.300
I met my wife at Schrab's apartment.

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:47.300
That is true.

01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:49.300
Schrab's apartment was my old apartment.

01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:51.300
Is that true?

01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:53.300
Yeah.

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:55.300
Schrab introduced me to my wife.

01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:57.300
No reaction.

01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.300
What?

01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:01.300
Oh.

01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.300
Schrab...

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:05.300
But my wife is half Japanese, so she's half responsible for Milo and Otis.

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:07.300
Wow.

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.300
How many cats did your wife throw off a cliff?

01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.300
Like, what's half of 36?

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:13.300
18.

01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:15.300
Schrab, last great West Craven movie go.

01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:17.300
Excuse me.

01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:19.300
Oh, shit.

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:21.300
Um...

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:23.300
Well, I mean, Scream is like...

01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:25.300
That is pretty...

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:27.300
It's game-changing.

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:29.300
Would you say it brought back horror?

01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:31.300
I think it brought it to a new level.

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:33.300
I mean, it was like one of the first...

01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.300
It brought meta to contemporary...

01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:37.300
To the people.

01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:39.300
You know, like...

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.300
I mean, it helped out this guy here

01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:43.300
with his...

01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:45.300
shit that he does on television.

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:47.300
Wow.

01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:49.300
Now the insults are really flying.

01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:51.300
Warmed up the room for him a little bit.

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.300
Um...

01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.300
Should I talk?

01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:57.300
It's not... No, you should never talk.

01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.300
Okay. Sound effects.

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:01.300
Oh, no, no, no. You're playing Erin McGathy's character.

01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:03.300
Oh, my God. Okay.

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:05.300
Oh, my God.

01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:07.300
Oh, my God.

01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:09.300
Oh, my God.

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.300
Oh, my God.

01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:13.300
Oh, my God.

01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:15.300
Now, Paul and Rob,

01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:17.300
do you guys understand how Shadowrun works?

01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:19.300
Absolutely.

01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:21.300
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.300
If you see a Shadowrun,

01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:25.300
Rob, just run like shit.

01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:27.300
That's an idea.

01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:29.300
Rob, what character...

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:31.300
Rob Hubel.

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:33.300
Hubel, what character do you have?

01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:35.300
I lost it.

01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:37.300
Are you Dr. Friend, by any chance?

01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:39.300
Yeah.

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:41.300
Goddamn it.

01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:43.300
This fucking stutter.

01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:45.300
I'm Dr. Friend.

01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:47.300
Paul, you're Dr. Friend.

01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:49.300
I don't even pay attention to this shit.

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.300
Who are you, Hubel?

01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:53.300
I'm just hanging out.

01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:55.300
Oh, you're Hordegaard.

01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:57.300
Hordegaard is kind of a what?

01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:59.300
He's a dwarf German.

01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:01.300
He's like a German doctor.

01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:03.300
No, no. A German psychic.

01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:05.300
Hordegaard's a dwarf.

01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:07.300
German, but clearly German.

01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:09.300
He's Dutch, I think.

01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:11.300
He's from Oslo.

01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:13.300
Oh, it's Norwegian.

01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:15.300
Okay, so do your best Norwegian.

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:17.300
And Paul, you are...

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:19.300
Dr. Friend.

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:21.300
He's a troll.

01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:23.300
A troll doctor.

01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:25.300
A male troll doctor

01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:27.300
who has an armor jacket.

01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:29.300
Yes.

01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:31.300
He's kind of a mob doctor archetype.

01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.300
He's like a black market doctor

01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:35.300
who travels with us.

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:37.300
Hordegaard is kind of an eye in the sky.

01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:39.300
He can kind of see...

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.300
...your map, like, when we need...

01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:43.300
I feel like we shouldn't waste time

01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.300
of your listeners and your audience

01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:47.300
explaining, let's just fucking do it.

01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:49.300
I mean, what's the worst that could happen?

01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:51.300
Like, I'm gonna fucking swallow a snail.

01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:53.300
Yeah.

01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:57.300
Oh, yeah.

01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:59.300
Previously on Harmon Run Shadow Time,

01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:01.300
enraged that their Johnson had double-crossed them

01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.300
with a ghoul magnet-trapped briefcase,

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:05.300
Dr. Friend and Eve Libertine

01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:07.300
decided to combine forces

01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:09.300
in seeking righteous retribution.

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:11.300
Eve summoned a spirit eagle

01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:13.300
for a delivery system

01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:15.300
for a rage-empowered agony spell.

01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:17.300
Hordegaard contributed to the revenge cocktail

01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:19.300
with General Psychic Fusion.

01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:21.300
And Jim Nightblade,

01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:23.300
not wanting to dampen the synergy,

01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:25.300
openly declared as sexuality

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:27.300
because the only thing that is more powerful

01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:29.300
than a secret is the secret's exposure.

01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:31.300
The doctor quickly restored

01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:33.300
the drained Eve,

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.300
allowing her to summon

01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:37.300
an additional spirit sparrow

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:39.300
to search after the Johnson.

01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:41.300
And the gang searched their souls

01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:43.300
and evaluated their recent exploits and setbacks.

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:45.300
Time to get paid,

01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:47.300
or time to get some paid back,

01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:49.300
or time to pay Shadow Run Style.

01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:53.300
All right.

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:55.300
Can you say that all like...

01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:59.300
Spencer, who wrote that for us?

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:01.300
That was by Pat Spenogl.

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.300
What?

01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:05.300
Pat Spenogl.

01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:07.300
Pat Spenogl.

01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:09.300
You're not even writing the stuff anymore?

01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:11.300
No, man, I have sources.

01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:13.300
He's like Jim Davis, like, year 9 of Garfield.

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.300
Oh, man.

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:17.300
I just like, I don't know.

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:19.300
Is that true? Is it Jim Davis?

01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:21.300
Spencer, did my sparrow...

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:23.300
What has happened just the last time I've been here?

01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:25.300
Spencer, did my mystic sparrow find anything?

01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:27.300
He's reading off his phone?

01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.300
Yeah.

01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:31.300
We have guest writers for it.

01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.300
What to do?

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.300
Let's see what we got to...

01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:37.300
Spencer, did my sparrow find

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:39.300
the driver of the car

01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:41.300
that left us holding the bag?

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:43.300
You just sent it out, but not yet.

01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:45.300
It might take some time.

01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:47.300
Okay, I'll hold tight on that one.

01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:49.300
Shit.

01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:51.300
I mean, all right.

01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:53.300
So we are...

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.300
You're in a parking lot.

01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:57.300
There's zombies, ghouls.

01:34:57.300 --> 01:34:59.300
They're kind of just cruising around, though.

01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:01.300
They're not meanin' you any harm.

01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:03.300
How many shadows?

01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:05.300
There's, like, seven shadows.

01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:07.300
Get the fuck out, man!

01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.300
You gotta get the fuck out!

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:11.300
You gotta run, man!

01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:13.300
Well, guys, I say we...

01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:15.300
I say we go...

01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.300
I say we go our separate ways.

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.300
Wait for another shadow run to call us.

01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:21.300
Why don't we go back to that bar?

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:23.300
What's the bar called that we all hang out at?

01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:25.300
Where the Johnson's hang out?

01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:27.300
Hank's Last Dance.

01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:29.300
Let's go to Hank's Last Dance.

01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.300
I'll have a drink.

01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:35.300
I call an Uber and we go to Hank's Last Dance.

01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:37.300
What time are we in?

01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:39.300
2050... what?

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.300
2070 something.

01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:43.300
So this is when monkeys are all gone, right?

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.300
There's no such thing as monkeys.

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:47.300
So there's no beholders or dragons or anything?

01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:49.300
Oh, there's dragons.

01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:51.300
Well, there's dragons. There's no beholders. There's no monkeys.

01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:53.300
Thank God.

01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:55.300
It's magical, Rob.

01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:57.300
Yeah, there's magic.

01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:59.300
I'm already disappointed.

01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:01.300
We don't lose any points for the data mining

01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:03.300
that Uber will take from us, right?

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.300
Not these days.

01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.300
You don't even have any data.

01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:09.300
It's safe at all.

01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:11.300
I had 11 Uber drivers reject me before getting in.

01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:13.300
I had to drive myself here.

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.300
Wait.

01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.300
Is this Rob Schrober or is this a character?

01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:19.300
No, this is me saying this.

01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:21.300
I thought it was your character.

01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:23.300
No, it's not a character.

01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:25.300
No, I had to drive myself.

01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:27.300
Mercy, you're our face man.

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:31.300
Why did so many drivers reject you?

01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:33.300
Rob Schrober.

01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:35.300
No, you're Mercy O'Donnell.

01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:37.300
Okay, well, I'll tell you later,

01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:41.300
as myself,

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:45.300
11, 11.

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:47.300
Do you have a low school?

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.300
Mercy, you're so charming.

01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:51.300
You have the prettiest face in town.

01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.300
This is true.

01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.300
You're so charming.

01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:57.300
Why would so many drivers reject you, do you think?

01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:59.300
Well, it didn't happen to me.

01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:01.300
It happened to Rob Schrober.

01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:05.300
But that was like 65 years ago.

01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:07.300
60 years ago.

01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:09.300
It was longer than that.

01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:15.300
Let's go to the bar, right?

01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:17.300
We're at the bar.

01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:19.300
Yep, that happens.

01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.300
You roll into Hank's last stand

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:23.300
as the Uber drone drives off.

01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:25.300
You recognize some familiar faces.

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:29.300
You see Hank and Teddy,

01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:31.300
and also Hack Eye.

01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:33.300
They're all just chilling.

01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:35.300
Hank? Teddy?

01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:37.300
Hack Eye?

01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:39.300
Hey, how'd it go?

01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:43.300
Waiting for the third one to answer.

01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:47.300
What?

01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.300
What?

01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:53.300
Only one person has been talking.

01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:57.300
Oh, where's Hank and Teddy?

01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:59.300
Hey guys, hey, what's up, I'm Hank.

01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:03.300
Sorry, I was in the bathroom.

01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:07.300
Teddy?

01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:09.300
Hack Eye?

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.300
Where's Hank?

01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:13.300
He's right there.

01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:15.300
Right here.

01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.300
Right here.

01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.300
How come you guys took so long to sit down?

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:23.300
I was over there, jeep bucks,

01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:25.300
trying to pick a song

01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:27.300
that applied to my life,

01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:29.300
but I couldn't find one.

01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:31.300
Nightblade, tell them.

01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:33.300
Tell them what happened.

01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:35.300
Well, the music industry's taking a hit.

01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:41.300
Because of all the increased technology,

01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:43.300
it's anybody who plays a power chord

01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:45.300
to get a record deal now,

01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:47.300
so there's a lot of more popular songs

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:49.300
that tickle that toe-tapping bone

01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:51.300
at a wedding or funeral,

01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:53.300
but by and large,

01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:55.300
no one makes the connection that

01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:57.300
the Beatles used to.

01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:59.300
Amen, amen to that.

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.300
My grandparents listen to the Beatles.

01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:03.300
Oh, shit, yeah, the Beatles.

01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:09.300
My grandparents' parents listen to the Beatles

01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:11.300
and they tell me all about it anyway.

01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:13.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:15.300
Well, anyways, yeah, we went to drop off

01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:17.300
the job and we got

01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:19.300
ghoul-magneted

01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:21.300
by the Johnson.

01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:23.300
It's not worth going into detail.

01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:25.300
We got fucked over on the job.

01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:27.300
We're starting to think where I am, rather.

01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:29.300
I won't pretend that my...

01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.300
I'm gonna take a shit.

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.300
Hey, that's good.

01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:37.300
Won't pretend that my

01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:39.300
viewpoint is shit.

01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:41.300
I'll watch her take a shit.

01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.300
Go for it all.

01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:45.300
Free country.

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.300
I'll keep the door open.

01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:49.300
There's no music,

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:51.300
so we gotta keep ourselves entertained by something.

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:55.300
Can we change the station on the TV

01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:57.300
while I...

01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:59.300
It'll help this go faster.

01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:05.300
The job went poorly.

01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:07.300
So, no, with the changing of the...

01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.300
No?

01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:11.300
I'm not in the bathroom.

01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:13.300
I'm yelling.

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:15.300
What would you say if I had a job?

01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:17.300
You don't have to shit so fast.

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:19.300
Okay.

01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:21.300
What is this girl's...

01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:23.300
What would she do with her legs crossed?

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:25.300
I've seen it all before.

01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:27.300
What would you say...

01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:29.300
What would you say if I had a job for you?

01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:31.300
A job? What?

01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:33.300
A job.

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:35.300
I want a job.

01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:37.300
Yeah.

01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.300
What job?

01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:41.300
Close the door while you're shitting.

01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:43.300
Let's see. Jesus Christ.

01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:45.300
Get in.

01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:47.300
Cool. Yeah, I'm down.

01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:49.300
We all go into the...

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:51.300
We all go into the bathroom with Mercy while she's taking a shit.

01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:53.300
Jesus Christ, I can't believe...

01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:55.300
Go watch her.

01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:57.300
She crosses her legs with shit.

01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:59.300
Let's talk in private.

01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:01.300
She crosses her legs so you can look in.

01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:03.300
It's gross.

01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:05.300
I didn't even know girls took shit.

01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:07.300
They do?

01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:09.300
Look, I have a job.

01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.300
We should go out of the bathroom.

01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.300
God damn it.

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.300
I'm done.

01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:17.300
Okay.

01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:19.300
It wasn't even a fulfilling shit.

01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:21.300
It was almost like too little...

01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:23.300
thing.

01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:25.300
What's the job? What do you have for us?

01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:27.300
I need you guys to break into a storage facility.

01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:29.300
Is that true?

01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:31.300
We have a bunch of MP3s in there.

01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:33.300
What? Oh, no, wait, I can't.

01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:35.300
No, go for it.

01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:37.300
What's the job?

01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:39.300
Wait, where's this going?

01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:41.300
It's probably...

01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:43.300
Let's do it.

01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:45.300
I have a storage facility.

01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:47.300
Full of MP3s.

01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:49.300
With the good stuff.

01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:51.300
Full of MP3s?

01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:53.300
MP3s. Beatles.

01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.300
Stones. Cyrus.

01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:57.300
I got them all.

01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:59.300
Whiskalifa.

01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:01.300
All of it in there.

01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:03.300
Whiskalifa is my favorite.

01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:05.300
You didn't need to rent a storage facility.

01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:07.300
I didn't rent it.

01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:09.300
I just know there's a place where all the MP3s are held.

01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:11.300
Old music. Good music.

01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:13.300
He's Dr. Friend, right?

01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:15.300
No, that's Hank.

01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:17.300
Is it true what they say?

01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:19.300
That all the pops and whistles on those old MP3s

01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:21.300
make the sound somehow better than...

01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:23.300
Oh, those ones and zeros.

01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:25.300
It's so smooth

01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:27.300
I wouldn't even think they played instruments.

01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.300
Oh, my God.

01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:31.300
I mean, I grew up on that.

01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:33.300
When I was fleeing the government

01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:35.300
and I was living in the hills with the Native Americans,

01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:37.300
we used to play MP3s.

01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:39.300
That's the stuff I grew up on.

01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:41.300
People used to have players in the size of their hands.

01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:43.300
I know.

01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:45.300
That's almost 80 years ago.

01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:47.300
I would do anything to get my hands on those.

01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:49.300
More importantly...

01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:51.300
Oh, sorry.

01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:53.300
You go ahead, no.

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:55.300
You guys got them for me. I'd be very excited about that.

01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:57.300
No, go ahead.

01:42:57.300 --> 01:42:59.300
I just want to listen to some music.

01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:01.300
No, you get the job.

01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:03.300
Well, I'm just saying that.

01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:05.300
I remember back then when those players were so big

01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:07.300
you could put one in a paper cup.

01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:09.300
Oh, yeah, I know. Just amplify the sound like a little portable speaker.

01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:11.300
Go ahead. Sorry.

01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:13.300
Nothing more to say than just saying,

01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:15.300
I'd love to listen to some good old classic music

01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:17.300
and say this pop culture junk in here.

01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:19.300
But more importantly, so is the customer.

01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:21.300
Talking big money.

01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:23.300
We'll bring people back to Hank's bar.

01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.300
Finally.

01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:27.300
He's Hank, right?

01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:29.300
Yeah, he's Hank.

01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:31.300
I talk about it in the third person.

01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:33.300
Hey!

01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:35.300
What's up?

01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:37.300
Each one of those MP3s

01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:39.300
is like 99 cents, man.

01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:41.300
That's a lot of money.

01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:43.300
There's more than like three of them.

01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:45.300
More like $1.29 in the later days.

01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:47.300
Shit.

01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:49.300
Hey, hey, hey.

01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:51.300
Hey, hey, hey.

01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:53.300
Hank, Hank,

01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.300
why has it been so long

01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:57.300
since we've seen MP3s

01:43:57.300 --> 01:43:59.300
all this great old music for so long

01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:01.300
and nobody's had access to all this great stuff?

01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:03.300
Music causes revolution.

01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:05.300
Good music.

01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:07.300
They have to take away our music.

01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:09.300
Leave us with this candy coated bullshit.

01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:11.300
Oh my god, you're right.

01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:13.300
Guys, Shadowrunners,

01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:15.300
if we get our hands, do we have a nickname?

01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:17.300
Do we have a team name? I like Shadowrunners.

01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:19.300
I mean, we have to vote,

01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:21.300
but it'll take a while.

01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:23.300
Look, I meet Libertine

01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:25.300
because I named myself after

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:27.300
a punk band from the 70s

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:29.300
from Crass.

01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:31.300
I feel like he's right. Hank is right.

01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:33.300
If we get our hands on this music,

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.300
there's a chance that we can take this old music

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:37.300
and bring humanity back to where it used to be.

01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:39.300
What was the band? It was called Crass.

01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:41.300
Cool.

01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:43.300
You ever heard of it?

01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:45.300
I did now.

01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:47.300
Keep going.

01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:49.300
I don't care what it takes. It all costs.

01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:51.300
I want to get my hands on this music

01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:53.300
and I want to make sure that everybody gets to hear this

01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:55.300
because that's the stuff that might change people's minds

01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:57.300
and bring us back to the humans that we used to be.

01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:59.300
Amen.

01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:01.300
Thank you, Hank.

01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:03.300
Well, did you flush that shit that you took?

01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:05.300
No, I better go back. You want to come with?

01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:07.300
Yeah, come with me.

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:09.300
We go back.

01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:11.300
Both of us go back.

01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:13.300
Sound effects, sound effects. Both of us go back

01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:15.300
to the bathroom.

01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:17.300
And then Dr. Friend uses his detox on you

01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:19.300
which allows you to eliminate all the side effects

01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:21.300
of that terrible meat poison.

01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.300
Oh, boy.

01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:25.300
Look at that. Look at that massive shit.

01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:27.300
It's like using a squatty pot.

01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:29.300
Yes. You could kind of like

01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:31.300
see what my day was.

01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.300
Like just in the relief of...

01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:39.300
Okay, everybody checking this out?

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:41.300
Okay, I'm going to flush it.

01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:43.300
Hey, so Hank...

01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:45.300
Goodbye.

01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:47.300
Goodbye.

01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:49.300
Goodbye, ladies shit.

01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:51.300
Hank, where are these MP3s?

01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:53.300
Allagazza's data map.

01:45:57.300 --> 01:45:59.300
Hortegaard.

01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:01.300
Give Hortegaard the data map.

01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:03.300
Here's the data map.

01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.300
Thank you very much for giving it to me.

01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:07.300
Yeah.

01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:09.300
Yes, thank you.

01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:11.300
I would also like

01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:13.300
to say that

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:15.300
Shadowrunners

01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:17.300
sounds to me more like a racist

01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:19.300
Disney movie.

01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:23.300
I am not so sure about the name

01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:25.300
Shadowrunners as a nickname

01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:27.300
for the group.

01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:29.300
It's not shat. It's shadow.

01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.300
I understood what you said.

01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:33.300
I still...

01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:35.300
Wait a second.

01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:37.300
There's one thing I got to tell you.

01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:39.300
I hope one of you has musical ability

01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:41.300
because to break into this facility

01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:43.300
they don't have key codes.

01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:45.300
Oh, Mercy.

01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:47.300
Mercy has musical ability, I think, right?

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:51.300
Spencer, am I right?

01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:53.300
They don't have key codes.

01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:55.300
They have music codes.

01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:57.300
You have to play music.

01:46:57.300 --> 01:46:59.300
And it's not one thing.

01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:01.300
It's another with these codes, man.

01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:03.300
They couldn't come up with a better name

01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:05.300
for it than music codes.

01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:07.300
I mean, I just heard about it.

01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:09.300
I heard about it as music codes.

01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:11.300
Music codes.

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:13.300
So give us a location

01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:15.300
and we'll take care of the rest.

01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:17.300
Well, I gave you the data map and now I told you a little secret.

01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:19.300
I have the data map.

01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:21.300
All right.

01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:23.300
Well, let's get going. Come on, huh?

01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:25.300
Let's get on my...

01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:27.300
Somebody Uber...

01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:29.300
I call an Uber.

01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:31.300
That's all right.

01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:33.300
Look at the size of that building.

01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:35.300
Pfft.

01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:39.300
You find your...

01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:41.300
You find yourself

01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:43.300
outside of a large building.

01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:45.300
Yeah.

01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:47.300
It's not related...

01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:49.300
It's not related to the storage facility.

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:53.300
Oh, did I punch... did you punch in the wrong address?

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:55.300
I thought you had the address.

01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:57.300
Shit.

01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:59.300
Let's look at the data map.

01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:01.300
Wait a second, guys. This is me, Dr. Friend.

01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:03.300
Where were you?

01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:05.300
I was watching that whole scene at Hank's Bar.

01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:07.300
I thought this was a cool mission and I just kind of

01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:09.300
to sit back and just let you guys handle it.

01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:11.300
It didn't feel like there was any reason for me to interject.

01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:13.300
This pervert's name, Hank,

01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:15.300
gave us a detail.

01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:17.300
I saw the whole thing. I was right there.

01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:19.300
I watched the shit. I watched the more

01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:21.300
massive shit I heard about the thing.

01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:23.300
You never said anything when...

01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:25.300
Why do I... I mean, you know

01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:27.300
part of my character is just keeping it cool.

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.300
Pitching in when I got something.

01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:31.300
I'll speak to speak.

01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:33.300
Spencer, we got the right address right to the...

01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:35.300
Well, no.

01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:37.300
I actually plugged it in.

01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:39.300
This is a musical academy.

01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:41.300
Kind of like a school of rock.

01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:43.300
I think we need to practice.

01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:45.300
So we're going to learn music first

01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:47.300
to learn the musical codes?

01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:49.300
Look, I told you.

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.300
I didn't speak up there because I figured you guys

01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:53.300
would all be on board with this.

01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:55.300
Dr. Friend, that's a good idea.

01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:57.300
We can't go into that building without

01:48:57.300 --> 01:48:59.300
knowing the music.

01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:01.300
We can learn how to do music together.

01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:03.300
We could try.

01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:05.300
We could try.

01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:07.300
I walk

01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:09.300
manfully,

01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:11.300
womanfully through the front doors

01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:13.300
of the musical academy building.

01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:15.300
You do that.

01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:17.300
You find several small children

01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:19.300
staring at you creepily.

01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:21.300
Throw mashed potatoes at them.

01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:23.300
LAUGHTER

01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:25.300
Don't worry, kids.

01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:27.300
That's a callback.

01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:29.300
It's what they call a callback.

01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:31.300
Hey, kids.

01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:33.300
I'm entering, too.

01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:35.300
Hey, kids, I heard you could teach us how to sing.

01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:37.300
That might be true.

01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:39.300
We need to learn how to perform.

01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:41.300
Kids, how old are you all?

01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:43.300
Seven.

01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:45.300
We're bad chatter runners.

01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:47.300
We mostly just...

01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:49.300
Speak for yourself.

01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:51.300
Speak for yourself.

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:53.300
I think it's time for us to admit

01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:55.300
that maybe kids could teach us how to

01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:57.300
work in harmony

01:49:57.300 --> 01:49:59.300
together.

01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:01.300
So, kids, maybe you...

01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:03.300
Your groans are misplaced.

01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:05.300
LAUGHTER

01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:07.300
I'm on their side.

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:09.300
I feel like we need these children

01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:11.300
to teach us.

01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:13.300
I, for one, if we want

01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:15.300
these MP3s to

01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:17.300
reunite humanity through music

01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:19.300
for the good old days.

01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:21.300
Thank you.

01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:23.300
Kids, where do we

01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:25.300
start our education?

01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:27.300
We should probably show them what we got.

01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:29.300
Yeah.

01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:31.300
APPLAUSE

01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:33.300
And then let them adjust us.

01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:35.300
Yeah.

01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:37.300
Because you never know.

01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:39.300
Maybe we could have read the first time.

And that's what we got.

01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:33.300
That was great.

01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:37.300
APPLAUSE

01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:39.300
What did the kids think?

01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:41.300
Is that good kids?

01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:43.300
We'll find out next time.

01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:45.300
We'll hear the kids' reaction when we do.

01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:03.300
I know that may seem daunting to you

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:05.300
but it's actually super easy.

01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:07.300
I do it all the time.

01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:09.300

01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:37.300
