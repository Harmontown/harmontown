{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:22.400\nYou guys got the rhythm.\n\n00:22.400 --> 00:29.440\nWelcome once again to Meltdown Commons in Hollywood, California.\n\n00:29.440 --> 00:31.440\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:31.440 --> 00:45.440\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:45.440 --> 00:48.440\nAlright, let's get this over with.\n\n00:48.440 --> 00:58.440\nI've been Minecrafting for two days and I'm in the middle of a big skyscraper and I'm trying to get my item ducts working.\n\n00:58.440 --> 01:02.440\nWhat were you talking about last night, chicken chuggers?\n\n01:02.440 --> 01:14.440\nSpencer was recommending, because in Minecraft, the world is infinitely procedurally generated as you go anywhere and everything that is created stays where it is.\n\n01:14.440 --> 01:26.440\nHowever, things don't stay active, like if you're cooking something in a little grill and you walk too far away from it, it'll just kind of stop cooking on the grill.\n\n01:26.440 --> 01:33.440\nBut the grill will still be there and the thing will still be on the grill unless you build what's called a chunk loader.\n\n01:33.440 --> 01:40.440\nBecause everything's in chunks, the data is all in chunks, so Spencer was recommending a thing called chicken chunks.\n\n01:40.440 --> 01:46.440\nAlright, this is the most ill-advised way to open a show.\n\n01:46.440 --> 01:48.440\nShould I start playing this game? Is it that good?\n\n01:48.440 --> 01:50.440\nOh god, it's the best.\n\n01:50.440 --> 01:52.440\nMy applause, who plays this game here?\n\n01:52.440 --> 01:58.440\nIt's not even a game, it's like knitting, you know?\n\n01:58.440 --> 02:05.440\nRemember when we both had pirated copies of Maya and we would just send little things back and forth?\n\n02:05.440 --> 02:18.440\nYou would make a sphere with some nipples on it and then you'd email me the file and then I'd open it up and I'd extrude the nipples and loft them into a nerve surface.\n\n02:18.440 --> 02:26.440\nNo, it's fun, it's like a hobby, it's not really a game because there's no score and you're not trying to kill anybody.\n\n02:26.440 --> 02:29.440\nIt's like playing LEGO.\n\n02:29.440 --> 02:32.440\nSo the sense of achievement is from moment to moment?\n\n02:32.440 --> 02:34.440\nYeah, it's just making stuff.\n\n02:34.440 --> 02:41.440\nYou get a multiplayer server and then you can go, you just sit there by yourself most of the time forever even if your friend's on there.\n\n02:41.440 --> 02:49.440\nBut then sometimes you maybe jet pack over to your friend's location and look at what they're making.\n\n02:49.440 --> 02:55.440\nMaybe I'll take up knitting, that'd be alright.\n\n02:55.440 --> 02:58.440\nMake a hat, that'd be great.\n\n02:58.440 --> 03:01.440\nI'm really sorry about the beginning of this episode.\n\n03:01.440 --> 03:03.440\nI didn't mean for it to happen this way.\n\n03:03.440 --> 03:11.440\nI got picked up for an Uber tonight and I don't know why, I can't penetrate the Lyft membrane, I don't know why.\n\n03:11.440 --> 03:19.440\nI've had nothing good experiences with Lyft but I keep going back to Uber like an abused boyfriend.\n\n03:19.440 --> 03:32.440\nLike Abe Lincoln crawling back to Mary Todd, no matter how hard she hits him.\n\n03:32.440 --> 03:34.440\nWasn't there some rumor about this?\n\n03:34.440 --> 03:36.440\nShe was so crazy she beat Abe?\n\n03:36.440 --> 03:39.440\nYeah, wasn't there some rumor about that Abe Lincoln was a battered husband?\n\n03:39.440 --> 03:40.440\nWhat?\n\n03:40.440 --> 03:42.440\nI can't be just making that up.\n\n03:42.440 --> 03:44.440\nI mean, I can be.\n\n03:44.440 --> 03:47.440\nI wish you had that deep of an imagination.\n\n03:47.440 --> 03:49.440\nYeah, exactly, me too.\n\n03:49.440 --> 03:51.440\nI feel like I heard that somewhere.\n\n03:51.440 --> 03:54.440\nOkay, well we're gonna find out tomorrow online.\n\n03:54.440 --> 03:59.440\nSo I got into the Uber and new thing.\n\n03:59.440 --> 04:08.440\nThe guy, I get into the Uber and the guy has a paper and pencil, a piece of typing paper and a pencil.\n\n04:08.440 --> 04:16.440\nAnd he says, in the Uber app, as you know, you type in your address where you want to get picked up and then you type,\n\n04:16.440 --> 04:18.440\nnow you can type in your destination.\n\n04:18.440 --> 04:22.440\nSo you would think a little less talking maybe, a little less maintenance.\n\n04:22.440 --> 04:27.440\nI get into the car and the guy says, where are you going?\n\n04:27.440 --> 04:29.440\nAnd this happens a lot.\n\n04:29.440 --> 04:34.440\nI don't know how to sound like an asshole, but I just went like, isn't it on the thing?\n\n04:34.440 --> 04:36.440\nLike look at the thing, because I can see it.\n\n04:36.440 --> 04:37.440\nIt's on the armrest.\n\n04:37.440 --> 04:45.440\nThere's like a map on his phone, a blinking, like a hologram of me saying, where are you driving me?\n\n04:45.440 --> 04:47.440\nBut he's got the pen and paper out.\n\n04:47.440 --> 04:50.440\nAnd he goes like, what's the street?\n\n04:50.440 --> 04:53.440\nAnd I said, wait, look at the thing.\n\n04:53.440 --> 04:55.440\nIt's on sunset.\n\n04:55.440 --> 04:58.440\nDan, was this guy Asian?\n\n04:58.440 --> 05:02.440\nNo, I'm joking.\n\n05:02.440 --> 05:05.440\nI just realized, he was talking about my street.\n\n05:05.440 --> 05:07.440\nHe was talking about the street I live on.\n\n05:07.440 --> 05:14.440\nAnd he wanted to know how to spell it, because he wanted to write it down on a piece of typing paper with a pencil to murder his leg.\n\n05:14.440 --> 05:25.440\nLike a weird, emotionally challenged junior in high school who was trying to get his homework done on the bus.\n\n05:25.440 --> 05:30.440\nHe's just like scribbling, scrawling the name of my street down?\n\n05:30.440 --> 05:33.440\nIs it keeping a cooked book or something?\n\n05:33.440 --> 05:34.440\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n05:34.440 --> 05:39.440\nNow I told you what street I live on, so I'm sorry I paused in the middle of that.\n\n05:39.440 --> 05:41.440\nIt's a long street.\n\n05:41.440 --> 05:45.440\nIt's at least six houses long.\n\n05:45.440 --> 05:50.440\nYou'll never find the gate with H on it.\n\n05:50.440 --> 05:53.440\nJust look for the Uber car in front of the guy's name.\n\n05:53.440 --> 05:56.440\nJust look for the line of Uber cars.\n\n05:56.440 --> 05:59.440\nYou gotta do lifts, man. The lift is way more fun.\n\n05:59.440 --> 06:01.440\nIt's faster and easier for my entertainment dollar.\n\n06:01.440 --> 06:05.440\nWell, now it doesn't matter. I'm going to be murdered by Monday.\n\n06:05.440 --> 06:08.440\nThree people who will only be doing things with the best intentions.\n\n06:08.440 --> 06:11.440\nYou took a couple lifts, though, right? Or just one?\n\n06:11.440 --> 06:13.440\nI took two lifts.\n\n06:13.440 --> 06:15.440\nI had a good time in both.\n\n06:15.440 --> 06:19.440\nI mean, it's the front seat thing.\n\n06:19.440 --> 06:20.440\nYou don't have to sit in the front.\n\n06:20.440 --> 06:22.440\nI know, but then you're weird.\n\n06:22.440 --> 06:24.440\nIn a lift, you get in the back seat, you're weird.\n\n06:24.440 --> 06:29.440\nI accidentally sat in the back. Sometimes I sat in the front of an Uber. Nobody seems to care.\n\n06:29.440 --> 06:35.440\nUber is just a bummer. I don't know. It's slow and funky, and I don't like it.\n\n06:35.440 --> 06:39.440\nHygiene Corner!\n\n06:39.440 --> 06:45.440\nI'm gonna find a good song for it, because it's Hygiene Corner.\n\n06:49.440 --> 06:50.440\nIt's a lot like sports corner.\n\n06:50.440 --> 06:54.440\nIt's when you clean yourself.

just stay out of trouble?\n\n31:15.440 --> 31:17.440\nI think so, because they had this cool\n\n31:17.440 --> 31:19.440\nSwiss downy Robinson deal.\n\n31:19.440 --> 31:21.440\nI think you're a sitting

harkabuses?\n\n31:33.440 --> 31:35.440\nYeah, what is that?\n\n31:35.440 --> 31:37.440\nIt's another matchlocked guy that's long.\n\n31:37.440 --> 31:39.440\nIt's like a precursor, I believe, to a blunderbuse.\n\n31:39.440 --> 31:41.440\nIt's like a longer rifle.\n\n31:41.440 --> 31:43.440\nIt's pretty nuts, you tell ya.\n\n31:43.440 --> 31:45.440\nThe old ones.\n\n31:45.440 --> 31:47.440\nIt looks like you're on the ride.\n\n31:47.440 --> 31:49.440\nIt's amazing.\n\n31:49.440 --> 31:51.440\nEverything looks like a set.\n\n31:51.440 --> 31:53.440\nIt's beautiful.\n\n31:53.440 --> 31:55.440\nYou don't ever shiver my timbers?\n\n31:55.440 --> 31:57.440\nThat's from...\n\n31:57.440 --> 31:59.440\nGod, are you in the bounty?\n\n31:59.440 --> 32:01.440\nNow you have to

don't know for sure.\n\n32:09.440 --> 32:11.440\nWhere would you think\n\n32:11.440 --> 32:13.440\nreal Abed\n\n32:13.440 --> 32:15.440\nthat's different from Timbers?\n\n32:15.440 --> 32:17.440\nI would say it would have to be\n\n32:17.440 --> 32:19.440\nan old Pirate movie,\n\n32:19.440 --> 32:21.440\nbut it might be a Pirate series.\n\n32:21.440 --> 32:23.440\nI'm going to go with Pirate movie.\n\n32:23.440 --> 32:25.440\nMaybe it's Captain\n\n32:25.440 --> 32:27.440\nCourageous or something?\n\n32:27.440 --> 32:29.440\nCaptain's Courageous?\n\n32:29.440 --> 32:31.440\nI believe it actually comes from actual\n\n32:31.440 --> 32:33.440\nPirate terminology.\n\n32:33.440 --> 32:35.440\nI assume it's just your boat's made out of wood,\n\n32:35.440 --> 32:37.440\nand if it's shivering,\n\n32:37.440 --> 32:39.440\nit's really scary out.\n\n32:39.440 --> 32:41.440\nThe foremost way\n\n32:41.440 --> 32:43.440\nof knowing that you're in deep shit\n\n32:43.440 --> 32:45.440\nis that your timbers are shaken.\n\n32:45.440 --> 32:47.440\nYour boat's like creaking.\n\n32:47.440 --> 32:49.440\nFrom what I read,\n\n32:49.440 --> 32:51.440\none of the most common injuries\n\n32:51.440 --> 32:53.440\nwhen you got hit by a broadside cannonball,\n\n32:53.440 --> 32:55.440\nit wasn't the cannonball that was likely to hit you.\n\n32:55.440 --> 32:57.440\nIt was going to hit the wood,\n\n32:57.440 --> 32:59.440\nand you would get hit by splinters,\n\n32:59.440 --> 33:01.440\nand they called those shivers.\n\n33:01.440 --> 33:03.440\nSo you died by getting Schrab.eled with wood.\n\n33:03.440 --> 33:05.440\nIf it didn't kill you outright,\n\n33:05.440 --> 33:07.440\nyou'd get infected eventually\n\n33:07.440 --> 33:09.440\nbecause you just had gross rotting shipwood\n\n33:09.440 --> 33:11.440\nstuck in your body.\n\n33:11.440 --> 33:13.440\nShipwood, huh?\n\n33:13.440 --> 33:15.440\nI thought it's just the guy's balls,\n\n33:15.440 --> 33:17.440\nand he's like pulled,\n\n33:17.440 --> 33:19.440\nand he's like, oh, my timbers are shivering.\n\n33:19.440 --> 33:21.440\nThat's what I thought.\n\n33:21.440 --> 33:23.440\nIt's something funny like that.\n\n33:23.440 --> 33:25.440\nHe leaps into this dark,\n\n33:25.440 --> 33:27.440\nlike splinters attacking you\n\n33:27.440 --> 33:29.440\nlike a crazy Hellraiser movie.\n\n33:29.440 --> 33:31.440\nWhat's with that guy?\n\n33:31.440 --> 33:33.440\nWhat is he crazy?\n\n33:33.440 --> 33:35.440\nSo you and Spencer have been hanging out?\n\n33:35.440 --> 33:37.440\nWell, you know, it's funny that you say this\n\n33:37.440 --> 33:39.440\nbecause, like...\n\n33:39.440 --> 33:41.440\nIt's odd that he says that.\n\n33:41.440 --> 33:43.440\nIs that better?\n\n33:43.440 --> 33:45.440\nIt's the premise.\n\n33:45.440 --> 33:47.440\nIt's strange that you would bring that up\n\n33:47.440 --> 33:49.440\nbecause it's the topic of the conversation\n\n33:49.440 --> 33:51.440\nthat just started.\n\n33:51.440 --> 33:53.440\nIt's a crazy that you bring up.\n\n33:53.440 --> 33:55.440\nInteresting enough.\n\n33:55.440 --> 33:57.440\nI don't know, but see,\n\n33:57.440 --> 33:59.440\nI've been with his friend from the get-go\n\n33:59.440 --> 34:01.440\nfrom the first time I hung out\n\n34:01.440 --> 34:03.440\nwith him here a couple of times.\n\n34:03.440 --> 34:05.440\nFrom Jump Street.\n\n34:05.440 --> 34:07.440\nI would be at that crazy karaoke place,\n\n34:07.440 --> 34:09.440\nand for some reason,\n\n34:09.440 --> 34:11.440\nme and him always just clicked.\n\n34:11.440 --> 34:13.440\nI would just make jokes, and then he would laugh.\n\n34:13.440 --> 34:15.440\nAnd then we'd just hang out,\n\n34:15.440 --> 34:17.440\nand I found out this guy likes muffins.\n\n34:17.440 --> 34:19.440\nHe likes Magic the Gathering.\n\n34:19.440 --> 34:21.440\nWe find that we have stuff in common.\n\n34:21.440 --> 34:23.440\nThis is kind of weird to me because\n\n34:23.440 --> 34:25.440\nSpencer's not a big laugher,\n\n34:25.440 --> 34:27.440\nand you're not...\n\n34:27.440 --> 34:29.440\nAnd he hates muffins.\n\n34:29.440 --> 34:31.440\nYeah, they would feel like,\n\n34:31.440 --> 34:33.440\nhow do I get the map away from here?\n\n34:33.440 --> 34:35.440\nWell, their laughter limits\n\n34:35.440 --> 34:37.440\nwould be tested.\n\n34:37.440 --> 34:39.440\nI take people to laughter limits.\n\n34:39.440 --> 34:41.440\nI find it very easy to be dry\n\n34:41.440 --> 34:43.440\nwhen I'm listening to you make jokes.\n\n34:43.440 --> 34:45.440\nI'm not tempted to, like, guffaw.\n\n34:45.440 --> 34:47.440\nEvery relationship I have\n\n34:47.440 --> 34:49.440\nin that sense is like,\n\n34:49.440 -->

second thing?\n\n49:29.440 --> 49:31.440\nWas that worse than the second thing?\n\n49:31.440 --> 49:33.440\nYeah, I think that is worse,\n\n49:33.440 --> 49:35.440\njust because when I was doing it,\n\n49:35.440 --> 49:37.440\nI was feeling so guilty.\n\n49:37.440 --> 49:39.440\nThe worst thing is when he peed in his brother's pee.\n\n49:39.440 --> 49:41.440\nBecause his brother loves to drink his own pee.\n\n49:41.440 --> 49:43.440\nIt's one thing\n\n49:43.440 --> 49:45.440\nto spike country time lemonade, but...\n\n49:45.440 --> 49:47.440\nYeah.\n\n49:47.440 --> 49:49.440\nThey're gonna know.\n\n49:49.440 --> 49:51.440\nAlright, sorry, go ahead.\n\n49:51.440 --> 49:53.440\nBut this is the one that\n\n49:53.440 --> 49:55.440\ncame to me later in life,\n\n49:55.440 --> 49:57.440\nwhich deservingly so, I couldn't get mad.\n\n49:57.440 --> 49:59.440\nBecause I was like, well, I did do that to somebody.\n\n49:59.440 --> 50:01.440\nAnd anyway,\n\n50:01.440 --> 50:03.440\nI did this to my brother.\n\n50:03.440 --> 50:05.440\nI took, like, cayenne pepper\n\n50:05.440 --> 50:07.440\nand I put it in water\n\n50:07.440 --> 50:09.440\nand then I put it in a super-soaker.\n\n50:09.440 --> 50:11.440\nAnd then I went up to him and squirted his eyes.\n\n50:11.440 --> 50:13.440\nAnd like...\n\n50:13.440 --> 50:15.440\nI think that's worse.\n\n50:15.440 --> 50:17.440\nYeah, that's pretty bad, I know.\n\n50:17.440 --> 50:19.440\nAnd he was like screaming.\n\n50:19.440 --> 50:21.440\nI think that's called aggravated assault.\n\n50:21.440 --> 50:23.440\nIt was so evil and rotten.\n\n50:23.440 --> 50:25.440\nAnd I remember my mom being like,\n\n50:25.440 --> 50:27.440\nwho are you?\n\n50:27.440 --> 50:29.440\nWho does that?\n\n50:29.440 --> 50:31.440\nAre you like a Bond supervillain?\n\n50:31.440 --> 50:33.440\nYou know, like, that's not like you.\n\n50:33.440 --> 50:35.440\nYou're not evil, you're not manipulative\n\n50:35.440 --> 50:37.440\nand crazy.\n\n50:37.440 --> 50:39.440\nAnd I'm like, I don't know.\n\n50:39.440 --> 50:41.440\nI mean, sometimes you get mad.\n\n50:41.440 --> 50:43.440\nYou just gotta strike out.\n\n50:43.440 --> 50:45.440\nAnd then what happened was later in life\n\n50:45.440 --> 50:47.440\nI was hanging out with Justin.\n\n50:47.440 --> 50:49.440\nAnd I fell asleep at his house.\n\n50:49.440 --> 50:51.440\nAnd of course, when you hang out with Justin\n\n50:51.440 --> 50:53.440\nand he's like, woo-hoo!\n\n50:53.440 --> 50:55.440\nIn one of his moods, he doesn't want you to fall asleep.\n\n50:55.440 --> 50:57.440\nHe needs a partner in crime.\n\n50:57.440 --> 50:59.440\nSo he got so mad that I fell asleep\n\n50:59.440 --> 51:01.440\nthat he wakes me up and then he just dumps\n\n51:01.440 --> 51:03.440\nlike water with cayenne pepper in my eyes.\n\n51:03.440 --> 51:05.440\nYou know, like, just like,\n\n51:05.440 --> 51:07.440\nwake up, wake up!\n\n51:07.440 --> 51:09.440\nAnd then like...\n\n51:09.440 --> 51:11.440\nDid he do that because he knows that you had done that in the past?\n\n51:11.440 --> 51:13.440\nNo, no, no. I think I told him later.\n\n51:13.440 --> 51:15.440\nReally? Yeah, because I said like, I was like,\n\n51:15.440 --> 51:17.440\nyou know, I didn't really get that mad\n\n51:17.440 --> 51:19.440\nand he was like, he was like, oh, no shit.\n\n51:19.440 --> 51:21.440\nAnd then I told him the story.\n\n51:21.440 --> 51:23.440\nAnd anyway, but what's crazy is like,\n\n51:23.440 --> 51:25.440\nI just remember, like, I think I was in a dream\n\n51:25.440 --> 51:27.440\nand then I just woke up\n\n51:27.440 --> 51:29.440\nto like instant pain and blindness.\n\n51:29.440 --> 51:31.440\nIf you dump cayenne pepper water\n\n51:31.440 --> 51:33.440\non somebody while they're sleeping, you better be\n\n51:33.440 --> 51:35.440\ncertain they're not going to murder you afterwards.\n\n51:35.440 --> 51:37.440\nNo, I was like, I felt it was a nightmare\n\n51:37.440 --> 51:39.440\nbecause I was in so much pain, but I was like,\n\n51:39.440 --> 51:41.440\nwhat's happening?

first episode is like\n\n01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.440\nhis best friend from my childhood.\n\n01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.440\nStill, like he said, was raised\n\n01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.440\nthinking the South really happened.\n\n01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.440\nSouth won the war.\n\n01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:41.440\nIt's still happening, baby.\n\n01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.440\nFlag cop is torn between

do?\n\n01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.440\nWhat's the season finale\n\n01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.440\nof flag cop?\n\n01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.440\nWhere he finds out\n\n01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.440\nthat he was brainwashed as a kid\n\n01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.440\nand that he actually does believe in the other flag?\n\n01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.440\nSo he has to like think.\n\n01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.440\nLike everything I've been taught is a lie.\n\n01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.440\nAnd then you're like, next season,\n\n01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.440\nwas it really a lie\n\n01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.440\nor was he tricked into thinking that?\n\n01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.440\nSounds about as good\n\n01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.440\nas most TV these days.\n\n01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.440\nHe didn't give me much to work with.\n\n01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.440\nHe gave me flag cop.\n\n01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.440\nI could see this on Netflix.\n\n01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.440\nCould flag cop be into different flags?\n\n01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.440\nOr is it only about the North and the South?\n\n01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.440\nWell, like in season two,\n\n01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.440\nwe go, well,\n\n01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.440\nthe flag is kind of like cool,\n\n01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.440\nbut I like that design in the Brazil flag.\n\n01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.440\nIt looks like a cool globe.\n\n01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:35.440\nIt's all blue with stars.\n\n01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.440\nAnd so he's like, he falls in love with this Brazilian girl\n\n01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.440\nthat's like, she's really\n\n01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.440\nworking for Brazil to kind of trick him,\n\n01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.440\nbut he doesn't know that.\n\n01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.440\nSo the whole season you think, oh, he just found a girlfriend,\n\n01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.440\nbut like, she's really against him.\n\n01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.440\nAnd in the last episode, we're like,\n\n01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.440\nThat sounds better than most TV.\n\n01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.440\nIt's probably\n\n01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.440\nseason is Confederate versus US flag,\n\n01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.440\nand it's like a really popular show,\n\n01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.440\nreally critically lauded.\n\n01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.440\nAnd then second season, they do like\n\n01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.440\nthe wire doing the stevedores, you know.\n\n01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.440\nHe's right, he's right.\n\n01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.440\nThe wire could be about any kind of wire.\n\n01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.440\nAnd then third season,\n\n01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.440\nthey're like, okay, yeah, but seriously,\n\n01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.440\nhow about those crack dealers?\n\n01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.440\nSo then third season, we go

There's evidence on it.\n\n01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.440\nAnd the whole thing's about untying that knot.\n\n01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.440\nYou're untying the flag the whole season.\n\n01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.440\nDon't let it touch the ground.\n\n01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.440\nYeah, you can't let it touch the ground either.\n\n01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.440\nIt might be an American

make him.\n\n01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.440\nThe reason they come up there,\n\n01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.440\nbecause the flag is going to touch the ground by season.\n\n01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.440\nHe wants the flag to touch the ground?\n\n01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.440\nThe bad guy's lowering it to the ground.\n\n01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.440\nAnd Flag Cop has to keep it from touching the ground.\n\n01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.440\nI don't know what the stakes are.\n\n01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.440\nI just know.\n\n01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.440\nBecause you open the episode
