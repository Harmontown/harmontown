00:00.000 --> 00:22.400
You guys got the rhythm.

00:22.400 --> 00:29.440
Welcome once again to Meltdown Commons in Hollywood, California.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.440
Harmontown is now in session.

00:31.440 --> 00:45.440
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:45.440 --> 00:48.440
Alright, let's get this over with.

00:48.440 --> 00:58.440
I've been Minecrafting for two days and I'm in the middle of a big skyscraper and I'm trying to get my item ducts working.

00:58.440 --> 01:02.440
What were you talking about last night, chicken chuggers?

01:02.440 --> 01:14.440
Spencer was recommending, because in Minecraft, the world is infinitely procedurally generated as you go anywhere and everything that is created stays where it is.

01:14.440 --> 01:26.440
However, things don't stay active, like if you're cooking something in a little grill and you walk too far away from it, it'll just kind of stop cooking on the grill.

01:26.440 --> 01:33.440
But the grill will still be there and the thing will still be on the grill unless you build what's called a chunk loader.

01:33.440 --> 01:40.440
Because everything's in chunks, the data is all in chunks, so Spencer was recommending a thing called chicken chunks.

01:40.440 --> 01:46.440
Alright, this is the most ill-advised way to open a show.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.440
Should I start playing this game? Is it that good?

01:48.440 --> 01:50.440
Oh god, it's the best.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.440
My applause, who plays this game here?

01:52.440 --> 01:58.440
It's not even a game, it's like knitting, you know?

01:58.440 --> 02:05.440
Remember when we both had pirated copies of Maya and we would just send little things back and forth?

02:05.440 --> 02:18.440
You would make a sphere with some nipples on it and then you'd email me the file and then I'd open it up and I'd extrude the nipples and loft them into a nerve surface.

02:18.440 --> 02:26.440
No, it's fun, it's like a hobby, it's not really a game because there's no score and you're not trying to kill anybody.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.440
It's like playing LEGO.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.440
So the sense of achievement is from moment to moment?

02:32.440 --> 02:34.440
Yeah, it's just making stuff.

02:34.440 --> 02:41.440
You get a multiplayer server and then you can go, you just sit there by yourself most of the time forever even if your friend's on there.

02:41.440 --> 02:49.440
But then sometimes you maybe jet pack over to your friend's location and look at what they're making.

02:49.440 --> 02:55.440
Maybe I'll take up knitting, that'd be alright.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.440
Make a hat, that'd be great.

02:58.440 --> 03:01.440
I'm really sorry about the beginning of this episode.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.440
I didn't mean for it to happen this way.

03:03.440 --> 03:11.440
I got picked up for an Uber tonight and I don't know why, I can't penetrate the Lyft membrane, I don't know why.

03:11.440 --> 03:19.440
I've had nothing good experiences with Lyft but I keep going back to Uber like an abused boyfriend.

03:19.440 --> 03:32.440
Like Abe Lincoln crawling back to Mary Todd, no matter how hard she hits him.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.440
Wasn't there some rumor about this?

03:34.440 --> 03:36.440
She was so crazy she beat Abe?

03:36.440 --> 03:39.440
Yeah, wasn't there some rumor about that Abe Lincoln was a battered husband?

03:39.440 --> 03:40.440
What?

03:40.440 --> 03:42.440
I can't be just making that up.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.440
I mean, I can be.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.440
I wish you had that deep of an imagination.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.440
Yeah, exactly, me too.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.440
I feel like I heard that somewhere.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.440
Okay, well we're gonna find out tomorrow online.

03:54.440 --> 03:59.440
So I got into the Uber and new thing.

03:59.440 --> 04:08.440
The guy, I get into the Uber and the guy has a paper and pencil, a piece of typing paper and a pencil.

04:08.440 --> 04:16.440
And he says, in the Uber app, as you know, you type in your address where you want to get picked up and then you type,

04:16.440 --> 04:18.440
now you can type in your destination.

04:18.440 --> 04:22.440
So you would think a little less talking maybe, a little less maintenance.

04:22.440 --> 04:27.440
I get into the car and the guy says, where are you going?

04:27.440 --> 04:29.440
And this happens a lot.

04:29.440 --> 04:34.440
I don't know how to sound like an asshole, but I just went like, isn't it on the thing?

04:34.440 --> 04:36.440
Like look at the thing, because I can see it.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.440
It's on the armrest.

04:37.440 --> 04:45.440
There's like a map on his phone, a blinking, like a hologram of me saying, where are you driving me?

04:45.440 --> 04:47.440
But he's got the pen and paper out.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.440
And he goes like, what's the street?

04:50.440 --> 04:53.440
And I said, wait, look at the thing.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.440
It's on sunset.

04:55.440 --> 04:58.440
Dan, was this guy Asian?

04:58.440 --> 05:02.440
No, I'm joking.

05:02.440 --> 05:05.440
I just realized, he was talking about my street.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.440
He was talking about the street I live on.

05:07.440 --> 05:14.440
And he wanted to know how to spell it, because he wanted to write it down on a piece of typing paper with a pencil to murder his leg.

05:14.440 --> 05:25.440
Like a weird, emotionally challenged junior in high school who was trying to get his homework done on the bus.

05:25.440 --> 05:30.440
He's just like scribbling, scrawling the name of my street down?

05:30.440 --> 05:33.440
Is it keeping a cooked book or something?

05:33.440 --> 05:34.440
It doesn't matter.

05:34.440 --> 05:39.440
Now I told you what street I live on, so I'm sorry I paused in the middle of that.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.440
It's a long street.

05:41.440 --> 05:45.440
It's at least six houses long.

05:45.440 --> 05:50.440
You'll never find the gate with H on it.

05:50.440 --> 05:53.440
Just look for the Uber car in front of the guy's name.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.440
Just look for the line of Uber cars.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.440
You gotta do lifts, man. The lift is way more fun.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.440
It's faster and easier for my entertainment dollar.

06:01.440 --> 06:05.440
Well, now it doesn't matter. I'm going to be murdered by Monday.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.440
Three people who will only be doing things with the best intentions.

06:08.440 --> 06:11.440
You took a couple lifts, though, right? Or just one?

06:11.440 --> 06:13.440
I took two lifts.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.440
I had a good time in both.

06:15.440 --> 06:19.440
I mean, it's the front seat thing.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.440
You don't have to sit in the front.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.440
I know, but then you're weird.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.440
In a lift, you get in the back seat, you're weird.

06:24.440 --> 06:29.440
I accidentally sat in the back. Sometimes I sat in the front of an Uber. Nobody seems to care.

06:29.440 --> 06:35.440
Uber is just a bummer. I don't know. It's slow and funky, and I don't like it.

06:35.440 --> 06:39.440
Hygiene Corner!

06:39.440 --> 06:45.440
I'm gonna find a good song for it, because it's Hygiene Corner.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.440
It's a lot like sports corner.

06:50.440 --> 06:54.440
It's when you clean yourself. Yo, yo, Hygiene Corner.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.440
Calling all scientists, please.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.440
The planet only has so much time left.

07:04.440 --> 07:08.440
We're all dying.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.440
We're not gonna make it to the moon.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.440
The globals are warming.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.440
The tides are rising.

07:17.440 --> 07:21.440
AIDS is airborne.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.440
By the time you hear this recording, maybe it will be.

07:25.440 --> 07:29.440
All I'm saying is, before we die,

07:29.440 --> 07:35.440
could someone just make a pill that makes your fingernails stop growing?

07:35.440 --> 07:39.440
Just make a... how hard can that be?

07:39.440 --> 07:42.440
Has this become a big burden in your life?

07:42.440 --> 07:47.440
Only for 41 years or so, since I was born with these pointless fingernails

07:47.440 --> 07:53.440
that constantly grow, unless you take a medieval appliance

07:53.440 --> 08:03.440
and use pressure and hewing metal to chisel off chunks of lifeless keratin?

08:03.440 --> 08:06.440
What is it, chitin? What the fuck is on us? What is this shit?

08:06.440 --> 08:08.440
Why do we have it?

08:08.440 --> 08:12.440
It's from before punching was invented.

08:12.440 --> 08:16.440
It's like if we generate so you can pick up your keys to land on the ground.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.440
I don't use my nails to pick up my keys.

08:18.440 --> 08:21.440
Your credit card off the bar?

08:21.440 --> 08:23.440
Yeah, you need that.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.440
If they get damaged, they have to regenerate.

08:25.440 --> 08:29.440
A rodent's teeth has to regenerate the dentin to burrow and shit, man.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.440
I guess if we're using them...

08:32.440 --> 08:35.440
You never scratch yourself?

08:35.440 --> 08:37.440
Yeah, you never scratch yourself.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.440
But I just feel like if we didn't have them, then we wouldn't itch as much.

08:41.440 --> 08:45.440
And we'd make keys thicker.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.440
And credit cards with little handles on them.

08:48.440 --> 08:56.440
We don't have a belly button tentacle, but it's not like we notice it's gone all the time.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.440
Because we don't have any devices.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.440
There's not like a rope to get into each building.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.440
It's like, use your belly button tentacle to get in it.

09:03.440 --> 09:07.440
Oh fuck! Let's just get rid of the fucking fingernails.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.440
Or just make them stop growing.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.440
Just make them stop growing.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.440
What if you damaged one?

09:13.440 --> 09:15.440
Then you take the antidote.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.440
For a week and make them grow a little bit.

09:18.440 --> 09:21.440
Do you work for Big Pharma? Is that your thing?

09:21.440 --> 09:23.440
It's a weird drug push right now.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.440
Okay, all right. No pills.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.440
A better device than these clippers.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.440
They're called your back teeth, Jack? I bite my fingernails.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.440
Look at these. Perfect.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.440
I'm a perfect fingernail biter.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.440
Gross.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.440
It's weird what grosses people out.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.440
It doesn't gross other people out.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.440
Biting your toenails is gross, but people do it.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.440
Anyone here bite the toenails?

09:46.440 --> 09:48.440
No one's going to bite.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.440
There's people that do it.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.440
Your brother does?

09:52.440 --> 09:54.440
Have you seen him do it?

09:54.440 --> 09:56.440
That's horrifying.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.440
He has to lift his foot all the way up to his knee.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.440
Is he a yogi?

10:01.440 --> 10:04.440
That's flexible. I couldn't if I wanted to.

10:04.440 --> 10:08.440
I guess it is jealousy.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.440
All right, Jeff.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.440
A bootlegger.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.440
Are we still on Hygiene Corner?

10:14.440 --> 10:16.440
No. Do you want a new segment?

10:16.440 --> 10:18.440
No.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.440
Hygiene.

10:20.440 --> 10:24.440
That was Hygiene Corner.

10:24.440 --> 10:28.440
I just like bookends.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.440
There was a guy that got 33 months in prison.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.440
Somebody tweeted me a link to an article.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.440
I believe this was in the UK.

10:34.440 --> 10:37.440
Some guy recorded Fast the Furious 9, whatever they're on,

10:37.440 --> 10:40.440
in the theater, you know, like they do.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.440
He uploaded it onto the web

10:42.440 --> 10:44.440
and was charging like a pound 50

10:44.440 --> 10:47.440
for torrent downloads of it.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.440
And they caught him and they sentenced him

10:49.440 --> 10:51.440
to 33 months in prison.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.440
You should be sentenced that much

10:53.440 --> 10:56.440
for just going to that movie in the first place.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.440
Zing.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.440
Obviously making an example of this guy.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.440
33 years.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.440
He was already sentenced?

11:04.440 --> 11:06.440
That's the sentence.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.440
He has been sentenced.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.440
33 years.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.440
I heard years.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.440
33 months. That's ridiculous.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.440
It's crazy.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.440
Obviously all it comes down to is money.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.440
In the article, which is clearly slanted towards,

11:21.440 --> 11:23.440
they use the guy's worst photo.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.440
He's leaning against a Camaro flipping the finger.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.440
Every quote from him.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.440
He would post stuff to his Facebook page

11:31.440 --> 11:34.440
and then the guy that sentenced him,

11:34.440 --> 11:37.440
referenced him saying shit on the Facebook page,

11:37.440 --> 11:39.440
which is crazy.

11:39.440 --> 11:41.440
When they were sentencing him, they were like,

11:41.440 --> 11:43.440
clearly everything we need to know about your attitude

11:43.440 --> 11:45.440
is all in that Facebook post from yesterday.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.440
What the fuck? What are we in eighth grade?

11:47.440 --> 11:49.440
What kind of due?

11:49.440 --> 11:51.440
What in the due process?

11:51.440 --> 11:53.440
More like do not process.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.440
Don't process.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.440
Don't.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.440
What...

11:59.440 --> 12:01.440
How much money did he make?

12:01.440 --> 12:03.440
Well, they tabulated

12:03.440 --> 12:05.440
what he cost universal

12:05.440 --> 12:07.440
I think that's the studio.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.440
Oh.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.440
So all these people wouldn't go by the DVD?

12:11.440 --> 12:13.440
Yeah, because we all know that's

12:13.440 --> 12:15.440
exactly how everything works.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.440
Because we're all Sims.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.440
You'd only download a torrent

12:19.440 --> 12:21.440
of Fast and the Furious 6

12:21.440 --> 12:23.440
if you were unable

12:23.440 --> 12:25.440
to get out to the theaters

12:25.440 --> 12:27.440
and watch it.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.440
And of course, if you downloaded it,

12:29.440 --> 12:31.440
it means you definitely would have gone to the theater.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.440
That's the first erroneous

12:33.440 --> 12:35.440
piece of math.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.440
But they use a bunch of

12:37.440 --> 12:39.440
theoretical math to figure that this guy

12:39.440 --> 12:41.440
cost universal, I don't know,

12:41.440 --> 12:43.440
tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.

12:43.440 --> 12:45.440
You know, they tabulated.

12:45.440 --> 12:47.440
And...

12:47.440 --> 12:49.440
And...

12:49.440 --> 12:51.440
Obviously, it's just...

12:51.440 --> 12:53.440
Okay, so...

12:53.440 --> 12:55.440
Rich people run the world.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.440
The money makes the world go around.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.440
It should be a crime

12:59.440 --> 13:01.440
to fuck with rich people, I guess.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.440
I mean, it's their world.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.440
But why...

13:05.440 --> 13:07.440
Why put them in prison?

13:07.440 --> 13:09.440
Like, why...

13:09.440 --> 13:11.440
How much money is he going to make anybody in prison?

13:11.440 --> 13:13.440
Like, send them to...

13:13.440 --> 13:15.440
Send them to, like,

13:15.440 --> 13:17.440
Universal Studios Camp or something.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.440
Like, put them in a panda outfit

13:19.440 --> 13:21.440
and make them drive that tram.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.440
Yeah, like, make great

13:23.440 --> 13:25.440
theme parks that are, like, cheaper

13:25.440 --> 13:27.440
because they're peopled with criminals

13:27.440 --> 13:29.440
who stole

13:29.440 --> 13:31.440
movies or something.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.440
You know, like, oh, it's hot.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.440
It sure is hot in here.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.440
It'd be a lot less hot if I hadn't

13:37.440 --> 13:39.440
uh, for taking

13:39.440 --> 13:41.440
a hot, hot merchandise.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.440
If you can't stand the heat.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.440
Like, like, backdraft.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.440
Well, speaking of which,

13:47.440 --> 13:49.440
backdraft stunt shows starting over here.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.440
You know, it's like, they could just kind of

13:53.440 --> 13:55.440
blend confession with

13:55.440 --> 13:57.440
uh, with helping,

13:57.440 --> 13:59.440
helping paying customers.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.440
And then they work off their debt.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.440
Do it that way. Don't put people in prison.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.440
Unless they're going to stab somebody.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.440
This should be this

14:09.440 --> 14:11.440
pretty simple rule with prison, right?

14:11.440 --> 14:13.440
Like, when should you put a guy in a

14:13.440 --> 14:15.440
in a little cubicle that

14:15.440 --> 14:17.440
he can't get out of physically?

14:17.440 --> 14:19.440
When he would physically do something

14:19.440 --> 14:21.440
bad if he was out.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.440
What about, like, Bernie Madoff

14:23.440 --> 14:25.440
and a lot of people's lives?

14:25.440 --> 14:27.440
Well, first of all, do we really punish these people?

14:27.440 --> 14:29.440
I mean, that's an example of a guy

14:29.440 --> 14:31.440
doing time, right? Yeah, he's impressed.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.440
But, like, for, I mean

14:33.440 --> 14:35.440
not to get off on that tangent, but

14:35.440 --> 14:37.440
there's a pretty big disparity

14:37.440 --> 14:39.440
in the amount of these people that actually do

14:39.440 --> 14:41.440
see hard justice.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.440
Uh, so

14:43.440 --> 14:45.440
why not commit to that idea

14:45.440 --> 14:47.440
that anybody that commits a crime

14:47.440 --> 14:49.440
that is financial in origin

14:49.440 --> 14:51.440
has to suffer some kind of financial

14:51.440 --> 14:53.440
punishment, you know?

14:53.440 --> 14:55.440
What's the big deal? I don't get it.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.440
And also pills that make your toenails stop growing.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.440
That's it.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.440
I don't have all the answers.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.440
Uh, uh, tweet me,

15:03.440 --> 15:05.440
suck suck suck my dick.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.440
I don't care.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.440
Suck suck suck my dick?

15:09.440 --> 15:11.440
Well, obviously suck suck suck my dick

15:11.440 --> 15:13.440
and suck suck my dick were both taken.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.440
Because Twitter's been around for, like,

15:15.440 --> 15:17.440
15 years.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.440
Suck suck suck my dick.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.440
There's lots of underscores and shit like that.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.440
All right, all right.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.440
What else we got here?

15:25.440 --> 15:27.440
Oh, yeah, halfway through the Uber trip,

15:27.440 --> 15:29.440
silence for the half way,

15:29.440 --> 15:31.440
half the car ride,

15:31.440 --> 15:33.440
except for all that rigmarole in the beginning.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.440
Like, no, just follow the map.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.440
Remember driving, it's really quiet for a long time.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.440
And then, and then he just says,

15:39.440 --> 15:41.440
cool down, huh?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.440
And I,

15:43.440 --> 15:45.440
and it just made me,

15:45.440 --> 15:47.440
and I was like, yeah.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.440
And it made me, like, I mean,

15:49.440 --> 15:51.440
you know, this is not

15:51.440 --> 15:53.440
new territory to talk about, but, like,

15:53.440 --> 15:55.440
talking about weather, like, it really is insane.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.440
Because, like, what if we, what if he said

15:57.440 --> 15:59.440
cool down, huh? What if I had said no?

15:59.440 --> 16:01.440
I

16:01.440 --> 16:03.440
disagree. I don't think it has

16:03.440 --> 16:05.440
cooled down.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.440
Now we're in a small argument.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.440
Uh,

16:09.440 --> 16:11.440
uh, George

16:11.440 --> 16:13.440
Takei is a hero.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.440
Saw a documentary about him.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.440
Uh, you know what he did, Jeff?

16:17.440 --> 16:19.440
It just occurred to me.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.440
Aside from delighting us on TV for so many years.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.440
He's always been a delightful personality.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.440
You know, he's a little silly. He talks like this,

16:25.440 --> 16:27.440
no matter what he's talking about.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.440
Um, but, but this guy,

16:29.440 --> 16:31.440
and he's very happy, go lucky,

16:31.440 --> 16:33.440
and he's kind of talks like a game show host.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.440
But, but, I realize

16:35.440 --> 16:37.440
we'll watch the documentary. This guy has been,

16:37.440 --> 16:39.440
uh,

16:39.440 --> 16:41.440
I don't want to use too strong language, but

16:41.440 --> 16:43.440
I don't, I also don't want to

16:43.440 --> 16:45.440
stretch out a big long

16:45.440 --> 16:47.440
daisy chain of words

16:47.440 --> 16:49.440
just so it's not that strong. I mean,

16:49.440 --> 16:51.440
I, I realize that other people

16:51.440 --> 16:53.440
have had it harder than in their lives, but I just want to say,

16:53.440 --> 16:55.440
like George Takei as a jolly

16:55.440 --> 16:57.440
old man,

16:57.440 --> 16:59.440
he's been betrayed by his country twice

16:59.440 --> 17:01.440
in his lifetime, once because of his

17:01.440 --> 17:03.440
race, and once because of his orientation.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.440
Like he has had, he, he spent his

17:05.440 --> 17:07.440
childhood in a Japanese-American internment

17:07.440 --> 17:09.440
camp, and still, like,

17:09.440 --> 17:11.440
exited with enough, like,

17:11.440 --> 17:13.440
altruism, and, and,

17:13.440 --> 17:15.440
and magnanimity,

17:15.440 --> 17:17.440
and an optimism to, to

17:17.440 --> 17:19.440
have a good life, you know, if you, if

17:19.440 --> 17:21.440
you let that get you down, I'm sure a lot of people

17:21.440 --> 17:23.440
left those camps all fucked up,

17:23.440 --> 17:25.440
and bitter, and, and, and

17:25.440 --> 17:27.440
fucked for life.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.440
But, and then having done that, then he had to be,

17:29.440 --> 17:31.440
you know, he didn't have to be,

17:31.440 --> 17:33.440
but he kind of had to be

17:33.440 --> 17:35.440
in the closet for, for,

17:35.440 --> 17:37.440
you know, like, in order to get acting

17:37.440 --> 17:39.440
work and stuff, and, and then he,

17:39.440 --> 17:41.440
you know, it's like,

17:41.440 --> 17:43.440
the, the, the equal marriage rights thing,

17:43.440 --> 17:45.440
like, he found himself then at the forefront of

17:45.440 --> 17:47.440
that thing, it was like people telling him,

17:47.440 --> 17:49.440
you shouldn't be allowed to get married if you're gay.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.440
And every, every time, at each turn,

17:51.440 --> 17:53.440
this is a country that this guy loves,

17:53.440 --> 17:55.440
and he loves everybody, and he likes

17:55.440 --> 17:57.440
talking to people, and I like having conversations,

17:57.440 --> 17:59.440
and he's, and he's not, like, deluded,

17:59.440 --> 18:01.440
it's not like he's Regis Philbin, just like,

18:01.440 --> 18:09.440
oh, well, he's like, he's meeting head on, like, these controversies.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.440
He's like, he's transparent and honest and sincere

18:11.440 --> 18:13.440
when he talks about them, about his experiences

18:13.440 --> 18:15.440
at this camp, and his experiences, like, on the

18:15.440 --> 18:17.440
forefront of, of fighting for gay rights,

18:17.440 --> 18:19.440
and, and, and yet,

18:19.440 --> 18:21.440
but, but at no point does he do what I,

18:21.440 --> 18:23.440
what I did when the Ferguson thing

18:23.440 --> 18:25.440
happened, which is just, like, throw my

18:25.440 --> 18:27.440
hands in the air and get all mad and whiny

18:27.440 --> 18:29.440
and start screeching and tap on my lips.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.440
If everybody did that, we'd really be fucked.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.440
Like, it was kind of inspiring.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.440
I thought, you know, maybe if, always

18:35.440 --> 18:37.440
find the humor and, and the George Takei,

18:37.440 --> 18:39.440
those things. What was this documentary on?

18:39.440 --> 18:41.440
Uh, I don't know.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.440
The Takei Network, I don't know.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.440
Did I tell you that I was, I was on a plane with him,

18:45.440 --> 18:47.440
and we were, we were coming back from a gig,

18:47.440 --> 18:49.440
and it was like, I was with Greg Proups,

18:49.440 --> 18:51.440
and, and he sat across from us, and, like,

18:51.440 --> 18:53.440
we were, like, row two, and he was in row one,

18:53.440 --> 18:55.440
and, uh, it was like, fucking, Tzulu's on the fucking plane.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.440
Like, I was like, this plane can't crash.

18:57.440 --> 19:01.440
Everybody, everybody on the plane was like, we're, we're good.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.440
And, uh, and so we're boarding the plane,

19:03.440 --> 19:05.440
because we, we had been with him in security,

19:05.440 --> 19:07.440
and he was in front of us checking in,

19:07.440 --> 19:09.440
but then he got, he was with, like, his, like,

19:09.440 --> 19:11.440
assistant or handler or wrangler or, or maybe,

19:11.440 --> 19:13.440
maybe companion, I don't know, like,

19:13.440 --> 19:15.440
buddy, friend, boyfriend, I had no idea,

19:15.440 --> 19:17.440
but I think Tzulu was, Tzulu, goddammit.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.440
George, George Takei was a little under the

19:19.440 --> 19:21.440
weather, he had, like, kind of a cough,

19:21.440 --> 19:23.440
and this guy was, like, keeping him, like, you know,

19:23.440 --> 19:25.440
like, making sure he was warm and stuff,

19:25.440 --> 19:27.440
and he was very attentive and nice.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.440
And then we kept getting in front of him,

19:29.440 --> 19:31.440
and, uh, so we were in, uh,

19:31.440 --> 19:33.440
Greg was in front of him getting on a plane,

19:33.440 --> 19:35.440
I was behind him, and he gets on,

19:35.440 --> 19:37.440
and the guy who's beep, whoop,

19:37.440 --> 19:39.440
like, thank you, Mr. Davis, whoop, thank you, Mr. Bruce,

19:39.440 --> 19:41.440
whoop, Mr. George Takei.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.440
And, and George, he goes, well, hello.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.440
And then he goes, and he goes,

19:45.440 --> 19:47.440
uh, I'm, I'm a big fan of yours,

19:47.440 --> 19:49.440
Mr. Takei, well, thank you very much,

19:49.440 --> 19:51.440
it's very nice to hear.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.440
And then he goes, and I forget the show,

19:53.440 --> 19:55.440
but he's on, like, uh,

19:55.440 --> 19:57.440
like a family guy or something like that.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.440
He'd guest start on some show or whatever.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.440
Was it? Yeah.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.440
Family guy. And he goes, I saw your family guy,

20:03.440 --> 20:05.440
and I said, oh, that's very good news,

20:05.440 --> 20:07.440
I can expect a residual.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.440
Yeah.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.440
And he and his husband are very, uh,

20:11.440 --> 20:13.440
they're a cute couple,

20:13.440 --> 20:15.440
they're very, very inspiring to, to,

20:15.440 --> 20:17.440
you know, they're an older couple now,

20:17.440 --> 20:19.440
but they're, they're, and they're not,

20:19.440 --> 20:21.440
like, making out with each other,

20:21.440 --> 20:23.440
and every step they're trying to prove something,

20:23.440 --> 20:25.440
but they're clearly in love,

20:25.440 --> 20:27.440
and they're like soulmates,

20:27.440 --> 20:29.440
and they walk around hand in hand,

20:29.440 --> 20:31.440
and it's a, it's a, it's a,

20:31.440 --> 20:33.440
check out the documentary, it's a cute little thing,

20:33.440 --> 20:35.440
I don't know what it's called, beam, beam me,

20:35.440 --> 20:37.440
beam me over to you.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.440
It should be

20:39.440 --> 20:41.440
beam me out.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.440
Beam me out.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.440
Of the closet, I don't know.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.440
Of the, of the internment camp,

20:47.440 --> 20:49.440
of the closet.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.440
Beam me out.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.440
Uh, everywhere it goes,

20:53.440 --> 20:55.440
someone's trying to keep me in somewhere.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.440
Where was this beaming technology when I needed it?

20:57.440 --> 20:59.440
All right.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.440
Well, that's the end of my notes.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.440
I, I think that, uh,

21:03.440 --> 21:05.440
I wore the wrong shirt,

21:05.440 --> 21:07.440
or it's these, it's these goddamn lights.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.440
I was thinking, maybe it's a good color on you.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.440
You look, you look very dynamic.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.440
Well, it absorbs heat. I should have worn, uh, tin foil.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.440
I don't think that would work either.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.440
That would keep it in.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.440
It would be like a potato.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.440
I should have worn mirrors,

21:23.440 --> 21:25.440
like the lady in dance hall days.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.440
It's there to reflect everything outward.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.440
I bet that lady in dance hall days

21:33.440 --> 21:35.440
was cold as a cucumber,

21:35.440 --> 21:37.440
when she comes out of the disco ball

21:37.440 --> 21:39.440
and she's covered in disco mirrors.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.440
We were so in phase.

21:41.440 --> 21:45.440
In my dance hall days.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.440
Is it from the video?

21:49.440 --> 21:51.440
Chris.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.440
Wait.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.440
Sing all the words.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.440
I don't open my mouth.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.440
A napkin's on my shoe.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.440
I never knew the words of that song.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.440
Take your baby by the heel.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.440
Take her by the heel?

22:09.440 --> 22:11.440
No.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.440
That's by the hand for sure.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.440
He says hand and then he says heel later.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.440
What?

22:17.440 --> 22:19.440
Yeah.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.440
Does he really?

22:21.440 --> 22:23.440
Yeah, look it up.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.440
And look up fingernails and fasten the furious.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.440
www.SuckSuckSuckMyDick.com

22:29.440 --> 22:31.440
Let's bring up an early Spencer Crittenden.

22:31.440 --> 22:43.440
Really? Chris Crittenden?

22:43.440 --> 22:45.440
Just to get out of these lights, man.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.440
Can I get out?

22:47.440 --> 22:49.440
It's like one of those things it's like...

22:49.440 --> 22:51.440
Oh, that's nice of him.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.440
Well, I don't want to be responsible

22:53.440 --> 22:55.440
for people being unable to see me.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.440
No, we can still see you.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.440
You still reflect light.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.440
Hello?

23:01.440 --> 23:03.440
Hey!

23:03.440 --> 23:05.440
Spencer, you're on at 8.26?

23:05.440 --> 23:07.440
8.27. Is that the earliest you've ever been at her?

23:07.440 --> 23:09.440
I don't know, man.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.440
Maybe on this stage.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.440
It's not a...

23:13.440 --> 23:15.440
Spencer, did you get high since I last saw you

23:15.440 --> 23:17.440
five minutes ago?

23:17.440 --> 23:19.440
No, I got a...

23:19.440 --> 23:21.440
I'm feeling just weird in the stomach.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.440
It's throwing me off.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.440
I'm having a good time, though.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.440
I'm glad to be here.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.440
No, I'm sure I will

23:29.440 --> 23:31.440
before this day is done.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.440
But right now, I'm here.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.440
I'm seated, ready to do some comedy.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.440
Did you eat some...

23:37.440 --> 23:39.440
Did you eat a misguided burrito or something?

23:39.440 --> 23:41.440
I think I did, yeah.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.440
I went to 7-Eleven and I got two taquitos,

23:43.440 --> 23:45.440
and they were really delicious,

23:45.440 --> 23:47.440
and I've never had them before,

23:47.440 --> 23:49.440
but I'm already like, no.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.440
Here's the thing, 7-Eleven,

23:51.440 --> 23:53.440
they have all this food that's like crappy food,

23:53.440 --> 23:55.440
and it's all...

23:55.440 --> 23:57.440
It has a flavor, but it also has this consistency

23:57.440 --> 23:59.440
that's very microwaved.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.440
But the thing is,

24:01.440 --> 24:03.440
I eat food that I cook in the microwave.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.440
So, like, it's not that big of a deal, right?

24:05.440 --> 24:07.440
But, you know, the taquitos...

24:07.440 --> 24:09.440
Are these taquitos the ones that are rolling around?

24:09.440 --> 24:11.440
Yeah, they're those rolling taquitos.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.440
I get a lot of hot dogs,

24:13.440 --> 24:15.440
no incident, but, man.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.440
Taquitos.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.440
I don't think a 7-Eleven is a food destination, really.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.440
Well, that's the thing.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.440
That's why you can't complain too much,

24:23.440 --> 24:25.440
like, would you come here, right?

24:25.440 --> 24:27.440
But, uh, no.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.440
I mean, I was just, I got, you know,

24:29.440 --> 24:31.440
I came into the meltdown, I parked.

24:31.440 --> 24:33.440
I was like, let's go to 7-Eleven, you know?

24:33.440 --> 24:35.440
I would rather have, like, a big bucket of noodles,

24:35.440 --> 24:37.440
but that wasn't on the table.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.440
Is bucket of noodles still open?

24:39.440 --> 24:41.440
Yeah, well, not on Sundays.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.440
That's the thing, they're all Christian.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.440
It's sad, really.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.440
A big, uh, ramen,

24:47.440 --> 24:49.440
big, big, big bucket of ramen.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.440
Without even that much soup in it.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.440
Just eat a big brick of ramen

24:53.440 --> 24:55.440
that's, like, lightly boiled.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.440
That's what I'd like to do.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.440
Make me feel 25 again.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.440
Today's cheat day.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.440
What did you have for cheat day?

25:03.440 --> 25:05.440
I found out,

25:05.440 --> 25:07.440
Erin came back from, uh,

25:07.440 --> 25:09.440
from wherever she was, and she, uh,

25:09.440 --> 25:11.440
I was looking, I was like,

25:11.440 --> 25:13.440
well, it's cheat day, so I'm,

25:13.440 --> 25:15.440
I could eat anything I want,

25:15.440 --> 25:17.440
but then I was playing Minecraft,

25:17.440 --> 25:19.440
and I was too lazy to get up to eat

25:19.440 --> 25:21.440
and, uh... Did you waste a cheat day?

25:21.440 --> 25:23.440
And then I thought I was, because it was, like,

25:23.440 --> 25:25.440
4.30 when Erin came back,

25:25.440 --> 25:27.440
and I was like, fuck, man,

25:27.440 --> 25:29.440
we got some catching up to do,

25:29.440 --> 25:31.440
and she said, what do you mean?

25:31.440 --> 25:33.440
I said, cheat day, she said,

25:33.440 --> 25:35.440
we don't get a cheat day this week.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.440
I said, why?

25:37.440 --> 25:39.440
She's like, we had pizza on Wednesday.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.440
Wednesday?

25:41.440 --> 25:43.440
I don't even remember.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.440
We cheated on Wednesday.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.440
Boo!

25:47.440 --> 25:49.440
It wasn't even good pizza, whatever it was.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.440
It was like...

25:51.440 --> 25:53.440
Now she's going to spin class every day.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.440
She's on day 7, I believe, right?

25:55.440 --> 25:57.440
Are you gonna, is that gonna inspire you

25:57.440 --> 25:59.440
to maybe get a little fitness kick yourself?

25:59.440 --> 26:01.440
I am on a fitness kick.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.440
This isn't as fitness kick as I get.

26:03.440 --> 26:05.440
It's trying to be on a diet.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.440
I'm not gonna go to spin class, no.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.440
It's not gonna happen.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.440
You should go, it's a lot of fun.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.440
Uh, Douglas Adams died on a treadmill.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.440
Is he dead?

26:15.440 --> 26:17.440
You know...

26:17.440 --> 26:19.440
I don't know a lot of things about people.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.440
I mean, who keeps track of who died?

26:21.440 --> 26:23.440
That seems like depressing, right?

26:23.440 --> 26:25.440
Well, I wasn't trying to keep track.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.440
I...

26:27.440 --> 26:29.440
Well, I was just being defensive.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.440
Oh, really defensive.

26:31.440 --> 26:33.440
It's nothing you've done.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.440
I brought you up here early because

26:35.440 --> 26:37.440
you made a new friend.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.440
Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, I guess.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.440
Spencer's been hanging out

26:41.440 --> 26:43.440
with a mutual friend of ours.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.440
He's been really logging some quality time with them.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.440
And he just...

26:47.440 --> 26:49.440
It's a blossoming friendship.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.440
Do you feel jealous?

26:51.440 --> 26:53.440
No, I'm very curious.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.440
Yeah, I mean, yeah,

26:55.440 --> 26:57.440
that's what you're curious about.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.440
Uh, should we bring him out

26:59.440 --> 27:01.440
and talk about your friendship?

27:01.440 --> 27:03.440
You do whatever you want, man.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.440
Do you think it'll negatively affect the friendship

27:05.440 --> 27:07.440
to talk about it?

27:07.440 --> 27:09.440
I mean, it couldn't help.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.440
No, no, do it.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.440
All right. Ladies and gentlemen,

27:15.440 --> 27:17.440
Jack Nicholson.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.440
No, it's...

27:19.440 --> 27:21.440
It's Nicholas Cage.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.440
Whatever it was, that would be great.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.440
Let's bring to the stage

27:25.440 --> 27:27.440
Spencer's new friend,

27:27.440 --> 27:29.440
Real Abed. Abed Gheith.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.440
Abed Gheith to the stage.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.440
Real Abed.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.440
Real Abed.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.440
Real Abed.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.440
Slightly less dimensionalized

27:39.440 --> 27:41.440
than my creation.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.440
Oh, yeah!

27:43.440 --> 27:45.440
Woo!

27:45.440 --> 27:47.440
I killed the song, didn't I?

27:47.440 --> 27:49.440
No, you tagged it.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.440
It's been a while since you've been up here.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.440
Can I say something? So those lights, the new ones?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.440
Oh, you mean these ones?

27:57.440 --> 27:59.440
Yeah.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.440
I mean, when you're talking to me

28:01.440 --> 28:03.440
of the restaurant at Pirates of the Caribbean,

28:03.440 --> 28:05.440
remember when you go by and you're like,

28:05.440 --> 28:07.440
fuck, I'm going to eat at that restaurant tonight.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.440
Yeah, yeah.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.440
I keep going, I'm wanting to do it, I never do it.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.440
It's just the time. I'm going to do it this time.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.440
I had the same memory.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.440
That's exactly what I was thinking of last week.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.440
I called it something like a Caribbean bungalow

28:19.440 --> 28:21.440
or something like that.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.440
It didn't sound like it made any sense,

28:23.440 --> 28:25.440
but that's what I was thinking of,

28:25.440 --> 28:27.440
is that fucking restaurant that you go through

28:27.440 --> 28:29.440
is like the most amazing restaurant.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.440
It looks like it would be great to eat there.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.440
It's not that great.

28:33.440 --> 28:35.440
No, the conversation from that side.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.440
Oh, those people are really into the ride.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.440
It looks like a great restaurant.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.440
No, those people, they're kind of into it,

28:41.440 --> 28:43.440
but one person's scared.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.440
Once in a while, when you're on that ride,

28:45.440 --> 28:47.440
when you're on Pirates of the Caribbean

28:47.440 --> 28:49.440
and you just start moving

28:49.440 --> 28:51.440
and right in the right is the Blue Bayou restaurant,

28:51.440 --> 28:53.440
it's really quiet.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.440
It's very tranquil.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.440
What was Pirates of the Caribbean the restaurant?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.440
Pirates of the Caribbean of the restaurant.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.440
Oh, that's the Pirates of the Caribbean the ride restaurant.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.440
Pirates of the Caribbean, the movie,

29:05.440 --> 29:07.440
the ride, the restaurant.

29:07.440 --> 29:11.440
It'd be amazing if on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride,

29:11.440 --> 29:13.440
you started as regular passengers

29:13.440 --> 29:15.440
and then like most of those rides,

29:15.440 --> 29:17.440
you get kind of indoctrinated into the thing.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.440
If you got actually turned into a pirate

29:19.440 --> 29:21.440
on the ride,

29:21.440 --> 29:23.440
and then at the end, you got to

29:23.440 --> 29:25.440
change the restaurant, steal somebody's butter.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.440
Yeah, you get it, you get it.

29:27.440 --> 29:29.440
Now go get them, hardies!

29:29.440 --> 29:31.440
Fuck you, give me your butter.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.440
I've seen some of these old pirate movies,

29:33.440 --> 29:35.440
they don't fuck around.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.440
They really stab and bite

29:37.440 --> 29:39.440
and like cling to the barnacle

29:39.440 --> 29:41.440
like there's no tomorrow.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.440
What movie did you see a pirate

29:43.440 --> 29:45.440
clinging to a barnacle?

29:45.440 --> 29:47.440
It was Blackbeard, the pirate.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.440
It was that movie.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.440
It was really awesome, but it was fucked up, man.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.440
Blackbeard is quite a character.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.440
Barnacles are famous for their clinging.

29:55.440 --> 29:57.440
It's like Mike Treasure,

29:57.440 --> 29:59.440
and it's like you can't fuck with him.

29:59.440 --> 30:01.440
I was like, I'd never fuck with Blackbeard.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.440
I would never fuck with him.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.440
I would see you being a pretty valuable

30:09.440 --> 30:11.440
shipmate on a pirate ship.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.440
If I were a captain, I think I could put you to some good use.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.440
You look like you could tie some knots.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.440
Yeah, I could tie knots.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.440
I could do that,

30:21.440 --> 30:23.440
but I would choose to just be like

30:23.440 --> 30:25.440
a survivor.

30:25.440 --> 30:27.440
I'd probably hide like high up.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.440
So whenever there's a crazy mutiny,

30:29.440 --> 30:31.440
I'm just like watching it like, oh my god.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.440
Oh my god. Good thing I climbed up here. Holy shit.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.440
Every time there's a mutiny...

30:35.440 --> 30:37.440
But what if Blackbeard...

30:37.440 --> 30:39.440
What if your captain is Blackbeard and he goes,

30:39.440 --> 30:41.440
argh, man, get down here and join the fray.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.440
Call me argh, man. Get down here.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.440
How can you not be partaking in this week's mutiny?

30:45.440 --> 30:47.440
See, I would be the ship's jester,

30:47.440 --> 30:49.440
so that would suck.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.440
So you'd always know if I was missing.

30:51.440 --> 30:53.440
Yeah, where is that argh bed?

30:53.440 --> 30:55.440
Arh comedy.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.440
So they would just call you argh bed because

30:57.440 --> 30:59.440
they wouldn't be able to pronounce argh.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.440
I know, yeah.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.440
He just looks like argh, yeah.

31:03.440 --> 31:05.440
He gets mad when he starts saying it,

31:05.440 --> 31:07.440
so he's like argh, and then he remembers bed,

31:07.440 --> 31:09.440
and he goes, argh, argh, argh, argh.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.440
I always wonder that, too.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.440
Like, could you climb up like up there?

31:13.440 --> 31:15.440
And could you just stay out of trouble?

31:15.440 --> 31:17.440
I think so, because they had this cool

31:17.440 --> 31:19.440
Swiss downy Robinson deal.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.440
I think you're a sitting duck up there.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.440
People have harkabuses and blunderbuses and whatnot,

31:23.440 --> 31:25.440
so you're a sitting duck up there.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.440
But if no one sees you,

31:27.440 --> 31:29.440
you climb out in the middle of the night

31:29.440 --> 31:31.440
when everyone's stuffed away.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.440
Was there a rumor about harkabuses?

31:33.440 --> 31:35.440
Yeah, what is that?

31:35.440 --> 31:37.440
It's another matchlocked guy that's long.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.440
It's like a precursor, I believe, to a blunderbuse.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.440
It's like a longer rifle.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.440
It's pretty nuts, you tell ya.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.440
The old ones.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.440
It looks like you're on the ride.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.440
It's amazing.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.440
Everything looks like a set.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.440
It's beautiful.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.440
You don't ever shiver my timbers?

31:55.440 --> 31:57.440
That's from...

31:57.440 --> 31:59.440
God, are you in the bounty?

31:59.440 --> 32:01.440
Now you have to answer.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.440
Why did you just leap into it?

32:03.440 --> 32:05.440
Oh, I got that one.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.440
Okay, I got this one, guys.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.440
I don't know for sure.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.440
Where would you think

32:11.440 --> 32:13.440
real Abed

32:13.440 --> 32:15.440
that's different from Timbers?

32:15.440 --> 32:17.440
I would say it would have to be

32:17.440 --> 32:19.440
an old Pirate movie,

32:19.440 --> 32:21.440
but it might be a Pirate series.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.440
I'm going to go with Pirate movie.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.440
Maybe it's Captain

32:25.440 --> 32:27.440
Courageous or something?

32:27.440 --> 32:29.440
Captain's Courageous?

32:29.440 --> 32:31.440
I believe it actually comes from actual

32:31.440 --> 32:33.440
Pirate terminology.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.440
I assume it's just your boat's made out of wood,

32:35.440 --> 32:37.440
and if it's shivering,

32:37.440 --> 32:39.440
it's really scary out.

32:39.440 --> 32:41.440
The foremost way

32:41.440 --> 32:43.440
of knowing that you're in deep shit

32:43.440 --> 32:45.440
is that your timbers are shaken.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.440
Your boat's like creaking.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.440
From what I read,

32:49.440 --> 32:51.440
one of the most common injuries

32:51.440 --> 32:53.440
when you got hit by a broadside cannonball,

32:53.440 --> 32:55.440
it wasn't the cannonball that was likely to hit you.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.440
It was going to hit the wood,

32:57.440 --> 32:59.440
and you would get hit by splinters,

32:59.440 --> 33:01.440
and they called those shivers.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.440
So you died by getting Schrab.eled with wood.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.440
If it didn't kill you outright,

33:05.440 --> 33:07.440
you'd get infected eventually

33:07.440 --> 33:09.440
because you just had gross rotting shipwood

33:09.440 --> 33:11.440
stuck in your body.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.440
Shipwood, huh?

33:13.440 --> 33:15.440
I thought it's just the guy's balls,

33:15.440 --> 33:17.440
and he's like pulled,

33:17.440 --> 33:19.440
and he's like, oh, my timbers are shivering.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.440
That's what I thought.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.440
It's something funny like that.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.440
He leaps into this dark,

33:25.440 --> 33:27.440
like splinters attacking you

33:27.440 --> 33:29.440
like a crazy Hellraiser movie.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.440
What's with that guy?

33:31.440 --> 33:33.440
What is he crazy?

33:33.440 --> 33:35.440
So you and Spencer have been hanging out?

33:35.440 --> 33:37.440
Well, you know, it's funny that you say this

33:37.440 --> 33:39.440
because, like...

33:39.440 --> 33:41.440
It's odd that he says that.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.440
Is that better?

33:43.440 --> 33:45.440
It's the premise.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.440
It's strange that you would bring that up

33:47.440 --> 33:49.440
because it's the topic of the conversation

33:49.440 --> 33:51.440
that just started.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.440
It's a crazy that you bring up.

33:53.440 --> 33:55.440
Interesting enough.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.440
I don't know, but see,

33:57.440 --> 33:59.440
I've been with his friend from the get-go

33:59.440 --> 34:01.440
from the first time I hung out

34:01.440 --> 34:03.440
with him here a couple of times.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.440
From Jump Street.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.440
I would be at that crazy karaoke place,

34:07.440 --> 34:09.440
and for some reason,

34:09.440 --> 34:11.440
me and him always just clicked.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.440
I would just make jokes, and then he would laugh.

34:13.440 --> 34:15.440
And then we'd just hang out,

34:15.440 --> 34:17.440
and I found out this guy likes muffins.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.440
He likes Magic the Gathering.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.440
We find that we have stuff in common.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.440
This is kind of weird to me because

34:23.440 --> 34:25.440
Spencer's not a big laugher,

34:25.440 --> 34:27.440
and you're not...

34:27.440 --> 34:29.440
And he hates muffins.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.440
Yeah, they would feel like,

34:31.440 --> 34:33.440
how do I get the map away from here?

34:33.440 --> 34:35.440
Well, their laughter limits

34:35.440 --> 34:37.440
would be tested.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.440
I take people to laughter limits.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.440
I find it very easy to be dry

34:41.440 --> 34:43.440
when I'm listening to you make jokes.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.440
I'm not tempted to, like, guffaw.

34:45.440 --> 34:47.440
Every relationship I have

34:47.440 --> 34:49.440
in that sense is like,

34:49.440 --> 34:51.440
I'm always the Castello

34:51.440 --> 34:53.440
and everyone else is the Abbot,

34:53.440 --> 34:55.440
just like, what are you doing now?

34:55.440 --> 34:57.440
Really? Come on, Castello.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.440
Abbotify a planet.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.440
Yeah, I'll just be like, well, you know,

35:01.440 --> 35:03.440
Abbot, it's Babadoo.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.440
Nobody really...

35:05.440 --> 35:07.440
They're like, we're in a supermarket.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.440
What is happening that's Babadoo?

35:09.440 --> 35:11.440
I don't understand.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.440
Yeah, it's like, they look around.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.440
You have to kind of put on the parental hat

35:15.440 --> 35:17.440
to be like, all right, what is really...

35:17.440 --> 35:19.440
Can we just get to the bottom of why I came here?

35:19.440 --> 35:21.440
So where do you guys hang out?

35:21.440 --> 35:23.440
Do you guys go get supered?

35:23.440 --> 35:25.440
We hang out at a place.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.440
Portos? Yeah, we go to the bakery.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.440
Portos.

35:29.440 --> 35:31.440
You get pornos.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.440
We go to 7-Eleven.

35:33.440 --> 35:35.440
Back-to-back though, nothing weird.

35:35.440 --> 35:37.440
They sell muffins and pornography.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.440
Have you rented the movie Shipwood?

35:39.440 --> 35:41.440
Shipwood!

35:41.440 --> 35:43.440
Dude, if I ever got Shipwood,

35:43.440 --> 35:45.440
you'd have to put a bullet in the car.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.440
There's no turning back from Shipwood.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.440
What was the crossover for you guys being acquaintances

35:49.440 --> 35:51.440
that you met through Mutual Friends?

35:51.440 --> 35:53.440
No, I met through you guys being the Mutual Friends.

35:53.440 --> 35:55.440
I mean, most recently,

35:55.440 --> 35:57.440
it was when we went to

35:57.440 --> 35:59.440
the fair together.

35:59.440 --> 36:01.440
I think the Renaissance fair.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.440
Was that it? I think we were hanging out a few times before that.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.440
But I mean, most recently, yeah.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.440
So right behind my back.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.440
Like, I was there.

36:09.440 --> 36:11.440
In front of your face, I mean, you were there too.

36:11.440 --> 36:13.440
Like, under my nose and behind my back.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.440
So you are jealous about this?

36:15.440 --> 36:17.440
I told you.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.440
You were there on the trip.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.440
I'm not jealous.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.440
I'd like to be notified

36:23.440 --> 36:25.440
of new friendships.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.440
I don't want to have to find out about them.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.440
Should I notify you about every friendship that I had?

36:29.440 --> 36:31.440
Well, can I tell you something like,

36:31.440 --> 36:33.440
my friendships are weird.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.440
I was just watching.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.440
I remember

36:37.440 --> 36:39.440
there's this one time I was driving around

36:39.440 --> 36:41.440
because I was smoking. It was early morning

36:41.440 --> 36:43.440
on a Sunday morning.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.440
And you were on Twitter and you were talking about

36:45.440 --> 36:47.440
how you were driving around in the morning on Twitter.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.440
And then we started tweeting at each other

36:49.440 --> 36:51.440
while we were driving.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.440
And we were like, we should go run our cars and do each other.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.440
No, yeah, because we made a joke.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.440
Because I was like, wait a minute.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.440
If he's tweeting and driving, it's a little dangerous.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.440
You guys get up early in the morning and go to a bakery?

37:01.440 --> 37:03.440
Well, first off, I was up all night actually.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.440
He was up this morning.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.440
I was up all night because of those amazing breakfast burritos

37:07.440 --> 37:09.440
by my house. And I'm like, I'm going to get him this time.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.440
And like, I waited, I waited.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.440
And it was like 6 a.m.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.440
And I'm like, and I'm tweeting about it because I'm like,

37:15.440 --> 37:17.440
I got to stay awake for that burrito.

37:17.440 --> 37:19.440
So I drove around and stayed awake.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.440
But we were tweeting each other.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.440
Oh, wait, you talk.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.440
I'm jealous because your lives are more exciting than mine.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.440
They're not that exciting.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.440
They're exciting.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.440
I haven't looked forward to anything that much

37:31.440 --> 37:33.440
in the last 20 years.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.440
So we were driving around,

37:35.440 --> 37:37.440
waiting.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.440
What did they have?

37:39.440 --> 37:41.440
When you guys hang out, do you talk at the same time?

37:41.440 --> 37:43.440
No, it's kind of like, it's give and take.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.440
Sometimes I got to hold back, sometimes he's got to hold back.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.440
I'm holding back.

37:47.440 --> 37:49.440
You know what I mean?

37:49.440 --> 37:51.440
It's like tug of war.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.440
Now he's going to tug.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.440
It's a real contest of war.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.440
What does it look like?

37:57.440 --> 37:59.440
As someone who's known you for 9 to 13 years,

37:59.440 --> 38:01.440
I'd like to know what it looks like

38:01.440 --> 38:03.440
when you hold back.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.440
Show me.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.440
I guess if I'm mad, I'll just be quiet.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.440
It's weird. It sucks.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.440
Yeah, he's usually mad.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.440
Just show me for a second.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.440
So, Abed.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.440
Man, I really love alternative music.

38:17.440 --> 38:19.440
I wish there was somebody I could talk to about it.

38:19.440 --> 38:21.440
That's not very holding it back.

38:21.440 --> 38:23.440
That's not very holding it back.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.440
That's not very holding it back.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.440
That's not very holding it back.

38:27.440 --> 38:29.440
No, actually, I don't really have much to say about

38:29.440 --> 38:31.440
a turnholder.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.440
I mean, that's in the answer.

38:33.440 --> 38:35.440
I mean, that's in what it is.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.440
Yeah, I didn't land that bit very well.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.440
No, no, no, no. I don't have a theory on that.

38:39.440 --> 38:41.440
Like, if you maybe had to change the topic,

38:41.440 --> 38:43.440
maybe that would be harder for me to resist.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.440
Yeah, I wish I knew more about tornadoes

38:45.440 --> 38:47.440
or nuclear subs.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.440
Oh, he's holding back.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.440
That's more Spencer's bailiwick, I would think.

38:51.440 --> 38:53.440
Sure is, yeah. What do you need to know?

38:53.440 --> 38:55.440
Well, um...

38:55.440 --> 38:57.440
See, you guys complement it.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.440
You guys complete each other.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.440
That's what it is. I saw this movie.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.440
It's like if Wikipedia was hanging out with...

39:03.440 --> 39:05.440
I don't know, Grindr? What are you?

39:05.440 --> 39:07.440
Grindr?

39:07.440 --> 39:09.440
I don't know how to characterize you.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.440
Grindr?

39:11.440 --> 39:13.440
Grindr?

39:13.440 --> 39:15.440
Is that the perfect storm?

39:15.440 --> 39:17.440
It's like a cake website

39:17.440 --> 39:19.440
when you buy cakes.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.440
Then I am like, what is this, Grindr?

39:21.440 --> 39:23.440
Like, you grind shit? No, I know what it is.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.440
Spencer, do you have a take on nuclear subs?

39:25.440 --> 39:27.440
I saw you kind of light up over there.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.440
Oh, I mean, they're not really nuclear.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.440
It's a common misconception.

39:31.440 --> 39:33.440
See, he would hold back.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.440
They run on a nuclear fuel source, don't they?

39:35.440 --> 39:37.440
Well, they run on a nucleated fuel source.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.440
What's the difference, Spencer Critten?

39:39.440 --> 39:41.440
That's a word, nucleated. Did you just make that up?

39:41.440 --> 39:43.440
Yeah, I did.

39:45.440 --> 39:47.440
No, I was like, I've never heard that before.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.440
Guys, I mean...

39:49.440 --> 39:51.440
I was intrigued. I was like, oh, my God, my vocabulary.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.440
I want to go get a muffin with you guys so bad.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.440
Yeah.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.440
We haven't been the last few times.

39:57.440 --> 40:01.440
There's also a zany comic candy shop right next door.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.440
Yeah, Rocket Fizz.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.440
Yeah, it's like got crazy things like candy from the 70s.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.440
It's probably been there since the 70s.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.440
It's... yeah.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.440
I'm jealous, too, now. I don't know if you are.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.440
I don't like anything that's going on up here.

40:13.440 --> 40:15.440
It's not very often. I mean, we just played Magic today.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.440
It was fun.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.440
For like six hours, right?

40:19.440 --> 40:21.440
No, I fucking can play that game until the cows come home.

40:21.440 --> 40:23.440
It's a great game, Magic.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.440
It's really...

40:25.440 --> 40:27.440
I bet you were saying backstage that you felt a little guilty

40:27.440 --> 40:29.440
because you attacked Spencer and you felt like he didn't take it well,

40:29.440 --> 40:31.440
but you said that's part...

40:31.440 --> 40:33.440
Oh, yeah, well, because when we play Magic,

40:33.440 --> 40:35.440
we don't get anyone here that doesn't play Magic.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.440
I doubt it.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.440
But anyway, much like this guy's Minecraft obsession,

40:39.440 --> 40:41.440
like, I played Magic when I was in high school.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.440
I really liked it. I was really good at it.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.440
And then I just put it away for a while,

40:45.440 --> 40:47.440
and then every once in a while I'll meet someone

40:47.440 --> 40:49.440
that wants to play and my deck is still sitting there.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.440
So I'm like, all right, might as well dust this off.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.440
And we played and, like,

40:53.440 --> 40:55.440
I noticed something that when we played in a group,

40:55.440 --> 40:57.440
if, like, let's say I attacked Spencer,

40:57.440 --> 40:59.440
he's going to feel like,

40:59.440 --> 41:01.440
oh, man, are you pissed off of me or something?

41:01.440 --> 41:03.440
I'm really outraged.

41:03.440 --> 41:05.440
Yeah, it's like, it's mad.

41:05.440 --> 41:07.440
And it's like, it's not personal, dude.

41:07.440 --> 41:09.440
It's a game.

41:09.440 --> 41:11.440
It's personal.

41:11.440 --> 41:13.440
This guy's amassing a crazy army.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.440
I have to stop him.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.440
It's like nothing to do with me liking or not liking Spencer.

41:17.440 --> 41:19.440
And then, like, no matter what, he'll get mad.

41:19.440 --> 41:21.440
Just like, all right, now I'm going to really fuck him up.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.440
We play in these big groups, and it's all political.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.440
So, like, I become a character.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.440
I tell people what to do and, like,

41:27.440 --> 41:29.440
try and get people to do things that benefit me

41:29.440 --> 41:31.440
because it's a big part of it.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.440
Yeah, he's like kind of like the puppet master.

41:33.440 --> 41:35.440
I don't know the game.

41:35.440 --> 41:37.440
Is there a dungeon master or is everybody a player?

41:37.440 --> 41:39.440
No, you're all playing the same game, but, you know,

41:39.440 --> 41:41.440
in theory, it's like you're all fighting.

41:41.440 --> 41:43.440
So if I was like, hey, man, it'd be better

41:43.440 --> 41:45.440
if you punched him in the face here and then I could kick him in the leg.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.440
It's kind of like that, where it's like,

41:47.440 --> 41:49.440
if you do this here, that'll help me out,

41:49.440 --> 41:51.440
but I'm trying to convince you why I would help you out, too.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.440
Imagine if you could be as violent as possible

41:53.440 --> 41:55.440
with spells and creatures,

41:55.440 --> 41:57.440
but no, like, there's no drawbacks.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.440
Like, no one's going to put you in jail.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.440
I mean, that's where this guy shines.

42:01.440 --> 42:03.440
He comes through like a fucking zenith

42:03.440 --> 42:05.440
and he's just like, crazy zenith,

42:05.440 --> 42:07.440
Phoenix, and then he just, like,

42:07.440 --> 42:09.440
just destroys and it takes everyone apart.

42:09.440 --> 42:11.440
It's, it's...

42:11.440 --> 42:13.440
He beat me with, like, 900 points.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.440
They dealt 900 damage to him.

42:15.440 --> 42:17.440
Yeah, and I'm like, 900, like,

42:17.440 --> 42:19.440
I'd have to be playing this game for 70 hours

42:19.440 --> 42:21.440
to get 900 points.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.440
Normally you do 20 damage to kill someone as well.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.440
Yeah, I know.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.440
It's magic power.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.440
Yeah, well, the bakery part's like...

42:29.440 --> 42:33.440
I just had lost time.

42:33.440 --> 42:35.440
Like on X-Files?

42:35.440 --> 42:37.440
Yeah, that's what I said.

42:37.440 --> 42:41.440
The clock just changed from 839 to 849.

42:41.440 --> 42:43.440
That conversation proves

42:43.440 --> 42:45.440
there's a paranormal

42:45.440 --> 42:47.440
force in the world.

42:47.440 --> 42:49.440
It's a paranormal.

42:49.440 --> 42:51.440
It's evidence of the unknown.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.440
Yeah, evidence of the

42:53.440 --> 42:55.440
evidence of the paranormal that are normal.

42:55.440 --> 42:57.440
Uh...

42:57.440 --> 42:59.440
No, they'd be more like

42:59.440 --> 43:01.440
a paranormal that are mall.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.440
Like bad.

43:03.440 --> 43:05.440
I can't, I can't get out of that one.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.440
What do you think is the worst...

43:07.440 --> 43:09.440
If you, if you, if you don't,

43:09.440 --> 43:11.440
if you don't want to answer, don't,

43:11.440 --> 43:13.440
because I mean...

43:13.440 --> 43:15.440
Oh, you mean the game again where I try not to answer?

43:15.440 --> 43:17.440
No, no, no, no, no.

43:17.440 --> 43:19.440
I'm going into my in-depth interview.

43:19.440 --> 43:21.440
Oh, oh, alright. I'll put on my Larry King answering hat.

43:21.440 --> 43:23.440
What do you think the worst

43:23.440 --> 43:25.440
thing you've ever done?

43:25.440 --> 43:27.440
Oh, the worst thing you've ever done?

43:27.440 --> 43:29.440
Another person? Oh, my God.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.440
One thing comes to mind, but...

43:31.440 --> 43:33.440
It's not that bad, because I had it done back to me.

43:33.440 --> 43:35.440
So does that...

43:35.440 --> 43:37.440
Cancel it out?

43:37.440 --> 43:39.440
I don't know. Is it just a pillow fight or...

43:39.440 --> 43:41.440
Um...

43:41.440 --> 43:43.440
Hey, I want to say...

43:43.440 --> 43:45.440
You gotta tell us about it.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.440
It sucks to admit this, because it's fucked up.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.440
But I was like, I can't remember...

43:49.440 --> 43:51.440
Yeah, there's two things.

43:51.440 --> 43:53.440
What's the worst? Say the worst.

43:53.440 --> 43:55.440
Start with the better one.

43:55.440 --> 43:57.440
Okay, the better one is, like, I...

43:57.440 --> 43:59.440
I peed in a cup, and then I put it in the freezer,

43:59.440 --> 44:01.440
and it was nice and cold,

44:01.440 --> 44:03.440
because I figured coldness will detect...

44:03.440 --> 44:05.440
It won't be able to detect its piss.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.440
Then I mixed it with, like, a little bit of country time.

44:07.440 --> 44:09.440
When you say he, who is the target on this one?

44:09.440 --> 44:11.440
Oh, my cousin. I can't remember what he did to me.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.440
And then I served it to him, just like...

44:13.440 --> 44:15.440
Oh, my God, it's so hot outside.

44:15.440 --> 44:17.440
Dude, have some lemonade.

44:17.440 --> 44:19.440
First of all...

44:19.440 --> 44:21.440
Did you put any lemonade in it, or was it just pee?

44:21.440 --> 44:23.440
I was trying to, like, mask the taste.

44:23.440 --> 44:25.440
So you put, like, powdered country time...

44:25.440 --> 44:27.440
No, no, the kind in the can, I think.

44:27.440 --> 44:29.440
Or the bottle, whatever it was.

44:29.440 --> 44:31.440
You mixed your pee, your refrigerated pee, with lemonade.

44:31.440 --> 44:33.440
What else?

44:33.440 --> 44:35.440
And served it to your cousin on a hot day.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.440
I want a fucking horrible...

44:37.440 --> 44:39.440
I want to hit pause.

44:39.440 --> 44:41.440
Spencer, at what temperature does pee freeze?

44:41.440 --> 44:45.440
Oh, that'd be, uh, 32 degrees Celsius.

44:45.440 --> 44:47.440
Wow, how does it freeze?

44:47.440 --> 44:49.440
Yeah, wow.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.440
I just make all it up. It's just all made up.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.440
I think at the temperature, the pee boils it.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.440
Alright, so what happened with your cousin?

44:55.440 --> 44:57.440
Yeah, I mean, like, I was shocked, first of all,

44:57.440 --> 44:59.440
because I was so scared.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.440
I'm like, he's not just going to accept a glass of lemonade

45:01.440 --> 45:03.440
out of the blue.

45:03.440 --> 45:05.440
I'm just standing right there, like, have some lemonade,

45:05.440 --> 45:07.440
and he's like, wait a minute,

45:07.440 --> 45:09.440
you're giving me lemonade, like, I would be suspicious.

45:09.440 --> 45:11.440
But he was just like, oh, yeah!

45:11.440 --> 45:13.440
He just tried to...

45:13.440 --> 45:17.440
He said, I have this feeling in my mind of, like, success

45:17.440 --> 45:19.440
but failure, because it's like...

45:19.440 --> 45:21.440
You're telling me that if someone offered you

45:21.440 --> 45:23.440
a glass of lemonade,

45:23.440 --> 45:25.440
your first thought would be,

45:25.440 --> 45:27.440
this might be his pee,

45:27.440 --> 45:29.440
and yet...

45:29.440 --> 45:31.440
No one just offers you lemonade.

45:31.440 --> 45:33.440
And yet, when Justin told you famously once

45:33.440 --> 45:35.440
that Lindsay Lohan was coming over

45:35.440 --> 45:37.440
to his apartment so you should clean up

45:37.440 --> 45:39.440
and get a six pack of beer,

45:39.440 --> 45:41.440
you did it.

45:41.440 --> 45:43.440
When was that? I don't remember that.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.440
This is years ago.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.440
But I'm saying, you are famously gullible.

45:47.440 --> 45:49.440
First of all, I've never been that amazed

45:49.440 --> 45:51.440
by Lindsay Lohan, so I question this one.

45:51.440 --> 45:53.440
Well, I don't think that you were like, I'm her biggest fan,

45:53.440 --> 45:55.440
but you were like, she's a celebrity as you clean up.

45:55.440 --> 45:57.440
Maybe it was like Mandy Moore and her Hayden.

45:57.440 --> 45:59.440
You're famously gullible.

45:59.440 --> 46:01.440
Yeah, I know, but I don't...

46:01.440 --> 46:03.440
Well, whatever.

46:03.440 --> 46:05.440
No, but look, see, this is one of those things

46:05.440 --> 46:07.440
where it's a learning lesson,

46:07.440 --> 46:09.440
because you're like, oh man,

46:09.440 --> 46:11.440
I gotta do this just because I can do it.

46:11.440 --> 46:13.440
But then you're like later going like,

46:13.440 --> 46:15.440
what did this serve?

46:15.440 --> 46:17.440
No point.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.440
You didn't tell him, and he didn't notice.

46:19.440 --> 46:21.440
I told him later.

46:21.440 --> 46:23.440
You told him later after he drank the whole thing?

46:23.440 --> 46:25.440
Yeah, he drank the whole thing.

46:25.440 --> 46:27.440
He sucked it down like it was his own piss.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.440
He didn't give a fuck.

46:31.440 --> 46:33.440
And like it was Waterworld.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.440
Right, yeah.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.440
Like Dennis Hopper in Waterworld.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.440
I thought, Abed,

46:39.440 --> 46:41.440
take us through the denouement.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.440
He brings the cup up to his mouth,

46:43.440 --> 46:45.440
and what happens next?

46:45.440 --> 46:47.440
He guzzled down the whole...

46:47.440 --> 46:49.440
He took a couple sips, and then he was...

46:49.440 --> 46:51.440
Like it was his own piss.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.440
He was enjoying it as though

46:53.440 --> 46:55.440
he had just poured himself an ice-cold glass

46:55.440 --> 46:57.440
of his own urine.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.440
I was watching it, and it was like fascination

46:59.440 --> 47:01.440
and horror, because I'm like...

47:01.440 --> 47:03.440
You would have thought it was the guy's own urine

47:03.440 --> 47:05.440
the way he guzzled it.

47:05.440 --> 47:07.440
What?

47:07.440 --> 47:09.440
He didn't detect anything was wrong

47:09.440 --> 47:11.440
with the lemonade?

47:11.440 --> 47:13.440
No, he just drank it a couple times.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.440
How much lemonade? What was the ratio?

47:15.440 --> 47:17.440
It must have been a lot.

47:17.440 --> 47:19.440
He's holding up a solo cup

47:19.440 --> 47:21.440
with like two fingers of...

47:21.440 --> 47:23.440
Two fingers of pee.

47:23.440 --> 47:25.440
I was peeing in a cup.

47:25.440 --> 47:27.440
I was like, Waterworld's gonna be too full.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.440
And then I had to like move the side,

47:29.440 --> 47:31.440
and I got to pee that much.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.440
And then you topped it off.

47:33.440 --> 47:35.440
70% lemonade.

47:35.440 --> 47:37.440
I would say like 70% lemonade.

47:37.440 --> 47:39.440
Just that whisper of...

47:39.440 --> 47:41.440
Whisper of your...

47:41.440 --> 47:43.440
Suggestion of strangers piss.

47:43.440 --> 47:45.440
I would love a lemonade with suggestion of piss.

47:45.440 --> 47:47.440
So he gets through it.

47:47.440 --> 47:49.440
Does he ever go like...

47:49.440 --> 47:51.440
That's terrible lemonade.

47:51.440 --> 47:53.440
No, I think he drinks it,

47:53.440 --> 47:55.440
and because there's like the ratios

47:55.440 --> 47:57.440
over, you know, more lemonade than piss,

47:57.440 --> 47:59.440
he can taste more of the lemonade.

47:59.440 --> 48:01.440
So he's kind of like...

48:01.440 --> 48:03.440
It looks like he's gonna freak out,

48:03.440 --> 48:05.440
but he doesn't.

48:05.440 --> 48:07.440
Because I'm on like pins and needles,

48:07.440 --> 48:09.440
and I'm like...

48:09.440 --> 48:11.440
And then it's like he doesn't know,

48:11.440 --> 48:13.440
and I'm like, you get away with it,

48:13.440 --> 48:15.440
and you're like, fuck.

48:15.440 --> 48:17.440
I feel horrible.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.440
I won, but I don't feel like I won.

48:19.440 --> 48:21.440
I feel like I really did something bad.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.440
Did you ever tell him?

48:23.440 --> 48:25.440
Yeah, no, he didn't...

48:25.440 --> 48:27.440
Nothing happened, and then later I told him,

48:27.440 --> 48:29.440
and then he freaked out.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.440
I didn't ask for the worst thing.

48:31.440 --> 48:33.440
Yeah, but I was like...

48:33.440 --> 48:35.440
And I told him, I was like,

48:35.440 --> 48:37.440
I can't believe you couldn't tell.

48:37.440 --> 48:39.440
Shame on you.

48:39.440 --> 48:41.440
Holy shit, I was waiting for you to figure it out.

48:41.440 --> 48:43.440
You drank that shit?

48:43.440 --> 48:45.440
Is it possible?

48:45.440 --> 48:47.440
Is it possible that your piss is delicious?

48:47.440 --> 48:49.440
That it's not too tart,

48:49.440 --> 48:51.440
not too sweet?

48:51.440 --> 48:53.440
I was like a 12-year-old boy, maybe,

48:53.440 --> 48:55.440
but not now.

48:55.440 --> 48:57.440
I was like ripe,

48:57.440 --> 48:59.440
no alcohol.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.440
I connected

49:01.440 --> 49:03.440
different dots.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.440
The tangy taste

49:05.440 --> 49:07.440
of Flintstones vitamins.

49:07.440 --> 49:09.440
Maybe a little bit of Centrum, too.

49:09.440 --> 49:11.440
Throw it in.

49:11.440 --> 49:13.440
On those crazy weekends,

49:13.440 --> 49:15.440
you're like, I'm gonna have a Centrum, fuck it!

49:15.440 --> 49:17.440
You know?

49:17.440 --> 49:19.440
Your grandpa's away.

49:19.440 --> 49:21.440
Yeah, they're at the park.

49:21.440 --> 49:23.440
Centrum!

49:23.440 --> 49:25.440
And you eat like seven Centrums?

49:25.440 --> 49:27.440
What was it?

49:27.440 --> 49:29.440
Was that worse than the second thing?

49:29.440 --> 49:31.440
Was that worse than the second thing?

49:31.440 --> 49:33.440
Yeah, I think that is worse,

49:33.440 --> 49:35.440
just because when I was doing it,

49:35.440 --> 49:37.440
I was feeling so guilty.

49:37.440 --> 49:39.440
The worst thing is when he peed in his brother's pee.

49:39.440 --> 49:41.440
Because his brother loves to drink his own pee.

49:41.440 --> 49:43.440
It's one thing

49:43.440 --> 49:45.440
to spike country time lemonade, but...

49:45.440 --> 49:47.440
Yeah.

49:47.440 --> 49:49.440
They're gonna know.

49:49.440 --> 49:51.440
Alright, sorry, go ahead.

49:51.440 --> 49:53.440
But this is the one that

49:53.440 --> 49:55.440
came to me later in life,

49:55.440 --> 49:57.440
which deservingly so, I couldn't get mad.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.440
Because I was like, well, I did do that to somebody.

49:59.440 --> 50:01.440
And anyway,

50:01.440 --> 50:03.440
I did this to my brother.

50:03.440 --> 50:05.440
I took, like, cayenne pepper

50:05.440 --> 50:07.440
and I put it in water

50:07.440 --> 50:09.440
and then I put it in a super-soaker.

50:09.440 --> 50:11.440
And then I went up to him and squirted his eyes.

50:11.440 --> 50:13.440
And like...

50:13.440 --> 50:15.440
I think that's worse.

50:15.440 --> 50:17.440
Yeah, that's pretty bad, I know.

50:17.440 --> 50:19.440
And he was like screaming.

50:19.440 --> 50:21.440
I think that's called aggravated assault.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.440
It was so evil and rotten.

50:23.440 --> 50:25.440
And I remember my mom being like,

50:25.440 --> 50:27.440
who are you?

50:27.440 --> 50:29.440
Who does that?

50:29.440 --> 50:31.440
Are you like a Bond supervillain?

50:31.440 --> 50:33.440
You know, like, that's not like you.

50:33.440 --> 50:35.440
You're not evil, you're not manipulative

50:35.440 --> 50:37.440
and crazy.

50:37.440 --> 50:39.440
And I'm like, I don't know.

50:39.440 --> 50:41.440
I mean, sometimes you get mad.

50:41.440 --> 50:43.440
You just gotta strike out.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.440
And then what happened was later in life

50:45.440 --> 50:47.440
I was hanging out with Justin.

50:47.440 --> 50:49.440
And I fell asleep at his house.

50:49.440 --> 50:51.440
And of course, when you hang out with Justin

50:51.440 --> 50:53.440
and he's like, woo-hoo!

50:53.440 --> 50:55.440
In one of his moods, he doesn't want you to fall asleep.

50:55.440 --> 50:57.440
He needs a partner in crime.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.440
So he got so mad that I fell asleep

50:59.440 --> 51:01.440
that he wakes me up and then he just dumps

51:01.440 --> 51:03.440
like water with cayenne pepper in my eyes.

51:03.440 --> 51:05.440
You know, like, just like,

51:05.440 --> 51:07.440
wake up, wake up!

51:07.440 --> 51:09.440
And then like...

51:09.440 --> 51:11.440
Did he do that because he knows that you had done that in the past?

51:11.440 --> 51:13.440
No, no, no. I think I told him later.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.440
Really? Yeah, because I said like, I was like,

51:15.440 --> 51:17.440
you know, I didn't really get that mad

51:17.440 --> 51:19.440
and he was like, he was like, oh, no shit.

51:19.440 --> 51:21.440
And then I told him the story.

51:21.440 --> 51:23.440
And anyway, but what's crazy is like,

51:23.440 --> 51:25.440
I just remember, like, I think I was in a dream

51:25.440 --> 51:27.440
and then I just woke up

51:27.440 --> 51:29.440
to like instant pain and blindness.

51:29.440 --> 51:31.440
If you dump cayenne pepper water

51:31.440 --> 51:33.440
on somebody while they're sleeping, you better be

51:33.440 --> 51:35.440
certain they're not going to murder you afterwards.

51:35.440 --> 51:37.440
No, I was like, I felt it was a nightmare

51:37.440 --> 51:39.440
because I was in so much pain, but I was like,

51:39.440 --> 51:41.440
what's happening? Like, where am I?

51:41.440 --> 51:43.440
I was at a slumber party one time

51:43.440 --> 51:45.440
when a girl stepped on my hand and I just

51:45.440 --> 51:47.440
went to sleep, punched her and knocked her out.

51:47.440 --> 51:49.440
Somebody fucking actually

51:49.440 --> 51:51.440
abused me while I was asleep.

51:51.440 --> 51:53.440
It would be murder. Wait, she just woke you up?

51:53.440 --> 51:55.440
I was sleeping and she was trying to go to the kitchen

51:55.440 --> 51:57.440
in college and people were all laying

51:57.440 --> 51:59.440
all over the floor. Oh yeah, like in 16 candles.

51:59.440 --> 52:01.440
And it was very jammed.

52:01.440 --> 52:03.440
And someone just, she walked

52:03.440 --> 52:05.440
and like stepped on my wrist.

52:05.440 --> 52:07.440
Oh, I hate when that happens.

52:07.440 --> 52:09.440
Bang! It really hurt her.

52:09.440 --> 52:11.440
Did you punch her in the vagina?

52:11.440 --> 52:13.440
You're laying down.

52:13.440 --> 52:15.440
She was kind of crawling and I socked her in the head.

52:15.440 --> 52:17.440
She was crawling. Right in the temple.

52:17.440 --> 52:19.440
You had a dream about a raging bull?

52:19.440 --> 52:21.440
Oh Jesus Christ, what the fuck? I was like, what's happening?

52:21.440 --> 52:23.440
I don't know what's going on. I was silly.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.440
I woke up and somebody's standing above me

52:25.440 --> 52:27.440
laughing, pouring fucking.

52:27.440 --> 52:29.440
It was like King Hippo and then he like,

52:29.440 --> 52:31.440
he like punches him in the dream and he wakes up

52:31.440 --> 52:33.440
and it's like a girl.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.440
I have a big collection of my friends

52:35.440 --> 52:37.440
when they pass out at parties.

52:37.440 --> 52:39.440
I will put things on them.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.440
But it's all stuff, if they wake up, it comes off.

52:41.440 --> 52:43.440
There's like no like in like Sharpie markers.

52:43.440 --> 52:45.440
Yeah, like no fucking can pepper.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.440
I'll put signs on them.

52:47.440 --> 52:49.440
I covered Dan in Post-it notes one time

52:49.440 --> 52:51.440
and you're a little Post-it monster.

52:51.440 --> 52:53.440
Ian Justin once drew like a penis on a girl's face

52:53.440 --> 52:55.440
and that was funny.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.440
Because that's like harmless.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.440
It was with a Sharpie.

52:59.440 --> 53:01.440
The best photo I've ever taken was when Jay Johnson passed out

53:01.440 --> 53:03.440
and I made a duct tape.

53:03.440 --> 53:05.440
I took some duct tape and a Sharpie marker.

53:05.440 --> 53:07.440
I made a mustache.

53:07.440 --> 53:09.440
He had like a nice big handlebar, a mustache made out of duct tape.

53:09.440 --> 53:11.440
And then this girl whose house we're at,

53:11.440 --> 53:13.440
she had playboy bunny ears.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.440
So I put those on his head.

53:15.440 --> 53:17.440
And the amazing thing was you couldn't wake Jay up.

53:17.440 --> 53:19.440
You didn't have to tiptoe around.

53:19.440 --> 53:21.440
You could speak full voice.

53:21.440 --> 53:23.440
I said, Henry, let's play my bunny ears.

53:23.440 --> 53:25.440
We had put a million...

53:25.440 --> 53:27.440
I had him dressed up as an old lady.

53:27.440 --> 53:29.440
He looked like a money python old lady.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.440
And he had like a thousand pieces of clothes on.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.440
He was just never moved a muscle.

53:33.440 --> 53:35.440
And then I made a big sign.

53:35.440 --> 53:37.440
He had the playboy bunny ears on.

53:37.440 --> 53:39.440
And he was like, that's a good racist.

53:39.440 --> 53:41.440
That's amazing.

53:41.440 --> 53:43.440
It's a great picture.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.440
I have that on my phone.

53:45.440 --> 53:47.440
He asked me to remove it from my phone.

53:47.440 --> 53:49.440
I said, but can I keep it?

53:49.440 --> 53:51.440
Because you can keep it, but you can't show it to people.

53:51.440 --> 53:53.440
I have it on my phone.

53:53.440 --> 53:55.440
But I don't show it to anybody.

53:55.440 --> 53:57.440
No.

53:57.440 --> 53:59.440
I mean, maybe you do, but we don't know.

53:59.440 --> 54:01.440
You show it to Jay though, right?

54:01.440 --> 54:03.440
No, I wouldn't. He would pound me into the earth.

54:03.440 --> 54:05.440
If you're on your death bed, it's totally fine.

54:05.440 --> 54:07.440
The reason Jay let me keep it,

54:07.440 --> 54:09.440
because even he agreed it's a very good picture.

54:09.440 --> 54:11.440
Yeah, I mean, it would have been a crime to delete that thing.

54:11.440 --> 54:13.440
If you're about to go on a coma,

54:13.440 --> 54:15.440
you'll be like, dude, before this coma,

54:15.440 --> 54:17.440
you got to see this picture.

54:17.440 --> 54:19.440
Shit.

54:19.440 --> 54:21.440
I got to tell you one thing.

54:21.440 --> 54:23.440
So Justin did that to me,

54:23.440 --> 54:25.440
and then his mom made him feel bad.

54:25.440 --> 54:27.440
Like, he was like fine with it

54:27.440 --> 54:29.440
until she's like, how could you do that to your friend?

54:29.440 --> 54:33.440
I feel like I'm watching a stand-up show on Nickelodeon.

54:33.440 --> 54:35.440
All right.

54:35.440 --> 54:37.440
Well, dude, that's our lives together, man.

54:37.440 --> 54:39.440
I met him, I'm like, man.

54:39.440 --> 54:43.440
You ever sleepin' over at a friend's house?

54:43.440 --> 54:45.440
They do some shit?

54:45.440 --> 54:49.440
Then they mom get mad?

54:49.440 --> 54:51.440
I didn't do nothing.

54:51.440 --> 54:53.440
She's like, what are you doing?

54:53.440 --> 54:55.440
I don't know.

54:55.440 --> 54:57.440
She's not my mom.

54:57.440 --> 54:59.440
We'll be right back.

54:59.440 --> 55:03.440
She didn't kill.

55:03.440 --> 55:05.440
You said three quarters of the n-words.

55:05.440 --> 55:07.440
I know.

55:07.440 --> 55:09.440
Nickelodeon.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.440
Nickelodeon.

55:11.440 --> 55:13.440
Were you doing Nickelodeon?

55:13.440 --> 55:15.440
Is that what he said?

55:15.440 --> 55:17.440
Did I say that or was I repeating

55:17.440 --> 55:19.440
somebody else saying Nickelodeon?

55:19.440 --> 55:21.440
If that's not the title of this episode,

55:21.440 --> 55:23.440
I'll eat my fucking hat.

55:23.440 --> 55:25.440
It better be Nickelodeon.

55:25.440 --> 55:27.440
You don't have to name it that, dude.

55:27.440 --> 55:29.440
Let's all protect ourselves

55:29.440 --> 55:31.440
and make them feel awkward by bringing up

55:31.440 --> 55:33.440
DeMorge Brown!

55:35.440 --> 55:37.440
Do I move down like Letterman?

55:37.440 --> 55:39.440
No, don't move down.

55:39.440 --> 55:41.440
Just behave yourself.

55:41.440 --> 55:43.440
It's so hot in here.

55:47.440 --> 55:49.440
Hello, DeMorge.

55:51.440 --> 55:53.440
Yeah, I brought you up because one time

55:53.440 --> 55:55.440
you substituted for Aaron

55:55.440 --> 55:57.440
when we played D&D and I thought it went quite well.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.440
Oh, thank you very much.

55:59.440 --> 56:01.440
That's what I do.

56:01.440 --> 56:03.440
I sit in the judge.

56:03.440 --> 56:05.440
Who did well in D&D this week?

56:05.440 --> 56:07.440
You're Judge D.

56:07.440 --> 56:09.440
Andy.

56:09.440 --> 56:11.440
I mean, you're going to...

56:11.440 --> 56:13.440
No, I had to get that one out.

56:13.440 --> 56:15.440
Right.

56:15.440 --> 56:17.440
You can't sit on that fucking...

56:17.440 --> 56:19.440
fucking ingot of gold on that one.

56:19.440 --> 56:21.440
It was a two-parter.

56:21.440 --> 56:23.440
Don't keep your light under a pressure.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.440
You're Judge D.

56:25.440 --> 56:27.440
D&D.

56:27.440 --> 56:29.440
You like Judge Judy?

56:29.440 --> 56:31.440
Judge Dredd?

56:31.440 --> 56:33.440
Yeah, Judge Dredd, but he's in a hurry.

56:33.440 --> 56:35.440
He's like, Judge D.

56:35.440 --> 56:37.440
It's the same amount of syllables.

56:39.440 --> 56:41.440
Wow.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.440
Everyone's so fast these days.

56:43.440 --> 56:45.440
They got to zip through words.

56:45.440 --> 56:47.440
What are a couple of old fellas

56:47.440 --> 56:49.440
like I was supposed to do in this room?

56:49.440 --> 56:51.440
I was sitting here pronouncing shit.

56:51.440 --> 56:53.440
I mean, you get old and cranky.

56:53.440 --> 56:55.440
Oh, God. Who knows?

56:55.440 --> 56:57.440
I'll get taken down like a fucking wild deer.

56:57.440 --> 56:59.440
I think you'll be like a crazy...

56:59.440 --> 57:01.440
You'll be like the guy that...

57:01.440 --> 57:03.440
You'll be the get-off-my-lawn guy.

57:03.440 --> 57:05.440
Yeah.

57:05.440 --> 57:07.440
Get-off-my-lawn, you rotten kids.

57:07.440 --> 57:09.440
Jesus.

57:09.440 --> 57:11.440
But not like that.

57:11.440 --> 57:13.440
You'll be for real, you'll be yourself.

57:13.440 --> 57:15.440
You'll be all frantic and you'll be not wanting them on your lawn.

57:15.440 --> 57:17.440
I see him more as a get-on-my-lawn kind of guy.

57:17.440 --> 57:19.440
Just like, kids, get on my lawn!

57:19.440 --> 57:21.440
Don't go by that guy's house.

57:21.440 --> 57:23.440
His house, yeah.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.440
He wants you on his lawn.

57:25.440 --> 57:27.440
Don't go past Old Man Abbot's house.

57:27.440 --> 57:29.440
He'll come out and wash your windshield.

57:29.440 --> 57:31.440
I like that me and DeMorge...

57:31.440 --> 57:33.440
You're probably always out.

57:33.440 --> 57:35.440
You're always out on your front lawn.

57:35.440 --> 57:37.440
I'm always because it's like, man, it's so boring in there.

57:37.440 --> 57:39.440
What's going on out in this world?

57:39.440 --> 57:41.440
Whoa, kids coming by?

57:41.440 --> 57:43.440
Oh, man.

57:43.440 --> 57:45.440
Our Frisbee went over the fence in the Old Man Gates house.

57:45.440 --> 57:47.440
Oh, man, don't go in there.

57:47.440 --> 57:49.440
Did he burn me a CD?

57:51.440 --> 57:53.440
He's like...

57:53.440 --> 57:55.440
It's pretty good, but still...

57:55.440 --> 57:57.440
It took like three hours.

57:57.440 --> 57:59.440
I had to hear about all the track information and it was fucking...

57:59.440 --> 58:01.440
Burned me a CD and then downloaded all of Farscape.

58:01.440 --> 58:03.440
Yeah, yeah.

58:03.440 --> 58:05.440
I'd sit him through like five...

58:05.440 --> 58:07.440
Wait, okay, first five episodes, come on, but we'll get through that.

58:07.440 --> 58:09.440
This is how we met.

58:09.440 --> 58:11.440
You actually gave me Dark Place.

58:11.440 --> 58:13.440
Well, I gave it to Dan,

58:13.440 --> 58:15.440
but you were in the office and you said,

58:15.440 --> 58:17.440
can I take this?

58:17.440 --> 58:19.440
In return, I'll give you Farscape

58:19.440 --> 58:21.440
and I said, I don't know where that is.

58:21.440 --> 58:23.440
And then I lost three months of my life sitting on a couch.

58:23.440 --> 58:25.440
I still need a copy of Dark Place.

58:25.440 --> 58:27.440
I still have the same copy.

58:29.440 --> 58:31.440
That was a copy that Bill Hader gave me.

58:31.440 --> 58:33.440
Oh, really? Yeah.

58:33.440 --> 58:35.440
Wow, that's amazing.

58:35.440 --> 58:37.440
You said, all right, you can borrow it.

58:37.440 --> 58:39.440
And then a year later, you said,

58:39.440 --> 58:41.440
I still have your copy.

58:41.440 --> 58:43.440
It's in the truck.

58:43.440 --> 58:45.440
It was.

58:45.440 --> 58:47.440
Now, time to pass for me.

58:47.440 --> 58:49.440
It's just like...

58:49.440 --> 58:51.440
It's just a regular old podcast.

58:51.440 --> 58:53.440
I have a link in his friends.

58:53.440 --> 58:55.440
Hey, who borrowed my hoe?

58:55.440 --> 58:57.440
I know my garden hoe.

58:57.440 --> 58:59.440
I gave it to you the other day.

58:59.440 --> 59:01.440
Um...

59:01.440 --> 59:03.440
Jamorra, did you say you had a George Takei story?

59:03.440 --> 59:05.440
Barely. It's me and Josh Vadim, actually.

59:05.440 --> 59:07.440
And we went to get sushi in Little Tokyo

59:07.440 --> 59:09.440
at a place called Frying Fish,

59:09.440 --> 59:11.440
which is a carousel.

59:11.440 --> 59:13.440
Yeah, it's a carousel.

59:13.440 --> 59:15.440
What? Give it up for Frying Fish, yo!

59:15.440 --> 59:17.440
That's it.

59:17.440 --> 59:19.440
Jamorra's up here now.

59:19.440 --> 59:21.440
Okay.

59:21.440 --> 59:23.440
But Abed is, too.

59:23.440 --> 59:25.440
Imagine that you did move down the couch.

59:25.440 --> 59:27.440
Oh, like mentally.

59:27.440 --> 59:29.440
Yeah, like mentally move down the couch.

59:29.440 --> 59:31.440
I'm going to watch that happen.

59:31.440 --> 59:33.440
Yeah, no.

59:33.440 --> 59:35.440
Okay, just that.

59:35.440 --> 59:37.440
And we're sitting at two chairs next to each other.

59:37.440 --> 59:39.440
I'm with Josh Vadim.

59:39.440 --> 59:41.440
The stools are very close together.

59:41.440 --> 59:43.440
They're very small, so you can't even keep things in your pocket.

59:43.440 --> 59:45.440
So my phone's out. I know it's out.

59:45.440 --> 59:47.440
And we're well into this sushi thing.

59:47.440 --> 59:49.440
I'm eating some kind of dragon surprise shit.

59:49.440 --> 59:51.440
That's just pee.

59:51.440 --> 59:53.440
Yeah.

59:53.440 --> 59:55.440
But a tiny bit of green tea.

59:55.440 --> 59:57.440
And my phone goes off.

59:57.440 --> 59:59.440
It's a text.

59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.440
I look at it.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.440
It's from Josh,

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.440
who is sitting next to me.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.440
So I furl my brow like this.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.440
And I'm like, this fucking better be good.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.440
And I open it, and it says,

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.440
Sulu.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.440
And I've just been cranking this

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.440
in the second and a half just, what the fuck?

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.440
And I look up, and as I look up,

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.440
I see Takai, and I go,

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.440
Sulu!

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.440
She!

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.440
And he's staring right at us, and then he just smiles.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.440
And goes,

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.440
Can I replicate his laugh?

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.440
It's like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.440
He laughs like the camera.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.440
He's Mr. Magoo?

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.440
No, it's like, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.440
Ah, ah, ah.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.440
He laughs like the camera. It's cool though.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.440
It's cool laugh.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.440
You laugh like that, right?

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.440
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.440
It's like that kind of laugh.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.440
It was that.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.440
What is it that happens to you when you come on stage?

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.440
What?

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.440
Are you thinking like,

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.440
you remind me of Fuzzy Bear.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.440
You said that before.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.440
Sorry, you said that before.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.440
No, you're kind of like,

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.440
the show must go on.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.440
Well, no, I mean,

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.440
he's a showman then.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.440
How does Fuzzy Bear laugh?

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.440
Oh, Kermit!

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.440
Wait, it's like...

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.440
That's all of the family.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.440
That's Edith.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.440
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.440
Ah, Kermit is so funny.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.440
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.440
Ah, it's so funny.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.440
I am so funny.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.440
Will somebody give me a favor online

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.440
when this podcast drops?

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.440
Play that against Fuzzy Bear.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.440
Let's see how accurate that is.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.440
Ah, walk, walk, walk.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.440
That's not a laugh.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.440
Give me some Miss Piggy.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.440
Like, oh, Kermit,

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.440
I really love you.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.440
That's actually quite good.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.440
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.440
Give me some Swedish Chef.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.440
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.440
That was easy, that was easy.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.440
Give me some Roosevelt Franklin.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.440
Which one is he again?

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.440
Zach.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.440
I can do the fish guy.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.440
He's the Franklin of Sesame Street.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.440
I can do the fish guy.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.440
The guy throws fish.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.440
What's his name?

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.440
He's that guy.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.440
Ah, but if I keep you up here...

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.440
Well, look, I'll behave.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.440
I know you're going with this.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.440
I've known you a long time.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.440
I don't know where you're going with this.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.440
I mean, I actually feel like you might be a...

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.440
You might be good playing D&D.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.440
I played before.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.440
He'll be a good Christopher.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.440
He's like a human road flare.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.440
I don't know how to work him.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.440
I read the instructions and I go,

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.440
here's Abbot, and then it's like...

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.440
People are losing eyes and stuff.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.440
And I don't...

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.440
Or it just doesn't work. It just lays there.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.440
Demorge, did you play Mulraine

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.440
or Christopher last time you were here?

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.440
I think you played Mulraine.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.440
I was the unicorn last time I was here.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.440
So you had not played...

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.440
No, Demorge played Mulraine and Sonana.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.440
But now Mulraine is gone.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.440
We can cast whoever as Dignity.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.440
I was the guy last time that sung Lady in Red.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.440
I would have Abbot play Christopher,

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.440
yes, and have Demorge play

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.440
Dignity Sarsgard.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.440
Dignity Sarsgard.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.440
Dignity means...

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.440
Aaron committed seppuku last time

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.440
and re-emerged as a new character

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.440
and she has a different name.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.440
She didn't lose a step.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.440
No.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.440
Well, unicorns...

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.440
Come style stop.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.440
Don't stop.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.440
Whenever you hesitate,

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.440
hit the gas pedal.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.440
Oh, man!

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.440
I was watching Seinfeld.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.440
I need an opposite George kind of thing.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.440
Because that would help me out.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.440
I don't ever fucking balk up here.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.440
I want you to fucking throw high and hard.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.440
I mean, unicorns like...

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.440
They kind of...

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.440
They have more than a step. They have sort of a glide.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.440
I suppose, yeah.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.440
It's like, you know that...

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.440
It's like you see them glide and then rainbow

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.440
sprinkles come from behind their hubs kind of thing.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.440
That's how they move.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.440
Is there anything...

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.440
I was listening to some podcast.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.440
It was people talking about all the things that they...

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.440
They were personally

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.440
humiliated to find out.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.440
They didn't know until they were

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.440
much too old.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.440
One of the examples that that reminded me of

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.440
is there's a girl who was telling a story

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.440
of how she thought that unicorns

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.440
were real animals until she was like

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.440
30 at a party.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.440
And it was like at a party and people were talking

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.440
about endangered animals and she

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.440
piped in with like,

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.440
what about unicorns? Are they endangered?

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.440
And found out then

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.440
that she just thought that...

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.440
I so wish I was there.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.440
That's awesome. But you know what?

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.440
She had the best 30 years of anyone's life.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.440
Well, that's... Yeah, that's a thing.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.440
There's a lot of people, yeah, like, well, I mean,

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.440
I can't remember what the other examples were.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.440
She didn't spend any of those 30 years seeking one out.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.440
Like going to find...

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.440
Where would you see one?

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.440
She just figured that they were in Africa or something.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.440
I don't know. I don't know where she thought they were.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.440
But...

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.440
I went to school with a girl who...

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.440
She was a new student when I was in ninth grade,

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.440
I think, or eighth grade, ninth grade.

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.440
Who failed her first exam

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:17.440
because she was convinced

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.440
she had been taught,

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.440
as her parents angrily stated later,

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.440
that the South had won the war.

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.440
Whoa!

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.440
She'd gone to an academy and they brought in

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.440
her work and it was just a book

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.440
that had rationalized the whole thing and had created

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.440
this whole... This is where she had gone to school.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.440
That's like evil Santa Claus line, you know?

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.440
One step, one step.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.440
The Santa Claus is bad, but that's fucking worse.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.440
Wait.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.440
Abed, go on.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.440
I was like...

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.440
You lied to a kid about Santa Claus.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.440
We were talking about this.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.440
We were, yeah.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.440
But with you lying about that shit,

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.440
that's like fucking with a kid's sense of history.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.440
That's bullshit.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.440
I don't get the impression that they told

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.440
the kid the South won the war

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.440
so that they would think that they were living

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.440
in a better world.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.440
I think they...

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.440
Is that what it was?

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.440
She took this exam.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.440
Later, take the test because she'd gotten there

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.440
on a Tuesday or something, the test was on Friday.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.440
So just to be part of the school.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.440
And a lot of it was blue book stuff.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.440
And I guess the teacher kind of

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.440
was frazzled, lost his head over the whole thing.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.440
And on Monday, she said,

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.440
I can't even give you a grade on this so you fail.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.440
Because what are you even thinking?

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.440
These opinions don't...

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:33.440
Everything you have written is insane.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.440
And she was in tears and went crazy.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.440
Her parents came in to match for this conference

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.440
and they went step by step

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.440
trying to explain that in their education

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.440
this is what...

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.440
It goes back.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.440
She had a book, like the text

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.440
that she had used when she learned

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.440
the history of the United States.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.440
Editorially rationalized

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.440
this sort of conclusion

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.440
that that was why the flag was still

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.440
flown down there and that is why.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.440
Her alphabet had three K's.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.440
Her spelling books were like,

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.440
they showed black people as slaves still.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.440
It was insane.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.440
And so the parents

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.440
apparently, and I know this from teachers,

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.440
I was on student council, that apparently

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.440
the parents argument was that's

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.440
upper debate. It depends on how you define

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.440
the one. What is winning?

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.440
Had to be there, had to be there.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.440
Well, that's the point

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.440
where it starts to actually get fascinated

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.440
because it's like, yeah, what the fuck, what is it?

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.440
I think unconditional surrender

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.440
of your army and your ability to be more.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.440
They signed a surrender document, didn't they?

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.440
Yeah, they signed a whole document.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.440
Yes, but we're talking about

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.440
two parents who are saying this is why

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.440
the flag is still

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.440
flown on our porch down here.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.440
And they're saying we don't acknowledge

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.440
that surrender document.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.440
Why isn't there like a flag cop that shows up and he's like,

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.440
so you got the wrong flag,

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.440
you would take that, this is the right one.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.440
Why isn't he doing his job?

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.440
Then they sent her

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:05.440
back in an all new flag cop. Check it out, Friday.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.440
That decision is made at the state level.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.440
What would the pilot

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.440
for flag cop be?

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.440
The pilot?

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.440
We're a studio, you're pitching us

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.440
your show flag cop.

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:19.440
I mean, flag cop,

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.440
it's like the first episode is like...

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.440
Who is flag cop?

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:25.440
He's a cop who has to see if people

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.440
have the right flag or not.

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.440
Don't take some in.

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.440
The pilot's like the first episode is like

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.440
his best friend from my childhood.

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.440
Still, like he said, was raised

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.440
thinking the South really happened.

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.440
South won the war.

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:41.440
It's still happening, baby.

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.440
Flag cop is torn between two sides.

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.440
South is still happening.

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.440
But he goes against everything I believe.

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.440
What do I do?

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.440
What's the season finale

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.440
of flag cop?

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.440
Where he finds out

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.440
that he was brainwashed as a kid

01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.440
and that he actually does believe in the other flag?

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.440
So he has to like think.

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.440
Like everything I've been taught is a lie.

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.440
And then you're like, next season,

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.440
was it really a lie

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.440
or was he tricked into thinking that?

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.440
Sounds about as good

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.440
as most TV these days.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.440
He didn't give me much to work with.

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.440
He gave me flag cop.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.440
I could see this on Netflix.

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.440
Could flag cop be into different flags?

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.440
Or is it only about the North and the South?

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.440
Well, like in season two,

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.440
we go, well,

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.440
the flag is kind of like cool,

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.440
but I like that design in the Brazil flag.

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.440
It looks like a cool globe.

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:35.440
It's all blue with stars.

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.440
And so he's like, he falls in love with this Brazilian girl

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.440
that's like, she's really

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.440
working for Brazil to kind of trick him,

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.440
but he doesn't know that.

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.440
So the whole season you think, oh, he just found a girlfriend,

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.440
but like, she's really against him.

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.440
And in the last episode, we're like,

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.440
That sounds better than most TV.

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.440
It's probably

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.440
season is Confederate versus US flag,

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.440
and it's like a really popular show,

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.440
really critically lauded.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.440
And then second season, they do like

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.440
the wire doing the stevedores, you know.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.440
He's right, he's right.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.440
The wire could be about any kind of wire.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.440
And then third season,

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.440
they're like, okay, yeah, but seriously,

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.440
how about those crack dealers?

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.440
So then third season, we go back

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.440
to his roots, like who taught him

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.440
about flags.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.440
When does the movie come out?

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.440
We're gonna be like season five.

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.440
There's a cool, like Emmy

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.440
nominated episode

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.440
where he's having a talk

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.440
to create his medication, and he meets

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.440
Betsy Ross.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.440
Well, it's like Betsy Ross

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.440
in his great-great-grandfather

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.440
dating, you see.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.440
So like, his great-great-great-grandfather

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.440
was like her first lover, but then

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.440
she dumped him for George Washington.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.440
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.440
Fuck, me and my history

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.440
don't apologize, I mean.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.440
Anyway, Betsy Ross and him almost hooked up,

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.440
but then she like dumped him for this

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.440
like, Bronn Bones, you know,

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.440
CB Hollow guy that's like,

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.440
and he like, wins her over.

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.440
What does Flag Cop think of those parking lot guys

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.440
that are just waving orange flags?

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.440
No loyalty.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.440
It's crazy like seizure where he's like,

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.440
they don't understand.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.440
I mean like, goes into a seizure of like,

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.440
you know, like yeah, it's like it's kryptonite.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.440
He can't see flags.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.440
Yeah, because he sees a flag trapped.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.440
You know, like it's like, oh, I gotta free that flag.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.440
Is there a whole flag department,

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.440
police department?

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.440
Is he just one cop among many flag cops?

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.440
No, he's like the laughing stock

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.440
of his department, because everyone's like,

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.440
you're just investigating flags, man.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.440
I don't know what it's like out there.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.440
Hey cop, he's like, hey, look.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.440
He goes down with flags too.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.440
Catch any flags today?

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.440
Hey, hey, Murphy.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.440
Murphy, here comes Flag Cop.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:47.440
Hey, look.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.440
My flag is billowing too much in the wind.

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.440
You want to fucking do something about that?

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.440
That's the pilot is the guys

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.440
that get made fun of like that.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.440
And then a fucking senator is killed with a flag.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.440
And the homicide department's like,

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.440
fuck.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.440
We have no...

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.440
I want these departments working together on this one.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.440
This is a flag crime and a homicide.

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.440
It's finally Flag Cop's moment.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.440
And he's like, I've been waiting for this my whole career.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.440
Which flag was it?

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.440
I don't know, I see some stars.

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.440
That's not specific enough.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:21.440
There's stars in a million flags.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.440
The knot's too tight.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.440
Well, don't touch it. There's evidence on it.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.440
And the whole thing's about untying that knot.

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.440
You're untying the flag the whole season.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.440
Don't let it touch the ground.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.440
Yeah, you can't let it touch the ground either.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.440
It might be an American flag.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.440
He knows where it's been.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.440
There's a bad guy who lives on a mountain.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.440
He has a flag and he's slowly lowering it

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.440
towards the ground.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.440
If you don't get there,

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.440
by the time the flag touches the ground,

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.440
he'll murder somebody.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.440
No, he won't murder somebody.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.440
He keeps murdering people until you make him.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.440
The reason they come up there,

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.440
because the flag is going to touch the ground by season.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.440
He wants the flag to touch the ground?

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.440
The bad guy's lowering it to the ground.

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.440
And Flag Cop has to keep it from touching the ground.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.440
I don't know what the stakes are.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.440
I just know.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.440
Because you open the episode with

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.440
Flag Cop like raising a flag,

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.440
and it's like he knows the time

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.440
of when a flag has to hit the top and the bottom.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.440
Yeah.

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.440
It's like 24.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.440
It's a ticking clock thing.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.440
It doesn't count down

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.440
to a flag touching the ground.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.440
How much time do they have to save all the hostage?

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:31.440
He has to go through a series of puzzles

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.440
to get to the place before.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.440
Can Christo play that guy?

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.440
I was just going to ask who's playing flag.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.440
There's a flag cop out there.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.440
Oh, flag cop?

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.440
A flag cop?

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.440
I blurted that out.

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.440
I can't top that.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.440
Can we get Fitty to play flag cop?

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.440
Oh, Fitty would be perfect.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.440
I just want to see him in more stuff,

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.440
but I don't know if he's right for the part.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.440
We could probably...

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.440
As long as I.S.T. plays the commissioner.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.440
Flag cop, you fucked up again!

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.440
Shit!

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.440
Fool, you fucked up again, flag cop!

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.440
Shit!

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.440
Get in my office!

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.440
I've never seen anybody

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.440
earn so few stripes

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.440
protecting stripes.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.440
The irony...

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.440
Flag cop, get the fuck out of here!

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.440
Go do your job!

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.440
Flag cop, shit!

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.440
What, am I here for my health?

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.440
God damn it!

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.440
And then halfway through the season at the vending machine?

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.440
You have to play Fitty for this.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.440
He'll be I.S.T. and you're Fitty.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.440
You're flag cop.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.440
At the vending machine,

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.440
I'm just describing an event that happens.

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.440
At the vending machine,

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.440
I.S.T. has been riding the guy

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.440
for the whole season.

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.440
He's always riding him.

01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.440
And then he's putting some money

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.440
in the vending machine

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.440
and he drops his wallet.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.440
And an old I.D. falls out

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.440
revealing that I.S.T.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.440
when he got started was on the flag

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.440
department.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.440
That's why I ride you so hard.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.440
Because I know you can do better.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.440
That's brilliant, that's brilliant.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.440
I love it, I love it.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.440
And you gotta work twice as hard

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.440
when you're a flag cop.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.440
Because all people see is a fucking flag cop.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.440
Doesn't matter how good you are.

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.440
Shit, Miranda rights,

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.440
due process,

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.440
quotas, you can fuck all that.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.440
Flag cop.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.440
Sorry, I thought that was a theme song.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.440
There's an alarm going off at Flag Cop Central.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.440
Flag cop.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.440
You better take care of that, boss, fuck.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.440
You bet your ass you better take care of it.

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.440
Yo, am I going to get a raise though?

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.440
For real, I've been working so hard.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.440
Man, the only thing that gets raised around here

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.440
are flags, get the fuck out of here.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.440
Don't do your job.

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:17.440
Alright Spencer, let's play some D&D, shall we?

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.440
Dan, if you were to...

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.440
Flag cop, really?

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.440
That's a show?

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:27.440
Flag cop should be a show?

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.440
I would see the ad for it and be like,

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.440
that's a show?

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.440
Flag cop?

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.440
Channel 101 show.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.440
If Homeland can be in its sixth season.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.440
I haven't even watched it.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.440
That show, terrorist senator.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.440
That's basically 24, just from a different angle.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.440
Alright, you're Christopher.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.440
Do I give you this?

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.440
Pass it down.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.440
Keep your character and pass the others down.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.440
Of course.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.440
Where am I?

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.440
These are all three pages, these are all dignity?

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.440
Alright, let me see it.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.440
It's okay.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.440
This is Quark, and he's only one page,

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.440
so I assume one of those pages is okay.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.440
That's Quark.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.440
Passes all the way down to Jeff.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.440
We can edit this part out later, maybe?

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.440
I hope so.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.440
If you're listening at home, get up,

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.440
make yourself a nice cold beverage.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.440
The show brought to you by Pee.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.440
Who doesn't like a nice,

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.440
distracting lemonade Pee?

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.440
Are you in the bathroom and you're wondering,

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.440
how do I get that?

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.440
Country time Pee tastes just like you, or Pee.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.440
I never took an abyss and wondered,

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.440
I want that in my body.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.440
How do I do that?

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.440
Country time.

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.440
Alright, are we good to go?

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.440
Doctor, take us on a magic voyage.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.440
Okay.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.440
Last time on Harmontown,

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.440
our heroes were safe for the moment.

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.440
After losing Mulraine in combat

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.440
and taking refuge from Admiral Darkstar,

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.440
Darkstar,

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.440
in the Town of Rose Book,

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.440
our heroes rested in the constabulary

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.440
with their new friend,

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.440
Dignity the Paladin.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.440
Our heroes went

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.440
to inspect the magical barrier

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.440
defending the town and ran into

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.440
Father Tinder, who was handing out

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.440
juice to everyone.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.440
After a great internal turmoil,

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.440
debate and many skill-chain checks,

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.440
our gang decided the juice was safe

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:25.440
and drank the delicious juice.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.440
They were

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.440
so enamored by the juice

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.440
that they demanded to see the juicery

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.440
where it was made.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.440
Father Tinder took the gang to the juicery,

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.440
but outside was a drunken knight

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.440
named Darmvan.

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.440
The drunk accused the Father Tinder

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:43.440
of putting the entire village

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.440
in danger

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.440
and attacked, but as Chris de Burgh

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.440
moved to intervene, the drunken knight

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.440
fell on his own blade,

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.440
impaling himself.

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.440
But what did Darmvan mean with his strange words?

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.440
What secrets

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.440
did the juicery hold?

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.440
Why is everyone

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.440
so interested in juice?

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.440
What the fuck is going on

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.440
to my left?

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.440
Find out on an all-new episode

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.440
of Harmontown Time.

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.440
Sorry, man, we were like distracted

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.440
by the big guys. No, no, it's cool.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.440
I just can't see, because Dan's in the way,

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.440
but very clearly something insane

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:27.440
is going on.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.440
It's just the big hunk-ice is what I'm hearing.

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.440
You're in a hunk of guys. I don't know.

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.440
That's not interesting at all, really.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.440
This also is not interesting,

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.440
but there's no easy way to make people

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.440
drinks up here.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.440
Usually it's not a problem, because

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.440
we don't usually have drinkers up here.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.440
I'm suddenly not complaining.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.440
I just couldn't see at all.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.440
But we should have a pill

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.440
that makes your fingernails stop growing,

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.440
and we should have a little dispenser up here

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.440
that you could just...

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.440
Like in a big robot that's like,

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.440
you want drinks, here you go.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.440
Just get a bartender.

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:03.440
If you're holding, you've got to have a robot,

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.440
because a robot doesn't care if you...

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.440
If we just kick him around a bit,

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.440
we'll pay the guy.

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.440
Hey, you dumb robot, give me a drink.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.440
Every night, we could

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.440
put up like 50 bucks,

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.440
and we'll have somebody from the...

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.440
There'll be a number under someone's seat.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.440
50 bucks? Where would they stand?

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.440
Over here, or maybe over here,

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.440
in the 10 bar.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.440
I'll do it for 50 bucks.

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:29.440
I'll do it for 50 bucks.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.440
I know you would,

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.440
but it would also be interesting,

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:35.440
to have a random person from the audience

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.440
each week bartender.

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.440
No, it's too low.

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:41.440
No, you low-balled it.

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.440
100.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.440
Let's try next week,

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.440
$100 surprise bartender.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.440
I like it.

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.440
We'll put the bucket over here,

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.440
and if we snap our fingers,

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.440
they're getting paid to come bring us drinks.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:57.440
We'll mic them up

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.440
and throw one over there, Tony,

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.440
and then Tony can go,

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.440
my name's Alice.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.440
We're talking a higher bit ratio.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.440
You're going to get two more bits each show.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.440
From the time you make the drinks,

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.440
you get more bits.

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.440
I think every week,

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.440
we find a different way to select,

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.440
like it'll be some

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.440
whose driver's license number

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:21.440
ends with a thing, or I don't know,

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.440
we'll find a way to select somebody.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.440
Well, I will change my driver's license.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.440
Dan, just give Abad $100.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.440
I'm just joking.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.440
I'm having fun.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.440
I keep thinking about the thought experiment

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.440
of taking Abad, Gaith,

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.440
and Steve Brody

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.440
up to an elevator

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:41.440
on the top floor of a really tall building

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.440
and putting them both in it,

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.440
and pressing the lobby button,

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.440
and then running down and just waiting

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.440
to see what's going on in that elevator.

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:51.440
Steve Brody?

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.440
Brody Stevens.

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.440
Yes.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.440
I know him.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.440
You got it.

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.440
I think if Brody Stevens

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.440
and Abad touched fingers,

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.440
they would create a singularity.

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.440
You should have stand up.

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.440
Steve Brody.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.440
I used to do stand up with Brody Stevens.

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.440
I know him.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.440
I have photographs of that.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.440
We were all distracted.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.440
I'm sorry, doing your eloquent soliloquy there.

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.440
There was an ice situation, I think.

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.440
You guys,

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.440
you were outside the juicery

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.440
after having ingested this lovely juice.

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.440
Right.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.440
And Darvon the Knight, he had came up

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.440
and he was like,

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:35.440
you guys, you fucking guys,

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.440
you're going to kill us all.

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.440
We're all dead.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.440
And then he attacked,

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.440
and he fell on his own blade.

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.440
And that just happened.

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.440
And then you guys were all like,

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.440
we're still excited about juice.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.440
I get down by

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.440
Darvon's head,

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.440
like they do in the movies when someone's dying.

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.440
Darvon.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.440
In case he's got some extra words

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:01.440
to squeeze out.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.440
He's like, you got to stop

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.440
him.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:07.440
We'll all die.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.440
Is that Darvon?

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.440
Yeah. Is he talking about Father Tinder, you think?

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.440
Or Admiral Darkstar.

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.440
Oh, by the way, while that's happening,

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.440
I loot him.

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.440
You're going to loot the man while he's dying?

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.440
I'm fucking, I'm

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:23.440
looting everybody that dies.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.440
Father Tinder's like, hey man, that's fucked up.

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.440
There's like, you know...

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.440
Yeah, don't die.

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.440
There's what do you call them, estates and shit?

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.440
There's laws, like...

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.440
Oh, Father Tinder's standing right there?

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.440
Yeah, he's all here.

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.440
I take it out, I just put it on the ground and go,

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.440
this guy's got lots of shit.

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.440
Oh yeah, but I mean, that's got to go to his family.

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:45.440
Okay, well, I take inventory of what he's got.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:47.440
Five gold pieces.

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.440
One belt buckle.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.440
Three torches.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.440
One sword.

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:55.440
A half-plate mail suit of armor.

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.440
That's all.

01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.440
Dibs on the buckle.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.440
My pants are falling down.

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:03.440
I think we're going to play it cool here.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:05.440
Father Tinder, why was this guy so irate

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.440
and accusing you of horrible things?

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.440
Well, we all just saw it.

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.440
Don't you remember?

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.440
That literally happened seconds ago.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:17.440
I said, why do you think he would be doing that?

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.440
Oh, I know why.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.440
He was possessed by the demon of alcohol.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.440
The second the alcohol reached his lips,

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:25.440
he was already dead.

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.440
Woo!

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:29.440
Sounded like someone spiked his punch.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.440
Could I, as a paladin,

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.440
name Dignity,

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.440
could I perhaps

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:37.440
pull out

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.440
my ability to smite evil

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.440
two times per day?

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.440
Tonight, the role of Dignity's guard

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.440
will be played by President Barack Obama.

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.440
Yeah, what evil do you want to smite, though?

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.440
Well, I'm assuming the father's got

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:55.440
some sort of darkness in him.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.440
Must not sleep between the two,

01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.440
or is it just general evil?

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.440
As it happens, you're a paladin,

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.440
and you can detect evil,

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.440
yet you detect no evil among him,

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.440
and you get the feeling if you tried to smite his evil,

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.440
it wouldn't smite.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.440
If you tried to smite his evil,

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.440
it wouldn't smite him, evil.

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.440
Guys, why don't we just take a tour

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.440
of that juice factory,

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:19.440
like, where we're gonna...awful to see a guy die?

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.440
Yeah, I would like some free samples.

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:23.440
Now, I mean,

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.440
I don't want to be rude.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.440
I enjoy juice about as...

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.440
I mean, a lot more than the next guy.

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:31.440
But, it's getting late.

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.440
A man just died.

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.440
I have to go inform his wife and kids.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:37.440
There's an angel demon

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.440
beating down our magical barrier.

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.440
Maybe we should just, you know, turn in for the night.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.440
You know what? I'm on for the juice tour.

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.440
You know what?

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.440
You know what we should do to cover more ground?

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:49.440
You tend to the city's more dire business,

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.440
given a civic emergency,

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.440
and we will volunteer

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.440
to go report the bad news

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.440
to Darvon's wife.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.440
And they will, like, do a juice tour on the side?

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:01.440
Yes.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.440
Maybe just

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.440
tour the juicery tomorrow.

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:07.440
I mean, I'll take you there. It'll be great.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:09.440
No, it'll be different tomorrow.

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.440
Maybe I won't want to do it tomorrow.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.440
Father Tender, are these soul rods holding up?

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.440
Like, is this force field going to last much longer?

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.440
Oh, yeah. It'll last forever.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.440
As long as God's favor is on our side

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.440
and no one drinks the demonic alcohol.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.440
Is there a difference between the juice and the alcohol?

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:25.440
Juice is juice. Alcohol is evil.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.440
Juice is juice.

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:29.440
Did he know he was drinking

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.440
demonic alcohol?

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.440
All the alcohol.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.440
All the alcohol is demonic.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.440
He knew what he was doing.

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.440
Oh, so he's just a drunk.

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.440
Are we in the presence of any alcohol at this time?

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.440
No, no.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.440
Not the way I see it.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.440
Just wholesome juice.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:49.440
Wholesome juice.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.440
We'll go tell his wife about his death

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.440
and you go do

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.440
city things.

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.440
I think I'd just go to bed, I guess, really.

01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.440
Well, I mean, wait a second.

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:01.440
Turn some library books or something?

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.440
No, no.

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.440
Where are we going to sleep tonight, Father Tinder?

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.440
Is there a hotel or a hostel for us?

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.440
You know, you could go...

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.440
Didn't you want to go tell the towns?

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.440
Whatever. Let me answer your question.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.440
There's extra beds.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.440
We will take on thy duties.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:19.440
I mean, we'll do it.

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.440
And then you can attain

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.440
to your previous...

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.440
Stop.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.440
Sorry, I was trying to help myself.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.440
You might have to forgive

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.440
Father Tinder's loquaciousness.

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.440
If we could, perhaps,

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.440
find the wife

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.440
and you can accompany us

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.440
what I'd like to do

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.440
at this time, though.

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.440
I have a horse, if I can mount the steed

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.440
and I'll ride

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.440
the caboose on this train

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:49.440
and I'll put you in front of me and keep my eyes on you.

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.440
Well, I mean,

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:53.440
I can go tell the wife and kids

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.440
and you don't have to come

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.440
or you guys can go do it and I don't have to come.

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.440
We all do it together.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.440
But you seem reluctant to let us do it.

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.440
I'm just in the bedchamber.

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.440
I'm going to change courses here.

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:07.440
I'm going to backtrack. Let's go together.

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.440
Let's take a nice nap in the bedchamber.

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.440
I feel like we should go and you should go to sleep.

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.440
You need your rest.

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.440
You can stay here and bury the body.

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.440
Well, yeah, I mean, speaking of which,

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.440
he puts his fingers to his mouth

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.440
and he whistles and two guards

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.440
show up in red and white uniforms

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.440
and they're all like, what's all this then?

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.440
And he's like, this man, he attacked us.

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:29.440
He killed himself, basically.

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.440
And they're like, oh, okay.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.440
And they start hauling the body off.

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.440
That's it.

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.440
Well, that's the end of that, then.

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.440
Is that for nothing?

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.440
Well, now let's continue talking.

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.440
You want beds, I think, right?

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.440
I'm tired. It's been a long day.

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.440
I can take a sneeze.

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:49.440
As I said, there's extra beds in the constabulary

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.440
if you'd like to rest.

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.440
Is that another made-up word?

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.440
It's like a police station.

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.440
All right.

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.440
We'll go to the constabulary and rest.

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.440
Sounds like you get stabbed there.

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.440
Well, you might.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.440
Yeah, I'm not feeling this constabulary.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.440
Fellows, can I say that?

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.440
That's just a joke.

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.440
It's a little like stabalicious.

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.440
Let's just go to the constabulary and get some sleep.

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.440
Let's go sleep at the constabulary.

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.440
And then in the morning...

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.440
In the morning, we'll go over to Darnvon's wife's house,

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.440
which is what district again?

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.440
Well, if you don't want to do it tonight,

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.440
that's not a big deal,

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.440
but I just feel like it should be done tonight.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.440
I'll do it. It's fine.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.440
I'll do it. Well, you guys are...

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:37.440
Will somebody do it? Yeah, someone do it now.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.440
I'll do it. I'll do it.

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.440
Let me do it. Where does she live?

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:43.440
She lives over on Reading Street.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:45.440
I'm going to Reading Street.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.440
I go with him.

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.440
I'm going to hang back.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.440
Yeah, I'll hang back.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.440
I'm going to go home.

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.440
All right.

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.440
Why don't you guys go dig up what you can dig up

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.440
at the constabulary?

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:01.440
We'll find some stabbing.

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.440
Quark and I are going to go check out

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.440
this guy's wife.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:09.440
I feel like it's high school

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.440
and I was told to go somewhere

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.440
so that someone else could fuck.

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.440
That's not...

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:17.440
We're not going to fuck his wife.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.440
All right, check out his wife also

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.440
means, like, look at her.

01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.440
But I'm just saying,

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.440
we'll cover more ground. It's an investigation.

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.440
I think that there's strange things

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.440
afoot in this town. It's all sealed off.

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.440
This guy's crazy about juice.

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.440
The guy was saying

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:35.440
he's going to kill everybody

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:37.440
and then he falls on his own sword.

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.440
I saw him roll the 1, too. That wasn't supposed to happen.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.440
When that guy fell on his sword, he rolled a 1.

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.440
Yeah.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.440
We go up Reading Street

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.440
to the gals.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.440
Yeah, you do that.

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.440
You do that as Father Tender departs.

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:55.440
You get to Reading Street

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.440
and you see a small house that must be it.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.440
It's a cylindrical house

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.440
with a small conical roof.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.440
Yeah.

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:05.440
That looks like it.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.440
A cylindrical house.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.440
A conical roof.

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.440
They say it looks like a dick kind of.

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.440
And that's what they said.

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.440
Yeah, it's a pre-address society.

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.440
All right.

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.440
I knock on the door.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.440
What time of day is it, by the way?

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.440
It's really late. It's probably like 11 or 12.

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.440
Well, it's kind of early.

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.440
I don't know.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.440
Sure. I mean, at night, though.

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:31.440
Oh.

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.440
Sorry.

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:35.440
Knock, knock, knock.

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.440
Hello.

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.440
Hello.

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:41.440
Mrs. Darmfond?

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:43.440
She opens the door.

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.440
She's like, yes.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.440
We have terrible news for you.

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.440
Your husband in the commission

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.440
of his duties to protect the city

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.440
figuratively and literally

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.440
fell on his own sword.

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.440
And

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.440
he's

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.440
he's no longer with us.

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:13.440
I hand her

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.440
his belt buckle that I took from the pile.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.440
You took the belt buckle?

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:21.440
Just to verify our story.

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.440
I also have the gold coins, too.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.440
Her eyes well up with tears

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:31.440
and she's like, oh, I

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.440
knew this might happen.

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.440
He was talking about it

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.440
in the past few days.

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.440
Mrs. Darmfond, before you continue,

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.440
could my partner and I come

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.440
into your home

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.440
so that this conversation could happen in private?

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.440
I mean, I don't really know

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.440
who you guys are. That seems a bit...

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:51.440
It seems to me, Mrs. Darmfond,

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:53.440
from the way things are going around here,

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:55.440
that us being strangers means

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.440
you can trust us the most.

01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.440
All right.

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.440
Come in.

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:03.440
I'll put the kettle on.

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.440
Just don't put any juice in it.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:07.440
Now, Mrs. Darmfond,

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.440
you're saying that he was talking about

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:11.440
what over the last couple of days?

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.440
He was talking about how Father Tinder

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.440
had a magic power

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:17.440
that made him untouchable by anyone.

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.440
You couldn't even try to kill him

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:21.440
if you wanted to.

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:23.440
Why would somebody want to kill Father Tinder?

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.440
Oh, because that power that he has,

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.440
it's highly sought after

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.440
and not, you know,

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.440
not uncommonly.

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:34.440
In fact, I would say it's a common occurrence.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.440
People, enemies,

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.440
malifactors, and sometimes dangerous

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.440
and more dangerous creatures

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.440
come to the city to try and

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:44.440
regain control of this

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.440
power that he possesses.

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.440
I pull Sharpie aside.

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:50.440
Do you think he has one of those magical shards,

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.440
those power crystal-thingy shards?

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.440
Did you ever hear anyone say anything about

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.440
a shard of something or other,

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.440
or a power of something,

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.440
or a something of power, or a shard of something?

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.440
The only thing Darvon ever talked about

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.440
was how the scriptures mentioned

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.440
something about holy stones.

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:08.440
Oh.

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.440
Cut to Ovard and Dimorgia

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.440
for the constabulary.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.440
Hey, is this a big detail?

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:18.440
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.440
I think there's an echo in this constabulary.

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.440
Echo, echo, echo.

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.440
Uh, what?

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:26.440
Is there anyone there

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.440
to show us to our

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:32.420
accommodations well so you guys are outside you're walking towards the

01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:38.520
accommodations but then up rolls a gnome in a small wooden wheeled chair he's a

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:45.120

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:14.320

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:15.600

information maybe do you do you have for I'm just feeling a lot better I'm

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:27.560
able to roll around in a wheelchair now you know all these healing sessions

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:31.080
they're working it's great this place fucked up though you shouldn't trust

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:37.280
anyone around here I don't I don't say with a name like constabulary speaking

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:41.760
of obviously you shouldn't stay at the constabulary tonight it's real it's

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:45.360
gonna be real dangerous I mean I got a tower you know not that I don't trust

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:50.640
him because he's a little guy with a cart but I feel like you should probably

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:56.520
bail hang out with our homies over at the where they at with some girl you know

01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:01.720
she's like a prom queen or something well there well that sounds great let's

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:05.880
go do that then yeah let's do that I mean like here's what we're gonna do with this

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:19.160
guy it's been great sir and and your notes are duly noted by us what we're

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:24.360
gonna do is is take a different tack on this we won't reveal it to you

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.840
heeding your words of not trusting anybody but honestly we're going somewhere

01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:33.560
else thank thanks it's really nicely decorated but I mean come on I mean

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:37.600
once you saw my constabulary that's I'm trying to

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:42.080
I'm just saying you're kind of like the host why don't we just move on and head

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:49.440
so we go like we gotta remove to remove to reading street yeah no let's move I'll

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:54.800
give you a little advice I want to like if I can drag my friend away sir yeah

01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:01.160
let's go let's go over the cart so I think he was walking you know there are

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.840
two types of rhetoric in this world in every movement there's a rhetoric of

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:11.360
convergence and a rhetoric of agitation he's the guy with the words I just hang

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:17.040
out so we're on our way we're on our way to the house we're gonna rejoin well

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:21.120
you guys should come back to my tower to get sleep and not sleep in these beds

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:24.320
when you guys want to sleep if that would require us to trust you and you've

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:27.860
just told us not to do that sounds like a double negative but I mean we have this

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:32.080
whole backstory that has been established you got you we know each other so well

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:37.120
why don't we head toward the tower you know what that's probably interesting so

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:42.640
interesting dude so we have a case we are like mine I mean like he's obviously

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:50.920
on the sharpie while yeah meanwhile back at the rain check back at the

01:38:50.920 --> 01:39:00.400
damn born whatever else thank you thank you for the information about father

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:05.040
tinder I well between those leads and what I'm sure our partners have turned

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:13.240
up I'd call this case just about closed yes you don't have to be flag cop and

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:22.800
know which way the wind is blowing this time all right I'm leaving I take out

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:25.760
the gold coins that I've perloined off of her dead husband as I think these

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:31.920
belong to you and our condolences but thank you for information and if it's

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:36.640
any if it's any assurance we will do our best to write whatever's wrong in

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:41.840
this town I thought we'd retired from the adventure game but it seems like when

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:46.520
it as soon as you get out they put it back in seems like seems like nothing

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:50.600
gets you in an adventure quicker than an avoiding one yeah we haven't learned

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:54.200
this from six years of stories we walk back in the town and we wait hold on

01:39:54.200 --> 01:40:00.920
one thing one thing that just to close up with the lady ma'am yeah I understand

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:08.560
this is a difficult time but this is also part of a larger thing zip was

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:14.320
there you talked about the things that he mentioned about about father tinder

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:20.160
being crazy were there any documents maps a secret artifacts things hidden

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:26.360
under his floorboards anything cinematically stowed away that you lock

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:35.840
it around his neck you're not there also where would you any incarnation of

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:41.680
you have learned that from any say he seems like a locket guy

01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:50.560
you keep you keep shouting out things to people who aren't in the room with us

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:56.000
and about it I mean I know I know one of the things is this you know you got to

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.960
come clean with me if you're a shapeshifter that's one thing yeah yeah

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.680
no I'm no shapeshifter okay well you know then you're crazy and that requires

01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:10.360
a bit of care he's right back to my bad no no evidence at all afraid not

01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:14.560
nothing incriminating documents no well God bless you ma'am and please stay

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:19.600
strong and at the risk of sounding crass I think you've got you know a lot of

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:26.840
years ahead of you and you look great I don't think that you know I don't think

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.800
that your life is over just because your alcoholic husband died well he never

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:41.320
no one it's your time that's true I myself had a father who it's pretty late

01:41:41.320 --> 01:42:03.640
okay I'm in the background shitting myself laughing I guess okay I get up

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:07.800

circle and I this is Father Tender's house and so and I and I we drop a

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:24.120
little battle plan like a little football play and I say here's the deal

01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:31.360
hit the just spitballing here me Christopher we're gonna sneak in sure

01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:35.760
you want me yes like little kittens yes we're good right you're gonna use your

01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:39.080
stealthy abilities to open the door use your tools your feet you have those I

01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:42.000
have stealthy ability probably have thieves kit and stuff like that oh yeah

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:48.320
look at that underneath the post it and we're gonna we're gonna break in

01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:52.040
SARS guard I want you nearby with the horse in case we have to make a hasty

01:55:52.040 --> 01:56:01.760
retreat Sharpie you're gonna be in the van I'll hide it in a pyramid of

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:07.480
juice barrels with several spells at the ready that okay the signal in case

01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:13.880
things go wrong is oh shit all right what if it's like something like oh

01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:18.960
silver dollar silver dollar so he doesn't know okay again good idea okay

01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:26.240
so we say it twice we have to see if we say it once it means get in here everything's

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:29.680
good okay we say it twice that means we're coming out and we're coming out

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:34.280
hot okay so okay should you make the signal for don't do something sound like

01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:41.480
an urgent version of do something okay come on again if I if you if you see me

01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:44.440
at least not the way it was silver dollar but that means that means like

01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:52.120
coast is clear okay that means that means it's bad now I think I don't have

01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:57.200
if I go silver dollar that means I'm coming somebody killed me while I was

01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:08.880
saying silver dollar silver dollar if I say urgently that means I was stabbed

01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:12.520
in the process of saying silver dollar silver dollar and if you say silver

01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:18.800
dollar twice casually wait so wait you're saying if you say it once excitedly

01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:25.000
it's the same as saying it twice I'm saying if I say silver dollar any

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.880
amount of times casually the coast is probably clear but I'm not going to

01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:33.040
because that's going to confuse it oh so the code the code isn't based on

01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:38.200
repetition the code is based on tone of voice well two silver dollars two silver

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:42.120
dollars means it's it's bad things have gone even if you're even if you're

01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:46.360
calmly even if you're like okay maybe I'm whispering maybe there's a guy behind

01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:52.480
those silver dollars all right okay uh Adam shut up we have we already have

01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:58.840
our bed up here all right no we're not gonna order pancakes it's the middle

01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:04.480
of the night all right so okay are you guys ready to do this yeah are we clear

01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:11.320
on the signals absolutely just we know two silver dollars is bad right kind of

01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:17.040
sometimes okay we're running over time here so we are so Chris de Burgh and I we

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:21.320
sneak up hold on hold on okay this bull before you guys leave spit bulbs like

01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:27.080
it's dangerous to go alone take this and he gives you he gives you a bundle of

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:31.760
black sackcloth and he's like don't use this unless there's a serious serious

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:37.360
emergency and also it'd get destroyed by the barrier just keep that in mind bye

01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:44.480
we got a ball sackcloth yeah exactly remember that sackcloth tell your sober

01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:48.320
self to remember that sackcloth sackcloth we got a black cloth that that's

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:51.840
that would be bad if we touch the barrier with it yeah can't leave it's can't

01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:54.620
leave the town with it use it in case of emergency but don't take it to the

01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:59.640
barrier not when it's active not when it's active so you gotta use it bank yes

01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:04.800
okay okay I guess to wrap this episode up we all get together in a huddle we put

01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:10.640
our hands in like a football team and so Sharpie you want to say a couple
