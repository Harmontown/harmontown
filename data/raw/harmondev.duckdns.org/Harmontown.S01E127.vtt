00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Nerdmelt Theater.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
This is Harmontown.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Please welcome your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:09.000 --> 00:18.000
Thank you.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
Good to be back at our headquarters.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
We've been abroad a lot, unpredictable schedules.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
I never know when we're here, when we're not.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Who's Comptroller? Who is? Who's not?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Whoever's just hanging out at your house.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Guess Comptroller, Dave Horowitz, everybody.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Hi, guys.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I have a couple of things I can talk about,

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
but I do think that we should be prepared for a terrible show.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
No, no.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I feel laconic. I feel neutral.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
The pressures of nuptials, nuptial pressure?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Impending nuptials, yes.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Impending nuptials?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
The pressure of impending nuptials?

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
The pressure of impending nuptials, yeah.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
You compensate for them with a kind of dead calm, like you...

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Because you don't want to be one of these people that's nervous about getting married,

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
because that would be dumb.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
You'd be in a certs commercial or a Mentos commercial.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Looking for a quick fix because you blew a cufflink and then you put a Mentos on it.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
Who cares? I'm cool. I live in LA.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Joel McCale's going to be at my wedding.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm not going to fucking put some pressure on it.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
The guy from the soup's going to be there.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
He's going to smell fear like a dog.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
He'll get up and start heckling me.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
He'll call me a Kardashian.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
I've got to be cool, but nothing to do with that.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
It's obviously also the beginning of the second half.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
The second and probably last half of my life.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
You only get two.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
When it comes to halves, you're guaranteed a maximum of two.

02:14.000 --> 02:24.000
Starting the second half of your life, there is a subtle realization there that you are now officially dying.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Absolutely more so than being born.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
You are now more dying.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
Because your next tasks include, for instance, helping someone else get born,

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
and handing the reins off to him before your third heart attack proves

02:42.000 --> 02:50.000
to be irreconcilable, as the doctors might say in some strange universe where doctors are extra coy.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
It's a truly romantic way to think about marriage.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Replication.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Replication, like the humble mosquito who lives its life,

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
and then at the end of its full mosquito life, which I think probably spans a day,

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
we're always like, what are you doing? Who flies in a face like that?

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
And the mosquito is like, this is it!

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
And we're just like, unbelievable, will you knock it off?

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
This is all I have!

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
It's comforting to think of things in those terms.

03:30.000 --> 03:42.000
This is it. I am about to lay eggs in a puddle outside your mailbox in some swampy land

03:42.000 --> 03:51.000
where hopefully a giant frog tongue won't rake across my deposits, rendering them pointless.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
What's your frog tongue?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
It's Chevy Chase.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Oh no! Does he know about the wedding?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
He'll be back.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
No, I just thought that was a comedy brain thing.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
What should I say there? What is my frog tongue?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
My frog tongue is spiders. Motherfucker!

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
Okay, so Erin came home and there's a black widow with a web on the stairs.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
She's taken pictures of it. She's like, oh, there's a black widow.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
She's got a blackated lower glass on its back. It was eating a caterpillar in the fucking thing

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
because everything about them has to be so modeling and extreme.

04:38.000 --> 04:46.000
It couldn't just be eating a fly, it's eating a fucking beetle-butter fly.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.580
I don't know why that's that's that's that's hoy-polloy shit. I'm only the fat of an unbaptized caterpillar

04:55.540 --> 04:57.740
Will quench this black widow's thirst

04:59.140 --> 05:06.620
Yeah, it's sitting there. It's you know, do you just like watching it wriggle and it's a black widow and you know if they bite you

05:08.980 --> 05:12.060
You know probably won't kill you, but if you're a small child or a lamb a

05:12.060 --> 05:15.060
A baby lamb

05:18.780 --> 05:23.120
It'll take you out and when's the last time you went to work

05:28.020 --> 05:30.660
On enough toxins to take out a baby lamb

05:31.500 --> 05:33.500
That's gonna fuck up my shooting schedule

05:34.220 --> 05:40.460
Which is which is a professional form of death black widows are dangerous. They're not brown look recluses, but they're dangerous

05:40.460 --> 05:46.460
I got off on a that was I don't know if you remember what with the point. Oh, that's my frogs tongue spiders, okay?

05:47.900 --> 05:49.900
Okay, so

05:49.900 --> 05:54.220
I was in the middle of something. What was it? Oh, I'm dying because I'm getting married

05:54.340 --> 05:59.820
So I my body knows that but my mind so my mind therefore puts this like I

06:00.340 --> 06:07.860
Have no choice over it. My mind is just going like hey, man. What's good? Like I have to affect this like weird McConaughey draw

06:07.860 --> 06:10.580
I don't care about anything

06:11.620 --> 06:13.620
Just get married man

06:14.340 --> 06:19.020
Because otherwise I'll panic and I'll like like I'll achieve my final form

06:19.940 --> 06:26.580
But you're gonna be feeling it up there the emotional flood will be too much for your steel you McConaughey reserve like it's gonna

06:27.220 --> 06:29.820
I don't plan on spending the ceremony itself

06:30.620 --> 06:33.980
Withholding anything I will give it my all but but I

06:33.980 --> 06:40.140
I've it's it's a it's a it's a week of it's a week of nerves for the nerve full

06:42.460 --> 06:47.740
So one one mitigates one's nerves, all right, I'm definitely gonna cry not right now

06:48.860 --> 06:50.860
But when it happens

06:53.300 --> 06:55.300
My mic right now

06:56.180 --> 06:58.180
You want to cry right now?

06:58.180 --> 07:05.580
Yeah, do you want to just say something sad to me? Yeah, just you do you know me a little like maybe like get really in there in my

07:05.660 --> 07:07.660
Insecurities and I'll see what happens

07:07.700 --> 07:09.700
Do you know that?

07:09.700 --> 07:12.060
When they cleared the debris at Waco

07:14.620 --> 07:16.620
They found the skeletons of

07:17.220 --> 07:21.140
Preteen children who died in the arms of their parents

07:21.420 --> 07:27.260
But they hadn't burnt to death because they could tell because the skeletons were bent backwards

07:27.260 --> 07:29.940
Which is a sign of cyanide poisoning?

07:30.460 --> 07:35.460
They had they had they had died in terrible pain and that broke their own backs like

07:38.060 --> 07:40.740
He's laughing I made him

07:45.500 --> 07:52.820
Actually, I was like this isn't gonna work and then it was like it got to rose to real I felt too many things in 30 seconds

07:52.980 --> 07:54.980
Fuck you man

07:54.980 --> 07:56.740
That's not cool

07:56.740 --> 08:01.740
Okay, I'll talk here. I'll make you cry. Let's I'll tell you something. I'll make you cry. Okay. Go ahead

08:02.460 --> 08:05.140
Did you know that when you mute someone on Twitter?

08:06.260 --> 08:09.420
If they tweet at you, you'll still see it

08:10.860 --> 08:12.860
It really doesn't matter

08:13.340 --> 08:18.820
The only people you can mute are just people who just spout nonsense into the dry air like that person

08:18.820 --> 08:23.300
Yes, we all have one of they really you really see it if they tweeted you even if you isn't that true, right?

08:23.300 --> 08:25.300
No, I

08:26.740 --> 08:28.100
Know

08:28.100 --> 08:32.860
So there's so there's like 50 people right now tweeting me all the time going like hello, I

08:35.300 --> 08:42.980
Addressed that joke to you like that. I'm just ignoring them. Okay. That's cool. All right. Well good. That's the way it should work

08:42.980 --> 08:52.940
Why even why even block anybody anymore then right? I mean I I I did a large unfollow

08:54.260 --> 08:56.260
Recently, I mean I don't have quite the

08:56.820 --> 09:00.740
Nobody cared that I did it, but I was like I can't I

09:01.260 --> 09:04.800
Muted a few people and it didn't it didn't give me the same rush as just going

09:05.500 --> 09:06.980
You're out

09:06.980 --> 09:09.220
The fuck out of my not real life

09:09.220 --> 09:14.260
You know about you know about our podcast producer Dustin Marshall's

09:15.700 --> 09:17.700
thing, right I

09:18.020 --> 09:20.620
Mean I he's got a lot of things. Yeah

09:21.140 --> 09:25.420
He I feel like I my my instinct is to whisper this

09:26.460 --> 09:31.740
He'll hear you no matter what I feel like I'm somehow like it's less harsh

09:31.740 --> 09:35.340
Like I feel like I'm embarrassing him less because I'm like keeping my voice down

09:35.340 --> 09:40.060
It might yeah, he's got headphones off. Yeah. Yeah, but I you know that he

09:40.740 --> 09:43.060
He keep he he keeps his

09:43.700 --> 09:47.180
Followers number like the people that he's following is

09:48.260 --> 09:55.540
666 and he yeah, so he can't start or stop following someone without replacing them so he can keep the number

09:55.620 --> 09:57.620
Yeah at 666

09:57.780 --> 09:59.780
Yeah

10:00.700 --> 10:03.500
Wait, I mean no matter what's going on with you. It could always be worse

10:03.500 --> 10:09.220
Is it better or worse that I do the same thing but with 420? I

10:10.460 --> 10:12.460
Think it makes me like way more chill

10:13.380 --> 10:15.380
But I could be wrong I

10:16.500 --> 10:20.340
I'm it's a rhetorical question, right? Yeah, no one's chiller than me

10:22.420 --> 10:26.940
Hey, did you know you could fit every planet in the solar system between the earth and the moon

10:26.940 --> 10:38.980
Spencer just told me that it's true. I don't why did I say it's true like I'm the judge. It's true. I

10:39.780 --> 10:44.940
Just found out did you know you can fit all of Boston in Brooklyn? Oh

10:46.140 --> 10:47.980
That's true

10:47.980 --> 10:51.700
That's what someone told me when I told them I was from Boston and they they were from New York

10:51.700 --> 10:55.700
And they were like you don't live in a real city and I was like prove it like your whole

10:55.700 --> 11:00.440
City could fit in my burrow. I was like cool Spike Lee

11:02.220 --> 11:05.980
Like I was saying they were like spike. It wasn't actually Spike Lee

11:05.980 --> 11:12.180
I heard a guy rapping once about how each of his fingers was a burrow and

11:12.820 --> 11:17.580
And so when he makes a fist he's got the whole he's got all of New York in the palm of his hand

11:17.580 --> 11:20.580
And I think it was Lloyd. What's his name? Lloyd Benson?

11:20.580 --> 11:26.340
Lloyd Benz? Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber? Lloyd Benz?

11:26.980 --> 11:35.900
Yeah, he said he goes. Yeah, the trigger finger is Staten Island and the middle finger is Queens and the I used to sling rock and

11:36.380 --> 11:38.700
Manhattan so you know the pinkies what I mean

11:40.220 --> 11:45.940
Ring finger is the Bronx because I hope that to meet the love of my life there one day

11:45.940 --> 11:50.620
If my if my current career trajectory takes me where they hope to go

11:51.140 --> 11:53.700
But I digress and the and the thumb is

11:54.340 --> 11:57.820
Is Radio City Music Hall? I don't remember all the burrows

11:58.660 --> 12:01.980
And then and then I think that that's kind of cool

12:02.380 --> 12:07.060
There's there's there's no way that the real song is better than that

12:07.740 --> 12:09.300
That was the best

12:09.300 --> 12:14.060
And also I did like how you said I heard a guy rapping once like you walked past him on the street

12:14.060 --> 12:19.500
And then you're like it was Lloyd Benz. Well, it was part of that part of that Buster Rhyme song that he did like 40

12:21.100 --> 12:23.100
40,000 remixes of

12:24.500 --> 12:27.100

He did one that was just all the queens of the game

14:00.300 --> 14:03.940
There's a little doff of the cap to the Ferris sex. He had

14:04.620 --> 14:06.620

14:20.980 --> 14:24.940
And then but then in the video for it. They like switches back and forth. It doesn't

14:25.340 --> 14:31.420
This Mary J. Blige have like a have like an alter ego. No, she's like a very soulful lady

14:31.420 --> 14:35.140
I know that's kind of her thing. I feel like Mary J. Blige like you remember

14:35.140 --> 14:41.260
You know how Garth Brooks had like this angel angel man, whatever. Yeah, Chris Gaines Chris Gaines brooding

14:41.260 --> 14:48.260
Bangs, I feel like Mary J. Blige had like a had like a bad guy persona. That was like blik blik blik blik blik

14:48.660 --> 14:52.620
Mary or something. It was like it was like Mitchell Plick or something. It was like backwards

14:53.420 --> 14:57.540
And that that she could she could say like like like less soulful things

14:57.540 --> 15:01.380
I thought I thought that was depicted in the video to like she was I

15:01.900 --> 15:03.900
Could be mixing a bunch of stuff up

15:04.620 --> 15:06.620
But check it out kids

15:06.620 --> 15:12.740
I don't want to look for this song now. I mean, there's nine. I'd literally nine remixes of it

15:12.740 --> 15:16.180
I mean if I look if I just do touch it in Google, I'm not gonna find it

15:16.180 --> 15:19.940
Tuck it, lick it, put it, stick it, put it, poop it in your booty

15:22.100 --> 15:24.100
Yeah

15:26.380 --> 15:34.380
It's pretty cool. It's a cool song. It was at least nominated for a VMA in 2006. I know that for sure

15:34.380 --> 15:41.980
I'll just go into my Excel spreadsheet of 2006 VMA nominees that I keep in in Google Drive that you and I share

15:41.980 --> 15:43.620
So you should just be able to have it right now

15:43.620 --> 15:46.100
So Aaron was making fun of me playing Minecraft

15:46.100 --> 15:51.500
I play a lot of Minecraft and then Aaron makes fun like she looks over at the laptop and then she asks me

15:52.940 --> 15:57.540
Questions about Minecraft that are designed not to not for her to start

15:57.540 --> 16:04.380
Like it enjoying the game like it's not she acts like it's like her like becoming interested in Minecraft

16:04.380 --> 16:07.740
But it's just to shame me and mock me for playing Minecraft

16:08.060 --> 16:13.060
So she asked me last night. She said did you she just there's just a barrage of them

16:13.060 --> 16:16.420
Like I'm just I'll be cutting down a tree and she goes like are you did you get your?

16:17.340 --> 16:19.340
Did you remember your backpack?

16:20.820 --> 16:22.820
I just like try to ignore her and go like

16:22.820 --> 16:30.620
Oh, there's no backpacks. I'm cutting down a tree. Oh, yeah, did you do you need to

16:31.980 --> 16:36.500
Do you need scorpion poison? No, there's nothing and then she and then she said

16:37.740 --> 16:40.300
Did you do you have all of your scent gems?

16:41.420 --> 16:45.420
And then she started laughing so hard she almost died

16:46.180 --> 16:50.020
In bed. She couldn't breathe because she was so entertained

16:50.020 --> 16:53.020
Yeah, by her riff sent gems

16:54.780 --> 16:56.620
Sorry wrote down sent gems

16:56.620 --> 17:02.460
Those are really some of the best laps you can have when it doesn't matter even what the other person's enjoyment level is

17:02.460 --> 17:06.460
But when you say something that tickles you to your yeah deeply to your core

17:06.500 --> 17:08.940
Yeah, you can just ride that out for an hour

17:08.940 --> 17:14.580
I would I would I would take that version to Aaron and all the all the time like that's my fit like what she she makes

17:14.580 --> 17:16.580
Her self laugh and then she goes

17:16.580 --> 17:18.580
Oh

17:19.340 --> 17:21.340
She can't take it anymore

17:21.460 --> 17:23.940
Like it usually has to be you know

17:24.620 --> 17:27.820
Victimizing someone else in order for her to find it really that funny

17:29.060 --> 17:35.700
She must have just really made a lot of fun of me to be laughing so hard that her epiglottis is like revolting

17:37.900 --> 17:40.620
But I do like the sound it's the sound of true joy

17:41.380 --> 17:43.380
You can yeah, if you could bottle it

17:43.380 --> 17:51.420
The question would be gone, man, or if I could just live live with it by virtue of legal vows for the next 40 to 55

17:55.940 --> 18:01.620
Polite clapping for impending nuptials impending nuptials

18:01.860 --> 18:04.340
All right, so I want to bring Spencer crittenden up here

18:04.340 --> 18:13.300
Unceremoniously Spencer crittenden come out Spencer. Oh

18:18.900 --> 18:23.220
What's what's up, it's good to be back. Thank you

18:26.260 --> 18:30.180
This is our first show back since terminating the tour right

18:30.180 --> 18:35.540
Uh, yeah, I think we were back here for it. Well, the Joe McDonald's during the tour

18:36.020 --> 18:39.940
Okay, well that the definition of tour I don't get because we you know

18:39.940 --> 18:44.180
I'd be working every day and then I'd have to get on a red eye and go to hey me too

18:44.180 --> 18:45.940
I was doing those same things

18:45.940 --> 18:49.620
I know but I don't know when you call it a tour then because it's like it's not really a tour

18:49.620 --> 18:52.620
It's if you go to the post office. It's not a tour

18:53.540 --> 18:56.660
Because you're coming go leaving I would never consider that a tour. No

18:56.660 --> 18:59.540
No, it's more of a trip

19:01.700 --> 19:07.220
Uh, Spencer, do you like Busta Rhymes? Yeah, that was so great. It was it was

19:08.340 --> 19:12.420
I don't think Busta would be happy with that, but I was I was quite tickled

19:16.500 --> 19:20.100
He wouldn't disagree that he says his own name at least 12 times the song he does

19:20.820 --> 19:22.820
It's in his record contract

19:22.820 --> 19:26.820
Wait, Dan, is this the song?

19:37.620 --> 19:43.620
Don't touch me throw the water on him. It's touch it remix. It can't be that hard to find it was it was

19:43.620 --> 19:46.500
quite a popular song among the hips and the hops

19:46.500 --> 19:54.580
If it was touch it there's been remixes by everyone who's existed so it might be actually a bit hard to hone in on

19:56.820 --> 20:01.620
You know you talked about that spider. What was the end of that spider story when we last left?

20:01.620 --> 20:05.220
It's still existed in your house. What the fuck? Well, Aaron, it's not

20:06.580 --> 20:12.980
It was out by the mailbox. Okay, still every time you're walking up those dark stairs to my mansion. Yeah

20:12.980 --> 20:18.420
Yeah, now there's a new reason you could die other than just you'll fall and it's like

20:19.300 --> 20:21.300
Cut yourself open on these sharpened

20:22.340 --> 20:26.340
Dreamwork stairs. I always think about that those dreamwork stair impalements

20:26.500 --> 20:27.700
Um

20:27.700 --> 20:32.340
Now if you now you might fall down to the last thing you'll see as a spider going like oh my god

20:32.420 --> 20:34.420
It's the biggest caterpillar ever

20:34.420 --> 20:41.860
Um, you don't want to kill it or anything Aaron takes care of that stuff. She's

20:42.980 --> 20:46.020
She has a video of the spider and a video of her killing it

20:46.580 --> 20:53.620
Um, oh, she killed it. So then I came home. She killed it. Okay enclosure. Thank you. That's all I needed here

20:54.740 --> 20:59.940
So I came home and I do a sweep with the flashlight now. I'm on the lookout for black widow. Sure

21:01.140 --> 21:03.140
and uh

21:03.140 --> 21:09.620
You know and I find eight nine ten of them. Uh, like like like everywhere. Well because I don't know what they look like

21:09.860 --> 21:11.860
Oh, oh, and so I'm

21:13.860 --> 21:19.380
All spiders are now black widows and I'm like I because I'm not gonna look for the hourglass and some of them are small

21:19.460 --> 21:21.460
And I'm like, there's black widows everywhere

21:22.020 --> 21:27.780
We should call a service of some kind and then Aaron was like those aren't black widows. That's not a release

21:27.860 --> 21:32.180
It's not a story. I like it though. I just am glad that they she killed it

21:32.180 --> 21:36.900
I mean, I don't hate spiders, but I when it's a black widow. I mean, that's jeez

21:36.980 --> 21:39.300
You don't want to you don't want to tangle with that sort of thing

21:39.460 --> 21:45.940
Here's the weird thing about Aaron or not weird at all really if you know her personality like when there's a spider on the wall

21:46.260 --> 21:48.260
in the root in the house

21:48.260 --> 21:54.500
Um, like I I just go like, okay. I'll if I have to I'll just I'll find something and I'll kill it

21:54.500 --> 22:01.860
I'm superstitious about it for some dumb reason. Um, that's a classic superstition. I know it's so stupid. But but

22:02.100 --> 22:07.300
Like before I'll do that Aaron. I'll be like, I'll take care of it. But Aaron will just like she I don't

22:07.300 --> 22:09.860
So there's some people who are like really good with spiders

22:10.500 --> 22:14.980
And then there's some people who are terrified of them. Aaron just I always she just

22:15.220 --> 22:22.660
If I describe her behavior to you like like you wouldn't know which one she was because she just she'll take like a coat hanger and just poke at it

22:22.660 --> 22:26.020
Like and then although like like I don't even know what she's trying to do

22:26.020 --> 22:29.300
Just agitate it and I'll go like why what are you trying to do?

22:29.300 --> 22:33.780
No, just and then she's like poking it and then the spider like fall

22:34.100 --> 22:36.100
Under the floor and then she'll go

22:36.100 --> 22:38.100
Ah

22:38.100 --> 22:40.100
What are you doing?

22:40.100 --> 22:46.820
I don't I don't what was the attempt like she wanted it to crawl onto the coat hanger and she was gonna be like, uh

22:47.380 --> 22:50.580
gentle gentle bend or what what's a

22:50.580 --> 22:58.260
Gentle bend or what's a uh, uh, it's gentle bend. Yeah, we all know. No, who is uh, Dan Haggerty played him and gentle bend

22:58.900 --> 23:02.420
No, no, no grizzly grizzly Adams grizzly Adams

23:06.660 --> 23:12.180
I like gentle bend. I think who's gentle is gentle bend was the name of the bear in grizzly Adams. I think

23:12.820 --> 23:14.820
I thought he just called him Ben

23:15.380 --> 23:17.540
Grizzly Adams was a show in the 70s

23:17.540 --> 23:21.060
This is this is how little you could take your business elsewhere a network tv

23:21.300 --> 23:26.260
I grizzly Adams was just a guy that lived in the woods and that is it

23:27.860 --> 23:34.340
He he wasn't wanted for a murder. He hadn't committed. He wasn't a counterfeiter. He wasn't he couldn't turn into a snake

23:34.740 --> 23:35.860
he

23:35.860 --> 23:38.980
His parents weren't vampires. He didn't he didn't go on dates

23:39.220 --> 23:41.220
He sat in a fucking cabin

23:41.220 --> 23:47.940
And he had a beard and he hung out and it was like I guess the other two networks had news on or something

23:48.900 --> 23:54.420
Did they make a lot of episodes? Yeah, I think it was on all the time. Like I'm it's it's burnt into my memory

23:54.500 --> 23:58.740
And he had obviously friends who also lived in the woods. There was a guy that was like a prospector

23:59.300 --> 23:59.940
Sure

23:59.940 --> 24:03.780
Who had a mule and he would walk around up on the hills and he was like very cranky

24:04.420 --> 24:07.620
and then so then grizzly Adams was like a kind of cool like

24:07.620 --> 24:10.420
Nights in white satin kind of shirt

24:11.460 --> 24:15.380
But he would cut cut his own wood and he had a big beard and long hair and he would he would just go like

24:15.700 --> 24:18.180
Hey, cranky cranky tom, whatever the guy's name was

24:18.820 --> 24:24.180
Don't be so mean like like he just he just lived in the woods and it sounds like a children's show the way I'm describing it

24:24.260 --> 24:27.300
It sounds like they would like play on a loop in a museum or something

24:29.300 --> 24:33.140
Yeah, it sounds like something that will inevitably teach you about weights and measures or something

24:33.140 --> 24:39.460
Yeah, it's some Canadian you stick around long enough. There's like a teaching moment about splitting wood and angles and stuff

24:40.020 --> 24:43.140
All right, so I want to address some concerns about my dog. Oh

24:44.820 --> 24:46.820
um, so, uh

24:47.140 --> 24:52.980
I don't and I don't know how much of this I have explained at the show yet, but I know like like the uh, the new tv's

24:54.340 --> 24:56.340
The dogs can see them

24:57.460 --> 24:59.220
They're watching what we watch now

24:59.220 --> 25:04.100
There are eyes and our eyes are seeing the same thing because the tv's are different now

25:05.060 --> 25:06.260
I'm telling you

25:06.260 --> 25:07.460
you're right

25:07.460 --> 25:13.620
And uh harvey if there's ever a uh dog or a squirrel or a cat or and he'll react to each one

25:14.260 --> 25:17.060
differently or a deer, but like not a

25:17.940 --> 25:24.420
Cockroach like like he won't he she differentiates it if it's like a cartoon cat. Yeah, it's crazy

25:24.420 --> 25:29.700
Well, that was the new thing was that then we were they were watching the simpsons and santa's little helper came on

25:30.260 --> 25:32.260
Cartoon dog harvey starts going nuts

25:33.140 --> 25:38.420
He's recognizing a cartoon dog. That's the next step is he could read the word dog. Yeah

25:41.620 --> 25:45.940
That's a it's a symbol for a dog. It's not it doesn't even how could it have any

25:47.140 --> 25:52.980
Any it doesn't make any sense and we tested it like he doesn't he looks at the cartoon of the dog

25:52.980 --> 25:57.460
And he starts going crazy. Yeah, we were I think he was watching or

25:58.020 --> 26:02.980
He was watching with the like the rainbow bright cartoon movie was on and there's like a scene with like a kid in the snow

26:02.980 --> 26:08.980
And he's got a dog and harvey just started going nuts and I was watching him and I couldn't believe it, but also

26:09.780 --> 26:12.420
He freaks out when he sees himself if you like show him a picture

26:12.500 --> 26:15.780
Well, that's what erin did and I was by the time I caught erin doing it

26:15.780 --> 26:20.180
It was too late because it erin erin videotaped with her phone

26:20.180 --> 26:26.580
Harvey put it airplayed it out of the tv. So harvey starts going apeshit. Yeah

26:31.220 --> 26:37.860
And that's so so so erin because she's insane she she videotaped harvey doing that

26:39.300 --> 26:44.180
Yeah, and then air plays that yeah, and then it's a video of the dog like

26:44.180 --> 26:48.740
And a dog and the real life dog goes like

26:52.580 --> 26:54.580
So then she does it again

26:55.620 --> 27:00.740
Yeah, and she's and I and she showed it to me and I was like stop that

27:01.780 --> 27:03.940
You're making him sentient. Yeah

27:05.780 --> 27:09.780
I saw like the fifth generation of it where it was like a crazy like

27:09.780 --> 27:14.100
Like where you shine a tv at a tv and there was just like a dog watching a dog

27:15.380 --> 27:17.380
He's like

27:18.580 --> 27:20.580
Like like the next thing would be like he would go

27:29.460 --> 27:31.460
And I don't know why that would be a goal

27:34.340 --> 27:37.060
She just thought it was funny it was disturbing

27:37.060 --> 27:41.620
He I mean because I think as fun as it seems hypothetically like no

27:41.700 --> 27:44.820
We wouldn't like it if he could if he was sent

27:44.900 --> 27:51.300
Like if he could speak he wouldn't be happy about a situation. No, he would not he would be like what the fuck are you guys doing to me?

27:51.460 --> 27:56.660
Why what did you do to me? Where are my testicles? I mean, I I've written about this

27:59.620 --> 28:01.620
The uh, yeah, I mean that was

28:01.620 --> 28:08.900
Yeah, that that episode of rick and morty was based on Justin's love of his little multises. I didn't have a dog at that time, but uh

28:09.940 --> 28:11.940
Yeah, it's very disturbing the dog

28:12.180 --> 28:15.940
He he he understands shit like he and he like

28:16.500 --> 28:20.660
I he's like I come home and he doesn't even I started to get mad that he

28:21.460 --> 28:26.660
Like he just sits at the top of the stairs and like I come home and he doesn't even like he doesn't come down to the door

28:26.740 --> 28:30.740
And he like he like lifts his head up and then he wags his tail like like while he's laying down

28:30.740 --> 28:36.260
And I just feel kind of like and then I get to the top of the stairs and he rolls over so I get scratch his belly and I'm like

28:36.980 --> 28:38.100
I

28:38.100 --> 28:40.100
I I work for him like

28:41.300 --> 28:46.100
And so I was like it'd be nice if he I mean when the pizza guy comes over he goes down to the door

28:47.460 --> 28:51.780
And Aaron says because he's get pizza and I'm like, well that's what Aaron says here

28:51.860 --> 28:56.260
I'll put a bag of treats in the potted plant outside the door

28:57.060 --> 28:59.060
when you come home from work

28:59.060 --> 29:03.380
Take a treat and then you know give him a treat every time you come in

29:04.500 --> 29:08.020
And then he'll and then he'll you'll get the pizza guy treatment if that's what you want so bad

29:09.460 --> 29:14.820
And uh, but you know, it's like the first the first time we tried it. I come in and he's like

29:15.620 --> 29:17.620
I think he could hear the bag

29:17.620 --> 29:19.620
And then I got the treat

29:19.860 --> 29:24.180
And so then the second night I come home. I open the door and he goes straight to the potted plant

29:24.180 --> 29:30.740
He's like, oh, he said he's yeah, every time he comes home. He there's that bag in the plant

29:32.420 --> 29:34.420
He's way too smart

29:34.580 --> 29:37.460
There's there have been times and like, you know, so I'm a

29:38.500 --> 29:41.140
I I've never had a pet in my whole life

29:41.540 --> 29:47.380
And that's too long because I'm like a gross dog person like not gross but like I'm I love dogs the most

29:48.020 --> 29:49.380
and I've

29:49.380 --> 29:51.380
I think Harvey's my friend so

29:51.940 --> 29:53.460
we have like a

29:53.460 --> 29:56.180
We're friends, but every there are times when I will look at him

29:56.580 --> 30:01.700
And I will think that there's a man in a dog suit because he's his eyes are too expressive

30:01.780 --> 30:05.460
He has those weird those whites of his eyes. So is there any ways and it's back and opens the bow?

30:06.180 --> 30:08.180
Yeah

30:08.180 --> 30:10.820
It just looks like a dude like you expect me to be like, hey

30:11.380 --> 30:13.380
Like if you're rubbing his belly, he's like

30:13.380 --> 30:19.060
Hey, man a little if you said like a little to the left I would I would freak out but not as much as if another dog

30:19.060 --> 30:20.580
You'd be like, oh, yeah, okay

30:20.580 --> 30:22.260
What?

30:22.260 --> 30:26.260
He sleeps in between me and Aaron like a like an eight-year-old boy

30:30.020 --> 30:32.020
Wait what?

30:33.620 --> 30:35.620
You know

30:35.780 --> 30:40.580
Like before when you got a caught uh, when you got a dog when you hired that eight-year-old boy to sleep with you

30:40.580 --> 30:55.700
He sleeps right in the eight-year-old boy spot on my bed. I had uh, there was uh, there was something else

30:55.940 --> 31:01.700
I felt like there was something else. Oh, can we hey, can we can we tee up at least just so it's at the ready?

31:01.700 --> 31:09.220
Just like a like a like a just a kind of a laid-back rap beat

31:12.020 --> 31:14.020
Oh

31:15.780 --> 31:18.500
Nice nice control because I feel like it's thank you

31:19.540 --> 31:21.540
It's a lazy show and a

31:22.100 --> 31:25.380
And I wanted to try to embrace that and turn it into entertainment

31:26.180 --> 31:30.100
And get myself a little excited because you can you can tell I'm phoning it in

31:30.100 --> 31:33.060
I can't. Oh, no. Yeah

31:33.700 --> 31:36.340
Oh, I have suspicions, but I can't tell

31:37.460 --> 31:42.100
Well, you guys have other stuff to do. I think they can tell they didn't really think that until you said it and now they're like, no

31:43.540 --> 31:47.140
That guy knew who uh, who came here from the farthest tonight

31:49.060 --> 31:55.060
Moscow Moscow, who's the Moscow guy? I don't even know what you said. You could have said I need a kidney help me

31:55.060 --> 32:00.660
Okay, do you want to come up Moscow and just talk to us we won't pick on you

32:02.500 --> 32:04.500
I think

32:07.060 --> 32:09.860
I guess we got that laid-back beat in the wings

32:10.820 --> 32:14.500
Here you could sit there and take this mic. Thank you. What's in the backpack?

32:15.380 --> 32:20.420
It's uh, actually all my life things and I'm from Russia and I'm afraid

32:20.420 --> 32:25.700
It's uh, I can get robbed. Yeah, I mean that's jackpot

32:28.340 --> 32:30.340
Podcast jackpot

32:32.580 --> 32:37.300
There's so many things so many things a stranger can say when they get on stage at a podcast

32:38.500 --> 32:40.500
All of my life savings are in my backpack

32:40.500 --> 32:48.500
Is is you know, that's that says that's right up there with I'm gay black and blind

32:50.500 --> 32:53.540
Uh, uh, uh, what's your name first of all?

32:55.300 --> 32:57.860
Zhenya, but I can you don't want to say

32:59.620 --> 33:01.620
Actually, that was my name. Oh

33:03.860 --> 33:05.860
I didn't I didn't mean it was a

33:06.740 --> 33:08.740
I didn't mean it didn't sound like a name

33:08.740 --> 33:13.300
I I saw hesitance on your face and I thought maybe that you

33:14.020 --> 33:19.860
American analog is something like Eugene. Oh you so is it a Chinese name? Uh,

33:20.900 --> 33:22.900
Not not Eugene the other one

33:23.620 --> 33:26.900
What what is the what's the origin of the of your real name?

33:28.500 --> 33:30.900
It's you you're born in russian. That's your russian name

33:31.460 --> 33:34.900
Actually, I was born in russian, but my grandfather is

33:34.900 --> 33:42.500
From vietnam. I never knew him. So is that a vietnamese name the first one you mentioned? No, no, it's actually it's totally

33:43.140 --> 33:46.180
Russian totally russian. Okay. That's can you say it again because I

33:46.900 --> 33:51.540
Zhenya Zhenya, okay. I you know what? I'm racist because when you said Zhenya

33:51.780 --> 33:54.420
I pictured it spelled with an x and a bunch of like

33:55.060 --> 33:57.060
vowels

33:57.380 --> 34:01.140
The uh, so Eugene is the way it gets kind of uh

34:02.100 --> 34:04.100
you you've got

34:04.100 --> 34:06.100
pushkin version of

34:06.420 --> 34:08.180
yeah

34:08.180 --> 34:10.580
Evgenia negin it's like Eugene

34:12.020 --> 34:17.860
Have you have seen yvgeni before a lot, but never the way that you just pronounced it this for your name

34:18.660 --> 34:22.340
Well, it's like a it's different. It's like a modification though. Are there similar names?

34:23.060 --> 34:25.780
It's a short version. Oh, okay

34:26.500 --> 34:30.820
Have you lived in russia your whole life? Yeah, and this is the first time you've been in the u.s

34:30.820 --> 34:36.740
Yes, so how does it come to be that you're all of your worldly possession? Is it just you travel you travel to the hill?

34:38.740 --> 34:41.780
Well, I can tell a long Russian

34:42.740 --> 34:46.820
short Russian, I guess it all depends on uh, if it involves werewolves or

34:48.260 --> 34:50.260
Or chess

34:50.900 --> 34:52.900
Well

34:52.900 --> 34:54.900
Joe mackerel counts as

34:55.860 --> 34:57.860
Joe

34:57.860 --> 34:59.860
definitely

34:59.860 --> 35:03.060
Well, uh, his hair certainly changes at night

35:06.100 --> 35:11.460
Well, uh, actually I saw Joe mackerel messed up some video show and

35:12.740 --> 35:18.660
Everyone's talked about his oh, he just didn't give them about

35:20.020 --> 35:22.020
That video show and I

35:22.900 --> 35:24.660
Just wanted to

35:24.660 --> 35:27.060
Get to know what this guy. He's okay. He's

35:27.060 --> 35:30.420
This games are just shitty and

35:31.140 --> 35:32.500
He's

35:32.500 --> 35:39.460
Don't like to be here and he made the final guy who wears all jackets in a layer at

35:40.340 --> 35:42.340
I don't know how

35:42.900 --> 35:50.340
So Joe mackerel was on a show that you yeah, basically, uh, Joe mackerel. I looked here google google him

35:50.740 --> 35:52.580
he's uh in

35:52.580 --> 35:54.580
community he's

35:54.580 --> 35:56.580
uh

35:57.780 --> 36:00.260
What's what's community? I

36:01.300 --> 36:03.300
Watch that show and

36:04.180 --> 36:08.500
So you're you're you're a huge fan of Joe mackerel. So you googled community

36:08.980 --> 36:10.500
I

36:10.500 --> 36:14.660
Not when you knew the guy, but he's looked nice and oh

36:15.940 --> 36:19.460
How did you first how did you first come upon Joe mackerel?

36:19.460 --> 36:21.460
Oh

36:24.100 --> 36:26.820
Just watching tv in russia. Uh, no, it's

36:28.340 --> 36:30.340
Say thanks to piracy

36:31.060 --> 36:33.060
Yeah, oh

36:33.300 --> 36:35.540
You don't you downloaded Joe mackerel

36:37.620 --> 36:40.980
Uh, you actually come in through don't have all right, right

36:41.620 --> 36:45.620
What you're saying is the yeah, you're in russia. You bit torrented community

36:45.620 --> 36:49.140
Yeah, or something that Joel was in and then you're like, what the hell is this?

36:49.220 --> 36:55.140
And are you saying that you made a pilgrimage to come see this show because I mean you actually because

36:56.340 --> 36:58.340
of the harm on time because

36:58.340 --> 37:03.460
Uh, in in the end I got into harm on time. I started at the first

37:06.180 --> 37:08.580
Not season episode session

37:09.780 --> 37:12.740
And uh, I listened through all

37:13.460 --> 37:14.980
these series

37:14.980 --> 37:16.980
and

37:17.220 --> 37:19.220
Who's

37:29.220 --> 37:31.220
This is real is that real

37:33.140 --> 37:35.140
That was so flawless

37:36.020 --> 37:40.180
I at this point you could be a highly trained upright citizens brigade

37:42.020 --> 37:44.020
Practical joke

37:44.020 --> 37:46.020
You

37:46.020 --> 37:53.220
I just googled him and uh, there's a guy that plays in seven private ryan's

37:54.580 --> 37:56.580
ju guy

37:57.460 --> 38:00.740
But uh, oh you found the wrong adam gulberg. Yeah, the days

38:06.340 --> 38:10.340
Yeah, uh, is adam here are you here adam?

38:10.340 --> 38:12.340
I

38:12.340 --> 38:15.460
I bet we thought we'd never hear you say those words

38:16.980 --> 38:19.860
Uh adam, do you want to come up and meet this?

38:20.740 --> 38:25.940
This guy's this guy's traveled the globe. I mean not to meet you, but he's just curious about you

38:26.340 --> 38:28.820
I'd hope not. How's it going? This is adam gulberg. How's it going?

38:30.020 --> 38:34.980
I got you a wedding thing for Aaron. It's ace of spies. It's a game fun

38:35.860 --> 38:39.700
What should I get dan for his wedding? Well, I don't know. Are you on the clock?

38:39.700 --> 38:41.700
What's another game?

38:42.580 --> 38:45.140
Shadowrun I'm gonna get dan shadowrun for as well

38:46.500 --> 38:52.500
Thanks for helping me figure that out for my wedding if you get yourself shadowrun and then you we start to play in the new

38:52.580 --> 38:57.460
Year, we'll play shadowrun on the podcast. I feel like it'd just be easier if I got you shadowrun

38:58.340 --> 39:03.780
And then I have to game master. I don't know. I just you know, that's the end of it if I just gave it to you

39:05.860 --> 39:07.860
Thank you adam

39:07.860 --> 39:13.860
Uh, so you came here with all why do you have all your money with you? That's the mystery here, right?

39:15.300 --> 39:18.980
Well, when you leave russia, you don't just leave stuff in russia. They have bank

39:21.700 --> 39:25.620
Banks are capitalists. They just have a big pile of their stuff in the center of the

39:25.620 --> 39:39.380
I'm kidding. I it's not true. They they they converted to capitalism

39:39.380 --> 39:45.060
Our currency is falling down rising up in some other way like

39:46.420 --> 39:48.900
Yeah, even the currency is rising up. Yeah

39:50.340 --> 39:52.340
Well, who's ain't brother

39:52.340 --> 39:57.860
We got to go to that bitcoin business. We got to we got to we got to do some kind of google money now

39:58.020 --> 40:00.660
What if you can mine bitcoins in minecraft?

40:03.380 --> 40:05.380
Did I just make a million dollars?

40:06.420 --> 40:08.580
Spencer you got to go you got to get out of here, man

40:09.300 --> 40:12.580
You got to get out of here right now. I just start running like I have the golden ticket

40:13.780 --> 40:15.780
Out of my way

40:16.820 --> 40:19.460
I watched that bitcoin documentary and still don't understand it

40:19.460 --> 40:22.820
But what I do understand is that it is inevitable. It may not be bitcoin

40:22.820 --> 40:27.540
But obviously we have to go to some kind of peer-to-peer currency, right? Well, haven't I explained this to you dan?

40:28.020 --> 40:30.820
It's a cash register full of math. Yes. Yes

40:32.100 --> 40:38.180
The way I always so simple the way I always heard bitcoin was if I gave you a davin buster's dollar

40:38.500 --> 40:42.180
For every hour you spent idling your car. It's like that. Yes

40:42.500 --> 40:46.660
That's how much that's how much the money is worth and how much electricity it actually costs to make

40:46.660 --> 40:49.620
Well electricity who cares? Yeah, it's

40:54.260 --> 40:58.100
Yeah, well, I think at this point after watching this documentary

40:58.260 --> 41:02.420
I think that any arguments for or against bitcoin are kind of point

41:02.980 --> 41:05.940
It's sort of actually mute the larger conversation

41:06.340 --> 41:10.100
Or realization should be that like mp3 technology

41:10.100 --> 41:17.140
There is really nothing that's going to stop the nations of the world from inevitably if we if we continue to exchange

41:17.700 --> 41:21.140
Any kind of currency it's going to have to become a

41:21.940 --> 41:26.820
Global kind of peer-to-peer currency. There is no it's not because we're anarchists

41:26.900 --> 41:31.940
It's because the governments will not be able to sustain themselves while trying to endorse

41:32.580 --> 41:37.220
Different kinds of currency. They will one by one become incompatible with something that spreads

41:37.220 --> 41:42.420
I bet adam disagrees with that. I would I guess I you know me. Well, um

41:42.740 --> 41:48.900
The thing about having a universal currency. It's a really big staple of sci-fi even in shadow run

41:49.460 --> 41:50.660
but

41:50.660 --> 41:57.460
The ability to issue debt from huge nations to huge nations means that having the yen and having the dollar be different things

41:57.860 --> 42:01.940
Is really really useful. Well, if everything is like future bucks

42:01.940 --> 42:09.700
Then japan can't control their exports and imports or set taxes that say this is valued internally as a currency

42:09.940 --> 42:11.940
And this is worth less as we export it

42:12.180 --> 42:18.340
I I hear you there definitely agree that's that's that I mean in that I don't understand that shit at all

42:20.500 --> 42:27.060
And therefore I definitely readily accept that it's impossible to take but but there's a difference between saying universal

42:27.060 --> 42:34.100
Currency and peer-to-peer currency. What's the difference between a dollar and a bitcoin right now in terms of me being able to send it to you

42:34.100 --> 42:37.700
And you being able to send it to me. Hopefully in a large amount

42:38.260 --> 42:40.260
There's a cash register made of math

42:42.020 --> 42:45.620
A cash register is made of math it takes one and then it turns it into

42:46.180 --> 42:50.980
100 of something else that's dollars and pennies. Yeah, that's a cash register

42:51.780 --> 42:55.060
This is the most thrilling thing we should go back to talking about your dog who is so cute

42:55.060 --> 42:57.060
You

42:58.100 --> 43:01.700
Is it undignified or or embarrassing to admit?

43:04.100 --> 43:07.460
In my position or not that I don't understand anything you guys are talking about

43:08.180 --> 43:13.780
I'd say that's uh, that's a winning statement right there. A lot of people are on your side. I'm not trying. Yeah

43:13.780 --> 43:16.260
I mean if you don't yeah, okay, so a couple of people

43:16.900 --> 43:21.140
Also don't good. That's cool. Do you guys did you guys see interstellar because I didn't

43:21.140 --> 43:23.140
I

43:23.140 --> 43:28.340
That's a that's a movie you could see everywhere. Yeah, no, I don't I don't understand anything

43:28.580 --> 43:31.540
Not only do I not understand bitcoin. I don't understand the actual

43:31.940 --> 43:36.420
American dollar or any kind anything about economics worldwide. Okay, good

43:37.620 --> 43:46.820
The the thing that felt clear to me watching watching this documentary is that technology is going to affect currency as surely as it has affected culture

43:46.820 --> 43:54.100
Uh media of exchange like ideas the way that we shoot things edit things record things

43:54.500 --> 44:01.540
They become peer to peer over time. Uh, they they transcend things as relatively

44:03.460 --> 44:10.820
Vestigial as what country you live in over time. It just and it just seems like a safe enough bet

44:10.820 --> 44:16.660
I don't know but there's nothing there's no risk at that bet because it's either 50 years or 500 years or five years from now

44:16.660 --> 44:21.940
And I don't know which it is but but we are we are tending toward we are gonna end up

44:22.740 --> 44:26.980
Not like going. Oh, here's a picture of the queen on a piece of paper

44:27.060 --> 44:29.540
We're gonna we're going to be sending each other blip blops

44:30.820 --> 44:33.060
And they're gonna be called one thing because

44:34.100 --> 44:38.900
I mean, I don't know I still think there's a skill difference because channel 101 is the best this year

44:38.900 --> 44:45.940
As it's ever been in terms of cinematography in terms of quality in terms of people turning out half-hour long finales to some of their series

44:46.660 --> 44:52.340
Like but there's still a difference between an episode of community and the finale of fish bulbs are definitely my thing

44:53.780 --> 44:59.540
Which you should all watch because fish bowls is definitely my thing is fucking amazing and it tells you how the movie seven ends

45:00.020 --> 45:02.020
Whoa, all right

45:02.020 --> 45:04.020
Sorry everybody you get to meet Adam Goldberg

45:06.820 --> 45:09.860
I did it that was Adam Goldberg. What did you think?

45:11.380 --> 45:13.380
Great guy, but he's not in

45:14.580 --> 45:16.580
The movie he's not it's a very bright

45:17.780 --> 45:22.020
He's in the movie for like a frame. There is a shot of Adam Goldberg in the in the in the movie

45:22.500 --> 45:28.100
Yeah, he's reacting to something. Have you also seen have you seen days and confused because that same actor is in

45:28.100 --> 45:31.460
Have you seen Richard Linklater's days of confused?

45:32.180 --> 45:33.300
actually, no

45:33.300 --> 45:35.300
Is that guy Adam Goldberg is like

45:36.020 --> 45:38.020
He's like pacing around in the woods and he's like

45:38.340 --> 45:43.540
Dominate male monkey motherfucker and he's like pups his chest up. He's wearing an army jacket. Anyway, you should check it out

45:44.980 --> 45:47.380
It's the same guy and he's got a new sitcom on

45:48.820 --> 45:52.020
ABC is that the goldbergs can I okay?

45:52.020 --> 45:58.020
So the print adds a different Adam Goldberg the print ads of that show meet the goldbergs like they in some of them

45:58.020 --> 46:02.500
They tried to do this thing where oh, it's a bad picture. We're bad at taking pictures

46:02.580 --> 46:04.420
My eyes are closed during the picture

46:04.420 --> 46:10.740
But in some of the shots they don't understand how eyelids work and the lower eyelid goes up way too far

46:10.740 --> 46:13.060
And it looks hideous like they're reptile people

46:13.700 --> 46:19.780
And it's like how do you couldn't just you ask the people to close their eyes for the photo you had to photoshop these

46:19.780 --> 46:21.780
Disgusting eyelids. I'm sorry

46:23.140 --> 46:27.060
You you clearly haven't seen the show because it's about a family of reptile people

46:27.700 --> 46:28.660
so

46:28.660 --> 46:32.100
Like oh my inner eyelids stuck again before the big dance

46:34.820 --> 46:37.300
My tail fell off is it gonna regrow?

46:38.340 --> 46:44.900
Before photo picture day. That was the finale last season. It was really good the photo picture day episode photo picture

46:45.860 --> 46:48.260
All right, uh, new zealand guy. Where's the new zealand guy?

46:48.260 --> 46:50.820
Uh, you want to come up here for a second?

46:58.100 --> 47:03.620
What's your name matthew what brings you from new zealand? Um a lot bunch of tv stuff actually

47:04.180 --> 47:06.180
um, I kind of went to

47:06.820 --> 47:08.820
a table reads a family guy in the simpsons

47:09.460 --> 47:12.660
And spent a day on the set of a couple of tv shows what for?

Are you guys proud of your countries? Do you have patriotism where you come from?

48:41.620 --> 48:47.460

48:48.020 --> 48:50.020
The terms they're very Aussie Aussie Aussie

48:52.180 --> 48:54.020
I don't know

48:54.020 --> 48:56.020
We live there. Yeah, it's about it

48:57.140 --> 49:00.020
Yeah, I actually can call myself

49:00.740 --> 49:02.740
Patrick but

49:02.740 --> 49:04.740
Um

49:05.140 --> 49:12.660
Kings made some stupid decisions over the time. Yeah, you guys don't still have kings though. We know that

49:18.260 --> 49:23.540
Well, I mean how many terms has Putin been serving lately it's it's kind of like that right fella

49:23.700 --> 49:26.740
He's trying to be king. Are you allowed to say will he beat you up if he's he will

49:28.020 --> 49:30.020
Then I'll post news articles about it

49:30.020 --> 49:33.140
I don't know. He's got my

49:34.740 --> 49:39.220
In in in in Russian does the does the word Putin says, uh

49:40.740 --> 49:42.660
Putin's uh

49:42.660 --> 49:46.980
Because it's kind of uh, you know, you know what it is over here. He's like he's he's farting

49:48.660 --> 49:50.660
He's just Putin

49:51.060 --> 49:53.380
What are you doing over there, vladimir? I'm Putin

49:53.380 --> 50:00.660
Um, you like that is that is that uh, is that funny in Russia?

50:06.580 --> 50:08.580
Uh, because it's not here

50:10.660 --> 50:12.660
I'm hoping to get into the export business

50:14.180 --> 50:16.180
I guess I'll never know

50:17.140 --> 50:19.140
After this show

50:19.140 --> 50:21.140
Oh

50:22.180 --> 50:24.180
No, I judge it

50:25.940 --> 50:32.500
Um, I I have russia. I still have russia questions. Okay, so every like, uh, um

50:34.100 --> 50:36.100
The uh, the uh

50:38.820 --> 50:40.820
The alcoholism

50:40.820 --> 50:44.580
Yeah, that's uh, but of our lives. Yeah

50:45.460 --> 50:47.460
Is it and that do you what?

50:47.460 --> 50:49.460
Uh, why?

50:50.100 --> 50:54.740
Because because the the stereotype is because it's because of the weather it's just cold in russia

50:54.740 --> 50:58.260
So everybody drinks like it seems a little oversimplified

50:59.300 --> 51:01.620
Yeah, it's actually more than that

51:02.980 --> 51:04.980
Yeah

51:06.580 --> 51:08.580
How much more

51:09.540 --> 51:14.260
Well, everyone everyone is grumpy and don't want to

51:14.260 --> 51:16.260
Uh

51:16.660 --> 51:20.740
Rage against something he's just want to drink up

51:21.620 --> 51:23.620
Forget about things and

51:24.100 --> 51:29.140
So it's it's it's it's sad there that is the is the implication there

51:29.620 --> 51:34.340
Or is it just like with with america's rich tradition of like we have retail therapy

51:34.420 --> 51:38.660
Like we would just go like when things are at their most culturally obtuse

51:38.660 --> 51:44.900
We you would see us buying the most pants ever like cereal

51:45.060 --> 51:51.140
There'd be nine different cereals and there's like a cg bear going like sugar sugar sugar sugar sugar smack

51:53.300 --> 51:54.740
Uh

51:54.740 --> 51:59.140
It's just like everything's just kind of crazy in a consumery way and in russia

51:59.220 --> 52:00.260
It's like

52:00.260 --> 52:05.300
At the at the at the height of I guess at the height of the cold war is what i'm describing like when we were like

52:05.300 --> 52:08.980
Yeah, break dance got lots of velcro fuck russia

52:10.100 --> 52:13.860
I got seven kinds of toast seven seven seven kinds of toast carmel

52:14.580 --> 52:15.700
bacon

52:15.700 --> 52:17.700
m&m skittles way way

52:18.580 --> 52:20.100
um

52:20.100 --> 52:22.100
Those sound like great toasts

52:22.900 --> 52:27.620
This isn't there was more shit than you ever thought you needed like while we were like supposedly at

52:28.100 --> 52:30.980
In a cold war and then and then russia was

52:30.980 --> 52:35.140
At at that same height was like the average russian citizen was like

52:36.020 --> 52:40.420
They spent all my money combating those glow-in-the-dark pretzel commercials

52:40.500 --> 52:43.300
I'm gonna just sit here in my cubicle and drink

52:45.460 --> 52:50.740
Because all of my money it goes to missiles and uh

52:52.180 --> 52:54.340
Researching cinnamon toast crunch

52:54.340 --> 53:00.100
See if we can find a weakness in in their plan

53:03.380 --> 53:07.460
Yeah, we had no money back then basically

53:09.220 --> 53:10.740
So you drink

53:10.740 --> 53:16.340
Yeah, yeah, and then and then the kids watch the parents drink and then the everybody drinks you just drink

53:18.900 --> 53:20.900
Something like that

53:20.900 --> 53:23.780
What was new zealand doing during the cold war?

53:26.100 --> 53:28.100
Hanging out

53:28.740 --> 53:34.420
Just being chill you guys don't have any missiles. Do you have any missiles you could blow anyone up with apparently back in the

53:34.820 --> 53:36.820
70s the joke was that

53:37.300 --> 53:40.900
Uh, there were four people unemployed in the country and the prime minister knew them all by name

53:42.580 --> 53:44.260
Apparently that's how it was

53:44.260 --> 53:48.340
There were four unemployed people in the country and the prime minister knew them all by name

53:48.340 --> 53:50.980
He's like, oh, yeah steve get a job steve

53:52.980 --> 53:54.980
He tried

53:55.220 --> 53:59.380
I brought me to staff fire. Oh, you're a fucking get a job toby

54:00.900 --> 54:02.900
I know your mother

54:03.300 --> 54:05.540
It's not it's not the country's problem

54:06.820 --> 54:08.580
You're lazy

54:08.580 --> 54:10.580
I've talked to your family

54:12.180 --> 54:14.180
I'm tired of pulling strings for you

54:15.380 --> 54:16.500
Yeah

54:16.500 --> 54:21.620
So, yeah, not quite the cold war but around that time and uh, just such infrastructure and things we built so

54:22.500 --> 54:24.260
That's awesome

54:24.260 --> 54:29.300
Could you could you swim to australia from from uh, new zealand me personally?

54:32.500 --> 54:38.180
Could anyone could a human being how big is it compared to like i think it's being done. I think it's being done. I'm not exactly sure

54:39.060 --> 54:41.380
Well, probably not probably not gonna be a lot of sharks

54:41.380 --> 54:47.220
No, I mean sharks would just eat you. They're too cold for sharks most of the time. Oh, yeah, but don't they do all that sort of stuff

54:47.620 --> 54:53.060
With the cages and boats and people swimming the english channel and stuff like that. Yeah, well the english channel. Yeah

54:53.060 --> 54:58.980
It's like it's it's just like it's just small enough that you can like set a record by doing some weird across it

55:00.740 --> 55:03.460
Like it's not no one would ever think about doing it, but you can do it

55:03.460 --> 55:07.940
I was wondering how that compares to probably a bit too far to go from new zealand to australia

55:07.940 --> 55:13.780
And it would be about two hours flying time. So it's probably too far. Yeah, that's a long

55:15.060 --> 55:17.460
That'd be like a day of swimming probably, right?

55:19.380 --> 55:23.380
All right, are there spiders in uh, russia new zealand

55:24.180 --> 55:26.180
spiders black widows

55:26.580 --> 55:28.740

55:28.740 --> 55:36.020
Um, not sure about black widows, but spiders are everywhere

55:38.340 --> 55:41.380

Thank you. Thank you Eugene and Matthew for our international guests

59:17.620 --> 59:20.340
You guys can you guys can take a seat unless there's anything that

59:20.980 --> 59:26.420
You you you you uh, you provided us with so much. Is there anything that while you're here you've traveled a long way

59:26.820 --> 59:32.340
Yeah, I traveled to ask you one question. Oh, yeah, god. I can't believe we almost lost you

59:32.340 --> 59:35.540
Um, yeah, yeah that slipped your mind

59:38.980 --> 59:45.220
All my belongings if I back I saw Joel McHale in an illegal bit tart. I made it here

59:46.340 --> 59:48.580
Uh, but then you did that rap and it was so funny and

59:50.180 --> 59:53.060
See you later. All right. What's your question? You have the floor?

59:54.900 --> 59:56.900
If you woke up

59:56.900 --> 01:00:03.060
On a on an island one day and all you had is a cloning machine of

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:07.300
That could make instant clones of yourself. What would we do?

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:35.460
It's not because among the possibilities and among some of the necessities are you might have to eat yourself

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.260
Uh

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.500
And you might want to fuck yourself

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:49.700
My rate too and any of yourselves might want to kill you for fucking and eating you

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.500
Uh

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:56.900
Is the are the clones do they have my mind to all my memories?

01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:00.260
Or are they just biologically me and they come out kind of like

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:04.740
New to the world and I get to teach them English or no, actually they uh

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:10.820
They're like complete uh corporate views and all my memories and so they just come out and go like oh, hey

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.420
I'm not a copy

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:17.940
Yeah, and there you go. Like yeah, you are you just came out of the copy machine

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:24.740
I'm like, okay. Well, so you needed a friend and I'm like, no, I'm hungry

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:33.540
Like you'd have to like, I mean, I'm assuming like you hide right by with a with a baseball bat

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:41.540
You just have this device like this two by four that would come down with a nail on it. You just make a mob grinder like a

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:47.620
Minecraft mob grinder. Yeah, just that you would hang the cloning machine over a pit of spikes

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.020
Just hang it hang it facing down

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.020
So that it is shot down

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.220
Like a kitchen faucet

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.940
And then there's two two early clones that you that you've

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.460
enslaved and hired to drag the corpses

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.500
And they know they get 20 of the corpses because you have

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.460
Pretended there's a bunch of you up there

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:19.860
By taking previous clones dead bodies and kind of puppeting them

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:24.340
And so they think there's a whole society up there and that they did something wrong

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:33.300
So and if they if they if they keep hauling corpses and cleaning and cooking them and passing the meat up through the dumb waiter

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.020
They get they get an arm

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.220
This is actually what that tv series the illusionist is about

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:52.820
Well, I mean can I ask what have you thought about this what you would do or is this such a question to make people sad?

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:59.780
Actually, I wanted to hear your version because I

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:12.580
Had something in on my mind like yes killing myself making a boat of my skin and bones. I went there

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:21.460
This is not the time or the place to judge people for the question is what would you do?

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.620
Not can you impress us with your lying?

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.620
Uh

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:35.700
Did you say you'd make weapons or clothes no boat boat boat boat. Oh up to get off the

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.820
Yeah

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.820
Meanwhile in portland and they're like

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:50.900
We got something out here and it's just this giant cured human flesh

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:53.940
cartilage crone and birdie and fucking

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:57.300
Vessel you're rowing a femur

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.700
My god, man

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:12.500
But but don't you think that you could make enough of you and then and then say huddle up everybody come on

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.780
We don't have any time you can get dressed in a second. Um

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:22.500
Here's the situation no food no water desert island just made a ton of mouths to feed

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:26.340
We got to split up. Let's fucking do this. Let's turn this place into miami

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:32.740
Like like get out there. I want to sharpen sharpen start sharpening sticks you hand the sharp sticks to him

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:38.340
You you get some wild boar. I want you to start punching grass and plants and see if any seeds come out that

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:42.420
Again, all my survivalist knowledge is based on minecraft

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:50.820
If you punch enough grass doesn't the seed come out that you can use to make food eventually punch one log then make a crafting table

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:54.260
But you could do you think or would that automatically?

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:59.780
It would be like no way because because the whole point of a biomass is that if it's gotten that big

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.020
It's because it was sustainable

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:06.420
Like there's no way you could drop 50 strangers on an island and expect

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:11.780
More than 20 of them to be alive three days later. Yeah, probably could you make 20?

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.620
Could you make like 20 of you and then be like, all right guys huddle up?

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:19.700
Listen, I know we don't have any food, but I'm gonna make one more of me and we're all gonna eat that one

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.300
Like

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.900
Would I feel like that could?

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:28.980
Yeah, that's a one-shot only like you make however many you make and then the cloning machine is broken or can you make?

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.100
food people

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.820
For lack of a better word

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:39.860
Actually, I thought about it like you can make as much as you like. Yeah

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:42.580
Oh, so you can eat a bunch of them. That's a meat machine

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:46.260
But I feel like I I would if I had a choice between

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:52.340
And I do in this hypothesis. I have a choice between making 20 of me and saying let's all

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:56.740
Let's all ritualistically eat into new people

01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:02.180
Who are no different from any of us except that they're 21st. Yeah

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:07.460
They're late. It's just bad for morale. It's just like like like everyone's at the table

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:11.620
I'm like, is there are you gonna finish that toe? Uh, and they're like, this is great

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:18.580
Me is great and and and everyone's like, yeah, we're so lucky to be given this bounty

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:22.900
What do you guys want to do tomorrow? Well, let's press the button again and

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:28.340
Do this again and everyone who just have this kind of podcast over them where they're like like, well

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:36.020
What's the point whereas if you just take take things in your own hands and are like, I'm I'm a I'm a maniac

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:40.500
I I control this machine. I'm gonna control the food chain

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:45.700
I'm gonna position myself as like a god and create a new civilization underneath me

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:51.700
In which I don't have so that I don't have to deal with the psychological ramifications of life and death

01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:54.020
I simply am somehow I'm past

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.180
Meat up

01:06:56.180 --> 01:07:00.100
Like it's already cooked even I can't even recognize it. I'll start to convince myself

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:05.620
I'll just I'll bury the lip of the machine so that all I do is hit a button and I forget

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:08.260
I slowly forget that it's me coming out of it

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:15.300
And I and I just like every day I go to like a bamboo cabinet and I open it and a fresh steaming pile of me is

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.860
It's been

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:21.060
Delicately prepared by the best chef version of me because it just

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:28.180
Because I'm just I'm I'm Sumner redstone like I'm just like I don't even touch the things I control like I'm just like

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:32.180
There's just layers of fucking like metropolises down there

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.180
You

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:38.420
Sorry, you just compared yourself to this CEO of Viacom

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:44.660
Well, I'm just saying like if you're like like like like those guys like those they don't even know I get it

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:49.300
I don't know what's happening on comedy central. I'm talking to vh1 today. But yeah, what you're saying is

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.180
I don't know. I I guess it's I guess that's me. I'm just pressing a button

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:58.580
Yeah, I buried my machine underground. You could easily just like forget about it. I I believe I would hope so in a way

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.900
We have all done this

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.540
That bamboo cabinet is called America

01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:09.620
That button's called your taxes

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.420
You're genius damn

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.660
Thank you Eugene congratulations and a successful pilgrimage

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.660
Oh

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:32.260
Everything all his steps in that backpack

01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:39.700
I I mean this isn't hilarious, but you guys didn't go with what I would have done

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:41.620
Which I don't even know if this is a good idea

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:45.940
But some species of ants have evolved a way of surviving floods

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.300
By which they all formed together in a giant ant ball

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:54.900
And they slowly spin the water each person gets a turn to breathe. I think I might do that

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:03.780
All right other spencers listen up for a little while you're gonna be underwater

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:07.220
It's gonna suck but then we're gonna rotate but guess what if this doesn't work

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.340
I'm leaving a retainer clone to try something else

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.180
It's really funny when you picture them all as spencers anyway

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:20.180
All right, there's one give up. Okay, so here's what it's here's how it's gonna be and they're already

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.420
I know we all like breathing. Uh-huh. Yeah, uh-huh. Okay. Yeah

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.300
and then

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:29.300
The shot of all of the

01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.940
Just completely solemn coming out of the

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:37.620
The diran diran rough boys video where they're like coming out of the water

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.500
Slash this water coming off the face like

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.500
Oh

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:47.860
And you leave behind one spencer who's on the shore like yeah, if this fucks up, I'll just make a bunch of new ones

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.260
We'll try plan bridge of humans

01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:57.380
That's what I thought you were gonna say that ants like they kill themselves and lay down across the water and then other ants walk

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:01.220
Across their ant ball requires no sacrifices my friends

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:08.420
Ant ball ant ball speaking of arthropods, uh, just I want to

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:13.060
I want to cycle back around to spiders real quick

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.900
If you put you know how like you can see cat's eyes glowing in the dark

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:21.780
Spiders eyes do that too to a lesser extent if you put in a light right by your eye

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.700
So it's like right in line with your eye

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:26.980
So like if you take your phone and have the phone flashlight right up to your eye

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:31.220
And you look out into the darkness like in a bush you can see these little tiny

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:38.580
They almost just look like glitter among the among the shadows and those are spiders eyes. How do you?

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:46.180
I listen to podcasts bro. I know all sorts of shit. Have you tested it? Yeah, it's terrifying

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.860
Like don't don't actually do it you'll shit

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.820
I know we were talking about spiders once

01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:04.100
I missed I missed it back then what do you think it what do you think it is about spiders that are so extra terrifying well humans actually

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.100
I actually the the racism

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:11.300
Psychologist that we talked to in Chicago was talking about humans actually have this evolutionary

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:17.060
Almost like a flashcard of snakes and spiders. That's like these are terrifying. Is it because they're venomous?

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:22.420
Yeah, probably just because stuff like that is a lot more instantaneous of a death

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.980
It's not like a coyote or something where you can learn tactics to combat it

01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:31.860
I think that's got it that that was a that was a smooth plug

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:36.820
Very subtle it's it's true though. It's like there's a lot of animals

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:43.220
We can't actually just you know combat, but you can't punch a spider if a spider bites you once you're you're potentially dead

01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:46.340
Yeah, I think that's that that probably is what it is for me

01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:51.460
If you like or if you live with poison inside of you that you can it'll leave your body

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:54.420
Like if I if I knew that I could

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:57.380
put this on something if I knew that I

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:03.140
Poison inside of me and I could just be like hey, fuck you like it like in a bar fight like fuck you man

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.740
Like that's crazy power

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:10.900
All I have is like my like impotent rage like that's not

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:15.220
That's not that's not terrifying. You would you you would use poison?

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:20.020
I don't know man. It's almost that's my girl. Whatever

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:28.980
You're gonna fucking step to me. I'm full of poison. I got a reserve of it

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.300
It lives in me if I'm mad enough

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.700
It's out. That's what it's for. Do you know if you would ever use it?

01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:39.380
I don't know. No, I well, I can't think of a situation in which I would

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:47.140
Use it recently. Well, you would have someone step to my girl. I think I think we all

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:54.260
Like you guys read aria in Hollywood you're dancing on a Saturday night with your girl like you are want to do and I know you

01:12:55.460 --> 01:13:03.220
You're you got a real wide collar unbuttoned to the chest. You're dancing a dude comes up to you. He pretends like you're not even there

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:08.900
He's getting all up on your girl. You're bride-to-be dog

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:16.820
Now mind you you've got a you've got a reserve of poison that venom is like ready to what happens

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:21.540
Do you just go like hey, man? Maybe maybe like just maybe just go to a different table or do you go?

01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.620
I just I wait well first I would go like oh

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:33.940
I better watch what erin does in the situation because this might be how I find out she doesn't love me

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:40.580
And then your poison stays put and you're just yeah, I mean why will far be it for me to poison this guy if he's he's he's

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:43.140
You know gonna be her new

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:45.780
New yeah, this is how they meet

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:50.420
I think that's what separates us from the snakes because snakes can't just like uber to carls jr. And like

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:56.180
You know got like a six dollar guacamole bacon burger go home

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.300
Well this venom would you be a bar rescue?

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.020
Would you be immune to your own venom?

01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:09.300
Oh, you have to be okay. So like you could go up to someone who's like eating a sandwich and just spit poison on it and feel like

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.860
Hey, man, that's gonna kill you. Can I have that?

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:18.100
It's just all the free food you could just ruin people's days

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:26.100
It's all about you stealing people's free sandwiches. Oh, I poisoned your slurpee, bro

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:32.340
Hey, you can't drink that can I have it? Yeah, but you you know technically you can do that with your regular spit

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:36.260
Or regular non-excreted poison

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.780
Yeah, hey, that's not gross to me man. Can I have that?

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:44.740
Well, I feel like if you're a venomous creature you might get more of a pass

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:50.900
You know, yeah, it's like if you spin something people would be like they'd punch you but not if you were a venomous creature

01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:54.900
But they still would they would punch you and like leave you at the side of like on a sidewalk

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:59.780
But they still wouldn't drink their slurpee. So you'd have a black eye, but then you'd also have like a large slurpee

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:06.500
With your name on it. Well, we just cut out the very complicated middleman of a very complex problem

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:13.700
So I'm glad did you see a hard target Jean-Claude Van Damme punches a snake in it

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.700
How does that go he grabs a snake?

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:23.860
It's gonna bite the woman and then he grabs it and then he holds it and he and the camera's over the snake's shoulder

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:27.460
As Jean-Claude Van Damme goes

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:30.660
And the snake passes out

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:33.940
He knocks it out

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:38.980
Like I gotta see it. I'm obsessed with the scene. Have you seen the beach with Leonardo DiCaprio?

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.460
No, he punches a shark in the face

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:46.660
And that and it's like the greatest thing I've ever seen because then there's a scene where he's telling

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:51.940
That story to a bunch of people on a beach as if as if they're like us watching the movie

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:57.220
And he's like and then I decided that I will not die tonight and everyone's like, yeah, I guess you punched a shark

01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:00.180
Like they're like sort of impressed

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:06.420
Is that the scene because I remember seeing the trailer where I just see Leo DiCaprio going like this in the trailer

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:13.380
Like is that him's just demonstrating like hallucinating that his life is like a video game. It's not the best movie

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:17.060
I gotta see this thing. Yeah, you should probably see it

01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:23.140
Isn't uh, what's his name from last action hero in that isn't there like an old crazy old man that's keeping him prisoner on the island or

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:28.260
Am I thinking of you might be thinking of last action hero or dr. Moreau or

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:32.420
Shutter island shutter. Well, not shutter island. I saw I saw that

01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:35.540
Shutter island little steaming little surprise

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.820
in the theater

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:43.140
They love that little revealing shutter. Has everyone seen shutter island?

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:49.460
Yeah, I don't I mean, it's like it's it's the world's worst crying game

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.460
Yeah

01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:54.020
I mean you would be you would

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:58.980
Yeah, are there are there movies that have a twist that big that make you go like

01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:03.700
I'm not like that you get really excited about because sometimes I just feel like I don't like the people are fucking with me

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:09.060
But maybe I'm just too fragile. I don't think that's I mean our brains and our bodies are six million years old

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:13.300
There's no there's no such thing as like a there's twists and storytelling

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:19.060
But you can't just say at the end of a campfire story, but by the way this whole time they were in a hat

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.620
They were all really tiny and you're like

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:30.820
Yeah, I like you just took you the whole time I was telling you that bruce willis was hanging out with this kid

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.380
Guess why you is a ghost?

01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:37.140
I didn't say anyone else could see him. What?

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:42.580
Check out a bunch of flashbacks motherfucker. What do you flashbacks? It's a campfire

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:48.420
Yeah, I think you gotta I mean so I mean make your movie however you want but

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.620
Shoo, I will

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:56.100
I'm gonna make my movie and there's gonna be so many twists gotta tell this old timer a story

01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.300
For instance horns

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:01.620
Did you watch horns? I just watched horns

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:06.820
I drove past the theater that was playing horns 10 times and I feel like if I did it one more time

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:11.300
I would have gone in because that poster of old cutie little Daniel Radcliffe with horns

01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:16.100
That's almost enough man. I don't even know what it's about. Why does he have horns? That's what it's about

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:22.100
Did he has horns? Yeah, and why and why yeah, did you see it? No

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.940
I watched it

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:31.540
What do you think? It's like, you know old crudité

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.340
because it's kind of

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:35.860
dry and

01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.860
ashy

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.860
I

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:43.860
Supposed to be good for me, but it's just like from Albertsons

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:47.780
Like

01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:52.740
Why are you trying to make me rethink how I think about morality when you don't even

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.780
Know what your movie's about

01:18:55.780 --> 01:19:03.780
Like why why are we going straight to me having my definitions of good and bad subverted if

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:08.580
Like, you know, you know, I hate when crudité makes me think that

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.260
I don't know. I'm too old

01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:16.180
I just I just watch these things now and I just I feel like just everyone's on my lawn

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.260
I just go like get off my lawn off my lawn

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:21.540
There's another movie to get off my lawn like I kind of like don't even consider

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:27.140
The their their goal to entertain me anymore. I got I just like go six dollars six dollars

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:32.100
Okay, what do we got here? What is this? He's fast. He's furious make up your mind

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:47.860
Like it's not for me and I kind of like therefore I'm kind of like it's like I actually don't I can't tell you in the old days

01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:51.860
Like eight years ago. I would have been like horns. I'll tell you what I thought about horns

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:59.060
I'd be like angry about it because underneath that anger would be some supposition that it's possible to make a good movie or that

01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:02.580
Or that or that, you know, like Robo cop was so great

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:06.820
Or you know, it's just like I'm just 41 and my back hurts and I'm kind of like I think all these movies suck

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:12.180
I think they've always sucked. I think everything has always sucked way more than we think like

01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:15.460
And you're just catching some sucky shit when you're in a good mood

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:18.500
You're you're like, I'm 11. Star Wars is amazing

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:21.860
I mean, honestly, like you're not wrong, but also

01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:28.020
Have you seen birdman? I haven't seen birdman. Yeah, I want to see that six people think it's dope

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:33.940
I saw the trailer for it and I was like, I don't think I'm gonna be able to handle watching that because it's just

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:38.900
Because Michael Keaton's too much for the average current movie going audience because he's too fucking good

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.300
It's too cool. He's back

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:45.060
If anyone if anyone in here doesn't think he's back

01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:52.900
Who honestly by I don't I'm sorry to do this by a show of applause if anyone doesn't think he's back

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:55.540
Speak now

01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:03.700
A weak applause that I will not dignify with a response. He's back. He's back. All right, Michael Keaton's back. He's back

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:10.100
I mean, it's just a real fucking treat to watch that guy for two hours after like a million years of not singing for two hours

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.740
You get you get him for two hours

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:17.540
I guess I have I guess I wasn't I didn't realize how that I hadn't seen Michael Keaton for a while

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:21.860
You you forget but then you see it in a movie theater and you realize like I've been watching a bunch of guys named

01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:24.340
White guys named chris for like the last 10 years

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:26.900
Who the fuck are these guys?

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:31.860
A bunch of chris is with like cool hair or not. Paul rogan rick rick philbs

01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like fripply cooper dude

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:40.740
Lauren burg north like oh my god. Lauren burg was really good flintoff effron zack bergen bergen bergen

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:45.540
A bunch of guys who have like cooler abs and they have faces and they like can't act their way out of a paper bag

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:49.860
And they're driving a cool car and you're like, I guess this is a cool movie. Fucking Keaton is here for you

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:52.580
here for you

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.740
And I'm not fucking around. It's like

01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:57.860
People think I'm joking

01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:02.420
Listen, listen, listen, listen, and I will I promise I'll shut up. It's your show. But guys

01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:06.180
Beedlejuice does not appear in his own movie

01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.980
for 50 minutes

01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:16.420
50 minutes into Beedlejuice. He shows up for real earlier in the movie. He's like on a commercial on a tiny tv. He's like

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:21.380
50 minutes he comes in for real and takes the movie over

01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:25.380
Nobody remembers that because he fucking owns it because he's Keaton

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.580
He's Keaton

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:30.580
Hey, I'll tell you something else

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:34.900
Gina Davis was an an an almost olympic archer

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.860
Did you know that? Oh, I know google it

01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:42.740
Davis almost was in the olympics as an archer. She was almost olympic as an archer

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:45.780
She was in Beedlejuice and she had a sitcom where she played the president

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.780
And I have no opinion about any of that stuff

01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.620
No, yeah, I don't think she's a good or bad person. I just think it's amazing

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:56.340
It was post post Gina Davis the actor

01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:01.460
Yep, Gina Davis might have been representing the United States as an archer at the olympics

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:04.900
That's impressive to me because like to be good at more than one thing

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.460
It really alludes me because I might be good at one thing

01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:13.460
Obviously, she's got to be a pretty shitty archer because how many people can possibly be trying out for that?

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:17.540
Since the invention of the gun

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:25.300
Hey, how many raise your hand if you can kill someone with a bow and arrow? See?

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.940
You could maim them like maybe draw a bunch of blood

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.540
You maim someone or you practiced archery?

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:43.300
I shot an arrow at a ren fair two years ago and I did not I did not come close to a target or I

01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.860
I shot at a bale of hay and I missed

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.140
So

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:52.500
All right, we don't have an ending for the show because it's not because Spencer is a bad person

01:23:55.860 --> 01:24:02.820
It's because we've grown over dependent on Dungeons and Dragons as a closer and yet the show has no structure anymore. There's no

01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:11.060
The like like jeff's been on sabbatical for so long and uh, you know to ask you to keep writing these d&d

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:16.820
Uh adventurettes. I mean I wrote them, but yeah, I mean it's tough

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:21.380
It's a tough ass, but the show is got a it's got a Dungeons and Dragons addiction

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:28.100
I mean we we don't know how else to to to end the show. I feel like I know how ladies and gentlemen michael keith

01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:36.820
Keep the applause. He's come check check. He's slower. It didn't work

01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:40.580
But but honestly what if

01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:45.460
What if it could happen man? It would blow minds and I know that

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.740
And that's amazing. That's only something keaton's back

01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:56.020
Keaton's back man. I'm sorry dan. No, it's all right. Okay. Well, so I mean you were talking a bunch of

01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:01.460
Where are you going with all that? No, I'm just some interesting talk. I'm just floundering. I'm just sharing my anxiety

01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:06.820
I don't I don't script this show. I don't know if I if I prepared things. Do you think I'd talk about my dog?

01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:12.580
Yeah, I think your dog is I'm not Bill Cosby. I haven't go. Oh my dog will be interesting

01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:15.140
I'll do a tight 20 about that and fuck Bill Cosby

01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:19.380
I don't know

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:24.420
Everybody look people are gonna start being okay when talking about fuck Bill Cosby

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:29.060
Yeah, I mean more than one person's weak applause

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:35.460
Yeah, people were way happier about Beetlejuice not showing up for 50 minutes and they were about talking about Bill Cosby

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:40.820
Nobody here knows him. He did it. Yeah, no, I mean, that's it

01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:44.100
You're all wrong. You're all wrong

01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:49.540
He's not actually your dad. He just played a dad on tv. It's okay. It's okay

01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:56.660
Hey, Danny did it. I know I know I know I remember we all know

01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:02.580
Let me let me let me just do it. Let me do a really sweet ass rap

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:08.500
Like like I won't but it doesn't necessarily it's not gonna close the show the rap. Just let me clear my head

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.580
but could it

01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.660
Sorry, sorry

01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:19.700
It's not my job. No, of course. My job is to flow to clear your head

01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:25.380
This is serious shit. I don't know what I'm doing up here. Dan Harmon motherfuckers
