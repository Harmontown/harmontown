Who is? Who's not?\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:36.000\nWhoever's just hanging out at your house.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:39.000\nGuess Comptroller, Dave Horowitz, everybody.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:44.000\nHi, guys.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:46.000\nI have a couple of things I can talk about,\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:50.000\nbut I do think that we should be prepared for a terrible show.\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:51.000\nNo, no.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:54.000\nI feel laconic. I feel neutral.\n\n00:54.000 --> 01:00.000\nThe pressures of nuptials, nuptial pressure?\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:01.000\nImpending nuptials, yes.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:03.000\nImpending nuptials?\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:05.000\nThe pressure of impending nuptials?\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:10.000\nThe pressure of impending nuptials, yeah.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:16.000\nYou compensate for them with a kind of dead calm, like you...\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:20.000\nBecause you don't want to be one of these people that's nervous about getting married,\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:21.000\nbecause that would be dumb.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:26.000\nYou'd be in a certs commercial or a Mentos commercial.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:30.000\nLooking for a quick fix because you blew a cufflink and then you put a Mentos on it.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:34.000\nWho cares? I'm cool. I live in LA.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:37.000\nJoel McCale's going to be at my wedding.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:40.000\nI'm not going to fucking put some pressure on it.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:43.000\nThe guy from the soup's going to be there.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:46.000\nHe's going to smell fear like a dog.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:49.000\nHe'll get up and start heckling me.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:53.000\nHe'll call me a Kardashian.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:57.000\nI've got to be cool, but nothing to do with that.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\nIt's obviously also the beginning of the second half.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:06.000\nThe second and probably last half of my life.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:08.000\nYou only get two.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:14.000\nWhen it comes to halves, you're guaranteed a maximum of two.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:24.000\nStarting the second half of your life, there is a subtle realization there that you are now officially dying.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:27.000\nAbsolutely more so than being born.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:30.000\nYou are now more dying.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:36.000\nBecause your next tasks include, for instance, helping someone else get born,\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:42.000\nand handing the reins off to him before your third heart attack proves\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:50.000\nto be irreconcilable, as the doctors might say in some strange universe where doctors are extra coy.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:54.000\nIt's a truly romantic way to think about marriage.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nReplication.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:02.000\nReplication, like the humble mosquito who lives its life,\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:07.000\nand then at the end of its full mosquito life, which I think probably spans a day,\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:12.000\nwe're always like, what are you doing? Who flies in a face like that?\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:18.000\nAnd the mosquito is like, this is it!\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nAnd we're just like, unbelievable, will you knock it off?\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:25.000\nThis is all I have!\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:30.000\nIt's comforting to think of things in those terms.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:42.000\nThis is it. I am about to lay eggs in a puddle outside your mailbox in some swampy land\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:51.000\nwhere hopefully a giant frog tongue won't rake across my deposits, rendering them pointless.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:54.000\nWhat's your frog tongue?\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nIt's Chevy Chase.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:01.000\nOh no! Does he know about the wedding?\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:03.000\nHe'll be back.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:07.000\nNo, I just thought that was a comedy brain thing.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:12.000\nWhat should I say there? What is my frog tongue?\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:16.000\nMy frog tongue is spiders. Motherfucker!\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:22.000\nOkay, so Erin came home and there's a black widow with a web on the stairs.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:26.000\nShe's taken pictures of it. She's like, oh, there's a black widow.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:33.000\nShe's got a blackated lower glass on its back. It was eating a caterpillar in the fucking thing\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:38.000\nbecause everything about them has to be so modeling and extreme.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:46.000\nIt couldn't just be eating a fly, it's eating a fucking beetle-butter fly.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:53.580\nI don't know why that's that's that's that's hoy-polloy shit. I'm only the fat of an unbaptized caterpillar\n\n04:55.540 --> 04:57.740\nWill quench this black widow's thirst\n\n04:59.140 --> 05:06.620\nYeah, it's sitting there. It's you know, do you just like watching it wriggle and it's a black widow and you know if they bite you\n\n05:08.980 --> 05:12.060\nYou know probably won't kill you, but if you're a small child or a lamb a\n\n05:12.060 --> 05:15.060\nA baby lamb\n\n05:18.780 --> 05:23.120\nIt'll take you out and when's the last time you went to work\n\n05:28.020 --> 05:30.660\nOn enough toxins to take out a baby lamb\n\n05:31.500 --> 05:33.500\nThat's gonna fuck up my shooting schedule\n\n05:34.220 --> 05:40.460\nWhich is which is a professional form of death black widows are dangerous. They're not brown look recluses, but they're dangerous\n\n05:40.460 --> 05:46.460\nI got off on a that was I don't know if you remember what with the point. Oh, that's my frogs tongue spiders, okay?\n\n05:47.900 --> 05:49.900\nOkay, so\n\n05:49.900 --> 05:54.220\nI was in the middle of something. What was it?

Oh\n\n10:46.140 --> 10:47.980\nThat's true\n\n10:47.980 --> 10:51.700\nThat's what someone told me when I told them I was from Boston and they they were from New York\n\n10:51.700 --> 10:55.700\nAnd they were like you don't live in a real city and I was like prove it like your whole\n\n10:55.700 --> 11:00.440\nCity could fit in my burrow. I was like cool Spike Lee\n\n11:02.220 --> 11:05.980\nLike I was saying they were like spike. It wasn't actually Spike Lee\n\n11:05.980 --> 11:12.180\nI heard a guy rapping once about how each of his fingers was a burrow and\n\n11:12.820 --> 11:17.580\nAnd so when he makes a fist he's got the whole he's got all of New York in the palm of his hand\n\n11:17.580 --> 11:20.580\nAnd I think it was Lloyd. What's his name? Lloyd Benson?\n\n11:20.580 --> 11:26.340\nLloyd Benz? Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber? Lloyd Benz?\n\n11:26.980 --> 11:35.900\nYeah, he said he goes.

It's not a tour\n\n18:53.540 --> 18:56.660\nBecause you're coming go leaving I would never consider that a tour. No\n\n18:56.660 --> 18:59.540\nNo, it's more of a trip\n\n19:01.700 --> 19:07.220\nUh, Spencer, do you like Busta Rhymes? Yeah, that was so great. It was it was\n\n19:08.340 --> 19:12.420\nI don't think Busta would be happy with that, but I was I was quite tickled\n\n19:16.500 --> 19:20.100\nHe wouldn't disagree that he says his own name at least 12 times the song he does\n\n19:20.820 --> 19:22.820\nIt's in his record contract\n\n19:22.820 --> 19:26.820\nWait, Dan, is this the song?\n\n19:37.620 --> 19:43.620\nDon't touch me throw the water on him. It's touch it remix. It can't be that hard to find it was it was\n\n19:43.620 --> 19:46.500\nquite a popular song among the hips and the hops\n\n19:46.500 --> 19:54.580\nIf it was touch it there's been remixes by everyone who's existed so it might be actually a bit hard to hone in on\n\n19:56.820 --> 20:01.620\nYou know you talked about that spider. What was the end of that spider story when we last left?\n\n20:01.620 --> 20:05.220\nIt's still existed in your house. What the fuck? Well, Aaron, it's not\n\n20:06.580 --> 20:12.980\nIt was out by the mailbox. Okay, still every time you're walking up those dark stairs to my mansion. Yeah\n\n20:12.980 --> 20:18.420\nYeah, now there's a new reason you could die other than just you'll fall and it's like\n\n20:19.300 --> 20:21.300\nCut yourself open on these sharpened\n\n20:22.340 --> 20:26.340\nDreamwork stairs. I always think about that those dreamwork stair impalements\n\n20:26.500 --> 20:27.700\nUm\n\n20:27.700 --> 20:32.340\nNow if you now you might fall down to the last thing you'll see as a spider going like oh my god\n\n20:32.420 --> 20:34.420\nIt's the biggest caterpillar ever\n\n20:34.420 --> 20:41.860\nUm, you don't want to kill it or anything Aaron takes care of that stuff. She's\n\n20:42.980 --> 20:46.020\nShe has a video of the spider and a video of her killing it\n\n20:46.580 --> 20:53.620\nUm, oh, she killed it. So then I came home. She killed it. Okay enclosure. Thank you. That's all I needed here\n\n20:54.740 --> 20:59.940\nSo I came home and I do a sweep with the flashlight now. I'm on the lookout for black widow. Sure\n\n21:01.140 --> 21:03.140\nand uh\n\n21:03.140 --> 21:09.620\nYou know and I find eight nine ten of them. Uh, like like like everywhere. Well because I don't know what they look like\n\n21:09.860 --> 21:11.860\nOh, oh, and so I'm\n\n21:13.860 --> 21:19.380\nAll spiders are now black widows and I'm like I because I'm not gonna look for the hourglass and some of them are small\n\n21:19.460 --> 21:21.460\nAnd I'm like, there's black widows everywhere\n\n21:22.020 --> 21:27.780\nWe should call a service of some kind and then Aaron was like those aren't black widows. That's not a release\n\n21:27.860 --> 21:32.180\nIt's not a story. I like it though. I just am glad that they she killed it\n\n21:32.180 --> 21:36.900\nI mean, I don't hate spiders, but I when it's a black widow. I mean, that's jeez\n\n21:36.980 --> 21:39.300\nYou don't want to you don't want to tangle with that sort of thing\n\n21:39.460 --> 21:45.940\nHere's the weird thing about Aaron or not weird at all really if you know her personality like when there's a spider on the wall\n\n21:46.260 --> 21:48.260\nin the root in the house\n\n21:48.260 --> 21:54.500\nUm, like I I just go like, okay. I'll if I have to I'll just I'll find something and I'll kill it\n\n21:54.500 --> 22:01.860\nI'm superstitious about it for some dumb reason. Um, that's a classic superstition. I know it's so stupid. But but\n\n22:02.100 --> 22:07.300\nLike before I'll do that Aaron. I'll be like, I'll take care of it. But Aaron will just like she I don't\n\n22:07.300 --> 22:09.860\nSo there's some people who are like really good with spiders\n\n22:10.500 --> 22:14.980\nAnd then there's some people who are terrified of them. Aaron just I always she just\n\n22:15.220 --> 22:22.660\nIf I describe her behavior to you like like you wouldn't know which one she was because she just she'll take like a coat hanger and just poke at it\n\n22:22.660 --> 22:26.020\nLike and then although like like I don't even know what she's trying to do\n\n22:26.020 --> 22:29.300\nJust agitate it and I'll go like why what are you trying to do?\n\n22:29.300 --> 22:33.780\nNo, just and then she's like poking it and then the spider like fall\n\n22:34.100 --> 22:36.100\nUnder the floor and then she'll go\n\n22:36.100 --> 22:38.100\nAh\n\n22:38.100 --> 22:40.100\nWhat are you doing?\n\n22:40.100 --> 22:46.820\nI don't I don't what was the attempt like she wanted it to crawl onto the coat hanger and she was gonna be like, uh\n\n22:47.380 --> 22:50.580\ngentle gentle bend or what what's a\n\n22:50.580 --> 22:58.260\nGentle bend or what's a uh, uh, it's gentle bend. Yeah, we all know. No, who is uh, Dan Haggerty played him and gentle bend\n\n22:58.900 --> 23:02.420\nNo, no, no grizzly grizzly Adams grizzly Adams\n\n23:06.660 --> 23:12.180\nI like gentle bend. I think who's gentle is gentle bend was the name of the bear in grizzly Adams. I think\n\n23:12.820 --> 23:14.820\nI thought he just called him Ben\n\n23:15.380 --> 23:17.540\nGrizzly Adams was a show in the 70s\n\n23:17.540 --> 23:21.060\nThis is this is how little you could take your business elsewhere a network tv\n\n23:21.300 --> 23:26.260\nI grizzly Adams was just a guy that lived in the woods and that is it\n\n23:27.860 --> 23:34.340\nHe he wasn't wanted for a murder. He hadn't committed. He wasn't a counterfeiter. He wasn't he couldn't turn into a snake\n\n23:34.740 --> 23:35.860\nhe\n\n23:35.860 --> 23:38.980\nHis parents weren't vampires. He didn't he didn't go on dates\n\n23:39.220 --> 23:41.220\nHe sat in a fucking cabin\n\n23:41.220 --> 23:47.940\nAnd he had a beard and he hung out and it was like I guess the other two networks had news on or something\n\n23:48.900 --> 23:54.420\nDid they make a lot of episodes? Yeah, I think it was on all the time. Like I'm it's it's burnt into my memory\n\n23:54.500 --> 23:58.740\nAnd he had obviously friends who also lived in the woods. There was a guy that was like a prospector\n\n23:59.300 --> 23:59.940\nSure\n\n23:59.940 --> 24:03.780\nWho had a mule and he would walk around up on the hills and he was like very cranky\n\n24:04.420 --> 24:07.620\nand then so then grizzly Adams was like a kind of cool like\n\n24:07.620 --> 24:10.420\nNights in white satin kind of shirt\n\n24:11.460 --> 24:15.380\nBut he would cut cut his own wood and he had a big beard and long hair and he would he would just go like\n\n24:15.700 --> 24:18.180\nHey, cranky cranky tom, whatever the guy's name was\n\n24:18.820 --> 24:24.180\nDon't be so mean like like he just he just lived in the woods and it sounds like a children's show the way I'm describing it\n\n24:24.260 --> 24:27.300\nIt sounds like they would like play on a loop in a museum or something\n\n24:29.300 --> 24:33.140\nYeah, it sounds like something that will inevitably teach you about weights and measures or something\n\n24:33.140 --> 24:39.460\nYeah, it's some Canadian you stick around long enough. There's like a teaching moment about splitting wood and angles and stuff\n\n24:40.020 --> 24:43.140\nAll right, so I want to address some concerns about my dog. Oh\n\n24:44.820 --> 24:46.820\num, so, uh\n\n24:47.140 --> 24:52.980\nI don't and I don't know how much of this I have explained at the show yet, but I know like like the uh, the new tv's\n\n24:54.340 --> 24:56.340\nThe dogs can see them\n\n24:57.460 --> 24:59.220\nThey're watching what we watch now\n\n24:59.220 --> 25:04.100\nThere are eyes and our eyes are seeing the same thing because the tv's are different now\n\n25:05.060 --> 25:06.260\nI'm telling you\n\n25:06.260 --> 25:07.460\nyou're right\n\n25:07.460 --> 25:13.620\nAnd uh harvey if there's ever a uh dog or a squirrel or a cat or and he'll react to each one\n\n25:14.260 --> 25:17.060\ndifferently or a deer, but like not a\n\n25:17.940 --> 25:24.420\nCockroach like like he won't he she differentiates it if it's like a cartoon cat.

He there's that bag in the plant\n\n29:32.420 --> 29:34.420\nHe's way too smart\n\n29:34.580 --> 29:37.460\nThere's there have been times and like, you know, so I'm a\n\n29:38.500 --> 29:41.140\nI I've never had a pet in my whole life\n\n29:41.540 --> 29:47.380\nAnd that's too long because I'm like a gross dog person like not gross but like I'm I love dogs the most\n\n29:48.020 --> 29:49.380\nand I've\n\n29:49.380 --> 29:51.380\nI think Harvey's my friend so\n\n29:51.940 --> 29:53.460\nwe have like a\n\n29:53.460 --> 29:56.180\nWe're friends, but every there are times when I will look at him\n\n29:56.580 --> 30:01.700\nAnd I will think that there's a man in a dog suit because he's his eyes are too expressive\n\n30:01.780 --> 30:05.460\nHe has those weird those whites of his eyes. So is there any ways and it's back and opens the bow?\n\n30:06.180 --> 30:08.180\nYeah\n\n30:08.180 --> 30:10.820\nIt just looks like a dude like you expect me to be like, hey\n\n30:11.380 --> 30:13.380\nLike if you're rubbing his belly, he's like\n\n30:13.380 --> 30:19.060\nHey, man a little if you said like a little to the left I would I would freak out but not as much as if another dog\n\n30:19.060 --> 30:20.580\nYou'd be like, oh, yeah, okay\n\n30:20.580 --> 30:22.260\nWhat?\n\n30:22.260 --> 30:26.260\nHe sleeps in between me and Aaron like a like an eight-year-old boy\n\n30:30.020 --> 30:32.020\nWait what?\n\n30:33.620 --> 30:35.620\nYou know\n\n30:35.780 --> 30:40.580\nLike before when you got a caught uh, when you got a dog when you hired that eight-year-old boy to sleep with you\n\n30:40.580 --> 30:55.700\nHe sleeps right in the eight-year-old boy spot on my bed. I had uh, there was uh, there was something else\n\n30:55.940 --> 31:01.700\nI felt like there was something else. Oh, can we hey, can we can we tee up at least just so it's at the ready?\n\n31:01.700 --> 31:09.220\nJust like a like a like a just a kind of a laid-back rap beat\n\n31:12.020 --> 31:14.020\nOh\n\n31:15.780 --> 31:18.500\nNice nice control because I feel like it's thank you\n\n31:19.540 --> 31:21.540\nIt's a lazy show and a\n\n31:22.100 --> 31:25.380\nAnd I wanted to try to embrace that and turn it into entertainment\n\n31:26.180 --> 31:30.100\nAnd get myself a little excited because you can you can tell I'm phoning it in\n\n31:30.100 --> 31:33.060\nI can't.

He's okay. He's\n\n35:27.060 --> 35:30.420\nThis games are just shitty and\n\n35:31.140 --> 35:32.500\nHe's\n\n35:32.500 --> 35:39.460\nDon't like to be here and he made the final guy who wears all jackets in a layer at\n\n35:40.340 --> 35:42.340\nI don't know how\n\n35:42.900 --> 35:50.340\nSo Joe mackerel was on a show that you yeah, basically, uh, Joe mackerel.

So you googled community\n\n36:08.980 --> 36:10.500\nI\n\n36:10.500 --> 36:14.660\nNot when you knew the guy, but he's looked nice and oh\n\n36:15.940 --> 36:19.460\nHow did you first how did you first come upon Joe mackerel?\n\n36:19.460 --> 36:21.460\nOh\n\n36:24.100 --> 36:26.820\nJust watching tv in russia.

I started at the first\n\n37:06.180 --> 37:08.580\nNot season episode session\n\n37:09.780 --> 37:12.740\nAnd uh, I listened through all\n\n37:13.460 --> 37:14.980\nthese series\n\n37:14.980 --> 37:16.980\nand\n\n37:17.220 --> 37:19.220\nWho's\n\n37:29.220 --> 37:31.220\nThis is real is that real\n\n37:33.140 --> 37:35.140\nThat was so flawless\n\n37:36.020 --> 37:40.180\nI at this point you could be a highly trained upright citizens brigade\n\n37:42.020 --> 37:44.020\nPractical joke\n\n37:44.020 --> 37:46.020\nYou\n\n37:46.020 --> 37:53.220\nI just googled him and uh, there's a guy that plays in seven private ryan's\n\n37:54.580 --> 37:56.580\nju guy\n\n37:57.460 --> 38:00.740\nBut uh, oh you found the wrong adam gulberg. Yeah, the days\n\n38:06.340 --> 38:10.340\nYeah, uh, is adam here are you here adam?\n\n38:10.340 --> 38:12.340\nI\n\n38:12.340 --> 38:15.460\nI bet we thought we'd never hear you say those words\n\n38:16.980 --> 38:19.860\nUh adam, do you want to come up and meet this?\n\n38:20.740 --> 38:25.940\nThis guy's this guy's traveled the globe. I mean not to meet you, but he's just curious about you\n\n38:26.340 --> 38:28.820\nI'd hope not. How's it going? This is adam gulberg. How's it going?\n\n38:30.020 --> 38:34.980\nI got you a wedding thing for Aaron. It's ace of spies. It's a game fun\n\n38:35.860 --> 38:39.700\nWhat should I get dan for his wedding? Well, I don't know. Are you on the clock?\n\n38:39.700 --> 38:41.700\nWhat's another game?\n\n38:42.580 --> 38:45.140\nShadowrun I'm gonna get dan shadowrun for as well\n\n38:46.500 --> 38:52.500\nThanks for helping me figure that out for my wedding if you get yourself shadowrun and then you we start to play in the new\n\n38:52.580 --> 38:57.460\nYear, we'll play shadowrun on the podcast. I feel like it'd just be easier if I got you shadowrun\n\n38:58.340 --> 39:03.780\nAnd then I have to game master. I don't know. I just you know, that's the end of it if I just gave it to you\n\n39:05.860 --> 39:07.860\nThank you adam\n\n39:07.860 --> 39:13.860\nUh, so you came here with all why do you have all your money with you? That's the mystery here, right?\n\n39:15.300 --> 39:18.980\nWell, when you leave russia, you don't just leave stuff in russia. They have bank\n\n39:21.700 --> 39:25.620\nBanks are capitalists. They just have a big pile of their stuff in the center of the\n\n39:25.620 --> 39:39.380\nI'm kidding. I it's not true. They they they converted to capitalism\n\n39:39.380 --> 39:45.060\nOur currency is falling down rising up in some other way like\n\n39:46.420 --> 39:48.900\nYeah, even the currency is rising up. Yeah\n\n39:50.340 --> 39:52.340\nWell, who's ain't brother\n\n39:52.340 --> 39:57.860\nWe got to go to that bitcoin business. We got to we got to we got to do some kind of google money now\n\n39:58.020 --> 40:00.660\nWhat if you can mine bitcoins in minecraft?\n\n40:03.380 --> 40:05.380\nDid I just make a million dollars?\n\n40:06.420 --> 40:08.580\nSpencer you got to go you got to get out of here, man\n\n40:09.300 --> 40:12.580\nYou got to get out of here right now. I just start running like I have the golden ticket\n\n40:13.780 --> 40:15.780\nOut of my way\n\n40:16.820 --> 40:19.460\nI watched that bitcoin documentary and still don't understand it\n\n40:19.460 --> 40:22.820\nBut what I do understand is that it is inevitable. It may not be bitcoin\n\n40:22.820 --> 40:27.540\nBut obviously we have to go to some kind of peer-to-peer currency, right? Well, haven't I explained this to you dan?\n\n40:28.020 --> 40:30.820\nIt's a cash register full of math. Yes. Yes\n\n40:32.100 --> 40:38.180\nThe way I always so simple the way I always heard bitcoin was if I gave you a davin buster's dollar\n\n40:38.500 --> 40:42.180\nFor every hour you spent idling your car. It's like that. Yes\n\n40:42.500 --> 40:46.660\nThat's how much that's how much the money is worth and how much electricity it actually costs to make\n\n40:46.660 --> 40:49.620\nWell electricity who cares? Yeah, it's\n\n40:54.260 --> 40:58.100\nYeah, well, I think at this point after watching this documentary\n\n40:58.260 --> 41:02.420\nI think that any arguments for or against bitcoin are kind of point\n\n41:02.980 --> 41:05.940\nIt's sort of actually mute the larger conversation\n\n41:06.340 --> 41:10.100\nOr realization should be that like mp3 technology\n\n41:10.100 --> 41:17.140\nThere is really nothing that's going to stop the nations of the world from inevitably if we if we continue to exchange\n\n41:17.700 --> 41:21.140\nAny kind of currency it's going to have to become a\n\n41:21.940 --> 41:26.820\nGlobal kind of peer-to-peer currency. There is no it's not because we're anarchists\n\n41:26.900 --> 41:31.940\nIt's because the governments will not be able to sustain themselves while trying to endorse\n\n41:32.580 --> 41:37.220\nDifferent kinds of currency. They will one by one become incompatible with something that spreads\n\n41:37.220 --> 41:42.420\nI bet adam disagrees with that. I would I guess I you know me. Well, um\n\n41:42.740 --> 41:48.900\nThe thing about having a universal currency. It's a really big staple of sci-fi even in shadow run\n\n41:49.460 --> 41:50.660\nbut\n\n41:50.660 --> 41:57.460\nThe ability to issue debt from huge nations to huge nations means that having the yen and having the dollar be different things\n\n41:57.860 --> 42:01.940\nIs really really useful. Well, if everything is like future bucks\n\n42:01.940 --> 42:09.700\nThen japan can't control their exports and imports or set taxes that say this is valued internally as a currency\n\n42:09.940 --> 42:11.940\nAnd this is worth less as we export it\n\n42:12.180 --> 42:18.340\nI I hear you there definitely agree that's that's that I mean in that I don't understand that shit at all\n\n42:20.500 --> 42:27.060\nAnd therefore I definitely readily accept that it's impossible to take but but there's a difference between saying universal\n\n42:27.060 --> 42:34.100\nCurrency and peer-to-peer currency. What's the difference between a dollar and a bitcoin right now in terms of me being able to send it to you\n\n42:34.100 --> 42:37.700\nAnd you being able to send it to me. Hopefully in a large amount\n\n42:38.260 --> 42:40.260\nThere's a cash register made of math\n\n42:42.020 --> 42:45.620\nA cash register is made of math it takes one and then it turns it into\n\n42:46.180 --> 42:50.980\n100 of something else that's dollars and pennies. Yeah, that's a cash register\n\n42:51.780 --> 42:55.060\nThis is the most thrilling thing we should go back to talking about your dog who is so cute\n\n42:55.060 --> 42:57.060\nYou\n\n42:58.100 --> 43:01.700\nIs it undignified or or embarrassing to admit?\n\n43:04.100 --> 43:07.460\nIn my position or not that I don't understand anything you guys are talking about\n\n43:08.180 --> 43:13.780\nI'd say that's uh, that's a winning statement right there. A lot of people are on your side. I'm not trying. Yeah\n\n43:13.780 --> 43:16.260\nI mean if you don't yeah, okay, so a couple of people\n\n43:16.900 --> 43:21.140\nAlso don't good. That's cool. Do you guys did you guys see interstellar because I didn't\n\n43:21.140 --> 43:23.140\nI\n\n43:23.140 --> 43:28.340\nThat's a that's a movie you could see everywhere. Yeah, no, I don't I don't understand anything\n\n43:28.580 --> 43:31.540\nNot only do I not understand bitcoin. I don't understand the actual\n\n43:31.940 --> 43:36.420\nAmerican dollar or any kind anything about economics worldwide. Okay, good\n\n43:37.620 --> 43:46.820\nThe the thing that felt clear to me watching watching this documentary is that technology is going to affect currency as surely as it has affected culture\n\n43:46.820 --> 43:54.100\nUh media of exchange like ideas the way that we shoot things edit things record things\n\n43:54.500 --> 44:01.540\nThey become peer to peer over time. Uh, they they transcend things as relatively\n\n44:03.460 --> 44:10.820\nVestigial as what country you live in over time. It just and it just seems like a safe enough bet\n\n44:10.820 --> 44:16.660\nI don't know but there's nothing there's no risk at that bet because it's either 50 years or 500 years or five years from now\n\n44:16.660 --> 44:21.940\nAnd I don't know which it is but but we are we are tending toward we are gonna end up\n\n44:22.740 --> 44:26.980\nNot like going.

You have the floor?\n\n59:54.900 --> 59:56.900\nIf you woke up\n\n59:56.900 --> 01:00:03.060\nOn a on an island one day and all you had is a cloning machine of\n\n01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:07.300\nThat could make instant clones of yourself. What would we do?\n\n01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:35.460\nIt's not because among the possibilities and among some of the necessities are you might have to eat yourself\n\n01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.260\nUh\n\n01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.500\nAnd you might want to fuck yourself\n\n01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:49.700\nMy rate too and any of yourselves might want to kill you for fucking and eating you\n\n01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.500\nUh\n\n01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:56.900\nIs the are the clones do they have my mind to all my memories?\n\n01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:00.260\nOr are they just biologically me and they come out kind of like\n\n01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:04.740\nNew to the world and I get to teach them English or no, actually they uh\n\n01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:10.820\nThey're like complete uh corporate views and all my memories and so they just come out and go like oh, hey\n\n01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.420\nI'm not a copy\n\n01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:17.940\nYeah, and there you go. Like yeah, you are you just came out of the copy machine\n\n01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:24.740\nI'm like, okay. Well, so you needed a friend and I'm like, no, I'm hungry\n\n01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:33.540\nLike you'd have to like, I mean, I'm assuming like you hide right by with a with a baseball bat\n\n01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:41.540\nYou just have this device like this two by four that would come down with a nail on it. You just make a mob grinder like a\n\n01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:47.620\nMinecraft mob grinder. Yeah, just that you would hang the cloning machine over a pit of spikes\n\n01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.020\nJust hang it hang it facing down\n\n01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.020\nSo that it is shot down\n\n01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.220\nLike a kitchen faucet\n\n01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.940\nAnd then there's two two early clones that you that you've\n\n01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.460\nenslaved and hired to drag the corpses\n\n01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.500\nAnd they know they get 20 of the corpses because you have\n\n01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.460\nPretended there's a bunch of you up there\n\n01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:19.860\nBy taking previous clones dead bodies and kind of puppeting them\n\n01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:24.340\nAnd so they think there's a whole society up there and that they did something wrong\n\n01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:33.300\nSo and if they if they if they keep hauling corpses and cleaning and cooking them and passing the meat up through the dumb waiter\n\n01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.020\nThey get they get an arm\n\n01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.220\nThis is actually what that tv series the illusionist is about\n\n01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:52.820\nWell, I mean can I ask what have you thought about this what you would do or is this such a question to make people sad?\n\n01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:59.780\nActually, I wanted to hear your version because I\n\n01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:12.580\nHad something in on my mind like yes killing myself making a boat of my skin and bones. I went there\n\n01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:21.460\nThis is not the time or the place to judge people for the question is what would you do?\n\n01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.620\nNot can you impress us with your lying?\n\n01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.620\nUh\n\n01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:35.700\nDid you say you'd make weapons or clothes no boat boat boat boat. Oh up to get off the\n\n01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.820\nYeah\n\n01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.820\nMeanwhile in portland and they're like\n\n01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:50.900\nWe got something out here and it's just this giant cured human flesh\n\n01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:53.940\ncartilage crone and birdie and fucking\n\n01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:57.300\nVessel you're rowing a femur\n\n01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.700\nMy god, man\n\n01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:12.500\nBut but don't you think that you could make enough of you and then and then say huddle up everybody come on\n\n01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.780\nWe don't have any time you can get dressed in a second. Um\n\n01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:22.500\nHere's the situation no food no water desert island just made a ton of mouths to feed\n\n01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:26.340\nWe got to split up. Let's fucking do this. Let's turn this place into miami\n\n01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:32.740\nLike like get out there. I want to sharpen sharpen start sharpening sticks you hand the sharp sticks to him\n\n01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:38.340\nYou you get some wild boar. I want you to start punching grass and plants and see if any seeds come out that\n\n01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:42.420\nAgain, all my survivalist knowledge is based on minecraft\n\n01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:50.820\nIf you punch enough grass doesn't the seed come out that you can use to make food eventually punch one log then make a crafting table\n\n01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:54.260\nBut you could do you think or would that automatically?\n\n01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:59.780\nIt would be like no way because because the whole point of a biomass is that if it's gotten that big\n\n01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.020\nIt's because it was sustainable\n\n01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:06.420\nLike there's no way you could drop 50 strangers on an island and expect\n\n01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:11.780\nMore than 20 of them to be alive three days later. Yeah, probably could you make 20?\n\n01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.620\nCould you make like 20 of you and then be like, all right guys huddle up?\n\n01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:19.700\nListen, I know we don't have any food, but I'm gonna make one more of me and we're all gonna eat that one\n\n01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.300\nLike\n\n01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.900\nWould I feel like that could?\n\n01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:28.980\nYeah, that's a one-shot only like you make however many you make and then the cloning machine is broken or can you make?\n\n01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.100\nfood people\n\n01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.820\nFor lack of a better word\n\n01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:39.860\nActually, I thought about it like you can make as much as you like. Yeah\n\n01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:42.580\nOh, so you can eat a bunch of them. That's a meat machine\n\n01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:46.260\nBut I feel like I I would if I had a choice between\n\n01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:52.340\nAnd I do in this hypothesis. I have a choice between making 20 of me and saying let's all\n\n01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:56.740\nLet's all ritualistically eat into new people\n\n01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:02.180\nWho are no different from any of us except that they're 21st. Yeah\n\n01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:07.460\nThey're late. It's just bad for morale. It's just like like like everyone's at the table\n\n01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:11.620\nI'm like, is there are you gonna finish that toe? Uh, and they're like, this is great\n\n01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:18.580\nMe is great and and and everyone's like, yeah, we're so lucky to be given this bounty\n\n01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:22.900\nWhat do you guys want to do tomorrow? Well, let's press the button again and\n\n01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:28.340\nDo this again and everyone who just have this kind of podcast over them where they're like like, well\n\n01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:36.020\nWhat's the point whereas if you just take take things in your own hands and are like, I'm I'm a I'm a maniac\n\n01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:40.500\nI I control this machine. I'm gonna control the food chain\n\n01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:45.700\nI'm gonna position myself as like a god and create a new civilization underneath me\n\n01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:51.700\nIn which I don't have so that I don't have to deal with the psychological ramifications of life and death\n\n01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:54.020\nI simply am somehow I'm past\n\n01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.180\nMeat up\n\n01:06:56.180 --> 01:07:00.100\nLike it's already cooked even I can't even recognize it. I'll start to convince myself\n\n01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:05.620\nI'll just I'll bury the lip of the machine so that all I do is hit a button and I forget\n\n01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:08.260\nI slowly forget that it's me coming out of it\n\n01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:15.300\nAnd I and I just like every day I go to like a bamboo cabinet and I open it and a fresh steaming pile of me is\n\n01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.860\nIt's been\n\n01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:21.060\nDelicately prepared by the best chef version of me because it just\n\n01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:28.180\nBecause I'm just I'm I'm Sumner redstone like I'm just like I don't even touch the things I control like I'm just like\n\n01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:32.180\nThere's just layers of fucking like metropolises down there\n\n01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.180\nYou\n\n01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:38.420\nSorry, you just compared yourself to this CEO of Viacom\n\n01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:44.660\nWell, I'm just saying like if you're like like like like those guys like those they don't even know I get it\n\n01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:49.300\nI don't know what's happening on comedy central. I'm talking to vh1 today. But yeah, what you're saying is\n\n01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.180\nI don't know. I I guess it's I guess that's me. I'm just pressing a button\n\n01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:58.580\nYeah, I buried my machine underground. You could easily just like forget about it. I I believe I would hope so in a way\n\n01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.900\nWe have all done this\n\n01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.540\nThat bamboo cabinet is called America\n\n01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:09.620\nThat button's called your taxes\n\n01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.420\nYou're genius damn\n\n01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.660\nThank you Eugene congratulations and a successful pilgrimage\n\n01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.660\nOh\n\n01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:32.260\nEverything all his steps in that backpack\n\n01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:39.700\nI I mean this isn't hilarious, but you guys didn't go with what I would have done\n\n01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:41.620\nWhich I don't even know if this is a good idea\n\n01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:45.940\nBut some species of ants have evolved a way of surviving floods\n\n01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.300\nBy which they all formed together in a giant ant ball\n\n01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:54.900\nAnd they slowly spin the water each person gets a turn to breathe. I think I might do that\n\n01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:03.780\nAll right other spencers listen up for a little while you're gonna be underwater\n\n01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:07.220\nIt's gonna suck but then we're gonna rotate but guess what if this doesn't work\n\n01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.340\nI'm leaving a retainer clone to try something else\n\n01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.180\nIt's really funny when you picture them all as spencers anyway\n\n01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:20.180\nAll right, there's one give up. Okay, so here's what it's here's how it's gonna be and they're already\n\n01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.420\nI know we all like breathing. Uh-huh. Yeah, uh-huh. Okay. Yeah\n\n01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.300\nand then\n\n01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:29.300\nThe shot of all of the\n\n01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.940\nJust completely solemn coming out of the\n\n01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:37.620\nThe diran diran rough boys video where they're like coming out of the water\n\n01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.500\nSlash this water coming off the face like\n\n01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.500\nOh\n\n01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:47.860\nAnd you leave behind one spencer who's on the shore like yeah, if this fucks up, I'll just make a bunch of new ones\n\n01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.260\nWe'll try plan bridge of humans\n\n01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:57.380\nThat's what I thought you were gonna say that ants like they kill themselves and lay down across the water and then other ants walk\n\n01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:01.220\nAcross their ant ball requires no sacrifices my friends\n\n01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:08.420\nAnt ball ant ball speaking of arthropods, uh, just I want to\n\n01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:13.060\nI want to cycle back around to spiders real quick\n\n01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.900\nIf you put you know how like you can see cat's eyes glowing in the dark\n\n01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:21.780\nSpiders eyes do that too to a lesser extent if you put in a light right by your eye\n\n01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.700\nSo it's like right in line with your eye\n\n01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:26.980\nSo like if you take your phone and have the phone flashlight right up to your eye\n\n01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:31.220\nAnd you look out into the darkness like in a bush you can see these little tiny\n\n01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:38.580\nThey almost just look like glitter among the among the shadows and those are spiders eyes. How do you?\n\n01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:46.180\nI listen to podcasts bro. I know all sorts of shit. Have you tested it? Yeah, it's terrifying\n\n01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.860\nLike don't don't actually do it you'll shit\n\n01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.820\nI know we were talking about spiders once\n\n01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:04.100\nI missed I missed it back then what do you think it what do you think it is about spiders that are so extra terrifying well humans actually\n\n01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.100\nI actually the the racism\n\n01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:11.300\nPsychologist that we talked to in Chicago was talking about humans actually have this evolutionary\n\n01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:17.060\nAlmost like a flashcard of snakes and spiders. That's like these are terrifying. Is it because they're venomous?\n\n01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:22.420\nYeah, probably just because stuff like that is a lot more instantaneous of a death\n\n01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.980\nIt's not like a coyote or something where you can learn tactics to combat it\n\n01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:31.860\nI think that's got it that that was a that was a smooth plug\n\n01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:36.820\nVery subtle it's it's true though. It's like there's a lot of animals\n\n01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:43.220\nWe can't actually just you know combat, but you can't punch a spider if a spider bites you once you're you're potentially dead\n\n01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:46.340\nYeah, I think that's that that probably is what it is for me\n\n01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:51.460\nIf you like or if you live with poison inside of you that you can it'll leave your body\n\n01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:54.420\nLike if I if I knew that I could\n\n01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:57.380\nput this on something if I knew that I\n\n01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:03.140\nPoison inside of me and I could just be like hey, fuck you like it like in a bar fight like fuck you man\n\n01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.740\nLike that's crazy power\n\n01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:10.900\nAll I have is like my like impotent rage like that's not\n\n01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:15.220\nThat's not that's not terrifying. You would you you would use poison?\n\n01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:20.020\nI don't know man. It's almost that's my girl. Whatever\n\n01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:28.980\nYou're gonna fucking step to me. I'm full of poison. I got a reserve of it\n\n01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.300\nIt lives in me if I'm mad enough\n\n01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.700\nIt's out. That's what it's for. Do you know if you would ever use it?\n\n01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:39.380\nI don't know. No, I well, I can't think of a situation in which I would\n\n01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:47.140\nUse it recently. Well, you would have someone step to my girl. I think I think we all\n\n01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:54.260\nLike you guys read aria in Hollywood you're dancing on a Saturday night with your girl like you are want to do and I know you\n\n01:12:55.460 --> 01:13:03.220\nYou're you got a real wide collar unbuttoned to the chest. You're dancing a dude comes up to you. He pretends like you're not even there\n\n01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:08.900\nHe's getting all up on your girl. You're bride-to-be dog\n\n01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:16.820\nNow mind you you've got a you've got a reserve of poison that venom is like ready to what happens\n\n01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:21.540\nDo you just go like hey, man? Maybe maybe like just maybe just go to a different table or do you go?\n\n01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.620\nI just I wait well first I would go like oh\n\n01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:33.940\nI better watch what erin does in the situation because this might be how I find out she doesn't love me\n\n01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:40.580\nAnd then your poison stays put and you're just yeah, I mean why will far be it for me to poison this guy if he's he's he's\n\n01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:43.140\nYou know gonna be her new\n\n01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:45.780\nNew yeah, this is how they meet\n\n01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:50.420\nI think that's what separates us from the snakes because snakes can't just like uber to carls jr. And like\n\n01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:56.180\nYou know got like a six dollar guacamole bacon burger go home\n\n01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.300\nWell this venom would you be a bar rescue?\n\n01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.020\nWould you be immune to your own venom?\n\n01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:09.300\nOh, you have to be okay. So like you could go up to someone who's like eating a sandwich and just spit poison on it and feel like\n\n01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.860\nHey, man, that's gonna kill you. Can I have that?\n\n01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:18.100\nIt's just all the free food you could just ruin people's days\n\n01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:26.100\nIt's all about you stealing people's free sandwiches. Oh, I poisoned your slurpee, bro\n\n01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:32.340\nHey, you can't drink that can I have it? Yeah, but you you know technically you can do that with your regular spit\n\n01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:36.260\nOr regular non-excreted poison\n\n01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.780\nYeah, hey, that's not gross to me man. Can I have that?\n\n01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:44.740\nWell, I feel like if you're a venomous creature you might get more of a pass\n\n01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:50.900\nYou know, yeah, it's like if you spin something people would be like they'd punch you but not if you were a venomous creature\n\n01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:54.900\nBut they still would they would punch you and like leave you at the side of like on a sidewalk\n\n01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:59.780\nBut they still wouldn't drink their slurpee. So you'd have a black eye, but then you'd also have like a large slurpee\n\n01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:06.500\nWith your name on it. Well, we just cut out the very complicated middleman of a very complex problem\n\n01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:13.700\nSo I'm glad did you see a hard target Jean-Claude Van Damme punches a snake in it\n\n01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.700\nHow does that go he grabs a snake?\n\n01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:23.860\nIt's gonna bite the woman and then he grabs it and then he holds it and he and the camera's over the snake's shoulder\n\n01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:27.460\nAs Jean-Claude Van Damme goes\n\n01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:30.660\nAnd the snake passes out\n\n01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:33.940\nHe knocks it out\n\n01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:38.980\nLike I gotta see it. I'm obsessed with the scene. Have you seen the beach with Leonardo DiCaprio?\n\n01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.460\nNo, he punches a shark in the face\n\n01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:46.660\nAnd that and it's like the greatest thing I've ever seen because then there's a scene where he's telling\n\n01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:51.940\nThat story to a bunch of people on a beach as if as if they're like us watching the movie\n\n01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:57.220\nAnd he's like and then I decided that I will not die tonight and everyone's like, yeah, I guess you punched a shark\n\n01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:00.180\nLike they're like sort of impressed\n\n01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:06.420\nIs that the scene because I remember seeing the trailer where I just see Leo DiCaprio going like this in the trailer\n\n01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:13.380\nLike is that him's just demonstrating like hallucinating that his life is like a video game. It's not the best movie\n\n01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:17.060\nI gotta see this thing. Yeah, you should probably see it\n\n01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:23.140\nIsn't uh, what's his name from last action hero in that isn't there like an old crazy old man that's keeping him prisoner on the island or\n\n01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:28.260\nAm I thinking of you might be thinking of last action hero or dr. Moreau or\n\n01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:32.420\nShutter island shutter. Well, not shutter island. I saw I saw that\n\n01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:35.540\nShutter island little steaming little surprise\n\n01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.820\nin the theater\n\n01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:43.140\nThey love that little revealing shutter. Has everyone seen shutter island?\n\n01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:49.460\nYeah, I don't I mean, it's like it's it's the world's worst crying game\n\n01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.460\nYeah\n\n01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:54.020\nI mean you would be you would\n\n01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:58.980\nYeah, are there are there movies that have a twist that big that make you go like\n\n01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:03.700\nI'm not like that you get really excited about because sometimes I just feel like I don't like the people are fucking with me\n\n01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:09.060\nBut maybe I'm just too fragile. I don't think that's I mean our brains and our bodies are six million years old\n\n01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:13.300\nThere's no there's no such thing as like a there's twists and storytelling\n\n01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:19.060\nBut you can't just say at the end of a campfire story, but by the way this whole time they were in a hat\n\n01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.620\nThey were all really tiny and you're like\n\n01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:30.820\nYeah, I like you just took you the whole time I was telling you that bruce willis was hanging out with this kid\n\n01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.380\nGuess why you is a ghost?\n\n01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:37.140\nI didn't say anyone else could see him. What?\n\n01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:42.580\nCheck out a bunch of flashbacks motherfucker. What do you flashbacks? It's a campfire\n\n01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:48.420\nYeah, I think you gotta I mean so I mean make your movie however you want but\n\n01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.620\nShoo, I will\n\n01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:56.100\nI'm gonna make my movie and there's gonna be so many twists gotta tell this old timer a story\n\n01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.300\nFor instance horns\n\n01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:01.620\nDid you watch horns? I just watched horns\n\n01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:06.820\nI drove past the theater that was playing horns 10 times and I feel like if I did it one more time\n\n01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:11.300\nI would have gone in because that poster of old cutie little Daniel Radcliffe with horns\n\n01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:16.100\nThat's almost enough man. I don't even know what it's about. Why does he have horns? That's what it's about\n\n01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:22.100\nDid he has horns? Yeah, and why and why yeah, did you see it? No\n\n01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.940\nI watched it\n\n01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:31.540\nWhat do you think? It's like, you know old crudité\n\n01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.340\nbecause it's kind of\n\n01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:35.860\ndry and\n\n01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.860\nashy\n\n01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.860\nI\n\n01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:43.860\nSupposed to be good for me, but it's just like from Albertsons\n\n01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:47.780\nLike\n\n01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:52.740\nWhy are you trying to make me rethink how I think about morality when you don't even\n\n01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.780\nKnow what your movie's about\n\n01:18:55.780 --> 01:19:03.780\nLike why why are we going straight to me having my definitions of good and bad subverted if\n\n01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:08.580\nLike, you know, you know, I hate when crudité makes me think that\n\n01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.260\nI don't know. I'm too old\n\n01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:16.180\nI just I just watch these things now and I just I feel like just everyone's on my lawn\n\n01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.260\nI just go like get off my lawn off my lawn\n\n01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:21.540\nThere's another movie to get off my lawn like I kind of like don't even consider\n\n01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:27.140\nThe their their goal to entertain me anymore. I got I just like go six dollars six dollars\n\n01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:32.100\nOkay, what do we got here? What is this? He's fast. He's furious make up your mind\n\n01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:47.860\nLike it's not for me and I kind of like therefore I'm kind of like it's like I actually don't I can't tell you in the old days\n\n01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:51.860\nLike eight years ago. I would have been like horns. I'll tell you what I thought about horns\n\n01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:59.060\nI'd be like angry about it because underneath that anger would be some supposition that it's possible to make a good movie or that\n\n01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:02.580\nOr that or that, you know, like Robo cop was so great\n\n01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:06.820\nOr you know, it's just like I'm just 41 and my back hurts and I'm kind of like I think all these movies suck\n\n01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:12.180\nI think they've always sucked. I think everything has always sucked way more than we think like\n\n01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:15.460\nAnd you're just catching some sucky shit when you're in a good mood\n\n01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:18.500\nYou're you're like, I'm 11. Star Wars is amazing\n\n01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:21.860\nI mean, honestly, like you're not wrong, but also\n\n01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:28.020\nHave you seen birdman? I haven't seen birdman. Yeah, I want to see that six people think it's dope\n\n01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:33.940\nI saw the trailer for it and I was like, I don't think I'm gonna be able to handle watching that because it's just\n\n01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:38.900\nBecause Michael Keaton's too much for the average current movie going audience because he's too fucking good\n\n01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.300\nIt's too cool. He's back\n\n01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:45.060\nIf anyone if anyone in here doesn't think he's back\n\n01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:52.900\nWho honestly by I don't I'm sorry to do this by a show of applause if anyone doesn't think he's back\n\n01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:55.540\nSpeak now\n\n01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:03.700\nA weak applause that I will not dignify with a response. He's back. He's back. All right, Michael Keaton's back. He's back\n\n01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:10.100\nI mean, it's just a real fucking treat to watch that guy for two hours after like a million years of not singing for two hours\n\n01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.740\nYou get you get him for two hours\n\n01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:17.540\nI guess I have I guess I wasn't I didn't realize how that I hadn't seen Michael Keaton for a while\n\n01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:21.860\nYou you forget but then you see it in a movie theater and you realize like I've been watching a bunch of guys named\n\n01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:24.340\nWhite guys named chris for like the last 10 years\n\n01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:26.900\nWho the fuck are these guys?\n\n01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:31.860\nA bunch of chris is with like cool hair or not. Paul rogan rick rick philbs\n\n01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.420\nYeah, yeah, yeah, like fripply cooper dude\n\n01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:40.740\nLauren burg north like oh my god. Lauren burg was really good flintoff effron zack bergen bergen bergen\n\n01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:45.540\nA bunch of guys who have like cooler abs and they have faces and they like can't act their way out of a paper bag\n\n01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:49.860\nAnd they're driving a cool car and you're like, I guess this is a cool movie. Fucking Keaton is here for you\n\n01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:52.580\nhere for you\n\n01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.740\nAnd I'm not fucking around. It's like\n\n01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:57.860\nPeople think I'm joking\n\n01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:02.420\nListen, listen, listen, listen, and I will I promise I'll shut up. It's your show. But guys\n\n01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:06.180\nBeedlejuice does not appear in his own movie\n\n01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.980\nfor 50 minutes\n\n01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:16.420\n50 minutes into Beedlejuice. He shows up for real earlier in the movie. He's like on a commercial on a tiny tv. He's like\n\n01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:21.380\n50 minutes he comes in for real and takes the movie over\n\n01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:25.380\nNobody remembers that because he fucking owns it because he's Keaton\n\n01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.580\nHe's Keaton\n\n01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:30.580\nHey, I'll tell you something else\n\n01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:34.900\nGina Davis was an an an almost olympic archer\n\n01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.860\nDid you know that? Oh, I know google it\n\n01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:42.740\nDavis almost was in the olympics as an archer. She was almost olympic as an archer\n\n01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:45.780\nShe was in Beedlejuice and she had a sitcom where she played the president\n\n01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.780\nAnd I have no opinion about any of that stuff\n\n01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.620\nNo, yeah, I don't think she's a good or bad person. I just think it's amazing\n\n01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:56.340\nIt was post post Gina Davis the actor\n\n01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:01.460\nYep, Gina Davis might have been representing the United States as an archer at the olympics\n\n01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:04.900\nThat's impressive to me because like to be good at more than one thing\n\n01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.460\nIt really alludes me because I might be good at one thing\n\n01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:13.460\nObviously, she's got to be a pretty shitty archer because how many people can possibly be trying out for that?\n\n01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:17.540\nSince the invention of the gun\n\n01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:25.300\nHey, how many raise your hand if you can kill someone with a bow and arrow? See?\n\n01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.940\nYou could maim them like maybe draw a bunch of blood\n\n01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.540\nYou maim someone or you practiced archery?\n\n01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:43.300\nI shot an arrow at a ren fair two years ago and I did not I did not come close to a target or I\n\n01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.860\nI shot at a bale of hay and I missed\n\n01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.140\nSo\n\n01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:52.500\nAll right, we don't have an ending for the show because it's not because Spencer is a bad person\n\n01:23:55.860 --> 01:24:02.820\nIt's because we've grown over dependent on Dungeons and Dragons as a closer and yet the show has no structure anymore. There's no\n\n01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:11.060\nThe like like jeff's been on sabbatical for so long and uh, you know to ask you to keep writing these d&d\n\n01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:16.820\nUh adventurettes. I mean I wrote them, but yeah, I mean it's tough\n\n01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:21.380\nIt's a tough ass, but the show is got a it's got a Dungeons and Dragons addiction\n\n01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:28.100\nI mean we we don't know how else to to to end the show. I feel like I know how ladies and gentlemen michael keith\n\n01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:36.820\nKeep the applause. He's come check check. He's slower. It didn't work\n\n01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:40.580\nBut but honestly what if\n\n01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:45.460\nWhat if it could happen man? It would blow minds and I know that\n\n01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.740\nAnd that's amazing. That's only something keaton's back\n\n01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:56.020\nKeaton's back man. I'm sorry dan. No, it's all right. Okay. Well, so I mean you were talking a bunch of\n\n01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:01.460\nWhere are you going with all that? No, I'm just some interesting talk. I'm just floundering. I'm just sharing my anxiety\n\n01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:06.820\nI don't I don't script this show. I don't know if I if I prepared things. Do you think I'd talk about my dog?\n\n01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:12.580\nYeah, I think your dog is I'm not Bill Cosby. I haven't go. Oh my dog will be interesting\n\n01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:15.140\nI'll do a tight 20 about that and fuck Bill Cosby\n\n01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:19.380\nI don't know\n\n01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:24.420\nEverybody look people are gonna start being okay when talking about fuck Bill Cosby\n\n01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:29.060\nYeah, I mean more than one person's weak applause\n\n01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:35.460\nYeah, people were way happier about Beetlejuice not showing up for 50 minutes and they were about talking about Bill Cosby\n\n01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:40.820\nNobody here knows him. He did it. Yeah, no, I mean, that's it\n\n01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:44.100\nYou're all wrong. You're all wrong\n\n01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:49.540\nHe's not actually your dad. He just played a dad on tv. It's okay. It's okay\n\n01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:56.660\nHey, Danny did it. I know I know I know I remember we all know\n\n01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:02.580\nLet me let me let me just do it.
