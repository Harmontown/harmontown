WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
Well, I know that love lies

00:03.600 --> 00:06.900
Well, like surprise, when you do the strange, keep changing

00:07.400 --> 00:10.600
Hey, lover, hold my hand for a long time

00:10.900 --> 00:13.900
And we won't know that now I'm in love with you, baby

00:14.700 --> 00:17.600
You said you'd like to live in the romance

00:17.600 --> 00:19.400
Thank you, thank you, thank you

00:22.800 --> 00:27.100
And welcome to the Nerd Melt Showroom

00:27.100 --> 00:31.900
Like it says over and over, and don't be sad that it's all over

00:31.900 --> 00:33.900
My name is Curtis Armstrong

00:33.900 --> 00:36.300
Love better, love just lover

00:36.800 --> 00:42.600
And I am just for one night your temporary cop-troller

00:42.600 --> 00:48.400
And I wanna, I'm a goner, love just lover

00:48.400 --> 00:54.900
And please give a big Harmontown welcome to our mayor

00:54.900 --> 00:59.200
He's honoring himself, Dan Harmon

00:59.200 --> 01:06.200
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

01:06.200 --> 01:09.200
Guest cop-troller Curtis Armstrong

01:16.200 --> 01:19.200
He wasn't mad at me, I remember when I was

01:19.200 --> 01:24.700
We really have to talk about that because I actually heard about that from like other sources

01:24.700 --> 01:28.700
Somebody stopped me on the street

01:28.700 --> 01:30.700
In London?

01:30.700 --> 01:33.700
No, here, he was here, after I came back here

01:33.700 --> 01:43.700
Leah, who's not here, but usually is here, said you have to talk to Dan because he's upset and he thinks that you don't like him anymore

01:43.700 --> 01:45.700
This is my worst nightmare

01:45.700 --> 01:52.700
But I thought I'd been really clear, I just was gonna be gone for a few weeks, I really like you

01:52.700 --> 02:03.700
All right, all right, now that you had to tell me that, are you sure you now don't like me?

02:03.700 --> 02:07.700
No, no, no, now I'm more sure than ever because I've actually been thinking about it

02:07.700 --> 02:08.700
Oh, okay

02:08.700 --> 02:13.700
And because what happened was, she stopped me, it made me think, do I really like him?

02:13.700 --> 02:16.700
It was a good opportunity to check in

02:16.700 --> 02:23.700
So for a few days I had that to mull over, and then I'm coming in and I can assure you I do

02:23.700 --> 02:27.700
Oh, that's fantastic, this is actually, okay, that was my worst nightmare because I didn't want to be high maintenance

02:27.700 --> 02:32.700
But now, this is my biggest dream, which is perfectly conditional love

02:32.700 --> 02:34.700
Pretty much, yes

02:34.700 --> 02:41.700
As a child, if you receive anything less than unconditional love, and really let's face it, who got unconditional love in their home?

02:41.700 --> 02:47.700
Probably Dave Kline, who's here again tonight, I think maybe he got unconditional love, because he seemed to...

02:51.700 --> 02:57.700
That was a very demure yooop, it was filled with maternal love

02:57.700 --> 03:06.700
But yeah, no, not the case in my home, I mean, you definitely knew if you had behaved in a way that made you deserving of love

03:06.700 --> 03:14.700
Or as I like to call it, not getting hit, and so, you know, I think that drives me very much creatively

03:14.700 --> 03:20.700
It probably also complicates a lot of my relationships, so it actually sent a tingle up my spine

03:20.700 --> 03:25.700
When you said that combination, you said, it made me think, do I really like him?

03:25.700 --> 03:30.700
And I was like, yes, this is the dark circle that I have to dance on the rim of

03:30.700 --> 03:35.700
And then jackpot, I earned it, I earned it

03:35.700 --> 03:41.700
Normal people are just like, well, of course he likes me, I'm a perfectly fine person, and if he doesn't, why would I care?

03:41.700 --> 03:43.700
Not me

03:43.700 --> 03:45.700
Not me

03:45.700 --> 03:48.700
Well, how was your trip? How was your daughter?

03:48.700 --> 04:00.700
My daughter is wonderful, and she's actually working the big festival that's going on as we speak called Field Day with lots of bands

04:00.700 --> 04:03.700
And she's doing that, she's done with school, she loves school

04:03.700 --> 04:08.700
And I spent 10 days with her, without break, it was wonderful

04:08.700 --> 04:09.700
Yeah

04:09.700 --> 04:12.700
I mean, you know, I thought about you from time to time

04:12.700 --> 04:18.700
But it was great, thank you for asking

04:18.700 --> 04:21.700
Alright, awesome, can you guys see okay? You're here, alright, okay

04:21.700 --> 04:23.700
There's Seth, the hitchhiker

04:23.700 --> 04:24.700
Hi

04:24.700 --> 04:28.700
So it's a little less hitchhiking what you're doing at this point, you're just sort of orbiting the show

04:28.700 --> 04:30.700
Hey, I'm leaving tomorrow

04:30.700 --> 04:32.700
Okay, alright, well we're not yelling at you

04:33.700 --> 04:38.700
Usually hitchhikers travel in a line, whereas you've been kind of circling

04:38.700 --> 04:44.700
But that's, hey look, that's better than what I'm doing, which is, I'm just, I'm just jerking off

04:46.700 --> 04:48.700
Not right now

04:48.700 --> 04:51.700
That would be amazing if you could do it with no hands

04:53.700 --> 04:58.700
Alright, so, oh okay, so I just want to, let's talk about our art, this is our art segment

04:58.700 --> 05:09.700
So we've got music for the art segment

05:09.700 --> 05:19.700
Sometimes things are to exist at art TV or games

05:19.700 --> 05:25.700
So I was, I mean, so I have this ongoing, like, I don't know, what do you call it, like a feud

05:25.700 --> 05:28.700
Or it's a bee in Aaron's bonnet

05:28.700 --> 05:32.700
My lovely wife, Erin McGathy, who's also not here with us, she's spending time with the dogs

05:32.700 --> 05:35.700
Because we were away from them all weekend

05:35.700 --> 05:38.700
And Jeff is just sick

05:38.700 --> 05:44.700
But so, Erin, like, I don't know, she's an artist, she's more, she's a visual person

05:44.700 --> 05:55.700
She sees colors and things, and I always, I always just like, I think colors are dumb, you know, like, I don't, they seem pretty pointless

05:55.700 --> 05:58.700
I think the point of them originally was that, you know, we're primates

05:58.700 --> 06:01.700
And so we needed to recognize if an apple was going to kill us if we ate it

06:01.700 --> 06:06.700
But now we have, we have genetic engineering and, you know, all apples are fine

06:06.700 --> 06:10.700
They're injected with preservatives

06:10.700 --> 06:14.700
Yeah, it's like, we've finished it, we've taken God's place

06:14.700 --> 06:20.700
And so why not just lower the bit value of the graphics in the universe

06:20.700 --> 06:24.700
We could probably expand our RAM or our CPU

06:24.700 --> 06:29.700
If things were just black and white, imagine how much more Earth there could be, possibly

06:29.700 --> 06:34.700
I know that's not how the universe works, but I'm just saying, like, maybe our brains could process more

06:34.700 --> 06:38.700
If we just didn't see color, we're like, how about eight colors?

06:38.700 --> 06:43.700
Because that's the only ones we can name, really, and then people say, oh, egg shell instead of white

06:43.700 --> 06:46.700
And it's like, that's white, that's dumb, to me it's dumb

06:46.700 --> 06:52.700
But so Erin was always like, she showed me this magazine and she had this kind of smirk on her face

06:52.700 --> 06:56.700
And she shows me this, like, grid thing

06:56.700 --> 07:02.700
It's like, it's this thing with like a thousand lines in it, and she's like, how many colors do you see here?

07:02.700 --> 07:06.700
And I'm like, I don't know, like, the usual eight dumb colors

07:06.700 --> 07:12.700
And she's like, you know, I'm a tetra-hakamagaba

07:12.700 --> 07:17.700
Like, there's some, she's got more cones or rods or something in her eyes

07:17.700 --> 07:21.700
She's a tetra-chromat, tetra-chromats?

07:21.700 --> 07:27.700
Where are my tetra-chromes at?

07:27.700 --> 07:35.700
She's immensely proud of this, which I would equate to being proud of your race, which is bad

07:35.700 --> 07:46.700
It seems like a vile quality in a person, like, what is the difference between that and saying, like, you know I have very little melanin in my skin

07:46.700 --> 07:50.700
I'm like a snowbank

07:50.700 --> 08:00.700
Oh, so you're, okay, great, you're racist, so, but she's like smirking because she can see, like, I don't know, more of them than I can

08:00.700 --> 08:07.700
She's enough that you could, but I'm like, wait, how many can you see? She's like 20 or 30 or something, whatever the number is, 38

08:07.700 --> 08:12.700
And as I'm like, well, are you talking about all the different shades of the colors?

08:12.700 --> 08:15.700
And she's like, yeah, well, how many shades do you see?

08:15.700 --> 08:21.700
And I'm like, are we really talking about each individual shade, each striation that you can see on this thing?

08:21.700 --> 08:28.700
And she's like, yeah, and I'm like, well, I mean, that's ridiculous, but one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

08:28.700 --> 08:31.700
And she's like, shut up, stop it, you're lying

08:31.700 --> 08:38.700
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33? 33, I guess, I mean, there's probably a couple more, but I'll lowball it

08:38.700 --> 08:41.700
And she's like, fuck you, you're lying

08:41.700 --> 08:45.700
And I'm like, no, I'm not, colors are dumb

08:45.700 --> 08:52.700
I got more cones too, I'm a tetracycline

08:52.700 --> 08:57.700
But I just throw them away, they just go into my eye and I just go

08:57.700 --> 09:02.700
Because they're dumb, you don't need them

09:02.700 --> 09:08.700
Who needs more colors? You know who had more colors in grade school? The rich kids

09:08.700 --> 09:12.700
Going by Crayola metrics, those were rich kids

09:12.700 --> 09:16.700
They also had a sharpener built into the front of the box

09:16.700 --> 09:20.700
Little, little, little, little, little born rich parasites

09:20.700 --> 09:22.700
Because dads didn't hit them

09:22.700 --> 09:28.700
I had to earn every fucking crayon in my shitty little stepped on box

09:28.700 --> 09:33.700
Broken chunks of like, just like caveman pigment

09:33.700 --> 09:38.700
I had to go out and dig up clay and ochre

09:38.700 --> 09:44.700
And like, make red, because my parents are like, there's red out there, go get it in the yard

09:44.700 --> 09:50.700
There's red on your pillowcase, yeah, because you guys don't give me enough water

09:50.700 --> 09:55.700
I got a lot of nosebleeds when I was a kid

09:55.700 --> 09:58.700
I thought I was an alien abductee, do you believe in alien abduction?

09:58.700 --> 10:02.700
I do, I do, I do, yeah, I think that's a real possibility

10:02.700 --> 10:04.700
Huh, yeah

10:06.700 --> 10:08.700
I'm assuming you don't

10:08.700 --> 10:12.700
I did when I was a kid, I was like, I think that's a thing that you gravitate to when you're a kid

10:12.700 --> 10:14.700
Because it's a real...

10:14.700 --> 10:16.700
It explains a lot

10:16.700 --> 10:20.700
Well, yeah, it helps you cope, I think, you know, the fantasy that you're special

10:20.700 --> 10:23.700
The world is hard for you for a reason

10:23.700 --> 10:29.700
Maybe these people are coming and getting you and then they're like, you know, milking your prostate

10:29.700 --> 10:33.700
Telling you secrets about the environment

10:33.700 --> 10:35.700
You're destroying it

10:35.700 --> 10:43.700
We know things that you can only find out from cow anuses and like, go back to your world

10:43.700 --> 10:47.700
But we're gonna keep coming back and giving you nosebleeds and you're so special

10:47.700 --> 10:52.700
I'm still waiting for you to explain why none of this makes sense

10:52.700 --> 10:54.700
It still does, I'm not like that

10:54.700 --> 10:57.700
When you grow up, why do you not believe in that anymore?

10:57.700 --> 11:02.700
I think I started to, well, I started to learn about things like sleep paralysis

11:02.700 --> 11:06.700
Which there's this, I don't know if it's a good documentary, Aaron and I just watched it tonight

11:06.700 --> 11:13.700
The guys that made the documentary about the shining, Room 237, is that, am I getting that right?

11:13.700 --> 11:17.700
That's a really interesting documentary that everybody should watch

11:17.700 --> 11:22.700
This one's also very interesting, I hesitate to use the words good documentary because I don't know if it's...

11:22.700 --> 11:27.700
Because it's just a bunch of people talking about their sleep paralysis experiences

11:27.700 --> 11:31.700
It's very interesting, but maybe that's different from a good documentary

11:31.700 --> 11:34.700
Shut up, Dan, just shut up

11:34.700 --> 11:37.700
Alright, now start talking

11:37.700 --> 11:39.700
First check to see if everyone likes you

11:46.700 --> 11:48.700
Sarcasm

11:48.700 --> 11:52.700
I can tell when it's fake, I can always tell when it's fake

11:52.700 --> 11:56.700
So, the, god damn it, sleep paralysis, you know what I'm talking about

11:56.700 --> 11:58.700
So you go to, have you ever had that?

11:58.700 --> 11:59.700
No, I've had it

11:59.700 --> 12:01.700
Oh, it's terrifying, I've had it

12:01.700 --> 12:04.700
How many people have had sleep paralysis experiences?

12:04.700 --> 12:05.700
Really?

12:05.700 --> 12:07.700
It's a very common thing

12:07.700 --> 12:13.700
The odd thing is, it's very common for it to happen very rarely to everybody

12:13.700 --> 12:18.700
It's very uncommon for it to happen all the time to a few people

12:18.700 --> 12:21.700
Which is, some people have it every night

12:21.700 --> 12:25.700
And they're living in like a sort of strange hellscape

12:25.700 --> 12:29.700
Where they have no choice but to like make friends with the shadow people

12:29.700 --> 12:32.700
And give them names and stuff, I go, that's the one with the hat

12:32.700 --> 12:35.700
By the way, hats aren't scary by the way

12:35.700 --> 12:39.700
They show like the shadow, because one of the symptoms of sleep paralysis

12:39.700 --> 12:41.700
One of the things that happens is the intruder

12:41.700 --> 12:44.700
This happened to me, this is a terrifying thing

12:44.700 --> 12:46.700
Sometimes a lot of people talk about things on their chest

12:46.700 --> 12:49.700
Just in case anybody doesn't know what this is

12:49.700 --> 12:53.700
I mean, the scientific theory is that when you go into REM sleep

12:53.700 --> 12:56.700
Which is when you're going to start dreaming

12:56.700 --> 13:04.700
The scientific explanation for this is that your body releases a, or your brain releases a chemical to your body

13:04.700 --> 13:10.700
Or something that keeps it from moving whenever you'd want to move it

13:10.700 --> 13:13.700
Like when you're reaching for a big cookie in your dream

13:13.700 --> 13:16.700
So you don't gouge your wife's eyes out

13:16.700 --> 13:20.700
So it's a natural part of REM sleep

13:20.700 --> 13:25.700
Supposedly to just, your body is supposed to not move and cannot move chemically

13:25.700 --> 13:30.700
However, you're always supposed to be unconscious and sleeping when that's happening

13:30.700 --> 13:34.700
And sleep paralysis is when either while waking up or going to sleep

13:34.700 --> 13:40.700
When you get to the same, there's an overlap where you are awake and your body is completely paralyzed

13:40.700 --> 13:43.700
And so then your middle brain starts to panic

13:43.700 --> 13:46.700
And then these things, these very common things that happen

13:46.700 --> 13:53.700
Like people see things on their chest that are like, you know, demonic kind of iconography that happens

13:53.700 --> 13:58.700
And like one of the most common things is just this shadowy figure in the room walking toward you

13:58.700 --> 14:03.700
And it happened, and there's like these archetypes like the shadow, the little shadow man

14:03.700 --> 14:06.700
And the guy with the hat, which is, again, not scary

14:06.700 --> 14:12.700
It's like a hat, it looks like a pizza logo, it looks like Rocky Rococo

14:12.700 --> 14:18.700
And then there's an evil hag, which I feel like, because I saw like a cloaked figure

14:18.700 --> 14:22.700
I was like 20 years old, I was sleeping at my parents house

14:22.700 --> 14:27.700
Probably laundry or something, doing laundry for the weekend and I was crashing in my old bedroom

14:27.700 --> 14:34.700
And this happened to me and I woke up and I couldn't move and this, I mean, it's so real

14:34.700 --> 14:43.700
There was a cloaked black figure in the corner of my bedroom that just strode confidently toward me

14:43.700 --> 14:48.700
I could hear every footfall on the carpet, it was like, it was really, really there

14:48.700 --> 14:55.700
It wasn't a visual hallucination, it was like, I was sensing all of it, the proximity, the sound of its footsteps

14:55.700 --> 15:00.700
And this like image of, I think, a female figure, kind of cloaked and permanently in shadow

15:00.700 --> 15:07.700
Just marching across the room toward me, which is just, you know, sometimes you see a coat rack in the dark

15:07.700 --> 15:13.700
And you're like, holy shit, oh god, that scared me for a second, but this is a person in the room that is like there

15:13.700 --> 15:16.700
It's not like, oh, that looks like something, it's there

15:16.700 --> 15:21.700
And it's just like, marched across the room and just kept coming at me

15:21.700 --> 15:26.700
As soon as it, as if it just wanted to do just that, just wanted to put its face in my face

15:26.700 --> 15:31.700
And which is like, that's even scarier, because you're like, why would you want to just scare a person?

15:31.700 --> 15:39.700
Because you're crazy, so you, so it's like, and then as soon as the face got close enough to touch my neck

15:39.700 --> 15:44.700
I finally was able to, because the whole time you're trying to scream and you can't

15:44.700 --> 15:46.700
And then I finally went, mom!

15:46.700 --> 15:48.700
And I was 20

15:48.700 --> 15:53.700
And I like bolted up and then I just sat there and I was like, catching my breath in the adrenaline

15:53.700 --> 15:57.700
As I'm realizing this was all, this was not real, but I just shouted out, mom

15:57.700 --> 16:01.700
And then I just kept waiting, and I was, I thought about saying, I'm okay

16:01.700 --> 16:04.700
But then I was like, let's see what happens

16:04.700 --> 16:06.700
Never nothing

16:06.700 --> 16:08.700
And I just went back to sleep

16:08.700 --> 16:09.700
Wow

16:09.700 --> 16:17.700
And I've had a couple of experiences that fit in the same category, but that was the legit textbook sleep paralysis

16:17.700 --> 16:18.700
It's never happened to you

16:18.700 --> 16:20.700
Never, absolutely not

16:20.700 --> 16:22.700
And did it ever happen after that to you?

16:22.700 --> 16:25.700
Yeah, I've had like a couple weird like related kind of things

16:25.700 --> 16:26.700
But not like that

16:26.700 --> 16:28.700
Nothing that was really terrifying

16:28.700 --> 16:33.700
No, like I've had just generic, I wake up and I can't move my body and I panic

16:33.700 --> 16:36.700
And then I'm suddenly able to move it

16:36.700 --> 16:40.700
But like not with the goo guys coming at me

16:40.700 --> 16:50.700
And I've also had like weird like, I would have these things in my mid-20s where like

16:50.700 --> 16:56.700
It's like my, it's like all of a sudden I'm sleeping and then I'm awake, but I can't move

16:56.700 --> 17:02.700
And then my whole self, but my body's still in the bed

17:02.700 --> 17:07.700
My whole self starts getting thrown around the room, banged up against the walls

17:07.700 --> 17:15.700
Like somebody's trying to pull my soul out of my apartment

17:15.700 --> 17:20.700
But for some reason it can only move it around in the room

17:20.700 --> 17:23.700
So it's just banging into every wall and ceiling

17:23.700 --> 17:26.700
And I can kind of see that I'm still in bed

17:26.700 --> 17:32.700
And then finally at a certain point it manages to get out and I shoot up into the sky

17:32.700 --> 17:36.700
At like the speed of sound, I'm assuming

17:36.700 --> 17:40.700
And it's like, it's actually kind of cool, I'm like, holy shit I can fly

17:40.700 --> 17:44.700
This is going to be amazing, I'm going to be like this new kind of hero

17:44.700 --> 17:48.700
I can do this at night and I'm assuming I won't be able to get shot or stabbed

17:48.700 --> 17:51.700
So I could probably fight crime or at least discourage it

17:51.700 --> 17:56.700
And I'm like, there's just this elated feeling of like, holy shit I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying

17:56.700 --> 18:01.700
And then just gives way as the physics of it like start to kick in where you're like

18:01.700 --> 18:05.700
I'm not flying, I've been rocketed upward, I can't fly

18:05.700 --> 18:09.700
I'm just really high up in the sky and you feel the momentum stop

18:09.700 --> 18:11.700
And then you're like, now I'm going to fall

18:11.700 --> 18:13.700
And it's like, what?

18:13.700 --> 18:17.700
It just turns into one of those falling nightmares and then you wake up

18:17.700 --> 18:20.700
So anyways, and you just

18:20.700 --> 18:23.700
I would actually have told that one first

18:23.700 --> 18:28.700
That's a lot more dramatic than the woman walking towards you

18:28.700 --> 18:31.700
Well, noted, alright

18:31.700 --> 18:34.700
That's good, it's conditional love

18:34.700 --> 18:36.700
Keep letting me know when I fuck up

18:36.700 --> 18:38.700
They were both good stories though

18:43.700 --> 18:47.700
What are your dreams about, like a gumdrop tree? Fuck you

18:50.700 --> 18:53.700
I had unconditional love

18:53.700 --> 18:59.700
You just like a, you dream like we assume dogs do, you're just like chasing a rabbit

18:59.700 --> 19:02.700
And then while you're sleeping you're like

19:03.700 --> 19:05.700
Your wife's like, oh, he's dreaming

19:05.700 --> 19:07.700
He's so cute

19:07.700 --> 19:10.700
I am cute when I do that

19:11.700 --> 19:16.700
Do you ever see the YouTube video of the dog that's dreaming and it's doing like, it's like running on its side

19:16.700 --> 19:21.700
And it's like, and then it's like, it's running and then it starts to like

19:21.700 --> 19:24.700
It starts to run really fast and then it like looks behind it

19:24.700 --> 19:28.700
Like it's snarling, like it's clearly being chased by something it doesn't like

19:28.700 --> 19:34.700
And then it kind of, it gets up and runs full speed into a wall right next to it

19:34.700 --> 19:36.700
And then wakes up

19:37.700 --> 19:40.700
And then it just kind of like sits there like, yeah

19:42.700 --> 19:46.700
I mean, who do you talk to when you're a dog, when that happens to you

19:46.700 --> 19:48.700
You got nobody you can go to with that

19:51.700 --> 19:53.700
Alright, so colors are dumb

19:53.700 --> 20:01.700
You know, I'll save that for when Spencer's out here

20:02.700 --> 20:05.700
Alright, okay, well let's meet a new friend shall we

20:05.700 --> 20:06.700
Sure

20:06.700 --> 20:12.700
I invited somebody, you know, somebody that I've been interacting with throughout my career from time to time

20:12.700 --> 20:15.700
You know, we're not, we don't hang out ever

20:15.700 --> 20:17.700
I think we're like Commissioner Gortons to each other

20:17.700 --> 20:24.700
Neither of us is Batman, but we're just using that to illustrate distance and respect

20:29.700 --> 20:33.700
Big grudging functional vigilante respect

20:33.700 --> 20:35.700
The system has failed us both

20:37.700 --> 20:38.700
And there we are

20:39.700 --> 20:46.700
The funniest moment in the good Batman movie, the middle Christian Bale one, the Heath Ledger one

20:46.700 --> 20:53.700
I always laugh when Commissioner Gortons goes into the bank vault and it's like fluorescent lit

20:53.700 --> 20:56.700
And then he's like, oh no, the money's marked or whatever

20:57.700 --> 21:01.700
And then he turns, it's like one of the cops turns and Batman's just hanging out

21:02.700 --> 21:07.700
It looks so funny, he's like, I know he does that all the time because he's like a detective

21:07.700 --> 21:10.700
But it's just weird that he would be like, hey, I'm here

21:10.700 --> 21:16.700
Like he had to get into that room and it's like, usually Batman comes in through like little windows and things

21:16.700 --> 21:21.700
And it's usually nighttime and this is like just noon and it's like, there's like fluorescent lights

21:21.700 --> 21:28.700
And it's just funny, it's also funny to cut from someone looking and then just a hard cut to Batman

21:29.700 --> 21:33.700
He just looks like, oh he just looks like the biggest nerd in that moment

21:33.700 --> 21:36.700
There's no way enough for that to look cool

21:36.700 --> 21:42.700
It's like, because we've seen people under fluorescent light dressed as Batman

21:42.700 --> 21:44.700
And we've never gone like, ooh

21:46.700 --> 21:51.700
We've always just, at best we'll go like, hey can I get a picture, man? You look really awesome

21:55.700 --> 21:57.700
It's a single gunshot from the back

21:57.700 --> 22:09.700
No note, but a brief check of his closet at home tells us the whole story

22:11.700 --> 22:13.700
Alright, yeah, sorry, I was introducing this guy

22:15.700 --> 22:17.700
Apparently this guy needs no introduction

22:20.700 --> 22:23.700
He's really what he is, he's the editor of TV Guide Magazine

22:23.700 --> 22:28.700
But because the world is changing, one of the cruel tricks of fate is that he has a new title

22:28.700 --> 22:30.700
Which is just not as sexy

22:30.700 --> 22:35.700
He's still just as important, but he's now called the chief content officer

22:38.700 --> 22:39.700
Poor guy

22:40.700 --> 22:45.700
But he's awesome and he's a sort of, I don't know, he's my TV talking buddy

22:45.700 --> 22:54.700
It's Mike Schneider

23:00.700 --> 23:03.700
I think they like it when you sit there, yeah, that's your mic

23:06.700 --> 23:08.700
So we're talking about dreams, right?

23:10.700 --> 23:13.700
You guys have these dreams that are so vivid that you wake up the next day

23:13.700 --> 23:16.700
And you're still not quite sure if it was real or not, if it really happened or not

23:16.700 --> 23:22.700
Yeah, like when you're in your early 20s, and I always had those dreams where you'd find a $50

23:22.700 --> 23:28.700
And it's like you really need $50, that's like a lot of ramen noodles and pot and stuff

23:28.700 --> 23:36.700
And you're like, it's like such a low-stakes dream that you're like three hours into your shower

23:36.700 --> 23:38.700
Three hour shower

23:38.700 --> 23:43.700
Three hours into your day when you suddenly realize you don't have $50

23:43.700 --> 23:45.700
It's so sad

23:45.700 --> 23:46.700
The biggest letdown of the day

23:46.700 --> 23:54.700
So I had this really weird dream last night, and maybe amateur psychologists dream catcher Dan Harmon can help me with this

23:54.700 --> 23:58.700
So in my dream, I'm suddenly a contestant on Jeopardy

23:58.700 --> 24:04.700
But for some reason, they've sold like the branding rights to Dunkin' Donuts

24:04.700 --> 24:12.700
So there's a new Jeopardy set, literally right behind Trebek is a functioning Dunkin' Donuts branch

24:12.700 --> 24:14.700
Where they're actually selling donuts on the set

24:14.700 --> 24:15.700
During the game show?

24:15.700 --> 24:18.700
During the game show, they're in the background like selling donuts

24:18.700 --> 24:22.700
And Trebek is standing up there, and Trebek doesn't give a fuck anymore

24:22.700 --> 24:24.700
Trebek is like, I'm done with this

24:24.700 --> 24:28.700
So the episode is going on, and it's me and two other contestants

24:28.700 --> 24:31.700
And he's talking to us, he's asking us about ourselves

24:31.700 --> 24:34.700
But he never gets around to actually asking any questions

24:34.700 --> 24:37.700
So halfway through the show, suddenly people in the audience start screaming out

24:37.700 --> 24:39.700
Trebek, ask a question!

24:39.700 --> 24:41.700
And he just sort of glares at them and goes back

24:41.700 --> 24:44.700
And he starts asking me again about, you know, what I do for a living

24:44.700 --> 24:47.700
And it still says zero underneath me

24:47.700 --> 24:50.700
And meanwhile, they're making donuts in the background

24:50.700 --> 24:53.700
I'm actually thinking, that donut looks pretty good

24:53.700 --> 24:57.700
Alright, so corporate America has changed the media escape to a point where

24:57.700 --> 25:01.700
Although you're a nice guy and feel fulfilled and know who you are

25:01.700 --> 25:04.700
The clock is running out on your life and you're not achieving anything

25:04.700 --> 25:06.700
That's pretty good

25:10.700 --> 25:14.700
So literally today, I go and I run into my brother-in-law

25:14.700 --> 25:16.700
And the first thing he says out of his mouth is

25:16.700 --> 25:18.700
Hey, they're opening a new Dunkin' Donuts in Encino!

25:18.700 --> 25:20.700
What?!

25:20.700 --> 25:23.700
You were, I don't know what that meant, but

25:23.700 --> 25:27.700
Like the first thing, like today, it's following me

25:27.700 --> 25:28.700
That's weird

25:28.700 --> 25:29.700
It's bizarre

25:29.700 --> 25:31.700
I mean, I know Dunkin' Donuts aren't rare

25:31.700 --> 25:33.700
But that's definitely weird

25:33.700 --> 25:36.700
I haven't heard the word Dunkin' Donuts all week

25:36.700 --> 25:39.700
If I dreamt about a Dunkin' Donuts and someone mentioned it

25:39.700 --> 25:42.700
That would be, I would consider that notable

25:42.700 --> 25:44.700
Notable evidence of paranormal activity

25:44.700 --> 25:47.700
That's why the very first thing I brought up on your podcast right now

25:47.700 --> 25:50.700
Was my Dunkin' Donuts stream for some strange reason

25:50.700 --> 25:55.700
There was one story of the sleep paralysis thing where the guy was talking

25:55.700 --> 25:58.700
He told a story about how there was a demon standing over him

25:58.700 --> 26:01.700
And telling him, you're gonna die, I'm a demon

26:04.700 --> 26:06.700
But then his girlfriend sat up screaming

26:06.700 --> 26:08.700
Yeah, but she said that said demon on it

26:11.700 --> 26:14.700
Demon with two D's for a double dose of this

26:14.700 --> 26:15.700
A demon

26:15.700 --> 26:16.700
Um

26:19.700 --> 26:21.700
His girlfriend sat up screaming

26:21.700 --> 26:23.700
And she was having a night terror

26:23.700 --> 26:25.700
And in her nightmare

26:25.700 --> 26:28.700
There was a cat sitting on her chest

26:28.700 --> 26:31.700
Speaking in gibberish to her boyfriend

26:31.700 --> 26:33.700
At the same time

26:33.700 --> 26:35.700
But the cat, it was a giant black cat

26:35.700 --> 26:37.700
And a lot of people report that

26:37.700 --> 26:39.700
I think it's just an explanation for this giant

26:39.700 --> 26:44.700
Your mind is trying to put an object on something that makes no sense

26:44.700 --> 26:47.700
And a lot of people make it a big black cat

26:47.700 --> 26:49.700
Her big black cat had red eyes

26:49.700 --> 26:51.700
And so did this demon

26:51.700 --> 26:53.700
At that point in the documentary I said

26:53.700 --> 26:55.700
I don't know if I believe that

26:55.700 --> 26:57.700
And Aaron said why

26:57.700 --> 27:01.700
Because that's kind of like confirmed proof of supernatural activity

27:01.700 --> 27:08.700
I'm not like a cynical skeptic about things for no reason

27:08.700 --> 27:10.700
But then again I take it very seriously

27:10.700 --> 27:12.700
If somebody asserts like Jeff does

27:12.700 --> 27:14.700
That he predicted 9-11 when his dream

27:14.700 --> 27:15.700
You know it's like

27:15.700 --> 27:18.700
I just get really quiet and wait for Kumail to

27:18.700 --> 27:21.700
Start point making fun of him

27:21.700 --> 27:23.700
He did that and I predicted the Dunkin Donuts in Encino

27:23.700 --> 27:24.700
So it's kinda

27:24.700 --> 27:26.700
But that's right on the bubble

27:26.700 --> 27:28.700
I mean that's intriguing to me

27:28.700 --> 27:30.700
Because I feel like that's possible

27:30.700 --> 27:33.700
It's too coincidental that she's dreaming of a black cat with red eyes

27:33.700 --> 27:35.700
And there's a demon with red eyes

27:35.700 --> 27:37.700
I don't know, I feel like someone's lying

27:37.700 --> 27:41.700
But what do you make of this paranormal shenanigans?

27:41.700 --> 27:43.700
I mean I like, I just

27:43.700 --> 27:46.700
What's strange about that one is that those two events were happening

27:46.700 --> 27:48.700
Supposedly at the exact same time

27:48.700 --> 27:49.700
Which is very weird

27:49.700 --> 27:51.700
Aaron said well this guy has this thing happen to him every night

27:51.700 --> 27:54.700
In one form or another so it's only a matter of statistics

27:54.700 --> 27:57.700
Well then it would make sense that she was having nightmares like that

27:57.700 --> 27:59.700
Because if this happens to him all the time

27:59.700 --> 28:00.700
That's a good point

28:00.700 --> 28:01.700
Yeah

28:01.700 --> 28:04.700
Have you heard the stories of the people who actually can't fall asleep

28:04.700 --> 28:07.700
And after a couple of weeks of not sleeping

28:07.700 --> 28:10.700
They start to actually hallucinate the things that they're dreaming

28:10.700 --> 28:12.700
That they're actually dreaming but they're awake

28:12.700 --> 28:14.700
I've been in that state

28:14.700 --> 28:15.700
Yeah

28:15.700 --> 28:17.700
Toward the end of every season

28:18.700 --> 28:20.700
I'll go a couple days without sleep

28:20.700 --> 28:24.700
But there's a sort of delusional state that sets in

28:24.700 --> 28:26.700
Which is actually really cool

28:26.700 --> 28:30.700
And you stop needing as much sleep

28:30.700 --> 28:33.700
The same way you've heard this

28:33.700 --> 28:35.700
And may probably experience it

28:35.700 --> 28:38.700
Your body suppresses illness

28:38.700 --> 28:40.700
Like your body has this sense of like

28:40.700 --> 28:43.700
Well she needs to get her work done at the hospital

28:43.700 --> 28:45.700
Or whatever for this week

28:45.700 --> 28:46.700
This is a rough week

28:46.700 --> 28:48.700
And you feel like you're maybe gonna get sick

28:48.700 --> 28:50.700
Or you've been exposed to all these colds and stuff

28:50.700 --> 28:51.700
And you're not getting sick

28:51.700 --> 28:53.700
And you're just like I guess I just don't get sick

28:53.700 --> 28:56.700
And then the week ends and you just like collapse into mucus

28:56.700 --> 28:58.700
Like because your body's like yeah fuck you

28:58.700 --> 29:00.700
You were sick the whole time

29:00.700 --> 29:02.700
But the same thing

29:02.700 --> 29:04.700
It works that way with sleep too I think

29:04.700 --> 29:06.700
After a while after a certain amount of sleep deprivation

29:06.700 --> 29:08.700
Kids try this

29:10.700 --> 29:13.700
You can actually just like sleep for 20 minutes at a time

29:13.700 --> 29:15.700
And then just when you wake up

29:15.700 --> 29:17.700
And it's like there's no way you got enough sleep

29:17.700 --> 29:20.700
But your body is just now on the Atkins diet of sleep

29:20.700 --> 29:22.700
Where it's like just give me a little nibble of ham

29:22.700 --> 29:24.700
Just give me something

29:24.700 --> 29:25.700
I don't need this knickers bar

29:25.700 --> 29:27.700
I don't need to sleep for 8 hours

29:27.700 --> 29:28.700
But I get it you're an asshole

29:28.700 --> 29:31.700
Give me a little berry from a bush

29:31.700 --> 29:33.700
So I can keep going

29:33.700 --> 29:34.700
It's pretty cool

29:34.700 --> 29:37.700
Because I will fall asleep while typing

29:37.700 --> 29:40.700
And then you wake up and then you read

29:40.700 --> 29:42.700
Just weird shit

29:42.700 --> 29:47.700
And then I would fall asleep in writer's rooms

29:47.700 --> 29:50.700
And I'm kind of like half like I'm still asleep

29:50.700 --> 29:52.700
But my eyes are open and I'm just saying something

29:52.700 --> 29:55.700
Like I'll just start to be like

29:55.700 --> 29:58.700
Well what if Annie's jealous of Britta

29:58.700 --> 30:00.700
And so she does this and then I'll go

30:00.700 --> 30:04.700
Uh, what about Minecraft?

30:04.700 --> 30:06.700
Or something that else that's out of like

30:06.700 --> 30:07.700
From other part of my brain

30:07.700 --> 30:09.700
And everyone will get this weird look on their face

30:09.700 --> 30:10.700
And I'll get embarrassed

30:10.700 --> 30:12.700
And I'll go take a nap in my office

30:12.700 --> 30:13.700
Sounds healthy

30:13.700 --> 30:14.700
Yeah

30:14.700 --> 30:16.700
But it made the show so good

30:16.700 --> 30:18.700
Um

30:18.700 --> 30:21.700
Again

30:21.700 --> 30:23.700
I can tell when it's lies

30:23.700 --> 30:25.700
I'm not interested

30:25.700 --> 30:26.700
I'll tell, look I know

30:26.700 --> 30:27.700
That's you guys saying

30:27.700 --> 30:28.700
Hey we enjoyed season 6

30:28.700 --> 30:29.700
And thank you very much for saying that

30:29.700 --> 30:30.700
All over Twitter too

30:30.700 --> 30:31.700
Thank you

30:31.700 --> 30:32.700
Ham girl

30:32.700 --> 30:34.700
That keeps me going

30:34.700 --> 30:35.700
But

30:41.700 --> 30:43.700
Oh no please they're standing up in the back

30:43.700 --> 30:45.700
Oh no don't everybody stand up

30:45.700 --> 30:47.700
I thought that might work

30:47.700 --> 30:49.700
I thought if everyone thought a standing o

30:49.700 --> 30:50.700
Was happening behind them

30:50.700 --> 30:52.700
You could like start one from the back

30:52.700 --> 30:55.700
Uh

30:55.700 --> 30:57.700
Not like the real standing o I got

30:57.700 --> 30:58.700
When I wrote those Oscars

30:58.700 --> 31:00.700
That Hugh Jackman hosted

31:00.700 --> 31:02.700
Sean Penn just fucking leaped to his feet

31:02.700 --> 31:03.700
He was like

31:03.700 --> 31:04.700
Yes best Oscars ever

31:04.700 --> 31:05.700
That's amazing

31:05.700 --> 31:06.700
And then Ed Harris was like

31:06.700 --> 31:08.700
I agree I don't care

31:08.700 --> 31:10.700
Morgan Freeman was like

31:10.700 --> 31:12.700
Yeah

31:15.700 --> 31:17.700
Um so uh

31:17.700 --> 31:18.700
So by the way

31:18.700 --> 31:20.700
National Treasure Curtis Armstrong

31:20.700 --> 31:23.700
National Treasure Curtis Armstrong

31:23.700 --> 31:24.700
Oh oh oh I thought

31:24.700 --> 31:26.700
He wasn't in National Treasure

31:26.700 --> 31:28.700
That's Steve Zahn

31:31.700 --> 31:32.700
That was very nice of you

31:32.700 --> 31:33.700
Thank you

31:33.700 --> 31:34.700
No he's I mean

31:34.700 --> 31:35.700
It's right

31:35.700 --> 31:36.700
Yeah don't get me started

31:36.700 --> 31:37.700
It's the guy

31:37.700 --> 31:39.700
Well it's one of those guys

31:39.700 --> 31:41.700
One of those guys

31:41.700 --> 31:43.700
The K-12 dude

31:43.700 --> 31:45.700
The K-12 dude

31:45.700 --> 31:48.700
Yeah

31:48.700 --> 31:50.700
I get a lot of tweets from youngsters

31:50.700 --> 31:52.700
Now that are watching better off dead

31:52.700 --> 31:53.700
Because they

31:53.700 --> 31:54.700
Because you became a friend of the show

31:54.700 --> 31:56.700
They'd never seen it

31:56.700 --> 31:57.700
Which I'm exceptionally proud of

31:57.700 --> 31:59.700
Because that movie does hold up and is awesome

31:59.700 --> 32:01.700
And it's like nice to see somebody go

32:01.700 --> 32:02.700
Holy shit I just rented this

32:02.700 --> 32:03.700
I never would have

32:03.700 --> 32:04.700
And it's so amazing

32:04.700 --> 32:07.700
I know I really like seeing those

32:07.700 --> 32:08.700
That's really nice

32:08.700 --> 32:09.700
Yeah

32:09.700 --> 32:11.700
Shit okay so

32:11.700 --> 32:12.700
What the fuck was that

32:12.700 --> 32:13.700
We were gonna talk about TV

32:13.700 --> 32:14.700
Probably I assume

32:14.700 --> 32:16.700
But what with the

32:16.700 --> 32:17.700
Yeah don't

32:17.700 --> 32:18.700
Yes everybody gets lots of sleep

32:18.700 --> 32:20.700
Um

32:20.700 --> 32:21.700
Alright

32:21.700 --> 32:22.700
Well yeah let's talk about TV

32:22.700 --> 32:25.700
So it's the Golden Age of Television

32:25.700 --> 32:29.700
Which is true because TV is higher quality

32:29.700 --> 32:30.700
Than the movies

32:30.700 --> 32:32.700
Because movies are big international business

32:32.700 --> 32:35.700
So we're just churning out these like giant movies

32:35.700 --> 32:38.700
And the weird cultural shift is now that

32:38.700 --> 32:40.700
Yeah you look at Disney and Warner Brothers

32:40.700 --> 32:41.700
And the majority of

32:41.700 --> 32:43.700
It's the big DC or Marvel franchises

32:43.700 --> 32:45.700
Or what they're kind of focusing on

32:45.700 --> 32:46.700
Or also some Pixar in the future

32:46.700 --> 32:48.700
But really that's what the movies now are

32:48.700 --> 32:49.700
So all the other stuff

32:49.700 --> 32:51.700
Yeah and you're averaging out

32:51.700 --> 32:52.700
Instead of making like

32:52.700 --> 32:54.700
Something that's about an insight into

32:54.700 --> 32:56.700
For instance like American

32:56.700 --> 32:57.700
Domestic culture

32:57.700 --> 32:59.700
And then exporting it

32:59.700 --> 33:01.700
To other countries as television

33:01.700 --> 33:03.700
Where there could still be that cultural like

33:03.700 --> 33:04.700
Oh this is an American show

33:04.700 --> 33:06.700
I know that going in

33:06.700 --> 33:08.700
Like the movies are like

33:08.700 --> 33:10.700
The American audience is like a fraction

33:10.700 --> 33:12.700
Of the box office that they even care about

33:12.700 --> 33:15.700
Didn't they release the New Avengers movie

33:15.700 --> 33:17.700
In China before here

33:17.700 --> 33:20.700
Or it was like America was like the last

33:20.700 --> 33:22.700
Yeah and you know what's interesting too

33:22.700 --> 33:24.700
Is now they're having to sort of

33:24.700 --> 33:26.700
There are certain things they won't do

33:26.700 --> 33:27.700
In some of these big movies now

33:27.700 --> 33:29.700
Because China is such a large percentage

33:29.700 --> 33:31.700
Of the box office

33:31.700 --> 33:33.700
And that's just the tip of the iceberg

33:33.700 --> 33:34.700
In terms of like the effect of

33:34.700 --> 33:37.700
If you're making a movie for an entire planet

33:37.700 --> 33:40.700
And you need it to be this big crazy movie

33:40.700 --> 33:42.700
And obviously a byproduct of that

33:42.700 --> 33:44.700
I mean one effect of that is that

33:44.700 --> 33:45.700
CG is going to get really good

33:45.700 --> 33:47.700
And it really has and it's amazing

33:47.700 --> 33:48.700
We can do anything now

33:48.700 --> 33:49.700
And to the point where I was watching Mad Max

33:49.700 --> 33:51.700
I had no idea

33:51.700 --> 33:53.700
Everyone that keeps walking out of Mad Max

33:53.700 --> 33:54.700
Is always saying the same thing

33:54.700 --> 33:55.700
They're all going

33:55.700 --> 33:56.700
I don't know how they did that

33:56.700 --> 33:57.700
And I literally mean

33:57.700 --> 33:58.700
I don't know how they did that

33:58.700 --> 33:59.700
I don't know if that was a practical car

33:59.700 --> 34:00.700
Flipping through the air

34:00.700 --> 34:02.700
Or maybe the tire was CG

34:02.700 --> 34:03.700
But the car wasn't

34:03.700 --> 34:06.700
Weirdly, I know something about that

34:06.700 --> 34:09.700
Which I usually don't

34:09.700 --> 34:11.700
But I happen to know something about that

34:11.700 --> 34:13.700
Because of Genevieve Pearson

34:13.700 --> 34:15.700
Who you know

34:15.700 --> 34:17.700
Genevieve, we love Genevieve from

34:17.700 --> 34:19.700
King of the Nerds

34:19.700 --> 34:20.700
And she did some research on it

34:20.700 --> 34:27.700
Every car effect is practical

34:27.700 --> 34:29.700
They may have layered stuff over it

34:29.700 --> 34:33.700
But all of the car stuff is practical

34:33.700 --> 34:35.700
There are other things that are CGI

34:35.700 --> 34:38.700
But a vast amount of that movie

34:38.700 --> 34:40.700
Was actual practical stuff

34:40.700 --> 34:42.700
And the guitar guy

34:42.700 --> 34:43.700
And the guitar guy

34:43.700 --> 34:44.700
Was a real guy

34:44.700 --> 34:46.700
We love the guitar guy

34:46.700 --> 34:50.700
You would expect a movie like that to be

34:50.700 --> 34:52.700
It just doesn't look like

34:52.700 --> 34:55.700
To me, I'm not a big fan of his movies

34:55.700 --> 34:59.700
But it doesn't look like a CGI movie to me

34:59.700 --> 35:02.700
Even at the parts where I know it has to be

35:02.700 --> 35:04.700
There are moments of that movie

35:04.700 --> 35:06.700
That I thought were just beautiful

35:06.700 --> 35:08.700
It seems like the camera is always

35:08.700 --> 35:09.700
In the perfect position

35:09.700 --> 35:12.700
Which is the effect of the CG

35:12.700 --> 35:16.700
With media scape

35:16.700 --> 35:18.700
Entourage on the other hand

35:18.700 --> 35:21.700
All CG

35:21.700 --> 35:24.700
Including the script

35:24.700 --> 35:29.700
Wow

35:29.700 --> 35:31.700
I don't know where those three booze

35:31.700 --> 35:33.700
Were coming from

35:33.700 --> 35:35.700
I have never seen a frame of entourage

35:35.700 --> 35:38.700
And I'm fine

35:38.700 --> 35:40.700
Oh, you got some binging to do

35:40.700 --> 35:42.700
I told that to somebody

35:42.700 --> 35:43.700
And they said, actually

35:43.700 --> 35:45.700
They kind of studied me for a second

35:45.700 --> 35:47.700
As they mulled it over in their head

35:47.700 --> 35:49.700
And they said, I think you're

35:49.700 --> 35:51.700
Experiencing entourage the right way

35:51.700 --> 35:55.700
It's like trickling through the water table

35:55.700 --> 35:56.700
To you

35:56.700 --> 35:58.700
It's like, you don't need to see any episodes

35:58.700 --> 35:59.700
It's more of a...

35:59.700 --> 36:01.700
That's how I experience the real housewives

36:01.700 --> 36:03.700
I never actually watch them

36:03.700 --> 36:05.700
I just kind of, for whatever reason

36:05.700 --> 36:06.700
If you live in this culture

36:06.700 --> 36:08.700
You sort of just know what's going on

36:08.700 --> 36:10.700
In the show shows?

36:10.700 --> 36:12.700
Yeah, there's no...

36:12.700 --> 36:14.700
So the movies are

36:14.700 --> 36:18.700
Visually

36:18.700 --> 36:20.700
Incredible

36:20.700 --> 36:22.700
And with the exception of your

36:22.700 --> 36:23.700
Odd Mad Max or two

36:23.700 --> 36:25.700
They're all kind of dumb

36:25.700 --> 36:26.700
Whereas TV

36:26.700 --> 36:27.700
Until we get...

36:27.700 --> 36:28.700
I don't know

36:28.700 --> 36:30.700
Because it's cheaper now

36:30.700 --> 36:31.700
And it's lower stakes

36:31.700 --> 36:33.700
It's getting really, you know

36:33.700 --> 36:34.700
Good

36:34.700 --> 36:37.700
He said at a weird octave

36:37.700 --> 36:38.700
And getting gooder

36:38.700 --> 36:41.700
It's getting good

36:41.700 --> 36:43.700
And there's lots of shitty shows

36:43.700 --> 36:44.700
But there's so many

36:44.700 --> 36:46.700
That there's something for everybody

36:46.700 --> 36:48.700
And there's all kinds of amazing stuff happening

36:48.700 --> 36:49.700
So

36:49.700 --> 36:51.700
One part of this Golden Age of TV

36:51.700 --> 36:53.700
Is serialization

36:53.700 --> 36:55.700
Like, you know one can argue

36:55.700 --> 36:57.700
That Breaking Bad wasn't a great show

36:57.700 --> 36:58.700
Well, someone can

36:58.700 --> 37:00.700
I'm sure

37:00.700 --> 37:03.700
Who is that person?

37:03.700 --> 37:06.700
Roger

37:06.700 --> 37:08.700
Roger

37:08.700 --> 37:09.700
Roger

37:09.700 --> 37:11.700
Roger

37:11.700 --> 37:13.700
That guy's an ass

37:13.700 --> 37:15.700
He probably doesn't like Breaking Bad

37:15.700 --> 37:16.700
Yeah

37:16.700 --> 37:17.700
Somebody's got to push back

37:17.700 --> 37:18.700
But anyways

37:18.700 --> 37:19.700
I'm saying like

37:19.700 --> 37:21.700
There's no more serialized show

37:21.700 --> 37:22.700
I mean, he just did Macbeth

37:22.700 --> 37:23.700
Over five years

37:23.700 --> 37:25.700
And slowly spiraled this character

37:25.700 --> 37:27.700
Into this beautiful

37:27.700 --> 37:28.700
Demise of spoilers

37:28.700 --> 37:30.700
But the...

37:30.700 --> 37:31.700
He breaks bad

37:31.700 --> 37:32.700
And then it gets worse

37:32.700 --> 37:36.700
But

37:36.700 --> 37:37.700
So here's me

37:37.700 --> 37:38.700
And it's not just because

37:38.700 --> 37:39.700
I'm a sitcom guy

37:39.700 --> 37:40.700
I don't think

37:40.700 --> 37:42.700
Like, I have this like

37:42.700 --> 37:43.700
Is it...

37:43.700 --> 37:46.700
Is my...

37:46.700 --> 37:48.700
Aversion to serialization

37:48.700 --> 37:50.700
Is my view of serialization

37:50.700 --> 37:51.700
As a crutch

37:51.700 --> 37:52.700
As bad craftsmanship

37:52.700 --> 37:53.700
Is that a...

37:53.700 --> 37:54.700
Is that now officially

37:54.700 --> 37:55.700
A hang-up that I have?

37:55.700 --> 37:57.700
So I need to let that go

37:57.700 --> 38:01.700
You just...

38:01.700 --> 38:03.700
George R.R. Martin is in the back

38:07.700 --> 38:09.700
What is it specifically

38:09.700 --> 38:10.700
About the serialization?

38:10.700 --> 38:12.700
It feels like cheating

38:12.700 --> 38:14.700
Because I grew up in the 80s

38:14.700 --> 38:16.700
On TV that was like

38:16.700 --> 38:18.700
So supremely crafted

38:18.700 --> 38:19.700
No matter how dumb it was

38:19.700 --> 38:21.700
There was a sense of craftsmanship

38:21.700 --> 38:23.700
Nobody in Shears ever made a...

38:23.700 --> 38:25.700
Picked up a Rubik's Cube

38:25.700 --> 38:27.700
Because it was in the headlines that week

38:27.700 --> 38:29.700
I'm sure there's...

38:29.700 --> 38:30.700
It's not like the shows aren't dated

38:30.700 --> 38:32.700
But there was also the...

38:32.700 --> 38:34.700
The attempt was for timelessness

38:34.700 --> 38:36.700
And the attempt was for perfect modularity usually

38:36.700 --> 38:38.700
And then when...

38:38.700 --> 38:40.700
It's that shark-jumping thing

38:40.700 --> 38:42.700
Or the actual etymology of shark-jumping

38:42.700 --> 38:43.700
Being from serialization

38:43.700 --> 38:45.700
When the shows start to get desperate

38:45.700 --> 38:47.700
They start saying to be continued

38:47.700 --> 38:49.700
And I guess that's the association I make

38:49.700 --> 38:51.700
It's like you're starting to...

38:51.700 --> 38:53.700
I started to feel like when

38:53.700 --> 38:55.700
The internet really started to threaten TV

38:55.700 --> 38:58.700
That's when we saw TV start to do like

38:58.700 --> 39:00.700
Really quickly

39:00.700 --> 39:02.700
It was all this like

39:02.700 --> 39:04.700
What I regard as a dirty trick on the audience

39:04.700 --> 39:06.700
To like throw some weird

39:06.700 --> 39:08.700
Nonsensical thing at the end of an episode

39:08.700 --> 39:10.700
And then go, huh?

39:10.700 --> 39:12.700
Now what are you going to watch next week?

39:12.700 --> 39:14.700
And it feels like you're holding them hostage

39:14.700 --> 39:16.700
It's not the same as Breaking Bad

39:16.700 --> 39:18.700
Which is like...

39:18.700 --> 39:20.700
But I've always...

39:20.700 --> 39:22.700
People have heard me rant about

39:22.700 --> 39:24.700
Everything I've ever ranted about

39:24.700 --> 39:26.700
That makes sense to me Breaking Bad broke that rule

39:26.700 --> 39:27.700
And did it well

39:27.700 --> 39:29.700
I think the difference is now that

39:29.700 --> 39:31.700
Because of the way we now watch TV

39:31.700 --> 39:33.700
You can watch it back to back

39:33.700 --> 39:35.700
And back in the day before DVRs

39:35.700 --> 39:37.700
Before streaming

39:37.700 --> 39:39.700
You missed episodes

39:39.700 --> 39:41.700
No one watched an entire run of any series

39:41.700 --> 39:43.700
Because you might be out one week

39:43.700 --> 39:45.700
You might miss a couple episodes

39:45.700 --> 39:47.700
So they had to be kind of self-contained

39:47.700 --> 39:49.700
So you could jump in and out

39:49.700 --> 39:51.700
And now you don't have to do that

39:51.700 --> 39:53.700
Most shows, if you really like a show

39:53.700 --> 39:55.700
You are going to watch every episode

39:55.700 --> 39:57.700
And there are fans who want to

39:57.700 --> 39:59.700
Get to know these characters

39:59.700 --> 40:01.700
And who want to go on this journey

40:01.700 --> 40:03.700
With these people

40:03.700 --> 40:05.700
I think there's something for everyone

40:05.700 --> 40:07.700
What's weird is even though

40:07.700 --> 40:09.700
All these shows now are serialized

40:09.700 --> 40:11.700
Shonda Rhimes is making billions

40:11.700 --> 40:13.700
Out of serialization

40:13.700 --> 40:15.700
But then you also have Dick Wolf

40:15.700 --> 40:17.700
Who suddenly has four shows on the air this fall

40:17.700 --> 40:19.700
All of those shows are actually still self-contained

40:19.700 --> 40:21.700
They all take place in Chicago

40:21.700 --> 40:23.700
So if you're like fire, then you got one

40:23.700 --> 40:25.700
If you're like PD, you got one

40:25.700 --> 40:27.700
That's much more like the serial

40:27.700 --> 40:29.700
Style of

40:29.700 --> 40:31.700
Pick whichever serial you like

40:31.700 --> 40:33.700
Do you think Dick Wolf is still actively making TV

40:33.700 --> 40:35.700
Or do you think he's in a glass coffin?

40:37.700 --> 40:39.700
Has anyone ever seen him?

40:39.700 --> 40:41.700
I think he's under Mount Rushmore

40:41.700 --> 40:43.700
And the people are fanning him

40:43.700 --> 40:45.700
Or pumping fluid

40:45.700 --> 40:47.700
Into some kind of chamber

40:47.700 --> 40:49.700
I don't even think there's scripts coming out

40:49.700 --> 40:51.700
I think it's just like

40:51.700 --> 40:53.700
Some young writer comes in

40:53.700 --> 40:55.700
And smears

40:55.700 --> 40:57.700
Some of the embalming fluid

40:57.700 --> 40:59.700
On his face like war paint

40:59.700 --> 41:01.700
And goes

41:01.700 --> 41:03.700
And then he charges out on a horse

41:03.700 --> 41:05.700
To a typewriter and creates a new law and order

41:09.700 --> 41:11.700
Please note

41:11.700 --> 41:13.700
I'm still saying Dick Wolf is a very valuable player

41:13.700 --> 41:15.700
In the television industry

41:15.700 --> 41:17.700
There is a contribution there

41:17.700 --> 41:19.700
I just think it's more spiritual

41:19.700 --> 41:21.700
Ritualistic probably

41:21.700 --> 41:23.700
He's making a lot of money

41:23.700 --> 41:25.700
He is out there

41:25.700 --> 41:27.700
He's kind of the master of it all

41:27.700 --> 41:29.700
You're not going to get me to

41:29.700 --> 41:31.700
Poopoo all over Dick Wolf

41:31.700 --> 41:33.700
Oh man, are you kidding me?

41:33.700 --> 41:35.700
I hope my work speaks for itself

41:35.700 --> 41:37.700
I've made love to Dick Wolf

41:37.700 --> 41:39.700
Several occasions

41:43.700 --> 41:45.700
I hope not during SBU though

41:45.700 --> 41:47.700
Just please not during SBU

41:47.700 --> 41:49.700
How much is his name though

41:49.700 --> 41:51.700
Because it's like perfect

41:51.700 --> 41:53.700
The episode's end

41:53.700 --> 41:55.700
He hung himself while masturbating

41:55.700 --> 41:57.700
And then it just says Dick Wolf

41:57.700 --> 41:59.700
It's like

41:59.700 --> 42:01.700
Such a visceral, it's like a mic drop

42:01.700 --> 42:03.700
It's like

42:03.700 --> 42:05.700
Dick Wolf

42:07.700 --> 42:09.700
Dick Wolf before he dicks you

42:09.700 --> 42:11.700
It would be too

42:11.700 --> 42:13.700
On the nose to

42:13.700 --> 42:15.700
If it was Wolf Dick

42:15.700 --> 42:17.700
This is childish

42:17.700 --> 42:19.700
So it still looks like a name

42:19.700 --> 42:21.700
But you're getting all those ingredients

42:21.700 --> 42:23.700
It's like Dick

42:23.700 --> 42:25.700
Wolf

42:25.700 --> 42:27.700
Pretty strong, right?

42:27.700 --> 42:29.700
Yeah, strong, strong

42:29.700 --> 42:31.700
It sends the subliminal signal

42:31.700 --> 42:33.700
I just watched a strong show

42:37.700 --> 42:39.700
That overreacts to the moon

42:39.700 --> 42:41.700
The

42:41.700 --> 42:43.700
Okay, so yeah, okay

42:43.700 --> 42:45.700
I've reached a verdict

42:45.700 --> 42:47.700
It's a hang up of mine for a bad reason

42:47.700 --> 42:49.700
In childhood, I was watching

42:49.700 --> 42:51.700
Television that was produced by people

42:51.700 --> 42:53.700
That were much like the people producing features

42:53.700 --> 42:55.700
Today, they were afraid

42:55.700 --> 42:57.700
To engage the audience

42:57.700 --> 42:59.700
Too much narratively

42:59.700 --> 43:01.700
Because it was ratings poison

43:01.700 --> 43:03.700
And that's not craftsmanship

43:03.700 --> 43:05.700
That's corporate

43:05.700 --> 43:07.700
Just manufacturing

43:07.700 --> 43:09.700
But that's like me saying

43:09.700 --> 43:11.700
I don't know, is it me or is Lucky Charms

43:11.700 --> 43:13.700
Better than Flay Mignon

43:13.700 --> 43:15.700
It's like, come on, don't be a dope

43:17.700 --> 43:19.700
I mean, I'm no foodie, but it's like

43:19.700 --> 43:21.700
Yeah

43:21.700 --> 43:23.700
I think because back when we were growing up

43:23.700 --> 43:25.700
Those serialized episodes

43:25.700 --> 43:27.700
Were pretty cheesy, pretty bad

43:27.700 --> 43:29.700
So to find out next week

43:29.700 --> 43:31.700
Whether or not Gordon Jump actually is molesting Dudley

43:31.700 --> 43:33.700
Right, they were

43:33.700 --> 43:35.700
Death rattles of desperate shows

43:35.700 --> 43:37.700
And it was sad to see

43:37.700 --> 43:39.700
Previous shows that a few weeks earlier

43:39.700 --> 43:41.700
Had cultural efficacy

43:41.700 --> 43:43.700
And now you're watching them wheeze

43:43.700 --> 43:45.700
And cough and tell you to

43:45.700 --> 43:47.700
I remember

43:47.700 --> 43:49.700
Different strokes was like, man

43:49.700 --> 43:51.700
It had a lot of death rattles

43:51.700 --> 43:53.700
There was that molestation episode

43:53.700 --> 43:55.700
And then there was Dudley and

43:55.700 --> 43:57.700
Dudley and Arnold both got

43:57.700 --> 43:59.700
Locked inside

43:59.700 --> 44:01.700
A car on the

44:01.700 --> 44:03.700
Knight Rider set

44:03.700 --> 44:05.700
They were visiting Knight Rider

44:05.700 --> 44:07.700
Because fuck it

44:11.700 --> 44:13.700
Because someone was just looking out the window

44:13.700 --> 44:15.700
In the different strokes Rider's room

44:15.700 --> 44:17.700
And then they looked at the clock

44:17.700 --> 44:19.700
And they were like, what if he went over there

44:21.700 --> 44:23.700
NBC Synergy

44:23.700 --> 44:25.700
Home by three productions

44:29.700 --> 44:31.700
But they

44:31.700 --> 44:33.700
It was so

44:33.700 --> 44:35.700
Ridiculous because Arnold got

44:35.700 --> 44:37.700
He visited Knight Rider

44:37.700 --> 44:39.700
Talked to Knight Rider

44:39.700 --> 44:41.700
I think they maintained within the fabric

44:41.700 --> 44:43.700
Of the show that Knight Rider is an actual

44:43.700 --> 44:45.700
Talking car

44:45.700 --> 44:47.700
I'm okay with that because it's like

44:47.700 --> 44:49.700
It's canon

44:49.700 --> 44:51.700
Different strokes canon

44:51.700 --> 44:53.700
Then he goes into a car

44:53.700 --> 44:55.700
I don't think it was a kit

44:55.700 --> 44:57.700
It was a different car

44:57.700 --> 44:59.700
And he gets locked in the car

44:59.700 --> 45:01.700
It's not even possible

45:01.700 --> 45:03.700
And then two crew

45:03.700 --> 45:05.700
Hands like walk up

45:05.700 --> 45:07.700
And go

45:07.700 --> 45:09.700
Hey, should I move this car?

45:09.700 --> 45:11.700
No, what are you crazy? That's the car we're going to blow up

45:11.700 --> 45:13.700
In the next scene

45:13.700 --> 45:15.700
And the audience goes

45:17.700 --> 45:19.700
They had the same reaction as they did to Dudley

45:19.700 --> 45:21.700
Getting molested

45:21.700 --> 45:23.700
Oh, that's the car they're going to blow up

45:23.700 --> 45:25.700
This is not how Hollywood works

45:25.700 --> 45:27.700
What is the Flintstones?

45:27.700 --> 45:29.700
Anyway, cars don't talk

45:29.700 --> 45:31.700
I'm Andy Rudy

45:31.700 --> 45:33.700
Remember

45:33.700 --> 45:35.700
There was the sitcom template

45:35.700 --> 45:37.700
Where someone got trapped in something

45:37.700 --> 45:39.700
And they were possibly going to die

45:39.700 --> 45:41.700
So on Punky Brewster

45:41.700 --> 45:43.700
Her friend got caught stuck in the refrigerator

45:43.700 --> 45:45.700
Of course

45:45.700 --> 45:47.700
I remember the Threes Company episode

45:47.700 --> 45:49.700
Where they were stuck in that freezer

45:49.700 --> 45:51.700
And they could have died

45:51.700 --> 45:53.700
It was number 72

45:53.700 --> 45:55.700
On the list of sitcom tropes

45:55.700 --> 45:57.700
It was a simpler world

45:57.700 --> 45:59.700
The Incredible Hulk won an Emmy

45:59.700 --> 46:01.700
For Best Dramatic Series

46:03.700 --> 46:05.700
Simpler time

46:05.700 --> 46:07.700
I think Lindsay Wagner

46:07.700 --> 46:09.700
Was at her name

46:09.700 --> 46:11.700
I think she got an Emmy for Best Actress

46:11.700 --> 46:13.700
In a dramatic series

46:13.700 --> 46:15.700
For Bionic Woman

46:15.700 --> 46:17.700
Anyways

46:19.700 --> 46:21.700
Derejevel, what do you think?

46:21.700 --> 46:23.700
Yeah

46:23.700 --> 46:25.700
I'm a fan

46:25.700 --> 46:27.700
Absolutely

46:27.700 --> 46:29.700
I like that friend of his

46:29.700 --> 46:31.700
He stopped after the pilot

46:31.700 --> 46:33.700
Because of that friend of his

46:33.700 --> 46:35.700
What do you mean?

46:35.700 --> 46:37.700
His friend just seems a little foggy

46:37.700 --> 46:39.700
Yeah

46:39.700 --> 46:41.700
I was a little thrown by his performance style

46:41.700 --> 46:43.700
Yeah

46:43.700 --> 46:45.700
I'm lowering my voice because

46:45.700 --> 46:47.700
Because Marvel lawyers are listening

46:47.700 --> 46:49.700
No, it's because

46:49.700 --> 46:51.700
I get the distinct impression

46:51.700 --> 46:53.700
He's probably a fan

46:57.700 --> 46:59.700
Just because

46:59.700 --> 47:01.700
He's acting a lot

47:01.700 --> 47:03.700
Like a guy wandering around Comic Con

47:03.700 --> 47:05.700
Not so much like a professional actor

47:05.700 --> 47:07.700
He just kind of stumbled on set

47:07.700 --> 47:09.700
Yeah

47:09.700 --> 47:11.700
He's supposed to be the comic relief

47:11.700 --> 47:13.700
Call me your hair

47:13.700 --> 47:15.700
Knock it back

47:15.700 --> 47:17.700
Bangs are flying all over the place

47:17.700 --> 47:19.700
I don't know

47:19.700 --> 47:21.700
I'm talking about him

47:21.700 --> 47:23.700
He'll become your favorite character

47:23.700 --> 47:25.700
He gets better and better

47:25.700 --> 47:27.700
Fine

47:27.700 --> 47:29.700
I think of all the

47:29.700 --> 47:31.700
comic book adaptations

47:31.700 --> 47:33.700
To me, The Flash

47:33.700 --> 47:35.700
They killed it in Season 1

47:35.700 --> 47:37.700
I haven't seen it

47:37.700 --> 47:39.700
They did a really great job

47:39.700 --> 47:41.700
It's a lot of fun

47:41.700 --> 47:43.700
It's so accessible

47:43.700 --> 47:45.700
I watch it with my 5 year old

47:45.700 --> 47:47.700
I don't know if I'm dad of the year

47:47.700 --> 47:49.700
There is some death on the show

47:49.700 --> 47:51.700
There are times where I'm

47:51.700 --> 47:53.700
Wondering if I'm

47:53.700 --> 47:55.700
Injuring this kid

47:55.700 --> 47:57.700
But he enjoys it

47:57.700 --> 47:59.700
What are The Flash's

47:59.700 --> 48:01.700
Limitations

48:01.700 --> 48:03.700
That seems like a pretty extreme

48:03.700 --> 48:05.700
Super power to just be able to do

48:05.700 --> 48:07.700
Everything faster than everybody else

48:07.700 --> 48:09.700
That's right next to

48:09.700 --> 48:11.700
Flying

48:13.700 --> 48:15.700
Do people just sometimes stick their arm out

48:15.700 --> 48:17.700
And wait

48:17.700 --> 48:19.700
And that's like his kryptonite

48:19.700 --> 48:21.700
Is it a patient close line

48:21.700 --> 48:23.700
There's a lot of baddies out there

48:23.700 --> 48:25.700
There's the reverse flash

48:25.700 --> 48:27.700
What does reverse flash do

48:27.700 --> 48:29.700
What does he do

48:29.700 --> 48:31.700
Same speed backwards

48:31.700 --> 48:33.700
Or super slow

48:35.700 --> 48:37.700
That would be great

48:37.700 --> 48:39.700
There was a flash

48:39.700 --> 48:41.700
There's a flash villain

48:41.700 --> 48:43.700
In the comic book world

48:43.700 --> 48:45.700
You're a big fan of this character

48:45.700 --> 48:47.700
What was his name

48:47.700 --> 48:49.700
The Turtle

48:49.700 --> 48:51.700
The Tortoise

48:51.700 --> 48:53.700
He was the world's slowest criminal

48:53.700 --> 48:55.700
I've only read the description

48:55.700 --> 48:57.700
I've never seen it in the comic book

48:57.700 --> 48:59.700
It was like give me a break

48:59.700 --> 49:01.700
He was a great nemesis to flash

49:01.700 --> 49:03.700
Because as described

49:03.700 --> 49:05.700
He's so slow

49:05.700 --> 49:07.700
That flash

49:07.700 --> 49:09.700
Would get to the scene of the crime

49:09.700 --> 49:11.700
Investigate it

49:11.700 --> 49:13.700
And leave before the turtle

49:13.700 --> 49:15.700
Ever got there

49:17.700 --> 49:19.700
That's pretty slow

49:19.700 --> 49:21.700
That's actually

49:21.700 --> 49:23.700
He's not a criminal at all

49:23.700 --> 49:25.700
That's the time

49:25.700 --> 49:27.700
Space continuum

49:27.700 --> 49:29.700
Flash's nemesis is just people who haven't done anything yet

49:29.700 --> 49:31.700
That's not

49:31.700 --> 49:33.700
He's just an impatient guy

49:33.700 --> 49:35.700
That's person of interest

49:35.700 --> 49:37.700
Seriously what is reverse flash

49:37.700 --> 49:39.700
What does that mean to be a reverse flash

49:39.700 --> 49:41.700
The character

49:41.700 --> 49:43.700
The guy from Ed

49:43.700 --> 49:45.700
Whose name is escaping me right now

49:45.700 --> 49:47.700
Tom Kavanaugh

49:47.700 --> 49:49.700
Are we giving away spoilers by the way

49:49.700 --> 49:51.700
Because I'm realizing

49:51.700 --> 49:53.700
I know exactly

49:53.700 --> 49:55.700
Spoiler alert

49:55.700 --> 49:57.700
The first season hinges on reverse flash

49:57.700 --> 49:59.700
And what he is

49:59.700 --> 50:01.700
Fine

50:01.700 --> 50:07.700
So what are white walkers

50:07.700 --> 50:09.700
How do they work

50:09.700 --> 50:11.700
And how do you kill them

50:11.700 --> 50:13.700
How are you feeling

50:13.700 --> 50:15.700
About Game of Thrones right now

50:15.700 --> 50:17.700
I'm behind right now

50:17.700 --> 50:19.700
And we're missing tonight too

50:19.700 --> 50:21.700
A couple episodes behind

50:21.700 --> 50:23.700
There's been some controversy about Game of Thrones

50:23.700 --> 50:25.700
I guess it's just inevitable

50:25.700 --> 50:27.700
The show was so flawless for so long

50:27.700 --> 50:29.700
And everybody's eyes

50:29.700 --> 50:31.700
There's like two lobes

50:31.700 --> 50:33.700
To the controversy as far as I can understand it

50:33.700 --> 50:35.700
One is

50:35.700 --> 50:37.700
That they're starting

50:37.700 --> 50:39.700
They're departing from the books

50:39.700 --> 50:41.700
More and more

50:41.700 --> 50:43.700
I don't know if it's accurate to say more and more

50:43.700 --> 50:45.700
But I thought I heard something that their plan

50:45.700 --> 50:47.700
Was to actually depart from them

50:47.700 --> 50:49.700
To an extent that it would be okay to just coexist

50:49.700 --> 50:51.700
Yeah and you kind of have to at some point

50:51.700 --> 50:53.700
But I'm curious what you guys think

50:53.700 --> 50:55.700
Are you guys cool with them going in a different direction

50:55.700 --> 50:57.700
Than the books

50:57.700 --> 50:59.700
They're almost caught up to the books anyway right

50:59.700 --> 51:01.700
So wouldn't they have to

51:01.700 --> 51:03.700
Right I mean that's the thing too

51:03.700 --> 51:05.700
He's racing to finish the next book

51:05.700 --> 51:07.700
But then you know at some point

51:07.700 --> 51:09.700
All these shows have to go in their own direction

51:09.700 --> 51:11.700
I mean that's the thing about Walking Dead as well

51:11.700 --> 51:13.700
Is that the treat is

51:13.700 --> 51:15.700
They do sort of honor the comics

51:15.700 --> 51:17.700
But at the same time they've gone in a different direction

51:17.700 --> 51:19.700
They've created new characters

51:19.700 --> 51:21.700
They've sort of taken things from the comics

51:21.700 --> 51:23.700
And sort of switched them around

51:23.700 --> 51:25.700
Changed the timetable

51:25.700 --> 51:27.700
It's enjoyable for both

51:27.700 --> 51:29.700
It's an opportunity to have two different sort of

51:29.700 --> 51:31.700
Paths for that

51:31.700 --> 51:33.700
You know that genre

51:33.700 --> 51:35.700
Yeah the other lobe of the controversy

51:35.700 --> 51:37.700
Was a really specific thing of like the brutality

51:37.700 --> 51:39.700
Of the which and I think

51:39.700 --> 51:41.700
I think the reason why it was so controversial

51:41.700 --> 51:43.700
Is because also it wasn't

51:43.700 --> 51:45.700
In the books so that's kind of the definition

51:45.700 --> 51:47.700
Of gratuitous

51:47.700 --> 51:49.700
Was Sansa's wedding night

51:49.700 --> 51:51.700
Was in this like her third wedding night

51:51.700 --> 51:53.700
Sansa hasn't had

51:53.700 --> 51:55.700
A good life

51:55.700 --> 51:57.700
And so

51:57.700 --> 51:59.700
There was her wedding night to

51:59.700 --> 52:01.700
Shitbag

52:01.700 --> 52:03.700
Yeah Ramsey

52:03.700 --> 52:05.700
Cool name, bad guy

52:05.700 --> 52:07.700
She you know he

52:07.700 --> 52:09.700
Whatever but if you don't know

52:09.700 --> 52:11.700
It doesn't matter it's a brutal

52:11.700 --> 52:13.700
It's not a great consensual

52:13.700 --> 52:15.700
Kind of wedding night

52:15.700 --> 52:17.700
And now so

52:17.700 --> 52:19.700
Cinematically as far as what happens

52:19.700 --> 52:21.700
On the screen it's actually one of the least

52:21.700 --> 52:23.700
Gratuitous things in the Game of Thrones history

52:23.700 --> 52:25.700
There's a shot of him ripping up in the back of her dress

52:25.700 --> 52:27.700
And then the rest is played on her

52:27.700 --> 52:29.700
Terrified face which is all the more brutal

52:29.700 --> 52:31.700
And also

52:31.700 --> 52:33.700
It's like yeah it's like the rest of the show

52:33.700 --> 52:35.700
Is just like actual reverse cowgirl action

52:35.700 --> 52:37.700
And people everyone you know one can

52:37.700 --> 52:39.700
Actually ever have sex in Game of Thrones

52:39.700 --> 52:41.700
Everyone someone's always walking in

52:41.700 --> 52:43.700
Um

52:43.700 --> 52:45.700
But I

52:45.700 --> 52:47.700
So I

52:47.700 --> 52:49.700
I was like okay so it wasn't in the book

52:49.700 --> 52:51.700
Okay and then there's a lot of argument

52:51.700 --> 52:53.700
Of like well we already knew Ramsey was bad

52:53.700 --> 52:55.700
Why are we doing this

52:55.700 --> 52:57.700
And you certainly don't want to dance near the

52:57.700 --> 52:59.700
Hot button of like the emerging

52:59.700 --> 53:01.700
Feminism and stuff and I don't want to take that stuff lightly

53:01.700 --> 53:03.700
Or dismiss it for dumb reasons

53:03.700 --> 53:05.700
But I will say

53:05.700 --> 53:07.700
I feel like the whole Game of Thrones series

53:07.700 --> 53:09.700
Not being not a guy

53:09.700 --> 53:11.700
That read the books like when I watch the show

53:11.700 --> 53:13.700
I feel like those two sisters

53:13.700 --> 53:15.700
Arya and Sansa

53:15.700 --> 53:17.700
That the whole series is like

53:17.700 --> 53:19.700
It's this like to me

53:19.700 --> 53:21.700
The whole point of that show

53:21.700 --> 53:23.700
Is that I'm waiting for the two of them

53:23.700 --> 53:25.700
To enter the same room again

53:25.700 --> 53:27.700
After all these years because one of them

53:27.700 --> 53:29.700
In the beginning of the show

53:29.700 --> 53:31.700
Is just a standard like oh I'm

53:31.700 --> 53:33.700
The princess archetype and my value

53:33.700 --> 53:35.700
Is in learning to sew and I'm going to get married off

53:35.700 --> 53:37.700
And I'm a diplomat and I'm going to learn how to

53:37.700 --> 53:39.700
How to consolidate power from my family

53:39.700 --> 53:41.700
Because I'm pretty and blah blah blah

53:41.700 --> 53:43.700
And then the other girl is like I want to shoot arrows

53:43.700 --> 53:45.700
You're not allowed to shoot arrows and it's like okay

53:45.700 --> 53:47.700
We resonate with them

53:47.700 --> 53:49.700
And then the shit just hits the fan

53:49.700 --> 53:51.700
And these two girls in particular

53:51.700 --> 53:53.700
They're separated and now we're just

53:53.700 --> 53:55.700
Watching them like Arya has now become

53:55.700 --> 53:57.700
Like this weird ninja assassin

53:57.700 --> 53:59.700
That's like learning how to like bender

53:59.700 --> 54:01.700
Mind so she can poison people or whatever

54:01.700 --> 54:03.700
And like and Sansa is

54:03.700 --> 54:05.700
Like is no less

54:05.700 --> 54:07.700
A hero and by virtue

54:07.700 --> 54:09.700
Of the tragedy that's befalling her

54:09.700 --> 54:11.700
It's like it's two it's like the darkest

54:11.700 --> 54:13.700
Versions of their little fantasies

54:13.700 --> 54:15.700
We were watching them before their lives

54:15.700 --> 54:17.700
Went to hell and so

54:17.700 --> 54:19.700
For that one reason

54:19.700 --> 54:21.700
I was like well you know what

54:21.700 --> 54:23.700
The more bad shit that happens to Sansa

54:23.700 --> 54:25.700
The better like maybe

54:25.700 --> 54:27.700
That's the point or I don't know

54:29.700 --> 54:31.700
I think the thing is

54:31.700 --> 54:33.700
You're right it's a very delicate

54:33.700 --> 54:35.700
Topic especially right now

54:35.700 --> 54:37.700
In society and in the world and you

54:37.700 --> 54:39.700
Have to be prepared to

54:39.700 --> 54:41.700
Either justify it or

54:41.700 --> 54:43.700
Be sort of cognizant

54:43.700 --> 54:45.700
That this is going to create a controversy

54:45.700 --> 54:47.700
And you better have

54:47.700 --> 54:49.700
Sort of your explanation ready

54:49.700 --> 54:51.700
You better be ready to sort of explain it

54:51.700 --> 54:53.700
And sometimes I'm surprised

54:53.700 --> 54:55.700
When networks or producers are caught off guard

54:55.700 --> 54:57.700
By controversy when you can

54:57.700 --> 54:59.700
Sort of see it a mile away

54:59.700 --> 55:01.700
And in this age of social media

55:01.700 --> 55:03.700
Anything can become a controversy

55:03.700 --> 55:05.700
So you always have to be ready to

55:05.700 --> 55:07.700
Explain yourself and

55:07.700 --> 55:09.700
Justify the direction

55:09.700 --> 55:11.700
You want to show so that's where

55:11.700 --> 55:13.700
I kind of sort of still don't understand

55:13.700 --> 55:15.700
Is when people aren't ready to

55:15.700 --> 55:17.700
Have they had a response

55:17.700 --> 55:19.700
Has there been a response from the production side

55:19.700 --> 55:21.700
To the controversy? Has anyone issued a statement

55:21.700 --> 55:23.700
Saying like look here's

55:23.700 --> 55:25.700
Leave us alone we're Game of Thrones or anything

55:25.700 --> 55:27.700
Have they said anything?

55:27.700 --> 55:29.700
They've come out and said

55:29.700 --> 55:31.700
We apologize if we have offended

55:31.700 --> 55:33.700
People that wasn't

55:33.700 --> 55:35.700
The purpose of the storyline

55:35.700 --> 55:37.700
Sort of the usual sort of explanation

55:37.700 --> 55:39.700
And so

55:39.700 --> 55:41.700
You know they're big

55:41.700 --> 55:43.700
You know so

55:43.700 --> 55:45.700
I have a question

55:45.700 --> 55:47.700
I thought

55:47.700 --> 55:49.700
Thank you Curtis

55:49.700 --> 55:51.700
Well I was just wondering something

55:51.700 --> 55:53.700
Because I might be wrong because I'm

55:53.700 --> 55:55.700
Way behind I'm still in the books

55:55.700 --> 55:57.700
But

55:57.700 --> 55:59.700
My question is

55:59.700 --> 56:01.700
My question is that the problem

56:01.700 --> 56:03.700
With this particular case

56:03.700 --> 56:05.700
Was that it actually

56:05.700 --> 56:07.700
Instantly corrected

56:07.700 --> 56:09.700
That it was something that in the books

56:09.700 --> 56:11.700
Did not happen to that character

56:11.700 --> 56:13.700
It was something that was imposed

56:13.700 --> 56:15.700
On the character is that correct

56:15.700 --> 56:17.700
So that was the reason

56:17.700 --> 56:19.700
For the controversy it wasn't the fact

56:19.700 --> 56:21.700
That it was a rape or how

56:21.700 --> 56:23.700
Visually brutal it was

56:23.700 --> 56:25.700
It was that they arbitrarily

56:25.700 --> 56:27.700
Took another character and gave

56:27.700 --> 56:29.700
The rape to this character

56:29.700 --> 56:31.700
Yeah I think it was all the above

56:31.700 --> 56:33.700
That it was sort of just you know

56:33.700 --> 56:35.700
The form of this was going to incite

56:35.700 --> 56:37.700
Some concern out there and on social

56:37.700 --> 56:39.700
Media especially you know this is

56:39.700 --> 56:41.700
An age of social media as you know Dan

56:41.700 --> 56:43.700
That you know and that's

56:43.700 --> 56:45.700
Actually it's weird you know it's like

56:45.700 --> 56:47.700
With Sopranos, Deadwood, Game of Thrones

56:47.700 --> 56:49.700
I mean

56:49.700 --> 56:51.700
I'm not defending anything

56:51.700 --> 56:53.700
But the word

56:53.700 --> 56:55.700
For the other side is that it's like come on

56:55.700 --> 56:57.700
What are we getting high on when we're watching

56:57.700 --> 56:59.700
These shows it's like

56:59.700 --> 57:01.700
You know there's a point when

57:01.700 --> 57:03.700
Like it looks like

57:03.700 --> 57:05.700
I'm trying to avoid spoilers so I'm just

57:05.700 --> 57:07.700
Speaking of very general things but there's a

57:07.700 --> 57:09.700
Point when it looks like

57:09.700 --> 57:11.700
Peter Dinklage might die

57:11.700 --> 57:13.700
And that's not a spoiler it's just

57:13.700 --> 57:15.700
Like he's in a tough physical spot

57:15.700 --> 57:17.700
And I found myself going like you know what

57:17.700 --> 57:19.700
This could be it and that's

57:19.700 --> 57:21.700
What makes that show so amazing that's what made

57:21.700 --> 57:23.700
Breaking Bad really interesting it's like

57:23.700 --> 57:25.700
The brutality and the randomness

57:25.700 --> 57:27.700
The chaos it's like

57:27.700 --> 57:29.700
Holy shit like I don't know

57:29.700 --> 57:31.700
That shows first season ends in one of

57:31.700 --> 57:33.700
The biggest like

57:33.700 --> 57:35.700
What the fucks in TV

57:35.700 --> 57:37.700
History because you're like what

57:37.700 --> 57:39.700
He was Michael Thrones

57:43.700 --> 57:45.700
You killed Michael Thrones

57:45.700 --> 57:47.700
It's his game

57:47.700 --> 57:49.700
Cersei

57:49.700 --> 57:51.700
Literally five minutes earlier told him

57:51.700 --> 57:53.700
To give him the Game of Thrones speech

57:53.700 --> 57:55.700
Remember she's like if you're going to play this

57:55.700 --> 57:57.700
Game of Thrones I suggest you be very

57:57.700 --> 57:59.700
Careful and he's like okay I will be

57:59.700 --> 58:01.700
Careful skunk

58:01.700 --> 58:03.700
And we were like holy shit

58:03.700 --> 58:05.700
And we were like you know we're tearing

58:05.700 --> 58:07.700
In our shirts and we're like freaking out

58:07.700 --> 58:09.700
And then we just like sacked Aaron waited

58:09.700 --> 58:11.700
For the next season because we're like holy shit

58:11.700 --> 58:13.700
And it's happened a thousand times in that

58:13.700 --> 58:15.700
Show since then and so

58:15.700 --> 58:17.700
That's the only I'm neither

58:17.700 --> 58:19.700
Defending nor

58:19.700 --> 58:21.700
Nor attacking because of the

58:21.700 --> 58:23.700
Sensitivity of the issue and it's like

58:23.700 --> 58:25.700
I don't want to mansplain

58:25.700 --> 58:27.700
About any of that stuff

58:27.700 --> 58:29.700
I don't want to stay on the TV

58:29.700 --> 58:31.700
Like consumer side of this

58:31.700 --> 58:33.700
Thing and none of my business on the

58:33.700 --> 58:35.700
Gender side

58:35.700 --> 58:37.700
But that's the other thing to consider

58:37.700 --> 58:39.700
Is just like you know the fucking

58:39.700 --> 58:41.700
Like brutality

58:41.700 --> 58:43.700
We can't

58:43.700 --> 58:45.700
Because the argument I keep hearing is like

58:45.700 --> 58:47.700
Come on give me a break we already knew that guy was a bad guy

58:47.700 --> 58:49.700
I'm like well that's come on

58:49.700 --> 58:51.700
By that argument

58:51.700 --> 58:53.700
Oscar the Grouch is as bad as it should get

58:53.700 --> 58:55.700
Because he's like

58:55.700 --> 58:57.700
If you want to freak

58:57.700 --> 58:59.700
People out Oscar's got a like

58:59.700 --> 59:01.700
Lunge at Big Bridge throat and everyone's like

59:01.700 --> 59:03.700
I'll be like I fucking hate birds

59:03.700 --> 59:05.700
Because I'm racist

59:05.700 --> 59:07.700
Just blood everywhere

59:07.700 --> 59:09.700
A series finale of Sesame Street

59:09.700 --> 59:11.700
Fade to black

59:13.700 --> 59:15.700
Why don't we bring out media correspondent

59:15.700 --> 59:27.700
Spencer Crittenden

59:27.700 --> 59:29.700
Is that

59:29.700 --> 59:31.700
I walked in with a bag

59:31.700 --> 59:33.700
I brought a paper bag it says Hannah on it

59:33.700 --> 59:35.700
In Sharpie

59:35.700 --> 59:37.700
It's not an emergency is Hannah here

59:37.700 --> 59:39.700
Okay there's Hannah

59:39.700 --> 59:41.700
Erin packed a little bag for her

59:41.700 --> 59:43.700
Okay good

59:43.700 --> 59:45.700
I thought I'd use Spencer's sit down time

59:45.700 --> 59:47.700
Is that it does it say Hannah on it

59:47.700 --> 59:49.700
This is below your pay grade

59:49.700 --> 59:51.700
You're a comptroller

59:51.700 --> 59:53.700
But you can hand it off

59:53.700 --> 59:55.700
There it goes to Marissa

59:55.700 --> 59:57.700
We have like a whole congregation I know people's names

59:57.700 --> 59:59.700
Oh that's for Erin

59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.700
That's the backpack

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.700
Is that just a drug deal that happened

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.700
I had this idea where you could sell cocaine

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.700
Out of a bowling alley

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.700
By putting it in the shoes

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.700
And this is very similar

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.700
To that whole methodology

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.700
What TV shows are you watching Spencer

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.700
Oh you know

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.700
I don't know

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.700
I just started watching Silicon Valley

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.700
I just got caught up

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.700
Yeah Game of Thrones

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.700
Okay

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.700
Not spoilers

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.700
It's been said that obsidian can kill

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.700
Those white walkers

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.700
And they've revealed arrowheads made of obsidian

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.700
And spoiler alert

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.700
Sometimes the white walkers

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.700
Watch things they just stand there

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.700
Watching stuff happening

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.700
Why can't they just shoot them in the fucking face

01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.700
With obsidian arrows

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:01.700
It'd be done it'd be over

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.700
No more game

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.700
You mean like the

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.700
Leaders

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.700
They just stand there

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.700
Assholes

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.700
I don't know

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.700
When I saw those obsidian arrowheads

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.700
I was like what the fuck are you idiots doing

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.700
If you didn't show the arrowheads

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.700
I wouldn't have this question in my brain

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.700
Okay sorry

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.700
I know but I mean there's only a limited

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.700
Supply of white walkers

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.700
There's not infinite of them

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.700
You could just four arrows done

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.700
Yeah

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.700
Okay sorry everybody

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.700
All I've been thinking about you guys

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.700
Is just

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.700
Just Minecraft

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.700
Just Minecraft Blood Magic

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.700
Alright shit, alright

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.700
Well it's 9-11

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.700
Yay

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.700
It's always off putting to the new guests

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.700
It's just 9-11

01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.700
And there is no hidden layer to it

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.700
They cheer at 9-11 because we've trained them too

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.700
And

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.700
The goal is just to be bad people

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:07.700
Like

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.700
Alright so

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.700
Golden Age of TV

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.700
But Silicon Valley by the way

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.700
Having a great second season

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.700
I'm way behind on that

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.700
I haven't watched since the finale of the first one

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.700
It's good man

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.700
I'm kind of scared

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:25.700
I need to hear that before I dive in

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.700
Because like Kumil is a very good friend of the show

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.700
And it's like if I have like a

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.700
What if I hate it

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.700
I mean not hate, like his parts are better this season

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.700
I think

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.700
He's always perfect

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.700
Come back Kumil

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.700
And Dreamy

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.700
What are you guys thinking about this season

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.700
Of Orphan Black

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.700
Boo

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.700
Oh my god I love that

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.700
You love Orphan Black

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.700
I love Orphan Black

01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.700
It's a great show

01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.700
It's really getting into the weeds though

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.700
So I feel like

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.700
The last not this past Saturday's episode

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.700
But the week before

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.700
I felt like they were getting back on track

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.700
So fingers crossed

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.700
I'm in it for good

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.700
I feel like maybe now

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.700
They're getting back on track

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.700
There wasn't enough Alice in this season

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.700
Oh no but you know what

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.700
They've got more Helena

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.700
And Helena is now my favorite

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.700
Oh my god I love her so much

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:29.700
I love Tatiana Maslany

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.700
I'm sorry but I love Tatiana Maslany

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.700
I get

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.700
I think it's good with olive oil

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.700
Just a little salt

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:41.700
Tatiana Mosalini

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.700
For the whole table

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.700
So are you married

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.700
Schneidi? Yes

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:53.700
To a lady? Yes

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.700
See how modern I am

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.700
Look at you

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.700
Speaking of gay marriage

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.700
I thought of one more reason to support it

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.700
While I was getting dressed

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.700
A couple days ago

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.700
80% of all straight marriages

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.700
Are gross people

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.700
And all gay marriages

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.700
Are adorable

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.700
I've never seen a gay couple

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.700
And I'm not talking about

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:27.700
Because they're good looking people

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.700
I've never seen a gay couple

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.700
And gone like those two are

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.700
Those two suck

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.700
But I all constantly

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.700
Universal city walk

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.700
Is just a parade of shit bags

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:41.700
And they're all straight married couples

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:43.700
I mean what are we protecting

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.700
Alright anyways

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:47.700
That was my culture segment

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.700
I think that's a big city walk issue

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.700
Like did you see that

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:53.700
Documentary with George Decay

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.700
George Decay and his husband

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.700
They're goddamn adorable

01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.700
Is that condescending to say

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.700
Is that a new form of homophobia

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.700
Is that infantilizing them?

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.700
George Decay is the best though

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.700
I'm not saying they're adorable

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.700
As human beings to dehumanize

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.700
I'm saying their marriage is adorable

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.700
He's adorable

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:23.700
So when you come home to your wife

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.700
And she's like

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:27.700
I was going to endow her

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.700
As like washing dishes

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.700
But then I started spiraling into

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.700
Feminist reaction

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.700
But I'm saying she finished her job

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:37.700
As like a powerful attorney

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.700
And she's just

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.700
A little bit of protein on a plate

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.700
Cleaning her own plate

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:45.700
That's what you guys do

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.700
She's a graphic designer

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:49.700
She's washing a dish

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.700
And she's not good at it

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.700
She's like

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.700
Fuck

01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.700
Fuck

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.700
And

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.700
I just wanted to put her in a position

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.700
Where you guys are a sweet married couple

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.700
And you're coming up behind her

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.700
Like you're going to what tonight

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.700
Dan Harmon

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:13.700
What is that?

01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.700
Do you ever come up behind her

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.700
And put your hands over her eyes

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.700
And then

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.700
Sweetly whisper in her ear

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:23.700
Is your schnity sense tingling?

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.700
As coined by Dan Harmon

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.700
I really want to make this happen

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.700
It's funny

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.700
You tweeted that out to me

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.700
But then there were Michael Schneiders

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.700
Actually tweeted back at you

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.700
And thanking you I guess

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.700
It was

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.700
The schnity sense

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.700
I think it's how you should open all of your columns

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.700
Anything that you write you should say

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.700
Hey is your schnity sense tingling

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:55.700
Whatever panel I moderate

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.700
From here on out at Comic Con

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.700
That's all

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.700
Hey is your schnity sense tingling

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.700
Hey it's me Mike Schneider

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.700
Another rape on Game of Thrones last night

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.700
And the fans are a buzz

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:09.700
Stay tuned

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:13.700
Alright

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.700
I was actually bringing up your wife

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.700
Because I was just curious

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.700
She's a graphic designer

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.700
I'm assuming she's kind of a TV buff

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.700
Or maybe not I don't know

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.700
We watch a lot of TV together

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.700
But the problem is we fall asleep in front of the TV at different times

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.700
So then we can't actually ever delete anything on the DVR

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.700
Because I got to watch

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.700
All that episode she didn't

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.700
There was something I didn't

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.700
And so we were never

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.700
Actually deleting anything

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.700
I don't have a point to that story

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.700
It's just reality folks

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.700
Are you a positive TV viewer

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.700
Like when you're watching are you always

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.700
You don't seem like a very judgmental

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:51.700
I'm not a critic so that helps

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.700
I don't have to critique shows

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.700
But you don't watch it through that lens

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.700
Of like grumble grumble grumble

01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:59.700
Or snarky snarky snarky snark

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.700
No for the most part not

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:03.700
If I had a bad run in with someone

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.700
Then it kind of

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.700
It does maybe cloud a little bit

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.700
My viewing pleasure

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.700
Example! Example! Example!

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.700
They're clapping but they're not chanting

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.700
They're not so

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.700
They like my chanting

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.700
I think we're supposed to do a jig at that point

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.700
You can't give an example

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.700
I probably can't

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:29.700
Vince Gilligan was like

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:31.700
He mistook you for a waiter

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.700
At a luncheon

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:35.700
Exactly, no Vince is like

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.700
One of the sweetest guys

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:39.700
I know!

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:41.700
Why does the best TV writer

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.700
Have to also be the nicest

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.700
It fucks up everything for everybody

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.700
Cause it's like oh Dan why are you

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.700
An asshole

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.700
Clearly no actual reason

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:55.700
Before Vince Gilligan like

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.700
Brovio popped you know

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.700
Your congeniality

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.700
It was a myth

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:05.700
That you could perpetuate

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.700
I'm too talented to be nice

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:09.700
But now he's just like

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.700
I don't know I love making TV

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.700
And he makes the darkest TV

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.700
I'm the luckiest guy in the world

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:23.700
You introduced me to Vince Gilligan

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:25.700
Which is like the biggest favor

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:27.700
Cause then he ended up doing a

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.700
Prospector on Community

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:31.700
And he's so awesome

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.700
I never did get my finders fee

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.700
You don't consider this a reward

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.700
Me bringing you out

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.700
And talking about rape

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.700
And grilling you about your marriage

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:47.700
He came to the set

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.700
And was like off book

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.700
For his prospector character

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.700
And was so like

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.700
Determined to do a good professional

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.700
Job as an actor

01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:59.700
It was awesome

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.700
He was like

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.700
Again didn't have to

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.700
He doesn't have to give a shit

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.700
He could have like rolled in there in a diaper

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.700
And been like

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.700
Someone get the shit out of this

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:13.700
And give me a lemonade

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.700
And then a teleprompter

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.700
Cause I'm not gonna learn anything

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:19.700
I make TV I'm not gonna learn your TV

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.700
But he came in

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:23.700
And just as a cowboy

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.700
And was like where do I stand

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.700
Alright let me

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.700
Let me get in his own

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:31.700
Howdy partners

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.700
And he's fucking nailed it

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.700
He had been working on it all night

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.700
He knew how to twirl a gun

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.700
But the showrunner who nailed it

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.700
Of course was Mitch Hurwitz

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.700
Yeah he's amazing

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.700
We gotta have him back on here

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.700
Alright

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.700
We should bring out

01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:55.700
DeMorge Brown

01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:59.700
If he's here

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:01.700
I saw him here

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.700
This is Mike Schneider

01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:07.700
From TV Guide Magazine

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.700
He's the chief content officer

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.700
C.C.O. Yo

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.700
Yo

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.700
You wanna weigh in

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:19.700
On the state of television?

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:23.700
No

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.700
I don't know what else there's to say

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.700
It's changing

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.700
And I think that

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.700
The audience is

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:35.700
Sort of dictating the format right now

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.700
It's still finding its place

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.700
It's still grounding itself

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:41.700
But that's venue related

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:43.700
And the stories are everybody's

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.700
Sort of heightening stakes

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.700
And the audience is responding to

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.700
What it wants and everybody else is trying to keep up

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:51.700
Speaking of which

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:53.700
One more thing about TV

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.700
That's an important breaking topic

01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:57.700
Algorithmic versus

01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.700
Development

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:01.700
There's this new thing

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.700
Netflix was assembled by

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:05.700
Someone looking at a chart

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.700
Of Kevin Spacey fans

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.700
Also like political thrillers

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.700
And also like what's her name

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.700
When they assemble the show

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.700
Based on an algorithm

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:17.700
They skipped that whole thing

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.700
Of the writer comes up with an idea

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:21.700
And then the suit helps them

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:23.700
Because whatever

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.700
Ostensibly suits no more than

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.700
Writers about making TV

01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.700
Which is the dumbest idea

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:31.700
It doesn't make any sense

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.700
I see people having different opinions

01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.700
Because it does sound a little Orwellian

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.700
Yahoo knew

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.700
I think I've told the story

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:41.700
Of what community was worth

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.700
I doubt they turned a profit on community

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:45.700
Because

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.700
They probably paid a lot of money for it

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:49.700
How would you make that back

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:51.700
I don't think their intention

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.700
Was to turn a huge profit

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.700
I think their intention was to draw big numbers

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.700
And they knew that those numbers would be big

01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:59.700
Because they already knew

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.700
Where they revealed that they already knew

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:03.700
Have they shown you any numbers?

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:05.700
Before the show aired

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:07.700
Everything is going according to

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:09.700
Their fucking weird

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:11.700
Goldbloom and Jurassic Park

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.700
They graft out

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.700
A bell curve

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.700
Of unique impressions

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.700
Potential and blah blah blah

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.700
It's just going according to plan

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.700
They're like NASA technicians

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.700
They were never worried about it

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:27.700
I'm sitting there going

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:29.700
This cave man

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.700
Silicon Valley people

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:33.700
They can melt things with their eyes

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:37.700
They get shit done for a living

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.700
You contrast that with these

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:41.700
Orange people

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.700
Development people that are like

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:45.700
So

01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.700
I don't think a female lead is going to work

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.700
Why don't you think

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.700
Who are you? Where did you go to school?

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:53.700
What seminar did you attend?

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:55.700
Who are you? My name is

01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.700
Michael Jacobson

01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.700
You just burnt the bridge

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:01.700
You're not going to be able to build back, see

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.700
I'm Mr. Hollywood

01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.700
I make television

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.700
I'm Michael Jacobson

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:11.700
I hope there's no one named Mike Jacobson

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.700
You're going to hear from all of them

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:15.700
I'm bright orange

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:17.700
I'm an orange person

01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:23.700
I have three posters on the wall behind me

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:25.700
One is for a show I worked on

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:27.700
Which is a piece of shit

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:29.700
One is for a classic TV that I didn't work on

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:31.700
The other is for some fucking

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.700
French thing with a French title

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:35.700
It's like I'm smart

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.700
And I've never seen it

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.700
I'm orange!

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.700
I feel badly for shows like Homicide Life on the streets

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.700
That sort of had to run this gauntlet

01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:45.700
Of anonymity

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.700
And also being praised

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.700
Because they were forced into that network

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.700
Yeah, and there were a lot of those shows

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.700
That would have lasted a lot longer if they'd been on now

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.700
Because they have that rabid fan base

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.700
But it just was the wrong time

01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:59.700
It would have been popular and would have been seen more probably

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:01.700
I talked to people about that show

01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:03.700
And it blows my mind

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.700
I mean I love the wire

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.700
It was ahead of its time

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.700
So it would have lasted like 10 years now

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.700
If it was on today

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.700
And who knows, they're bringing back everything

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.700
So maybe one day they'll bring that back

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.700
So right after an all new Fuller House

01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:21.700
I can't believe full

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.700
The Full House thing was happening

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:25.700
It was announced that they were going to do Full House

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.700
And then a couple weeks later

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:29.700
The new headline was Dave Couillier

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.700
Going on to do Full House

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.700
I'm like, dude, you close that deal

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.700
First

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.700
I'm no Full House fan

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.700
But you don't do it without the Cools

01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:45.700
What are you going to have?

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:47.700
Zach Efron doing bullwinkle impressions

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.700
For the 32 year old girls

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:53.700
He tucks them in

01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:55.700
The Cools contract writer was

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.700
Just unattainable at first

01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:59.700
They were all pretty much on

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.700
It was funny just a couple days ago

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:03.700
They said that Saget was on board

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:05.700
But he's been on board from the beginning

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.700
I should know that more than anybody

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:09.700
We're always taping our third episode

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.700
When Allison Breeze contract closes

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.700
It's always like

01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:15.700
Are we going to be able to air this?

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.700
Different people need

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:19.700
Different amounts of time to scare me

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:25.700
Will you stay and play Shadowrun?

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.700
No, it's probably your favorite part of the podcast

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.700
Should I?

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:33.700
I would like you to

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.700
I like it when our guests do it

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.700
Curtis was a newcomer

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.700
I was once new

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:41.700
You like playing Shadowrun

01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:43.700
Now I'm so experienced

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.700
I'm almost cynical about the whole thing

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.700
You're going to phone it in tonight?

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.700
Yeah, probably

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:55.700
Is that as a kid?

01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:57.700
Oh, a long time ago

01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.700
You got your character sheet

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.700
It's got a bunch of nonsense on it

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.700
Sorry, Spencer

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.700
It's like

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:07.700
We're all drunk

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.700
I'm going to mess this up horribly

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.700
Yeah, yeah

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.700
But primarily it's just improvised storytelling

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:15.700
And a turn-based format

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.700
With Spencer is the only one

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.700
Can actually say what happens

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.700
But the rest of us

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.700
Shadowrun can say what we want

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.700
To try to do

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.700
It's probably a pretty good explanation

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.700
So

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.700
Do we

01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:35.700
We got a doctor

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:37.700
You're playing the doctor, right?

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.700
I guess I am, but you went on to another story

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:41.700
I don't know if Dr. Friend is still in the story

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.700
Oh, he's there

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.700
He was instrumental

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:47.700
You don't cut Cowboy out of Midnight Cowboy

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.700
And

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.700
Morges, of course

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.700
And

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:55.700
I wonder if we should just have

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:57.700
Schneider play Mercy O'Donnell

01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.700
Or

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:01.700
I know, I had a little

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:03.700
I had a discussion, because Erin

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:05.700
Texted me during the show sometimes

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.700
When she's not doing it, she's going to watch it live

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.700
And

01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.700
I don't know, she's like

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:15.700
You always have a girl come up to play

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:17.700
Mercy, and then we got in one of those conversations

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:19.700
Every point of view is like

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.700
Yeah, but

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.700
We don't have a lot of

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.700
Women up here, and then it's like

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.700
It's not because only a woman can play the character

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.700
It's just because they make up half the

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.700
Planet, and then we don't

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.700
Have any up here, and then there's a character

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.700
That's a lady

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.700
God, it's hard to be a white knight these days

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.700
That's what I've learned

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.700
That's the phrase for what I do

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.700
I'm always white knighting, that's my thing

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:49.700
White knighting, man

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:51.700
But it's not the

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.700
Doing it to get laid thing

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.700
I'm just doing it to try

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:57.700
To trick people into liking me

01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:59.700
Like, give these women a break, man, I'm a big hero

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.700
I think that's usually

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:03.700
Why people do it, I don't think the

01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.700
You know, those gallant nerds are trying to get laid

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.700
They're just trying to do what they think

01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.700
I mean, make people like them

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.700
If we're going to eliminate that

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:13.700
As a

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.700
If trying to make people like you

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:17.700
Isn't a good reason to

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.700
Not be racist or sexist or anything

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:21.700
I might have to just give up

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:23.700
I don't know what else

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:25.700
Is in it for me anymore

01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.700
I'm just going to roll over and die

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:29.700
Yay!

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:31.700
I heard your brains

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.700
Weird young hologram brains

01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:39.700
Hurry up and die, old man

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:43.700
They could have our future world

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:47.700
Get out of our way, fatty

01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:51.700
Old fat man

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.700
With your dumb

01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:55.700
70s

01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.700
Concepts

01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.700
Wait, I said dumb 70s in pause

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:09.700
The glasses

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:15.700
First of all, like I was searching

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.700
For the word glasses

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:19.700
While touching them

01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:21.700
What do you call these on my face?

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.700
Second of all, come on

01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:27.700
It's supposed to be safe here

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.700
Calling myself old and fat

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.700
And you're going

01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:33.700
Don't forget your glasses are dumb

01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:35.700
And you don't shower either

01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:45.700
Alright, so we got a mercy

01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:47.700
We got a night blade, we got a horde guard

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.700
We got a doctor

01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:51.700
Jeff's character

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:53.700
We're fine

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:55.700
Have a girl play Jeff's character

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:57.700
We got Annie

01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:59.700
We got real life Annie

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:01.700
You've had your big moment in the spotlight

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.700
I don't think that's a good enough reason

01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.700
You seem kind of beleaguered by it

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.700
I don't blame you

01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:17.700
People feel like I should be up there

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:25.700
The guys have been talking

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.700
That sounds like a mandate

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.700
We just don't even have enough chairs

01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:33.700
We don't even have enough chairs

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:35.700
This is all behind people

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.700
We're not going to reject Annie and then say yes to Adam

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:39.700
That's not

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.700
That's crazy

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:43.700
I sure was

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:45.700
Alright

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.700
Adam Goldberg

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.700
One of these days

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:51.700
Curtis will be back

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:53.700
Right to the moon

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:55.700
Adam Goldberg told me in the green room

01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:57.700
Which he's not allowed in

01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:59.700
That he wrote a

01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:01.700
He did knock though

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:03.700
Which if you knock on the green room door

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:05.700
Why are you near the green room

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.700
I enjoyed his knock

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:15.700
It was pleasurable to me

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.700
He wrote a quiz

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.700
Which obviously we don't have time to do tonight

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:21.700
I thought he wrote it for the AV club

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:23.700
I'm way

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.700
My assistant is so fired

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.700
What's up

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.700
Is Dustin going to do a music

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:33.700
Or

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:35.700
Am I going to do it off a cappella

01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:37.700
Is that even what you guys are looking for right now

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.700
Annie why don't you come up

01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:41.700
Do you need help

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.700
Anything

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:45.700
Yeah

01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.700
I forgot

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.700
We'll have Annie play

01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:51.700
I can't remember

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.700
Eve Libertine

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.700
Alright thank you Annie

01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:57.700
Real life Annie

01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.700
After that

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:01.700
Enthusiastic

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.700
No

01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:05.700
Conditional love

01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:07.700
Lapid

01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.700
Did you like the finale

01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.700
Like seriously

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.700
The whole scene

01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.700
Like you're like oh pick out this costume

01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:17.700
And I'm like okay sure

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.700
And then it's like there's literally this whole scene

01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:21.700
About what we were talking about

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:23.700
And then with that button

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:25.700
Of Annie saying like a misfiring skirt

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.700
Like it was like

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.700
It was like you were speaking and it was like we were speaking

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.700
Did you

01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:33.700
What did you think about the

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.700
It was like three in the morning

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:37.700
I'd shoot the last scene

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.700
And I'd been up all night and I got

01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:41.700
I wrote the scene and Annie enters the study room

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:43.700
And Jeff is standing there

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.700
And the cursor's been blinking there forever

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.700
And I wrote like four different versions

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.700
I wrote like truly raunchy like

01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:51.700
The joke is how horny they are for each other

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:53.700
Scenes and then I erased it

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.700
And I wrote like

01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.700
Oh why are we still forcing this

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.700
We're not into this and this version

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:01.700
And I just like all erased and the cursor's still blinking

01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:03.700
And then I had Erin on instant message

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.700
And I said what do I do

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.700
What do I do here

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:09.700
And Erin said have you ever seen Drop Dead Fred

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:11.700
And

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:13.700
And I said no I actually haven't seen it

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:15.700
And she was like there's a very sweet kiss

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:17.700
At the end of Drop Dead Fred

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:19.700
She has to kiss Drop Dead Fred goodbye

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:21.700
It's not a sexual kiss

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:23.700
It's not necessarily an unromantic kiss

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:25.700
But it's not

01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.700
It's not

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.700
They're not macking on each other as the kids said

01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:31.700
In 1982

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:33.700
But

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:35.700
It was like a kiss goodbye

01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:37.700
Like it was love

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:39.700
What did you think

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.700
I try not to

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.700
Ship because I believe that the people

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:45.700
Who are making our television for us should be making

01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:47.700
Those decisions and people shouldn't be complaining

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.700
On the internet about it just because they want to see two people kiss

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:51.700
Oh shit

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:53.700
Alright

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:55.700
Thank you

01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:57.700
But that being said

01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.700
Two things

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:01.700
Not only was it a really nice

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:03.700
And not a really done thing

01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:05.700
I also really love that in Jeff's fantasy

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.700
She was wearing the same outfit

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.700
He was still coming back to that

01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:11.700
Yeah well that was

01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.700
Faster to shoot that way

01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:17.700
The truth comes out

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.700
Alright anyways yeah that was weird for me to

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.700
Fish like actually it was

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:25.700
I wanted more to give Erin credit

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.700
For helping me write the

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:29.700
The final scene

01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:31.700
Of the season

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:33.700
With some nice sweet advice

01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:35.700
Cold from a silly movie

01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:37.700
That I hadn't seen

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.700
That's called a muse

01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:41.700
That's what you call

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.700
Yeah

01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:45.700
Because women can't be writers but they can be muses

01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.700
As long as it's not that horrible Sharon Stone movie

01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:57.700
That's an Albert Brooks movie

01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:59.700
They were both in it

01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:01.700
Alright

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:03.700
Alright well I guess

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.700
That's it

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:07.700
What else could I possibly do

01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:09.700
To slow down the show

01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.700
Oh did you notice I'm in costume

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.700
You're wearing the same thing right

01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:15.700
The costume in question sort of

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:17.700
Right but this is it

01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:19.700
You're so impressed

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.700
It's silent it's amazing

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:23.700
Welcome to cosplay

01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:25.700
It's this boring

01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.700
Well yeah when you're cosplaying just a regular person

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:29.700
Right

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:31.700
Hey I spent four hours

01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.700
Sewing this ruffle onto my dress

01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:35.700
Oh no

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.700
Four hours

01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.700
For those of you who aren't watching the video

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.700
If Annie just threw her cane

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:43.700
I'm so mad

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:45.700
In anger because no one applauded her outfit

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.700
Don't do it now now you just be

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:49.700
They weren't gonna do it

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.700
Okay now that's horrible

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.700
That's a toxic

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:55.700
That was terrible

01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.700
That was like that little tiny turd that comes out of my dog

01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.700
When I make him poop

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:01.700
I'm like you can't

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.700
You're great training him

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:05.700
You better pretend to pee if nothing else

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.700
Then you can come back in and eat

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:09.700
And he's like a little drop comes out

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.700
Alright

01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:13.700
Is there a guest

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:15.700
Mike are you having a good time

01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:17.700
Yes although I'm nervous now

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.700
I'm gonna screw this up

01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:21.700
Have you memorized the sheet yet

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.700
I'm gonna take him back in two minutes

01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:27.700
You'll very quickly see

01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.700
That nervousness will give way to

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:31.700
Frustration and boredom

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:33.700
Not induced by your skills

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:35.700
I mean I'd say it is

01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:37.700
But yeah if you get

01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:39.700
Confused just kinda

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.700
Withdraw you don't have to really dig in

01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.700
Deeper and try and understand any of that

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:45.700
Stuff so

01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:47.700
There you go

01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:49.700
And now

01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.700
It's time

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:53.700
For a new episode of

01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:55.700
Shadow Run

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.700
Is there a guest

01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.700
That we have to give credit for

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:05.700
Yeah this one is just a tweet that Jeff Davis sent

01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:07.700
Oh okay

01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:09.700
Guest summarizer Jeff Davis

01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:11.700
Yup

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:13.700
Alright

01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:15.700
Where's the cue

01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:17.700
Here it is

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.700
Alright

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.700
Harmontown Shadow Run recap now

01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:23.700
Eve had an eagle flap tear gas out

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.700
Mercy was composed

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.700
But cried

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:29.700
Nightblade baked a guard's brains

01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.700
Dicks were of average size

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:35.700
That's it

01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:39.700
I baked a brain

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.700
Yeah I mean realistically

01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.700
Someone broke a window

01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:45.700
So that tear gas could leave

01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:47.700
And then you taste someone so hard

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.700
As brain melted

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.700
Alright so we're like in a room

01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:53.700
In this kind of hospital

01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:55.700
You're in the hospital of a brain plus

01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:57.700
Limited you're in the C Beta Ward

01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:59.700
You snuck in there

01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:01.700
Using lies and

01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:03.700
Sutterfuge to try and infiltrate this place

01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:05.700
You're looking for secret stolen data

01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:07.700
Well I don't know if it's stolen

01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:09.700
Secret data

01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:11.700
That you're trying to steal

01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:13.700
For your employer

01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:15.700
Are we all in the same room

01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:17.700
Yeah you're all in the same room

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.700
There's two guards knocked out on the floor

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.700
They're unconscious

01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:23.700
Alright well you guys know what I'm thinking

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.700
It's the old dress as a guard

01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:31.700
You know what

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.700
I just started taking off the guards

01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:35.700
One of the guards pants

01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:37.700
I'm a man of action

01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:39.700
I'm not going to explain myself

01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:43.700
And since we're in a hospital

01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:45.700
And I'm a doctor

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.700
I'm going to stay in my clothes

01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:51.700
And just pretend like I'm a doctor

01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:53.700
In this hospital

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:55.700
Is that okay?

01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:57.700
I'm going to size up my compatriots

01:29:57.700 --> 01:29:59.700
And compare them to the sizes of the

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:01.700
Indisposed guards to see who might

01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:03.700
Fit in their clothes better

01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:05.700
One of the guards

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:07.700
Is

01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:09.700
Human sized

01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:11.700
That's the only guard whose clothes

01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:13.700
Haven't been removed

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.700
Alright

01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:21.700
I'll undress this guard and stick these

01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:23.700
Human sized clothes on

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.700
They feel really good

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:29.700
They absolutely do

01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:31.700
Pleather

01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.700
Well

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:37.700
Since horticard

01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:39.700
Since you kind of have the psychic abilities

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.700
But I'm also rather minute

01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:43.700
So perhaps the clothes would not fit on me

01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:45.700
That's quite true

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:47.700
Think they'd fit me

01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:49.700
Yeah, yeah I'd say

01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:51.700
You're pretty average

01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:53.700
I'll get dressed up as the other guard

01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:55.700
That happens

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:57.700
Two suits of guard clothes

01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:59.700
Alright

01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:01.700
Well

01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:03.700
Now we need to play in

01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:05.700
Wait a minute

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:07.700
Do I not have clothes on?

01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:09.700
You have normal people

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.700
Clothes on

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.700
So you don't need more guards

01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:15.700
Well there aren't any more guards

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:17.700
That could be an avenue to explore

01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:19.700
Yeah maybe we should go find some more

01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:21.700
And

01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:23.700
I was wondering if I could use spell casting

01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:25.700
To create a uniform for myself

01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:27.700
Sorry

01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:29.700
Why don't you

01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.700
Psychically scope out the

01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:33.700
Outside area

01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:35.700
See if we're going to get a lay on the land

01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.700
So I'm going to use a short of

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:39.700
One of these

01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:43.700
Sort of mental

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:45.700
Mental waves, mental planning

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.700
Sort of active softs

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.700
To scope and see if there are any guards

01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:51.700
In the vicinity

01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:53.700
You got that was like a detect

01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:55.700
Detect humans

01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:57.700
Kind of spell

01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:59.700
Provided the guards are human

01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:01.700
Yeah

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:03.700
Well you do that

01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:05.700
You detect not any guards

01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:07.700
Anywhere nearby or in the outside hall

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:09.700
Except for the one that you

01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:11.700
Well you can't detect it because it's dead

01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:13.700
But you detect humans

01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:15.700
Not in this hall but in the next hall

01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.700
Over there's all sorts of them

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:19.700
With weaker auras

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.700
Some of them are sick and damaged

01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:23.700
Have cyberwares

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:25.700
And certain ailments that are causing

01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:27.700
Their spirits to look differently

01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:29.700
Colored the normal to your senses

01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.700
This would suggest to me that they are

01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:33.700
Perhaps patients

01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:35.700
Subjects

01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:37.700
That the chips might also

01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:39.700
Be in this room, is this possible

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:41.700
That they're being tested on them

01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:43.700
You don't know

01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:45.700
Anything about that

01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:47.700
I have like a meta question

01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:49.700
Yes

01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:51.700
Like do I not remember

01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:53.700
You saying

01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:55.700
Didn't we scope this place out

01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.700
And there's like some computer room

01:32:57.700 --> 01:32:59.700
There's a security room

01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:01.700
In the top floor of the building

01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:03.700
That someone found

01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.700
I don't know who it was

01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:07.700
That's gotta be where the butterfly would be

01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:09.700
Well it would be with securities

01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:11.700
Let's rate the butterfly

01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:13.700
I mean

01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:15.700
Look, jeez

01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:17.700
I'm not really a thinking man

01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:19.700
It's not that the guy playing me is stupid

01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:21.700
It's

01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:23.700
The guy playing me is like

01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.700
The Dustin Hoffman of role playing

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:27.700
The character of me

01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:29.700
I'm just an idiot

01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:31.700
A little drunk

01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:33.700
I deserve accolades

01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:35.700
Not

01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:37.700
For anyone to think I'm a bad, bad player

01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:43.700
I guess I'm kind of at a loss

01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:45.700
I think we just gotta find

01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:47.700
Like records room

01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:49.700
I guess I would start up with that security area

01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:51.700
Does the maps off

01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.700
Is it detailed enough to have a map inside the building

01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:55.700
No, you don't have any maps of this building

01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:57.700
Quite

01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:59.700
May I use my vision zoom

01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:01.700
To look through

01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:03.700
The building to find

01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:05.700
The

01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.700
Security room

01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:09.700
The vision zoom is like a magnifying

01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:11.700
Kind of thing

01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:13.700
It can't see through stuff, but like you could see

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:15.700
60 feet away

01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:17.700
So if I leave

01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:19.700
Looking for it

01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:21.700
I'll use my vision zoom

01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:23.700
And I'll be in the hallway

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:25.700
And I can see it

01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:27.700
Right at the end of the hallway

01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:29.700
If it is there

01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:31.700
Yes

01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:33.700
Well, I mean

01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:35.700
Let me look

01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:37.700
You head out into the hallway using your vision zoom

01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:39.700
And you only see

01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:41.700
A hallway leading to the

01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:43.700
I can't see

01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:45.700
No good

01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:47.700
The B Beta Ward

01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:49.700
What about, can I use perception

01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:51.700
To

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.700
Find out where we're supposed to go

01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:55.700
Yeah, you look around

01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.700
And you locate a small plaque

01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:59.700
That has a virtual

01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:01.700
Readout of the map of the place

01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:03.700
And you can see all the

01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:05.700
Offices with listings for all the

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.700
Employees and there's an office

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.700
That still lists Baldwin Brown

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.700
Ah

01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:13.700
Now we're getting somewhere

01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:15.700
I would suggest we use my

01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:17.700
Sneaking 4 plus 2

01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:19.700
To sneak there

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:21.700
To sneak there, it's going to be quite

01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:23.700
Some ways you trace your way through the map

01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:25.700
And you're going to at least have to go down some

01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:27.700
Stairs that are located by the

01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:29.700
Central cafeteria area

01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:31.700
I can't do stairs

01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:33.700
Metta

01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.700
There's a

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.700
Me and Mercy will go

01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.700
With you

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.700
If she's with guards, you know

01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:43.700
She should be safer

01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:45.700
She won't look like an interloper

01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:47.700
You guys are on your own

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:49.700
I'm a bad leader

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:51.700
Could we

01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:53.700
Perhaps leave the doctor

01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:55.700
With the

01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:57.700
Guards who have been redressed

01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:59.700
Is that possible

01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:01.700
To keep an eye on them, should they wake

01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.700
And possibly

01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:05.700
I would like to follow them

01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:07.700
With you, with the guards

01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:09.700
Leave me with the guards

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:11.700
Okay

01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:13.700
That's

01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:15.700
Kind of a shit duty

01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.700
It's what I usually do

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:19.700
I wind up waiting

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:21.700
In the car, but at least I'm in the room

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:23.700
This time

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:25.700
Why don't we

01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:27.700
Make sure they don't wake up for a long time

01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:29.700
I stun them both again

01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:31.700
Their bodies twitch

01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:33.700
I don't want anyone to feel

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.700
Left out

01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:37.700
This is the shadow run

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:39.700
Maybe what we could do

01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:41.700
Is we could put you

01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:43.700
In a wheelchair

01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:45.700
I'm the doctor

01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:47.700
And we could be walking down

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.700
Like I've got my

01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:51.700
I've got my file

01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.700
Here and we're on our way to a

01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:55.700
You know, to have her look at

01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:57.700
Okay

01:36:57.700 --> 01:36:59.700
We'll just kind of escort you

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.700
Everybody's together

01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:03.700
Watch the guards

01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:05.700
That's what I'll do

01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:07.700
Well, otherwise I'd be the only one

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:09.700
Looking like a weirdo

01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:11.700
You come with too

01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.700
We've got two guards, a doctor, a patient

01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:15.700
It's not like anyone's going to go

01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:17.700
But who's that guy?

01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:19.700
It looks like I can forge some documents

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.700
Do you need those medical records forged?

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:23.700
Yes

01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:25.700
Just trying to help

01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:27.700
No, I had

01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:29.700
Did I sound sarcastic?

01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:31.700
I got really excited about you forging documents

01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:33.700
I got really excited too

01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.700
Let's do it

01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.700
Let's do a montage of him forging documents

01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:41.700
Is there a music cue?

01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:43.700
Nope, there's no music guy

01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:45.700
Dustin's getting high

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:47.700
He's like

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:49.700
No, there's none

01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:55.700
And then documents

01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:57.700
Alright

01:37:57.700 --> 01:37:59.700
Let's get some out

01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:01.700
They're really convincing looking to your eyes

01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:03.700
I wish I could whistle

01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:05.700
So I could do that

01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:07.700
These are some smart looking docs

01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:13.700
You know it

01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:15.700
It's what I do

01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:21.700
Everybody take a document

01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:25.700
Even the doctor

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:27.700
Let's go

01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:29.700
Head for the Baldwin's office

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:31.700
Alright

01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:33.700
You do that

01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:35.700
You charge out into the hallway and down

01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:37.700
Down the hallway and through a door

01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:39.700
As you open the door

01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:41.700
You hear the sounds behind you

01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:43.700
Of five or six guards shuffling into the hallway

01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:45.700
They're just kind of looking around

01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:47.700
But they don't seem bothered by your

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.700
Official looking presence

01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:53.700
You cross out of the hallway

01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:55.700
And into the cafeteria area

01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:57.700
You see all sorts of delicious

01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:59.700
Salads

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:01.700
Real salads

01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:03.700
Not the fake shit

01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:05.700
But

01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:07.700
You're only distracted momentarily

01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.700
You get to the elevator

01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:11.700
Which is next to the stairwell that I mentioned earlier

01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:15.700
I press a button

01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:17.700
Which one?

01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:23.700
One of you guys want to help me pick a button?

01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:25.700
Which floor was Baldwin on?

01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:27.700
Down

01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:29.700
Down

01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:31.700
Did you say that?

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.700
Did you say down?

01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:35.700
You want to press it?

01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:37.700
You press it

01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:41.700
Alright the elevator arrives

01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:43.700
Alright

01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:47.700
This is so amazing

01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:49.700
We're fucking nailing this

01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:51.700
I've been on a lot of Shadow Runs

01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:53.700
And I was like

01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:55.700
This is fucking butter

01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:57.700
It's a nice quiet moment

01:39:57.700 --> 01:39:59.700
In the elevator together

01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.700
Let's get to know each other

01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:03.700
Where'd you learn to forge documents like that?

01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:07.700
Use of practice

01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:09.700
You're looking really sharp in that

01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:11.700
Oh thanks

01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:13.700
I used to work in law enforcement

01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:15.700
It's part of my dark past

01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:17.700
How you doing doc?

01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:19.700
I'm good

01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:21.700
Is this stirring your annoyance

01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:23.700
To be back in a medical establishment?

01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:25.700
I'm back where I need to be

01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:27.700
Why'd you fall from grace?

01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:33.700
I'm sorry

01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:35.700
It's nothing I want to talk about

01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.700
Talk about right now

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:39.700
If I summon some butterflies

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:41.700
Would we all shut up?

01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:43.700
The fuck?

01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:45.700
I was just making a joke

01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:47.700
I'm sorry

01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:49.700
I'm not Jeff

01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:51.700
In case you didn't notice

01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:55.700
Awkward

01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:57.700
The door opens

01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:59.700
Into a large reception like area

01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:01.700
With no windows

01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:03.700
It seems like you may be underground

01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:05.700
Or something

01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:07.700
So there's a nice receptionist

01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:09.700
Seated at a desk

01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:11.700
Her brown hair

01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:13.700
Sharp

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:15.700
Stylish

01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:17.700
Future style

01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:19.700
It looks crazy but normal for you guys

01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:25.700
She looks up at you expectantly

01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:27.700
She doesn't say anything though

01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.700
Hey Mercy

01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:31.700
You're usually the tricky talker

01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:33.700
You'll see by these documents

01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:35.700
There you go

01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:37.700
She looks at the documents

01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:39.700
And inspects them thoroughly

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:41.700
She's like this is great

01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:43.700
I was just saying that

01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:45.700
In the elevator

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.700
This guy's amazing

01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:49.700
But she glances over

01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:51.700
At horticard

01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:53.700
And it's like that guy

01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:55.700
Who's he?

01:41:57.700 --> 01:41:59.700
Very comely

01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:01.700
Very stoically

01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:03.700
My identification

01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:05.700
That says Frank Douglas security guard

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:07.700
And provide this to her

01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:09.700
I work

01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:11.700
Mostly on the ground floor

01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:13.700
Looking for troublesome people

01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:15.700
Hence the armor

01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:19.700
Okay

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:21.700
Here you do this

01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:23.700
You do this here

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:25.700
This is correct

01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:27.700
Hey Mercy

01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:29.700
Use your patented

01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:31.700
Convincing skills

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:33.700
And spin a little something

01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:35.700
Alright

01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:37.700
We're supposed to be here

01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:39.700
So shut up

01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:45.700
Yeah

01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:47.700
We're just going to keep going

01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:49.700
So thanks

01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:51.700
Okay

01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:59.700
You push pastor

01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:01.700
Lady what's the problem

01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:03.700
I mean we got two security guards

01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:05.700
Who is this guy? He says he works here

01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:07.700
He gives me an ID that shows

01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:09.700
He works at the different location

01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:11.700
He's a fancy fucking security consultant

01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:13.700
You're talking your way into a god damn

01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:15.700
Like a

01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:17.700
Burnt bridge to nowhere

01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.700
Aren't you a temp?

01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:21.700
I'm Dr. Friend

01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:23.700
And this is my patient

01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:25.700
And

01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:27.700
He's in serious condition

01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:29.700
And needs help

01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:31.700
And we need to get to Dr. Brown's office

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:33.700
You're going to let us go

01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:35.700
And that's the end of it

01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:37.700
Oh alright

01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:41.700
You're the doctor

01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:43.700
Thank you

01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.700
She lets you go through

01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:51.700
The door into the next room

01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:53.700
Alright I hope that works

01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:57.700
I mean I can't

01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:59.700
I don't read people that well

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.700
Where's

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:03.700
Where's Brown

01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:05.700
You're in a large circular

01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:07.700
Room it's completely

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:09.700
Circular there's a central

01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:11.700
Kind of

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:13.700
Also circular area

01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:15.700
Looks like it's maybe some sort of shaft

01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:17.700
Or who knows what

01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.700
But doors are on the outside of this

01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:21.700
Room kind of radiating off

01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:23.700
Like spokes all over the place

01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:25.700
You smell formaldehyde

01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:27.700
And other unsavory smells

01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:29.700
All over the place

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.700
It's heavy in the air down here

01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:33.700
Must not get too much ventilation

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:35.700
Down here or something

01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:37.700
It's making it smell shitty

01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:39.700
See six doors

01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:41.700
Excluding the one you came through

01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:43.700
To the waiting area

01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:45.700
Alright

01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:47.700
Let's look for Baldwin Brown's door

01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:49.700
There's one that says

01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:51.700
207

01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:53.700
That's the number of Baldwin Brown's office

01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:55.700
You guys

01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:05.700
For those just listening

01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:07.700
Annie's pain

01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:09.700
This is like a low budget

01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:11.700
Mic drop

01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:17.700
I'll stay in guard

01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:19.700
In case that receptionist stuff

01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:21.700
Didn't really work

01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:23.700
I'll just zapper

01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:27.700
Anybody comes through here

01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:29.700
They won't get much further

01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:31.700
I'll tell you that for nothing

01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:33.700
But just as you're saying that

01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.700
You're chirping

01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:37.700
Of your comlink

01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:39.700
Making some noise as if you're receiving

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:41.700
Some sort of call

01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:43.700
From an encrypted line

01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.700
Hello

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.700
Hey

01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:49.700
Remember me

01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:51.700
No

01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:55.700
It's Baldwin

01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:57.700
Baldwin Brown

01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:59.700
You got me my latest job

01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:01.700
Yeah

01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:03.700
Wait what

01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:05.700
You delivered me to a new employer

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:07.700
Yeah

01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:09.700
Did they kill you?

01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:11.700
No I'm still alive

01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:13.700
That's great

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:15.700
It's better than not being that

01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:17.700
You're right

01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:19.700
Anyway

01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:21.700
It has come to my attention

01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:23.700
That you're going after some of my research

01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:25.700
It seems my employer has hired you

01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:27.700
To steal that research

01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:29.700
From me for their benefit

01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:31.700
What?

01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:37.700
If you say so

01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:39.700
I mean I'm not looking to

01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:41.700
Start anything here

01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:43.700
I'm just saying you know

01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.700
I really don't want them to have it

01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:47.700
They didn't earn it

01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:49.700
It's dangerous if they have it

01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:51.700
The world's gonna end

01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:53.700
All sorts of shit

01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:55.700
Please don't deliver it to them

01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:57.700
Listen Baldwin

01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:59.700
Discuss why we shouldn't

01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:01.700
Do our jobs

01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:03.700
When you're doing your job

01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:05.700
And everyone in the world does their job

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:07.700
Maybe we could make up a new job

01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:09.700
Where you pay us to not do our jobs

01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:11.700
That's also

01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:13.700
There's a vast American tradition in that

01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:15.700
It's called subsidy

01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:17.700
You know

01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:19.700
I had an uncle who had a friend

01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:21.700
He literally

01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:23.700
His job was to not grow corn

01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:25.700
Of course

01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:27.700
These were the old days

01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:29.700
Before the pocket clips

01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:33.700
When there was corn

01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:37.700
Now you see a salad

01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:39.700
You fucking freak out

01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:41.700
Back then there was corn everywhere

01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:43.700
So anyways

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:45.700
Without

01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:47.700
Freaking out

01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:49.700
We're really close to our objective

01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:51.700
We're gonna follow through on it

01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:53.700
Cause dumb to get this far

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:55.700
I'm under tight surveillance

01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:57.700
I mean I'm not

01:47:57.700 --> 01:47:59.700
I'm not under

01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:01.700
I'm not allowed to leave the building

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:03.700
I can't escape physically

01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:05.700
So I'm kinda stuck here

01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:07.700
Well you got phone privileges

01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:09.700
So why don't you call us

01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:11.700
In 10 minutes

01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:17.700
Anyway I'm sending one of my

01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:19.700
Associates to your location

01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:21.700
Maybe we can make a drop

01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:23.700
If you're willing

01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:25.700
Ask him what it's worth

01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:27.700
Tell him he's breaking up

01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:29.700
I can break it

01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:31.700
It doesn't work

01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:33.700
It's been 30 years since that's been

01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:35.700
A valid excuse

01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:41.700
Well hold on

01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:43.700
I'm gonna put you on the phone with

01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:45.700
Mercy

01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:47.700
I'm just a hood

01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:49.700
I'm just like a muscle

01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.700
I'm gonna put you on the phone with

01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:53.700
Mercy

01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:55.700
She's like the diplomat

01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:57.700
And the talker

01:48:57.700 --> 01:48:59.700
Hello

01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:01.700
It's Baldwin

01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:03.700
Baldwin who

01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:07.700
Baldwin Brown

01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:09.700
Remember me

01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:15.700
Baldwin Brown

01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:17.700
No

01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:19.700
Well that's okay

01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:21.700
You don't need to know who I am

01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:23.700
I don't think

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:25.700
You're allowed to just say you found him

01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:27.700
I heard

01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:29.700
It's nice sneaking and we find them

01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:31.700
Well no

01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:33.700
There's this door

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:35.700
It's got all sorts of crazy locks

01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:37.700
It looks like it has some sort of biometric scanner on it

01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:39.700
That needs some sort of important

01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:41.700
Authorized data to let someone through

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.700
Shit

01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:45.700
I look on my person for like

01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:47.700
Doesn't Mercy have some sort of access

01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:49.700
To these sorts of things?

01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:51.700
We're security guard closed

01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:53.700
Don't we have something on us that's like a

01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:55.700
You know like a card?

01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:57.700
It doesn't seem to be reacting to the thing

01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:59.700
It seems like

01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:01.700
If I use these smart linked

01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:03.700
Sunglasses

01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:05.700
Is there a way to tap into the system

01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:07.700
Maybe backdoor it and find a code from inside

01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:11.700
Do you have hacking? I don't think you do

01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:13.700
I have lock picking that won't work

01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:15.700
Nope

01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.700
I have computer, software, hardware

01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:19.700
I mean very low

01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:21.700
Ratings

01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:23.700
What was the first one?

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:25.700
Arcana

01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:27.700
We're in a shadow run and no one knows how to

01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:29.700
Fucking do computer shit

01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:31.700
It's like the fucking

01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:33.700
Point

01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:35.700
You hear a voice over

01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:37.700
Your comlinks being all like

01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:39.700
Hey guys

01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:41.700
Did you say you needed hacking

01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:43.700
Yeah where's that guy god damn it

01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:47.700
Hack guy

01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:49.700
You didn't invite me into the uber

01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:51.700
God damn it

01:50:57.700 --> 01:50:59.700
Like word hack is in his name

01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:01.700
Left him

01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:03.700
We're the worst shadow runners ever

01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:05.700
Can I send an uber for him?

01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:07.700
Yeah I mean

01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:09.700
I do this remote I've been watching you guys

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:11.700
You set off like 5

01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:13.700
Vibration sensors

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:15.700
You broke a window that's like where they're set

01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:19.700
Anyway

01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:21.700
Let me work on this door it'll take

01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:23.700
A couple minutes

01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:25.700
Alright keep talking to Baldwin that was good

01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:27.700
Baldwin you still there?

01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:29.700
Oh yeah you just stopped talking for like

01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:31.700
30 seconds

01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:33.700
Sorry about that

01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:35.700
So where are you calling

01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:37.700
From again?

01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:39.700
From my office

01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:41.700
They don't let me leave you put me here

01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:43.700
I don't I mean

01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:45.700
This doesn't seem like the important part of why I called

01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:47.700
It's important this research

01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:49.700
That's my life's work

01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:51.700
They didn't earn it they're trying to

01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:53.700
Trying to turn it

01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:55.700
To make monies and I'm trying to help people

01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:57.700
Do you get it

01:51:57.700 --> 01:51:59.700
I don't I don't have money

01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:01.700
They don't even pay me like

01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:03.700
I don't even think that's legal by their standards

01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:05.700
But they don't I mean

01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:07.700
I could owe you guys

01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:09.700
But I don't have the monies

01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:11.700
Ask him what these things do like what's the big deal

01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:13.700
What do these things do

01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:15.700
And what's the big deal

01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:17.700
It's research

01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:19.700
I mean you guys wouldn't understand it

01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:21.700
It has to do with reversing the effects of

01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:23.700
BTL chip brain degradation

01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:25.700
I've tapped in on my

01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:27.700
Comlink and I'm listening in

01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:29.700
Can I apply my

01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:31.700
Analyze Truth to sign out

01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:33.700
Some sense of

01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:35.700
Truth to his being

01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:37.700
Unfortunately it doesn't work over electronic communication

01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:39.700
Yeah I thought I'd try

01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:41.700
It's worth it

01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:43.700
What if we paid you

01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:45.700
Yeah I mean sure

01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:47.700
Now you're on our payroll

01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:49.700
I could be

01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:51.700
Do you guys have payroll

01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:55.700
We have some cool

01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:57.700
Guards outfits

01:52:57.700 --> 01:52:59.700
Also

01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:01.700
You'd have to access a digital W9

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.700
For yourself

01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:07.700
Well that sounds fine

01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:09.700
Heck I don't rush or anything

01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:11.700
We don't want you to do a less than perfect job

01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:13.700
So take your time on the door

01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:15.700
Hey man it's done it's been done

01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:17.700
Oh Jesus Christ

01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:19.700
Alright I open the door

01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:21.700
You open the door

01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:23.700
You see an antique style

01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:25.700
Office it's got old

01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:27.700
What do you call it

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:29.700
Unfinishing

01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:31.700
That thing where the finishing is going away

01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:33.700
Old

01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:35.700
An old desk

01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:37.700
Tarnished

01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:39.700
It's a tarnished desk

01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:41.700
You see an old tarnished desk

01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:43.700
With a key lock

01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:45.700
One of these old style throwback keys

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:47.700
Key locks rather

01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:49.700
There's not a key in the lock

01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:51.700
Nothing else is in the office

01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:53.700
It looks like most of the stuff has been

01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:55.700
Moved out recently

01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:57.700
Well you know I'm picking that lock

01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:59.700
Bar picking that lock

01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:01.700
You gonna ask me what my lock picking is

01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:03.700
No it should be like

01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:05.700
I have a crowbar

01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:07.700
I do

01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:09.700
I have a crowbar

01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:11.700
Can I use the crowbar

01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:13.700
I'd really rather use the lock pickets

01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:15.700
Oh so now we get delicate

01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:17.700
It's a little more elegant

01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:19.700
Alright no go ahead

01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:21.700
Is there a danger in leaving it

01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:23.700
You know disarrayed

01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:25.700
No it's just but it's cooler to pick the lock

01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:27.700
If it fails we'll crowbar

01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:29.700
Okay okay go

01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:31.700
I mean I didn't mean to step on your toes in the elevator

01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:33.700
No no it's fine

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:35.700
See I upset you

01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:37.700
No you haven't upset me please pick the lock

01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:47.700
I pick the lock

01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:51.700
Mercy keep it talkin

01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:53.700
You pick the lock

01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:55.700
It's picked

01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:57.700
Okay open it I open it

01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:59.700
You open it and you see

01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:01.700
You see

01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:03.700
Free data chips

01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:07.700
I grab them

01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.700

01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:11.700
They're in your grasp

01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:13.700
You've obtained what might be the secret research

01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:19.700
Well yeah but also we have to do something

01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:21.700
That gives applause

01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:23.700
Perhaps

01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:25.700
I know you think there should be an ending

01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:27.700

The ninjas of a cat

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:53.700

01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:03.700
Snicked

01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:05.700
Wolverine claws pop out of his knuckles
