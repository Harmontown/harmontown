How was your daughter?\n\n03:48.700 --> 04:00.700\nMy daughter is wonderful, and she's actually working the big festival that's going on as we speak called Field Day with lots of bands\n\n04:00.700 --> 04:03.700\nAnd she's doing that, she's done with school, she loves school\n\n04:03.700 --> 04:08.700\nAnd I spent 10 days with her, without break, it was wonderful\n\n04:08.700 --> 04:09.700\nYeah\n\n04:09.700 --> 04:12.700\nI mean, you know, I thought about you from time to time\n\n04:12.700 --> 04:18.700\nBut it was great, thank you for asking\n\n04:18.700 --> 04:21.700\nAlright, awesome, can you guys see okay? You're here, alright, okay\n\n04:21.700 --> 04:23.700\nThere's Seth, the hitchhiker\n\n04:23.700 --> 04:24.700\nHi\n\n04:24.700 --> 04:28.700\nSo it's a little less hitchhiking what you're doing at this point, you're just sort of orbiting the show\n\n04:28.700 --> 04:30.700\nHey, I'm leaving tomorrow\n\n04:30.700 --> 04:32.700\nOkay, alright, well we're not yelling at you\n\n04:33.700 --> 04:38.700\nUsually hitchhikers travel in a line, whereas you've been kind of circling\n\n04:38.700 --> 04:44.700\nBut that's, hey look, that's better than what I'm doing, which is, I'm just, I'm just jerking off\n\n04:46.700 --> 04:48.700\nNot right now\n\n04:48.700 --> 04:51.700\nThat would be amazing if you could do it with no hands\n\n04:53.700 --> 04:58.700\nAlright, so, oh okay, so I just want to, let's talk about our art, this is our art segment\n\n04:58.700 --> 05:09.700\nSo we've got music for the art segment\n\n05:09.700 --> 05:19.700\nSometimes things are to exist at art TV or games\n\n05:19.700 --> 05:25.700\nSo I was, I mean, so I have this ongoing, like, I don't know, what do you call it, like a feud\n\n05:25.700 --> 05:28.700\nOr it's a bee in Aaron's bonnet\n\n05:28.700 --> 05:32.700\nMy lovely wife, Erin McGathy, who's also not here with us, she's spending time with the dogs\n\n05:32.700 --> 05:35.700\nBecause we were away from them all weekend\n\n05:35.700 --> 05:38.700\nAnd Jeff is just sick\n\n05:38.700 --> 05:44.700\nBut so, Erin, like, I don't know, she's an artist, she's more, she's a visual person\n\n05:44.700 --> 05:55.700\nShe sees colors and things, and I always, I always just like, I think colors are dumb, you know, like, I don't, they seem pretty pointless\n\n05:55.700 --> 05:58.700\nI think the point of them originally was that, you know, we're primates\n\n05:58.700 --> 06:01.700\nAnd so we needed to recognize if an apple was going to kill us if we ate it\n\n06:01.700 --> 06:06.700\nBut now we have, we have genetic engineering and, you know, all apples are fine\n\n06:06.700 --> 06:10.700\nThey're injected with preservatives\n\n06:10.700 --> 06:14.700\nYeah, it's like, we've finished it, we've taken God's place\n\n06:14.700 --> 06:20.700\nAnd so why not just lower the bit value of the graphics in the universe\n\n06:20.700 --> 06:24.700\nWe could probably expand our RAM or our CPU\n\n06:24.700 --> 06:29.700\nIf things were just black and white, imagine how much more Earth there could be, possibly\n\n06:29.700 --> 06:34.700\nI know that's not how the universe works, but I'm just saying, like, maybe our brains could process more\n\n06:34.700 --> 06:38.700\nIf we just didn't see color, we're like, how about eight colors?\n\n06:38.700 --> 06:43.700\nBecause that's the only ones we can name, really, and then people say, oh, egg shell instead of white\n\n06:43.700 --> 06:46.700\nAnd it's like, that's white, that's dumb, to me it's dumb\n\n06:46.700 --> 06:52.700\nBut so Erin was always like, she showed me this magazine and she had this kind of smirk on her face\n\n06:52.700 --> 06:56.700\nAnd she shows me this, like, grid thing\n\n06:56.700 --> 07:02.700\nIt's like, it's this thing with like a thousand lines in it, and she's like, how many colors do you see here?\n\n07:02.700 --> 07:06.700\nAnd I'm like, I don't know, like, the usual eight dumb colors\n\n07:06.700 --> 07:12.700\nAnd she's like, you know, I'm a tetra-hakamagaba\n\n07:12.700 --> 07:17.700\nLike, there's some, she's got more cones or rods or something in her eyes\n\n07:17.700 --> 07:21.700\nShe's a tetra-chromat, tetra-chromats?\n\n07:21.700 --> 07:27.700\nWhere are my tetra-chromes at?\n\n07:27.700 --> 07:35.700\nShe's immensely proud of this, which I would equate to being proud of your race, which is bad\n\n07:35.700 --> 07:46.700\nIt seems like a vile quality in a person, like, what is the difference between that and saying, like, you know I have very little melanin in my skin\n\n07:46.700 --> 07:50.700\nI'm like a snowbank\n\n07:50.700 --> 08:00.700\nOh, so you're, okay, great, you're racist, so, but she's like smirking because she can see, like, I don't know, more of them than I can\n\n08:00.700 --> 08:07.700\nShe's enough that you could, but I'm like, wait, how many can you see? She's like 20 or 30 or something, whatever the number is, 38\n\n08:07.700 --> 08:12.700\nAnd as I'm like, well, are you talking about all the different shades of the colors?\n\n08:12.700 --> 08:15.700\nAnd she's like, yeah, well, how many shades do you see?\n\n08:15.700 --> 08:21.700\nAnd I'm like, are we really talking about each individual shade, each striation that you can see on this thing?\n\n08:21.700 --> 08:28.700\nAnd she's like, yeah, and I'm like, well, I mean, that's ridiculous, but one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17\n\n08:28.700 --> 08:31.700\nAnd she's like, shut up, stop it, you're lying\n\n08:31.700 --> 08:38.700\n25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33? 33, I guess, I mean, there's probably a couple more, but I'll lowball it\n\n08:38.700 --> 08:41.700\nAnd she's like, fuck you, you're lying\n\n08:41.700 --> 08:45.700\nAnd I'm like, no, I'm not, colors are dumb\n\n08:45.700 --> 08:52.700\nI got more cones too, I'm a tetracycline\n\n08:52.700 --> 08:57.700\nBut I just throw them away, they just go into my eye and I just go\n\n08:57.700 --> 09:02.700\nBecause they're dumb, you don't need them\n\n09:02.700 --> 09:08.700\nWho needs more colors? You know who had more colors in grade school? The rich kids\n\n09:08.700 --> 09:12.700\nGoing by Crayola metrics, those were rich kids\n\n09:12.700 --> 09:16.700\nThey also had a sharpener built into the front of the box\n\n09:16.700 --> 09:20.700\nLittle, little, little, little, little born rich parasites\n\n09:20.700 --> 09:22.700\nBecause dads didn't hit them\n\n09:22.700 --> 09:28.700\nI had to earn every fucking crayon in my shitty little stepped on box\n\n09:28.700 --> 09:33.700\nBroken chunks of like, just like caveman pigment\n\n09:33.700 --> 09:38.700\nI had to go out and dig up clay and ochre\n\n09:38.700 --> 09:44.700\nAnd like, make red, because my parents are like, there's red out there, go get it in the yard\n\n09:44.700 --> 09:50.700\nThere's red on your pillowcase, yeah, because you guys don't give me enough water\n\n09:50.700 --> 09:55.700\nI got a lot of nosebleeds when I was a kid\n\n09:55.700 --> 09:58.700\nI thought I was an alien abductee, do you believe in alien abduction?\n\n09:58.700 --> 10:02.700\nI do, I do, I do, yeah, I think that's a real possibility\n\n10:02.700 --> 10:04.700\nHuh, yeah\n\n10:06.700 --> 10:08.700\nI'm assuming you don't\n\n10:08.700 --> 10:12.700\nI did when I was a kid, I was like, I think that's a thing that you gravitate to when you're a kid\n\n10:12.700 --> 10:14.700\nBecause it's a real...\n\n10:14.700 --> 10:16.700\nIt explains a lot\n\n10:16.700 --> 10:20.700\nWell, yeah, it helps you cope, I think, you know, the fantasy that you're special\n\n10:20.700 --> 10:23.700\nThe world is hard for you for a reason\n\n10:23.700 --> 10:29.700\nMaybe these people are coming and getting you and then they're like, you know, milking your prostate\n\n10:29.700 --> 10:33.700\nTelling you secrets about the environment\n\n10:33.700 --> 10:35.700\nYou're destroying it\n\n10:35.700 --> 10:43.700\nWe know things that you can only find out from cow anuses and like, go back to your world\n\n10:43.700 --> 10:47.700\nBut we're gonna keep coming back and giving you nosebleeds and you're so special\n\n10:47.700 --> 10:52.700\nI'm still waiting for you to explain why none of this makes sense\n\n10:52.700 --> 10:54.700\nIt still does, I'm not like that\n\n10:54.700 --> 10:57.700\nWhen you grow up, why do you not believe in that anymore?\n\n10:57.700 --> 11:02.700\nI think I started to, well, I started to learn about things like sleep paralysis\n\n11:02.700 --> 11:06.700\nWhich there's this, I don't know if it's a good documentary, Aaron and I just watched it tonight\n\n11:06.700 --> 11:13.700\nThe guys that made the documentary about the shining, Room 237, is that, am I getting that right?\n\n11:13.700 --> 11:17.700\nThat's a really interesting documentary that everybody should watch\n\n11:17.700 --> 11:22.700\nThis one's also very interesting, I hesitate to use the words good documentary because I don't know if it's...\n\n11:22.700 --> 11:27.700\nBecause it's just a bunch of people talking about their sleep paralysis experiences\n\n11:27.700 --> 11:31.700\nIt's very interesting, but maybe that's different from a good documentary\n\n11:31.700 --> 11:34.700\nShut up, Dan, just shut up\n\n11:34.700 --> 11:37.700\nAlright, now start talking\n\n11:37.700 --> 11:39.700\nFirst check to see if everyone likes you\n\n11:46.700 --> 11:48.700\nSarcasm\n\n11:48.700 --> 11:52.700\nI can tell when it's fake, I can always tell when it's fake\n\n11:52.700 --> 11:56.700\nSo, the, god damn it, sleep paralysis, you know what I'm talking about\n\n11:56.700 --> 11:58.700\nSo you go to, have you ever had that?\n\n11:58.700 --> 11:59.700\nNo, I've had it\n\n11:59.700 --> 12:01.700\nOh, it's terrifying, I've had it\n\n12:01.700 --> 12:04.700\nHow many people have had sleep paralysis experiences?\n\n12:04.700 --> 12:05.700\nReally?\n\n12:05.700 --> 12:07.700\nIt's a very common thing\n\n12:07.700 --> 12:13.700\nThe odd thing is, it's very common for it to happen very rarely to everybody\n\n12:13.700 --> 12:18.700\nIt's very uncommon for it to happen all the time to a few people\n\n12:18.700 --> 12:21.700\nWhich is, some people have it every night\n\n12:21.700 --> 12:25.700\nAnd they're living in like a sort of strange hellscape\n\n12:25.700 --> 12:29.700\nWhere they have no choice but to like make friends with the shadow people\n\n12:29.700 --> 12:32.700\nAnd give them names and stuff, I go, that's the one with the hat\n\n12:32.700 --> 12:35.700\nBy the way, hats aren't scary by the way\n\n12:35.700 --> 12:39.700\nThey show like the shadow, because one of the symptoms of sleep paralysis\n\n12:39.700 --> 12:41.700\nOne of the things that happens is the intruder\n\n12:41.700 --> 12:44.700\nThis happened to me, this is a terrifying thing\n\n12:44.700 --> 12:46.700\nSometimes a lot of people talk about things on their chest\n\n12:46.700 --> 12:49.700\nJust in case anybody doesn't know what this is\n\n12:49.700 --> 12:53.700\nI mean, the scientific theory is that when you go into REM sleep\n\n12:53.700 --> 12:56.700\nWhich is when you're going to start dreaming\n\n12:56.700 --> 13:04.700\nThe scientific explanation for this is that your body releases a, or your brain releases a chemical to your body\n\n13:04.700 --> 13:10.700\nOr something that keeps it from moving whenever you'd want to move it\n\n13:10.700 --> 13:13.700\nLike when you're reaching for a big cookie in your dream\n\n13:13.700 --> 13:16.700\nSo you don't gouge your wife's eyes out\n\n13:16.700 --> 13:20.700\nSo it's a natural part of REM sleep\n\n13:20.700 --> 13:25.700\nSupposedly to just, your body is supposed to not move and cannot move chemically\n\n13:25.700 --> 13:30.700\nHowever, you're always supposed to be unconscious and sleeping when that's happening\n\n13:30.700 --> 13:34.700\nAnd sleep paralysis is when either while waking up or going to sleep\n\n13:34.700 --> 13:40.700\nWhen you get to the same, there's an overlap where you are awake and your body is completely paralyzed\n\n13:40.700 --> 13:43.700\nAnd so then your middle brain starts to panic\n\n13:43.700 --> 13:46.700\nAnd then these things, these very common things that happen\n\n13:46.700 --> 13:53.700\nLike people see things on their chest that are like, you know, demonic kind of iconography that happens\n\n13:53.700 --> 13:58.700\nAnd like one of the most common things is just this shadowy figure in the room walking toward you\n\n13:58.700 --> 14:03.700\nAnd it happened, and there's like these archetypes like the shadow, the little shadow man\n\n14:03.700 --> 14:06.700\nAnd the guy with the hat, which is, again, not scary\n\n14:06.700 --> 14:12.700\nIt's like a hat, it looks like a pizza logo, it looks like Rocky Rococo\n\n14:12.700 --> 14:18.700\nAnd then there's an evil hag, which I feel like, because I saw like a cloaked figure\n\n14:18.700 --> 14:22.700\nI was like 20 years old, I was sleeping at my parents house\n\n14:22.700 --> 14:27.700\nProbably laundry or something, doing laundry for the weekend and I was crashing in my old bedroom\n\n14:27.700 --> 14:34.700\nAnd this happened to me and I woke up and I couldn't move and this, I mean, it's so real\n\n14:34.700 --> 14:43.700\nThere was a cloaked black figure in the corner of my bedroom that just strode confidently toward me\n\n14:43.700 --> 14:48.700\nI could hear every footfall on the carpet, it was like, it was really, really there\n\n14:48.700 --> 14:55.700\nIt wasn't a visual hallucination, it was like, I was sensing all of it, the proximity, the sound of its footsteps\n\n14:55.700 --> 15:00.700\nAnd this like image of, I think, a female figure, kind of cloaked and permanently in shadow\n\n15:00.700 --> 15:07.700\nJust marching across the room toward me, which is just, you know, sometimes you see a coat rack in the dark\n\n15:07.700 --> 15:13.700\nAnd you're like, holy shit, oh god, that scared me for a second, but this is a person in the room that is like there\n\n15:13.700 --> 15:16.700\nIt's not like, oh, that looks like something, it's there\n\n15:16.700 --> 15:21.700\nAnd it's just like, marched across the room and just kept coming at me\n\n15:21.700 --> 15:26.700\nAs soon as it, as if it just wanted to do just that, just wanted to put its face in my face\n\n15:26.700 --> 15:31.700\nAnd which is like, that's even scarier, because you're like, why would you want to just scare a person?\n\n15:31.700 --> 15:39.700\nBecause you're crazy, so you, so it's like, and then as soon as the face got close enough to touch my neck\n\n15:39.700 --> 15:44.700\nI finally was able to, because the whole time you're trying to scream and you can't\n\n15:44.700 --> 15:46.700\nAnd then I finally went, mom!\n\n15:46.700 --> 15:48.700\nAnd I was 20\n\n15:48.700 --> 15:53.700\nAnd I like bolted up and then I just sat there and I was like, catching my breath in the adrenaline\n\n15:53.700 --> 15:57.700\nAs I'm realizing this was all, this was not real, but I just shouted out, mom\n\n15:57.700 --> 16:01.700\nAnd then I just kept waiting, and I was, I thought about saying, I'm okay\n\n16:01.700 --> 16:04.700\nBut then I was like, let's see what happens\n\n16:04.700 --> 16:06.700\nNever nothing\n\n16:06.700 --> 16:08.700\nAnd I just went back to sleep\n\n16:08.700 --> 16:09.700\nWow\n\n16:09.700 --> 16:17.700\nAnd I've had a couple of experiences that fit in the same category, but that was the legit textbook sleep paralysis\n\n16:17.700 --> 16:18.700\nIt's never happened to you\n\n16:18.700 --> 16:20.700\nNever, absolutely not\n\n16:20.700 --> 16:22.700\nAnd did it ever happen after that to you?\n\n16:22.700 --> 16:25.700\nYeah, I've had like a couple weird like related kind of things\n\n16:25.700 --> 16:26.700\nBut not like that\n\n16:26.700 --> 16:28.700\nNothing that was really terrifying\n\n16:28.700 --> 16:33.700\nNo, like I've had just generic, I wake up and I can't move my body and I panic\n\n16:33.700 --> 16:36.700\nAnd then I'm suddenly able to move it\n\n16:36.700 --> 16:40.700\nBut like not with the goo guys coming at me\n\n16:40.700 --> 16:50.700\nAnd I've also had like weird like, I would have these things in my mid-20s where like\n\n16:50.700 --> 16:56.700\nIt's like my, it's like all of a sudden I'm sleeping and then I'm awake, but I can't move\n\n16:56.700 --> 17:02.700\nAnd then my whole self, but my body's still in the bed\n\n17:02.700 --> 17:07.700\nMy whole self starts getting thrown around the room, banged up against the walls\n\n17:07.700 --> 17:15.700\nLike somebody's trying to pull my soul out of my apartment\n\n17:15.700 --> 17:20.700\nBut for some reason it can only move it around in the room\n\n17:20.700 --> 17:23.700\nSo it's just banging into every wall and ceiling\n\n17:23.700 --> 17:26.700\nAnd I can kind of see that I'm still in bed\n\n17:26.700 --> 17:32.700\nAnd then finally at a certain point it manages to get out and I shoot up into the sky\n\n17:32.700 --> 17:36.700\nAt like the speed of sound, I'm assuming\n\n17:36.700 --> 17:40.700\nAnd it's like, it's actually kind of cool, I'm like, holy shit I can fly\n\n17:40.700 --> 17:44.700\nThis is going to be amazing, I'm going to be like this new kind of hero\n\n17:44.700 --> 17:48.700\nI can do this at night and I'm assuming I won't be able to get shot or stabbed\n\n17:48.700 --> 17:51.700\nSo I could probably fight crime or at least discourage it\n\n17:51.700 --> 17:56.700\nAnd I'm like, there's just this elated feeling of like, holy shit I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying\n\n17:56.700 --> 18:01.700\nAnd then just gives way as the physics of it like start to kick in where you're like\n\n18:01.700 --> 18:05.700\nI'm not flying, I've been rocketed upward, I can't fly\n\n18:05.700 --> 18:09.700\nI'm just really high up in the sky and you feel the momentum stop\n\n18:09.700 --> 18:11.700\nAnd then you're like, now I'm going to fall\n\n18:11.700 --> 18:13.700\nAnd it's like, what?\n\n18:13.700 --> 18:17.700\nIt just turns into one of those falling nightmares and then you wake up\n\n18:17.700 --> 18:20.700\nSo anyways, and you just\n\n18:20.700 --> 18:23.700\nI would actually have told that one first\n\n18:23.700 --> 18:28.700\nThat's a lot more dramatic than the woman walking towards you\n\n18:28.700 --> 18:31.700\nWell, noted, alright\n\n18:31.700 --> 18:34.700\nThat's good, it's conditional love\n\n18:34.700 --> 18:36.700\nKeep letting me know when I fuck up\n\n18:36.700 --> 18:38.700\nThey were both good stories though\n\n18:43.700 --> 18:47.700\nWhat are your dreams about, like a gumdrop tree? Fuck you\n\n18:50.700 --> 18:53.700\nI had unconditional love\n\n18:53.700 --> 18:59.700\nYou just like a, you dream like we assume dogs do, you're just like chasing a rabbit\n\n18:59.700 --> 19:02.700\nAnd then while you're sleeping you're like\n\n19:03.700 --> 19:05.700\nYour wife's like, oh, he's dreaming\n\n19:05.700 --> 19:07.700\nHe's so cute\n\n19:07.700 --> 19:10.700\nI am cute when I do that\n\n19:11.700 --> 19:16.700\nDo you ever see the YouTube video of the dog that's dreaming and it's doing like, it's like running on its side\n\n19:16.700 --> 19:21.700\nAnd it's like, and then it's like, it's running and then it starts to like\n\n19:21.700 --> 19:24.700\nIt starts to run really fast and then it like looks behind it\n\n19:24.700 --> 19:28.700\nLike it's snarling, like it's clearly being chased by something it doesn't like\n\n19:28.700 --> 19:34.700\nAnd then it kind of, it gets up and runs full speed into a wall right next to it\n\n19:34.700 --> 19:36.700\nAnd then wakes up\n\n19:37.700 --> 19:40.700\nAnd then it just kind of like sits there like, yeah\n\n19:42.700 --> 19:46.700\nI mean, who do you talk to when you're a dog, when that happens to you\n\n19:46.700 --> 19:48.700\nYou got nobody you can go to with that\n\n19:51.700 --> 19:53.700\nAlright, so colors are dumb\n\n19:53.700 --> 20:01.700\nYou know, I'll save that for when Spencer's out here\n\n20:02.700 --> 20:05.700\nAlright, okay, well let's meet a new friend shall we\n\n20:05.700 --> 20:06.700\nSure\n\n20:06.700 --> 20:12.700\nI invited somebody, you know, somebody that I've been interacting with throughout my career from time to time\n\n20:12.700 --> 20:15.700\nYou know, we're not, we don't hang out ever\n\n20:15.700 --> 20:17.700\nI think we're like Commissioner Gortons to each other\n\n20:17.700 --> 20:24.700\nNeither of us is Batman, but we're just using that to illustrate distance and respect\n\n20:29.700 --> 20:33.700\nBig grudging functional vigilante respect\n\n20:33.700 --> 20:35.700\nThe system has failed us both\n\n20:37.700 --> 20:38.700\nAnd there we are\n\n20:39.700 --> 20:46.700\nThe funniest moment in the good Batman movie, the middle Christian Bale one, the Heath Ledger one\n\n20:46.700 --> 20:53.700\nI always laugh when Commissioner Gortons goes into the bank vault and it's like fluorescent lit\n\n20:53.700 --> 20:56.700\nAnd then he's like, oh no, the money's marked or whatever\n\n20:57.700 --> 21:01.700\nAnd then he turns, it's like one of the cops turns and Batman's just hanging out\n\n21:02.700 --> 21:07.700\nIt looks so funny, he's like, I know he does that all the time because he's like a detective\n\n21:07.700 --> 21:10.700\nBut it's just weird that he would be like, hey, I'm here\n\n21:10.700 --> 21:16.700\nLike he had to get into that room and it's like, usually Batman comes in through like little windows and things\n\n21:16.700 --> 21:21.700\nAnd it's usually nighttime and this is like just noon and it's like, there's like fluorescent lights\n\n21:21.700 --> 21:28.700\nAnd it's just funny, it's also funny to cut from someone looking and then just a hard cut to Batman\n\n21:29.700 --> 21:33.700\nHe just looks like, oh he just looks like the biggest nerd in that moment\n\n21:33.700 --> 21:36.700\nThere's no way enough for that to look cool\n\n21:36.700 --> 21:42.700\nIt's like, because we've seen people under fluorescent light dressed as Batman\n\n21:42.700 --> 21:44.700\nAnd we've never gone like, ooh\n\n21:46.700 --> 21:51.700\nWe've always just, at best we'll go like, hey can I get a picture, man? You look really awesome\n\n21:55.700 --> 21:57.700\nIt's a single gunshot from the back\n\n21:57.700 --> 22:09.700\nNo note, but a brief check of his closet at home tells us the whole story\n\n22:11.700 --> 22:13.700\nAlright, yeah, sorry, I was introducing this guy\n\n22:15.700 --> 22:17.700\nApparently this guy needs no introduction\n\n22:20.700 --> 22:23.700\nHe's really what he is, he's the editor of TV Guide Magazine\n\n22:23.700 --> 22:28.700\nBut because the world is changing, one of the cruel tricks of fate is that he has a new title\n\n22:28.700 --> 22:30.700\nWhich is just not as sexy\n\n22:30.700 --> 22:35.700\nHe's still just as important, but he's now called the chief content officer\n\n22:38.700 --> 22:39.700\nPoor guy\n\n22:40.700 --> 22:45.700\nBut he's awesome and he's a sort of, I don't know, he's my TV talking buddy\n\n22:45.700 --> 22:54.700\nIt's Mike Schneider\n\n23:00.700 --> 23:03.700\nI think they like it when you sit there, yeah, that's your mic\n\n23:06.700 --> 23:08.700\nSo we're talking about dreams, right?\n\n23:10.700 --> 23:13.700\nYou guys have these dreams that are so vivid that you wake up the next day\n\n23:13.700 --> 23:16.700\nAnd you're still not quite sure if it was real or not, if it really happened or not\n\n23:16.700 --> 23:22.700\nYeah, like when you're in your early 20s, and I always had those dreams where you'd find a $50\n\n23:22.700 --> 23:28.700\nAnd it's like you really need $50, that's like a lot of ramen noodles and pot and stuff\n\n23:28.700 --> 23:36.700\nAnd you're like, it's like such a low-stakes dream that you're like three hours into your shower\n\n23:36.700 --> 23:38.700\nThree hour shower\n\n23:38.700 --> 23:43.700\nThree hours into your day when you suddenly realize you don't have $50\n\n23:43.700 --> 23:45.700\nIt's so sad\n\n23:45.700 --> 23:46.700\nThe biggest letdown of the day\n\n23:46.700 --> 23:54.700\nSo I had this really weird dream last night, and maybe amateur psychologists dream catcher Dan Harmon can help me with this\n\n23:54.700 --> 23:58.700\nSo in my dream, I'm suddenly a contestant on Jeopardy\n\n23:58.700 --> 24:04.700\nBut for some reason, they've sold like the branding rights to Dunkin' Donuts\n\n24:04.700 --> 24:12.700\nSo there's a new Jeopardy set, literally right behind Trebek is a functioning Dunkin' Donuts branch\n\n24:12.700 --> 24:14.700\nWhere they're actually selling donuts on the set\n\n24:14.700 --> 24:15.700\nDuring the game show?\n\n24:15.700 --> 24:18.700\nDuring the game show, they're in the background like selling donuts\n\n24:18.700 --> 24:22.700\nAnd Trebek is standing up there, and Trebek doesn't give a fuck anymore\n\n24:22.700 --> 24:24.700\nTrebek is like, I'm done with this\n\n24:24.700 --> 24:28.700\nSo the episode is going on, and it's me and two other contestants\n\n24:28.700 --> 24:31.700\nAnd he's talking to us, he's asking us about ourselves\n\n24:31.700 --> 24:34.700\nBut he never gets around to actually asking any questions\n\n24:34.700 --> 24:37.700\nSo halfway through the show, suddenly people in the audience start screaming out\n\n24:37.700 --> 24:39.700\nTrebek, ask a question!\n\n24:39.700 --> 24:41.700\nAnd he just sort of glares at them and goes back\n\n24:41.700 --> 24:44.700\nAnd he starts asking me again about, you know, what I do for a living\n\n24:44.700 --> 24:47.700\nAnd it still says zero underneath me\n\n24:47.700 --> 24:50.700\nAnd meanwhile, they're making donuts in the background\n\n24:50.700 --> 24:53.700\nI'm actually thinking, that donut looks pretty good\n\n24:53.700 --> 24:57.700\nAlright, so corporate America has changed the media escape to a point where\n\n24:57.700 --> 25:01.700\nAlthough you're a nice guy and feel fulfilled and know who you are\n\n25:01.700 --> 25:04.700\nThe clock is running out on your life and you're not achieving anything\n\n25:04.700 --> 25:06.700\nThat's pretty good\n\n25:10.700 --> 25:14.700\nSo literally today, I go and I run into my brother-in-law\n\n25:14.700 --> 25:16.700\nAnd the first thing he says out of his mouth is\n\n25:16.700 --> 25:18.700\nHey, they're opening a new Dunkin' Donuts in Encino!\n\n25:18.700 --> 25:20.700\nWhat?!\n\n25:20.700 --> 25:23.700\nYou were, I don't know what that meant, but\n\n25:23.700 --> 25:27.700\nLike the first thing, like today, it's following me\n\n25:27.700 --> 25:28.700\nThat's weird\n\n25:28.700 --> 25:29.700\nIt's bizarre\n\n25:29.700 --> 25:31.700\nI mean, I know Dunkin' Donuts aren't rare\n\n25:31.700 --> 25:33.700\nBut that's definitely weird\n\n25:33.700 --> 25:36.700\nI haven't heard the word Dunkin' Donuts all week\n\n25:36.700 --> 25:39.700\nIf I dreamt about a Dunkin' Donuts and someone mentioned it\n\n25:39.700 --> 25:42.700\nThat would be, I would consider that notable\n\n25:42.700 --> 25:44.700\nNotable evidence of paranormal activity\n\n25:44.700 --> 25:47.700\nThat's why the very first thing I brought up on your podcast right now\n\n25:47.700 --> 25:50.700\nWas my Dunkin' Donuts stream for some strange reason\n\n25:50.700 --> 25:55.700\nThere was one story of the sleep paralysis thing where the guy was talking\n\n25:55.700 --> 25:58.700\nHe told a story about how there was a demon standing over him\n\n25:58.700 --> 26:01.700\nAnd telling him, you're gonna die, I'm a demon\n\n26:04.700 --> 26:06.700\nBut then his girlfriend sat up screaming\n\n26:06.700 --> 26:08.700\nYeah, but she said that said demon on it\n\n26:11.700 --> 26:14.700\nDemon with two D's for a double dose of this\n\n26:14.700 --> 26:15.700\nA demon\n\n26:15.700 --> 26:16.700\nUm\n\n26:19.700 --> 26:21.700\nHis girlfriend sat up screaming\n\n26:21.700 --> 26:23.700\nAnd she was having a night terror\n\n26:23.700 --> 26:25.700\nAnd in her nightmare\n\n26:25.700 --> 26:28.700\nThere was a cat sitting on her chest\n\n26:28.700 --> 26:31.700\nSpeaking in gibberish to her boyfriend\n\n26:31.700 --> 26:33.700\nAt the same time\n\n26:33.700 --> 26:35.700\nBut the cat, it was a giant black cat\n\n26:35.700 --> 26:37.700\nAnd a lot of people report that\n\n26:37.700 --> 26:39.700\nI think it's just an explanation for this giant\n\n26:39.700 --> 26:44.700\nYour mind is trying to put an object on something that makes no sense\n\n26:44.700 --> 26:47.700\nAnd a lot of people make it a big black cat\n\n26:47.700 --> 26:49.700\nHer big black cat had red eyes\n\n26:49.700 --> 26:51.700\nAnd so did this demon\n\n26:51.700 --> 26:53.700\nAt that point in the documentary I said\n\n26:53.700 --> 26:55.700\nI don't know if I believe that\n\n26:55.700 --> 26:57.700\nAnd Aaron said why\n\n26:57.700 --> 27:01.700\nBecause that's kind of like confirmed proof of supernatural activity\n\n27:01.700 --> 27:08.700\nI'm not like a cynical skeptic about things for no reason\n\n27:08.700 --> 27:10.700\nBut then again I take it very seriously\n\n27:10.700 --> 27:12.700\nIf somebody asserts like Jeff does\n\n27:12.700 --> 27:14.700\nThat he predicted 9-11 when his dream\n\n27:14.700 --> 27:15.700\nYou know it's like\n\n27:15.700 --> 27:18.700\nI just get really quiet and wait for Kumail to\n\n27:18.700 --> 27:21.700\nStart point making fun of him\n\n27:21.700 --> 27:23.700\nHe did that and I predicted the Dunkin Donuts in Encino\n\n27:23.700 --> 27:24.700\nSo it's kinda\n\n27:24.700 --> 27:26.700\nBut that's right on the bubble\n\n27:26.700 --> 27:28.700\nI mean that's intriguing to me\n\n27:28.700 --> 27:30.700\nBecause I feel like that's possible\n\n27:30.700 --> 27:33.700\nIt's too coincidental that she's dreaming of a black cat with red eyes\n\n27:33.700 --> 27:35.700\nAnd there's a demon with red eyes\n\n27:35.700 --> 27:37.700\nI don't know, I feel like someone's lying\n\n27:37.700 --> 27:41.700\nBut what do you make of this paranormal shenanigans?\n\n27:41.700 --> 27:43.700\nI mean I like, I just\n\n27:43.700 --> 27:46.700\nWhat's strange about that one is that those two events were happening\n\n27:46.700 --> 27:48.700\nSupposedly at the exact same time\n\n27:48.700 --> 27:49.700\nWhich is very weird\n\n27:49.700 --> 27:51.700\nAaron said well this guy has this thing happen to him every night\n\n27:51.700 --> 27:54.700\nIn one form or another so it's only a matter of statistics\n\n27:54.700 --> 27:57.700\nWell then it would make sense that she was having nightmares like that\n\n27:57.700 --> 27:59.700\nBecause if this happens to him all the time\n\n27:59.700 --> 28:00.700\nThat's a good point\n\n28:00.700 --> 28:01.700\nYeah\n\n28:01.700 --> 28:04.700\nHave you heard the stories of the people who actually can't fall asleep\n\n28:04.700 --> 28:07.700\nAnd after a couple of weeks of not sleeping\n\n28:07.700 --> 28:10.700\nThey start to actually hallucinate the things that they're dreaming\n\n28:10.700 --> 28:12.700\nThat they're actually dreaming but they're awake\n\n28:12.700 --> 28:14.700\nI've been in that state\n\n28:14.700 --> 28:15.700\nYeah\n\n28:15.700 --> 28:17.700\nToward the end of every season\n\n28:18.700 --> 28:20.700\nI'll go a couple days without sleep\n\n28:20.700 --> 28:24.700\nBut there's a sort of delusional state that sets in\n\n28:24.700 --> 28:26.700\nWhich is actually really cool\n\n28:26.700 --> 28:30.700\nAnd you stop needing as much sleep\n\n28:30.700 --> 28:33.700\nThe same way you've heard this\n\n28:33.700 --> 28:35.700\nAnd may probably experience it\n\n28:35.700 --> 28:38.700\nYour body suppresses illness\n\n28:38.700 --> 28:40.700\nLike your body has this sense of like\n\n28:40.700 --> 28:43.700\nWell she needs to get her work done at the hospital\n\n28:43.700 --> 28:45.700\nOr whatever for this week\n\n28:45.700 --> 28:46.700\nThis is a rough week\n\n28:46.700 --> 28:48.700\nAnd you feel like you're maybe gonna get sick\n\n28:48.700 --> 28:50.700\nOr you've been exposed to all these colds and stuff\n\n28:50.700 --> 28:51.700\nAnd you're not getting sick\n\n28:51.700 --> 28:53.700\nAnd you're just like I guess I just don't get sick\n\n28:53.700 --> 28:56.700\nAnd then the week ends and you just like collapse into mucus\n\n28:56.700 --> 28:58.700\nLike because your body's like yeah fuck you\n\n28:58.700 --> 29:00.700\nYou were sick the whole time\n\n29:00.700 --> 29:02.700\nBut the same thing\n\n29:02.700 --> 29:04.700\nIt works that way with sleep too I think\n\n29:04.700 --> 29:06.700\nAfter a while after a certain amount of sleep deprivation\n\n29:06.700 --> 29:08.700\nKids try this\n\n29:10.700 --> 29:13.700\nYou can actually just like sleep for 20 minutes at a time\n\n29:13.700 --> 29:15.700\nAnd then just when you wake up\n\n29:15.700 --> 29:17.700\nAnd it's like there's no way you got enough sleep\n\n29:17.700 --> 29:20.700\nBut your body is just now on the Atkins diet of sleep\n\n29:20.700 --> 29:22.700\nWhere it's like just give me a little nibble of ham\n\n29:22.700 --> 29:24.700\nJust give me something\n\n29:24.700 --> 29:25.700\nI don't need this knickers bar\n\n29:25.700 --> 29:27.700\nI don't need to sleep for 8 hours\n\n29:27.700 --> 29:28.700\nBut I get it you're an asshole\n\n29:28.700 --> 29:31.700\nGive me a little berry from a bush\n\n29:31.700 --> 29:33.700\nSo I can keep going\n\n29:33.700 --> 29:34.700\nIt's pretty cool\n\n29:34.700 --> 29:37.700\nBecause I will fall asleep while typing\n\n29:37.700 --> 29:40.700\nAnd then you wake up and then you read\n\n29:40.700 --> 29:42.700\nJust weird shit\n\n29:42.700 --> 29:47.700\nAnd then I would fall asleep in writer's rooms\n\n29:47.700 --> 29:50.700\nAnd I'm kind of like half like I'm still asleep\n\n29:50.700 --> 29:52.700\nBut my eyes are open and I'm just saying something\n\n29:52.700 --> 29:55.700\nLike I'll just start to be like\n\n29:55.700 --> 29:58.700\nWell what if Annie's jealous of Britta\n\n29:58.700 --> 30:00.700\nAnd so she does this and then I'll go\n\n30:00.700 --> 30:04.700\nUh, what about Minecraft?\n\n30:04.700 --> 30:06.700\nOr something that else that's out of like\n\n30:06.700 --> 30:07.700\nFrom other part of my brain\n\n30:07.700 --> 30:09.700\nAnd everyone will get this weird look on their face\n\n30:09.700 --> 30:10.700\nAnd I'll get embarrassed\n\n30:10.700 --> 30:12.700\nAnd I'll go take a nap in my office\n\n30:12.700 --> 30:13.700\nSounds healthy\n\n30:13.700 --> 30:14.700\nYeah\n\n30:14.700 --> 30:16.700\nBut it made the show so good\n\n30:16.700 --> 30:18.700\nUm\n\n30:18.700 --> 30:21.700\nAgain\n\n30:21.700 --> 30:23.700\nI can tell when it's lies\n\n30:23.700 --> 30:25.700\nI'm not interested\n\n30:25.700 --> 30:26.700\nI'll tell, look I know\n\n30:26.700 --> 30:27.700\nThat's you guys saying\n\n30:27.700 --> 30:28.700\nHey we enjoyed season 6\n\n30:28.700 --> 30:29.700\nAnd thank you very much for saying that\n\n30:29.700 --> 30:30.700\nAll over Twitter too\n\n30:30.700 --> 30:31.700\nThank you\n\n30:31.700 --> 30:32.700\nHam girl\n\n30:32.700 --> 30:34.700\nThat keeps me going\n\n30:34.700 --> 30:35.700\nBut\n\n30:41.700 --> 30:43.700\nOh no please they're standing up in the back\n\n30:43.700 --> 30:45.700\nOh no don't everybody stand up\n\n30:45.700 --> 30:47.700\nI thought that might work\n\n30:47.700 --> 30:49.700\nI thought if everyone thought a standing o\n\n30:49.700 --> 30:50.700\nWas happening behind them\n\n30:50.700 --> 30:52.700\nYou could like start one from the back\n\n30:52.700 --> 30:55.700\nUh\n\n30:55.700 --> 30:57.700\nNot like the real standing o I got\n\n30:57.700 --> 30:58.700\nWhen I wrote those Oscars\n\n30:58.700 --> 31:00.700\nThat Hugh Jackman hosted\n\n31:00.700 --> 31:02.700\nSean Penn just fucking leaped to his feet\n\n31:02.700 --> 31:03.700\nHe was like\n\n31:03.700 --> 31:04.700\nYes best Oscars ever\n\n31:04.700 --> 31:05.700\nThat's amazing\n\n31:05.700 --> 31:06.700\nAnd then Ed Harris was like\n\n31:06.700 --> 31:08.700\nI agree I don't care\n\n31:08.700 --> 31:10.700\nMorgan Freeman was like\n\n31:10.700 --> 31:12.700\nYeah\n\n31:15.700 --> 31:17.700\nUm so uh\n\n31:17.700 --> 31:18.700\nSo by the way\n\n31:18.700 --> 31:20.700\nNational Treasure Curtis Armstrong\n\n31:20.700 --> 31:23.700\nNational Treasure Curtis Armstrong\n\n31:23.700 --> 31:24.700\nOh oh oh I thought\n\n31:24.700 --> 31:26.700\nHe wasn't in National Treasure\n\n31:26.700 --> 31:28.700\nThat's Steve Zahn\n\n31:31.700 --> 31:32.700\nThat was very nice of you\n\n31:32.700 --> 31:33.700\nThank you\n\n31:33.700 --> 31:34.700\nNo he's I mean\n\n31:34.700 --> 31:35.700\nIt's right\n\n31:35.700 --> 31:36.700\nYeah don't get me started\n\n31:36.700 --> 31:37.700\nIt's the guy\n\n31:37.700 --> 31:39.700\nWell it's one of those guys\n\n31:39.700 --> 31:41.700\nOne of those guys\n\n31:41.700 --> 31:43.700\nThe K-12 dude\n\n31:43.700 --> 31:45.700\nThe K-12 dude\n\n31:45.700 --> 31:48.700\nYeah\n\n31:48.700 --> 31:50.700\nI get a lot of tweets from youngsters\n\n31:50.700 --> 31:52.700\nNow that are watching better off dead\n\n31:52.700 --> 31:53.700\nBecause they\n\n31:53.700 --> 31:54.700\nBecause you became a friend of the show\n\n31:54.700 --> 31:56.700\nThey'd never seen it\n\n31:56.700 --> 31:57.700\nWhich I'm exceptionally proud of\n\n31:57.700 --> 31:59.700\nBecause that movie does hold up and is awesome\n\n31:59.700 --> 32:01.700\nAnd it's like nice to see somebody go\n\n32:01.700 --> 32:02.700\nHoly shit I just rented this\n\n32:02.700 --> 32:03.700\nI never would have\n\n32:03.700 --> 32:04.700\nAnd it's so amazing\n\n32:04.700 --> 32:07.700\nI know I really like seeing those\n\n32:07.700 --> 32:08.700\nThat's really nice\n\n32:08.700 --> 32:09.700\nYeah\n\n32:09.700 --> 32:11.700\nShit okay so\n\n32:11.700 --> 32:12.700\nWhat the fuck was that\n\n32:12.700 --> 32:13.700\nWe were gonna talk about TV\n\n32:13.700 --> 32:14.700\nProbably I assume\n\n32:14.700 --> 32:16.700\nBut what with the\n\n32:16.700 --> 32:17.700\nYeah don't\n\n32:17.700 --> 32:18.700\nYes everybody gets lots of sleep\n\n32:18.700 --> 32:20.700\nUm\n\n32:20.700 --> 32:21.700\nAlright\n\n32:21.700 --> 32:22.700\nWell yeah let's talk about TV\n\n32:22.700 --> 32:25.700\nSo it's the Golden Age of Television\n\n32:25.700 --> 32:29.700\nWhich is true because TV is higher quality\n\n32:29.700 --> 32:30.700\nThan the movies\n\n32:30.700 --> 32:32.700\nBecause movies are big international business\n\n32:32.700 --> 32:35.700\nSo we're just churning out these like giant movies\n\n32:35.700 --> 32:38.700\nAnd the weird cultural shift is now that\n\n32:38.700 --> 32:40.700\nYeah you look at Disney and Warner Brothers\n\n32:40.700 --> 32:41.700\nAnd the majority of\n\n32:41.700 --> 32:43.700\nIt's the big DC or Marvel franchises\n\n32:43.700 --> 32:45.700\nOr what they're kind of focusing on\n\n32:45.700 --> 32:46.700\nOr also some Pixar in the future\n\n32:46.700 --> 32:48.700\nBut really that's what the movies now are\n\n32:48.700 --> 32:49.700\nSo all the other stuff\n\n32:49.700 --> 32:51.700\nYeah and you're averaging out\n\n32:51.700 --> 32:52.700\nInstead of making like\n\n32:52.700 --> 32:54.700\nSomething that's about an insight into\n\n32:54.700 --> 32:56.700\nFor instance like American\n\n32:56.700 --> 32:57.700\nDomestic culture\n\n32:57.700 --> 32:59.700\nAnd then exporting it\n\n32:59.700 --> 33:01.700\nTo other countries as television\n\n33:01.700 --> 33:03.700\nWhere there could still be that cultural like\n\n33:03.700 --> 33:04.700\nOh this is an American show\n\n33:04.700 --> 33:06.700\nI know that going in\n\n33:06.700 --> 33:08.700\nLike the movies are like\n\n33:08.700 --> 33:10.700\nThe American audience is like a fraction\n\n33:10.700 --> 33:12.700\nOf the box office that they even care about\n\n33:12.700 --> 33:15.700\nDidn't they release the New Avengers movie\n\n33:15.700 --> 33:17.700\nIn China before here\n\n33:17.700 --> 33:20.700\nOr it was like America was like the last\n\n33:20.700 --> 33:22.700\nYeah and you know what's interesting too\n\n33:22.700 --> 33:24.700\nIs now they're having to sort of\n\n33:24.700 --> 33:26.700\nThere are certain things they won't do\n\n33:26.700 --> 33:27.700\nIn some of these big movies now\n\n33:27.700 --> 33:29.700\nBecause China is such a large percentage\n\n33:29.700 --> 33:31.700\nOf the box office\n\n33:31.700 --> 33:33.700\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg\n\n33:33.700 --> 33:34.700\nIn terms of like the effect of\n\n33:34.700 --> 33:37.700\nIf you're making a movie for an entire planet\n\n33:37.700 --> 33:40.700\nAnd you need it to be this big crazy movie\n\n33:40.700 --> 33:42.700\nAnd obviously a byproduct of that\n\n33:42.700 --> 33:44.700\nI mean one effect of that is that\n\n33:44.700 --> 33:45.700\nCG is going to get really good\n\n33:45.700 --> 33:47.700\nAnd it really has and it's amazing\n\n33:47.700 --> 33:48.700\nWe can do anything now\n\n33:48.700 --> 33:49.700\nAnd to the point where I was watching Mad Max\n\n33:49.700 --> 33:51.700\nI had no idea\n\n33:51.700 --> 33:53.700\nEveryone that keeps walking out of Mad Max\n\n33:53.700 --> 33:54.700\nIs always saying the same thing\n\n33:54.700 --> 33:55.700\nThey're all going\n\n33:55.700 --> 33:56.700\nI don't know how they did that\n\n33:56.700 --> 33:57.700\nAnd I literally mean\n\n33:57.700 --> 33:58.700\nI don't know how they did that\n\n33:58.700 --> 33:59.700\nI don't know if that was a practical car\n\n33:59.700 --> 34:00.700\nFlipping through the air\n\n34:00.700 --> 34:02.700\nOr maybe the tire was CG\n\n34:02.700 --> 34:03.700\nBut the car wasn't\n\n34:03.700 --> 34:06.700\nWeirdly, I know something about that\n\n34:06.700 --> 34:09.700\nWhich I usually don't\n\n34:09.700 --> 34:11.700\nBut I happen to know something about that\n\n34:11.700 --> 34:13.700\nBecause of Genevieve Pearson\n\n34:13.700 --> 34:15.700\nWho you know\n\n34:15.700 --> 34:17.700\nGenevieve, we love Genevieve from\n\n34:17.700 --> 34:19.700\nKing of the Nerds\n\n34:19.700 --> 34:20.700\nAnd she did some research on it\n\n34:20.700 --> 34:27.700\nEvery car effect is practical\n\n34:27.700 --> 34:29.700\nThey may have layered stuff over it\n\n34:29.700 --> 34:33.700\nBut all of the car stuff is practical\n\n34:33.700 --> 34:35.700\nThere are other things that are CGI\n\n34:35.700 --> 34:38.700\nBut a vast amount of that movie\n\n34:38.700 --> 34:40.700\nWas actual practical stuff\n\n34:40.700 --> 34:42.700\nAnd the guitar guy\n\n34:42.700 --> 34:43.700\nAnd the guitar guy\n\n34:43.700 --> 34:44.700\nWas a real guy\n\n34:44.700 --> 34:46.700\nWe love the guitar guy\n\n34:46.700 --> 34:50.700\nYou would expect a movie like that to be\n\n34:50.700 --> 34:52.700\nIt just doesn't look like\n\n34:52.700 --> 34:55.700\nTo me, I'm not a big fan of his movies\n\n34:55.700 --> 34:59.700\nBut it doesn't look like a CGI movie to me\n\n34:59.700 --> 35:02.700\nEven at the parts where I know it has to be\n\n35:02.700 --> 35:04.700\nThere are moments of that movie\n\n35:04.700 --> 35:06.700\nThat I thought were just beautiful\n\n35:06.700 --> 35:08.700\nIt seems like the camera is always\n\n35:08.700 --> 35:09.700\nIn the perfect position\n\n35:09.700 --> 35:12.700\nWhich is the effect of the CG\n\n35:12.700 --> 35:16.700\nWith media scape\n\n35:16.700 --> 35:18.700\nEntourage on the other hand\n\n35:18.700 --> 35:21.700\nAll CG\n\n35:21.700 --> 35:24.700\nIncluding the script\n\n35:24.700 --> 35:29.700\nWow\n\n35:29.700 --> 35:31.700\nI don't know where those three booze\n\n35:31.700 --> 35:33.700\nWere coming from\n\n35:33.700 --> 35:35.700\nI have never seen a frame of entourage\n\n35:35.700 --> 35:38.700\nAnd I'm fine\n\n35:38.700 --> 35:40.700\nOh, you got some binging to do\n\n35:40.700 --> 35:42.700\nI told that to somebody\n\n35:42.700 --> 35:43.700\nAnd they said, actually\n\n35:43.700 --> 35:45.700\nThey kind of studied me for a second\n\n35:45.700 --> 35:47.700\nAs they mulled it over in their head\n\n35:47.700 --> 35:49.700\nAnd they said, I think you're\n\n35:49.700 --> 35:51.700\nExperiencing entourage the right way\n\n35:51.700 --> 35:55.700\nIt's like trickling through the water table\n\n35:55.700 --> 35:56.700\nTo you\n\n35:56.700 --> 35:58.700\nIt's like, you don't need to see any episodes\n\n35:58.700 --> 35:59.700\nIt's more of a...\n\n35:59.700 --> 36:01.700\nThat's how I experience the real housewives\n\n36:01.700 --> 36:03.700\nI never actually watch them\n\n36:03.700 --> 36:05.700\nI just kind of, for whatever reason\n\n36:05.700 --> 36:06.700\nIf you live in this culture\n\n36:06.700 --> 36:08.700\nYou sort of just know what's going on\n\n36:08.700 --> 36:10.700\nIn the show shows?\n\n36:10.700 --> 36:12.700\nYeah, there's no...\n\n36:12.700 --> 36:14.700\nSo the movies are\n\n36:14.700 --> 36:18.700\nVisually\n\n36:18.700 --> 36:20.700\nIncredible\n\n36:20.700 --> 36:22.700\nAnd with the exception of your\n\n36:22.700 --> 36:23.700\nOdd Mad Max or two\n\n36:23.700 --> 36:25.700\nThey're all kind of dumb\n\n36:25.700 --> 36:26.700\nWhereas TV\n\n36:26.700 --> 36:27.700\nUntil we get...\n\n36:27.700 --> 36:28.700\nI don't know\n\n36:28.700 --> 36:30.700\nBecause it's cheaper now\n\n36:30.700 --> 36:31.700\nAnd it's lower stakes\n\n36:31.700 --> 36:33.700\nIt's getting really, you know\n\n36:33.700 --> 36:34.700\nGood\n\n36:34.700 --> 36:37.700\nHe said at a weird octave\n\n36:37.700 --> 36:38.700\nAnd getting gooder\n\n36:38.700 --> 36:41.700\nIt's getting good\n\n36:41.700 --> 36:43.700\nAnd there's lots of shitty shows\n\n36:43.700 --> 36:44.700\nBut there's so many\n\n36:44.700 --> 36:46.700\nThat there's something for everybody\n\n36:46.700 --> 36:48.700\nAnd there's all kinds of amazing stuff happening\n\n36:48.700 --> 36:49.700\nSo\n\n36:49.700 --> 36:51.700\nOne part of this Golden Age of TV\n\n36:51.700 --> 36:53.700\nIs serialization\n\n36:53.700 --> 36:55.700\nLike, you know one can argue\n\n36:55.700 --> 36:57.700\nThat Breaking Bad wasn't a great show\n\n36:57.700 --> 36:58.700\nWell, someone can\n\n36:58.700 --> 37:00.700\nI'm sure\n\n37:00.700 --> 37:03.700\nWho is that person?\n\n37:03.700 --> 37:06.700\nRoger\n\n37:06.700 --> 37:08.700\nRoger\n\n37:08.700 --> 37:09.700\nRoger\n\n37:09.700 --> 37:11.700\nRoger\n\n37:11.700 --> 37:13.700\nThat guy's an ass\n\n37:13.700 --> 37:15.700\nHe probably doesn't like Breaking Bad\n\n37:15.700 --> 37:16.700\nYeah\n\n37:16.700 --> 37:17.700\nSomebody's got to push back\n\n37:17.700 --> 37:18.700\nBut anyways\n\n37:18.700 --> 37:19.700\nI'm saying like\n\n37:19.700 --> 37:21.700\nThere's no more serialized show\n\n37:21.700 --> 37:22.700\nI mean, he just did Macbeth\n\n37:22.700 --> 37:23.700\nOver five years\n\n37:23.700 --> 37:25.700\nAnd slowly spiraled this character\n\n37:25.700 --> 37:27.700\nInto this beautiful\n\n37:27.700 --> 37:28.700\nDemise of spoilers\n\n37:28.700 --> 37:30.700\nBut the...\n\n37:30.700 --> 37:31.700\nHe breaks bad\n\n37:31.700 --> 37:32.700\nAnd then it gets worse\n\n37:32.700 --> 37:36.700\nBut\n\n37:36.700 --> 37:37.700\nSo here's me\n\n37:37.700 --> 37:38.700\nAnd it's not just because\n\n37:38.700 --> 37:39.700\nI'm a sitcom guy\n\n37:39.700 --> 37:40.700\nI don't think\n\n37:40.700 --> 37:42.700\nLike, I have this like\n\n37:42.700 --> 37:43.700\nIs it...\n\n37:43.700 --> 37:46.700\nIs my...\n\n37:46.700 --> 37:48.700\nAversion to serialization\n\n37:48.700 --> 37:50.700\nIs my view of serialization\n\n37:50.700 --> 37:51.700\nAs a crutch\n\n37:51.700 --> 37:52.700\nAs bad craftsmanship\n\n37:52.700 --> 37:53.700\nIs that a...\n\n37:53.700 --> 37:54.700\nIs that now officially\n\n37:54.700 --> 37:55.700\nA hang-up that I have?\n\n37:55.700 --> 37:57.700\nSo I need to let that go\n\n37:57.700 --> 38:01.700\nYou just...\n\n38:01.700 --> 38:03.700\nGeorge R.R. Martin is in the back\n\n38:07.700 --> 38:09.700\nWhat is it specifically\n\n38:09.700 --> 38:10.700\nAbout the serialization?\n\n38:10.700 --> 38:12.700\nIt feels like cheating\n\n38:12.700 --> 38:14.700\nBecause I grew up in the 80s\n\n38:14.700 --> 38:16.700\nOn TV that was like\n\n38:16.700 --> 38:18.700\nSo supremely crafted\n\n38:18.700 --> 38:19.700\nNo matter how dumb it was\n\n38:19.700 --> 38:21.700\nThere was a sense of craftsmanship\n\n38:21.700 --> 38:23.700\nNobody in Shears ever made a...\n\n38:23.700 --> 38:25.700\nPicked up a Rubik's Cube\n\n38:25.700 --> 38:27.700\nBecause it was in the headlines that week\n\n38:27.700 --> 38:29.700\nI'm sure there's...\n\n38:29.700 --> 38:30.700\nIt's not like the shows aren't dated\n\n38:30.700 --> 38:32.700\nBut there was also the...\n\n38:32.700 --> 38:34.700\nThe attempt was for timelessness\n\n38:34.700 --> 38:36.700\nAnd the attempt was for perfect modularity usually\n\n38:36.700 --> 38:38.700\nAnd then when...\n\n38:38.700 --> 38:40.700\nIt's that shark-jumping thing\n\n38:40.700 --> 38:42.700\nOr the actual etymology of shark-jumping\n\n38:42.700 --> 38:43.700\nBeing from serialization\n\n38:43.700 --> 38:45.700\nWhen the shows start to get desperate\n\n38:45.700 --> 38:47.700\nThey start saying to be continued\n\n38:47.700 --> 38:49.700\nAnd I guess that's the association I make\n\n38:49.700 --> 38:51.700\nIt's like you're starting to...\n\n38:51.700 --> 38:53.700\nI started to feel like when\n\n38:53.700 --> 38:55.700\nThe internet really started to threaten TV\n\n38:55.700 --> 38:58.700\nThat's when we saw TV start to do like\n\n38:58.700 --> 39:00.700\nReally quickly\n\n39:00.700 --> 39:02.700\nIt was all this like\n\n39:02.700 --> 39:04.700\nWhat I regard as a dirty trick on the audience\n\n39:04.700 --> 39:06.700\nTo like throw some weird\n\n39:06.700 --> 39:08.700\nNonsensical thing at the end of an episode\n\n39:08.700 --> 39:10.700\nAnd then go, huh?\n\n39:10.700 --> 39:12.700\nNow what are you going to watch next week?\n\n39:12.700 --> 39:14.700\nAnd it feels like you're holding them hostage\n\n39:14.700 --> 39:16.700\nIt's not the same as Breaking Bad\n\n39:16.700 --> 39:18.700\nWhich is like...\n\n39:18.700 --> 39:20.700\nBut I've always...\n\n39:20.700 --> 39:22.700\nPeople have heard me rant about\n\n39:22.700 --> 39:24.700\nEverything I've ever ranted about\n\n39:24.700 --> 39:26.700\nThat makes sense to me Breaking Bad broke that rule\n\n39:26.700 --> 39:27.700\nAnd did it well\n\n39:27.700 --> 39:29.700\nI think the difference is now that\n\n39:29.700 --> 39:31.700\nBecause of the way we now watch TV\n\n39:31.700 --> 39:33.700\nYou can watch it back to back\n\n39:33.700 --> 39:35.700\nAnd back in the day before DVRs\n\n39:35.700 --> 39:37.700\nBefore streaming\n\n39:37.700 --> 39:39.700\nYou missed episodes\n\n39:39.700 --> 39:41.700\nNo one watched an entire run of any series\n\n39:41.700 --> 39:43.700\nBecause you might be out one week\n\n39:43.700 --> 39:45.700\nYou might miss a couple episodes\n\n39:45.700 --> 39:47.700\nSo they had to be kind of self-contained\n\n39:47.700 --> 39:49.700\nSo you could jump in and out\n\n39:49.700 --> 39:51.700\nAnd now you don't have to do that\n\n39:51.700 --> 39:53.700\nMost shows, if you really like a show\n\n39:53.700 --> 39:55.700\nYou are going to watch every episode\n\n39:55.700 --> 39:57.700\nAnd there are fans who want to\n\n39:57.700 --> 39:59.700\nGet to know these characters\n\n39:59.700 --> 40:01.700\nAnd who want to go on this journey\n\n40:01.700 --> 40:03.700\nWith these people\n\n40:03.700 --> 40:05.700\nI think there's something for everyone\n\n40:05.700 --> 40:07.700\nWhat's weird is even though\n\n40:07.700 --> 40:09.700\nAll these shows now are serialized\n\n40:09.700 --> 40:11.700\nShonda Rhimes is making billions\n\n40:11.700 --> 40:13.700\nOut of serialization\n\n40:13.700 --> 40:15.700\nBut then you also have Dick Wolf\n\n40:15.700 --> 40:17.700\nWho suddenly has four shows on the air this fall\n\n40:17.700 --> 40:19.700\nAll of those shows are actually still self-contained\n\n40:19.700 --> 40:21.700\nThey all take place in Chicago\n\n40:21.700 --> 40:23.700\nSo if you're like fire, then you got one\n\n40:23.700 --> 40:25.700\nIf you're like PD, you got one\n\n40:25.700 --> 40:27.700\nThat's much more like the serial\n\n40:27.700 --> 40:29.700\nStyle of\n\n40:29.700 --> 40:31.700\nPick whichever serial you like\n\n40:31.700 --> 40:33.700\nDo you think Dick Wolf is still actively making TV\n\n40:33.700 --> 40:35.700\nOr do you think he's in a glass coffin?\n\n40:37.700 --> 40:39.700\nHas anyone ever seen him?\n\n40:39.700 --> 40:41.700\nI think he's under Mount Rushmore\n\n40:41.700 --> 40:43.700\nAnd the people are fanning him\n\n40:43.700 --> 40:45.700\nOr pumping fluid\n\n40:45.700 --> 40:47.700\nInto some kind of chamber\n\n40:47.700 --> 40:49.700\nI don't even think there's scripts coming out\n\n40:49.700 --> 40:51.700\nI think it's just like\n\n40:51.700 --> 40:53.700\nSome young writer comes in\n\n40:53.700 --> 40:55.700\nAnd smears\n\n40:55.700 --> 40:57.700\nSome of the embalming fluid\n\n40:57.700 --> 40:59.700\nOn his face like war paint\n\n40:59.700 --> 41:01.700\nAnd goes\n\n41:01.700 --> 41:03.700\nAnd then he charges out on a horse\n\n41:03.700 --> 41:05.700\nTo a typewriter and creates a new law and order\n\n41:09.700 --> 41:11.700\nPlease note\n\n41:11.700 --> 41:13.700\nI'm still saying Dick Wolf is a very valuable player\n\n41:13.700 --> 41:15.700\nIn the television industry\n\n41:15.700 --> 41:17.700\nThere is a contribution there\n\n41:17.700 --> 41:19.700\nI just think it's more spiritual\n\n41:19.700 --> 41:21.700\nRitualistic probably\n\n41:21.700 --> 41:23.700\nHe's making a lot of money\n\n41:23.700 --> 41:25.700\nHe is out there\n\n41:25.700 --> 41:27.700\nHe's kind of the master of it all\n\n41:27.700 --> 41:29.700\nYou're not going to get me to\n\n41:29.700 --> 41:31.700\nPoopoo all over Dick Wolf\n\n41:31.700 --> 41:33.700\nOh man, are you kidding me?\n\n41:33.700 --> 41:35.700\nI hope my work speaks for itself\n\n41:35.700 --> 41:37.700\nI've made love to Dick Wolf\n\n41:37.700 --> 41:39.700\nSeveral occasions\n\n41:43.700 --> 41:45.700\nI hope not during SBU though\n\n41:45.700 --> 41:47.700\nJust please not during SBU\n\n41:47.700 --> 41:49.700\nHow much is his name though\n\n41:49.700 --> 41:51.700\nBecause it's like perfect\n\n41:51.700 --> 41:53.700\nThe episode's end\n\n41:53.700 --> 41:55.700\nHe hung himself while masturbating\n\n41:55.700 --> 41:57.700\nAnd then it just says Dick Wolf\n\n41:57.700 --> 41:59.700\nIt's like\n\n41:59.700 --> 42:01.700\nSuch a visceral, it's like a mic drop\n\n42:01.700 --> 42:03.700\nIt's like\n\n42:03.700 --> 42:05.700\nDick Wolf\n\n42:07.700 --> 42:09.700\nDick Wolf before he dicks you\n\n42:09.700 --> 42:11.700\nIt would be too\n\n42:11.700 --> 42:13.700\nOn the nose to\n\n42:13.700 --> 42:15.700\nIf it was Wolf Dick\n\n42:15.700 --> 42:17.700\nThis is childish\n\n42:17.700 --> 42:19.700\nSo it still looks like a name\n\n42:19.700 --> 42:21.700\nBut you're getting all those ingredients\n\n42:21.700 --> 42:23.700\nIt's like Dick\n\n42:23.700 --> 42:25.700\nWolf\n\n42:25.700 --> 42:27.700\nPretty strong, right?\n\n42:27.700 --> 42:29.700\nYeah, strong, strong\n\n42:29.700 --> 42:31.700\nIt sends the subliminal signal\n\n42:31.700 --> 42:33.700\nI just watched a strong show\n\n42:37.700 --> 42:39.700\nThat overreacts to the moon\n\n42:39.700 --> 42:41.700\nThe\n\n42:41.700 --> 42:43.700\nOkay, so yeah, okay\n\n42:43.700 --> 42:45.700\nI've reached a verdict\n\n42:45.700 --> 42:47.700\nIt's a hang up of mine for a bad reason\n\n42:47.700 --> 42:49.700\nIn childhood, I was watching\n\n42:49.700 --> 42:51.700\nTelevision that was produced by people\n\n42:51.700 --> 42:53.700\nThat were much like the people producing features\n\n42:53.700 --> 42:55.700\nToday, they were afraid\n\n42:55.700 --> 42:57.700\nTo engage the audience\n\n42:57.700 --> 42:59.700\nToo much narratively\n\n42:59.700 --> 43:01.700\nBecause it was ratings poison\n\n43:01.700 --> 43:03.700\nAnd that's not craftsmanship\n\n43:03.700 --> 43:05.700\nThat's corporate\n\n43:05.700 --> 43:07.700\nJust manufacturing\n\n43:07.700 --> 43:09.700\nBut that's like me saying\n\n43:09.700 --> 43:11.700\nI don't know, is it me or is Lucky Charms\n\n43:11.700 --> 43:13.700\nBetter than Flay Mignon\n\n43:13.700 --> 43:15.700\nIt's like, come on, don't be a dope\n\n43:17.700 --> 43:19.700\nI mean, I'm no foodie, but it's like\n\n43:19.700 --> 43:21.700\nYeah\n\n43:21.700 --> 43:23.700\nI think because back when we were growing up\n\n43:23.700 --> 43:25.700\nThose serialized episodes\n\n43:25.700 --> 43:27.700\nWere pretty cheesy, pretty bad\n\n43:27.700 --> 43:29.700\nSo to find out next week\n\n43:29.700 --> 43:31.700\nWhether or not Gordon Jump actually is molesting Dudley\n\n43:31.700 --> 43:33.700\nRight, they were\n\n43:33.700 --> 43:35.700\nDeath rattles of desperate shows\n\n43:35.700 --> 43:37.700\nAnd it was sad to see\n\n43:37.700 --> 43:39.700\nPrevious shows that a few weeks earlier\n\n43:39.700 --> 43:41.700\nHad cultural efficacy\n\n43:41.700 --> 43:43.700\nAnd now you're watching them wheeze\n\n43:43.700 --> 43:45.700\nAnd cough and tell you to\n\n43:45.700 --> 43:47.700\nI remember\n\n43:47.700 --> 43:49.700\nDifferent strokes was like, man\n\n43:49.700 --> 43:51.700\nIt had a lot of death rattles\n\n43:51.700 --> 43:53.700\nThere was that molestation episode\n\n43:53.700 --> 43:55.700\nAnd then there was Dudley and\n\n43:55.700 --> 43:57.700\nDudley and Arnold both got\n\n43:57.700 --> 43:59.700\nLocked inside\n\n43:59.700 --> 44:01.700\nA car on the\n\n44:01.700 --> 44:03.700\nKnight Rider set\n\n44:03.700 --> 44:05.700\nThey were visiting Knight Rider\n\n44:05.700 --> 44:07.700\nBecause fuck it\n\n44:11.700 --> 44:13.700\nBecause someone was just looking out the window\n\n44:13.700 --> 44:15.700\nIn the different strokes Rider's room\n\n44:15.700 --> 44:17.700\nAnd then they looked at the clock\n\n44:17.700 --> 44:19.700\nAnd they were like, what if he went over there\n\n44:21.700 --> 44:23.700\nNBC Synergy\n\n44:23.700 --> 44:25.700\nHome by three productions\n\n44:29.700 --> 44:31.700\nBut they\n\n44:31.700 --> 44:33.700\nIt was so\n\n44:33.700 --> 44:35.700\nRidiculous because Arnold got\n\n44:35.700 --> 44:37.700\nHe visited Knight Rider\n\n44:37.700 --> 44:39.700\nTalked to Knight Rider\n\n44:39.700 --> 44:41.700\nI think they maintained within the fabric\n\n44:41.700 --> 44:43.700\nOf the show that Knight Rider is an actual\n\n44:43.700 --> 44:45.700\nTalking car\n\n44:45.700 --> 44:47.700\nI'm okay with that because it's like\n\n44:47.700 --> 44:49.700\nIt's canon\n\n44:49.700 --> 44:51.700\nDifferent strokes canon\n\n44:51.700 --> 44:53.700\nThen he goes into a car\n\n44:53.700 --> 44:55.700\nI don't think it was a kit\n\n44:55.700 --> 44:57.700\nIt was a different car\n\n44:57.700 --> 44:59.700\nAnd he gets locked in the car\n\n44:59.700 --> 45:01.700\nIt's not even possible\n\n45:01.700 --> 45:03.700\nAnd then two crew\n\n45:03.700 --> 45:05.700\nHands like walk up\n\n45:05.700 --> 45:07.700\nAnd go\n\n45:07.700 --> 45:09.700\nHey, should I move this car?\n\n45:09.700 --> 45:11.700\nNo, what are you crazy? That's the car we're going to blow up\n\n45:11.700 --> 45:13.700\nIn the next scene\n\n45:13.700 --> 45:15.700\nAnd the audience goes\n\n45:17.700 --> 45:19.700\nThey had the same reaction as they did to Dudley\n\n45:19.700 --> 45:21.700\nGetting molested\n\n45:21.700 --> 45:23.700\nOh, that's the car they're going to blow up\n\n45:23.700 --> 45:25.700\nThis is not how Hollywood works\n\n45:25.700 --> 45:27.700\nWhat is the Flintstones?\n\n45:27.700 --> 45:29.700\nAnyway, cars don't talk\n\n45:29.700 --> 45:31.700\nI'm Andy Rudy\n\n45:31.700 --> 45:33.700\nRemember\n\n45:33.700 --> 45:35.700\nThere was the sitcom template\n\n45:35.700 --> 45:37.700\nWhere someone got trapped in something\n\n45:37.700 --> 45:39.700\nAnd they were possibly going to die\n\n45:39.700 --> 45:41.700\nSo on Punky Brewster\n\n45:41.700 --> 45:43.700\nHer friend got caught stuck in the refrigerator\n\n45:43.700 --> 45:45.700\nOf course\n\n45:45.700 --> 45:47.700\nI remember the Threes Company episode\n\n45:47.700 --> 45:49.700\nWhere they were stuck in that freezer\n\n45:49.700 --> 45:51.700\nAnd they could have died\n\n45:51.700 --> 45:53.700\nIt was number 72\n\n45:53.700 --> 45:55.700\nOn the list of sitcom tropes\n\n45:55.700 --> 45:57.700\nIt was a simpler world\n\n45:57.700 --> 45:59.700\nThe Incredible Hulk won an Emmy\n\n45:59.700 --> 46:01.700\nFor Best Dramatic Series\n\n46:03.700 --> 46:05.700\nSimpler time\n\n46:05.700 --> 46:07.700\nI think Lindsay Wagner\n\n46:07.700 --> 46:09.700\nWas at her name\n\n46:09.700 --> 46:11.700\nI think she got an Emmy for Best Actress\n\n46:11.700 --> 46:13.700\nIn a dramatic series\n\n46:13.700 --> 46:15.700\nFor Bionic Woman\n\n46:15.700 --> 46:17.700\nAnyways\n\n46:19.700 --> 46:21.700\nDerejevel, what do you think?\n\n46:21.700 --> 46:23.700\nYeah\n\n46:23.700 --> 46:25.700\nI'm a fan\n\n46:25.700 --> 46:27.700\nAbsolutely\n\n46:27.700 --> 46:29.700\nI like that friend of his\n\n46:29.700 --> 46:31.700\nHe stopped after the pilot\n\n46:31.700 --> 46:33.700\nBecause of that friend of his\n\n46:33.700 --> 46:35.700\nWhat do you mean?\n\n46:35.700 --> 46:37.700\nHis friend just seems a little foggy\n\n46:37.700 --> 46:39.700\nYeah\n\n46:39.700 --> 46:41.700\nI was a little thrown by his performance style\n\n46:41.700 --> 46:43.700\nYeah\n\n46:43.700 --> 46:45.700\nI'm lowering my voice because\n\n46:45.700 --> 46:47.700\nBecause Marvel lawyers are listening\n\n46:47.700 --> 46:49.700\nNo, it's because\n\n46:49.700 --> 46:51.700\nI get the distinct impression\n\n46:51.700 --> 46:53.700\nHe's probably a fan\n\n46:57.700 --> 46:59.700\nJust because\n\n46:59.700 --> 47:01.700\nHe's acting a lot\n\n47:01.700 --> 47:03.700\nLike a guy wandering around Comic Con\n\n47:03.700 --> 47:05.700\nNot so much like a professional actor\n\n47:05.700 --> 47:07.700\nHe just kind of stumbled on set\n\n47:07.700 --> 47:09.700\nYeah\n\n47:09.700 --> 47:11.700\nHe's supposed to be the comic relief\n\n47:11.700 --> 47:13.700\nCall me your hair\n\n47:13.700 --> 47:15.700\nKnock it back\n\n47:15.700 --> 47:17.700\nBangs are flying all over the place\n\n47:17.700 --> 47:19.700\nI don't know\n\n47:19.700 --> 47:21.700\nI'm talking about him\n\n47:21.700 --> 47:23.700\nHe'll become your favorite character\n\n47:23.700 --> 47:25.700\nHe gets better and better\n\n47:25.700 --> 47:27.700\nFine\n\n47:27.700 --> 47:29.700\nI think of all the\n\n47:29.700 --> 47:31.700\ncomic book adaptations\n\n47:31.700 --> 47:33.700\nTo me, The Flash\n\n47:33.700 --> 47:35.700\nThey killed it in Season 1\n\n47:35.700 --> 47:37.700\nI haven't seen it\n\n47:37.700 --> 47:39.700\nThey did a really great job\n\n47:39.700 --> 47:41.700\nIt's a lot of fun\n\n47:41.700 --> 47:43.700\nIt's so accessible\n\n47:43.700 --> 47:45.700\nI watch it with my 5 year old\n\n47:45.700 --> 47:47.700\nI don't know if I'm dad of the year\n\n47:47.700 --> 47:49.700\nThere is some death on the show\n\n47:49.700 --> 47:51.700\nThere are times where I'm\n\n47:51.700 --> 47:53.700\nWondering if I'm\n\n47:53.700 --> 47:55.700\nInjuring this kid\n\n47:55.700 --> 47:57.700\nBut he enjoys it\n\n47:57.700 --> 47:59.700\nWhat are The Flash's\n\n47:59.700 --> 48:01.700\nLimitations\n\n48:01.700 --> 48:03.700\nThat seems like a pretty extreme\n\n48:03.700 --> 48:05.700\nSuper power to just be able to do\n\n48:05.700 --> 48:07.700\nEverything faster than everybody else\n\n48:07.700 --> 48:09.700\nThat's right next to\n\n48:09.700 --> 48:11.700\nFlying\n\n48:13.700 --> 48:15.700\nDo people just sometimes stick their arm out\n\n48:15.700 --> 48:17.700\nAnd wait\n\n48:17.700 --> 48:19.700\nAnd that's like his kryptonite\n\n48:19.700 --> 48:21.700\nIs it a patient close line\n\n48:21.700 --> 48:23.700\nThere's a lot of baddies out there\n\n48:23.700 --> 48:25.700\nThere's the reverse flash\n\n48:25.700 --> 48:27.700\nWhat does reverse flash do\n\n48:27.700 --> 48:29.700\nWhat does he do\n\n48:29.700 --> 48:31.700\nSame speed backwards\n\n48:31.700 --> 48:33.700\nOr super slow\n\n48:35.700 --> 48:37.700\nThat would be great\n\n48:37.700 --> 48:39.700\nThere was a flash\n\n48:39.700 --> 48:41.700\nThere's a flash villain\n\n48:41.700 --> 48:43.700\nIn the comic book world\n\n48:43.700 --> 48:45.700\nYou're a big fan of this character\n\n48:45.700 --> 48:47.700\nWhat was his name\n\n48:47.700 --> 48:49.700\nThe Turtle\n\n48:49.700 --> 48:51.700\nThe Tortoise\n\n48:51.700 --> 48:53.700\nHe was the world's slowest criminal\n\n48:53.700 --> 48:55.700\nI've only read the description\n\n48:55.700 --> 48:57.700\nI've never seen it in the comic book\n\n48:57.700 --> 48:59.700\nIt was like give me a break\n\n48:59.700 --> 49:01.700\nHe was a great nemesis to flash\n\n49:01.700 --> 49:03.700\nBecause as described\n\n49:03.700 --> 49:05.700\nHe's so slow\n\n49:05.700 --> 49:07.700\nThat flash\n\n49:07.700 --> 49:09.700\nWould get to the scene of the crime\n\n49:09.700 --> 49:11.700\nInvestigate it\n\n49:11.700 --> 49:13.700\nAnd leave before the turtle\n\n49:13.700 --> 49:15.700\nEver got there\n\n49:17.700 --> 49:19.700\nThat's pretty slow\n\n49:19.700 --> 49:21.700\nThat's actually\n\n49:21.700 --> 49:23.700\nHe's not a criminal at all\n\n49:23.700 --> 49:25.700\nThat's the time\n\n49:25.700 --> 49:27.700\nSpace continuum\n\n49:27.700 --> 49:29.700\nFlash's nemesis is just people who haven't done anything yet\n\n49:29.700 --> 49:31.700\nThat's not\n\n49:31.700 --> 49:33.700\nHe's just an impatient guy\n\n49:33.700 --> 49:35.700\nThat's person of interest\n\n49:35.700 --> 49:37.700\nSeriously what is reverse flash\n\n49:37.700 --> 49:39.700\nWhat does that mean to be a reverse flash\n\n49:39.700 --> 49:41.700\nThe character\n\n49:41.700 --> 49:43.700\nThe guy from Ed\n\n49:43.700 --> 49:45.700\nWhose name is escaping me right now\n\n49:45.700 --> 49:47.700\nTom Kavanaugh\n\n49:47.700 --> 49:49.700\nAre we giving away spoilers by the way\n\n49:49.700 --> 49:51.700\nBecause I'm realizing\n\n49:51.700 --> 49:53.700\nI know exactly\n\n49:53.700 --> 49:55.700\nSpoiler alert\n\n49:55.700 --> 49:57.700\nThe first season hinges on reverse flash\n\n49:57.700 --> 49:59.700\nAnd what he is\n\n49:59.700 --> 50:01.700\nFine\n\n50:01.700 --> 50:07.700\nSo what are white walkers\n\n50:07.700 --> 50:09.700\nHow do they work\n\n50:09.700 --> 50:11.700\nAnd how do you kill them\n\n50:11.700 --> 50:13.700\nHow are you feeling\n\n50:13.700 --> 50:15.700\nAbout Game of Thrones right now\n\n50:15.700 --> 50:17.700\nI'm behind right now\n\n50:17.700 --> 50:19.700\nAnd we're missing tonight too\n\n50:19.700 --> 50:21.700\nA couple episodes behind\n\n50:21.700 --> 50:23.700\nThere's been some controversy about Game of Thrones\n\n50:23.700 --> 50:25.700\nI guess it's just inevitable\n\n50:25.700 --> 50:27.700\nThe show was so flawless for so long\n\n50:27.700 --> 50:29.700\nAnd everybody's eyes\n\n50:29.700 --> 50:31.700\nThere's like two lobes\n\n50:31.700 --> 50:33.700\nTo the controversy as far as I can understand it\n\n50:33.700 --> 50:35.700\nOne is\n\n50:35.700 --> 50:37.700\nThat they're starting\n\n50:37.700 --> 50:39.700\nThey're departing from the books\n\n50:39.700 --> 50:41.700\nMore and more\n\n50:41.700 --> 50:43.700\nI don't know if it's accurate to say more and more\n\n50:43.700 --> 50:45.700\nBut I thought I heard something that their plan\n\n50:45.700 --> 50:47.700\nWas to actually depart from them\n\n50:47.700 --> 50:49.700\nTo an extent that it would be okay to just coexist\n\n50:49.700 --> 50:51.700\nYeah and you kind of have to at some point\n\n50:51.700 --> 50:53.700\nBut I'm curious what you guys think\n\n50:53.700 --> 50:55.700\nAre you guys cool with them going in a different direction\n\n50:55.700 --> 50:57.700\nThan the books\n\n50:57.700 --> 50:59.700\nThey're almost caught up to the books anyway right\n\n50:59.700 --> 51:01.700\nSo wouldn't they have to\n\n51:01.700 --> 51:03.700\nRight I mean that's the thing too\n\n51:03.700 --> 51:05.700\nHe's racing to finish the next book\n\n51:05.700 --> 51:07.700\nBut then you know at some point\n\n51:07.700 --> 51:09.700\nAll these shows have to go in their own direction\n\n51:09.700 --> 51:11.700\nI mean that's the thing about Walking Dead as well\n\n51:11.700 --> 51:13.700\nIs that the treat is\n\n51:13.700 --> 51:15.700\nThey do sort of honor the comics\n\n51:15.700 --> 51:17.700\nBut at the same time they've gone in a different direction\n\n51:17.700 --> 51:19.700\nThey've created new characters\n\n51:19.700 --> 51:21.700\nThey've sort of taken things from the comics\n\n51:21.700 --> 51:23.700\nAnd sort of switched them around\n\n51:23.700 --> 51:25.700\nChanged the timetable\n\n51:25.700 --> 51:27.700\nIt's enjoyable for both\n\n51:27.700 --> 51:29.700\nIt's an opportunity to have two different sort of\n\n51:29.700 --> 51:31.700\nPaths for that\n\n51:31.700 --> 51:33.700\nYou know that genre\n\n51:33.700 --> 51:35.700\nYeah the other lobe of the controversy\n\n51:35.700 --> 51:37.700\nWas a really specific thing of like the brutality\n\n51:37.700 --> 51:39.700\nOf the which and I think\n\n51:39.700 --> 51:41.700\nI think the reason why it was so controversial\n\n51:41.700 --> 51:43.700\nIs because also it wasn't\n\n51:43.700 --> 51:45.700\nIn the books so that's kind of the definition\n\n51:45.700 --> 51:47.700\nOf gratuitous\n\n51:47.700 --> 51:49.700\nWas Sansa's wedding night\n\n51:49.700 --> 51:51.700\nWas in this like her third wedding night\n\n51:51.700 --> 51:53.700\nSansa hasn't had\n\n51:53.700 --> 51:55.700\nA good life\n\n51:55.700 --> 51:57.700\nAnd so\n\n51:57.700 --> 51:59.700\nThere was her wedding night to\n\n51:59.700 --> 52:01.700\nShitbag\n\n52:01.700 --> 52:03.700\nYeah Ramsey\n\n52:03.700 --> 52:05.700\nCool name, bad guy\n\n52:05.700 --> 52:07.700\nShe you know he\n\n52:07.700 --> 52:09.700\nWhatever but if you don't know\n\n52:09.700 --> 52:11.700\nIt doesn't matter it's a brutal\n\n52:11.700 --> 52:13.700\nIt's not a great consensual\n\n52:13.700 --> 52:15.700\nKind of wedding night\n\n52:15.700 --> 52:17.700\nAnd now so\n\n52:17.700 --> 52:19.700\nCinematically as far as what happens\n\n52:19.700 --> 52:21.700\nOn the screen it's actually one of the least\n\n52:21.700 --> 52:23.700\nGratuitous things in the Game of Thrones history\n\n52:23.700 --> 52:25.700\nThere's a shot of him ripping up in the back of her dress\n\n52:25.700 --> 52:27.700\nAnd then the rest is played on her\n\n52:27.700 --> 52:29.700\nTerrified face which is all the more brutal\n\n52:29.700 --> 52:31.700\nAnd also\n\n52:31.700 --> 52:33.700\nIt's like yeah it's like the rest of the show\n\n52:33.700 --> 52:35.700\nIs just like actual reverse cowgirl action\n\n52:35.700 --> 52:37.700\nAnd people everyone you know one can\n\n52:37.700 --> 52:39.700\nActually ever have sex in Game of Thrones\n\n52:39.700 --> 52:41.700\nEveryone someone's always walking in\n\n52:41.700 --> 52:43.700\nUm\n\n52:43.700 --> 52:45.700\nBut I\n\n52:45.700 --> 52:47.700\nSo I\n\n52:47.700 --> 52:49.700\nI was like okay so it wasn't in the book\n\n52:49.700 --> 52:51.700\nOkay and then there's a lot of argument\n\n52:51.700 --> 52:53.700\nOf like well we already knew Ramsey was bad\n\n52:53.700 --> 52:55.700\nWhy are we doing this\n\n52:55.700 --> 52:57.700\nAnd you certainly don't want to dance near the\n\n52:57.700 --> 52:59.700\nHot button of like the emerging\n\n52:59.700 --> 53:01.700\nFeminism and stuff and I don't want to take that stuff lightly\n\n53:01.700 --> 53:03.700\nOr dismiss it for dumb reasons\n\n53:03.700 --> 53:05.700\nBut I will say\n\n53:05.700 --> 53:07.700\nI feel like the whole Game of Thrones series\n\n53:07.700 --> 53:09.700\nNot being not a guy\n\n53:09.700 --> 53:11.700\nThat read the books like when I watch the show\n\n53:11.700 --> 53:13.700\nI feel like those two sisters\n\n53:13.700 --> 53:15.700\nArya and Sansa\n\n53:15.700 --> 53:17.700\nThat the whole series is like\n\n53:17.700 --> 53:19.700\nIt's this like to me\n\n53:19.700 --> 53:21.700\nThe whole point of that show\n\n53:21.700 --> 53:23.700\nIs that I'm waiting for the two of them\n\n53:23.700 --> 53:25.700\nTo enter the same room again\n\n53:25.700 --> 53:27.700\nAfter all these years because one of them\n\n53:27.700 --> 53:29.700\nIn the beginning of the show\n\n53:29.700 --> 53:31.700\nIs just a standard like oh I'm\n\n53:31.700 --> 53:33.700\nThe princess archetype and my value\n\n53:33.700 --> 53:35.700\nIs in learning to sew and I'm going to get married off\n\n53:35.700 --> 53:37.700\nAnd I'm a diplomat and I'm going to learn how to\n\n53:37.700 --> 53:39.700\nHow to consolidate power from my family\n\n53:39.700 --> 53:41.700\nBecause I'm pretty and blah blah blah\n\n53:41.700 --> 53:43.700\nAnd then the other girl is like I want to shoot arrows\n\n53:43.700 --> 53:45.700\nYou're not allowed to shoot arrows and it's like okay\n\n53:45.700 --> 53:47.700\nWe resonate with them\n\n53:47.700 --> 53:49.700\nAnd then the shit just hits the fan\n\n53:49.700 --> 53:51.700\nAnd these two girls in particular\n\n53:51.700 --> 53:53.700\nThey're separated and now we're just\n\n53:53.700 --> 53:55.700\nWatching them like Arya has now become\n\n53:55.700 --> 53:57.700\nLike this weird ninja assassin\n\n53:57.700 --> 53:59.700\nThat's like learning how to like bender\n\n53:59.700 --> 54:01.700\nMind so she can poison people or whatever\n\n54:01.700 --> 54:03.700\nAnd like and Sansa is\n\n54:03.700 --> 54:05.700\nLike is no less\n\n54:05.700 --> 54:07.700\nA hero and by virtue\n\n54:07.700 --> 54:09.700\nOf the tragedy that's befalling her\n\n54:09.700 --> 54:11.700\nIt's like it's two it's like the darkest\n\n54:11.700 --> 54:13.700\nVersions of their little fantasies\n\n54:13.700 --> 54:15.700\nWe were watching them before their lives\n\n54:15.700 --> 54:17.700\nWent to hell and so\n\n54:17.700 --> 54:19.700\nFor that one reason\n\n54:19.700 --> 54:21.700\nI was like well you know what\n\n54:21.700 --> 54:23.700\nThe more bad shit that happens to Sansa\n\n54:23.700 --> 54:25.700\nThe better like maybe\n\n54:25.700 --> 54:27.700\nThat's the point or I don't know\n\n54:29.700 --> 54:31.700\nI think the thing is\n\n54:31.700 --> 54:33.700\nYou're right it's a very delicate\n\n54:33.700 --> 54:35.700\nTopic especially right now\n\n54:35.700 --> 54:37.700\nIn society and in the world and you\n\n54:37.700 --> 54:39.700\nHave to be prepared to\n\n54:39.700 --> 54:41.700\nEither justify it or\n\n54:41.700 --> 54:43.700\nBe sort of cognizant\n\n54:43.700 --> 54:45.700\nThat this is going to create a controversy\n\n54:45.700 --> 54:47.700\nAnd you better have\n\n54:47.700 --> 54:49.700\nSort of your explanation ready\n\n54:49.700 --> 54:51.700\nYou better be ready to sort of explain it\n\n54:51.700 --> 54:53.700\nAnd sometimes I'm surprised\n\n54:53.700 --> 54:55.700\nWhen networks or producers are caught off guard\n\n54:55.700 --> 54:57.700\nBy controversy when you can\n\n54:57.700 --> 54:59.700\nSort of see it a mile away\n\n54:59.700 --> 55:01.700\nAnd in this age of social media\n\n55:01.700 --> 55:03.700\nAnything can become a controversy\n\n55:03.700 --> 55:05.700\nSo you always have to be ready to\n\n55:05.700 --> 55:07.700\nExplain yourself and\n\n55:07.700 --> 55:09.700\nJustify the direction\n\n55:09.700 --> 55:11.700\nYou want to show so that's where\n\n55:11.700 --> 55:13.700\nI kind of sort of still don't understand\n\n55:13.700 --> 55:15.700\nIs when people aren't ready to\n\n55:15.700 --> 55:17.700\nHave they had a response\n\n55:17.700 --> 55:19.700\nHas there been a response from the production side\n\n55:19.700 --> 55:21.700\nTo the controversy? Has anyone issued a statement\n\n55:21.700 --> 55:23.700\nSaying like look here's\n\n55:23.700 --> 55:25.700\nLeave us alone we're Game of Thrones or anything\n\n55:25.700 --> 55:27.700\nHave they said anything?\n\n55:27.700 --> 55:29.700\nThey've come out and said\n\n55:29.700 --> 55:31.700\nWe apologize if we have offended\n\n55:31.700 --> 55:33.700\nPeople that wasn't\n\n55:33.700 --> 55:35.700\nThe purpose of the storyline\n\n55:35.700 --> 55:37.700\nSort of the usual sort of explanation\n\n55:37.700 --> 55:39.700\nAnd so\n\n55:39.700 --> 55:41.700\nYou know they're big\n\n55:41.700 --> 55:43.700\nYou know so\n\n55:43.700 --> 55:45.700\nI have a question\n\n55:45.700 --> 55:47.700\nI thought\n\n55:47.700 --> 55:49.700\nThank you Curtis\n\n55:49.700 --> 55:51.700\nWell I was just wondering something\n\n55:51.700 --> 55:53.700\nBecause I might be wrong because I'm\n\n55:53.700 --> 55:55.700\nWay behind I'm still in the books\n\n55:55.700 --> 55:57.700\nBut\n\n55:57.700 --> 55:59.700\nMy question is\n\n55:59.700 --> 56:01.700\nMy question is that the problem\n\n56:01.700 --> 56:03.700\nWith this particular case\n\n56:03.700 --> 56:05.700\nWas that it actually\n\n56:05.700 --> 56:07.700\nInstantly corrected\n\n56:07.700 --> 56:09.700\nThat it was something that in the books\n\n56:09.700 --> 56:11.700\nDid not happen to that character\n\n56:11.700 --> 56:13.700\nIt was something that was imposed\n\n56:13.700 --> 56:15.700\nOn the character is that correct\n\n56:15.700 --> 56:17.700\nSo that was the reason\n\n56:17.700 --> 56:19.700\nFor the controversy it wasn't the fact\n\n56:19.700 --> 56:21.700\nThat it was a rape or how\n\n56:21.700 --> 56:23.700\nVisually brutal it was\n\n56:23.700 --> 56:25.700\nIt was that they arbitrarily\n\n56:25.700 --> 56:27.700\nTook another character and gave\n\n56:27.700 --> 56:29.700\nThe rape to this character\n\n56:29.700 --> 56:31.700\nYeah I think it was all the above\n\n56:31.700 --> 56:33.700\nThat it was sort of just you know\n\n56:33.700 --> 56:35.700\nThe form of this was going to incite\n\n56:35.700 --> 56:37.700\nSome concern out there and on social\n\n56:37.700 --> 56:39.700\nMedia especially you know this is\n\n56:39.700 --> 56:41.700\nAn age of social media as you know Dan\n\n56:41.700 --> 56:43.700\nThat you know and that's\n\n56:43.700 --> 56:45.700\nActually it's weird you know it's like\n\n56:45.700 --> 56:47.700\nWith Sopranos, Deadwood, Game of Thrones\n\n56:47.700 --> 56:49.700\nI mean\n\n56:49.700 --> 56:51.700\nI'm not defending anything\n\n56:51.700 --> 56:53.700\nBut the word\n\n56:53.700 --> 56:55.700\nFor the other side is that it's like come on\n\n56:55.700 --> 56:57.700\nWhat are we getting high on when we're watching\n\n56:57.700 --> 56:59.700\nThese shows it's like\n\n56:59.700 --> 57:01.700\nYou know there's a point when\n\n57:01.700 --> 57:03.700\nLike it looks like\n\n57:03.700 --> 57:05.700\nI'm trying to avoid spoilers so I'm just\n\n57:05.700 --> 57:07.700\nSpeaking of very general things but there's a\n\n57:07.700 --> 57:09.700\nPoint when it looks like\n\n57:09.700 --> 57:11.700\nPeter Dinklage might die\n\n57:11.700 --> 57:13.700\nAnd that's not a spoiler it's just\n\n57:13.700 --> 57:15.700\nLike he's in a tough physical spot\n\n57:15.700 --> 57:17.700\nAnd I found myself going like you know what\n\n57:17.700 --> 57:19.700\nThis could be it and that's\n\n57:19.700 --> 57:21.700\nWhat makes that show so amazing that's what made\n\n57:21.700 --> 57:23.700\nBreaking Bad really interesting it's like\n\n57:23.700 --> 57:25.700\nThe brutality and the randomness\n\n57:25.700 --> 57:27.700\nThe chaos it's like\n\n57:27.700 --> 57:29.700\nHoly shit like I don't know\n\n57:29.700 --> 57:31.700\nThat shows first season ends in one of\n\n57:31.700 --> 57:33.700\nThe biggest like\n\n57:33.700 --> 57:35.700\nWhat the fucks in TV\n\n57:35.700 --> 57:37.700\nHistory because you're like what\n\n57:37.700 --> 57:39.700\nHe was Michael Thrones\n\n57:43.700 --> 57:45.700\nYou killed Michael Thrones\n\n57:45.700 --> 57:47.700\nIt's his game\n\n57:47.700 --> 57:49.700\nCersei\n\n57:49.700 --> 57:51.700\nLiterally five minutes earlier told him\n\n57:51.700 --> 57:53.700\nTo give him the Game of Thrones speech\n\n57:53.700 --> 57:55.700\nRemember she's like if you're going to play this\n\n57:55.700 --> 57:57.700\nGame of Thrones I suggest you be very\n\n57:57.700 --> 57:59.700\nCareful and he's like okay I will be\n\n57:59.700 --> 58:01.700\nCareful skunk\n\n58:01.700 --> 58:03.700\nAnd we were like holy shit\n\n58:03.700 --> 58:05.700\nAnd we were like you know we're tearing\n\n58:05.700 --> 58:07.700\nIn our shirts and we're like freaking out\n\n58:07.700 --> 58:09.700\nAnd then we just like sacked Aaron waited\n\n58:09.700 --> 58:11.700\nFor the next season because we're like holy shit\n\n58:11.700 --> 58:13.700\nAnd it's happened a thousand times in that\n\n58:13.700 --> 58:15.700\nShow since then and so\n\n58:15.700 --> 58:17.700\nThat's the only I'm neither\n\n58:17.700 --> 58:19.700\nDefending nor\n\n58:19.700 --> 58:21.700\nNor attacking because of the\n\n58:21.700 --> 58:23.700\nSensitivity of the issue and it's like\n\n58:23.700 --> 58:25.700\nI don't want to mansplain\n\n58:25.700 --> 58:27.700\nAbout any of that stuff\n\n58:27.700 --> 58:29.700\nI don't want to stay on the TV\n\n58:29.700 --> 58:31.700\nLike consumer side of this\n\n58:31.700 --> 58:33.700\nThing and none of my business on the\n\n58:33.700 --> 58:35.700\nGender side\n\n58:35.700 --> 58:37.700\nBut that's the other thing to consider\n\n58:37.700 --> 58:39.700\nIs just like you know the fucking\n\n58:39.700 --> 58:41.700\nLike brutality\n\n58:41.700 --> 58:43.700\nWe can't\n\n58:43.700 --> 58:45.700\nBecause the argument I keep hearing is like\n\n58:45.700 --> 58:47.700\nCome on give me a break we already knew that guy was a bad guy\n\n58:47.700 --> 58:49.700\nI'm like well that's come on\n\n58:49.700 --> 58:51.700\nBy that argument\n\n58:51.700 --> 58:53.700\nOscar the Grouch is as bad as it should get\n\n58:53.700 --> 58:55.700\nBecause he's like\n\n58:55.700 --> 58:57.700\nIf you want to freak\n\n58:57.700 --> 58:59.700\nPeople out Oscar's got a like\n\n58:59.700 --> 59:01.700\nLunge at Big Bridge throat and everyone's like\n\n59:01.700 --> 59:03.700\nI'll be like I fucking hate birds\n\n59:03.700 --> 59:05.700\nBecause I'm racist\n\n59:05.700 --> 59:07.700\nJust blood everywhere\n\n59:07.700 --> 59:09.700\nA series finale of Sesame Street\n\n59:09.700 --> 59:11.700\nFade to black\n\n59:13.700 --> 59:15.700\nWhy don't we bring out media correspondent\n\n59:15.700 --> 59:27.700\nSpencer Crittenden\n\n59:27.700 --> 59:29.700\nIs that\n\n59:29.700 --> 59:31.700\nI walked in with a bag\n\n59:31.700 --> 59:33.700\nI brought a paper bag it says Hannah on it\n\n59:33.700 --> 59:35.700\nIn Sharpie\n\n59:35.700 --> 59:37.700\nIt's not an emergency is Hannah here\n\n59:37.700 --> 59:39.700\nOkay there's Hannah\n\n59:39.700 --> 59:41.700\nErin packed a little bag for her\n\n59:41.700 --> 59:43.700\nOkay good\n\n59:43.700 --> 59:45.700\nI thought I'd use Spencer's sit down time\n\n59:45.700 --> 59:47.700\nIs that it does it say Hannah on it\n\n59:47.700 --> 59:49.700\nThis is below your pay grade\n\n59:49.700 --> 59:51.700\nYou're a comptroller\n\n59:51.700 --> 59:53.700\nBut you can hand it off\n\n59:53.700 --> 59:55.700\nThere it goes to Marissa\n\n59:55.700 --> 59:57.700\nWe have like a whole congregation I know people's names\n\n59:57.700 --> 59:59.700\nOh that's for Erin\n\n59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.700\nThat's the backpack\n\n01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.700\nIs that just a drug deal that happened\n\n01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.700\nI had this idea where you could sell cocaine\n\n01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.700\nOut of a bowling alley\n\n01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.700\nBy putting it in the shoes\n\n01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.700\nAnd this is very similar\n\n01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.700\nTo that whole methodology\n\n01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.700\nWhat TV shows are you watching Spencer\n\n01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.700\nOh you know\n\n01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.700\nI don't know\n\n01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.700\nI just started watching Silicon Valley\n\n01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.700\nI just got caught up\n\n01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.700\nYeah Game of Thrones\n\n01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.700\nOkay\n\n01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.700\nNot spoilers\n\n01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.700\nIt's been said that obsidian can kill\n\n01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.700\nThose white walkers\n\n01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.700\nAnd they've revealed arrowheads made of obsidian\n\n01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.700\nAnd spoiler alert\n\n01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.700\nSometimes the white walkers\n\n01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.700\nWatch things they just stand there\n\n01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.700\nWatching stuff happening\n\n01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.700\nWhy can't they just shoot them in the fucking face\n\n01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.700\nWith obsidian arrows\n\n01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:01.700\nIt'd be done it'd be over\n\n01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.700\nNo more game\n\n01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.700\nYou mean like the\n\n01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.700\nLeaders\n\n01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.700\nThey just stand there\n\n01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.700\nAssholes\n\n01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.700\nI don't know\n\n01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.700\nWhen I saw those obsidian arrowheads\n\n01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.700\nI was like what the fuck are you idiots doing\n\n01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.700\nIf you didn't show the arrowheads\n\n01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.700\nI wouldn't have this question in my brain\n\n01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.700\nOkay sorry\n\n01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.700\nI know but I mean there's only a limited\n\n01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.700\nSupply of white walkers\n\n01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.700\nThere's not infinite of them\n\n01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.700\nYou could just four arrows done\n\n01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.700\nYeah\n\n01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.700\nOkay sorry everybody\n\n01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.700\nAll I've been thinking about you guys\n\n01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.700\nIs just\n\n01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.700\nJust Minecraft\n\n01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.700\nJust Minecraft Blood Magic\n\n01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.700\nAlright shit, alright\n\n01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.700\nWell it's 9-11\n\n01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.700\nYay\n\n01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.700\nIt's always off putting to the new guests\n\n01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.700\nIt's just 9-11\n\n01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.700\nAnd there is no hidden layer to it\n\n01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.700\nThey cheer at 9-11 because we've trained them too\n\n01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.700\nAnd\n\n01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.700\nThe goal is just to be bad people\n\n01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:07.700\nLike\n\n01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.700\nAlright so\n\n01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.700\nGolden Age of TV\n\n01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.700\nBut Silicon Valley by the way\n\n01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.700\nHaving a great second season\n\n01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.700\nI'm way behind on that\n\n01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.700\nI haven't watched since the finale of the first one\n\n01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.700\nIt's good man\n\n01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.700\nI'm kind of scared\n\n01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:25.700\nI need to hear that before I dive in\n\n01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.700\nBecause like Kumil is a very good friend of the show\n\n01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.700\nAnd it's like if I have like a\n\n01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.700\nWhat if I hate it\n\n01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.700\nI mean not hate, like his parts are better this season\n\n01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.700\nI think\n\n01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.700\nHe's always perfect\n\n01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.700\nCome back Kumil\n\n01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.700\nAnd Dreamy\n\n01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.700\nWhat are you guys thinking about this season\n\n01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.700\nOf Orphan Black\n\n01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.700\nBoo\n\n01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.700\nOh my god I love that\n\n01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.700\nYou love Orphan Black\n\n01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.700\nI love Orphan Black\n\n01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.700\nIt's a great show\n\n01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.700\nIt's really getting into the weeds though\n\n01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.700\nSo I feel like\n\n01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.700\nThe last not this past Saturday's episode\n\n01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.700\nBut the week before\n\n01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.700\nI felt like they were getting back on track\n\n01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.700\nSo fingers crossed\n\n01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.700\nI'm in it for good\n\n01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.700\nI feel like maybe now\n\n01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.700\nThey're getting back on track\n\n01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.700\nThere wasn't enough Alice in this season\n\n01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.700\nOh no but you know what\n\n01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.700\nThey've got more Helena\n\n01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.700\nAnd Helena is now my favorite\n\n01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.700\nOh my god I love her so much\n\n01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:29.700\nI love Tatiana Maslany\n\n01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.700\nI'm sorry but I love Tatiana Maslany\n\n01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.700\nI get\n\n01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.700\nI think it's good with olive oil\n\n01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.700\nJust a little salt\n\n01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:41.700\nTatiana Mosalini\n\n01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.700\nFor the whole table\n\n01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.700\nSo are you married\n\n01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.700\nSchneidi? Yes\n\n01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:53.700\nTo a lady? Yes\n\n01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.700\nSee how modern I am\n\n01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.700\nLook at you\n\n01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.700\nSpeaking of gay marriage\n\n01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.700\nI thought of one more reason to support it\n\n01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.700\nWhile I was getting dressed\n\n01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.700\nA couple days ago\n\n01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.700\n80% of all straight marriages\n\n01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.700\nAre gross people\n\n01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.700\nAnd all gay marriages\n\n01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.700\nAre adorable\n\n01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.700\nI've never seen a gay couple\n\n01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.700\nAnd I'm not talking about\n\n01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:27.700\nBecause they're good looking people\n\n01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.700\nI've never seen a gay couple\n\n01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.700\nAnd gone like those two are\n\n01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.700\nThose two suck\n\n01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.700\nBut I all constantly\n\n01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.700\nUniversal city walk\n\n01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.700\nIs just a parade of shit bags\n\n01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:41.700\nAnd they're all straight married couples\n\n01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:43.700\nI mean what are we protecting\n\n01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.700\nAlright anyways\n\n01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:47.700\nThat was my culture segment\n\n01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.700\nI think that's a big city walk issue\n\n01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.700\nLike did you see that\n\n01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:53.700\nDocumentary with George Decay\n\n01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.700\nGeorge Decay and his husband\n\n01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.700\nThey're goddamn adorable\n\n01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.700\nIs that condescending to say\n\n01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.700\nIs that a new form of homophobia\n\n01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.700\nIs that infantilizing them?\n\n01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.700\nGeorge Decay is the best though\n\n01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.700\nI'm not saying they're adorable\n\n01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.700\nAs human beings to dehumanize\n\n01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.700\nI'm saying their marriage is adorable\n\n01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.700\nHe's adorable\n\n01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:23.700\nSo when you come home to your wife\n\n01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.700\nAnd she's like\n\n01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:27.700\nI was going to endow her\n\n01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.700\nAs like washing dishes\n\n01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.700\nBut then I started spiraling into\n\n01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.700\nFeminist reaction\n\n01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.700\nBut I'm saying she finished her job\n\n01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:37.700\nAs like a powerful attorney\n\n01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.700\nAnd she's just\n\n01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.700\nA little bit of protein on a plate\n\n01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.700\nCleaning her own plate\n\n01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:45.700\nThat's what you guys do\n\n01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.700\nShe's a graphic designer\n\n01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:49.700\nShe's washing a dish\n\n01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.700\nAnd she's not good at it\n\n01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.700\nShe's like\n\n01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.700\nFuck\n\n01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.700\nFuck\n\n01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.700\nAnd\n\n01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.700\nI just wanted to put her in a position\n\n01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.700\nWhere you guys are a sweet married couple\n\n01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.700\nAnd you're coming up behind her\n\n01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.700\nLike you're going to what tonight\n\n01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.700\nDan Harmon\n\n01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:13.700\nWhat is that?\n\n01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.700\nDo you ever come up behind her\n\n01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.700\nAnd put your hands over her eyes\n\n01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.700\nAnd then\n\n01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.700\nSweetly whisper in her ear\n\n01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:23.700\nIs your schnity sense tingling?\n\n01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.700\nAs coined by Dan Harmon\n\n01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.700\nI really want to make this happen\n\n01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.700\nIt's funny\n\n01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.700\nYou tweeted that out to me\n\n01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.700\nBut then there were Michael Schneiders\n\n01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.700\nActually tweeted back at you\n\n01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.700\nAnd thanking you I guess\n\n01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.700\nIt was\n\n01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.700\nThe schnity sense\n\n01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.700\nI think it's how you should open all of your columns\n\n01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.700\nAnything that you write you should say\n\n01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.700\nHey is your schnity sense tingling\n\n01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:55.700\nWhatever panel I moderate\n\n01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.700\nFrom here on out at Comic Con\n\n01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.700\nThat's all\n\n01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.700\nHey is your schnity sense tingling\n\n01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.700\nHey it's me Mike Schneider\n\n01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.700\nAnother rape on Game of Thrones last night\n\n01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.700\nAnd the fans are a buzz\n\n01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:09.700\nStay tuned\n\n01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:13.700\nAlright\n\n01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.700\nI was actually bringing up your wife\n\n01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.700\nBecause I was just curious\n\n01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.700\nShe's a graphic designer\n\n01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.700\nI'm assuming she's kind of a TV buff\n\n01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.700\nOr maybe not I don't know\n\n01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.700\nWe watch a lot of TV together\n\n01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.700\nBut the problem is we fall asleep in front of the TV at different times\n\n01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.700\nSo then we can't actually ever delete anything on the DVR\n\n01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.700\nBecause I got to watch\n\n01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.700\nAll that episode she didn't\n\n01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.700\nThere was something I didn't\n\n01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.700\nAnd so we were never\n\n01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.700\nActually deleting anything\n\n01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.700\nI don't have a point to that story\n\n01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.700\nIt's just reality folks\n\n01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.700\nAre you a positive TV viewer\n\n01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.700\nLike when you're watching are you always\n\n01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.700\nYou don't seem like a very judgmental\n\n01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:51.700\nI'm not a critic so that helps\n\n01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.700\nI don't have to critique shows\n\n01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.700\nBut you don't watch it through that lens\n\n01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.700\nOf like grumble grumble grumble\n\n01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:59.700\nOr snarky snarky snarky snark\n\n01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.700\nNo for the most part not\n\n01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:03.700\nIf I had a bad run in with someone\n\n01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.700\nThen it kind of\n\n01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.700\nIt does maybe cloud a little

ago\n\n01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:03.700\nThey said that Saget was on board\n\n01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:05.700\nBut he's been on board from the beginning\n\n01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.700\nI should know that more than anybody\n\n01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:09.700\nWe're always taping our third episode\n\n01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.700\nWhen Allison Breeze contract closes\n\n01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.700\nIt's always like\n\n01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:15.700\nAre we going to be able to air this?\n\n01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.700\nDifferent people need\n\n01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:19.700\nDifferent amounts of time to scare me\n\n01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:25.700\nWill you stay and play Shadowrun?\n\n01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.700\nNo, it's probably your favorite part of the podcast\n\n01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.700\nShould I?\n\n01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:33.700\nI would like you to\n\n01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.700\nI like it when our guests do it\n\n01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.700\nCurtis was a newcomer\n\n01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.700\nI was once new\n\n01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:41.700\nYou like playing Shadowrun\n\n01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:43.700\nNow I'm so experienced\n\n01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.700\nI'm almost cynical about the whole thing\n\n01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.700\nYou're going to phone it in tonight?\n\n01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.700\nYeah, probably\n\n01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:55.700\nIs that as a kid?\n\n01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:57.700\nOh, a long time ago\n\n01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.700\nYou got your character sheet\n\n01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.700\nIt's got a bunch of nonsense on it\n\n01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.700\nSorry, Spencer\n\n01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.700\nIt's like\n\n01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:07.700\nWe're all drunk\n\n01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.700\nI'm going to mess this up horribly\n\n01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.700\nYeah, yeah\n\n01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.700\nBut primarily it's just improvised storytelling\n\n01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:15.700\nAnd a turn-based format\n\n01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.700\nWith Spencer is the only one\n\n01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.700\nCan actually say what happens\n\n01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.700\nBut the rest of us\n\n01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.700\nShadowrun can say what we want\n\n01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.700\nTo try to do\n\n01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.700\nIt's probably a pretty good explanation\n\n01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.700\nSo\n\n01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.700\nDo we\n\n01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:35.700\nWe got a doctor\n\n01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:37.700\nYou're playing the doctor, right?\n\n01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.700\nI guess I am, but you went on to another story\n\n01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:41.700\nI don't know if Dr. Friend is still in the story\n\n01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.700\nOh, he's there\n\n01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.700\nHe was instrumental\n\n01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:47.700\nYou don't cut Cowboy out of Midnight Cowboy\n\n01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.700\nAnd\n\n01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.700\nMorges, of course\n\n01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.700\nAnd\n\n01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:55.700\nI wonder if we should just have\n\n01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:57.700\nSchneider play Mercy O'Donnell\n\n01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.700\nOr\n\n01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:01.700\nI know, I had a little\n\n01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:03.700\nI had a discussion, because Erin\n\n01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:05.700\nTexted me during the show sometimes\n\n01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.700\nWhen she's not doing it, she's going to watch it live\n\n01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.700\nAnd\n\n01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.700\nI don't know, she's like\n\n01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:15.700\nYou always have a girl come up to play\n\n01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:17.700\nMercy, and then we got in one of those conversations\n\n01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:19.700\nEvery point of view is like\n\n01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.700\nYeah, but\n\n01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.700\nWe don't have a lot of\n\n01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.700\nWomen up here, and then it's like\n\n01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.700\nIt's not because only a woman can play the character\n\n01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.700\nIt's just because they make up half the\n\n01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.700\nPlanet, and then we don't\n\n01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.700\nHave any up here, and then there's a character\n\n01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.700\nThat's a lady\n\n01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.700\nGod, it's hard to be a white knight these days\n\n01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.700\nThat's what I've learned\n\n01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.700\nThat's the phrase for what I do\n\n01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.700\nI'm always white knighting, that's my thing\n\n01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:49.700\nWhite knighting, man\n\n01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:51.700\nBut it's not the\n\n01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.700\nDoing it to get laid thing\n\n01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.700\nI'm just doing it to try\n\n01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:57.700\nTo trick people into liking me\n\n01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:59.700\nLike, give these women a break, man, I'm a big hero\n\n01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.700\nI think that's usually\n\n01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:03.700\nWhy people do it, I don't think the\n\n01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.700\nYou know, those gallant nerds are trying to get laid\n\n01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.700\nThey're just trying to do what they think\n\n01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.700\nI mean, make people like them\n\n01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.700\nIf we're going to eliminate that\n\n01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:13.700\nAs a\n\n01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.700\nIf trying to make people like you\n\n01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:17.700\nIsn't a good reason to\n\n01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.700\nNot be racist or sexist or anything\n\n01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:21.700\nI might have to just give up\n\n01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:23.700\nI don't know what else\n\n01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:25.700\nIs in it for me anymore\n\n01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.700\nI'm just going to roll over and die\n\n01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:29.700\nYay!\n\n01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:31.700\nI heard your brains\n\n01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.700\nWeird young hologram brains\n\n01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:39.700\nHurry up and die, old man\n\n01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:43.700\nThey could have our future world\n\n01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:47.700\nGet out of our way, fatty\n\n01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:51.700\nOld fat man\n\n01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.700\nWith your dumb\n\n01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:55.700\n70s\n\n01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.700\nConcepts\n\n01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.700\nWait, I said dumb 70s in pause\n\n01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:09.700\nThe glasses\n\n01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:15.700\nFirst of all, like I was searching\n\n01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.700\nFor the word glasses\n\n01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:19.700\nWhile touching them\n\n01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:21.700\nWhat do you call these on my face?\n\n01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.700\nSecond of all, come on\n\n01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:27.700\nIt's supposed to be safe here\n\n01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.700\nCalling myself old and fat\n\n01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.700\nAnd you're going\n\n01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:33.700\nDon't forget your glasses are dumb\n\n01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:35.700\nAnd you don't shower either\n\n01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:45.700\nAlright, so we got a mercy\n\n01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:47.700\nWe got a night blade, we got a horde guard\n\n01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.700\nWe got a doctor\n\n01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:51.700\nJeff's character\n\n01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:53.700\nWe're fine\n\n01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:55.700\nHave a girl play Jeff's character\n\n01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:57.700\nWe got Annie\n\n01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:59.700\nWe got real life Annie\n\n01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:01.700\nYou've had your big moment in the spotlight\n\n01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.700\nI don't think that's a good enough reason\n\n01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.700\nYou seem kind of beleaguered by it\n\n01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.700\nI don't blame you\n\n01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:17.700\nPeople feel like I should be up there\n\n01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:25.700\nThe guys have been talking\n\n01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.700\nThat sounds like a mandate\n\n01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.700\nWe just don't even have enough chairs\n\n01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:33.700\nWe don't even have enough chairs\n\n01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:35.700\nThis is all behind people\n\n01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.700\nWe're not going to reject Annie and then say yes to Adam\n\n01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:39.700\nThat's not\n\n01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.700\nThat's crazy\n\n01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:43.700\nI sure was\n\n01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:45.700\nAlright\n\n01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.700\nAdam Goldberg\n\n01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.700\nOne of these days\n\n01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:51.700\nCurtis will be back\n\n01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:53.700\nRight to the moon\n\n01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:55.700\nAdam Goldberg told me in the green room\n\n01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:57.700\nWhich he's not allowed in\n\n01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:59.700\nThat he wrote a\n\n01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:01.700\nHe did knock though\n\n01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:03.700\nWhich if you knock on the green room door\n\n01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:05.700\nWhy are you near the green room\n\n01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.700\nI enjoyed his knock\n\n01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:15.700\nIt was pleasurable to me\n\n01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.700\nHe wrote a quiz\n\n01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.700\nWhich obviously we don't have time to do tonight\n\n01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:21.700\nI thought he wrote it for the AV club\n\n01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:23.700\nI'm way\n\n01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.700\nMy assistant is so fired\n\n01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.700\nWhat's up\n\n01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.700\nIs Dustin going to do a music\n\n01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:33.700\nOr\n\n01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:35.700\nAm I going to do it off a cappella\n\n01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:37.700\nIs that even what you guys are looking for right now\n\n01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.700\nAnnie why don't you come up\n\n01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:41.700\nDo you need help\n\n01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.700\nAnything\n\n01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:45.700\nYeah\n\n01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.700\nI forgot\n\n01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.700\nWe'll have Annie play\n\n01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:51.700\nI can't remember\n\n01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.700\nEve Libertine\n\n01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.700\nAlright thank you Annie\n\n01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:57.700\nReal life Annie\n\n01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.700\nAfter that\n\n01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:01.700\nEnthusiastic\n\n01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.700\nNo\n\n01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:05.700\nConditional love\n\n01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:07.700\nLapid\n\n01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.700\nDid you like the finale\n\n01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.700\nLike seriously\n\n01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.700\nThe whole scene\n\n01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.700\nLike you're like oh pick out this costume\n\n01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:17.700\nAnd I'm like okay sure\n\n01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.700\nAnd then it's like there's literally this whole scene\n\n01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:21.700\nAbout what we were talking about\n\n01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:23.700\nAnd then with that button\n\n01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:25.700\nOf Annie saying like a misfiring skirt\n\n01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.700\nLike it was like\n\n01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.700\nIt was like you were speaking and it was like we were speaking\n\n01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.700\nDid you\n\n01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:33.700\nWhat did you think about the\n\n01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.700\nIt was like three in the morning\n\n01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:37.700\nI'd shoot the last scene\n\n01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.700\nAnd I'd been up all night and I got\n\n01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:41.700\nI wrote the scene and Annie enters the study room\n\n01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:43.700\nAnd Jeff is standing there\n\n01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.700\nAnd the cursor's been blinking there forever\n\n01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.700\nAnd I wrote like four different versions\n\n01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.700\nI wrote like truly raunchy like\n\n01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:51.700\nThe joke is how horny they are for each other\n\n01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:53.700\nScenes and then I erased it\n\n01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.700\nAnd I wrote like\n\n01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.700\nOh why are we still forcing this\n\n01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.700\nWe're not into this and this version\n\n01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:01.700\nAnd I just like all erased and the cursor's still blinking\n\n01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:03.700\nAnd then I had Erin on instant message\n\n01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.700\nAnd I said what do I do\n\n01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.700\nWhat do I do here\n\n01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:09.700\nAnd Erin said have you ever seen Drop Dead Fred\n\n01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:11.700\nAnd\n\n01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:13.700\nAnd I said no I actually haven't seen it\n\n01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:15.700\nAnd she was like there's a very sweet kiss\n\n01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:17.700\nAt the end of Drop Dead Fred\n\n01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:19.700\nShe has to kiss Drop Dead Fred goodbye\n\n01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:21.700\nIt's not a sexual kiss\n\n01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:23.700\nIt's not necessarily an unromantic kiss\n\n01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:25.700\nBut it's not\n\n01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.700\nIt's not\n\n01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.700\nThey're not macking on each other as the kids said\n\n01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:31.700\nIn 1982\n\n01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:33.700\nBut\n\n01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:35.700\nIt was like a kiss goodbye\n\n01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:37.700\nLike it was love\n\n01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:39.700\nWhat did you think\n\n01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.700\nI try not to\n\n01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.700\nShip because I believe that the people\n\n01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:45.700\nWho are making our television for us should be making\n\n01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:47.700\nThose decisions and people shouldn't be complaining\n\n01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.700\nOn the internet about it just because they want to see two people kiss\n\n01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:51.700\nOh shit\n\n01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:53.700\nAlright\n\n01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:55.700\nThank you\n\n01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:57.700\nBut that being said\n\n01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.700\nTwo things\n\n01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:01.700\nNot only was it a really nice\n\n01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:03.700\nAnd not a really done thing\n\n01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:05.700\nI also really love that in Jeff's fantasy\n\n01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.700\nShe was wearing the same outfit\n\n01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.700\nHe was still coming back to that\n\n01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:11.700\nYeah well that was\n\n01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.700\nFaster to shoot that way\n\n01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:17.700\nThe truth comes out\n\n01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.700\nAlright anyways yeah that was weird for me to\n\n01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.700\nFish like actually it was\n\n01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:25.700\nI wanted more to give Erin credit\n\n01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.700\nFor helping me write the\n\n01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:29.700\nThe final scene\n\n01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:31.700\nOf the season\n\n01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:33.700\nWith some nice sweet advice\n\n01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:35.700\nCold from a silly movie\n\n01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:37.700\nThat I hadn't seen\n\n01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.700\nThat's called a muse\n\n01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:41.700\nThat's what you call\n\n01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.700\nYeah\n\n01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:45.700\nBecause women can't be writers but they can be muses\n\n01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.700\nAs long as it's not that horrible Sharon Stone movie\n\n01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:57.700\nThat's an Albert Brooks movie\n\n01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:59.700\nThey were both in it\n\n01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:01.700\nAlright\n\n01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:03.700\nAlright well I guess\n\n01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.700\nThat's it\n\n01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:07.700\nWhat else could I possibly do\n\n01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:09.700\nTo slow down the show\n\n01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.700\nOh did you notice I'm in costume\n\n01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.700\nYou're wearing the same thing right\n\n01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:15.700\nThe costume in question sort of\n\n01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:17.700\nRight but this is it\n\n01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:19.700\nYou're so impressed\n\n01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.700\nIt's silent it's amazing\n\n01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:23.700\nWelcome to cosplay\n\n01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:25.700\nIt's this boring\n\n01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.700\nWell yeah when you're cosplaying just a regular person\n\n01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:29.700\nRight\n\n01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:31.700\nHey I spent four hours\n\n01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.700\nSewing this ruffle onto my dress\n\n01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:35.700\nOh no\n\n01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.700\nFour hours\n\n01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.700\nFor those of you who aren't watching the video\n\n01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.700\nIf Annie just threw her cane\n\n01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:43.700\nI'm so mad\n\n01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:45.700\nIn anger because no one applauded her outfit\n\n01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.700\nDon't do it now now you just be\n\n01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:49.700\nThey weren't gonna do it\n\n01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.700\nOkay now that's horrible\n\n01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.700\nThat's a toxic\n\n01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:55.700\nThat was terrible\n\n01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.700\nThat was like that little tiny turd that comes out of my dog\n\n01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.700\nWhen I make him poop\n\n01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:01.700\nI'm like you can't\n\n01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.700\nYou're great training him\n\n01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:05.700\nYou better pretend to pee if nothing else\n\n01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.700\nThen you can come back in and eat\n\n01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:09.700\nAnd he's like a little drop comes out\n\n01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.700\nAlright\n\n01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:13.700\nIs there a guest\n\n01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:15.700\nMike are you having a good time\n\n01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:17.700\nYes although I'm nervous now\n\n01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.700\nI'm gonna screw this up\n\n01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:21.700\nHave you memorized the sheet yet\n\n01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.700\nI'm gonna take him back in two minutes\n\n01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:27.700\nYou'll very quickly see\n\n01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.700\nThat nervousness will give way to\n\n01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:31.700\nFrustration and boredom\n\n01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:33.700\nNot induced by your skills\n\n01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:35.700\nI mean I'd say it is\n\n01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:37.700\nBut yeah if you get\n\n01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:39.700\nConfused just kinda\n\n01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.700\nWithdraw you don't have to really dig in\n\n01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.700\nDeeper and try and understand any of that\n\n01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:45.700\nStuff so\n\n01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:47.700\nThere you go\n\n01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:49.700\nAnd now\n\n01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.700\nIt's time\n\n01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:53.700\nFor a new episode of\n\n01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:55.700\nShadow Run\n\n01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.700\nIs there a guest\n\n01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.700\nThat we have to give credit for\n\n01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:05.700\nYeah this one is just a tweet that Jeff Davis sent\n\n01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:07.700\nOh okay\n\n01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:09.700\nGuest summarizer Jeff Davis\n\n01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:11.700\nYup\n\n01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:13.700\nAlright\n\n01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:15.700\nWhere's the cue\n\n01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:17.700\nHere it is\n\n01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.700\nAlright\n\n01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.700\nHarmontown Shadow Run recap now\n\n01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:23.700\nEve had an eagle flap tear gas out\n\n01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.700\nMercy was composed\n\n01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.700\nBut cried\n\n01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:29.700\nNightblade baked a guard's brains\n\n01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.700\nDicks were of average size\n\n01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:35.700\nThat's it\n\n01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:39.700\nI baked a brain\n\n01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.700\nYeah I mean realistically\n\n01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.700\nSomeone broke a window\n\n01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:45.700\nSo that tear gas could leave\n\n01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:47.700\nAnd then you taste someone so hard\n\n01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.700\nAs brain melted\n\n01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.700\nAlright so we're like in a room\n\n01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:53.700\nIn this kind of hospital\n\n01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:55.700\nYou're in the hospital of a brain plus\n\n01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:57.700\nLimited you're in the C Beta Ward\n\n01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:59.700\nYou snuck in there\n\n01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:01.700\nUsing lies and\n\n01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:03.700\nSutterfuge to try and infiltrate this place\n\n01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:05.700\nYou're looking for secret stolen data\n\n01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:07.700\nWell I don't know if it's stolen\n\n01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:09.700\nSecret data\n\n01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:11.700\nThat you're trying to steal\n\n01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:13.700\nFor your employer\n\n01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:15.700\nAre we all in the same room\n\n01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:17.700\nYeah you're all in the same room\n\n01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.700\nThere's two guards knocked out on the floor\n\n01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.700\nThey're unconscious\n\n01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:23.700\nAlright well you guys know what I'm thinking\n\n01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.700\nIt's the old dress as a guard\n\n01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:31.700\nYou know what\n\n01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.700\nI just started taking off the guards\n\n01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:35.700\nOne of the guards pants\n\n01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:37.700\nI'm a man of action\n\n01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:39.700\nI'm not going to explain myself\n\n01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:43.700\nAnd since we're in a hospital\n\n01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:45.700\nAnd I'm a doctor\n\n01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.700\nI'm going to stay in my clothes\n\n01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:51.700\nAnd just pretend like I'm a doctor\n\n01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:53.700\nIn this hospital\n\n01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:55.700\nIs that okay?\n\n01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:57.700\nI'm going to size up my compatriots\n\n01:29:57.700 --> 01:29:59.700\nAnd compare them to the sizes of the\n\n01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:01.700\nIndisposed guards to see who might\n\n01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:03.700\nFit in their clothes better\n\n01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:05.700\nOne of the guards\n\n01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:07.700\nIs\n\n01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:09.700\nHuman sized\n\n01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:11.700\nThat's the only guard whose clothes\n\n01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:13.700\nHaven't been removed\n\n01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.700\nAlright\n\n01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:21.700\nI'll undress this guard and stick these\n\n01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:23.700\nHuman sized clothes on\n\n01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.700\nThey feel really good\n\n01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:29.700\nThey absolutely do\n\n01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:31.700\nPleather\n\n01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.700\nWell\n\n01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:37.700\nSince horticard\n\n01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:39.700\nSince you kind of have the psychic abilities\n\n01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.700\nBut I'm also rather minute\n\n01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:43.700\nSo perhaps the clothes would not fit on me\n\n01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:45.700\nThat's quite true\n\n01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:47.700\nThink they'd fit me\n\n01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:49.700\nYeah, yeah I'd say\n\n01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:51.700\nYou're pretty average\n\n01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:53.700\nI'll get dressed up as the other guard\n\n01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:55.700\nThat happens\n\n01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:57.700\nTwo suits of guard clothes\n\n01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:59.700\nAlright\n\n01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:01.700\nWell\n\n01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:03.700\nNow we need to play in\n\n01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:05.700\nWait a minute\n\n01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:07.700\nDo I not have clothes on?\n\n01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:09.700\nYou have normal people\n\n01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.700\nClothes on\n\n01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.700\nSo you don't need more guards\n\n01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:15.700\nWell there aren't any more guards\n\n01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:17.700\nThat could be an avenue to explore\n\n01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:19.700\nYeah maybe we should go find some more\n\n01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:21.700\nAnd\n\n01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:23.700\nI was wondering if I could use spell casting\n\n01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:25.700\nTo create a uniform for myself\n\n01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:27.700\nSorry\n\n01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:29.700\nWhy don't you\n\n01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.700\nPsychically scope out the\n\n01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:33.700\nOutside area\n\n01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:35.700\nSee if we're going to get a lay on the land\n\n01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.700\nSo I'm going to use a short of\n\n01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:39.700\nOne of these\n\n01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:43.700\nSort of mental\n\n01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:45.700\nMental waves, mental planning\n\n01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.700\nSort of active softs\n\n01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.700\nTo scope and see if there are any guards\n\n01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:51.700\nIn the vicinity\n\n01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:53.700\nYou got that was like a detect\n\n01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:55.700\nDetect humans\n\n01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:57.700\nKind of spell\n\n01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:59.700\nProvided the guards are human\n\n01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:01.700\nYeah\n\n01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:03.700\nWell you do that\n\n01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:05.700\nYou detect not any guards\n\n01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:07.700\nAnywhere nearby or in the outside hall\n\n01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:09.700\nExcept for the one that you\n\n01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:11.700\nWell you can't detect it because it's dead\n\n01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:13.700\nBut you detect humans\n\n01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:15.700\nNot in this hall but in the next hall\n\n01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.700\nOver there's all sorts of them\n\n01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:19.700\nWith weaker auras\n\n01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.700\nSome of them are sick and damaged\n\n01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:23.700\nHave cyberwares\n\n01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:25.700\nAnd certain ailments that are causing\n\n01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:27.700\nTheir spirits to look differently\n\n01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:29.700\nColored the normal to your senses\n\n01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.700\nThis would suggest to me that they are\n\n01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:33.700\nPerhaps patients\n\n01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:35.700\nSubjects\n\n01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:37.700\nThat the chips might also\n\n01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:39.700\nBe in this room, is this possible\n\n01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:41.700\nThat they're being tested on them\n\n01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:43.700\nYou don't know\n\n01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:45.700\nAnything about that\n\n01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:47.700\nI have like a meta question\n\n01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:49.700\nYes\n\n01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:51.700\nLike do I not remember\n\n01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:53.700\nYou saying\n\n01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:55.700\nDidn't we scope this place out\n\n01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.700\nAnd there's like some computer room\n\n01:32:57.700 --> 01:32:59.700\nThere's a security room\n\n01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:01.700\nIn the top floor of the building\n\n01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:03.700\nThat someone found\n\n01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.700\nI don't know who it was\n\n01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:07.700\nThat's gotta be where the butterfly would be\n\n01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:09.700\nWell it would be with securities\n\n01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:11.700\nLet's rate the butterfly\n\n01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:13.700\nI mean\n\n01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:15.700\nLook, jeez\n\n01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:17.700\nI'm not really a thinking man\n\n01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:19.700\nIt's not that the guy playing me is stupid\n\n01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:21.700\nIt's\n\n01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:23.700\nThe guy playing me is like\n\n01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.700\nThe Dustin Hoffman of role playing\n\n01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:27.700\nThe character of me\n\n01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:29.700\nI'm just an idiot\n\n01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:31.700\nA little drunk\n\n01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:33.700\nI deserve accolades\n\n01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:35.700\nNot\n\n01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:37.700\nFor anyone to think I'm a bad, bad player\n\n01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:43.700\nI guess I'm kind of at a loss\n\n01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:45.700\nI think we just gotta find\n\n01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:47.700\nLike records room\n\n01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:49.700\nI guess I would start up with that security area\n\n01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:51.700\nDoes the maps off\n\n01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.700\nIs it detailed enough to have a map inside the building\n\n01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:55.700\nNo, you don't have any maps of this building\n\n01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:57.700\nQuite\n\n01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:59.700\nMay I use my vision zoom\n\n01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:01.700\nTo look through\n\n01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:03.700\nThe building to find\n\n01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:05.700\nThe\n\n01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.700\nSecurity room\n\n01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:09.700\nThe vision zoom is like a magnifying\n\n01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:11.700\nKind of thing\n\n01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:13.700\nIt can't see through stuff, but like you could see\n\n01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:15.700\n60 feet away\n\n01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:17.700\nSo if I leave\n\n01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:19.700\nLooking for it\n\n01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:21.700\nI'll use my vision zoom\n\n01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:23.700\nAnd I'll be in the hallway\n\n01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:25.700\nAnd I can see it\n\n01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:27.700\nRight at the end of the hallway\n\n01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:29.700\nIf it is there\n\n01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:31.700\nYes\n\n01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:33.700\nWell, I mean\n\n01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:35.700\nLet me look\n\n01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:37.700\nYou head out into the hallway using your vision zoom\n\n01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:39.700\nAnd you only see\n\n01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:41.700\nA hallway leading to the\n\n01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:43.700\nI can't see\n\n01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:45.700\nNo good\n\n01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:47.700\nThe B Beta Ward\n\n01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:49.700\nWhat about, can I use perception\n\n01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:51.700\nTo\n\n01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.700\nFind out where we're supposed to go\n\n01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:55.700\nYeah, you look around\n\n01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.700\nAnd you locate a small plaque\n\n01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:59.700\nThat has a virtual\n\n01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:01.700\nReadout of the map of the place\n\n01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:03.700\nAnd you can see all the\n\n01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:05.700\nOffices with listings for all the\n\n01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.700\nEmployees and there's an office\n\n01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.700\nThat still lists Baldwin Brown\n\n01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.700\nAh\n\n01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:13.700\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:15.700\nI would suggest we use my\n\n01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:17.700\nSneaking 4 plus 2\n\n01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:19.700\nTo sneak there\n\n01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:21.700\nTo sneak there, it's going to be quite\n\n01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:23.700\nSome ways you trace your way through the map\n\n01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:25.700\nAnd you're going to at least have to go down some\n\n01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:27.700\nStairs that are located by the\n\n01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:29.700\nCentral cafeteria area\n\n01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:31.700\nI can't do stairs\n\n01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:33.700\nMetta\n\n01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.700\nThere's a\n\n01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.700\nMe and Mercy will go\n\n01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.700\nWith you\n\n01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.700\nIf she's with guards, you know\n\n01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:43.700\nShe should be safer\n\n01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:45.700\nShe won't look like an interloper\n\n01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:47.700\nYou guys are on your own\n\n01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:49.700\nI'm a bad leader\n\n01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:51.700\nCould we\n\n01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:53.700\nPerhaps leave the doctor\n\n01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:55.700\nWith the\n\n01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:57.700\nGuards who have been redressed\n\n01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:59.700\nIs that possible\n\n01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:01.700\nTo keep an eye on them, should they wake\n\n01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.700\nAnd possibly\n\n01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:05.700\nI would like to follow them\n\n01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:07.700\nWith you, with the guards\n\n01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:09.700\nLeave me with the guards\n\n01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:11.700\nOkay\n\n01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:13.700\nThat's\n\n01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:15.700\nKind of a shit duty\n\n01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.700\nIt's what I usually do\n\n01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:19.700\nI wind up waiting\n\n01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:21.700\nIn the car, but at least I'm in the room\n\n01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:23.700\nThis time\n\n01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:25.700\nWhy don't we\n\n01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:27.700\nMake sure they don't wake up for a long time\n\n01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:29.700\nI stun them both again\n\n01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:31.700\nTheir bodies twitch\n\n01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:33.700\nI don't want anyone to feel\n\n01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.700\nLeft out\n\n01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:37.700\nThis is the shadow run\n\n01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:39.700\nMaybe what we could do\n\n01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:41.700\nIs we could put you\n\n01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:43.700\nIn a wheelchair\n\n01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:45.700\nI'm the doctor\n\n01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:47.700\nAnd we could be walking down\n\n01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.700\nLike I've got my\n\n01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:51.700\nI've got my file\n\n01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.700\nHere and we're on our way to a\n\n01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:55.700\nYou know, to have her look at\n\n01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:57.700\nOkay\n\n01:36:57.700 --> 01:36:59.700\nWe'll just kind of escort you\n\n01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.700\nEverybody's together\n\n01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:03.700\nWatch the guards\n\n01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:05.700\nThat's what I'll do\n\n01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:07.700\nWell, otherwise I'd be the only one\n\n01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:09.700\nLooking like a weirdo\n\n01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:11.700\nYou come with too\n\n01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.700\nWe've got two guards, a doctor, a patient\n\n01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:15.700\nIt's not like anyone's going to go\n\n01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:17.700\nBut who's that guy?\n\n01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:19.700\nIt looks like I can forge some documents\n\n01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.700\nDo you need those medical records forged?\n\n01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:23.700\nYes\n\n01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:25.700\nJust trying to help\n\n01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:27.700\nNo, I had\n\n01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:29.700\nDid I sound sarcastic?\n\n01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:31.700\nI got really excited about you forging documents\n\n01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:33.700\nI got really excited too\n\n01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.700\nLet's do it\n\n01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.700\nLet's do a montage of him forging documents\n\n01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:41.700\nIs there a music cue?\n\n01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:43.700\nNope, there's no music guy\n\n01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:45.700\nDustin's getting high\n\n01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:47.700\nHe's like\n\n01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:49.700\nNo, there's none\n\n01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:55.700\nAnd then documents\n\n01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:57.700\nAlright\n\n01:37:57.700 --> 01:37:59.700\nLet's get some out\n\n01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:01.700\nThey're really convincing looking to your eyes\n\n01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:03.700\nI wish I could whistle\n\n01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:05.700\nSo I could do that\n\n01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:07.700\nThese are some smart looking docs\n\n01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:13.700\nYou know it\n\n01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:15.700\nIt's what I do\n\n01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:21.700\nEverybody take a document\n\n01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:25.700\nEven the doctor\n\n01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:27.700\nLet's go\n\n01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:29.700\nHead for the Baldwin's office\n\n01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:31.700\nAlright\n\n01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:33.700\nYou do that\n\n01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:35.700\nYou charge out into the hallway and down\n\n01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:37.700\nDown the hallway and through a door\n\n01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:39.700\nAs you open the door\n\n01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:41.700\nYou hear the sounds behind you\n\n01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:43.700\nOf five or six guards shuffling into the hallway\n\n01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:45.700\nThey're just kind of looking around\n\n01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:47.700\nBut they don't seem bothered by your\n\n01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.700\nOfficial looking presence\n\n01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:53.700\nYou cross out of the hallway\n\n01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:55.700\nAnd into the cafeteria area\n\n01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:57.700\nYou see all sorts of delicious\n\n01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:59.700\nSalads\n\n01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:01.700\nReal salads\n\n01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:03.700\nNot the fake shit\n\n01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:05.700\nBut\n\n01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:07.700\nYou're only distracted momentarily\n\n01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.700\nYou get to the elevator\n\n01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:11.700\nWhich is next to the stairwell that I mentioned earlier\n\n01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:15.700\nI press a button\n\n01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:17.700\nWhich one?\n\n01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:23.700\nOne of you guys want to help me pick a button?\n\n01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:25.700\nWhich floor was Baldwin on?\n\n01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:27.700\nDown\n\n01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:29.700\nDown\n\n01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:31.700\nDid you say that?\n\n01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.700\nDid you say down?\n\n01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:35.700\nYou want to press it?\n\n01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:37.700\nYou press it\n\n01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:41.700\nAlright the elevator arrives\n\n01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:43.700\nAlright\n\n01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:47.700\nThis is so amazing\n\n01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:49.700\nWe're fucking nailing this\n\n01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:51.700\nI've been on a lot of Shadow Runs\n\n01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:53.700\nAnd I was like\n\n01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:55.700\nThis is fucking butter\n\n01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:57.700\nIt's a nice quiet moment\n\n01:39:57.700 --> 01:39:59.700\nIn the elevator together\n\n01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.700\nLet's get to know each other\n\n01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:03.700\nWhere'd you learn to forge documents like that?\n\n01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:07.700\nUse of practice\n\n01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:09.700\nYou're looking really sharp in that\n\n01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:11.700\nOh thanks\n\n01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:13.700\nI used to work in law enforcement\n\n01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:15.700\nIt's part of my dark past\n\n01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:17.700\nHow you doing doc?\n\n01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:19.700\nI'm good\n\n01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:21.700\nIs this stirring your annoyance\n\n01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:23.700\nTo be back in a medical establishment?\n\n01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:25.700\nI'm back where I need to be\n\n01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:27.700\nWhy'd you fall from grace?\n\n01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:33.700\nI'm sorry\n\n01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:35.700\nIt's nothing I want to talk about\n\n01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.700\nTalk about right now\n\n01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:39.700\nIf I summon some butterflies\n\n01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:41.700\nWould we all shut up?\n\n01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:43.700\nThe fuck?\n\n01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:45.700\nI was just making a joke\n\n01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:47.700\nI'm sorry\n\n01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:49.700\nI'm not Jeff\n\n01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:51.700\nIn case you didn't notice\n\n01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:55.700\nAwkward\n\n01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:57.700\nThe door opens\n\n01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:59.700\nInto a large reception like area\n\n01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:01.700\nWith no windows\n\n01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:03.700\nIt seems like you may be underground\n\n01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:05.700\nOr something\n\n01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:07.700\nSo there's a nice receptionist\n\n01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:09.700\nSeated at a desk\n\n01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:11.700\nHer brown hair\n\n01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:13.700\nSharp\n\n01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:15.700\nStylish\n\n01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:17.700\nFuture style\n\n01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:19.700\nIt looks crazy but normal for you guys\n\n01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:25.700\nShe looks up at you expectantly\n\n01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:27.700\nShe doesn't say anything though\n\n01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.700\nHey Mercy\n\n01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:31.700\nYou're usually the tricky talker\n\n01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:33.700\nYou'll see by these documents\n\n01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:35.700\nThere you go\n\n01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:37.700\nShe looks at the documents\n\n01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:39.700\nAnd inspects them thoroughly\n\n01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:41.700\nShe's like this is great\n\n01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:43.700\nI was just saying that\n\n01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:45.700\nIn the elevator\n\n01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.700\nThis guy's amazing\n\n01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:49.700\nBut she glances over\n\n01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:51.700\nAt horticard\n\n01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:53.700\nAnd it's like that guy\n\n01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:55.700\nWho's he?\n\n01:41:57.700 --> 01:41:59.700\nVery comely\n\n01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:01.700\nVery stoically\n\n01:42:01.700 -->

something\n\n01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:35.700\nAlright\n\n01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:37.700\nWe're supposed to be here\n\n01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:39.700\nSo shut up\n\n01:42:43.700 -->

this guy? He says he works here\n\n01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:07.700\nHe gives me an ID that shows\n\n01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:09.700\nHe works at the different location\n\n01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:11.700\nHe's a fancy fucking security consultant\n\n01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:13.700\nYou're talking your way into a god damn\n\n01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:15.700\nLike a\n\n01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:17.700\nBurnt bridge to nowhere\n\n01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.700\nAren't you a temp?\n\n01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:21.700\nI'm Dr. Friend\n\n01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:23.700\nAnd this is my patient\n\n01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:25.700\nAnd\n\n01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:27.700\nHe's in serious condition\n\n01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:29.700\nAnd needs help\n\n01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:31.700\nAnd we need to get to Dr. Brown's office\n\n01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:33.700\nYou're going to let us go\n\n01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:35.700\nAnd that's the end of it\n\n01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:37.700\nOh alright\n\n01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:41.700\nYou're the doctor\n\n01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:43.700\nThank you\n\n01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.700\nShe lets you go through\n\n01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:51.700\nThe door into the next room\n\n01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:53.700\nAlright I hope that works\n\n01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:57.700\nI mean I can't\n\n01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:59.700\nI don't read people that well\n\n01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.700\nWhere's\n\n01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:03.700\nWhere's Brown\n\n01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:05.700\nYou're in a large circular\n\n01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:07.700\nRoom it's completely\n\n01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:09.700\nCircular there's a central\n\n01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:11.700\nKind of\n\n01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:13.700\nAlso circular area\n\n01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:15.700\nLooks like it's maybe some sort of shaft\n\n01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:17.700\nOr who knows what\n\n01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.700\nBut doors are on the outside of this\n\n01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:21.700\nRoom kind of radiating off\n\n01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:23.700\nLike spokes all over the place\n\n01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:25.700\nYou smell formaldehyde\n\n01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:27.700\nAnd other unsavory smells\n\n01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:29.700\nAll over the place\n\n01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.700\nIt's heavy in the air down here\n\n01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:33.700\nMust not get too much ventilation\n\n01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:35.700\nDown here or something\n\n01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:37.700\nIt's making it smell shitty\n\n01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:39.700\nSee six doors\n\n01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:41.700\nExcluding the one you came through\n\n01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:43.700\nTo the waiting area\n\n01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:45.700\nAlright\n\n01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:47.700\nLet's look for Baldwin Brown's door\n\n01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:49.700\nThere's one that says\n\n01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:51.700\n207\n\n01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:53.700\nThat's the number of Baldwin Brown's office\n\n01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:55.700\nYou guys\n\n01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:05.700\nFor those just listening\n\n01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:07.700\nAnnie's pain\n\n01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:09.700\nThis is like a low budget\n\n01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:11.700\nMic drop\n\n01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:17.700\nI'll stay in guard\n\n01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:19.700\nIn case that receptionist stuff\n\n01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:21.700\nDidn't really work\n\n01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:23.700\nI'll just zapper\n\n01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:27.700\nAnybody comes through here\n\n01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:29.700\nThey won't get much further\n\n01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:31.700\nI'll tell you that for nothing\n\n01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:33.700\nBut just as you're saying that\n\n01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.700\nYou're chirping\n\n01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:37.700\nOf your comlink\n\n01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:39.700\nMaking some noise as if you're receiving\n\n01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:41.700\nSome sort of call\n\n01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:43.700\nFrom an encrypted line\n\n01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.700\nHello\n\n01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.700\nHey\n\n01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:49.700\nRemember me\n\n01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:51.700\nNo\n\n01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:55.700\nIt's Baldwin\n\n01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:57.700\nBaldwin Brown\n\n01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:59.700\nYou got me my latest job\n\n01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:01.700\nYeah\n\n01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:03.700\nWait what\n\n01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:05.700\nYou delivered me to a new employer\n\n01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:07.700\nYeah\n\n01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:09.700\nDid they kill you?\n\n01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:11.700\nNo I'm still alive\n\n01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:13.700\nThat's great\n\n01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:15.700\nIt's better than not being that\n\n01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:17.700\nYou're right\n\n01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:19.700\nAnyway\n\n01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:21.700\nIt has come to my attention\n\n01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:23.700\nThat you're going after some of my research\n\n01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:25.700\nIt seems my employer has hired you\n\n01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:27.700\nTo steal that research\n\n01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:29.700\nFrom me for their benefit\n\n01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:31.700\nWhat?\n\n01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:37.700\nIf you say so\n\n01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:39.700\nI mean I'm not looking to\n\n01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:41.700\nStart anything here\n\n01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:43.700\nI'm just saying you know\n\n01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.700\nI really don't want them to have it\n\n01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:47.700\nThey didn't earn it\n\n01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:49.700\nIt's dangerous if they have it\n\n01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:51.700\nThe world's gonna end\n\n01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:53.700\nAll sorts of shit\n\n01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:55.700\nPlease don't deliver it to them\n\n01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:57.700\nListen Baldwin\n\n01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:59.700\nDiscuss why we shouldn't\n\n01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:01.700\nDo our jobs\n\n01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:03.700\nWhen you're doing your job\n\n01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:05.700\nAnd everyone in the world does their job\n\n01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:07.700\nMaybe we could make up a new job\n\n01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:09.700\nWhere you pay us to not do our jobs\n\n01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:11.700\nThat's also\n\n01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:13.700\nThere's a vast American tradition in that\n\n01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:15.700\nIt's called subsidy\n\n01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:17.700\nYou know\n\n01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:19.700\nI had an uncle who had a friend\n\n01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:21.700\nHe literally\n\n01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:23.700\nHis job was to not grow corn\n\n01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:25.700\nOf course\n\n01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:27.700\nThese were the old days\n\n01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:29.700\nBefore the pocket clips\n\n01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:33.700\nWhen there was corn\n\n01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:37.700\nNow you see a salad\n\n01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:39.700\nYou fucking freak out\n\n01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:41.700\nBack then there was corn everywhere\n\n01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:43.700\nSo anyways\n\n01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:45.700\nWithout\n\n01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:47.700\nFreaking out\n\n01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:49.700\nWe're really close to our objective\n\n01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:51.700\nWe're gonna follow through on it\n\n01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:53.700\nCause dumb to get this far\n\n01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:55.700\nI'm under tight surveillance\n\n01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:57.700\nI mean I'm not\n\n01:47:57.700 --> 01:47:59.700\nI'm not under\n\n01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:01.700\nI'm not allowed to leave the building\n\n01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:03.700\nI can't escape physically\n\n01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:05.700\nSo I'm kinda stuck here\n\n01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:07.700\nWell you got phone privileges\n\n01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:09.700\nSo why don't you call us\n\n01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:11.700\nIn 10 minutes\n\n01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:17.700\nAnyway I'm sending one of my\n\n01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:19.700\nAssociates to your location\n\n01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:21.700\nMaybe we can make a drop\n\n01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:23.700\nIf you're willing\n\n01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:25.700\nAsk him what it's worth\n\n01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:27.700\nTell him he's breaking up\n\n01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:29.700\nI can break it\n\n01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:31.700\nIt doesn't work\n\n01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:33.700\nIt's been 30 years since that's been\n\n01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:35.700\nA valid excuse\n\n01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:41.700\nWell hold on\n\n01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:43.700\nI'm gonna put you on the phone with\n\n01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:45.700\nMercy\n\n01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:47.700\nI'm just a hood\n\n01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:49.700\nI'm just like a muscle\n\n01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.700\nI'm gonna put you on the phone with\n\n01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:53.700\nMercy\n\n01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:55.700\nShe's like the diplomat\n\n01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:57.700\nAnd the talker\n\n01:48:57.700 --> 01:48:59.700\nHello\n\n01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:01.700\nIt's Baldwin\n\n01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:03.700\nBaldwin who\n\n01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:07.700\nBaldwin Brown\n\n01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:09.700\nRemember me\n\n01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:15.700\nBaldwin Brown\n\n01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:17.700\nNo\n\n01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:19.700\nWell that's okay\n\n01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:21.700\nYou don't need to know who I am\n\n01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:23.700\nI don't think\n\n01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:25.700\nYou're allowed to just say you found him\n\n01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:27.700\nI heard\n\n01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:29.700\nIt's nice sneaking and we find them\n\n01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:31.700\nWell no\n\n01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:33.700\nThere's this door\n\n01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:35.700\nIt's got all sorts of crazy locks\n\n01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:37.700\nIt looks like it has some sort of biometric scanner on it\n\n01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:39.700\nThat needs some sort of important\n\n01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:41.700\nAuthorized data to let someone through\n\n01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.700\nShit\n\n01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:45.700\nI look on my person for like\n\n01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:47.700\nDoesn't Mercy have some sort of access\n\n01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:49.700\nTo these sorts of things?\n\n01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:51.700\nWe're security guard closed\n\n01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:53.700\nDon't we have something on us that's like a\n\n01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:55.700\nYou know like a card?\n\n01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:57.700\nIt doesn't seem to be reacting to the thing\n\n01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:59.700\nIt seems like\n\n01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:01.700\nIf I use these smart linked\n\n01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:03.700\nSunglasses\n\n01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:05.700\nIs there a way to tap into the system\n\n01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:07.700\nMaybe backdoor it and find a code from inside\n\n01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:11.700\nDo you have hacking? I don't think you do\n\n01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:13.700\nI have lock picking that won't work\n\n01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:15.700\nNope\n\n01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.700\nI have computer, software, hardware\n\n01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:19.700\nI mean very low\n\n01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:21.700\nRatings\n\n01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:23.700\nWhat was the first one?\n\n01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:25.700\nArcana\n\n01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:27.700\nWe're in a shadow run and no one knows how to\n\n01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:29.700\nFucking do computer shit\n\n01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:31.700\nIt's like the fucking\n\n01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:33.700\nPoint\n\n01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:35.700\nYou hear a voice over\n\n01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:37.700\nYour comlinks being all like\n\n01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:39.700\nHey guys\n\n01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:41.700\nDid you say you needed hacking\n\n01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:43.700\nYeah where's that guy god damn it\n\n01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:47.700\nHack

mean\n\n01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:09.700\nI do this remote I've been watching you guys\n\n01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:11.700\nYou set off like 5\n\n01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:13.700\nVibration sensors\n\n01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:15.700\nYou broke a window that's like where they're set\n\n01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:19.700\nAnyway\n\n01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:21.700\nLet me work on this door it'll take\n\n01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:23.700\nA couple minutes\n\n01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:25.700\nAlright keep talking to Baldwin that was good\n\n01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:27.700\nBaldwin you still

this research\n\n01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:49.700\nThat's my life's work\n\n01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:51.700\nThey didn't earn it they're trying to\n\n01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:53.700\nTrying to turn it\n\n01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:55.700\nTo make monies and I'm trying to help people\n\n01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:57.700\nDo you get it\n\n01:51:57.700 --> 01:51:59.700\nI don't I don't have money\n\n01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:01.700\nThey don't even pay me like\n\n01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:03.700\nI don't even think that's legal by their standards\n\n01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:05.700\nBut they don't I mean\n\n01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:07.700\nI could owe you guys\n\n01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:09.700\nBut I don't have the monies\n\n01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:11.700\nAsk him what these things do like what's the big deal\n\n01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:13.700\nWhat do these things do\n\n01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:15.700\nAnd what's the big deal\n\n01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:17.700\nIt's research\n\n01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:19.700\nI mean you guys wouldn't understand it\n\n01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:21.700\nIt has to do with reversing the effects of\n\n01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:23.700\nBTL chip brain degradation\n\n01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:25.700\nI've tapped in on my\n\n01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:27.700\nComlink and I'm listening in\n\n01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:29.700\nCan I apply my\n\n01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:31.700\nAnalyze Truth to sign out\n\n01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:33.700\nSome sense of\n\n01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:35.700\nTruth to his being\n\n01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:37.700\nUnfortunately it doesn't work over electronic communication\n\n01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:39.700\nYeah I thought I'd try\n\n01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:41.700\nIt's worth it\n\n01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:43.700\nWhat if we paid you\n\n01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:45.700\nYeah I mean sure\n\n01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:47.700\nNow you're on our payroll\n\n01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:49.700\nI could be\n\n01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:51.700\nDo you

have to access a digital W9\n\n01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.700\nFor yourself\n\n01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:07.700\nWell that sounds fine\n\n01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:09.700\nHeck I don't rush or anything\n\n01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:11.700\nWe don't want you to do a less than perfect job\n\n01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:13.700\nSo take your time on the door\n\n01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:15.700\nHey man

--> 01:53:23.700\nYou see an antique style\n\n01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:25.700\nOffice it's got old\n\n01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:27.700\nWhat do you call it\n\n01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:29.700\nUnfinishing\n\n01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:31.700\nThat thing where the finishing is going away\n\n01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:33.700\nOld\n\n01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:35.700\nAn old desk\n\n01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:37.700\nTarnished\n\n01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:39.700\nIt's a tarnished desk\n\n01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:41.700\nYou see an old tarnished desk\n\n01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:43.700\nWith a key lock\n\n01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:45.700\nOne of these old style throwback keys\n\n01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:47.700\nKey locks rather\n\n01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:49.700\nThere's not a key in the lock\n\n01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:51.700\nNothing else is in the office\n\n01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:53.700\nIt looks like most of the stuff has been\n\n01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:55.700\nMoved out
