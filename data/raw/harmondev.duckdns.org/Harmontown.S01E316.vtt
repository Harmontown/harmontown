iced tea filling like me.\n\n02:00.440 --> 02:01.440\nIt's not business.\n\n02:01.440 --> 02:02.440\nIt's personal when I eat your pussy business.\n\n02:02.440 --> 02:03.440\nCome on.\n\n02:03.440 --> 02:04.440\nCut the beat off.\n\n02:04.440 --> 02:05.440\nWhat is MC Gunn?\n\n02:05.440 --> 02:15.440\nControl, think about eating pussy.\n\n02:15.440 --> 02:16.440\nYeah.\n\n02:16.440 --> 02:17.440\nGun control.\n\n02:17.440 --> 02:18.440\nYeah.\n\n02:18.440 --> 02:19.440\nNo, I'm sorry.\n\n02:19.440 --> 02:20.440\nYeah.\n\n02:20.440 --> 02:21.440\nAll right.\n\n02:21.440 --> 02:22.440\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n02:22.440 --> 02:23.440\nGod damn it.\n\n02:23.440 --> 02:30.440\nLike, you know, all the fantasies you have in your head of like, let's start doing the\n\n02:30.440 --> 02:31.440\npodcast again.\n\n02:31.440 --> 02:32.440\nThat just all goes to shit.\n\n02:32.440 --> 02:37.440\nIn the first five seconds, do this, do that.\n\n02:37.440 --> 02:38.440\nWell, now we did it.\n\n02:38.440 --> 02:40.440\nNow it's all, I'm back to being jaded again.\n\n02:40.440 --> 02:41.440\nOh, no.\n\n02:41.440 --> 02:42.440\nYeah.\n\n02:42.440 --> 02:43.440\nThank you.\n\n02:43.440 --> 02:44.440\nI got engaged.\n\n02:44.440 --> 02:45.440\nYeah.\n\n02:45.440 --> 02:46.440\nIt's so cool.\n\n02:46.440 --> 02:51.440\nI had always said, you know, obviously as a divorcee, like a lot of you kids can't relate\n\n02:51.440 --> 02:52.440\nto this.\n\n02:52.440 --> 02:56.440\nLike, like, I'm sure there are a ton of people in the theater.\n\n02:56.440 --> 03:02.440\nThat are on their third marriage, but it's L.A. after all.\n\n03:02.440 --> 03:04.440\nAnd I endorse you.\n\n03:04.440 --> 03:07.440\nLike, I think, like, use marriage as an expression.\n\n03:07.440 --> 03:09.440\nLike, express yourself.\n\n03:09.440 --> 03:13.440\nLike, let me see what you do when you're eighth marriage.\n\n03:13.440 --> 03:16.440\nBut I think the typical person is like, no, marriage is for keeps.\n\n03:16.440 --> 03:19.440\nAnd that's why I hate it or I love it or whatever.\n\n03:19.440 --> 03:22.440\nI never saw myself as a divorcee.\n\n03:22.440 --> 03:27.440\nI loved my wife.\n\n03:27.440 --> 03:32.440\nLike, I proposed to my lovely, lovely wife, my partner, my best friend.\n\n03:32.440 --> 03:38.440\nWe were together for a probably record minimum amount of time before we were like, whoa,\n\n03:38.440 --> 03:39.440\nmistake.\n\n03:39.440 --> 03:45.440\nAnd, but I always, I was like, I would say to Cody, like, look, you want to put a ring\n\n03:45.440 --> 03:46.440\non this finger, like do it.\n\n03:46.440 --> 03:51.440\nBut the one thing I can't do is be like, will you also marry me?\n\n03:51.440 --> 03:57.440\nThat seems problematic because it's like the proposal is coming from the one guy that's\n\n03:57.440 --> 04:04.440\nlike, look, you're already established that your opinion of who should be married is flawed.\n\n04:04.440 --> 04:09.440\nIs this logic not tracking?\n\n04:09.440 --> 04:12.440\nLike, don't get married and then get divorced.\n\n04:12.440 --> 04:17.440\nMy therapist said the same thing, which is not really because it's disrespecting your\n\n04:17.440 --> 04:18.440\ncut.\n\n04:18.440 --> 04:22.440\nI'm like, well, no, fucking, you got to do it this time.\n\n04:22.440 --> 04:25.440\nBut Cody proposed to you on this one, right?\n\n04:25.440 --> 04:26.440\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n04:26.440 --> 04:27.440\nYeah.\n\n04:27.440 --> 04:29.440\nIs that I'm like, yeah, I'll hold out for that.\n\n04:29.440 --> 04:31.440\nDoes she like get down on the knee into the whole thing?\n\n04:31.440 --> 04:32.440\nYeah, she did.\n\n04:32.440 --> 04:33.440\nShe almost drowned.\n\n04:33.440 --> 04:38.440\nIt was because it was in Tahini and she was, she picked her spot and she did the thing and\n\n04:38.440 --> 04:43.440\nshe had rehearsed it and she was up to her neck in water and she proposed to me.\n\n04:43.440 --> 04:47.440\nI knew it was coming eventually, but I didn't know it was coming there.\n\n04:47.440 --> 04:50.440\nAre you going to take the name Heller or are you going to keep Harmon?\n\n04:50.440 --> 04:57.440\nI think, selfishly, I would like to take the name Heller because I would like to die.\n\n04:57.440 --> 05:00.440\nI've been through this whole thing.\n\n05:00.440 --> 05:02.440\nI consider this very therapeutic.\n\n05:02.440 --> 05:11.440\nLike, a woman got down on her knee and said, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub.\n\n05:11.440 --> 05:12.440\nWould you marry me?\n\n05:12.440 --> 05:17.440\nAnd I was like, only fuck, I knew this was happening, I knew this was happening.\n\n05:17.440 --> 05:20.440\nAnd then I'm like, holy shit, it's happening now.\n\n05:20.440 --> 05:26.440\nAnd then I'm like, honestly, to be honest and share with you, this is not a binary decision\n\n05:26.440 --> 05:27.440\nyou make.\n\n05:27.440 --> 05:33.440\nHowever, it gets reduced if somebody says to you at the halftime show of a thing.\n\n05:33.440 --> 05:37.440\nYou're like, the alternative is no, I won't marry you.\n\n05:37.440 --> 05:41.440\nThere's a little bit of a push there where you're like, yeah, of course.\n\n05:41.440 --> 05:43.440\nFirst and foremost, yes and.\n\n05:43.440 --> 05:48.440\nBut there's a processor in the back of your head where you're like, what's happening?\n\n05:48.440 --> 05:50.440\nHow is this going to work?\n\n05:50.440 --> 05:53.440\nSo your UCB training kicked in at this point?\n\n05:53.440 --> 05:54.440\nOf course.\n\n05:54.440 --> 05:56.440\nI think everyone's UCB training kicks in.\n\n05:56.440 --> 05:58.440\nEveryone doesn't need UCB training.\n\n05:58.440 --> 06:02.440\nThat was the start of a thing in my Tahitian vacation where I was like in the background,\n\n06:02.440 --> 06:04.440\nI didn't share this with Cody at all.\n\n06:04.440 --> 06:09.440\nI shared it with my therapist, but I was like, every day since I said yes to this proposal,\n\n06:09.440 --> 06:12.440\nI had been confronting this anxiety.\n\n06:12.440 --> 06:17.440\nOr I was like, a woman just proposed to you and you said yes.\n\n06:17.440 --> 06:19.440\nAnd what have you given up?\n\n06:19.440 --> 06:20.440\nWhat are you doing?\n\n06:20.440 --> 06:21.440\nWhat's going on?\n\n06:21.440 --> 06:27.440\nAnd it made me kind of like go through these thoughts in my head where I was like, well,\n\n06:27.440 --> 06:31.440\nfirst of all, now I can get as fat as I want.\n\n06:31.440 --> 06:38.440\nBut then counter that I was like, no, you now have to get thinner than you've ever been.\n\n06:38.440 --> 06:43.440\nThere's a voice from down here somewhere where he's not saying anything that I disagree with,\n\n06:43.440 --> 06:50.440\nbut your license to speak is too liberal.\n\n06:50.440 --> 06:52.440\nCurtail it.\n\n06:52.440 --> 06:54.440\nIt's distracting me.\n\n06:54.440 --> 07:00.440\nBut even though you're saying exactly everything I'm thinking, fuck you, silence.\n\n07:00.440 --> 07:05.440\nFree speech zone is in my butt.\n\n07:05.440 --> 07:07.440\nGet up my butt, sir.\n\n07:07.440 --> 07:09.440\nI started thinking in my head.\n\n07:09.440 --> 07:14.440\nIt was like an emotional thing where I was like, oh shit, when a guy proposes to a woman,\n\n07:14.440 --> 07:21.440\nthe guy, it doesn't matter, remove all of your politics about who pays for what and all this stuff.\n\n07:21.440 --> 07:29.440\nThe bottom line is that a guy is thinking about it and then buying a ring, which is what Cody had to do.\n\n07:29.440 --> 07:34.440\nAnd it's just that power of when you hit the buzzer.\n\n07:34.440 --> 07:36.440\nI knew Cody was going to propose to me.\n\n07:36.440 --> 07:37.440\nI was in love with her.\n\n07:37.440 --> 07:38.440\nI wanted her to propose to me.\n\n07:38.440 --> 07:39.440\nI didn't know it was going to happen then.\n\n07:39.440 --> 07:49.440\nBut that makes it no, like, it was like, she gets to hit the buzzer in the game show of like, we're married.\n\n07:49.440 --> 07:52.440\nShe told me, she's like, should I?\n\n07:52.440 --> 07:55.440\nI don't want to hear that you got to weigh in.\n\n07:55.440 --> 07:56.440\nThat's awful.\n\n07:56.440 --> 07:58.440\nI told her don't do it.\n\n07:58.440 --> 08:00.440\nOkay, all right.\n\n08:00.440 --> 08:05.440\nBut it was like, and I was like, there was this thing of anxiety hanging over me.\n\n08:05.440 --> 08:10.440\nI don't know how much of it had to do with the fact that like, look, I've been married and I fucked it up.\n\n08:10.440 --> 08:11.440\nI don't know how to do this.\n\n08:11.440 --> 08:13.440\nWhat would you have proposed to her if she hadn't done it?\n\n08:13.440 --> 08:15.440\nWell, I don't know if I would have.\n\n08:15.440 --> 08:18.440\nI told her, I told everybody within shouting range.\n\n08:18.440 --> 08:21.440\nI was like, look, I love marriage.\n\n08:21.440 --> 08:24.440\nSo I proposed to my ex-wife.\n\n08:24.440 --> 08:26.440\nIt didn't work out so good.\n\n08:26.440 --> 08:34.440\nTherefore, what right do I have to, it felt like, it's like, what does it mean for me to get out?\n\n08:34.440 --> 08:40.440\nWhat does it mean for me to get on one knee and say, hey, you know what?\n\n08:40.440 --> 08:42.440\nI got a feeling.\n\n08:42.440 --> 08:44.440\nThis one's blue.\n\n08:44.440 --> 08:49.440\nIt's sort of like, to me, there's an elephant in that room where it's like, yeah, but what do you know?\n\n08:49.440 --> 08:51.440\nYou're divorced.\n\n08:51.440 --> 08:57.440\nYou're the one guy in this exchange that doesn't know whether or not you should be proposing to someone.\n\n08:57.440 --> 08:58.440\nYou already did it.\n\n08:58.440 --> 09:01.440\nAnd it was always an open joke between me and Cody.\n\n09:01.440 --> 09:04.440\nAnd she was like, what if I ever proposed to you?\n\n09:04.440 --> 09:06.440\nI'm like, the day you proposed to me, you get an automatic guess.\n\n09:06.440 --> 09:07.440\nI love you.\n\n09:07.440 --> 09:09.440\nI want to be with you for the rest of my life.\n\n09:09.440 --> 09:14.440\nBut that's sort of what all couples are, in a sense.\n\n09:14.440 --> 09:21.440\nHopefully, there's not a lot of couples where someone's like, by the way, shoulder get off the pot.\n\n09:21.440 --> 09:23.440\nAnd it's like, oh, fuck, oh, god.\n\n09:23.440 --> 09:28.440\nWe perceive it that way, but the truth is that it's more of a continuum.\n\n09:28.440 --> 09:35.440\nAnd so that's why I said, of course I said yes, because of course the answer is yes.\n\n09:35.440 --> 09:44.440\nAnd then for the next two days, unbeknownst to Cody, I was sort of like, in my head, it was like, why do I feel uneasy?\n\n09:44.440 --> 09:51.440\nAnd the answer is, because this wasn't, I didn't, I'm missing the way you miss your wallet or your keys.\n\n09:51.440 --> 09:53.440\nI'm missing my agency.\n\n09:53.440 --> 09:57.440\nIt's not like this isn't what I wanted.\n\n09:57.440 --> 09:59.440\nIt's just that I didn't.\n\n09:59.440 --> 10:05.440\nI'm like, I've been shocked, like, cord of like something that doesn't protect me anyway.\n\n10:05.440 --> 10:06.440\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n10:06.440 --> 10:08.440\nI didn't want it, but I was like, it's gone.\n\n10:08.440 --> 10:11.440\nI didn't even know I wanted it.\n\n10:11.440 --> 10:13.440\nAnd then I started to think in my head.\n\n10:13.440 --> 10:15.440\nI was like, why don't you run through some exercises?\n\n10:15.440 --> 10:18.440\nLike, what's your worst nightmare?\n\n10:18.440 --> 10:22.440\nI was like, OK, well, I've been taken.\n\n10:22.440 --> 10:26.440\nSo it's my job to serve this woman for the rest of my life.\n\n10:26.440 --> 10:28.440\nAnd that actually kind of made me start.\n\n10:28.440 --> 10:33.440\nLike, I was sort of like, like, I was thinking in my head, it was like, what if you were like property?\n\n10:33.440 --> 10:35.440\nWhat if you had been taken?\n\n10:35.440 --> 10:36.440\nWhat if you had no agency?\n\n10:36.440 --> 10:40.440\nWhat if somebody had looked at you and said, I want that?\n\n10:40.440 --> 10:45.440\nAnd you were like, OK, I'll, OK, I'll let you take that.\n\n10:45.440 --> 10:47.440\nAnd like, I don't want you to leave me.\n\n10:47.440 --> 10:55.440\nSo I guess I'd better be on my toes from now on, as opposed to this other.\n\n10:55.440 --> 10:58.440\nI wonder if any woman here could relate to that feeling.\n\n10:58.440 --> 10:59.440\nThat's my point.\n\n10:59.440 --> 11:00.440\nI was sort of like in doses.\n\n11:00.440 --> 11:03.440\nI was sort of like subjecting myself.\n\n11:03.440 --> 11:11.440\nAnd the more I pushed the weird dystopian narrative where it was like, what if you actually were just a slave?\n\n11:11.440 --> 11:12.440\nWhat if you were a servant?\n\n11:12.440 --> 11:13.440\nWhat is your nightmare?\n\n11:13.440 --> 11:14.440\nWhat is the worst thing?\n\n11:14.440 --> 11:17.440\nWhat do we fear about?\n\n11:17.440 --> 11:19.440\nWhat do these symbols represent?\n\n11:19.440 --> 11:21.440\nRing on your finger.\n\n11:21.440 --> 11:22.440\nLike, ring on my finger.\n\n11:22.440 --> 11:23.440\nI'm doing this.\n\n11:23.440 --> 11:24.440\nI take

you\n\n32:52.720 --> 32:58.560\nloose against each other like like when Nabisco says to half the population or\n\n32:58.560 --> 33:02.520\n30% of the population hey welcome to a new white chocolate\n\n33:02.520 --> 33:09.400\nligerian experience like they don't say hey do you like white chocolate it will\n\n33:09.400 --> 33:13.640\ntake your money give us a subscription to chocolate and if you want to make\n\n33:13.640 --> 33:18.360\nsure it's white fight the people that like regular chocolate just fight them\n\n33:18.360 --> 33:21.160\nfor it because it's first come first served I'm almost certain this metaphor\n\n33:21.160 --> 33:27.640\nholds up like it's the airline industry is the only sheltered totally non\n\n33:27.640 --> 33:32.320\ncapitalistic like fucking sheltered weird biodome where a class of society is\n\n33:32.320 --> 33:36.400\nallowed to you're just afraid of flying just say that I can it be both why can't\n\n33:36.400 --> 33:39.600\nit be both by the way

34:14.720\nterrified but that's not being crammed into a small space with other people but\n\n34:14.720 --> 34:19.140\nalso he's being oppressed by corporate entities that are conspiring to fuck\n\n34:19.140 --> 34:24.600\nAmerica never see that dance before they are hurting people they're beating\n\n34:24.600 --> 34:28.920\nthem up and killing animals they tased a man and punched his face until his\n\n34:28.920 --> 34:32.760\nface was bleeding and dragged him off a plane and the corporation that did that\n\n34:32.760 --> 34:37.520\nis doing just as much business as they're legally

it takes your guardian away if I told the story before about the time I\n\n43:32.640 --> 43:37.120\nthought we were gonna crash in a plane my friend Frank maybe but dude I think we\n\n43:37.120 --> 43:42.080\nshould hear it I'm gonna pour a drink will you tell it the the theme of the\n\n43:42.080 --> 43:47.920\nstory was that you're amazing and you don't fear death no yeah I'll take you\n\n43:47.920 --> 43:52.200\nto the very end of it it was like we were gonna land in Chicago we couldn't\n\n43:52.200 --> 43:56.200\nso we went to Indiana if I told the story a thousand times I think just once\n\n43:56.200 --> 44:03.120\nin the very end it was the women that were the flight attendants that were\n\n44:03.120 --> 44:07.920\non board that made everybody feel safe and we felt secure and happy because\n\n44:07.920 --> 44:11.840\nthese women that were like veteran like flight attendants have been through it\n\n44:11.840 --> 44:17.240\nall we go if they're not nervous we're not nervous and when we landed the\n\n44:17.240 --> 44:25.920\nwoman came on the comm and said we're back in Indiana oh my god and that's\n\n44:25.920 --> 44:33.960\nwhen that's when we all shit our pants because like oh she was nervous too like\n\n44:33.960 --> 44:37.960\nlike she we we all thought we're gonna die we thought she didn't think we were\n\n44:37.960 --> 44:41.320\ngonna die right then we found out she thought we were going to die and she is\n\n44:41.320 --> 44:45.640\na fucking badass like she's John Wayne from fucking the like the longest day\n\n44:45.640 --> 44:51.600\nlike we're all we all thought we were gonna die and she told us so at the\n\n44:51.600 --> 44:58.240\nvery end oh god damn it let it go it's the kid let it go okay this is a nice\n\n44:58.240 --> 45:05.360\nsegue into our next segment which is Dan recommends podcast yeah do you know\n\n45:05.360 --> 45:13.680\nthe etymology of the word posh night I know I thought it was a spice it's an\n\n45:13.680 --> 45:19.280\nacronym mm-hmm I listen in this new true crying podcast that's two British\n\n45:19.280 --> 45:27.840\nladies and one of them shared this posh is an acronym for in in the olden days\n\n45:27.840 --> 45:33.920\nwhen getting too much Sun was a definite gateway to being perceived as poor and\n\n45:33.920 --> 45:41.280\npeople started to travel by boat like as an upper-class thing you it was about\n\n45:41.280 --> 45:45.240\nthe strategy of when to keep the Sun on your face and when to keep it off your\n\n45:45.240 --> 45:52.600\nface posh stands for port side over starboard home it's the side of the boat\n\n45:52.600 --> 45:57.800\nthat you sit on you don't want to get too much of a tan wait across crossing\n\n45:57.800 --> 46:00.720\nover from England side over to the continent to wherever you're going so\n\n46:00.720 --> 46:06.840\nleft side going out right home to keep the Sun off you I guess right that\n\n46:06.840 --> 46:12.000\nwould be the shady side of the product yes that's one of those things like\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:19.800\nwhere people what is crazy spice stands for and that segues me into like my\n\n46:19.800 --> 46:24.000\nsignal boost podcast of the like I've listened to so many true crime podcasts\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:28.920\nbut like I can't like like I found this one red-handed it's these two British\n\n46:28.920 --> 46:36.920\nladies and I like in the height of my enthusiasm for them I'll give them the\n\n46:36.920 --> 46:42.560\noffer that I've given to David Cummings to come out was like sheroody and Hannah\n\n46:42.560 --> 46:47.880\nif if this gets back to you and you want to fly first class to the states and\n\n46:47.880 --> 46:52.360\ngonna be a guest on the show like I'll like worth it you've given me so much\n\n46:52.360 --> 46:55.600\nlike I'd love to chat with you also any of our fans if you want to come out\n\n46:55.600 --> 47:00.680\nfirst-class damn I'm gonna pay for you no not not

when true crime is gonna hit its peak I\n\n47:09.680 --> 47:13.840\nthink it's so funny like I just me and Cody listen to true crime podcasts it's\n\n47:13.840 --> 47:18.640\nall we do we gobble them up we run out of everyone and like every single one is\n\n47:18.640 --> 47:24.560\non a different podcast network and every single podcast network has advertisements\n\n47:24.560 --> 47:28.000\nfor different ones where they're like hey just a couple words from some of our\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:32.280\nfriends I was like I can't it seems like there's got to be more true crime\n\n47:32.280 --> 47:36.920\npodcasts than there are people willing to listen or that have ever been murdered\n\n47:36.920 --> 47:42.400\nby anything it's so but I haven't hit my peak I just keep going all right let's\n\n47:42.400 --> 47:46.720\nlisten to them like these advertisements the one thing that's really funny to me\n\n47:46.720 --> 47:53.040\nis I kind of want to grab people and shake them and go please stop pretending\n\n47:53.040 --> 48:02.160\nthis isn't ghoulish I guess the new wave is like hey we're gonna talk about true\n\n48:02.160 --> 48:06.800\ncrime you're gonna hear about strangulation and rape and murder but\n\n48:06.800 --> 48:13.320\nit's because victims need not be forgotten like like they put this twist on\n\n48:13.320 --> 48:16.640\nit where it's like we're doing a service I'm like well maybe you are maybe you're\n\n48:16.640 --> 48:22.240\nnot but come on that's not what this come on I mean I'll go to sleep on my\n\n48:22.240 --> 48:26.000\ncouch and watch some date lines but I cannot do the Keith Morrison the fucking\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:32.120\nguy I fucking want to I feel I feel like I feel like like perfectly good about\n\n48:32.120 --> 48:38.520\npeople that are like oh well we should make sure I'm going to keep doing my\n\n48:38.520 --> 48:44.240\nKeith Morrison that's wonderful but is is it good to do a Keith\n\n48:44.240 --> 48:49.440\nMorrison passion while Dan Harmon is talking yeah we don't know maybe it's\n\n48:49.440 --> 48:59.840\nnot I listen to the world may know I've been listening to this podcast called the\n\n48:59.840 --> 49:04.160\ndream podcast and I recommend it highly it's about multi-level marketing and how\n\n49:04.160 --> 49:09.600\nit affects people and it's crazy it's apparently all a big scam the only\n\n49:09.600 --> 49:13.560\nreason it's still around today is because there's this big court case that\n\n49:13.560 --> 49:17.840\nthe people were about to go to jail but they have like deep ties to like the\n\n49:17.840 --> 49:20.760\ngovernment and stuff so they kind of like got the court case thrown out and\n\n49:20.760 --> 49:24.560\nthen in that court case they were like well check it out here's the rules for\n\n49:24.560 --> 49:29.400\nwhat is an isn't a multi-level marketing scam and we don't do that so we're in\n\n49:29.400 --> 49:32.760\nthe clear and they're like yep you're in the clear and then it turned out they\n\n49:32.760 --> 49:37.120\nmade up those rules to prove that they didn't and no one has rules on what is\n\n49:37.120 --> 49:41.160\nthere isn't a multi-leveling scam so like that's now the new legal definition is\n\n49:41.160 --> 49:46.360\nwhat the MLMs like made to be to avoid and they're like we aren't that and\n\n49:46.360 --> 49:50.640\nthat's why we're not breaking the law but it's just fundamentally a fraud by\n\n49:50.640 --> 49:54.880\nthe mechanics of the business itself and the only reason that it can't always\n\n49:54.880 --> 49:59.080\nbe prosecuted is because there's not always sufficient evidence to prosecute\n\n49:59.080 --> 50:02.560\nbusinesses of stuff but it's all fundamentally a fraud and it's crazy\n\n50:02.560 --> 50:06.400\nbecause it's like it's all this crazy capitalist stuff where everyone's just\n\n50:06.400 --> 50:10.240\nlike preying on people as a business and it gets into like sexism because\n\n50:10.240 --> 50:13.600\nthere's all these men who pray on women and get them involved and so they're\n\n50:13.600 --> 50:18.000\nmaking men money for the men but it like it's secret and so it's like this weird\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:22.000\nthing that affects like women and I don't know it just it takes money out of\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:25.400\nboth sides of the family it's just this really insidious thing that seemed to\n\n50:25.400 --> 50:29.920\ncompletely grasp all of American business and now American politics and it's\n\n50:29.920 --> 50:34.480\nit's I don't know it's like you find out like every problem we have is kind of\n\n50:34.480 --> 50:38.120\nall connected to the same problems and it's like holy shit to the idea that we\n\n50:38.120 --> 50:43.400\nwe aren't able to recognize what is essentially a not even capitalism it's\n\n50:43.400 --> 50:46.360\nlike a pyramid scheme or yeah well that's the thing is that like the\n\n50:46.360 --> 50:49.680\nmulti-level market at the marketing companies that have gotten away with it\n\n50:49.680 --> 50:54.080\nfor so long\n\n50:54.080 --> 51:01.760\nbut basically we could make that work we just need to keep it rolling for a long\n\n51:01.760 --> 51:07.960\ndon't make it yeah no I know I'm trying I'm trying to be helpful no but I hit\n\n51:07.960 --> 51:18.320\nthe thing my accent no no I believe it I lost my turn of thought anyway you you\n\n51:18.320 --> 51:21.960\nburden of proof is on you to prove that you're not just jealous of Spencer\n\n51:21.960 --> 51:29.080\ntaking the conch no I was trying to look for it the the DND theme in case we\n\n51:29.080 --> 51:32.280\nwant to play yeah that makes some well that actually now brings to mind like\n\n51:32.280 --> 51:35.720\nyou were gonna do that and it was gonna kind of you that was Spencer face you\n\n51:35.720 --> 51:39.320\nwere gonna commit Spencer face I was I was scrolling through and I hit the I hit\n\n51:39.320 --> 51:53.120\nthe wrong thing you back me up on this airline thing oh yeah I was just trying\n\n51:53.120 --> 51:57.760\nto do my job as a control that one's good okay look here's the thing it's\n\n51:57.760 --> 52:03.280\n2019 like I'm not a big resolution guy but like something that like I've been\n\n52:03.280 --> 52:08.640\nreally remiss about we've been as we've gone on we love doing this podcast it's\n\n52:08.640 --> 52:13.040\namazing we've concretized it we've incorporated it whatever we're trying\n\n52:13.040 --> 52:18.240\nto make it like a self-sufficient like little bio dome of like pod castry\n\n52:18.240 --> 52:22.400\neverybody that works on it hopefully is getting paid to work on it part of part\n\n52:22.400 --> 52:26.360\nof that was like coming up with paperwork and signing contracts it's an arduous\n\n52:26.360 --> 52:30.320\nprocess takes the joy out of everything of course you can't just like do\n\n52:30.320 --> 52:35.480\nsomething for fun and someone's gonna get end up getting fucked over we we've\n\n52:35.480 --> 52:39.640\nbeen trying for years now like we like oh it's our business it's Harmontown\n\n52:39.640 --> 52:44.480\nincorporated and give this to that person give that the last person along the\n\n52:44.480 --> 52:48.720\nway I think one of the funnier things it's like one of our silent partners\n\n52:48.720 --> 52:54.560\nKevin Day who runs the ins and outs of like you know like like pumping the\n\n52:54.560 --> 53:00.280\nshow out he's he's like I don't I don't want to I don't want to make him a\n\n53:00.280 --> 53:04.000\ntarget but he's pretty Bitcoin rich he's like kind of like he doesn't really\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:08.080\nneed the five the bottom line is like at what a certain point during the\n\n53:08.080 --> 53:13.920\nincorporation of the podcast he's sort of like yeah I have a problem I I need\n\n53:13.920 --> 53:18.080\nsome of the money to go away like like and we came up with this thing Kevin can\n\n53:18.080 --> 53:33.000\nyou can you come up can you come up and talk about our thing so we had talked\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:37.440\nabout like because basically like if you were to do nothing at all given your\n\n53:37.440 --> 53:42.040\nsituation if you're taking money from the business venture that we had to\n\n53:42.040 --> 53:45.760\ncreate in order to make the thing you would get penalized that's this is a\n\n53:45.760 --> 53:50.040\ncommon theme of capitalism yes you need a write-off you need a thing and you're\n\n53:50.040 --> 53:53.520\nlike look here's this here's something that we can't do both ethically and\n\n53:53.520 --> 53:58.600\nlegally we can't say to our podcast audience if you subscribe to the podcast\n\n53:58.600 --> 54:05.240\nsome of your money will go to take care of Down syndrome which many podcasts do\n\n54:05.240 --> 54:08.960\nbut is illegal I think well whether it's illegal or not I don't actually know\n\n54:08.960 --> 54:12.880\nabout the legality of it but I do know that actually as a as a pseudo\n\n54:12.880 --> 54:18.640\ncapitalist I would actually say honestly you know if you're asking someone for\n\n54:18.640 --> 54:24.200\nfive dollars shouldn't they have a choice as to whether or not one of their\n\n54:24.200 --> 54:30.880\nfive dollars goes to this or that but but what we came upon was like you're\n\n54:30.880 --> 54:34.640\nyou're gonna suffer in silence unless we give some of your money away every\n\n54:34.640 --> 54:39.440\nmonth correct and so we came up with this idea it's like let's pick a charity\n\n54:39.440 --> 54:43.400\nevery month and we can renew it at the end of every month but let's pick let's\n\n54:43.400 --> 54:48.000\npick something that your money goes to because you don't need it and you need\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:51.600\nto write it off let's just get it out of your hands so you don't get penalized\n\n54:51.600 --> 54:55.700\nfor it right like what I really wanted to do was like what other podcasts do was\n\n54:55.700 --> 54:59.240\nsay that we were gonna donate 10% of whatever to some charity and as you\n\n54:59.240 --> 55:03.400\nbrought up that's a really bad idea because people might cancel you know\n\n55:03.400 --> 55:06.440\nthey don't want to subscribe yeah I would like to think that there is such a\n\n55:06.440 --> 55:10.480\nthing as a Republican Harmontown fan who's like look I don't truck with this\n\n55:10.480 --> 55:16.280\nor that but like don't don't put me in a position where I feel like literally my\n\n55:16.280 --> 55:21.360\nmoney helps something that I don't believe in if they want to listen to me\n\n55:21.360 --> 55:25.040\nto say they're stupid and pay five dollars like that should be there right\n\n55:25.040 --> 55:29.720\nyeah right feels like an ethical thing to me it's where ethics and capitalism\n\n55:29.720 --> 55:34.360\nintersect so and so and so I think the nice thing is that we go look this is a\n\n55:34.360 --> 55:39.920\nif you're if you're a right-wing person and you're like I don't want my money\n\n55:39.920 --> 55:43.480\ngoing to anything but trust me your money's going to me and Jeff getting\n\n55:43.480 --> 55:53.560\ndrunk and dying I promise anything left over where it's it's it's supposed it's\n\n55:53.560 --> 55:59.280\ngoing to a private citizen who's our silent partner Kevin Day Kevin now who\n\n55:59.280 --> 56:03.560\nhas no political affiliation he doesn't care he what he said to me is he's\n\n56:03.560 --> 56:07.720\nwilling to we're going to find a charity eat every once in a while we're going to\n\n56:07.720 --> 56:11.000\nfunnel your money into that charity right I'm donating the money but I'm\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:18.080\nletting Dan pick where it goes okay it's all going to the Proud Boys they just\n\n56:18.080 --> 56:24.720\nthey just if they could read they they just not fair what's happening we try\n\n56:24.720 --> 56:32.080\nto represent the now we will do it now we are gonna it's too late now we're\n\n56:32.080 --> 56:39.280\ngiving the money to the Proud Boys for real I honestly do think as a side\n\n56:39.280 --> 56:42.160\nargument that that's probably the quickest way to diffuse some of these\n\n56:42.160 --> 56:46.800\npockets of toxic dudes is that you actually just give them a million dollars\n\n56:46.800 --> 56:50.040\nbecause the wouldn't they just it would be Sierra Madre they would just kill\n\n56:50.040 --> 56:55.680\neach other going I want this big of a flesh like no it should be like they'd\n\n56:55.680 --> 56:59.560\nbe like no it's too dark I want it to be whiter and they'll be like fuck you\n\n56:59.560 --> 57:04.840\nracist they just like you could give give bad people a million dollars they're\n\n57:04.840 --> 57:10.920\ntoast but we're not doing that I here's my my thing that I've always been\n\n57:10.920 --> 57:14.320\npassionate about always been passionate about giant air quotes because I do\n\n57:14.320 --> 57:19.080\nnothing to do anything but like maybe this mechanism could help us or I said\n\n57:19.080 --> 57:23.760\nto you prison reform this is the thing that I'm like really like kind of like\n\n57:23.760 --> 57:32.600\nI because I feel like it's like easy to not do like I feel awful about the fact\n\n57:32.600 --> 57:37.120\nthat we when somebody fucks up in life I don't care how bad they are I don't\n\n57:37.120 --> 57:39.760\ncare how evil they are it's not about whether you're a good person or bad\n\n57:39.760 --> 57:45.080\nperson if you end up in our system like where we have decided as a society this\n\n57:45.080 --> 57:49.640\nis how it works I don't like the fact that you get locked up and then your\n\n57:49.640 --> 57:53.920\nnightmare begins and that and that you're like deprived of shit that like\n\n57:53.920 --> 57:58.720\nmaybe could help you like I don't I like like I don't like that you can't get\n\n57:58.720 --> 58:02.680\nD&D books in prison I don't like that you I don't I don't I don't like that we\n\n58:02.680 --> 58:05.960\njoke about oh well where you're going you're gonna get raped every day and\n\n58:05.960 --> 58:09.560\nit's like well that one's not part of the judge's sentence but I just in\n\n58:09.560 --> 58:14.400\ngeneral I think we have like a fucked up twisted idea of like it's like if we're\n\n58:14.400 --> 58:20.840\na society that's gonna lock up almost all the people in the world like it\n\n58:20.840 --> 58:26.160\nthat's my thing I realized so I told you that like two hours ago I was like look\n\n58:26.160 --> 58:32.400\nup prison reform yes and so we may pick a charity tonight where we're like sounds\n\n58:32.400 --> 58:36.840\nlike this alright here's where Kevin Day's money is going and on the reddit\n\n58:36.840 --> 58:42.520\nyou may go I looked them up they're terrible they're fake okay let's find\n\n58:42.520 --> 58:47.400\nthat out in real time let's let's let's popularize the idea of charity shopping\n\n58:47.400 --> 58:54.120\nso I came down to two options I wanted to give you the first is the probably more\n\n58:54.120 --> 58:57.120\nwell-known and much bigger but not exactly what you were asking for is\n\n58:57.120 --> 59:01.240\ncalled the innocence project right and their job is mostly they do to people\n\n59:01.240 --> 59:04.640\nwho basically everybody looks at and goes there's no way this person was\n\n59:04.640 --> 59:09.160\nguilty but they're sat with a life prison prison sentence they don't you know\n\n59:09.160 --> 59:14.360\nget sentences overturned and right they're very big and they also need to\n\n59:14.360 --> 59:17.080\nbe one of the most effective charities and they've they've regularly been\n\n59:17.080 --> 59:22.920\nrecognized for dollars going to them does the most good I don't want to okay\n\n59:22.920 --> 59:27.920\ngut thank you for yeah I'm is I am actually more invested in like how do\n\n59:27.920 --> 59:34.360\nwe treat like the bad people I I want the guilty people to not have to like in\n\n59:34.360 --> 59:39.360\naddition to doing their time and serving there so I would like it if they could\n\n59:39.360 --> 59:44.240\nlike fucking learn a trade and like and like not live in fear but yes I love\n\n59:44.240 --> 59:49.000\nthe innocence project obviously and arguably a great thing but right so the\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.800\none closer I think what you're asking for is a similar project called the\n\n59:51.800 --> 59:57.080\nsentencing project that seems to have two goals one is to give make sure people\n\n59:57.080 --> 01:00:01.040\nget fair sentences because too often people are you know thrown in some\n\n01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.520\nmaximum security prison for something that was not needed and second that one\n\n01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.200\nof their goals is while people are incarcerated making sure that prisons\n\n01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:14.440\nare not more likely to produce good results and people are let out you know\n\n01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:19.040\nmaking sure things are not cruel making sure education is available making sure\n\n01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.000\nthat you know job training is made available and things like that so they\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.600\nsort of seem to have a two-pronged approach of make sure people's sentences\n\n01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.760\nare appropriate how do they do that in a world where it's like state-to-state\n\n01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:36.480\ncity-to-city like how do they um from the literal five minutes I've read about\n\n01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.480\nthem that's part of the joke is that I made you do this because I'm so\n\n01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:48.160\ncharitable that I'm like this lazy they meet with district attorneys a lot they\n\n01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.520\nhave provided information to states and counties and things like that about you\n\n01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.360\nknow are you aware of the sentencing guidelines you guys have and what that\n\n01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.440\nproduces and how this person here because of the guidelines that that\n\n01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:06.000\nexist in this jurisdiction result in a 20-year maximum security you never see\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.920\nyour friends the entire time you're in jail when other states are doing things\n\n01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.960\nmore fairly and here's how well this has worked and here you know so they\n\n01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.640\npresent information to the people who make sentencing decisions to allow them\n\n01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.280\nsome of the visibility they may not see themselves it's like an awareness thing\n\n01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:26.880\nalmost where they're like hey judge hang them high yes and hey a prosecuting\n\n01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:31.540\nattorney hang them high like you you're getting votes and you're getting\n\n01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.720\npromotions by this idea that you're tough on crime but but it's not working can\n\n01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.240\nwe make you aware of the fact that it's slowly making your city for instance\n\n01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.160\nlike have like recidivism rates that are super high correct and they they've\n\n01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.920\nalso done work to where you know they've taken prisoner complaints that have gone\n\n01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:54.400\nunheard of you know this this policy this prison has is unfair and just mean\n\n01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.520\nspirited for no good reason and they've stepped in they filed lawsuits they've\n\n01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:03.320\nhelped people how do we penetrate that barrier where like once you get locked\n\n01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:09.520\nup everybody outside is like fuck that person and you're like can I get a\n\n01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.480\ntoothbrush and they're like fuck you and then someone's like I want to beat you\n\n01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.800\nup because you're Dan Harmon and you've been locked up and you're like whoa this\n\n01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.360\nisn't part of my sentence and they're like who cares like how can we make\n\n01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:26.720\nprisons less of a nightmare so I can proceed to get locked up I wish I had\n\n01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:30.840\nthe answer yeah I know okay I in the meantime like yeah I guess out of the\n\n01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:36.880\nout of those two the sentencing thing like like sure I guess if those guys\n\n01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:41.680\nhave funding they're gonna be able to talk more to more bureaucrats let's give\n\n01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:48.360\nthem a month or let's say a month because a week is not long enough so it's not\n\n01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.120\nif you're listening to the podcast your money isn't your money isn't going\n\n01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.080\nanywhere your money is going into Harmontown's pocket same as always I'm\n\n01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:02.320\nonly letting you know as part of the show that one of the people that takes\n\n01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.080\nthe money from your pocket after everything's done is gonna get fucked on\n\n01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:12.200\nhis taxes and so he's gonna for this month give it to this random charity which\n\n01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.880\nis called the sentencing projects and we'll maybe at the end of the maybe a\n\n01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.800\nmonth from now we'll go here's how much money we gave them and maybe we'll look\n\n01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.240\ninto it I actually honestly think I'm not putting it on them but I feel like\n\n01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.520\nthe natural mechanism of the reddit kind of mentality is someone's gonna want to\n\n01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.480\ntake this shit down which I think could be a healthy mechanism it's like an\n\n01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.560\nenzyme like they'll research the organization let's find out like\n\n01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.200\ncharities like let's find charities that we that really do great like for\n\n01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.600\nevery every dollar that you give them what are they really doing to change your\n\n01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.080\nhuman life and stuff so let's find ones that we're fans of and this will be the\n\n01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.580\nfirst start of the project like let's not be afraid to do it wrong I some of\n\n01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:56.480\nthe some of that some of the guy that's why I don't even go down that road is\n\n01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.760\nI'm like I don't know what to do like I got high with a guy the other day\n\n01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.880\nexplained to me that Red Cross is like the fucking oh yeah\n\n01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:08.000\nkleptocracy it's crazy it kind of sterilized or paralyzes you charities in\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.400\nAmerica you're like yeah I don't want to do anything yeah you know and like it\n\n01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.880\nshould be the opposite of that it should be like a it should be like your\n\n01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.480\nnatural state should be like yeah whatever you should be kind of exuding\n\n01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:26.720\nshit yeah like in a post-patreon world have you gone

I was like yeah do you want me to explain that sure okay\n\n01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:36.600\nI think I just did but I was there and I didn't get that but damn I got it but I\n\n01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:42.280\nknow what happened already so many a few years ago there was some kind of high\n\n01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.680\nprofile cases where celebrities were getting their iCloud and other accounts\n\n01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:51.120\nhacked and well what these attackers were doing and they were multiple would\n\n01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.840\nthey would break into one person's you know they would guess your iCloud\n\n01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.320\npassword and once they've done that they can download a list of all of your\n\n01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:03.320\ncontacts all of your pictures all of your email a lot of really bad things of\n\n01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:08.120\nDan's you don't want to see look I might take away as Cameron Diaz has me in her\n\n01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:13.320\nphone right so what what happened you know they would break into one person's\n\n01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:17.560\nphone and then from that they would get a whole list of new email addresses and\n\n01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.120\neverything else and they would use that to break into others and break into\n\n01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:25.640\nothers and a friend of mine who owns a bunch of web servers called me one day\n\n01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.120\nand said hey this one web server is acting really weird it's making all\n\n01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.200\nthese connections to iCloud and we can't figure out why and we went and\n\n01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.680\nlooked at it and realized that it was being used to break into other people's\n\n01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.960\naccounts and I had met Dan before and was looking through all the list of\n\n01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:46.520\npeople that it had broken into and I was looking at all of Dan's personal\n\n01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:51.800\ninformation and so reached out to Dan and went you really need to change your\n\n01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:56.760\niCloud password because I got it I got everything yeah yeah what what did you\n\n01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:05.640\nsee everything no I made it a point not to specifically look but just enough to\n\n01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:15.120\nprove that what did you see that picture you was safe don't worry\n\n01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:19.160\nI like to think and I remember calling you when the Sony hack happened I was like\n\n01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:24.560\nKevin yes what is happening with the Sony yeah the North Korean Sony hack\n\n01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:30.120\nwhatever like like I was like I was in a fucking full-blown panic here's why\n\n01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:35.800\nbecause if all of Sony's emails were hacked that that includes every email\n\n01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:41.080\nthat's received by Sony that means that like I didn't know that the press and\n\n01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:47.320\nthat the public was capable of being that like like like that level of\n\n01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:53.600\npiglety like where it was like hey there's no yeah these hackers like dump\n\n01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.680\nto this file online let's walk you through all of it and the way like Amy\n\n01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:00.720\nPascal was like like hung out to dry was like we're actually like what you're\n\n01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:06.560\nproving here is that this this lady that like ran a studio that she made one joke\n\n01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:11.160\nthat was like wouldn't it be off-color if I said this to Obama it's like it's not\n\n01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:17.640\n11 right now by the way great I was like I was like holy shit if one email that I\n\n01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:23.360\never sent to anybody at Sony you like ever gets in the hands of TMZ like I'm\n\n01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.800\nso fucked like it would be such a weird out of context thing and I remember\n\n01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.520\nemailing you and like going like just tell me like I just want to go know if I\n\n01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.280\nneed to go home and blow my brains out and you're like there was one his his\n\n01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:41.680\nemail inbox was deleted at the time but and there's one I did do a search there's\n\n01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:48.640\none reference to you it said that you're you're a wild card it was just like them\n\n01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:53.160\ntalking about me I was like oh it's badass yeah pretty much like a single a\n\n01:08:53.160 --> 01:09:00.000\nsingle email that's notable though because it's like it's not it was like\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.840\nthis thing ethical about that like like look I like I'm just saying like if you\n\n01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:11.400\nprinted an email that I had sent to Sony while I was producing community it\n\n01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:17.600\nwould it would be grounds for like crucifying me I feel by our standards\n\n01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:23.760\nbut it's like I know the word context is now like a dinner bell that's rung by\n\n01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:28.440\nold fat white guys it's like you don't understand but it's like wait a minute\n\n01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:33.240\nlike I the idea that I was a megalomaniac saying to a corporation don't\n\n01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.360\never fucking tell me what to do or I'll fucking punch your teeth down your\n\n01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:40.680\nthroat like like at the time when I was typing that it felt like a really heroic\n\n01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.880\nthing to be typing and six years later the idea that that would be able to be\n\n01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:52.680\npod through by these clearly inscrubulous like oh I'm the rap.org and I'm\n\n01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:58.480\noh I'm banana peel net net like like it was like oh look at what this guy said I\n\n01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.600\nwas like terrified I guess I've been terrified ever since if it helped you\n\n01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:08.720\nsounded more sad than anything there was only one email about you yeah no I don't\n\n01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:23.720\nknow I was relieved believe me and digital and whatever. All right let's go there for Kevin Day everybody. Kevin Day.\n\n01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:30.720\nAnd Dan, what a nice guy for coming up here and sharing his.

01:30:59.040\nthis is gonna sound crazy but in the video you're wearing a ridiculous hat\n\n01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:06.960\nso I thought I bring it around I thought I'd break out another crazy hat and this\n\n01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:11.840\nis pretty crazy this this hat got 5150 but wait Jesse so let me tell you like\n\n01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:19.160\nlike I reference the idea like like so is it is it accurate to say your forced\n\n01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:24.640\ngump adventure begins with this like MTV contest pro like like like but I had a\n\n01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:28.640\nJenny to you know but obviously you had gumption otherwise you wouldn't have won\n\n01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:33.480\nthat contest I did have gumption you beat my friend who was like I had to bubble\n\n01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:39.120\ngum to establish himself as the dick Clark oh yeah I tell you all about that\n\n01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.640\nbecause the media always tries to pit us against each other like they like\n\n01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:49.160\nDuff Lundgren versus still best alone my question is so obviously like Wesley\n\n01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:58.760\nSnipes versus the IRS but coming yeah but coming to that stage yeah obviously\n\n01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:02.560\nwe're already a step and I shot that's crazy you should bring that up Dan we\n\n01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:09.720\nshot a coming to America type movie on the Arsenio Hall to Dave's Eddie Murphy\n\n01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:14.720\nand he played like a guy from Poland and then I was I guess his helper it was\n\n01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:18.760\nvery like black sheep Chris Farley David Spade we made a movie together it's\n\n01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:23.840\nnever gonna come out because that was back when Dave was going through satanic\n\n01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:29.960\nperiod well now he was wick so he didn't show up in half the dailies but\n\n01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:36.280\nnumber two he was also into a really heavy wicker candle period he was making\n\n01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:40.840\ncan we talk about your trousers right yeah I'm sorry for going off the rails\n\n01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:46.800\non a crazy train yeah but these tights but that crazy train leads back to the\n\n01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:54.120\nstation and that station is located in Harmontown yeah I want to know I want to\n\n01:32:54.120 -->

fucking grievous the man but\n\n01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:18.160\nlike like to go to a rock show stole Rod Stewart's girlfriend back in the day he\n\n01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:22.760\nfucking did he fucking did yeah but to go backstage at a rock show with Jesse is\n\n01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:27.560\nlike to be on a magic carpet ride of rock and roll like fucking fantasy well\n\n01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.400\nbecause so here's a question I want to ask you anything why aren't you a snob\n\n01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.840\nbecause you're clearly not a snob because you're not you're not doing a\n\n01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:40.240\nlife humbles me a lot when you because you're like a lot of people who have\n\n01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:44.120\nencyclopedic knowledge of things like yeah they make their bones by going like\n\n01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:50.920\nwell I I talked to you about Phil Collins yeah a lot of people that question but\n\n01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:56.440\nyeah I want to know like like so you're the skeleton key you're like this\n\n01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:01.120\nultimate fan you like that's your charisma those things is there's such a\n\n01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:07.920\nthing as a bad thing for you like don't worry about you I'm talking about as a\n\n01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.920\nconsumer I'm saying okay it's like if I say Phil Collins to you I did a movie with\n\n01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.480\nCharles grown bad move yeah you're you're like Phil Collins he did this he did\n\n01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.340\nthat I say Tori Amos to you yeah I've only said the two things I tell you\n\n01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:26.720\nhonest stories to you is could I say something to you that would make you go\n\n01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:32.320\noh fuck that that's bullshit you know like minuto or like I tell you welcome\n\n01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.040\none thing I'm glad you bring that up one pet peeve of mine although I think the\n\n01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:40.560\npublic definitely cried out against it but it didn't need to be that mean to it\n\n01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:46.120\nbut it was very ill-conceived the Steve Carell movie welcome to Mavine about how\n\n01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:51.560\nhe basically so he's let's just go there with this real quick he is a man that\n\n01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:55.360\nwas at like a like a bar like a rough kind of bar and he was just telling all\n\n01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:01.440\nthe rough locals that he that he got that he wanted to be a cross dresser or\n\n01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:05.360\nsomething and so I

well\n\n01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:23.880\nand then a weird like man like a mr. clean but with a mustache dude Dave\n\n01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:29.760\nKushner nice which is now a marijuana strain what did

oh we're like four like four seats away and I\n\n01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.760\nlook I look over at Jesse and Jesse's looking at me and I go what do you think\n\n01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:48.440\nabout this because it's like 10 minutes to midnight on New Year's Eve and Jesse\n\n01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:56.080\nlooks at me he goes they fucking suck man I go that's what I want I want to hear\n\n01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:00.200\nwhat you think sucks hang on I said I said beautiful boy Steve Carell's other\n\n01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:04.680\nmovie okay I'm gonna just say that no Jesse it may be a beautiful story but\n\n01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:10.000\nlike I don't really find it believable that there is a child born in Marin\n\n01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.280\nCounty California that's addicted to Crystal Street meth don't buy that when\n\n01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:22.760\nAdderall is so readily available I just that's a big leap of faith in the plot\n\n01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:27.440\nthat I really gotta you know but if we're gonna talk about prison reform how\n\n01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:32.120\nunfair the justice system is and how redlined and rigged it is against people\n\n01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:37.760\nof color you know and believe me too it's not you know black lives matter but\n\n01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.920\nit's like when it comes to the poor no lives matter and we as a nation got to\n\n01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:46.000\nlike come up on that and when we do prison reform is part of that you know\n\n01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.440\nbut this is what I'm getting at and I think I remember what I'm getting at\n\n01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:55.840\nand I'm trying to stall right now buffering buffering Jeff I can't believe\n\n01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:02.560\nthat I'm having a senior moment at the age of 39 but it happened no I'm just\n\n01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:07.680\nkidding I'm just being false humble but let me tell you that no I am having a\n\n01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:10.960\nsenior moment it's tough to know I'm going in and out of it but I do remember\n\n01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:16.560\nwe were talking about Amy Grant and how beautiful and wholesome she was kind of\n\n01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:20.400\nlike Tori Amos before all the kids with Dean McDermott can you put Jesse on the\n\n01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.800\non the vocoder like oh yeah but did we get to the punchline of the Velvet\n\n01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.920\nrevolver concert that everyone is so invested in knowing the ending of Jeff\n\n01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:36.440\nI said they I kind of think they suck man and I look down I go like what\n\n01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:40.680\nbecause all this talent is on stage you got all these great rock stars I go
