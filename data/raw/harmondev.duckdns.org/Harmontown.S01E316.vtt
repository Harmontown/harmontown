00:00.000 --> 00:24.760
Let's welcome out our Game Master, Spencer Crittenden to everybody please.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.760
What you got in that bag?

00:27.760 --> 00:32.320
Oh, school supplies and pencil shavings.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.000
Let's bring out a mayor, shall we?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
His name is Dan Harmon.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.000
Happy New Year.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
It's good to be back.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.200
I really missed you guys.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.520
We missed each other.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.440
I missed doing this.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.440
Yay.

00:56.440 --> 00:57.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.440
Oh, keep the beat going.

00:58.440 --> 00:59.440
Keep the beat going.

00:59.440 --> 01:05.440
I really missed doing this as much as your mama's face.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.440
Now cut the beat off.

01:06.440 --> 01:07.440
Cut the beat off.

01:07.440 --> 01:08.440
Okay.

01:08.440 --> 01:09.440
Wait.

01:09.440 --> 01:10.440
Bring the beat back.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.440
Bring the beat back.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.440
Ah, fuck pussy.

01:12.440 --> 01:17.440
Yeah, do it more like an Iron Maiden, like more like rock and roll.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.440
Ah, fuck pussy.

01:18.440 --> 01:35.440
Ah, I get power from the devil when I eat your pussy.

01:35.440 --> 01:44.440
I couldn't be more masculine than I am in the eyes of the awesome ball when I eat your

01:44.440 --> 01:45.440
pussy.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.440
The section of the abdomen that is located in us.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.440
Get out of here, egghead.

01:50.440 --> 01:51.440
I'm sorry.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.440
Ah, pussy.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.440
You invited me to the recording.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.440
Get out of here.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.440
I want to eat pussy.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.440
Now do the iced tea filling like me.

02:00.440 --> 02:01.440
It's not business.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.440
It's personal when I eat your pussy business.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.440
Come on.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.440
Cut the beat off.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.440
What is MC Gunn?

02:05.440 --> 02:15.440
Control, think about eating pussy.

02:15.440 --> 02:16.440
Yeah.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.440
Gun control.

02:17.440 --> 02:18.440
Yeah.

02:18.440 --> 02:19.440
No, I'm sorry.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.440
Yeah.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.440
All right.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.440
Welcome back, everybody.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.440
God damn it.

02:23.440 --> 02:30.440
Like, you know, all the fantasies you have in your head of like, let's start doing the

02:30.440 --> 02:31.440
podcast again.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.440
That just all goes to shit.

02:32.440 --> 02:37.440
In the first five seconds, do this, do that.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.440
Well, now we did it.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.440
Now it's all, I'm back to being jaded again.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.440
Oh, no.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.440
Yeah.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.440
Thank you.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.440
I got engaged.

02:44.440 --> 02:45.440
Yeah.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.440
It's so cool.

02:46.440 --> 02:51.440
I had always said, you know, obviously as a divorcee, like a lot of you kids can't relate

02:51.440 --> 02:52.440
to this.

02:52.440 --> 02:56.440
Like, like, I'm sure there are a ton of people in the theater.

02:56.440 --> 03:02.440
That are on their third marriage, but it's L.A. after all.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.440
And I endorse you.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.440
Like, I think, like, use marriage as an expression.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.440
Like, express yourself.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.440
Like, let me see what you do when you're eighth marriage.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.440
But I think the typical person is like, no, marriage is for keeps.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.440
And that's why I hate it or I love it or whatever.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.440
I never saw myself as a divorcee.

03:22.440 --> 03:27.440
I loved my wife.

03:27.440 --> 03:32.440
Like, I proposed to my lovely, lovely wife, my partner, my best friend.

03:32.440 --> 03:38.440
We were together for a probably record minimum amount of time before we were like, whoa,

03:38.440 --> 03:39.440
mistake.

03:39.440 --> 03:45.440
And, but I always, I was like, I would say to Cody, like, look, you want to put a ring

03:45.440 --> 03:46.440
on this finger, like do it.

03:46.440 --> 03:51.440
But the one thing I can't do is be like, will you also marry me?

03:51.440 --> 03:57.440
That seems problematic because it's like the proposal is coming from the one guy that's

03:57.440 --> 04:04.440
like, look, you're already established that your opinion of who should be married is flawed.

04:04.440 --> 04:09.440
Is this logic not tracking?

04:09.440 --> 04:12.440
Like, don't get married and then get divorced.

04:12.440 --> 04:17.440
My therapist said the same thing, which is not really because it's disrespecting your

04:17.440 --> 04:18.440
cut.

04:18.440 --> 04:22.440
I'm like, well, no, fucking, you got to do it this time.

04:22.440 --> 04:25.440
But Cody proposed to you on this one, right?

04:25.440 --> 04:26.440
That's what I'm saying.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.440
Yeah.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.440
Is that I'm like, yeah, I'll hold out for that.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.440
Does she like get down on the knee into the whole thing?

04:31.440 --> 04:32.440
Yeah, she did.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.440
She almost drowned.

04:33.440 --> 04:38.440
It was because it was in Tahini and she was, she picked her spot and she did the thing and

04:38.440 --> 04:43.440
she had rehearsed it and she was up to her neck in water and she proposed to me.

04:43.440 --> 04:47.440
I knew it was coming eventually, but I didn't know it was coming there.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.440
Are you going to take the name Heller or are you going to keep Harmon?

04:50.440 --> 04:57.440
I think, selfishly, I would like to take the name Heller because I would like to die.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.440
I've been through this whole thing.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.440
I consider this very therapeutic.

05:02.440 --> 05:11.440
Like, a woman got down on her knee and said, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.440
Would you marry me?

05:12.440 --> 05:17.440
And I was like, only fuck, I knew this was happening, I knew this was happening.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.440
And then I'm like, holy shit, it's happening now.

05:20.440 --> 05:26.440
And then I'm like, honestly, to be honest and share with you, this is not a binary decision

05:26.440 --> 05:27.440
you make.

05:27.440 --> 05:33.440
However, it gets reduced if somebody says to you at the halftime show of a thing.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.440
You're like, the alternative is no, I won't marry you.

05:37.440 --> 05:41.440
There's a little bit of a push there where you're like, yeah, of course.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.440
First and foremost, yes and.

05:43.440 --> 05:48.440
But there's a processor in the back of your head where you're like, what's happening?

05:48.440 --> 05:50.440
How is this going to work?

05:50.440 --> 05:53.440
So your UCB training kicked in at this point?

05:53.440 --> 05:54.440
Of course.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.440
I think everyone's UCB training kicks in.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.440
Everyone doesn't need UCB training.

05:58.440 --> 06:02.440
That was the start of a thing in my Tahitian vacation where I was like in the background,

06:02.440 --> 06:04.440
I didn't share this with Cody at all.

06:04.440 --> 06:09.440
I shared it with my therapist, but I was like, every day since I said yes to this proposal,

06:09.440 --> 06:12.440
I had been confronting this anxiety.

06:12.440 --> 06:17.440
Or I was like, a woman just proposed to you and you said yes.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.440
And what have you given up?

06:19.440 --> 06:20.440
What are you doing?

06:20.440 --> 06:21.440
What's going on?

06:21.440 --> 06:27.440
And it made me kind of like go through these thoughts in my head where I was like, well,

06:27.440 --> 06:31.440
first of all, now I can get as fat as I want.

06:31.440 --> 06:38.440
But then counter that I was like, no, you now have to get thinner than you've ever been.

06:38.440 --> 06:43.440
There's a voice from down here somewhere where he's not saying anything that I disagree with,

06:43.440 --> 06:50.440
but your license to speak is too liberal.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.440
Curtail it.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.440
It's distracting me.

06:54.440 --> 07:00.440
But even though you're saying exactly everything I'm thinking, fuck you, silence.

07:00.440 --> 07:05.440
Free speech zone is in my butt.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.440
Get up my butt, sir.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.440
I started thinking in my head.

07:09.440 --> 07:14.440
It was like an emotional thing where I was like, oh shit, when a guy proposes to a woman,

07:14.440 --> 07:21.440
the guy, it doesn't matter, remove all of your politics about who pays for what and all this stuff.

07:21.440 --> 07:29.440
The bottom line is that a guy is thinking about it and then buying a ring, which is what Cody had to do.

07:29.440 --> 07:34.440
And it's just that power of when you hit the buzzer.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.440
I knew Cody was going to propose to me.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.440
I was in love with her.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
I wanted her to propose to me.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.440
I didn't know it was going to happen then.

07:39.440 --> 07:49.440
But that makes it no, like, it was like, she gets to hit the buzzer in the game show of like, we're married.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.440
She told me, she's like, should I?

07:52.440 --> 07:55.440
I don't want to hear that you got to weigh in.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.440
That's awful.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.440
I told her don't do it.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.440
Okay, all right.

08:00.440 --> 08:05.440
But it was like, and I was like, there was this thing of anxiety hanging over me.

08:05.440 --> 08:10.440
I don't know how much of it had to do with the fact that like, look, I've been married and I fucked it up.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.440
I don't know how to do this.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.440
What would you have proposed to her if she hadn't done it?

08:13.440 --> 08:15.440
Well, I don't know if I would have.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.440
I told her, I told everybody within shouting range.

08:18.440 --> 08:21.440
I was like, look, I love marriage.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.440
So I proposed to my ex-wife.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.440
It didn't work out so good.

08:26.440 --> 08:34.440
Therefore, what right do I have to, it felt like, it's like, what does it mean for me to get out?

08:34.440 --> 08:40.440
What does it mean for me to get on one knee and say, hey, you know what?

08:40.440 --> 08:42.440
I got a feeling.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.440
This one's blue.

08:44.440 --> 08:49.440
It's sort of like, to me, there's an elephant in that room where it's like, yeah, but what do you know?

08:49.440 --> 08:51.440
You're divorced.

08:51.440 --> 08:57.440
You're the one guy in this exchange that doesn't know whether or not you should be proposing to someone.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.440
You already did it.

08:58.440 --> 09:01.440
And it was always an open joke between me and Cody.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.440
And she was like, what if I ever proposed to you?

09:04.440 --> 09:06.440
I'm like, the day you proposed to me, you get an automatic guess.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.440
I love you.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.440
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.

09:09.440 --> 09:14.440
But that's sort of what all couples are, in a sense.

09:14.440 --> 09:21.440
Hopefully, there's not a lot of couples where someone's like, by the way, shoulder get off the pot.

09:21.440 --> 09:23.440
And it's like, oh, fuck, oh, god.

09:23.440 --> 09:28.440
We perceive it that way, but the truth is that it's more of a continuum.

09:28.440 --> 09:35.440
And so that's why I said, of course I said yes, because of course the answer is yes.

09:35.440 --> 09:44.440
And then for the next two days, unbeknownst to Cody, I was sort of like, in my head, it was like, why do I feel uneasy?

09:44.440 --> 09:51.440
And the answer is, because this wasn't, I didn't, I'm missing the way you miss your wallet or your keys.

09:51.440 --> 09:53.440
I'm missing my agency.

09:53.440 --> 09:57.440
It's not like this isn't what I wanted.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.440
It's just that I didn't.

09:59.440 --> 10:05.440
I'm like, I've been shocked, like, cord of like something that doesn't protect me anyway.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.440
It doesn't matter.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.440
I didn't want it, but I was like, it's gone.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.440
I didn't even know I wanted it.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.440
And then I started to think in my head.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.440
I was like, why don't you run through some exercises?

10:15.440 --> 10:18.440
Like, what's your worst nightmare?

10:18.440 --> 10:22.440
I was like, OK, well, I've been taken.

10:22.440 --> 10:26.440
So it's my job to serve this woman for the rest of my life.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.440
And that actually kind of made me start.

10:28.440 --> 10:33.440
Like, I was sort of like, like, I was thinking in my head, it was like, what if you were like property?

10:33.440 --> 10:35.440
What if you had been taken?

10:35.440 --> 10:36.440
What if you had no agency?

10:36.440 --> 10:40.440
What if somebody had looked at you and said, I want that?

10:40.440 --> 10:45.440
And you were like, OK, I'll, OK, I'll let you take that.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.440
And like, I don't want you to leave me.

10:47.440 --> 10:55.440
So I guess I'd better be on my toes from now on, as opposed to this other.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.440
I wonder if any woman here could relate to that feeling.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.440
That's my point.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.440
I was sort of like in doses.

11:00.440 --> 11:03.440
I was sort of like subjecting myself.

11:03.440 --> 11:11.440
And the more I pushed the weird dystopian narrative where it was like, what if you actually were just a slave?

11:11.440 --> 11:12.440
What if you were a servant?

11:12.440 --> 11:13.440
What is your nightmare?

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
What is the worst thing?

11:14.440 --> 11:17.440
What do we fear about?

11:17.440 --> 11:19.440
What do these symbols represent?

11:19.440 --> 11:21.440
Ring on your finger.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.440
Like, ring on my finger.

11:22.440 --> 11:23.440
I'm doing this.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.440
I take that.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.440
My father pays for this.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.440
He gives you away.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.440
All this transactional stuff.

11:31.440 --> 11:38.440
And then thinking about my part of it and going like, what if I was like a damsel?

11:38.440 --> 11:40.440
What if I, yeah.

11:40.440 --> 11:43.440
It came out, I liked it.

11:43.440 --> 11:50.440
I was like, oh, like, yeah, this is the good side of the equality thing.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.440
Like, yeah, fucking, I don't want to deal with this shit.

11:53.440 --> 12:00.440
Like, doesn't every guy want, like, aren't incels, like, aren't incels complaining about, like,

12:00.440 --> 12:05.440
don't, like, they, like, how come women aren't just giving me sex?

12:05.440 --> 12:12.440
Like, do you think they'd be happy if, like, we lived in a world where women could, like, walk up to them and go like, you, incel.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.440
I choose you.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.440
I like your cheekbones.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.440
Can you make breakfast?

12:18.440 --> 12:22.440
Would they be willing to, like, meet them halfway a little bit?

12:22.440 --> 12:26.440
Because according to their website, no, they don't.

12:26.440 --> 12:30.440
They want a world where, like, women are, like, you can get them in the mail and stuff.

12:30.440 --> 12:34.440
But somewhere in the middle there is, like, partnership where it's like, oh, me?

12:34.440 --> 12:38.440
Like, which I really, I really like that feeling.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.440
All right, let's move on to something else.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.440
Thank you for congratulating me on my engagement.

12:42.440 --> 12:45.440
Happy 2019.

12:45.440 --> 12:47.440
Yes, I will.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.440
Happy life.

12:48.440 --> 12:52.440
I will take her, I will take her name because I kind of don't like Dan Harmon anymore.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.440
It won't be because I'm, like, a feminist.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.440
It'll be because I don't like myself.

12:56.440 --> 13:02.440
It'll be me conveniently going like, oh, that guy that sexually harassed my lady and apologized for it on NPR.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.440
But he's dead.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.440
I'll just be like, Dan Heller's in the house.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.440
Like, I kind of like that idea.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.440
Like, let's call it Heller Town and let's...

13:10.440 --> 13:12.440
Also, yeah.

13:12.440 --> 13:16.440
You won't have to change your monogram on your towels.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.440
Still DH.

13:18.440 --> 13:22.440
The people that really respect me have only ever called me DH.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.440
That's the bottom line.

13:24.440 --> 13:28.440
Like, when you see Judd Appetite walking down the road, you go, hey, DH.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.440
Nothing changes.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.440
He gets it.

13:32.440 --> 13:36.440
Wait, so do you guys think you're going to get married?

13:36.440 --> 13:38.440
No, she's so lazy.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.440
It'll be a million years.

13:40.440 --> 13:44.440
She was so excited about proposing to a guy and making him...

13:44.440 --> 13:46.440
Like, she'll be...

13:46.440 --> 13:48.440
I bet.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.440
I'll be honest.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.440
I was stunned by the feminist triumph.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.440
I was really taken aback.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.440
That's all she wanted. She's done.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.440
That's the thing.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.440
I was like, I don't even know how to feel about this.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.440
Now, if we get married, do you want to...

14:02.440 --> 14:04.440
Yeah, it'll be five years from now.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.440
Rob Schrab will be officiating.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.440
We'll be in Death Valley between two rocks.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.440
Like, it'll be...

14:10.440 --> 14:12.440
There'll be eight people there.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.440
I love each other so much that you just name each other Schrab.

14:16.440 --> 14:20.440
You become Dan and Cody Schrab.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.440
That could be good.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.440
Yeah, I am...

14:24.440 --> 14:26.440
Prove your love.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.440
I would love to prove my love.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.440
Okay, let's talk about some stuff.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.440
Happy New Year. It's been such a long time.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.440
Okay.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.440
A loud, sneezing family on boat.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.440
That sounds like a hot one.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.440
Let's start with that one.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.440
I want to hear about that.

14:44.440 --> 14:48.440
Okay, there was a fucking insanely loud, sneezing family.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.440
As we came back from Tahiti,

14:50.440 --> 14:52.440
we went to this island.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.440
We got on the return boat.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.440
You got to go back to the...

14:56.440 --> 14:58.440
Your dream is over.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.440
It's time to stop.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.440
You got to go back home now.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.440
You're getting back on the boat,

15:04.440 --> 15:08.440
and you're back on the boat with whoever else's dream is expired.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.440
And there was this family.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.440
And they were just like...

15:12.440 --> 15:14.440
They were from Dallas.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.440
I gleaned that.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.440
But Cody was like,

15:18.440 --> 15:20.440
what is the point of a sneeze

15:20.440 --> 15:22.440
if you haven't sneezed yet?

15:22.440 --> 15:24.440
Because there was this person back there.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.440
We didn't...

15:26.440 --> 15:28.440
And they were just like,

15:28.440 --> 15:30.440
they were just sneezing so much.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.440
And the only funny part of the story

15:32.440 --> 15:34.440
is that we went through what we perceived

15:34.440 --> 15:36.440
as this whole journey.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.440
We were like, we're trying to get back home.

15:38.440 --> 15:42.440
And Americans are...

15:42.440 --> 15:46.440
I experienced just a small taste of...

15:46.440 --> 15:48.440
I think we're a little privileged

15:48.440 --> 15:50.440
because we were in the middle of...

15:50.440 --> 15:54.440
The kknave. of the world where...

15:54.440 --> 15:56.440
English is not exactly...

15:56.440 --> 15:58.440
It's not like everyone's panicking

15:58.440 --> 16:00.440
if they don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.440
Where it's like...

16:02.440 --> 16:06.440
I don't think I've ever traveled outside of the American hegemony.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.440
And I...

16:08.440 --> 16:10.440
Going to Tahiti,

16:10.440 --> 16:12.440
you kind of enter a French hegemony

16:12.440 --> 16:14.440
where it's like,

16:14.440 --> 16:16.440
look, everyone speaks English,

16:16.440 --> 16:18.440
we get it.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.440
And the truth is,

16:20.440 --> 16:22.440
I am a property of

16:22.440 --> 16:24.440
French hegemony.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.440
So I have a French accent

16:26.440 --> 16:28.440
and I will speak to you in French

16:28.440 --> 16:30.440
because you're this first world person.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.440
If you're like, I don't know French,

16:32.440 --> 16:36.440
you're like, can I play Minecraft in my room?

16:36.440 --> 16:38.440
And they're like, who the fuck are you?

16:38.440 --> 16:40.440
You're a monster.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.440
The airports are like speaking French

16:42.440 --> 16:44.440
over speakers.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.440
Imagine that nightmare.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.440
Imagine an airport that didn't speak English.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.440
I'm like...

16:50.440 --> 16:52.440
I was like, holy shit.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.440
No wonder everyone just crowds the gate

16:54.440 --> 16:56.440
instead of letting me take my first class seat.

16:56.440 --> 17:00.440
The reason I bring it up

17:00.440 --> 17:02.440
is because there was this family

17:02.440 --> 17:04.440
that like,

17:04.440 --> 17:06.440
they were just like,

17:06.440 --> 17:08.440
hachoo, hachoo, hachoo.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.440
This guy was like, kept sneezing

17:10.440 --> 17:12.440
and coding here,

17:12.440 --> 17:14.440
going through all this shit and we're like,

17:14.440 --> 17:16.440
I don't know, whatever.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.440
It's all good.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.440
I don't know what's happening.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.440
Did you forget your name called on an airport?

17:22.440 --> 17:24.440
Terrifying.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.440
I'm sorry, you're very excited.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.440
You're like, no.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.440
Nobody's name is...

17:30.440 --> 17:32.440
All right.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.440
Happened to me once? Scary.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.440
When I was traveling with you guys...

17:36.440 --> 17:38.440
Spencer Crittenden, will you come up?

17:38.440 --> 17:40.440
Mr. Crandon, report to the thing for whatever.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.440
And you're like, aren't you thinking like...

17:42.440 --> 17:44.440
I gotta run. I gotta get out of here.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.440
Oh my god, let me, oh my god.

17:46.440 --> 17:50.440
I'm interfering with the operation of the fucking thing.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.440
So like, now imagine

17:52.440 --> 17:54.440
like a...

17:54.440 --> 17:56.440
Like a French airport.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.440
Right.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.440
I just don't know

18:00.440 --> 18:02.440
where the parody begins

18:02.440 --> 18:04.440
and the satire ends.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.440
I just keep

18:06.440 --> 18:08.440
buttoning it up.

18:08.440 --> 18:10.440
You're like a ventriloquist dummy

18:10.440 --> 18:12.440
in a Twilight Zone movie.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.440
Am I supposed to throw you across the room?

18:16.440 --> 18:18.440
Is it going to turn out that I was you the whole time?

18:18.440 --> 18:20.440
Whoa.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.440
Just take it easy.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.440
Just watch.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.440
Just watch and just take it easy.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.440
No one can hear what you're referring to.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.440
Oh, really?

18:30.440 --> 18:32.440
Well, there's a guy in the first row

18:32.440 --> 18:34.440
that keeps saying things that are not...

18:34.440 --> 18:36.440
They're fine.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.440
I'll go, hey, I don't get shoes.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.440
And I'll be like, the left one or the right one?

18:40.440 --> 18:42.440
All right.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.440
So there's a voice.

18:44.440 --> 18:46.440
It's like...

18:46.440 --> 18:48.440
I'm so confused.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.440
I'm like...

18:50.440 --> 18:52.440
I'm like...

18:52.440 --> 18:54.440
I'm like...

18:54.440 --> 18:56.440
And I'm like...

18:56.440 --> 18:58.440
Jeff did a thing.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.440
$5.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.440
$5.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.440
No, but that's so terrifying.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.440
It's in another language.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.440
All right.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.440
So what happened?

19:10.440 --> 19:12.440
What are you doing?

19:12.440 --> 19:14.440
I was creating magical comedy.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.440
No.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.440
Jeff Davis.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.440
I'm trying to connect with people.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.440
You're doing great.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.440
You're doing admirably given the

19:24.440 --> 19:26.440
circumstance.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.440
Don't just think I'm up against shit tonight.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.440
I know you're always...

19:30.440 --> 19:32.440
Every Monday night, you're absolutely up against shit.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.440
Probably other nights too,

19:34.440 --> 19:36.440
but definitely Monday nights.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.440
I'm seeing it right now.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.440
So you're in a French airport,

19:40.440 --> 19:42.440
a French-controlled airport.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.440
And then a little bit...

19:44.440 --> 19:46.440
I'm like...

19:46.440 --> 19:48.440
Dan Harmon?

19:48.440 --> 19:50.440
It's so hard to...

19:50.440 --> 19:52.440
I'm getting through.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.440
I go up to the counter.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.440
Cody's back there.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.440
They called my name.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.440
My name's never been called.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.440
I always thought that when they called your name,

20:02.440 --> 20:04.440
it was because you weren't there for something

20:04.440 --> 20:06.440
or you were going to lose your seat.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.440
I got all the way up to the counter.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.440
It was so...

20:10.440 --> 20:12.440
The amount of people whose lives I

20:12.440 --> 20:14.440
got like bags hitting baby's heads.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.440
Because I'm like...

20:16.440 --> 20:18.440
I don't understand.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.440
Everyone's standing.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.440
They're just standing because all they know

20:22.440 --> 20:24.440
is that the people are speaking

20:24.440 --> 20:26.440
in French and what they're saying is that

20:26.440 --> 20:28.440
the plane's going to take off.

20:28.440 --> 20:30.440
And so everyone's just compressed

20:30.440 --> 20:32.440
like a fucking Lego sculpture.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.440
And so you have to...

20:34.440 --> 20:36.440
You have to actively mush

20:36.440 --> 20:38.440
through that if they go like,

20:38.440 --> 20:40.440
Dan Harmon? Dan Harmon?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.440
And I'm like, I can't...

20:42.440 --> 20:44.440
I have no choice.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.440
I would never do this to anyone.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.440
I ran my American Express card.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.440
Nay, my assistant did.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.440
I don't...

20:52.440 --> 20:54.440
I did this...

20:54.440 --> 20:56.440
I subscribed to a tier of

20:56.440 --> 20:58.440
human experience that doesn't

20:58.440 --> 21:00.440
involve me ever touching you

21:00.440 --> 21:02.440
or you touching me.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.440
I am like trying to bustle.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.440
Like every single

21:06.440 --> 21:08.440
human being has a right

21:08.440 --> 21:10.440
to look at you like,

21:10.440 --> 21:12.440
what are you doing, you horrible ferret?

21:12.440 --> 21:14.440
Like, why are you

21:14.440 --> 21:16.440
fucking mushing me

21:16.440 --> 21:18.440
and touching my child's head

21:18.440 --> 21:20.440
and like fucking like...

21:20.440 --> 21:22.440
I just want to say to all of them

21:22.440 --> 21:24.440
I don't want to do this.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.440
They called my name

21:26.440 --> 21:28.440
at the desk that says

21:28.440 --> 21:30.440
whether you can get on the plane or not.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.440
And I was just like, oh, excuse

21:32.440 --> 21:34.440
me.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.440
See who plays about

21:36.440 --> 21:38.440
your baby's head and

21:38.440 --> 21:40.440
I'm sorry and someone took a shit

21:40.440 --> 21:42.440
on the floor and it's like...

21:42.440 --> 21:44.440
And they get all the way up to the thing

21:44.440 --> 21:46.440
and they're like...

21:46.440 --> 21:48.440
I said, you called my name

21:48.440 --> 21:50.440
and they're like, Mr. Harmon?

21:50.440 --> 21:52.440
Yeah, and they're like, just checking.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.440
Uh...

21:54.440 --> 21:56.440
For real, I swear

21:56.440 --> 21:58.440
to Christ.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.440
They literally said just checking.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.440
Were they worried about you?

22:04.440 --> 22:06.440
No, I'll never know.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.440
Because as soon as they said it, I'm like...

22:08.440 --> 22:10.440
Just checking?

22:10.440 --> 22:12.440
I feel like Liam Neeson

22:12.440 --> 22:14.440
and taken like a more...

22:14.440 --> 22:16.440
Is Cody part of a white slavery ring now?

22:16.440 --> 22:18.440
It's left her.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.440
You don't understand. These airports

22:20.440 --> 22:22.440
are un-American.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.440
They're downright

22:24.440 --> 22:26.440
French.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.440
You know, they...

22:28.440 --> 22:30.440
Their toast is weird

22:30.440 --> 22:32.440
even.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.440
It's soft.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.440
We like hard toast.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.440
American toast, we call it.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.440
I may never...

22:50.440 --> 22:52.440
It's weird.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.440
I love American toast.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.440
I love it too.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.440
It's got no maple syrup on it.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.440
Oh, but anyways, the reason I was bringing that up

23:02.440 --> 23:04.440
was because we were in that position

23:04.440 --> 23:06.440
and we sat down eventually in this terminal

23:06.440 --> 23:08.440
and we were like,

23:08.440 --> 23:10.440
God damn, this place keeps you on a razor's edge.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.440
You don't know the language, so you're like listening.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.440
You know, when the people

23:14.440 --> 23:16.440
are speaking English over the intercom,

23:16.440 --> 23:18.440
it's already muddled

23:18.440 --> 23:20.440
and you're like, for me,

23:20.440 --> 23:22.440
I'm on edge all the time.

23:22.440 --> 23:24.440
I don't understand what the fuck you're saying. Eat the fucking mic.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.440
What are you saying?

23:26.440 --> 23:31.440
I'm on flat scare. I'm on a razor's edge.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.440
I want to be on the edge.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.440
I want to see if people are like...

23:36.440 --> 23:38.440
If you want to stand up right now,

23:38.440 --> 23:40.440
I'll get over to the gate.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.440
If you're Vietnamese,

23:42.440 --> 23:44.440
I'll get over to the gate.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.440
And everyone's just like...

23:46.440 --> 23:48.440
Understandably it goes, look, man,

23:48.440 --> 23:50.440
I understand hierarchy

23:50.440 --> 23:52.440
in one of two ways.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.440
Either everything's taken care of

23:54.440 --> 24:00.760
have no autonomy or I fucking like nothing's taken care of because I have

24:00.760 --> 24:06.400
all autonomy your airlines tell you everything you have no autonomy and

24:06.400 --> 24:11.880
nothing's taken care of they tell you what that'll be 300 bucks to go to Seattle

24:11.880 --> 24:17.360
if someone pays 3,000 bucks they have a right to tell you you're a piece of

24:17.360 --> 24:28.920
shit we're not gonna police it though like now boarding now imagine that in

24:28.920 --> 24:31.820
French and then I'm like I'm like sitting down with Cody I'm like God damn

24:31.820 --> 24:36.200
it just gives me so much fucking anxiety and she's like and Cody goes yeah

24:36.200 --> 24:42.360
well the one sunny side of the street is at least we're away from those fucking

24:42.360 --> 24:49.160
sneezing people like you know at airport terminals they like the seats are back

24:49.160 --> 24:56.520
to back like the absolutely like yeah it was just like of course that family's

24:56.520 --> 25:01.720
traveling with you they're on their way to the fucking America all right Dallas

25:01.720 --> 25:07.720
it was really funny look we got off on the wrong foot it's 2019 I'm glad to be

25:07.720 --> 25:11.320
back I had a hard time traveling I don't like other white people I guess I don't

25:11.320 --> 25:18.040
know what my point is but you hate airlines you know you a lot of people

25:18.040 --> 25:23.080
have anxiety when they're doing air travel and so like you're expressing

25:23.080 --> 25:29.160
your anxiety about what a lot of people have anxiety about it when all of us

25:29.160 --> 25:33.040
travel we all have a hard time like what you're subjected to obviously a

25:33.040 --> 25:38.600
dehumanizing event and I guess I guess I'm speaking from place of privilege or

25:38.600 --> 25:43.640
whatever where I'm like you know I don't get it like I only leave my house for

25:43.640 --> 25:50.080
one thing and that's like and then I always like go hey send them a million

25:50.080 --> 25:54.520
dollars in advance like when I get there could they just treat me like a fucking

25:54.520 --> 26:00.520
like something above a mosquito and the answer is always like absolutely not no

26:00.520 --> 26:05.520
like happy to take your money very enthusiastic about that oh did you want

26:05.520 --> 26:11.000
the leg extendable package where you can extend your human legs to a point where

26:11.000 --> 26:18.120
you don't actually sustain permanent damage that's a million dollars we'll

26:18.120 --> 26:21.480
take that million dollars let's thank you so much for flying American Airlines

26:21.480 --> 26:24.200
we love your million dollars but remember we're the airline where you can

26:24.200 --> 26:28.640
extend your legs a little bit and then you get there and they're just like hey

26:28.640 --> 26:35.760
who are you what the fuck's going what fuck are you slow down whoa whoa whoa whoa take

26:35.760 --> 26:40.480

26:49.560 --> 26:54.400
government that's cool that's fucking cool that's all right still a little bit

26:54.400 --> 26:57.640
of back and forth the each airline they pick and choose whether or not you get

26:57.640 --> 27:02.320
like so here's my shoes I gotta go people get your name get your number

27:02.320 --> 27:06.920

27:14.560 --> 27:20.960
required necessarily to go visit grandma for Christmas I don't see they've

27:20.960 --> 27:25.320
tricked us into thinking that they're doing us a favor but there's money

27:25.320 --> 27:31.640
changing hands so where's the favor but you like you you have a and a rational

27:31.640 --> 27:34.960
hatred of airlines I have an aggressive

27:34.960 --> 27:42.840
hatred of airlines because if I'm gonna die and I am yeah I would like oh I

27:42.840 --> 27:47.760
didn't mean like that Spencer seconds at my oh sorry I didn't mean to like that

27:47.760 --> 27:56.000
okay let's walk through this for a second like hey anybody you like this

27:56.000 --> 27:59.560
podcast right like some people pay for the podcast you paid to get in here

27:59.560 --> 28:10.560
right so like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna put you in a metal tube and I'm gonna

28:10.560 --> 28:18.040
fling you into the air and if you even talk I've talked to like aerodynamics

28:18.040 --> 28:22.200
like engineers like this I'm always like what the fuck is going on how are we in

28:22.200 --> 28:27.240
the air I you ever talked to no you ever you ever talked to like a person that

28:27.240 --> 28:30.120
went to school for the shit they always tell you they go like well no it's

28:30.120 --> 28:35.520
really not that big a deal you know the big things on the wings like they suck

28:35.520 --> 28:38.800
in the air and then they push it out the other side that's how you stay there

28:38.800 --> 28:43.600
was it where's the air coming from well you're in the air it's like a paper

28:43.600 --> 28:51.840
airplane it's like a paper airplane it's like a paper airplane it's not pass pass

28:51.840 --> 28:56.800
pass pass well then you can't oh good look I guess your grandma's gonna die

28:56.800 --> 29:01.120
without talking to you about your okay I'll get in a fucking fine I'm gonna get

29:01.120 --> 29:05.200
in a flake to talk to my grandma just of course I have a choice it's like it's

29:05.200 --> 29:11.560
like every every industry well I'd like to go visit my grandma which airline

29:11.560 --> 29:18.760
treated me well again everything you're doing is exactly as what I'm thinking

29:18.760 --> 29:28.120
but stop stop but it was like you can't go to an airport and go I like every

29:28.120 --> 29:32.000
industry that did this to you like they would be outlawed you can't go to an

29:32.000 --> 29:39.400
airport and go my grandma died I need to get to Seattle by 9 o'clock like any

29:39.400 --> 29:47.000
other industry like five companies would be like hey grandma died like get on the

29:47.000 --> 29:50.440
fucking grandma caravan like we're gonna give you a face mask we're gonna think

29:50.440 --> 29:55.160
and then other the price-fixing thing would be like they would compete with

29:55.160 --> 30:00.520
each other like I don't mean to be a libertarian but fuck you like the like

30:00.520 --> 30:05.920
don't fucking give an industry like the ability to not compete with each other

30:05.920 --> 30:10.920
is damn honestly are you just like admit that you you're just a nervous

30:10.920 --> 30:17.680
traveler and you're freaking out about the fact that yes travel is is tedious

30:17.680 --> 30:23.600
and there's lots of hoops to jump through but you're just a nervous traveler

30:23.600 --> 30:28.200
and you're how is that different from being a nervous eater are you nervous

30:28.200 --> 30:32.880
if you go to a restaurant and you go like I'm sorry like like I don't want to eat

30:32.880 --> 30:37.120
something that's gonna kill me or I don't want to I don't want to eat like

30:37.120 --> 30:40.480
something with has a bunch of bones in it is are you the asshole if the

30:40.480 --> 30:43.520
restaurant's like yeah well fuck you you wanted to eat it's three o'clock fuck

30:43.520 --> 30:46.720
off yeah but that that's not parallel to what you're talking about it's

30:46.720 --> 30:50.240
absolutely parallel if I if I want to go to my grandma's funeral and it's in

30:50.240 --> 30:53.400
Texas and this is a certain time I have absolutely no choice over which airline I

30:53.400 --> 30:56.800
travel on I don't have any choice at all they have a monopoly so there are

30:56.800 --> 31:00.760
cartels it's not it's not about your nerves about traveling and I don't want

31:00.760 --> 31:06.000
to die at the hands of fuck wads like I like I want I want the skies to be

31:06.000 --> 31:12.760
filled with planes I want I want I want when I want to go to the airport and I

31:12.760 --> 31:15.920
don't I want I want people to be standing outside the airport and be like

31:15.920 --> 31:19.800
hey man hey where you going where you going let me hook you up I'm like what's

31:19.800 --> 31:22.720
going on here is like where you going will you grandma dad I'll get you there

31:22.720 --> 31:25.720
well come on let me tell you what you got I'll be like well hold on a second

31:25.720 --> 31:28.680
what's this guy saying it's like yo man your grandma died I'll fucking hook you

31:28.680 --> 31:32.680
up like let me tell you what we're showing a Steve Carell movie we're gonna

31:32.680 --> 31:38.480
fucking rub your feet like like I want to fucking shop around it's an American

31:38.480 --> 31:43.360
right you spilled so much vodka during this it's good

31:43.360 --> 31:49.680
anyone how am I the only one out range by this no I'm I agree it doesn't make

31:49.680 --> 31:55.920
any sense it's literally like I understand drink your vodka drink your

31:55.920 --> 32:01.480
vodka you're spilling so much they're selling you worried about your vodka to

32:01.480 --> 32:06.920
visit your children in Seattle but you'd have no choice and then you get on the

32:06.920 --> 32:13.000
plane wait I thought the peak when I saw them suffocate a dog I was like well

32:13.000 --> 32:19.880
that ought to wake up a few Senate hearings are you fucking kidding you're

32:19.880 --> 32:25.240
like I beat a man half to death and dragged him off a plane these are

32:25.240 --> 32:30.240
terrible corporations but they get together and compare you're just a

32:30.240 --> 32:42.680
nervous traveler you're saying you hate traveling you hate being at an airport

32:42.680 --> 32:47.760
you hate being on a plane why can't it be both who loves them I like why is it

32:47.760 --> 32:52.720
why should they be able to take money from you well I love and then turn you

32:52.720 --> 32:58.560
loose against each other like like when Nabisco says to half the population or

32:58.560 --> 33:02.520
30% of the population hey welcome to a new white chocolate

33:02.520 --> 33:09.400
ligerian experience like they don't say hey do you like white chocolate it will

33:09.400 --> 33:13.640
take your money give us a subscription to chocolate and if you want to make

33:13.640 --> 33:18.360
sure it's white fight the people that like regular chocolate just fight them

33:18.360 --> 33:21.160
for it because it's first come first served I'm almost certain this metaphor

33:21.160 --> 33:27.640
holds up like it's the airline industry is the only sheltered totally non

33:27.640 --> 33:32.320
capitalistic like fucking sheltered weird biodome where a class of society is

33:32.320 --> 33:36.400
allowed to you're just afraid of flying just say that I can it be both why can't

33:36.400 --> 33:39.600
it be both by the way how do these fucking things stay in the air that's

33:39.600 --> 33:45.280
the ultimate outrage you're selling a dream it's a giant piece of metal it

33:45.280 --> 33:49.600
shouldn't be in the air why can't it be both things yeah it's a fucking

33:49.600 --> 33:58.320
Travis I take it back you love flying you love flying I don't I love being on

33:58.320 --> 34:06.280
the plane I love mine crafting I like like it's true he's right you just you're

34:06.280 --> 34:10.400
just terrified of travel or being around other people you turn up you're

34:10.400 --> 34:14.720
terrified but that's not being crammed into a small space with other people but

34:14.720 --> 34:19.140
also he's being oppressed by corporate entities that are conspiring to fuck

34:19.140 --> 34:24.600
America never see that dance before they are hurting people they're beating

34:24.600 --> 34:28.920
them up and killing animals they tased a man and punched his face until his

34:28.920 --> 34:32.760
face was bleeding and dragged him off a plane and the corporation that did that

34:32.760 --> 34:37.520
is doing just as much business as they're legally empowered to do that that

34:37.520 --> 34:41.920
doesn't fuck with you when you're like listening to their safety video that

34:41.920 --> 34:45.960
doesn't fuck with you a little bit no you're like well when push comes to shove

34:45.960 --> 34:52.000
literally you will have police come on board the plane and drag a man off the

34:52.000 --> 34:57.640
plane like and then they're like don't forget to blow your lollipop if we if

34:57.640 --> 35:04.360
we if we fucking have an oversight come on man like we risk our lives like it's

35:04.360 --> 35:07.600
like we jam into a metal tube and they shoot us like a lawn yard across the

35:07.600 --> 35:12.240
country like we got to do it our grandma will yell at us like like so we got to do

35:12.240 --> 35:16.000
it and then there's like you can't you don't get a choice when you're like your

35:16.000 --> 35:20.440
grandma's sick and you you go online and you're like my grandma's sick so I got a

35:20.440 --> 35:25.360
I got to go to see from LA to Seattle you don't get to fucking choose you

35:25.360 --> 35:31.320
definitely do not get to choose like how you travel like they the year they'll

35:31.320 --> 35:37.000
say oh this airline will go from LA to Seattle and like they'll fucking lie to

35:37.000 --> 35:42.520
you they'll go like you can't even like imagine the shit that's a variable like

35:42.520 --> 35:46.000
you go like I'm gonna go from LA to Seattle to see my grandma get buried and

35:46.000 --> 35:49.280
then you're like I'm gonna bring my laptop to see your grandma get married and

35:49.280 --> 35:53.480
then you get on the premises that you're going to your grandma get married

35:53.480 --> 35:57.680
very get on the plane and you're like a very fucked do I plug in my laptop I

35:57.680 --> 36:01.680
thought I thought I could plug in my fucking laptop and you're like or it's

36:01.680 --> 36:09.640
broken flight attendant and they're like what what and you're like I just don't

36:09.640 --> 36:15.080
can't plug in looks like it doesn't work that way fuck off you piece of shit and

36:15.080 --> 36:21.040
you're like okay I guess I guess I fucked up I guess I just fucked up I

36:21.040 --> 36:24.720
guess maybe change the model of plane like it maybe you shouldn't fly anymore

36:24.720 --> 36:29.240
maybe that's not your thing yeah no those are my choices like I should not

36:29.240 --> 36:36.280
fly anymore or I should get beat love the company that's been assigned to me

36:36.280 --> 36:43.880
that's great like like like hey maybe you shouldn't drink water anymore or hey

36:43.880 --> 36:48.320
fucking take it the way Nestle gives it to you yeah it makes sense if you want

36:48.320 --> 36:51.440
to travel across the country which could mean the difference between you getting

36:51.440 --> 36:56.360
fired or promoted maybe you should if you're so passionate about whether or

36:56.360 --> 37:00.480
not you don't want to be treated like an animal maybe you shouldn't fly that

37:00.480 --> 37:04.480
makes sense like hey maybe if you don't like technology just why don't you ride

37:04.480 --> 37:07.520
a horse around in a circle while everyone takes a train across the country

37:07.520 --> 37:12.320
yeah let's look your side of the argument doesn't need any fucking support

37:12.320 --> 37:16.600
it's called entropy or evolution they could call it whatever you want but it's

37:16.600 --> 37:22.120
the side that doesn't need any help I'm over here with the other people getting

37:22.120 --> 37:29.520
sneezed on and going we all get it's all chaos I like like I'm like yeah you

37:29.520 --> 37:32.920
know what'd be nice is if airline companies were like oh shit we're gonna

37:32.920 --> 37:36.440
go out of business unless we treat these people like human beings fucking

37:36.440 --> 37:43.640
zag nut has to hold themselves to that standard are you kidding me walk me

37:43.640 --> 37:48.880
through that you get a fucking refund there's anybody if you make socks tuna

37:48.880 --> 37:56.000
chairs anything like there is literally one industry that where where they're

37:56.000 --> 38:05.000
like oh did you get a suffocated dog shit so sorry anyways hey soul to the

38:05.000 --> 38:08.640
mother there's one industry that's allowed to do that the airline industry

38:08.640 --> 38:12.360
that's it and they have that like it always I always bristle in the speech

38:12.360 --> 38:16.760
or the video where they're like you know you got a legally comply with all

38:16.760 --> 38:20.120
commands that means like if there's someone on the power trip was like hey

38:20.120 --> 38:25.320
bark like a dog you piece of shit like technically speaking by the law you would

38:25.320 --> 38:29.960
have to do that otherwise they could then call security to beat you up and drag

38:29.960 --> 38:33.240
you tased out of the build you know out of the plane I don't like I don't think

38:33.240 --> 38:36.760
that'll ever happen but when I watch that stuff it's like yeah that's what

38:36.760 --> 38:40.320
they're saying is yeah technically speaking we will tell you whatever you

38:40.320 --> 38:45.480
we want you to do and we'll beat you up which I mean is the law it's a it's

38:45.480 --> 38:50.040
scary I don't like the fact there's a couple of lines that their safety video

38:50.040 --> 38:57.120
is a rap or like there's robots and like if you see something coming out of the

38:57.120 --> 39:04.840
air you have to put a life vest and under your chair and that's straight up

39:04.840 --> 39:09.760
virgin like we missed out there are business I we all sing along to is like

39:09.760 --> 39:14.160
but this isn't saving anybody's lives this is this is absolutely mad use the

39:14.160 --> 39:18.760
thing to talk about that a little bit like you know like they make these

39:18.760 --> 39:23.880
videos like virgins was good I was I I would watch I'm annoyed with it or I'm

39:23.880 --> 39:27.880
not creatively but I'm like they didn't make any mistakes the people in charge

39:27.880 --> 39:32.400
of whether I live or die sought to make a little choreography thing and I'm not

39:32.400 --> 39:36.280
seeing any evidence that translates into Jesus Christ how are you gonna get the

39:36.280 --> 39:39.840
landing gear down compare that to what's the one where it's like the George

39:39.840 --> 39:44.240
Gershwin thing where they're like or no no no what's the one that's like the rip

39:44.240 --> 39:48.000
off of Michelle Gondry what's the airline that were like the the brunette

39:48.000 --> 39:52.040
flight attendant is like is that American I think it might be it's like a

39:52.040 --> 39:56.240
Michelle Gondry thing where she's like the like very charismatic brunette it's

39:56.240 --> 40:00.560
like hey welcome to whatever this airline is and she's like now let me walk you

40:00.560 --> 40:03.920
through it and then she walks through and it's like the stepped-out Gondry-esque

40:03.920 --> 40:07.400
thing where there's like stop motion involved but there's also like live

40:07.400 --> 40:11.200
action and it's like but it's like you're watching it you're like oh they

40:11.200 --> 40:14.080
fucked up that take so then they just shortcut it and I'm like what are they

40:14.080 --> 40:19.600
gonna do if we fly into a mountain all right like I mean you're inviting me to

40:19.600 --> 40:23.280
make that scrutiny like don't don't don't fucking all you got to do is like

40:23.280 --> 40:27.360
have a person like on the video screen go hi my name's Gary I'll fly your plane

40:27.360 --> 40:35.120
I promise do it safe like like if during that video he's like hi my name's Gary I

40:35.120 --> 40:40.200
promise to fly your plane but not flame fuck fuck fuck fuck take it again and

40:40.200 --> 40:45.840
they keep it in I have a right to be like what the fuck am I on I had to do

40:45.840 --> 40:48.920
and the flight attendant be like well he's not an actor he's a pilot I'm like

40:48.920 --> 40:53.760
yeah but your company doesn't give a fuck I had to do we were flying from

40:53.760 --> 40:57.960
somewhere to somewhere like over the Rockies and the guy I think we're

40:57.960 --> 41:04.120
leaving out of either like Nevada or Arizona and the guy had cowboy boots on

41:04.120 --> 41:09.080
and he was our pilot and he got in there and he sounded like you're 70 Sam and

41:09.080 --> 41:13.480
he got in there and he goes there's no everyone we're gonna go through some

41:13.480 --> 41:17.880
extreme turbulence so I want you to put your seatbelts on I want you to strap

41:17.880 --> 41:20.760
them in real tight because we're gonna you're gonna be bouncing all over the

41:20.760 --> 41:26.100
joint yeah yeah the telemetry from the three planes ahead of us and we're

41:26.100 --> 41:30.000
gonna go through some real tough stuff and this is not a joke he goes put your

41:30.000 --> 41:34.840
put your seatbelts on strap them down low and tight and he wasn't joking we

41:34.840 --> 41:40.400
were we were fucking all over the joint I just and he was he's he kept laughing

41:40.400 --> 41:46.520
drinkers like I wasn't lying to you was I think I love that I love that that's a

41:46.520 --> 41:50.880
good pilot because we had you 70 Sam at the fucking I don't like when they

41:50.880 --> 41:54.480
don't say anything it's like fuck like we like coming back from Tahiti it was

41:54.480 --> 41:59.960
like fucking everywhere and I would Cody was out like a light and I was like oh

41:59.960 --> 42:05.160
my god like the the pilot would come on and be like a good thing of all my

42:05.160 --> 42:10.520
credit a little new mr. Bean and Jerry Lewis and I was like like I don't know

42:10.520 --> 42:14.000
what this guy's saying he might be like I gotta admit to you I'm a little bit

42:14.000 --> 42:18.920
afraid right now like his tone of voice was just polite and French and I was

42:18.920 --> 42:22.240
like I everyone was asleep and I'm like am I the only one that knows we're gonna

42:22.240 --> 42:27.360
die I do need I I was listening to a radio lab about War of the Worlds today

42:27.360 --> 42:32.760
and they touched on just this idea of the patriarchal kind of like the idea

42:32.760 --> 42:40.040
of the news industry the the the the male father figure going first of all

42:40.040 --> 42:45.640
everything's fucked second of all it's okay I'm in charge and how that's being

42:45.640 --> 42:49.960
sold like how we created that with the news industry and things like you you

42:49.960 --> 42:54.240
if you heard a woman's voice like you have to ask yourself like if you heard

42:54.240 --> 42:58.000
a female pilots voice like it's a psychosexual like thing to ask yourself

42:58.000 --> 43:03.280
like what what do we need from news anchors pilots and things like how much

43:03.280 --> 43:07.600
are you being sold you have everything to fear but I'm here with you I'm Wolf

43:07.600 --> 43:12.720
Blitzer like you're gonna you're about to see a flash in the background I would

43:12.720 --> 43:18.880
love your 70 Sam guy going like oh whoa this one's a hopper like I I do need

43:18.880 --> 43:23.000
that because I was I was like I why am I in charge of when something goes wrong

43:23.000 --> 43:27.600
which is what the good horror movie or a narrative like does to you as it takes

43:27.600 --> 43:32.640
your it takes your guardian away if I told the story before about the time I

43:32.640 --> 43:37.120
thought we were gonna crash in a plane my friend Frank maybe but dude I think we

43:37.120 --> 43:42.080
should hear it I'm gonna pour a drink will you tell it the the theme of the

43:42.080 --> 43:47.920
story was that you're amazing and you don't fear death no yeah I'll take you

43:47.920 --> 43:52.200
to the very end of it it was like we were gonna land in Chicago we couldn't

43:52.200 --> 43:56.200
so we went to Indiana if I told the story a thousand times I think just once

43:56.200 --> 44:03.120
in the very end it was the women that were the flight attendants that were

44:03.120 --> 44:07.920
on board that made everybody feel safe and we felt secure and happy because

44:07.920 --> 44:11.840
these women that were like veteran like flight attendants have been through it

44:11.840 --> 44:17.240
all we go if they're not nervous we're not nervous and when we landed the

44:17.240 --> 44:25.920
woman came on the comm and said we're back in Indiana oh my god and that's

44:25.920 --> 44:33.960
when that's when we all shit our pants because like oh she was nervous too like

44:33.960 --> 44:37.960
like she we we all thought we're gonna die we thought she didn't think we were

44:37.960 --> 44:41.320
gonna die right then we found out she thought we were going to die and she is

44:41.320 --> 44:45.640
a fucking badass like she's John Wayne from fucking the like the longest day

44:45.640 --> 44:51.600
like we're all we all thought we were gonna die and she told us so at the

44:51.600 --> 44:58.240
very end oh god damn it let it go it's the kid let it go okay this is a nice

44:58.240 --> 45:05.360
segue into our next segment which is Dan recommends podcast yeah do you know

45:05.360 --> 45:13.680
the etymology of the word posh night I know I thought it was a spice it's an

45:13.680 --> 45:19.280
acronym mm-hmm I listen in this new true crying podcast that's two British

45:19.280 --> 45:27.840
ladies and one of them shared this posh is an acronym for in in the olden days

45:27.840 --> 45:33.920
when getting too much Sun was a definite gateway to being perceived as poor and

45:33.920 --> 45:41.280
people started to travel by boat like as an upper-class thing you it was about

45:41.280 --> 45:45.240
the strategy of when to keep the Sun on your face and when to keep it off your

45:45.240 --> 45:52.600
face posh stands for port side over starboard home it's the side of the boat

45:52.600 --> 45:57.800
that you sit on you don't want to get too much of a tan wait across crossing

45:57.800 --> 46:00.720
over from England side over to the continent to wherever you're going so

46:00.720 --> 46:06.840
left side going out right home to keep the Sun off you I guess right that

46:06.840 --> 46:12.000
would be the shady side of the product yes that's one of those things like

46:12.000 --> 46:19.800
where people what is crazy spice stands for and that segues me into like my

46:19.800 --> 46:24.000
signal boost podcast of the like I've listened to so many true crime podcasts

46:24.000 --> 46:28.920
but like I can't like like I found this one red-handed it's these two British

46:28.920 --> 46:36.920
ladies and I like in the height of my enthusiasm for them I'll give them the

46:36.920 --> 46:42.560
offer that I've given to David Cummings to come out was like sheroody and Hannah

46:42.560 --> 46:47.880
if if this gets back to you and you want to fly first class to the states and

46:47.880 --> 46:52.360
gonna be a guest on the show like I'll like worth it you've given me so much

46:52.360 --> 46:55.600
like I'd love to chat with you also any of our fans if you want to come out

46:55.600 --> 47:00.680
first-class damn I'm gonna pay for you no not not anybody it's this is my thing

47:00.680 --> 47:05.760
as I extend this invitation to certain people I it's just such an amazing if

47:05.760 --> 47:09.680
it in this world of like I don't know when true crime is gonna hit its peak I

47:09.680 --> 47:13.840
think it's so funny like I just me and Cody listen to true crime podcasts it's

47:13.840 --> 47:18.640
all we do we gobble them up we run out of everyone and like every single one is

47:18.640 --> 47:24.560
on a different podcast network and every single podcast network has advertisements

47:24.560 --> 47:28.000
for different ones where they're like hey just a couple words from some of our

47:28.000 --> 47:32.280
friends I was like I can't it seems like there's got to be more true crime

47:32.280 --> 47:36.920
podcasts than there are people willing to listen or that have ever been murdered

47:36.920 --> 47:42.400
by anything it's so but I haven't hit my peak I just keep going all right let's

47:42.400 --> 47:46.720
listen to them like these advertisements the one thing that's really funny to me

47:46.720 --> 47:53.040
is I kind of want to grab people and shake them and go please stop pretending

47:53.040 --> 48:02.160
this isn't ghoulish I guess the new wave is like hey we're gonna talk about true

48:02.160 --> 48:06.800
crime you're gonna hear about strangulation and rape and murder but

48:06.800 --> 48:13.320
it's because victims need not be forgotten like like they put this twist on

48:13.320 --> 48:16.640
it where it's like we're doing a service I'm like well maybe you are maybe you're

48:16.640 --> 48:22.240
not but come on that's not what this come on I mean I'll go to sleep on my

48:22.240 --> 48:26.000
couch and watch some date lines but I cannot do the Keith Morrison the fucking

48:26.000 --> 48:32.120
guy I fucking want to I feel I feel like I feel like like perfectly good about

48:32.120 --> 48:38.520
people that are like oh well we should make sure I'm going to keep doing my

48:38.520 --> 48:44.240
Keith Morrison that's wonderful but is is it good to do a Keith

48:44.240 --> 48:49.440
Morrison passion while Dan Harmon is talking yeah we don't know maybe it's

48:49.440 --> 48:59.840
not I listen to the world may know I've been listening to this podcast called the

48:59.840 --> 49:04.160
dream podcast and I recommend it highly it's about multi-level marketing and how

49:04.160 --> 49:09.600
it affects people and it's crazy it's apparently all a big scam the only

49:09.600 --> 49:13.560
reason it's still around today is because there's this big court case that

49:13.560 --> 49:17.840
the people were about to go to jail but they have like deep ties to like the

49:17.840 --> 49:20.760
government and stuff so they kind of like got the court case thrown out and

49:20.760 --> 49:24.560
then in that court case they were like well check it out here's the rules for

49:24.560 --> 49:29.400
what is an isn't a multi-level marketing scam and we don't do that so we're in

49:29.400 --> 49:32.760
the clear and they're like yep you're in the clear and then it turned out they

49:32.760 --> 49:37.120
made up those rules to prove that they didn't and no one has rules on what is

49:37.120 --> 49:41.160
there isn't a multi-leveling scam so like that's now the new legal definition is

49:41.160 --> 49:46.360
what the MLMs like made to be to avoid and they're like we aren't that and

49:46.360 --> 49:50.640
that's why we're not breaking the law but it's just fundamentally a fraud by

49:50.640 --> 49:54.880
the mechanics of the business itself and the only reason that it can't always

49:54.880 --> 49:59.080
be prosecuted is because there's not always sufficient evidence to prosecute

49:59.080 --> 50:02.560
businesses of stuff but it's all fundamentally a fraud and it's crazy

50:02.560 --> 50:06.400
because it's like it's all this crazy capitalist stuff where everyone's just

50:06.400 --> 50:10.240
like preying on people as a business and it gets into like sexism because

50:10.240 --> 50:13.600
there's all these men who pray on women and get them involved and so they're

50:13.600 --> 50:18.000
making men money for the men but it like it's secret and so it's like this weird

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
thing that affects like women and I don't know it just it takes money out of

50:22.000 --> 50:25.400
both sides of the family it's just this really insidious thing that seemed to

50:25.400 --> 50:29.920
completely grasp all of American business and now American politics and it's

50:29.920 --> 50:34.480
it's I don't know it's like you find out like every problem we have is kind of

50:34.480 --> 50:38.120
all connected to the same problems and it's like holy shit to the idea that we

50:38.120 --> 50:43.400
we aren't able to recognize what is essentially a not even capitalism it's

50:43.400 --> 50:46.360
like a pyramid scheme or yeah well that's the thing is that like the

50:46.360 --> 50:49.680
multi-level market at the marketing companies that have gotten away with it

50:49.680 --> 50:54.080
for so long

50:54.080 --> 51:01.760
but basically we could make that work we just need to keep it rolling for a long

51:01.760 --> 51:07.960
don't make it yeah no I know I'm trying I'm trying to be helpful no but I hit

51:07.960 --> 51:18.320
the thing my accent no no I believe it I lost my turn of thought anyway you you

51:18.320 --> 51:21.960
burden of proof is on you to prove that you're not just jealous of Spencer

51:21.960 --> 51:29.080
taking the conch no I was trying to look for it the the DND theme in case we

51:29.080 --> 51:32.280
want to play yeah that makes some well that actually now brings to mind like

51:32.280 --> 51:35.720
you were gonna do that and it was gonna kind of you that was Spencer face you

51:35.720 --> 51:39.320
were gonna commit Spencer face I was I was scrolling through and I hit the I hit

51:39.320 --> 51:53.120
the wrong thing you back me up on this airline thing oh yeah I was just trying

51:53.120 --> 51:57.760
to do my job as a control that one's good okay look here's the thing it's

51:57.760 --> 52:03.280
2019 like I'm not a big resolution guy but like something that like I've been

52:03.280 --> 52:08.640
really remiss about we've been as we've gone on we love doing this podcast it's

52:08.640 --> 52:13.040
amazing we've concretized it we've incorporated it whatever we're trying

52:13.040 --> 52:18.240
to make it like a self-sufficient like little bio dome of like pod castry

52:18.240 --> 52:22.400
everybody that works on it hopefully is getting paid to work on it part of part

52:22.400 --> 52:26.360
of that was like coming up with paperwork and signing contracts it's an arduous

52:26.360 --> 52:30.320
process takes the joy out of everything of course you can't just like do

52:30.320 --> 52:35.480
something for fun and someone's gonna get end up getting fucked over we we've

52:35.480 --> 52:39.640
been trying for years now like we like oh it's our business it's Harmontown

52:39.640 --> 52:44.480
incorporated and give this to that person give that the last person along the

52:44.480 --> 52:48.720
way I think one of the funnier things it's like one of our silent partners

52:48.720 --> 52:54.560
Kevin Day who runs the ins and outs of like you know like like pumping the

52:54.560 --> 53:00.280
show out he's he's like I don't I don't want to I don't want to make him a

53:00.280 --> 53:04.000
target but he's pretty Bitcoin rich he's like kind of like he doesn't really

53:04.000 --> 53:08.080
need the five the bottom line is like at what a certain point during the

53:08.080 --> 53:13.920
incorporation of the podcast he's sort of like yeah I have a problem I I need

53:13.920 --> 53:18.080
some of the money to go away like like and we came up with this thing Kevin can

53:18.080 --> 53:33.000
you can you come up can you come up and talk about our thing so we had talked

53:33.000 --> 53:37.440
about like because basically like if you were to do nothing at all given your

53:37.440 --> 53:42.040
situation if you're taking money from the business venture that we had to

53:42.040 --> 53:45.760
create in order to make the thing you would get penalized that's this is a

53:45.760 --> 53:50.040
common theme of capitalism yes you need a write-off you need a thing and you're

53:50.040 --> 53:53.520
like look here's this here's something that we can't do both ethically and

53:53.520 --> 53:58.600
legally we can't say to our podcast audience if you subscribe to the podcast

53:58.600 --> 54:05.240
some of your money will go to take care of Down syndrome which many podcasts do

54:05.240 --> 54:08.960
but is illegal I think well whether it's illegal or not I don't actually know

54:08.960 --> 54:12.880
about the legality of it but I do know that actually as a as a pseudo

54:12.880 --> 54:18.640
capitalist I would actually say honestly you know if you're asking someone for

54:18.640 --> 54:24.200
five dollars shouldn't they have a choice as to whether or not one of their

54:24.200 --> 54:30.880
five dollars goes to this or that but but what we came upon was like you're

54:30.880 --> 54:34.640
you're gonna suffer in silence unless we give some of your money away every

54:34.640 --> 54:39.440
month correct and so we came up with this idea it's like let's pick a charity

54:39.440 --> 54:43.400
every month and we can renew it at the end of every month but let's pick let's

54:43.400 --> 54:48.000
pick something that your money goes to because you don't need it and you need

54:48.000 --> 54:51.600
to write it off let's just get it out of your hands so you don't get penalized

54:51.600 --> 54:55.700
for it right like what I really wanted to do was like what other podcasts do was

54:55.700 --> 54:59.240
say that we were gonna donate 10% of whatever to some charity and as you

54:59.240 --> 55:03.400
brought up that's a really bad idea because people might cancel you know

55:03.400 --> 55:06.440
they don't want to subscribe yeah I would like to think that there is such a

55:06.440 --> 55:10.480
thing as a Republican Harmontown fan who's like look I don't truck with this

55:10.480 --> 55:16.280
or that but like don't don't put me in a position where I feel like literally my

55:16.280 --> 55:21.360
money helps something that I don't believe in if they want to listen to me

55:21.360 --> 55:25.040
to say they're stupid and pay five dollars like that should be there right

55:25.040 --> 55:29.720
yeah right feels like an ethical thing to me it's where ethics and capitalism

55:29.720 --> 55:34.360
intersect so and so and so I think the nice thing is that we go look this is a

55:34.360 --> 55:39.920
if you're if you're a right-wing person and you're like I don't want my money

55:39.920 --> 55:43.480
going to anything but trust me your money's going to me and Jeff getting

55:43.480 --> 55:53.560
drunk and dying I promise anything left over where it's it's it's supposed it's

55:53.560 --> 55:59.280
going to a private citizen who's our silent partner Kevin Day Kevin now who

55:59.280 --> 56:03.560
has no political affiliation he doesn't care he what he said to me is he's

56:03.560 --> 56:07.720
willing to we're going to find a charity eat every once in a while we're going to

56:07.720 --> 56:11.000
funnel your money into that charity right I'm donating the money but I'm

56:11.000 --> 56:18.080
letting Dan pick where it goes okay it's all going to the Proud Boys they just

56:18.080 --> 56:24.720
they just if they could read they they just not fair what's happening we try

56:24.720 --> 56:32.080
to represent the now we will do it now we are gonna it's too late now we're

56:32.080 --> 56:39.280
giving the money to the Proud Boys for real I honestly do think as a side

56:39.280 --> 56:42.160
argument that that's probably the quickest way to diffuse some of these

56:42.160 --> 56:46.800
pockets of toxic dudes is that you actually just give them a million dollars

56:46.800 --> 56:50.040
because the wouldn't they just it would be Sierra Madre they would just kill

56:50.040 --> 56:55.680
each other going I want this big of a flesh like no it should be like they'd

56:55.680 --> 56:59.560
be like no it's too dark I want it to be whiter and they'll be like fuck you

56:59.560 --> 57:04.840
racist they just like you could give give bad people a million dollars they're

57:04.840 --> 57:10.920
toast but we're not doing that I here's my my thing that I've always been

57:10.920 --> 57:14.320
passionate about always been passionate about giant air quotes because I do

57:14.320 --> 57:19.080
nothing to do anything but like maybe this mechanism could help us or I said

57:19.080 --> 57:23.760
to you prison reform this is the thing that I'm like really like kind of like

57:23.760 --> 57:32.600
I because I feel like it's like easy to not do like I feel awful about the fact

57:32.600 --> 57:37.120
that we when somebody fucks up in life I don't care how bad they are I don't

57:37.120 --> 57:39.760
care how evil they are it's not about whether you're a good person or bad

57:39.760 --> 57:45.080
person if you end up in our system like where we have decided as a society this

57:45.080 --> 57:49.640
is how it works I don't like the fact that you get locked up and then your

57:49.640 --> 57:53.920
nightmare begins and that and that you're like deprived of shit that like

57:53.920 --> 57:58.720
maybe could help you like I don't I like like I don't like that you can't get

57:58.720 --> 58:02.680
D&D books in prison I don't like that you I don't I don't I don't like that we

58:02.680 --> 58:05.960
joke about oh well where you're going you're gonna get raped every day and

58:05.960 --> 58:09.560
it's like well that one's not part of the judge's sentence but I just in

58:09.560 --> 58:14.400
general I think we have like a fucked up twisted idea of like it's like if we're

58:14.400 --> 58:20.840
a society that's gonna lock up almost all the people in the world like it

58:20.840 --> 58:26.160
that's my thing I realized so I told you that like two hours ago I was like look

58:26.160 --> 58:32.400
up prison reform yes and so we may pick a charity tonight where we're like sounds

58:32.400 --> 58:36.840
like this alright here's where Kevin Day's money is going and on the reddit

58:36.840 --> 58:42.520
you may go I looked them up they're terrible they're fake okay let's find

58:42.520 --> 58:47.400
that out in real time let's let's let's popularize the idea of charity shopping

58:47.400 --> 58:54.120
so I came down to two options I wanted to give you the first is the probably more

58:54.120 --> 58:57.120
well-known and much bigger but not exactly what you were asking for is

58:57.120 --> 59:01.240
called the innocence project right and their job is mostly they do to people

59:01.240 --> 59:04.640
who basically everybody looks at and goes there's no way this person was

59:04.640 --> 59:09.160
guilty but they're sat with a life prison prison sentence they don't you know

59:09.160 --> 59:14.360
get sentences overturned and right they're very big and they also need to

59:14.360 --> 59:17.080
be one of the most effective charities and they've they've regularly been

59:17.080 --> 59:22.920
recognized for dollars going to them does the most good I don't want to okay

59:22.920 --> 59:27.920
gut thank you for yeah I'm is I am actually more invested in like how do

59:27.920 --> 59:34.360
we treat like the bad people I I want the guilty people to not have to like in

59:34.360 --> 59:39.360
addition to doing their time and serving there so I would like it if they could

59:39.360 --> 59:44.240
like fucking learn a trade and like and like not live in fear but yes I love

59:44.240 --> 59:49.000
the innocence project obviously and arguably a great thing but right so the

59:49.000 --> 59:51.800
one closer I think what you're asking for is a similar project called the

59:51.800 --> 59:57.080
sentencing project that seems to have two goals one is to give make sure people

59:57.080 --> 01:00:01.040
get fair sentences because too often people are you know thrown in some

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.520
maximum security prison for something that was not needed and second that one

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.200
of their goals is while people are incarcerated making sure that prisons

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:14.440
are not more likely to produce good results and people are let out you know

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:19.040
making sure things are not cruel making sure education is available making sure

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.000
that you know job training is made available and things like that so they

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.600
sort of seem to have a two-pronged approach of make sure people's sentences

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.760
are appropriate how do they do that in a world where it's like state-to-state

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:36.480
city-to-city like how do they um from the literal five minutes I've read about

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.480
them that's part of the joke is that I made you do this because I'm so

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:48.160
charitable that I'm like this lazy they meet with district attorneys a lot they

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.520
have provided information to states and counties and things like that about you

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.360
know are you aware of the sentencing guidelines you guys have and what that

01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.440
produces and how this person here because of the guidelines that that

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:06.000
exist in this jurisdiction result in a 20-year maximum security you never see

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.920
your friends the entire time you're in jail when other states are doing things

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.960
more fairly and here's how well this has worked and here you know so they

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.640
present information to the people who make sentencing decisions to allow them

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.280
some of the visibility they may not see themselves it's like an awareness thing

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:26.880
almost where they're like hey judge hang them high yes and hey a prosecuting

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:31.540
attorney hang them high like you you're getting votes and you're getting

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.720
promotions by this idea that you're tough on crime but but it's not working can

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.240
we make you aware of the fact that it's slowly making your city for instance

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.160
like have like recidivism rates that are super high correct and they they've

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.920
also done work to where you know they've taken prisoner complaints that have gone

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:54.400
unheard of you know this this policy this prison has is unfair and just mean

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.520
spirited for no good reason and they've stepped in they filed lawsuits they've

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:03.320
helped people how do we penetrate that barrier where like once you get locked

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:09.520
up everybody outside is like fuck that person and you're like can I get a

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.480
toothbrush and they're like fuck you and then someone's like I want to beat you

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.800
up because you're Dan Harmon and you've been locked up and you're like whoa this

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.360
isn't part of my sentence and they're like who cares like how can we make

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:26.720
prisons less of a nightmare so I can proceed to get locked up I wish I had

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:30.840
the answer yeah I know okay I in the meantime like yeah I guess out of the

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:36.880
out of those two the sentencing thing like like sure I guess if those guys

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:41.680
have funding they're gonna be able to talk more to more bureaucrats let's give

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:48.360
them a month or let's say a month because a week is not long enough so it's not

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.120
if you're listening to the podcast your money isn't your money isn't going

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.080
anywhere your money is going into Harmontown's pocket same as always I'm

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:02.320
only letting you know as part of the show that one of the people that takes

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.080
the money from your pocket after everything's done is gonna get fucked on

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:12.200
his taxes and so he's gonna for this month give it to this random charity which

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.880
is called the sentencing projects and we'll maybe at the end of the maybe a

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.800
month from now we'll go here's how much money we gave them and maybe we'll look

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.240
into it I actually honestly think I'm not putting it on them but I feel like

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.520
the natural mechanism of the reddit kind of mentality is someone's gonna want to

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.480
take this shit down which I think could be a healthy mechanism it's like an

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.560
enzyme like they'll research the organization let's find out like

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.200
charities like let's find charities that we that really do great like for

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.600
every every dollar that you give them what are they really doing to change your

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.080
human life and stuff so let's find ones that we're fans of and this will be the

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.580
first start of the project like let's not be afraid to do it wrong I some of

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:56.480
the some of that some of the guy that's why I don't even go down that road is

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.760
I'm like I don't know what to do like I got high with a guy the other day

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.880
explained to me that Red Cross is like the fucking oh yeah

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:08.000
kleptocracy it's crazy it kind of sterilized or paralyzes you charities in

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.400
America you're like yeah I don't want to do anything yeah you know and like it

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.880
should be the opposite of that it should be like a it should be like your

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.480
natural state should be like yeah whatever you should be kind of exuding

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:26.720
shit yeah like in a post-patreon world have you gone to proudboys.com I feel

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:31.120
like yeah okay well so yeah anything else you want to talk about Kevin come

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:37.640
on share your deepest thoughts my deepest thoughts hi no don't listen to him

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:44.320
he's it's like he can't he can't control himself yeah I've been hearing you live

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:52.160
in Chicago usually I do I do you seem like a secretive guy like you help me

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:56.320
we said about that I feel go by the Bears yet the other day I'm not a big

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.560
football fan good good for you no yeah yeah we talked about the fact that the

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.480
way that we really came did we talk about this in the podcast where you were

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:12.760
like hey do you own a MacBook Pro and an iPad too and a thing and I like a list

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:17.400
of nine things I was like yeah and you're like yeah Cameron Diaz had you in

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.520
her phone and like you're part of like FAP gate or whatever you need to change

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:26.760
your passwords like and I was like yeah do you want me to explain that sure okay

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:36.600
I think I just did but I was there and I didn't get that but damn I got it but I

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:42.280
know what happened already so many a few years ago there was some kind of high

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.680
profile cases where celebrities were getting their iCloud and other accounts

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:51.120
hacked and well what these attackers were doing and they were multiple would

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.840
they would break into one person's you know they would guess your iCloud

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.320
password and once they've done that they can download a list of all of your

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:03.320
contacts all of your pictures all of your email a lot of really bad things of

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:08.120
Dan's you don't want to see look I might take away as Cameron Diaz has me in her

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:13.320
phone right so what what happened you know they would break into one person's

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:17.560
phone and then from that they would get a whole list of new email addresses and

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.120
everything else and they would use that to break into others and break into

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:25.640
others and a friend of mine who owns a bunch of web servers called me one day

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.120
and said hey this one web server is acting really weird it's making all

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.200
these connections to iCloud and we can't figure out why and we went and

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.680
looked at it and realized that it was being used to break into other people's

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.960
accounts and I had met Dan before and was looking through all the list of

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:46.520
people that it had broken into and I was looking at all of Dan's personal

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:51.800
information and so reached out to Dan and went you really need to change your

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:56.760
iCloud password because I got it I got everything yeah yeah what what did you

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:05.640
see everything no I made it a point not to specifically look but just enough to

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:15.120
prove that what did you see that picture you was safe don't worry

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:19.160
I like to think and I remember calling you when the Sony hack happened I was like

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:24.560
Kevin yes what is happening with the Sony yeah the North Korean Sony hack

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:30.120
whatever like like I was like I was in a fucking full-blown panic here's why

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:35.800
because if all of Sony's emails were hacked that that includes every email

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:41.080
that's received by Sony that means that like I didn't know that the press and

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:47.320
that the public was capable of being that like like like that level of

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:53.600
piglety like where it was like hey there's no yeah these hackers like dump

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.680
to this file online let's walk you through all of it and the way like Amy

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:00.720
Pascal was like like hung out to dry was like we're actually like what you're

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:06.560
proving here is that this this lady that like ran a studio that she made one joke

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:11.160
that was like wouldn't it be off-color if I said this to Obama it's like it's not

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:17.640
11 right now by the way great I was like I was like holy shit if one email that I

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:23.360
ever sent to anybody at Sony you like ever gets in the hands of TMZ like I'm

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.800
so fucked like it would be such a weird out of context thing and I remember

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.520
emailing you and like going like just tell me like I just want to go know if I

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.280
need to go home and blow my brains out and you're like there was one his his

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:41.680
email inbox was deleted at the time but and there's one I did do a search there's

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:48.640
one reference to you it said that you're you're a wild card it was just like them

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:53.160
talking about me I was like oh it's badass yeah pretty much like a single a

01:08:53.160 --> 01:09:00.000
single email that's notable though because it's like it's not it was like

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.840
this thing ethical about that like like look I like I'm just saying like if you

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:11.400
printed an email that I had sent to Sony while I was producing community it

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:17.600
would it would be grounds for like crucifying me I feel by our standards

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:23.760
but it's like I know the word context is now like a dinner bell that's rung by

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:28.440
old fat white guys it's like you don't understand but it's like wait a minute

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:33.240
like I the idea that I was a megalomaniac saying to a corporation don't

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.360
ever fucking tell me what to do or I'll fucking punch your teeth down your

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:40.680
throat like like at the time when I was typing that it felt like a really heroic

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.880
thing to be typing and six years later the idea that that would be able to be

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:52.680
pod through by these clearly inscrubulous like oh I'm the rap.org and I'm

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:58.480
oh I'm banana peel net net like like it was like oh look at what this guy said I

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.600
was like terrified I guess I've been terrified ever since if it helped you

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:08.720
sounded more sad than anything there was only one email about you yeah no I don't

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:23.720
know I was relieved believe me and digital and whatever. All right let's go there for Kevin Day everybody. Kevin Day.

coin or a diet who can go first oh we're competing against each other yeah

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:43.320
this is the first time by the way Dan and I have competed against each other

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:49.120
since get this there's a male review dance review you know what I mean

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:54.160

Farley and Patrick no no no not like that body body shape wise this is more

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:10.320

the last time we actually competed in something that it was either you or me

is still this would be a highlight for fucking anyone I mean Dan fucking yo

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:27.520

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:50.560
get into you met Torrey Amos yes oh yes yes in fact two years before MTV this is

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.240
in like Wallingford Connecticut I snuck into a Torrey Amos concert at like you

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:58.600
know how you have maximum minimum security prisons what there used to be

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:04.440
this this like place like 3,000 person place in Wallingford can anyway you

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:07.880
could like anyone can sneak into this thing was that's Connecticut Connecticut

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:13.920
is like minimum security concert venues you know but that's so you why are we on

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:17.840
that I don't know that was on me I mean sorry so you're with you're with Torrey

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:22.680
Amos like oh yeah two years later I'm in her hotel room smoking smoking

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:28.200
slipping on gin and juice laid back what does she like what is your late

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:33.400
girl smells like corn flakes but in a good way like I ain't talking like those

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:39.280
soggy-ass corn flakes I'm talking Crispin this is I'm presented with a video of

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:43.400
you and Torrey Amos on my iPhone it's Google a bowl

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:54.880
this is a we're playing a video of you this is you and Torrey Amos and I know

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:59.040
this is gonna sound crazy but in the video you're wearing a ridiculous hat

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:06.960
so I thought I bring it around I thought I'd break out another crazy hat and this

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:11.840
is pretty crazy this this hat got 5150 but wait Jesse so let me tell you like

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:19.160
like I reference the idea like like so is it is it accurate to say your forced

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:24.640
gump adventure begins with this like MTV contest pro like like like but I had a

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:28.640
Jenny to you know but obviously you had gumption otherwise you wouldn't have won

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:33.480
that contest I did have gumption you beat my friend who was like I had to bubble

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:39.120
gum to establish himself as the dick Clark oh yeah I tell you all about that

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.640
because the media always tries to pit us against each other like they like

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:49.160
Duff Lundgren versus still best alone my question is so obviously like Wesley

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:58.760
Snipes versus the IRS but coming yeah but coming to that stage yeah obviously

01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:02.560
we're already a step and I shot that's crazy you should bring that up Dan we

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:09.720
shot a coming to America type movie on the Arsenio Hall to Dave's Eddie Murphy

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:14.720
and he played like a guy from Poland and then I was I guess his helper it was

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:18.760
very like black sheep Chris Farley David Spade we made a movie together it's

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:23.840
never gonna come out because that was back when Dave was going through satanic

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:29.960
period well now he was wick so he didn't show up in half the dailies but

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:36.280
number two he was also into a really heavy wicker candle period he was making

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:40.840
can we talk about your trousers right yeah I'm sorry for going off the rails

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:46.800
on a crazy train yeah but these tights but that crazy train leads back to the

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:54.120
station and that station is located in Harmontown yeah I want to know I want to

01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:59.880
know like the Lee obviously I've listened to preachers I don't Jesse went

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:05.080
I'm coming up he goes he goes hey Jeff you want to come to the whiskey a go-go

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:10.480
tonight we're gonna go see LA guns and we any yeah of course we get backstage

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.760
and we're hanging out with Phil Lewis who's the fucking grievous the man but

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:18.160
like like to go to a rock show stole Rod Stewart's girlfriend back in the day he

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:22.760
fucking did he fucking did yeah but to go backstage at a rock show with Jesse is

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:27.560
like to be on a magic carpet ride of rock and roll like fucking fantasy well

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.400
because so here's a question I want to ask you anything why aren't you a snob

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.840
because you're clearly not a snob because you're not you're not doing a

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:40.240
life humbles me a lot when you because you're like a lot of people who have

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:44.120
encyclopedic knowledge of things like yeah they make their bones by going like

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:50.920
well I I talked to you about Phil Collins yeah a lot of people that question but

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:56.440
yeah I want to know like like so you're the skeleton key you're like this

01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:01.120
ultimate fan you like that's your charisma those things is there's such a

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:07.920
thing as a bad thing for you like don't worry about you I'm talking about as a

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.920
consumer I'm saying okay it's like if I say Phil Collins to you I did a movie with

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.480
Charles grown bad move yeah you're you're like Phil Collins he did this he did

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.340
that I say Tori Amos to you yeah I've only said the two things I tell you

01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:26.720
honest stories to you is could I say something to you that would make you go

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:32.320
oh fuck that that's bullshit you know like minuto or like I tell you welcome

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.040
one thing I'm glad you bring that up one pet peeve of mine although I think the

01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:40.560
public definitely cried out against it but it didn't need to be that mean to it

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:46.120
but it was very ill-conceived the Steve Carell movie welcome to Mavine about how

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:51.560
he basically so he's let's just go there with this real quick he is a man that

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:55.360
was at like a like a bar like a rough kind of bar and he was just telling all

01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:01.440
the rough locals that he that he got that he wanted to be a cross dresser or

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:05.360
something and so I don't know the alcohol got in them you know and they

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.520
they like beat him well within an inch of his life like this group of people in

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:13.320
England so then this dude is brain damage but goes to heal in this world

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:17.520
where he gets a lot of like GI Joe and weird like action figures and builds an

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:21.280
imaginary life about that with him in it and this movie is two and a half hours

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:25.320
and it's called welcome to Mavine and it like had a $60 million budget and I

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:30.360
think it brought in maybe 1.2 million what you mean Marwin yeah Marwin I'm

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:37.040
sorry I got that confused with Aquaman wait but you say you're saying okay

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:41.880
there's shitty movies I don't recommend it yeah I mean I can't believe playing

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.680
paint what that was Jesse remember New Year's Eve 2000 whatever

01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:49.960

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:53.560
joint and at the hard rock and oh this is a great story I'm glad we circled back

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:59.280
and it's this is a beautiful time around the time that the white stripes were

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:02.680
breaking this is when the strokes were happening this is when inner pool we're

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:07.240

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.920
fingerprint analysis with each other yeah yeah inner pole was like coming up

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:15.240

Jesse Jesse I don't know her but when she gets into your heart you never win

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:20.000
the same but now I know she's got a built-in ability to take everything you

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:26.840
see and now I know I'm falling I'm falling for her she seems to have an

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:34.520
invisible touch head hey yeah all right sorry it was it was specifically your

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:42.400
indulgence that triggered us to start one time what time do we all go back to

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:46.560
New Year's Eve though okay all right now now thank you thank you now the band

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:52.120
Felper revolver on stage it's the late great Scott Wilde of STP looking like

01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:57.880
anorexic Finn he's got like one of them like police caps on his head like a

01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:07.320
Nazi like officer hat on yeah okay yeah very kind of cold okay sure like faster

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:11.920
pussy cat kind of thing yeah take me down ish yeah just six million down so

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:17.160
we're sitting there and we're watching it it's like it's like 1145 form as well

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:23.880
and then a weird like man like a mr. clean but with a mustache dude Dave

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:29.760
Kushner nice which is now a marijuana strain what did I tell you shut up those

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:35.040
yeah yeah so anyway so we're watching it and it sucks and Jesse and I just

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:39.360
happened to be there we're like oh we're like four like four seats away and I

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.760
look I look over at Jesse and Jesse's looking at me and I go what do you think

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:48.440
about this because it's like 10 minutes to midnight on New Year's Eve and Jesse

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:56.080
looks at me he goes they fucking suck man I go that's what I want I want to hear

01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:00.200
what you think sucks hang on I said I said beautiful boy Steve Carell's other

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:04.680
movie okay I'm gonna just say that no Jesse it may be a beautiful story but

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:10.000
like I don't really find it believable that there is a child born in Marin

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.280
County California that's addicted to Crystal Street meth don't buy that when

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:22.760
Adderall is so readily available I just that's a big leap of faith in the plot

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:27.440
that I really gotta you know but if we're gonna talk about prison reform how

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:32.120
unfair the justice system is and how redlined and rigged it is against people

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:37.760
of color you know and believe me too it's not you know black lives matter but

01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.920
it's like when it comes to the poor no lives matter and we as a nation got to

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:46.000
like come up on that and when we do prison reform is part of that you know

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.440
but this is what I'm getting at and I think I remember what I'm getting at

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:55.840
and I'm trying to stall right now buffering buffering Jeff I can't believe

01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:02.560
that I'm having a senior moment at the age of 39 but it happened no I'm just

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:07.680
kidding I'm just being false humble but let me tell you that no I am having a

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:10.960
senior moment it's tough to know I'm going in and out of it but I do remember

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:16.560
we were talking about Amy Grant and how beautiful and wholesome she was kind of

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:20.400
like Tori Amos before all the kids with Dean McDermott can you put Jesse on the

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.800
on the vocoder like oh yeah but did we get to the punchline of the Velvet

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.920
revolver concert that everyone is so invested in knowing the ending of Jeff

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:36.440
I said they I kind of think they suck man and I look down I go like what

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:40.680
because all this talent is on stage you got all these great rock stars I go what

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:46.960
is it that they're not doing and Jesse brought me goes where's the songs he

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:51.280
goes they got no songs and that was fucking brilliant yeah I mean and we

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:58.240
stood up oh shit we proceeded to party the rest of the night with carrot top

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:04.560
our brother party and with carrot top into Harmontown yet why the fuck not

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:09.320
we know he's got fun props I love the top yo the top I love the top I think the

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:13.480
top could work a room that's like audio and I can't see the problem ever meet

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:16.640
the top of the chart prison your life and carrot top he's let's answer the

01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:21.760
question where are the songs let's hit it hit it for the hard-working prop

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:27.680
comic yeah no no hit hit something no hit a different less percussive it's more

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:32.200
about singing than rapping where are the songs is the question where the song

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:38.240
revolver had a great song slip slither which but other than that there was

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:42.080
really a lot of filler on that album you know so like there's one kind of like

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:47.480
a painful yo tell me your velvet okay and then we get over because we're with

richardsy let me just preface this

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:35.920
green room is filled with peyote the original Indian from the village people

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:40.040
Greg is back there and he's smoking everyone out with peyote so that was just

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:45.840
me going way to the dark side I think that's a teachable moment and in fact

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:50.320
right now we were trying to make this song much like the end by the doors you

01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:54.960

and son kids like this is you each other with like father somebody that's

01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:05.040
really what we were going for this was a play this was a one-act Dan and I wrote

01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:11.240
this all over the New Year's weekend so again you know just a hero villain story

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:23.240
relationship with you Dan and I are both about monogamy we are both about

01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:27.320
wearing special layers of underwear if that helps with the intimacy you know

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:32.760
we are gentlemen we do not mean to say that we wanted to plow your field that

01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:38.440
was a miss quote that was a Sony email that we sent to Seth Rogan about his

01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:43.440

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:48.080
