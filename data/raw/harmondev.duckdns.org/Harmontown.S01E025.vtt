00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello Austin, Texas.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Harmontown is now officially in session.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Thank you so much for coming out.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Day two of the Harmontown tour.

00:27.000 --> 00:38.000
Please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Holy shit! Holy shit!

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Holy shit!

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
Big room full of amazing people. Holy shit. Amazing.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Thank you. You're applauding yourselves, you sons of bitches.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
God damn it, we're never leaving this city.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
We had a great time in Phoenix. We learned some painful lessons, mostly about myself.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
They were good people in Phoenix. I made a complete ass of myself going out there.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
They loved me, and I flung myself under the sharpened rocks of my own self-hatred.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
In a regular show, a comic could come out and go,

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Hey, knock knock, who's there? Your mom's there?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
And then there'd be a guy in the audience that go,

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
You suck! That's the dynamic, that's what a heckler is.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
It's completely inverted with me because I have no act,

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
and then I come up and go, I'm a bad person, and then people in the audience go,

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
You're doing fine!

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
We love you!

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Season two of Community made me cry!

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Just keep going, and I start going,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Fuck you, fuck you, pal! What do you know?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Dan actually started heckling the audience's love.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
I did, I really did, and it was, you know, the show in Phoenix went fine,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
but I learned my lesson, it was like, you know what?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Let's accept some love as we go out here on the road,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
because I was, you know, the automatic thought was like,

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
we live in Los Angeles and we live in the back of a comic book store, we do the show,

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
and now we're going on the road, so your automatic thought is,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
my mom's out there, you know, like she's somewhere out there,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
these are different people, like they're gonna judge me,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
or like the crowds are gonna be filled with people who are like,

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
you know, let's go see some comedy tonight, honey.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Who's this guy? What's he doing?

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
But you all listen to the podcast, right?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
So, we're fine, we're fine.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
And my only job is to pretend that we're in Los Angeles, at Harmontown.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I think what we found last night, to our surprise,

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
and I think what we're gonna find as we go is that the people that come to the show

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
are gonna resemble our hometown crowd for a bit.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Pretty much, like they're all, they look a lot like,

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
I walk in the door in Austin or Phoenix,

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
and the guy I make eye contact with who's holding the thing for me to sign

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
is the same guy as in Los Angeles, like, he might be,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
he might look like he could kick my ass, he might have tattoos,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
he might have glasses, he might be short, he might be fat, he might be thin,

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
but there's that misfit quality, and then our eyes meet across the room,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
and happened with some guy, I think his name was Jesse or something,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
it was the first guy I came into the, I came into the, there was a guy,

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
I was like, hey, kind of waved at me like I worked with him,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
and I was like, yeah, hey, and I knew, I don't work with you,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
but it's like the different patterns of facial hair,

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
and the just lovely, wonderful, wonderful, an army of nerds,

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
I love it, like, just showering me with love,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
and all I can do is fuck it up, alright, I'm tailspinning,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I'm gonna fuck it up.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
You know what's amazing, Dan, the first time I think that you met Charlie Kaufman,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
you guys know the writer, Charlie Kaufman, and yeah,

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
and Harmon, Charlie came to like a screening of, it was a community thing,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
like it was a Christmas thing, I think, and Charlie came,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
and they met, and Dan obviously really wanted to meet Charlie,

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
and I think Charlie was like happy to meet you,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
and they had this great conversation, they talked all day,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
but you never saw less eye contact in a conversation,

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
there was just two guys in the same plaid shirt staring at their own shoes.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah, there's a mannerism.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Those are my people, that's my people,

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
we feel more than we can handle, we love each other.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Oh, but speaking of feeling things and apologizing for things,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
this was almost Kettle One, but then I remembered where we were,

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
so this is Tito's.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Tito's, fucking Tito's.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Can I make you one, you want one?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yes, please, thank you.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
One of the 85,000 great things about Texas,

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
they have a grassroots homemade vodka called Tito's,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
that is delicious, it's too delicious.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Wait, my friend Ray Pruitt, who's here tonight,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
if I'm not mistaken, Ray, you know Tito, don't you?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Haven't you met him?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Is Ray here?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
You met him, yeah.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
I met him!

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
When Tito started making Tito's vodka,

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
it was just him in a garage making this on his own, right?

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
Well, that's the story I told you.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
It's a weird, it's pitch black back there,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
and I don't know what the mics are picking up,

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
but as the story goes, Tito's vodka is made by a human being

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
and not a corporation, and now it's a corporation,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
but it's every bit as delicious as Kettle One,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
who did not sponsor our tour.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
We nearly had a bottle of Kettle One up here,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
but fuck those guys, it's Tito's all the way.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
It feels a little weird drinking out of a soda glass, but...

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
Kettle One is kind of the Nike of vodka's...

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
Kettle One, the racist vodka.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
You hear that, you fuckers?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
You fuckers had a chance.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
We were going to put a big sticker on the side of our bus

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
and make our bus like shape like a Kettle One bottle.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
We would have done anything.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Until we found out about that racial stuff.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Yeah.

06:27.000 --> 06:35.000
Kettle One, sitting on Nazi gold since 1945,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
and also making vodka, I guess that's their new racket,

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
but those in the know...

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Kettle One, baby rapers.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Kettle One, more like Kettle Two.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Meaning we pooped in it, you fuckers.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Kettle One, fuck, yeah, fuck it.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
Here's another fan of the 800 reasons to be glad we're in Texas.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Texas, I hate to play favorites.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm from California, I love California.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
California and Texas, they're not so different.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
Cows and oil and we have weed and movies.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Fake tits.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I'm not going to be a fake ambassador.

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm going to come here, I'm very proud of being a Californian.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
California and Texas, though, we could kick the whole nation's ass.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
We are the first and second in terms of gross national product

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
or whatever you call it on the state level, probably gross state product.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
It's California and then Texas.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
We're basically tied.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Each state could be a country unto itself.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
Texas's history, you know that phrase, six flags over Texas.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
You know the significance of that.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I do not.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
I do.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
I Wikipedia it.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Who's the governor?

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Michael Dean Anderson.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Really?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
MacGyver?

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Yes, the brother of MacGyver.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Just back me up, guys.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
I'll slip out the back and pretend that you're governor tonight.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
It's the MacGyver's brother.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
He's so good.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
They're such good people.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Who is the governor?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
What's his name?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Rick Perry.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Can't hear you.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Governor Bloomberg?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Rick Perry.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Oh, right, Rick Perry, the guy with the game show here.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Rick Perry.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
He sounds sexy.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I believe he's an idiot because he's a governor.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
I don't know what geniuses have ever become a politician.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
You don't wake up in bed and go, oh, my brain's so active.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I should tell people what to do.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
It doesn't make any sense.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
If you're smart, you make shit.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Or jerk off and play video games.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
Shut up, Ray.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
The Rick Flare of jerking off and playing video games just back here.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
That's what I'm talking about.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Six Flags Over Texas refers to the state's history.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
It's an amazing history.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
They've been owned by, it's a territory that's been owned by the French

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
for a brief period, the Spanish, then it was a territory of Mexico.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Then, and I don't know what other states shares this.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
I really don't.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
There might be some.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
What?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
None.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
Became their own fucking republic.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
It's a sparse applause for that.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Everyone else is like, I don't know.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
No, it's fucking cool.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Come on.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
There's nothing.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
I don't think any citizens of the state are more proud of being from a state than Texans.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I think it's more state pride here than anywhere else.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It's just a cool concept.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
I love the idea that we belong to a nation that was like, it's a federalized empire.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
At one point we had to go door to door and go, you joining us?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
You joining us?

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
And Texas was like, yeah, right.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Couple conditions, you know.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
You get a 50 year lease with an option to buy.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
And we have to be shaped like a ninja star.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
That's fucking cool, too.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
It's the only state that if you threw it, it could take your eye out.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Florida would hit you.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Even if it hit you right in the eye, it just bruised your eye.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Texas, take your fucking eye right out.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
That's just a good point.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
And there's a handle on it that you could throw it.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
You could grab it.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
It should be Oklahoma, but it's like, fuck you.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
It's like a sword handle.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah, you could cut a fucking weird cake with it and serve some shit on it.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
You could walk around and stab people with it.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Stab Mexico.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
You could be like Steve McQueen and the fucking dirty dozen and the killer guy and fucking awesome.

11:09.000 --> 11:17.000
They were their own republic and then they made a limited agreement to become part of our little club.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
And then there was an uncomfortable period called the Civil War.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
We can talk about that later if you want.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
I am not judging anyone.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
And then there's, there should be seven flags, though, shouldn't it?

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Because it's like, you got...

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
What's that?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
You asked twice, so you...

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But two different...

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Is that that makes the six?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
But why not seven?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Because of the amount of rollercoaster.

11:51.000 --> 11:58.000
Because of the amount of rollercoasters.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
In case the mics don't pick up.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I find one difference between California and Texas.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
We have very different ideas about Mexican food.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
It's very, very, very different here.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
You get a chili reino here and there's like nachos on it.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
It's very strange.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I liked the place that we ate.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Oh, no, the place was fucked.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Taco Cabana.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
You sent us a Taco Cabana.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Nobody's saying that that's authentic cuisine.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I'm not a foodie.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Are you booing me or you booing Taco Cabana?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
You're booing Taco Cabana.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Thank you.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
We walked in there.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
There were 17 people behind the counter

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
and there were 17 tables all covered in shit.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And there was a gentleman behind the counter

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
who was, well, he was 11 years old, I believe.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
And I'm like that, I said, I'll have a burrito.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And he's like...

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
A buri, what?

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
I have a bean and cheese burrito.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
And so he gave me a bean burrito with a thing,

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
with a little plastic ramekin of cheese.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
I was like, precisely...

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Plastic ramekin?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
A little plastic thing.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
A little plastic cup.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
There's a ramekin?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Is that a word?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Yeah.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
A ramekin.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
What's a ramekin?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
It's like, it's usually like a little dish.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
You put butter in or sauce or something like that.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Like a little, a little four ounce.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Yeah, you get your ranch dressing and a little ramekin.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
That's such a fucking ancient Greek name.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
I expected to snatch me up with talons and take me to Mount Olympus.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Ramekin was the son of Agamemnon,

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
who was cursed to dispense three ounces of things.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah, he stole Chipotle from the gods and gave it to a man.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
In an easy to handle serving.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
But my bean and cheese burrito, ladies and gentlemen,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
was a bean burrito that was wrapped in foil

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
that I had to take out of the foil,

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
do the tortilla, and then put cold cheese into it.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
There's no cheese in the fucking kitchen at Taco Cabana,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
and I had to make it myself, and then they give you a number,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
and I took my number to my table and was forgotten.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
They never, I had to go up and get my own food.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
I don't get it.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
The place blows.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
All right, fine.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Well, you have, you have their sympathy.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
They wanted to let you know.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Yeah.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
And I'm pretty sure that, I'm vegetarian,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I'm pretty sure those refried beans weren't,

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
and I'm gonna be shitting like a goose on the bus later on.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
For my money, I'm on this special diet.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
I had a delicious, like, it took some doing

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
to make them understand how to put it in the bowl,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
but I got a bunch of beef and chicken and a bowl

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
with some beans, and I'm about to burp it out as I said.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
But it was good.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
It was on my diet, and it was good, and we got out of there.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
But we did stop off at a friend's advice

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
to a bar called Buddy's Place, which I quite enjoyed.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Honky Tonk.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
Jeff, I want to be part of the honky tonk culture.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
I can see that.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Anybody go to this place, Buddy's?

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
Those are our two friends back there.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
The men's room is simply just a trough.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
There's no mirror.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
There's no sink.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
It's just a thing.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
It's a manger.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
You could feed an ox, or you could give birth to a Christ,

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
or you could pee on it.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
And that's all there was in the bathroom.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
I love it.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
And the bartender was like, everything was like,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
but not in a condescending way.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
It was like, and not in a colloquial way.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
All I can drink here is a Michelob ultra,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
because I'm doing the low carb thing.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
I just vodka.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
OK, I'll take Michelob ultra.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
It's like, OK, sweetie, all right, darling.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Everything was sweetie and darling in alternation.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
But it was really nice.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
I'm not saying that she's representative of the population.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I know every town you go to, everyone wants to know,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
like, oh, we're like Logan's run here.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
We're all from the future.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
I'm from Milwaukee.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
I'm embarrassed to be associated with a random thing

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
you might encounter there.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
Here's what you don't have in Los Angeles.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Bars with big, long ass shuffleboard, those things.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Shuffleboard is good.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
That shit.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
We had that.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
There are a couple in LA, but they're pretty few in far between.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Somebody followed us from LA just to call my shit out.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
There's one where?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
There's one what?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
I think you said in LA.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
No, they're all over the place.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
I'm saying they're not in LA.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
They're really buying lunch.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Yeah, there's one in Culver City, I think,

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
where that's about it.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
They're all over the place.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
I found one in Portland.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
My uncle had one in his basement.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Just that gritty sand shit you put on it.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
It's a fun game, man.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Everyone should have that.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I don't want to get off.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I don't want to do the shuffleboard show.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I don't care.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Maybe it's time that you showed them your new dance,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
the shuffleboard shuffle.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
Should we do it?

16:37.000 --> 16:47.000
We rehearsed this for weeks.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
That was great, Jeff.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
Thank you.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I say give the people what they want, Dan.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Your mama raps?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
There's going to be mama raps.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
You notice I didn't come out doing the mama thing

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
because I was like, I'm getting in a rut.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
When I learned in Phoenix, God bless them.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
They were fucking wonderful.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
All they did was support me.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
But I came out rapping about fucking your mama.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
And they were like, yeah.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
I need to form a relationship with the audience

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
everywhere I go.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
It was getting in the way.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I talk about fucking your mama.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
The biggest mistake I made, Jeff,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
was getting suggestions about fucking people's mamas.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Acting like it was some kind of weird improv game.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
What's your name?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
That was the worst thing.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
My name's Steve.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
What's your favorite food?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Ice cream sundaes.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Oh, I fucked Steve's mama.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
He was eating his favorite ice cream sundaes.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Fucking his mama.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
And she died of cancer.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Did you say she died of cancer?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Yeah, okay.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
It was terrible.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I felt awful.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I'm not an improviser.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
I'm not one of your little who's line friends.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
You know, your little, your Hoosie doodles.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
You know, it's like, yeah.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah, there's a little Greg Poopsies

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
in these Ryan Stilesies.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
And they go like, oh, I'm going to do changing emotions

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
and lift the bodies and do the arms experts.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
You used to be an improviser though.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Yeah, but I was terrible at it.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
And then I became a writer.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
And then now I've ended up doing this because I can't,

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
I get therapy doesn't work.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Is this therapy for you?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
This is absolutely therapy.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah, Andy and to Neil, these two people who live here

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
came back and interviewed Dan beforehand.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Andy really gave an awesome interview about Dan

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
and asked Dan a question.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Why are you doing this tour?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
And there's no answer for that.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
You still don't know why you're doing this.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
I still don't know why.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I just know I need this and I love this.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I have lots of stuff to talk about.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
I just checked my notepad.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
But also the thing I decided backstage,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
based on the way things have been progressing,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
like I want to bring Spencer up right away.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Not to play D&G necessarily, but...

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
For those of you who do not know, Spencer,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
we are the only comedy tour that's ever traveled

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
with our own Dungeon Master to play Dungeons & Dragons.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
If you know him, you already love him.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
If you do not know him, prepare to Spencer Crittenden.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
He's a national treasure.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
And yes, he looks exactly like you thought he would.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Thank you for coming, Spencer.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
You're welcome.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
I don't get it.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
We're getting to know him.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
We didn't really know him.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
We found out last night on stage...

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Dan and I realized last night in Phoenix

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
that we really didn't know anything about Spencer.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
We knew where he lived

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
and that he works in the back room of an Apple store.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
And now we learned that he has, on both feet,

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
a lot of the time,

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
a lot of the time,

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
he works in the back room of an Apple store,

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
and now we learned that he has, on both feet,

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
what's it called?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Syndactyly.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
He suffers from syndactylism?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I don't suffer from it.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Sorry, I'm sorry.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Forgive me.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
He's blessed with a...

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Thank you.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
He has given the rare gift of having two of his...

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
of his middle toes on each feet fused together.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Which I imagine helps you.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Yes.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Less toe jam.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Just less stinky feet.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
20% less.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Would that help you, maybe,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
in, like, if you were a swimmer, possibly?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Oh, yeah.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
I can swim circles around anybody.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
So, we vowed to learn...

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
That's not a joke.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
We wanted to learn one new thing about you every night.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
If you have anything in the chamber,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
you can pop it out now,

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
or you can just let it stew.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
I'll let it stew.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Okay, great.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
I just wanted him up there, sitting there,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
because I feel safer.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Like, if I'm at McMahon,

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
it's nice to have a Doc Severance

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
and sit in over there.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Yeah.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
I like being able to go,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
what do you think about that, Spencer?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Oh, that!

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Yeah, I'm like...

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
I'm invincible now.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Money in the bank.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Money in the bank.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Can we talk about the...

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Because we went to this wonderful,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
honky-tonky land, the shuffleboard thing,

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
like, I want to talk about the Confederate flag thing.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I mean, you don't have to act like I farted.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
This one, there was a Confederate flag

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
with a lady on it.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
What did it say?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Rebel lady.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Rebel chick?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Yeah.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Yeah.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I don't know.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
It's offensive to slaves and to women.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
I just...

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
I don't know.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I guess I remember one of these weird holdouts,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
where I'm like, I think that's fine.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
It's not like a flag that has a black person

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
with a line through it.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
It's not the same thing.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
I understand the association,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
but it's a very political thing.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
That would be a bad thing,

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
and we would all go like,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
okay, we've moved beyond that.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
But we haven't moved beyond struggle

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
and political...

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Texas of all places.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
It's like, it's the America of states.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
It was a colony,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
and it got federalized,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
and it was like, I don't know.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
When I see that flag,

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
I don't necessarily go,

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
oh, that person hates other people.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
We've all been trained to be ashamed of it,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
like it's a swastika or something.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
I don't think it's the same thing.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
I just wanted to mention it.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I don't know how you guys feel about it

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
as a progressive southerners.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
I never talked to somebody from the south.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Is this the south?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
You don't think of yourself as a southerly, do you?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
You're Texas.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Forgive me, but there's this compass.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
I back you up a hundred percent.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I don't mean to offend you.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
I just meant the south,

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
as opposed to the top half of the fucking country.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Dan, did I ever tell the story on the podcast,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
or maybe if someone listens to it,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
did I ever tell the story about me being named Jeff Davis

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
and me being in the south?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I don't know if you did.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
You don't think so?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
No.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Yeah, my name is Jeff Davis,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
and my parents were Yankees.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
They were from Nebraska and Ohio

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
when their little kids moved west during the Dust Bowl,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
and never been to the south.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
My name's Jeffrey Davis.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
It's not Jefferson Davis.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
We're not southerners.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
No one in my family's ever lived in the south.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
But I was somewhere in Louisiana once,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and I went to a liquor store in the morning.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
I was walking from a girl's place to my hotel,

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
and it was a huge, long walk.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Yeah.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
And it was a really long walk,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
but it was in a very black neighborhood,

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
and I was this only white guy walking,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
like little girls and boys are going to school.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Wait, man, walking?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Yeah.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
But I really looked like a gay vampire.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
I was just super tall and skinny in a black suit.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
I'm super pale and hungover,

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
and I'm coming down the road,

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
and little kids are crossing the street to go around me.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
And I clearly was not up to any good there.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
And I go into a liquor store,

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
and my cell phone was dead,

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
and I wanted to make a call at a pay phone or something like that,

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
and I went into this liquor store,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
and it was this kind of redneck-y guy,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
you know, like Cajun Dude behind the counter.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
And I said,

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
do you have a phone?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
He's like,

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
I got a pay phone,

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
and I said,

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
well, can you break some money for the change?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
He said,

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
you got to buy something.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
So I go,

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
okay, fine.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
So I got some trail mix and a Gatorade,

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
and I'm like,

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I'll get a six pack of beer, too,

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
so back at the hotel.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
So I get the beer,

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
and he goes,

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
ID.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
And so I go,

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
God, Jesus Christ.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
And he gives me that,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
so I get the change of the thing.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
I give him my ID and the money

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
for the Gatorade and the beer and the trail mix.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
And he looks at the ID

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
and puts it back on the counter

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
and pushes the money,

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
the ID,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
and all the goods back toward me.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
And he's like,

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
thank you.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
I'm like,

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
can I have it?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
And he's like,

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
I said,

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
thank you.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I'm like,

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
I said,

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
yeah,

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
I asked,

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
can I have it?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
I don't know what's going on.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
He goes,

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
he goes,

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
good day.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
I'm like,

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
do I get to,

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
what's going on?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
And he goes,

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
he goes,

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
it's yours,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
you go to take it.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
I'm like,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
here's the money.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
And he goes,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I can't charge you,

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Jeff Davis.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
And I went,

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
oh yeah,

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
okay,

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
well,

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
I'm not even from the south,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
man.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
I'm Jeffrey Davis,

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
my parents,

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
even,

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
he was even so.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
I go,

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
my parents didn't live in,

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
even so.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
My parents didn't live in the south.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Even so,

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
I went,

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
oh,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
racist.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
And he goes,

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
even so.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
For real.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
For no fucking joke.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
But he leaned in

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
and got low

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
and fucking had a microphone.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Even so.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
And the stuff,

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
I'm like,

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
well,

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
I'm happy to profit off of your racism.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
And I,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
I took the shit

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
and I walk out in the cab,

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
I called the cab,

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
and the cab comes,

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
and there's a cab driver

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
and he's a Cajun fellow too.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
And,

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
and I get in the cab

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
and he turns the meter on

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
and I'm like,

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
man,

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
that was weird.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
That was in this liquor store.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
And I bought the beer

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
and he saw my ID

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
and it said,

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Jeff Davis.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
And the guy turns the meter off.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
So,

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
you're,

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
you're,

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
you're,

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
you're,

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
you're,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
you're,

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
you're taking to a magical land with you.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
So tomorrow we're driving to Louisiana.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
And I'll tell you when I get out of the car,

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
I'm like,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
well, if my name isn't Jeff Davis,

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
because shit's free.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Everything's just Jeff Davis

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
elementary school,

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Boulevard,

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
bank.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
It's Jeff Davis everywhere.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
I just,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I always get conflicted about like stuff like that.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Like I,

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
I,

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I hate me some government.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Like,

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
like,

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
like,

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
like,

26:37.000 --> 26:43.560
So, if there's a flag that represents the idea that once upon a time, people didn't

26:43.560 --> 26:47.760
tell people what to do quite as much, it's like, are you going to erase it from history

26:47.760 --> 26:50.360
and you're going to politicize it and overcharge it?

26:50.360 --> 26:55.320
That's why I'm always like, it's not my right to intrude upon that, but I feel like I, growing

26:55.320 --> 27:01.400
up in Wisconsin, I'm part of some weird federal machine that, I have no idea how people feel,

27:01.400 --> 27:03.720
how they really feel, what offends people.

27:03.720 --> 27:10.560
And I used to feel that way about guns too, like that shit went crazy recently, but I

27:10.560 --> 27:15.880
always felt like, I couldn't be more liberal, I'm left of liberal, I'm so left of liberal

27:15.880 --> 27:24.000
that I seem right-winged at my liberal friends, because I'm so left that I just want to burn

27:24.000 --> 27:29.680
down the White House and like, build a statue of myself pissing on-

27:29.680 --> 27:36.680
Good night everybody, thanks for coming.

27:36.680 --> 27:42.560
Yo, yo, yo, burn down the White House, it's too white, let's get some torches, burn it

27:42.560 --> 27:48.280
down tonight, we're gonna march up the avenue, that's what it's for, knock on that motherfucking

27:48.280 --> 27:58.800
president's door and say, whose house is this, motherfucker, yeah, who it, I don't know.

27:58.800 --> 28:06.080
That was the Anarchist Rap, yeah, I'm sure Mikhail Bakunin would have signed off on that

28:06.080 --> 28:07.080
one.

28:07.080 --> 28:11.720
But I, like, the gun thing is like, I don't know, it's like, like, it is-

28:11.720 --> 28:15.320
Did you just fuck the White House's front door, what was that about?

28:15.320 --> 28:28.720
For those in podcast land, I humped, I mimed humping the White House's front door, sensually.

28:28.720 --> 28:34.960
I know, that whole right to bear arms thing, it seduces me, and this is the worst time

28:34.960 --> 28:40.160
of all to ever say that, that fucking guy, like, you know, the thing happened and the

28:40.160 --> 28:46.640
guy said the stuff and like, it's too politically charged, but I can't get past that concept

28:46.640 --> 28:50.800
of like, well, I don't know, there's weird shit about me that makes me go, yeah, but

28:50.800 --> 28:55.920
I don't know, who wants to be part of a machine, it's fucking dumb, like, I thought the whole

28:55.920 --> 28:59.960
point of this country, I thought the thing that made us sexy was that we didn't want

28:59.960 --> 29:04.160
to be part of a machine, I thought the reason we called it the United States is because

29:04.160 --> 29:09.960
it was like, you know, I don't know, it's too politically charged, though, they shove

29:09.960 --> 29:15.440
the shit down our throats where it's like, the idea of dichotomy, the idea of a bipartisan

29:15.440 --> 29:19.800
system, the idea that you're either with one side or the other, that's the greatest trick

29:19.800 --> 29:23.600
that devil ever played, like, the idea that you're not allowed to be a single human being

29:23.600 --> 29:28.160
and go like, yeah, but I want this and I want that, like, and then you just have people

29:28.160 --> 29:31.840
from both sides telling you, yeah, but whose side are you on, like, because one of them

29:31.840 --> 29:39.480
is like a Hitler, and it's just not true, but it's like, yeah, I don't know, it makes

29:39.480 --> 29:46.880
me nervous, you know, you can hear the people eating their hot wings, like, I could say

29:46.880 --> 29:49.880
anything, I could just, you know, like, fuse and blow something up.

29:49.880 --> 29:53.560
But I know you don't like political conversations, but I have a question for you. How do you

29:53.560 --> 29:55.560
feel about Obama's mother?

29:55.560 --> 29:57.560
All right, well.

29:57.560 --> 30:09.560
I fucked Obama's mama in the city. I fucked Obama's mama with brother titties. I went

30:09.560 --> 30:16.560
to Obama, said, can I fuck your mama? He said, my name's Obama, he rhymes with mama, so I

30:16.560 --> 30:22.560
go to Lama. I fucked Obama. I don't know, yeah, that's how I feel.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.560
So you'd fuck her, too.

30:24.560 --> 30:25.560
Yeah, I'd fuck her, too.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.560
Oh, yeah, I'd hit that.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.560
Are any mamas, are any mamas safe?

30:30.560 --> 30:37.560
No, no, not for me, and I'm blessed to live in a country where it's okay to say that.

30:37.560 --> 30:42.560
Anyone whose mama I want to fuck, I could say, I want to fuck your mama. President Obama,

30:42.560 --> 30:49.560
are you listening? I would like to fuck your mama. And the reason I voted for him is because

30:49.560 --> 30:55.560
I think he would go, all right, well, I guess that's what he wants to do.

30:55.560 --> 31:00.560
As opposed to somebody who would go like, what did you say? I'm gonna fucking arrest you and put you

31:00.560 --> 31:01.560
in Guantanamo.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.560
Obama would say, I hope you fuck my mama.

31:03.560 --> 31:08.560
Maybe, I don't know. Stimulate the package of the thing or whatever.

31:08.560 --> 31:13.560
I hope you change my mama's pussy.

31:13.560 --> 31:16.560
We're supposed to be the government, we're supposed to be...

31:16.560 --> 31:19.560
You wouldn't fuck Spencer's mama, would you? You met her the other day, she was a very lovely woman.

31:19.560 --> 31:25.560
I would, you know, I'd take a crack.

31:25.560 --> 31:30.560
Yo, Spencer, I saw your mama yesterday.

31:30.560 --> 31:34.560
It was two days ago.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.560
You see, you can't do it.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.560
Yeah, you can't do it.

31:39.560 --> 31:43.560
That's the important thing, humanity.

31:43.560 --> 31:48.560
I think I'd fuck Obama's mama, but if he was here, I'd probably just shake his hand and say,

31:48.560 --> 31:51.560
thank you for running the country.

31:51.560 --> 31:56.560
And I think he would thank me for doing a good show.

31:56.560 --> 31:59.560
So you're just cowing to his power, to his status?

31:59.560 --> 32:04.560
I don't know, I think then he'd go away and he'd say to somebody, I'd fuck that dude's mama.

32:04.560 --> 32:08.560
Yeah, but you fuck members of our audience, mama's all the time.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.560
Are you saying that they're lesser than Obama, that their mamas are more vulnerable?

32:11.560 --> 32:18.560
When I rap about fucking your mama, I'm using the royal your mama.

32:18.560 --> 32:25.560
I don't mean... I know that many of your mamas are dead, or dying.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.560
Yeah, you can hear them...

32:28.560 --> 32:33.560
My mother died when I was 13, you want to fuck her?

32:33.560 --> 32:36.560
I don't want to get specific.

32:36.560 --> 32:41.560
It's like the art form of wanting to fuck your mama.

32:41.560 --> 32:49.560
Your mama's bigger than any individual.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.560
What?

32:51.560 --> 32:53.560
Yes, I'm saying yes.

32:53.560 --> 32:56.560
She's literally bigger than any individual.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.560
Yes.

32:57.560 --> 33:02.560
When your mama represents the collective, she represents the whole collective.

33:02.560 --> 33:12.560
I don't want to say your mama is fat and important to me, but she's bigger than any individual.

33:12.560 --> 33:20.560
When your mama occupies my thoughts, she occupies my thoughts.

33:20.560 --> 33:29.560
There are agrarian societies that would consider her in charge of the cycles of the moon.

33:29.560 --> 33:33.560
People would be honored to nail her.

33:33.560 --> 33:38.560
I think it was nice that Eric Eitel came on our goodbye show in Los Angeles and sang about fucking your mama.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.560
Did you guys hear that? That was amazing.

33:41.560 --> 33:47.560
We wrote a Money Python member, Eric, our buddy. We wrote him a song that was like, he's never going to sing it.

33:47.560 --> 33:52.560
It was just about a fucking dad, a dance dad, and nuzzle in his nuts.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.560
Dan and I were just in heaven. It was the greatest.

33:55.560 --> 33:59.560
We wrote a song for a Money Python guy. We wrote that song.

33:59.560 --> 34:03.560
I was like, fuck your mama, nuzzle in his nuts, and then the guy from Money Python sang it.

34:03.560 --> 34:05.560
It was a humble brag.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.560
Let me check my notepad.

34:11.560 --> 34:19.560
There was a couple of Texas things while we were here that we can't talk about anywhere else.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.560
Do you think our angry bus driver is here in the audience?

34:22.560 --> 34:24.560
I don't know. Morgan is our driver here?

34:24.560 --> 34:27.560
Nope. Fire away, fire away.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.560
This guy is complicated.

34:30.560 --> 34:34.560
He has a sense of humor. I just don't know what it is yet.

34:34.560 --> 34:46.560
I detect, here's my, I feel like at one point he was driving like Gallagher or Louis Anderson in a bus,

34:46.560 --> 34:49.560
and then he was like, he's full of joy in life.

34:49.560 --> 34:54.560
And it was like, hey, you like smashing watermelons, maybe you should smash an orange.

34:54.560 --> 34:59.560
And Gallagher was like, keep driving, you fucking lackey piece of shit.

34:59.560 --> 35:05.560
And he looked forward, and then X-ray of his heart went click.

35:05.560 --> 35:08.560
And then he became his current personality.

35:08.560 --> 35:14.560
Well, I don't know. Apparently on that bus, he's driven Slayer and Sticks quite a bit, which I think is pretty cool.

35:14.560 --> 35:19.560
And I think he, yeah. And he had very nice things to say about both bands.

35:19.560 --> 35:27.560
He has this gruff, he does things like, we're all hanging out in the bus, and then it's driving,

35:27.560 --> 35:32.560
and then he appears from one of the bunks and then comes up to the front and goes up to the front.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.560
For a while we had another driver because it was too long of a drive.

35:35.560 --> 35:41.560
And then he goes like, hey guys, little bit of a tour bus etiquette 101.

35:41.560 --> 35:47.560
If you're hanging out and someone's sleeping in the back, close the door between the things.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.560
Close the door.

35:49.560 --> 35:56.560
And then the director of the movie said, hey, a little bit of humanity 101.

35:56.560 --> 35:59.560
If you hate your job, stop doing it.

35:59.560 --> 36:04.560
Which was such a...

36:04.560 --> 36:09.560
See, I feel weird talking about this because this guy is going to be behind the wheel

36:09.560 --> 36:14.560
for an entire tour around the country, including the Northeast during January.

36:14.560 --> 36:18.560
Yeah, and if he decides, he's going to go, you know what? Fuck it.

36:18.560 --> 36:23.560
He's going to go Christopher Walken from Annie Hall on this.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.560
But, you know, I don't know.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.560
Well, what do you want me to do?

36:27.560 --> 36:32.560
I have to say, that aside, he keeps it between the lines and he hasn't scared me yet.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.560
There's some scary drivers out there.

36:34.560 --> 36:38.560
I've gone to sleep in that bunk and I've never felt like the telltale signs of a bad driver.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.560
Yeah, all right. Well, a new update in the next city.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.560
We're forming relationships that we never knew.

36:44.560 --> 36:50.560
He looks exactly like Jeff Daniels and he's objectively ashamed of it.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.560
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

36:53.560 --> 36:56.560
I know. That's what I told him.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.560
Some Jeff Daniels hater over there.

36:59.560 --> 37:03.560
Or maybe a guy who looks just like Jeff Daniels and he's like...

37:03.560 --> 37:05.560
With a pinch of Coulier.

37:05.560 --> 37:10.560
A little full house, Dave Coulier.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.560
I'm only putting this on record.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.560
Come on, Jason, get up here.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.560
No, I'm kidding. He's not here.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.560
Oh, God damn it.

37:19.560 --> 37:23.560
Jeff, why don't you like the song Hey Ya by Outcast?

37:23.560 --> 37:30.560
When everyone else in the world loves it.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.560
Ambushed.

37:32.560 --> 37:33.560
Ambushed.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.560
I don't like it. It's a bad song.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.560
No, you know, it's not a bad song.

37:37.560 --> 37:39.560
There's a very good reason why I hate it.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.560
I don't like popular things to begin with.

37:41.560 --> 37:46.560
I kind of have a very uncharming, unnecessary aversion to popular things.

37:46.560 --> 37:51.560
I must say it's a bad song.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.560
I think it does exactly what it ought to do.

37:53.560 --> 37:55.560
It's a pop song. It's a popular song. It should be.

37:55.560 --> 37:58.560
But we used to go to this one little bar or restaurant in my neighborhood in Los Feliz.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.560
Shut the fuck up.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.560
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.560
I'm a little on edge.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.560
Hey ya. Hey ya.

38:05.560 --> 38:06.560
I guess it got it.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.560
Oh, I think you pooped it.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.560
I pooped my trousers.

38:09.560 --> 38:10.560
No, I think I pooped it.

38:10.560 --> 38:11.560
I pooped.

38:11.560 --> 38:12.560
Okay, you don't know.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.560
It's a fuck. It's not a good song.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.560
It's a shitty song.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.560
Here's my problem with that song.

38:16.560 --> 38:20.560
You couldn't go anywhere for 17 months without hearing that thing 15 times a day.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.560
I don't like over.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.560
Also, I would never walk on a plane and be carrying the DaVinci code.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.560
I would blow my brains out.

38:27.560 --> 38:30.560
I don't want to have a book and see 15 other people reading the same book.

38:30.560 --> 38:31.560
Does that make me cool?

38:31.560 --> 38:32.560
No.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.560
I just don't want to.

38:33.560 --> 38:36.560
I'm never going to read The Celestial Prophecy or any of that shit.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.560
I'm sure they're great books, but I just don't want to.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.560
It's not a sexy thing.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.560
I'm not boasting.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.560
I shouldn't be like this.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.560
All right.

38:44.560 --> 38:45.560
I just wanted to jump.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.560
I made a list of stuff to talk about.

38:47.560 --> 38:49.560
I think it was overplayed for me.

38:49.560 --> 38:50.560
I didn't need that much of it.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.560
I think it's a real toe tapper.

38:52.560 --> 38:53.560
No, you don't.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.560
You suck an ass.

38:55.560 --> 38:56.560
No, I'm not sucking ass.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.560
Did I ask them first if they like outcast?

38:58.560 --> 39:00.560
No, you go to them.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.560
You massage them.

39:02.560 --> 39:06.560
Did we drive past a sign that said Austin Gateway to Outcast Lovers?

39:06.560 --> 39:09.560
I don't know how they feel.

39:09.560 --> 39:13.560
I know how the world feels because it's the fucking number one song forever.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.560
Everyone loves it.

39:14.560 --> 39:17.560
And a lot of their stuff, and they're always having a great time.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.560
You always hear them having a great time in their music.

39:19.560 --> 39:20.560
They fucking love outcasts.

39:20.560 --> 39:24.560
I will take the outcast Hayah song any day of the week

39:24.560 --> 39:27.560
over anything that Gwen Stefani or No Doubt sings though.

39:27.560 --> 39:28.560
That's it.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.560
Too particular.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.560
This guy's too particular.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.560
Anyways, moving on.

39:34.560 --> 39:35.560
Next topic.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.560
Why am I under fire?

39:37.560 --> 39:38.560
No, no, no.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.560
I wrote down a list because I was a little nervous.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.560
I wanted to be able to talk to them about stuff.

39:42.560 --> 39:49.560
That was like, hey, I was like, I wanted to confront you about Hayah in front of people.

39:49.560 --> 39:53.560
There's certain popular bands that people love that I hate.

39:53.560 --> 39:57.560
And I am convinced that if you give me five minutes,

39:57.560 --> 40:04.560
I can turn the most die-hard Rush fan and convince them that they actually don't like Rush.

40:04.560 --> 40:05.560
Yeah.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.560
Alright, who's the biggest Rush fan in the audience?

40:07.560 --> 40:08.560
No, no, no, no, no, no.

40:08.560 --> 40:11.560
You don't want the biggest Rush fan in the audience to come up here?

40:11.560 --> 40:12.560
Is there anybody?

40:12.560 --> 40:14.560
No, because now it's been front-loaded.

40:14.560 --> 40:15.560
Okay.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.560
Yeah, nobody.

40:16.560 --> 40:17.560
See how respectful they are?

40:17.560 --> 40:18.560
Also, you know what?

40:18.560 --> 40:19.560
You know what?

40:19.560 --> 40:22.560
I don't like Led Zeppelin.

40:22.560 --> 40:25.560
No, I hear more applause than booze.

40:25.560 --> 40:26.560
No.

40:26.560 --> 40:29.560
I think it's a great band.

40:29.560 --> 40:33.560
I love the band, but Robert Plant is a screechy ass.

40:33.560 --> 40:36.560
And when you see film, when you see film of him playing,

40:36.560 --> 40:38.560
and he's swinging his microphone around,

40:38.560 --> 40:40.560
and he's stuffing his pants with a sock,

40:40.560 --> 40:42.560
or maybe he's just got a giant cock.

40:42.560 --> 40:44.560
If you have a giant cock and you're wearing those pants,

40:44.560 --> 40:46.560
then stop being so insecure and go,

40:46.560 --> 40:52.560
and looking over at Jimmy Page, he's doing nothing but standing there playing guitar and minding his business.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.560
And every time you see Robert Plant, look over him.

40:54.560 --> 40:55.560
You can tell he hates him.

40:55.560 --> 40:57.560
He's jealous of the fact that he can do that.

40:57.560 --> 40:59.560
You're, because I was confused by your reaction,

40:59.560 --> 41:03.560
you are your hardcore Zeppelin to the point where you can be anti-Robert Plant, right?

41:03.560 --> 41:04.560
Yeah.

41:04.560 --> 41:05.560
Yeah, okay, all right.

41:05.560 --> 41:06.560
The band is great.

41:06.560 --> 41:08.560
It's the best band with the worst singer, I think.

41:08.560 --> 41:09.560
Not the worst singer.

41:09.560 --> 41:10.560
They can do that.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.560
All right.

41:11.560 --> 41:12.560
This is great.

41:12.560 --> 41:13.560
Austin, bring them people together.

41:13.560 --> 41:14.560
Fine.

41:14.560 --> 41:19.560
He was the hardest booer of it, then.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.560
I'm going to pour this guy a tea, though.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.560
Can we get a glass up front for this guy?

41:25.560 --> 41:26.560
All right.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.560
Moving on.

41:27.560 --> 41:28.560
Next item on my jacket.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.560
Yeah, you thought I was going to die.

41:30.560 --> 41:31.560
I made friends.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.560
No, no, no, no.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.560
Fucking this guy and our lifelong buddies now.

41:34.560 --> 41:37.560
I wasn't setting you up to be, to suffer anything.

41:37.560 --> 41:38.560
All right.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.560
I wanted to have a relationship with these guys.

41:41.560 --> 41:42.560
On the test long control.

41:42.560 --> 41:45.560
I was only moving forward in doing that.

41:45.560 --> 41:48.560
Jeff and I have been friends for probably,

41:48.560 --> 41:52.560
I will just round up 15 years today, this morning,

41:52.560 --> 41:55.560
because we've never been on tour ever.

41:55.560 --> 41:58.560
We had a special milestone.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.560
It's never come up.

41:59.560 --> 42:00.560
Why would it ever happen?

42:00.560 --> 42:05.560
In an IHOP bathroom, Jeff and I took our first shit together.

42:05.560 --> 42:06.560
Not together.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.560
We went to each other.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.560
Different toilets.

42:09.560 --> 42:10.560
I've known them forever.

42:10.560 --> 42:12.560
I came in the bathroom.

42:12.560 --> 42:13.560
I know he's in there.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.560
I'm not going to ignore it.

42:15.560 --> 42:17.560
You came in and sang a little song.

42:17.560 --> 42:20.560
Booping in an IHOP bathroom.

42:20.560 --> 42:23.560
It's going to make your dreams come true.

42:23.560 --> 42:25.560
Yeah, something like that.

42:25.560 --> 42:31.560
It's probably hard to see, but these are Dan's feet under the toilet.

42:31.560 --> 42:35.560
Yeah, it's probably hard to see for some of you.

42:35.560 --> 42:37.560
Have you seen that enough?

42:37.560 --> 42:40.560
I know you hate being told your shoes untied, bro.

42:40.560 --> 42:43.560
I'm not saying that, but your jeans hang down low.

42:43.560 --> 42:45.560
When your jeans are long, you wear them long enough

42:45.560 --> 42:48.560
to be the little seam, the bead at the end kind of rips off.

42:48.560 --> 42:51.560
Mostly that's just a piss mop that you've got.

42:51.560 --> 42:54.560
It's just hanging out right in the kill zone

42:54.560 --> 42:56.560
underneath the toilet at an IHOP.

42:56.560 --> 42:59.560
I guess I just love Texas.

42:59.560 --> 43:03.560
I trust their germs to be as big as everything else

43:03.560 --> 43:05.560
and not be able to get into my bloodstream.

43:05.560 --> 43:07.560
What was it called? Fort Stockton?

43:07.560 --> 43:09.560
Fort Stockton, I believe we were in.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.560
Fort Stockton IHOP?

43:11.560 --> 43:14.560
Spencer, Spencer, keep it down.

43:14.560 --> 43:16.560
Sorry, guys.

43:16.560 --> 43:20.560
I heard his little plop plops.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.560
That's all I wanted to say.

43:22.560 --> 43:25.560
I take adorable shits.

43:25.560 --> 43:30.560
They're like unicorn tears.

43:30.560 --> 43:33.560
It's amazing.

43:33.560 --> 43:35.560
We're on the road.

43:35.560 --> 43:39.560
It's our second show in and shits going down.

43:39.560 --> 43:43.560
Not really, yeah.

43:43.560 --> 43:48.560
I've lost track of time because we love these people so much.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.560
That's 11.23. What does that mean?

43:50.560 --> 43:53.560
When did we go on? We went about 10.40?

43:53.560 --> 43:55.560
I don't know.

43:55.560 --> 43:59.560
I feel like we need that audience participation level

43:59.560 --> 44:01.560
of our show.

44:01.560 --> 44:03.560
I don't want to force it.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.560
Who's allergic to vanilla? I am.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.560
Let's do a rap about that.

44:07.560 --> 44:09.560
I learned my lesson.

44:09.560 --> 44:12.560
I just want to feel like...

44:12.560 --> 44:16.560
Last night we came up with a little anthem

44:16.560 --> 44:19.560
that we're trying to write lyrics to.

44:19.560 --> 44:22.560
We brought a woman up on stage

44:22.560 --> 44:25.560
and she was the dido to Dan's Eminem

44:25.560 --> 44:28.560
and she did the sing-along hook to it.

44:28.560 --> 44:31.560
Is there any... I would limit it to young ladies

44:31.560 --> 44:33.560
unless they don't step forward.

44:33.560 --> 44:35.560
Is that sexist to limit it to the ladies?

44:35.560 --> 44:37.560
It could be a guy.

44:37.560 --> 44:39.560
It's a very masculine stage right now.

44:39.560 --> 44:41.560
If there's a woman...

44:41.560 --> 44:44.560
Does anybody feel like they can carry enough of a tune

44:44.560 --> 44:46.560
to do the Rihanna hook?

44:46.560 --> 44:48.560
That hand went up pretty emphatically.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.560
That's the one I saw.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.560
What is that?

44:52.560 --> 44:54.560
Come on up if you like.

44:54.560 --> 44:56.560
Let's welcome her to the stage.

44:56.560 --> 44:59.560
APPLAUSE

45:01.560 --> 45:03.560
What's your name, young lady?

45:03.560 --> 45:05.560
Jen Brown.

45:05.560 --> 45:07.560
Jen Brown.

45:07.560 --> 45:09.560
Jen Brown.

45:09.560 --> 45:11.560
Her name rhymes with Harmontown.

45:11.560 --> 45:14.560
Did you listen to the last podcast when we were in Phoenix?

45:14.560 --> 45:16.560
I missed the last one.

45:16.560 --> 45:18.560
We came up with this refrain.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.560
It was released a couple of hours ago.

45:20.560 --> 45:22.560
Do you want a seat?

45:22.560 --> 45:24.560
Are you comfortable standing?

45:24.560 --> 45:26.560
Jen, are you a singer?

45:26.560 --> 45:28.560
I'm not primarily, but I...

45:28.560 --> 45:30.560
Use the microphone, Jen. You're a singer.

45:30.560 --> 45:32.560
I'm not primarily, but...

45:32.560 --> 45:34.560
Is that mic on?

45:34.560 --> 45:36.560
Yes.

45:36.560 --> 45:38.560
Is that the Zeppelin guy?

45:38.560 --> 45:40.560
This guy's mercurial as shit.

45:40.560 --> 45:42.560
Zeppelin guy may not have to come up here.

45:42.560 --> 45:44.560
Raise his edge with this guy.

45:44.560 --> 45:48.560
The refrain that we landed on in Phoenix was...

45:48.560 --> 45:50.560
You want to sing it for her?

45:50.560 --> 45:52.560
Yeah.

45:52.560 --> 45:54.560
This is the one song that we played in Phoenix.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.560
I'll run it through her.

45:56.560 --> 45:58.560

53:02.720 --> 53:07.800
She she would definitely in a issue would be booked. I think in a movie. She would be cast as a manic pixie girl

I've never actually looked at my character sheet and I got a tutorial from Spencer and he explained all of this all the information

54:39.760 --> 54:41.760
And I'm very excited about yeah

54:42.040 --> 54:43.720
Take it away spent

54:43.720 --> 54:49.840
When we last met our heroes had just been looking skyward at Admiral Darkstars black armada

54:49.840 --> 54:56.400
Pouring through the rift the ships launched out legions of black metallic cylinder cylinders before sailing westward

54:57.040 --> 55:02.560
Realizing his camp may be in danger mango and his barbarians teleported swiftly away to warn the others

55:02.920 --> 55:09.760
Left in the middle of a few of the mysterious cylinders the party inspected them for a bit before they began making strange noise and

55:10.160 --> 55:11.760
hovering with menace

55:11.760 --> 55:17.240
Not sure how to proceed the heroes cast shot through and urinated their way to victory as

55:17.240 --> 55:22.600
They stood among the battered constructs. They hoped that butts camp would be safe

55:25.800 --> 55:32.080
By the way somebody tweeted like I don't understand what you guys get in these fights like what are the stakes?

55:33.360 --> 55:36.600
How do I know like if you get six damage? What does that mean?

55:36.600 --> 55:40.340
I and that I was like yeah, you're at good point. You should know I have

55:40.340 --> 55:47.060
24 hit points. I have 40 hit points, but right now you have like 30 lefts than that Jeff

55:47.060 --> 55:49.900
And you have 10 lefts because you just got out of a fight last time

55:49.900 --> 55:53.460
Well, why didn't you write it down on my character sheet Spencer because that's your job?

55:53.460 --> 56:10.940
Hey, yeah, wait after after every show you come up and take my character sheet away from me and put it in a little

56:10.940 --> 56:15.660
Trapper Keeper, and I never get to see it again. That's true. We don't we don't have pencils and erasers

56:15.660 --> 56:20.420
You needed that's not my fault. All right, we need we need to get him a special. This is day two

56:20.420 --> 56:25.940
Why are we fighting it? We have a whole tour calm down everybody. All right, so I don't have 40. I have what?

56:26.460 --> 56:28.460
Ten right now you're at

56:28.900 --> 56:34.420
11 so how do you get your hit points back is rest and well last time we met you actually put on a healing

56:34.660 --> 56:39.100
Pendant in anticipation of healing my healing pendant was bootin up. You said it's starting to yeah

56:39.100 --> 56:42.180
You can feel the rejuvenating forces flowing through you

56:43.580 --> 56:46.500
Your hit points trick trickle upwards to

56:46.500 --> 56:49.860
To what to how many you don't know?

56:50.900 --> 56:53.380
I'll tell you in the future. I'm still going all right

56:54.020 --> 56:58.780
Looking around you you realize that you're actually in the remains of some long destroyed village

56:59.100 --> 57:03.780
Only the foundations and the charge skeletal wooden frames of several buildings remain

57:04.060 --> 57:08.420
You can tell that some time has passed between the raising of this town and now

57:08.740 --> 57:15.420
Because several green grass shoots and delicate tendrils of stems have begun overtaking the ashy black structures

57:15.420 --> 57:18.380
You wonder what brought this devastation and why?

57:19.540 --> 57:23.300
Mulraine seems tense worried and has a far away look in his eyes

57:25.180 --> 57:28.500
She's a he yeah, I keep forgetting. Yeah, she's a dude

57:30.180 --> 57:35.980
What's what's wrong Mulraine you seem tense with a far away look in your eyes

57:37.660 --> 57:39.660
Hi gentlemen comrades. I

57:40.580 --> 57:42.380
I'm going to

57:42.380 --> 57:44.380
fashion some more arrows

57:44.380 --> 57:49.060
On the other side of the village. I know that you'll remain here. I'll be back in

57:49.780 --> 57:52.420
10 shakes of a swallow's birthing

57:55.140 --> 58:00.580
That seems weird he departs quickly she seems evasive he yeah

58:03.300 --> 58:05.300
Guys I get it. I look like a girl

58:06.580 --> 58:09.220
I by the way merch is available after the show

58:09.220 --> 58:14.780
T-shirts everything will sign it. Well, I'll sign everything

58:18.220 --> 58:20.220
That was the sound of moraine leaving

58:21.180 --> 58:23.180
The two of you remain I

58:24.100 --> 58:33.180
Detect magic around here. You detect the faint straight traces of dangerous evocation magic the most deadly and destructive force

58:33.180 --> 58:36.180
Oh

58:36.300 --> 58:40.460
So this is there's dangerous magic is lurking around the skeletal tendrils

58:40.460 --> 58:44.420
I'd say there's the echoes of maybe the remains of past cast magic

58:45.940 --> 58:49.900
All right. Well, we should head to my dad's camp. Yeah, cuz he

58:50.980 --> 58:54.140
He's going there to make sure of his camp is safe. We should come to his rescue

58:54.140 --> 58:59.940
I know you and your dad have a troubled past. Yeah, yeah, but I'm a barbarian. He's a barbarian your part barbarian more or less

58:59.940 --> 59:05.460
Aren't you I mean there's sort of genetically kind of right? Yeah, yeah, what which which way do they go?

59:05.980 --> 59:10.740
You don't know they teleported. Oh, right, but we were there. Mm-hmm, right?

59:10.740 --> 59:12.740
Okay, so we also probably don't want to leave me

59:13.220 --> 59:16.580
No, we'll get you. What are you doing? She's carving arrows

59:19.060 --> 59:21.060
I don't do stuff now

59:23.060 --> 59:27.060
We tweet we take off back to the to the Buttsalot encampment

59:27.060 --> 59:32.380
All right, you two set off but not before sharpie trips over his own two feet and falls flat on his face as

59:33.220 --> 59:39.460
You pick yourself up. You realize you didn't trip over your own two feet, but instead a large tattered tome a

59:40.340 --> 59:44.140
Tome a tattered tome. That's a book. Yeah, I know it's a book

59:45.140 --> 59:47.060
I'm helping everyone out. I'm just

59:48.060 --> 59:53.820
What do you think I was doing in 89 getting laid? I know what a tome is

59:53.820 --> 01:00:02.740
Pick it up. I pick it up. You pick it up. I look at it. You look at it. It says journal

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:08.620
The edges are burnt and blackened the cover is worn

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:13.220
I found it. It seems strange that it survived this met this intense fire

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.940
Hmm. Is it magical?

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:23.100
You've detected magic and you didn't detect magic coming from it, but I open it. That's not very polite. Somebody's journal, man

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:32.420
The first entry reads dead all dead my children gone

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.380
Five bright souls snuffed out in an instant

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:40.020
No mother should be forced to endure such horror let alone be forced to watch

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:46.420
There screams their heart-shattering screams the crackling flames the smell of burning flesh

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:50.220
I died five times that night and yet I'm still here

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:55.980
Even this place is gone. We had a 16 hour bus ride from Phoenix you guys

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.700
That's awesome. I

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:03.580
Can't the journal entry ends there Spencer everybody. That's

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.420
Holy shit

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.420
Do I leave?

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:16.140
Was it signed? No, no, you're staying. It was it signed. Is there a name? There is no name. Hmm

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:24.220
Well, I think we should keep this and restore it to it's a huge clue in the mystery of whether or not a bunch of people died here

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:31.900
The book is all the case it may have multiple pages. Oh, oh, I turned the page Jesus

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:38.900
If only I were stronger if only I were male

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.780
If only we're a male the entry ends. It's a woman

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.180
Okay, I turn every page

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.620
You read the whole thing strong move I

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:58.460
Found a way to carry on I couldn't protect them because I was weak

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:05.740
I am weak curse this female form curse my cowardice my inaccuracy, but that's over all of it

01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:12.220
I found an artifact. They say it's curse, but I don't know why who wouldn't want this power the entry ends

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:17.540
I'm assuming you're flipping through. Yeah. Yeah, the next entry the last entry

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.980
It worked. I can feel my old self drifting away

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:29.380
My memories seem fainter weaker the belt were just fine. Now. No one can trace me back to my roots my past

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:35.340
I thought I should change my name to something more masculine to honor their spirits. I came up with Mulraine

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:43.220
Well from the elvish word for one who survived great calamity rain

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.300
God's mercy for the rain that should have come to save my children

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.220
My dear children

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.220
That noise again

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:55.940
Yeah, the coming back noise

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:03.980
Hello gentlemen, you're reading. Oh, yeah, yeah, we found your book

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:17.380
That survived the fire somehow that was for no one's eyes, but the forests

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:29.900
Were you wait were you a dude or were you always always been a woman but took on a male name because she cursed her

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:36.060
Femininity because it didn't save her I had a belt that turned me into a man. I am currently a man

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:41.420
I was a woman who watched my children die in a fire. So a belt made you a dude

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.700
It's like a strap on you're gonna question

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.060
You bought a pig and

01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:58.580
Yes, I did proudly

01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:01.340
Uh, no, it was not a strap on

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:07.100
It was a and I don't know what that is. It was it was a man strap on as a belt that has a dick on it

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.340
Makes makes women feel like dudes I

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:21.220
Think that's cool if you're if you're into that, you know what happens in the forest

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:32.020
Uh, where where has it happened quark, huh? Where has it happened? I'm sure you're describing this because you're very familiar

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:37.380
I'm just trying to get to the bottom. I think it's great that you're a lady that likes to strap on a dick and fucking feel much

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:42.620
Oh, I think it's that's right. There's nothing to be ashamed of my children died in a fire

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.900
Maybe if you hadn't been busy fucking asses and stuff

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.900
I

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:53.140
Have been a better mother you fucking act. I pull Sharpie aside

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.220
Foreign aside. Well, that happens

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:02.340
I play my lute in the background

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:06.380
Hey, you play decently. I'm sorry

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.900
I'm sorry about my friend

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:14.220
It's fine. I just I wish he was more honest with himself

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.220
about

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.340
What he would like I

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:28.100
Yes, my my just to clarify you read my journal entry. I'm embarrassed that it was left behind

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:46.100
But this was your home. Yes, we're standing on the ashes of my lady who's sure

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.500
Sorry guys

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:59.660
Play my loot. Do you know what? What? Do you know what happened here? I?

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:04.660
Know that there was a there was a dark night. I

01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:08.780
Had just turned off the candles. I had said good night to

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:11.180
Toby

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:13.820
Melissa fence. How do you how do you turn a candle off?

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:19.540
I'm having a side you blow it out. You blow it out. Okay?

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:26.060
And she's by the stairway to heaven

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:33.060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My friend is he and I take shits together

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.460
That's not all they take together

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:57.620
I said good night to all of my children. I fell asleep. I awoke. What were the you were gonna name your children in order?

01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.620
Yes, all five of them. Yes

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:03.780
Toby yeah, Melissa fence, okay sugar. Yeah

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.780
I

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.300
Danielle and Robert

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.500
And Robert I

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:20.580
I turned off the candles and I felt a great heat I

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:25.420
Say turned off because I'm very casual of candles. They don't know what switch is I

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:34.820
I felt as a strong heat and I I woke up to see my children all all of their

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.260
Heads were on fire their hair was on fire

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.660
You should have turned them off

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:51.900
He's so proud of himself so proud of himself

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:55.340
Ah, Jeff Davis hates a radio lab. Um, I

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.340
I

01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:03.500
Turn I tried to turn them off. I I tried so hard to turn them off

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:09.360
Jesus stayed on and they stayed on all the all the way down

01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:17.940
I tried to turn myself on I tried to set myself on fire, but I wouldn't I wouldn't light I

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.420
Wouldn't light

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:22.420
Perhaps there's some magic there

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:29.500
Like like the lady in Game of Thrones like you can't be on fire

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:34.140
Yes, yes, precisely. I may be part dragon

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:41.140
but I I would not set on fire and I left the house and I I knew that I would be a

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:48.940
terrible mother to another child and I I knew that an arrow would kill whatever was there, so I

01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:52.020
Divorce yes, what exactly?

01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:04.400
Well as as as you know most enemies can be defeated by arrows, so I took up the the sport of

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.740
arrowing

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:10.300
That's the hell fuck half-elf word for it

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:16.660
And I I and I joined you so you don't know what did this to your people's

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.660
I

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:24.260
I I don't okay, I I

01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:29.820
Saw you two traveling and I hoped that I could latch on to you and maybe you would help me

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.460
Also, I've fallen in love with you during this

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:36.900
And I you

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.980
I am so sorry about my gay friend I

01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:44.980
I

01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:49.900
Love him too deeply. I want a whole lot of love

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:57.340
And when the whole lot of love yeah, and he loves what's up with Sharpie

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:03.820
Sharpie, let's join him. Please don't tell him what I said about falling in love with you

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:10.060
I I would like to find a belt because I do still possess a sword between my legs and I

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:14.100
I'd like to revert to my previous self

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:26.900
Hey, sorry guys, I was bored to play my loot that Sharpie explained to me really quickly what just happened quark

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:31.500
We we we we really honestly nothing has changed

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:37.740
I don't know what we took a long time. I was sitting over there playing my loot for a while

01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:40.220
Well, I think you should be less mean to

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.140
Mullbrain

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:45.140
All right, you know

01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.860
She's a sensitive person. Okay

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.940
And this was her home

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:55.860
Yeah, her children burnt to death. Yeah, I feel pretty bad about that

01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.820
Came down pretty hard on

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.260
So I can turn and candles off and I'm a little

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:10.660
I'm a little overwhelmed, but like I want to avenge the death of your children and I want my dad to be safe

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:18.380
I I feel like that the force that destroyed my children is the same that is after your dad

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:21.380
It's a good chance, right? Probably my movie logic

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:26.260
Mary, you don't see a lot of movies or it's like I have an octopus did this but there's also a werewolf

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.940
But that was as cool as that would be

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.700
It's probably Admiral Darkstar, I guess

01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.300
What a lot of SM3

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:50.180
Parker in the audience. All right. Well, I think we should proceed toward the bus a lot encampment

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:55.180
Yeah, where my dad said a long time ago you guys from where right Spencer. We know how to head there

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:59.740
Oh, yeah, totally. Yeah, well, we do that and end this segment. Yeah, it's over

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.500
Dungeons and Dragons

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.340
How you like that, Austin?

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.060
I think that shit was advanced

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.740
Eric McGathey is more

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:22.660
Spencer and I will be selling merch in the thing. Yeah, and really quick

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.580
This city is the best city in the world

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:33.780
I have to agree have to agree. Let's look at some queso after this

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:41.380
I would call it the Paris of Texas, but there's some dipshit like Paris of Texas, isn't there?

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:48.940
Yeah, yeah, but it really is the Paris of Texas. It's the San Francisco of the not the not

01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:51.140
California's I don't know

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:55.300
California in Texas we should we should get along we should form an alliance

01:12:55.780 --> 01:13:01.620
Imagine if imagine if we stood up to the whole country and said, you know, let us smoke weed and

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:08.400
Don't mess with California either, right

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.320
We'll find we'll find a happy medium on toast size. Yeah

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:19.080
Because really it's little doesn't need to be that's you know, that's got to be all your

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:26.440
Maybe we'll make a Nevada toast. Oh, you're all your microchips all of your movies all of your television like we could we could we could take

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:30.560
You know, who needs the rest of the who needs these fuckers that we're going to next

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.840
I'll probably find a way to love them when we hit Nashville

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:42.440
But you guys have been amazing. Should we what do we do like are we we're ready to find it?

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.440
You know, we could try and this is you might not like it

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.760
but we have some music here created by Ryan elder who's our musical director and

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:54.740
There's a country song you think maybe you could take what you've gleaned from from this audience tonight

01:13:54.740 --> 01:14:06.740
You guys gave us a pretty easy ride that you were working pretty hard last night in Phoenix, but this was a this was like being a nice comfy hammock. So

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:10.820
And it's it's not like but just not to say that the people in Phoenix made me work harder

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:15.100
I I learned you made yourself work. I cut my teeth in Phoenix. Yeah, I punished myself

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:20.740
But it's not like you've gone through a big like like heroic journey tonight where you found out like like you had to you know

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:24.020
rise from ashes like a Phoenix and then come back up and

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:28.380
Learn to maybe it was just nice and easy and fun all the way through. It's that's it's you know

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:32.180
Doesn't make for a great heroic tale, you know, maybe a

01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:36.860
How about this maybe sing like a kind of maybe a little sad song or something like that

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:41.580
Maybe country style about about you know about having to leave this this beautiful town. We can try it. All right

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:46.380
Let's give it a whirl. All right, if not, we bring a Jen Brown up and we sing the peepee poopoo

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:53.180
Oh, yeah, who knows what we'll just we'll just dive into the audience and root then run for the back door

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:56.060
Yeah, Jen Jen stay loose. Here we go

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:04.460
The shuffleboard shuffle

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:14.980
I left my heart in Texas, but I left my foot in Maine. I

01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:20.380
Left my hand in Idaho and never quite the same

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:26.260
Different parts of my body have been left in different states

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:32.580
It all depends on where I was and what I chose to ate I

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:37.780
Had pancakes yesterday and took a poop with Jeff

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:44.780
I'm up here dancing round and now I'm out of breath two three four

01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:50.700
Hokey pokey in the back room in a Hickey picky on the hi ho in a

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.700
Hope

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.940
I think that's that's traditional, right?

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:13.620
That was that was some Ernest Tubb shit going on and I was like I think I'm welcome back here any time

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:18.660
Yeah, Dan is gonna be at the broken spoke on Thursday

01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:25.100
You guys have been unreasonably fantastic, and I don't know what else we can possibly bring Jim Brack

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:29.860
Uh, Jim Brown back up and we sing you maybe so a couple couple a little bit of rap and we finish

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:33.820

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:36.740

He actually not he's seriously a man. Is he going a man dressed like the world's sexiest valet parker

01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:00.060

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:09.940
Asked if requested that Dan not only sing a rap about fucking his mother he's searching through he's

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:16.020
Satchel for a photo of his mother. This is the weirdest fetish. I've ever come across

Literally she's home we doors open we're gonna introduce him to D-Lux in Phoenix. Yeah

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:28.780
Yeah, why'd you find it you didn't bring it I?

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:36.180
Find that photo man. Wait. Did you bring a photo of your mother so that Dan would fuck it or that you do you carry a photo?

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:40.340
Loving mother that you like to have strangers fuck in lieu of your mom's photo

It's been a good night. I'm flowing rap. I hope I don't do it mouse trap. I'm just

01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:36.420
Rhymen words about shit flying out my mouth like projectile turds. I'm gonna throw it out to outer space

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:40.580
So hope everyone in Austin likes me regardless of my race

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:45.820
Because I'm white. I don't want to do anything bad tonight

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:51.820
