{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:14.000\nHello Austin, Texas.\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:20.000\nHarmontown is now officially in session.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:24.000\nThank you so much for coming out.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:27.000\nDay two of the Harmontown tour.\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:38.000\nPlease put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:43.000\nHoly shit! Holy shit!\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:48.000\nHoly shit!\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:55.000\nBig room full of amazing people. Holy shit. Amazing.\n\n00:55.000 --> 01:00.000\nThank you. You're applauding yourselves, you sons of bitches.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:03.000\nGod damn it, we're never leaving this city.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:08.000\nWe had a great time in Phoenix. We learned some painful lessons, mostly about myself.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:13.000\nThey were good people in Phoenix. I made a complete ass of myself going out there.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:20.000\nThey loved me, and I flung myself under the sharpened rocks of my own self-hatred.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:24.000\nIn a regular show, a comic could come out and go,\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:28.000\nHey, knock knock, who's there? Your mom's there?\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:30.000\nAnd then there'd be a guy in the audience that go,\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:35.000\nYou suck! That's the dynamic, that's what a heckler is.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:38.000\nIt's completely inverted with me because I have no act,\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:42.000\nand then I come up and go, I'm a bad person, and then people in the audience go,\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:46.000\nYou're doing fine!\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:49.000\nWe love you!\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:53.000\nSeason two of Community made me cry!\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:57.000\nJust keep going, and I start going,\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\nFuck you, fuck you, pal! What do you know?\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.000\nDan actually started heckling the audience's love.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:07.000\nI did, I really did, and it was, you know, the show in Phoenix went fine,\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:09.000\nbut I learned my lesson, it was like, you know what?\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:12.000\nLet's accept some love as we go out here on the road,\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:15.000\nbecause I was, you know, the automatic thought was like,\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:19.000\nwe live in Los Angeles and we live in the back of a comic book store, we do the show,\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:23.000\nand now we're going on the road, so your automatic thought is,\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:27.000\nmy mom's out there, you know, like she's somewhere out there,\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:31.000\nthese are different people, like they're gonna judge me,\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:34.000\nor like the crowds are gonna be filled with people who are like,\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:37.000\nyou know, let's go see some comedy tonight, honey.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:39.000\nWho's this guy? What's he doing?\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:43.000\nBut you all listen to the podcast, right?\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nSo, we're fine, we're fine.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:52.000\nAnd my only job is to pretend that we're in Los Angeles, at Harmontown.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:55.000\nI think what we found last night, to our surprise,\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:58.000\nand I think what we're gonna find as we go is that the people that come to the show\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nare gonna resemble our hometown crowd for a bit.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:05.000\nPretty much, like they're all, they look a lot like,\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:09.000\nI walk in the door in Austin or Phoenix,\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:13.000\nand the guy I make eye contact with who's holding the thing for me to sign\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:17.000\nis the same guy as in Los Angeles, like, he might be,\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nhe might look like he could kick my ass, he might have tattoos,\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:23.000\nhe might have glasses, he might be short, he might be fat, he might be thin,\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:27.000\nbut there's that misfit quality, and then our eyes meet across the room,\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:30.000\nand happened with some guy, I think his name was Jesse or something,\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:32.000\nit was the first guy I came into the, I came into the, there was a guy,\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:35.000\nI was like, hey, kind of waved at me like I worked with him,\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nand I was like, yeah, hey, and I knew, I don't work with you,\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:42.000\nbut it's like the different patterns of facial hair,\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:48.000\nand the just lovely, wonderful, wonderful, an army of nerds,\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:54.000\nI love it, like, just showering me with love,\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nand all I can do is fuck it up, alright, I'm tailspinning,\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nI'm gonna fuck it up.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:03.000\nYou know what's amazing, Dan, the first time I think that you met Charlie Kaufman,\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:06.000\nyou guys know the writer, Charlie Kaufman, and yeah,\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:10.000\nand Harmon, Charlie came to like a screening of, it was a community thing,\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:13.000\nlike it was a Christmas thing, I think, and Charlie came,\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nand they met, and Dan obviously really wanted to meet Charlie,\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nand I think Charlie was like happy to meet you,\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nand they had this great conversation, they talked all day,\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:22.000\nbut you never saw less eye contact in a conversation,\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:27.000\nthere was just two guys in the same plaid shirt staring at their own shoes.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:33.000\nYeah, there's a mannerism.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nThose are my people, that's my people,\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:40.000\nwe feel more than we can handle, we love each other.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\nOh, but speaking of feeling things and apologizing for things,\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:47.000\nthis was almost Kettle One, but then I remembered where we were,\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:48.000\nso this is Tito's.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:51.000\nTito's, fucking Tito's.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nCan I make you one, you want one?\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nYes, please, thank you.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:57.000\nOne of the 85,000 great things about Texas,\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:03.000\nthey have a grassroots homemade vodka called Tito's,\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nthat is delicious, it's too delicious.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nWait, my friend Ray Pruitt, who's here tonight,\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nif I'm not mistaken, Ray, you know Tito, don't you?\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:10.000\nHaven't you met him?\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:11.000\nIs Ray here?\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nYou met him, yeah.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:17.000\nI met him!\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nWhen Tito started making Tito's vodka,\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.000\nit was just him in a garage making this on his own, right?\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:29.000\nWell, that's the story I told you.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:33.000\nIt's a weird, it's pitch black back there,\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:36.000\nand I don't know what the mics are picking up,\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:41.000\nbut as the story goes, Tito's vodka is made by a human being\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:46.000\nand not a corporation, and now it's a corporation,\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:49.000\nbut it's every bit as delicious as Kettle One,\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nwho did not sponsor our tour.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nWe nearly had a bottle of Kettle One up here,\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nbut fuck those guys, it's Tito's all the way.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:00.000\nIt feels a little weird drinking out of a soda glass, but...\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:08.000\nKettle One is kind of the Nike of vodka's...\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:13.000\nKettle One, the racist vodka.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:14.000\nYou hear that, you fuckers?\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nYou fuckers had a chance.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nWe were going to put a big sticker on the side of our bus\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:22.000\nand make our bus like shape like a Kettle One bottle.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:23.000\nWe would have done anything.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nUntil we found out about that racial stuff.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nYeah.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:35.000\nKettle One, sitting on Nazi gold since 1945,\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nand also making vodka, I guess that's their new racket,\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:42.000\nbut those in the know...\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:46.000\nKettle One, baby rapers.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:50.000\nKettle One, more like Kettle Two.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:53.000\nMeaning we pooped in it, you fuckers.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nKettle One, fuck, yeah, fuck it.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:01.000\nHere's another fan of the 800 reasons to be glad we're in Texas.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:04.000\nTexas, I hate to play favorites.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nI'm from California, I love California.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:10.000\nCalifornia and Texas, they're not so different.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:16.000\nCows and oil and we have weed and movies.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:17.000\nFake tits.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nI'm not going to be a fake ambassador.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:26.000\nI'm going to come here, I'm very proud of being a Californian.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:33.000\nCalifornia and Texas, though, we could kick the whole nation's ass.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:37.000\nWe are the first and second in terms of gross national product\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nor whatever you call it on the state level, probably gross state product.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nIt's California and then Texas.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nWe're basically tied.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:48.000\nEach state could be a country unto itself.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:53.000\nTexas's history, you know that phrase, six flags over Texas.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nYou know the significance of that.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nI do not.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:57.000\nI do.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:00.000\nI Wikipedia it.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nWho's the governor?\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:06.000\nMichael Dean Anderson.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nReally?\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:08.000\nYeah.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nMacGyver?\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:12.000\nYes, the brother of MacGyver.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nJust back me up, guys.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:18.000\nI'll slip out the back and pretend that you're governor tonight.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nIt's the MacGyver's brother.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nHe's so good.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nThey're such good people.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nWho is the governor?\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nWhat's his name?\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:28.000\nRick Perry.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:29.000\nCan't hear you.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nGovernor Bloomberg?\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nRick Perry.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:37.000\nOh, right, Rick Perry, the guy with the game show here.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nRick Perry.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nHe sounds sexy.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nI believe he's an idiot because he's a governor.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:47.000\nI don't know what geniuses have ever become a politician.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nYou don't wake up in bed and go, oh, my brain's so active.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nI should tell people what to do.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nIt doesn't make any sense.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nIf you're smart, you make shit.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:01.000\nOr jerk off and play video games.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:07.000\nShut up, Ray.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:12.000\nThe Rick Flare of jerking off and playing video games just back here.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:17.000\nThat's what I'm talking about.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:21.000\nSix Flags Over Texas refers to the state's history.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nIt's an amazing history.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:28.000\nThey've been owned by, it's a territory that's been owned by the French\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:33.000\nfor a brief period, the Spanish, then it was a territory of Mexico.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nThen, and I don't know what other states shares this.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nI really don't.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:38.000\nThere might be some.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:39.000\nWhat?\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:40.000\nNone.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:46.000\nBecame their own fucking republic.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nIt's a sparse applause for that.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nEveryone else is like, I don't know.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nNo, it's fucking cool.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.000\nCome on.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\nThere's nothing.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:57.000\nI don't think any citizens of the state are more proud of being from a state than Texans.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:00.000\nI think it's more state pride here than anywhere else.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nIt's just a cool concept.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:07.000\nI love the idea that we belong to a nation that was like, it's a federalized empire.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nAt one point we had to go door to door and go, you joining us?\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:11.000\nYou joining us?\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:15.000\nAnd Texas was like, yeah, right.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:18.000\nCouple conditions, you know.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:22.000\nYou get a 50 year lease with an option to buy.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nAnd we have to be shaped like a ninja star.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nThat's fucking cool, too.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:32.000\nIt's the only state that if you threw it, it could take your eye out.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nFlorida would hit you.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:37.000\nEven if it hit you right in the eye, it just bruised your eye.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:40.000\nTexas, take your fucking eye right out.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nThat's just a good point.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:45.000\nAnd there's a handle on it that you could throw it.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nYou could grab it.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:52.000\nIt should be Oklahoma, but it's like, fuck you.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nIt's like a sword handle.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:58.000\nYeah, you could cut a fucking weird cake with it and serve some shit on it.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:01.000\nYou could walk around and stab people with it.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nStab Mexico.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:09.000\nYou could be like Steve McQueen and the fucking dirty dozen and the killer guy and fucking awesome.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:17.000\nThey were their own republic and then they made a limited agreement to become part of our little club.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:22.000\nAnd then there was an uncomfortable period called the Civil War.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:25.000\nWe can talk about that later if you want.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:28.000\nI am not judging anyone.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:32.000\nAnd then there's, there should be seven flags, though, shouldn't it?\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:35.000\nBecause it's like, you got...\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nWhat's that?\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nI'm sorry, I couldn't hear that.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nYou asked twice, so you...\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nBut two different...\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:46.000\nIs that that makes the six?\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nBut why not seven?\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:51.000\nBecause of the amount of rollercoaster.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:58.000\nBecause of the amount of rollercoasters.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nIn case the mics don't pick up.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nI find one difference between California and Texas.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nWe have very different ideas about Mexican food.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nIt's very, very, very different here.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:09.000\nYou get a chili reino here and there's like nachos on it.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:10.000\nIt's very strange.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nI liked the place that we ate.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nOh, no, the place was fucked.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nTaco Cabana.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.000\nYou sent us a Taco Cabana.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:21.000\nNobody's saying that that's authentic cuisine.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nI'm not a foodie.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nAre you booing me or you booing Taco Cabana?\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nYou're booing Taco Cabana.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nThank you.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:29.000\nWe walked in there.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nThere were 17 people behind the counter\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nand there were 17 tables all covered in shit.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nAnd there was a gentleman behind the counter\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nwho was, well, he was 11 years old, I believe.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nAnd I'm like that, I said, I'll have a burrito.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nAnd he's like...\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nA buri, what?\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:47.000\nI have a bean and cheese burrito.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nAnd so he gave me a bean burrito with a thing,\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:53.000\nwith a little plastic ramekin of cheese.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:54.000\nI was like, precisely...\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:55.000\nPlastic ramekin?\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nA little plastic thing.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nA little plastic cup.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nThere's a ramekin?\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:01.000\nIs that a word?\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nYeah.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:03.000\nA ramekin.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nWhat's a ramekin?\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:05.000\nIt's like, it's usually like a little dish.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nYou put butter in or sauce or something like that.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nLike a little, a little four ounce.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nYeah, you get your ranch dressing and a little ramekin.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nThat's such a fucking ancient Greek name.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.000\nI expected to snatch me up with talons and take me to Mount Olympus.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:20.000\nRamekin was the son of Agamemnon,\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:25.000\nwho was cursed to dispense three ounces of things.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:29.000\nYeah, he stole Chipotle from the gods and gave it to a man.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:32.000\nIn an easy to handle serving.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:35.000\nBut my bean and cheese burrito, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nwas a bean burrito that was wrapped in foil\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nthat I had to take out of the foil,\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:44.000\ndo the tortilla, and then put cold cheese into it.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nThere's no cheese in the fucking kitchen at Taco Cabana,\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nand I had to make it myself, and then they give you a number,\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\nand I took my number to my table and was forgotten.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nThey never, I had to go up and get my own food.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:54.000\nI don't get it.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nThe place blows.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nAll right, fine.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nWell, you have, you have their sympathy.\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nThey wanted to let you know.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nYeah.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nAnd I'm pretty sure that, I'm vegetarian,\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nI'm pretty sure those refried beans weren't,\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:06.000\nand I'm gonna be shitting like a goose on the bus later on.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nFor my money, I'm on this special diet.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:11.000\nI had a delicious, like, it took some doing\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nto make them understand how to put it in the bowl,\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nbut I got a bunch of beef and chicken and a bowl\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:22.000\nwith some beans, and I'm about to burp it out as I said.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nBut it was good.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nIt was on my diet, and it was good, and we got out of there.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:26.000\nBut we did stop off at a friend's advice\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nto a bar called Buddy's Place, which I quite enjoyed.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nYeah.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:30.000\nHonky Tonk.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:34.000\nJeff, I want to be part of the honky tonk culture.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:35.000\nI can see that.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nYeah.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:39.000\nAnybody go to this place, Buddy's?\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:43.000\nThose are our two friends back there.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nThe men's room is simply just a trough.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:46.000\nThere's no mirror.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nThere's no sink.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nIt's just a thing.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nIt's a manger.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:53.000\nYou could feed an ox, or you could give birth to a Christ,\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:54.000\nor you could pee on it.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nAnd that's all there was in the bathroom.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nI love it.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:01.000\nAnd the bartender was like, everything was like,\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nbut not in a condescending way.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:06.000\nIt was like, and not in a colloquial way.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nAll I can drink here is a Michelob ultra,\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nbecause I'm doing the low carb thing.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nI just vodka.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:12.000\nOK, I'll take Michelob ultra.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nIt's like, OK, sweetie, all right, darling.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nEverything was sweetie and darling in alternation.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nBut it was really nice.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:22.000\nI'm not saying that she's representative of the population.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nI know every town you go to, everyone wants to know,\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nlike, oh, we're like Logan's run here.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nWe're all from the future.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:31.000\nI'm from Milwaukee.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:36.000\nI'm embarrassed to be associated with a random thing\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nyou might encounter there.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:43.000\nHere's what you don't have in Los Angeles.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:47.000\nBars with big, long ass shuffleboard, those things.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nShuffleboard is good.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:50.000\nThat shit.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nWe had that.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:54.000\nThere are a couple in LA, but they're pretty few in far between.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\nSomebody followed us from LA just to call my shit out.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nThere's one where?\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nThere's one what?\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nI think you said in LA.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:04.000\nNo, they're all over the place.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:05.000\nI'm saying they're not in LA.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:06.000\nThey're really buying lunch.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:07.000\nYeah, there's one in Culver City, I think,\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nwhere that's about it.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:09.000\nThey're all over the place.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:12.000\nI found one in Portland.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nMy uncle had one in his basement.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nJust that gritty sand shit you put on it.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nIt's a fun game, man.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nEveryone should have that.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nI don't want to get off.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\nI don't want to do the shuffleboard show.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nI don't care.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nMaybe it's time that you showed them your new dance,\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nthe shuffleboard shuffle.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:37.000\nShould we do it?\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:47.000\nWe rehearsed this for weeks.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nThat was great, Jeff.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:52.000\nThank you.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nI say give the people what they want, Dan.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nYeah.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nYour mama raps?\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nThere's going to be mama raps.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:03.000\nYou notice I didn't come out doing the mama thing\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nbecause I was like, I'm getting in a rut.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nWhen I learned in Phoenix, God bless them.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nThey were fucking wonderful.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.000\nAll they did was support me.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nBut I came out rapping about fucking your mama.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nAnd they were like, yeah.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:18.000\nI need to form a relationship with the audience\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\neverywhere I go.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nIt was getting in the way.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nI talk about fucking your mama.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nThe biggest mistake I made, Jeff,\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:28.000\nwas getting suggestions about fucking people's mamas.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:31.000\nActing like it was some kind of weird improv game.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:32.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:33.000\nThat was the worst thing.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nMy name's Steve.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nWhat's your favorite food?\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nIce cream sundaes.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nOh, I fucked Steve's mama.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nHe was eating his favorite ice cream sundaes.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:42.000\nFucking his mama.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:43.000\nAnd she died of cancer.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nDid you say she died of cancer?\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nYeah, okay.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nIt was terrible.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nI felt awful.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nI'm not an improviser.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:54.000\nI'm not one of your little who's line friends.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nYou know, your little, your Hoosie doodles.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nYou know, it's like, yeah.\n\n17:58.000 --> 17:59.000\nYeah, there's a little Greg Poopsies\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nin these Ryan Stilesies.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:04.000\nAnd they go like, oh, I'm going to do changing emotions\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:07.000\nand lift the bodies and do the arms experts.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nYou used to be an improviser though.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nYeah, but I was terrible at it.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nAnd then I became a writer.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nAnd then now I've ended up doing this because I can't,\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:18.000\nI get therapy doesn't work.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nIs this therapy for you?\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nThis is absolutely therapy.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nYeah, Andy and to Neil, these two people who live here\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\ncame back and interviewed Dan beforehand.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nAndy really gave an awesome interview about Dan\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nand asked Dan a question.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nWhy are you doing this tour?\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nAnd there's no answer for that.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nYou still don't know why you're doing this.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nI still don't know why.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nI just know I need this and I love this.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nI have lots of stuff to talk about.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:41.000\nI just checked my notepad.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nBut also the thing I decided backstage,\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\nbased on the way things have been progressing,\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nlike I want to bring Spencer up right away.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nNot to play D&G necessarily, but...\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nFor those of you who do not know, Spencer,\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nwe are the only comedy tour that's ever traveled\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:57.000\nwith our own Dungeon Master to play Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nIf you know him, you already love him.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:05.000\nIf you do not know him, prepare to Spencer Crittenden.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nHe's a national treasure.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.000\nAnd yes, he looks exactly like you thought he would.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nThank you for coming, Spencer.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nYou're welcome.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:18.000\nI don't get it.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.000\nWe're getting to know him.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nWe didn't really know him.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nWe found out last night on stage...\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nDan and I realized last night in Phoenix\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:29.000\nthat we really didn't know anything about Spencer.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:30.000\nWe knew where he lived\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nand that he works in the back room of an Apple store.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:36.000\nAnd now we learned that he has, on both feet,\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:37.000\na lot of the time,\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\na lot of the time,\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:43.000\nhe works in the back room of an Apple store,\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\nand now we learned that he has, on both feet,\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\nwhat's it called?\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:46.000\nSyndactyly.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nHe suffers from syndactylism?\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nI don't suffer from it.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nSorry, I'm sorry.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:53.000\nForgive me.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nHe's blessed with a...\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nThank you.\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:00.000\nHe has given the rare gift of having two of his...\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:03.000\nof his middle toes on each feet fused together.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nYeah.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nYeah.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:06.000\nWhich I imagine helps you.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nYes.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nLess toe jam.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nJust less stinky feet.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\n20% less.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nWould that help you, maybe,\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nin, like, if you were a swimmer, possibly?\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:19.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nI can swim circles around anybody.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nSo, we vowed to learn...\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nThat's not a joke.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nWe wanted to learn one new thing about you every night.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nIf you have anything in the chamber,\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nyou can pop it out now,\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nor you can just let it stew.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nI'll let it stew.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nOkay, great.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:35.000\nI just wanted him up there, sitting there,\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:36.000\nbecause I feel safer.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:37.000\nLike, if I'm at McMahon,\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:38.000\nit's nice to have a Doc Severance\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nand sit in over there.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:40.000\nYeah.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:41.000\nI like being able to go,\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:42.000\nwhat do you think about that, Spencer?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nOh, that!\n\n20:47.000 -->

20:56.000\nCan we talk about the...\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nBecause we went to this wonderful,\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nhonky-tonky land, the shuffleboard thing,\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:05.000\nlike, I want to talk about the Confederate flag thing.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nI mean, you don't have to act like I farted.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nThis one, there was a Confederate flag\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.000\nwith a lady on it.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:15.000\nWhat did it say?\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nRebel lady.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nRebel chick?\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:18.000\nYeah.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:19.000\nYeah.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nI don't know.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nIt's offensive to slaves and to women.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nI just...\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:26.000\nI don't know.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nI guess I remember one of these weird holdouts,\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nwhere I'm like, I think that's fine.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nIt's not like a flag that has a black person\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nwith a line through it.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nIt's not the same thing.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:41.000\nI understand the association,\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nbut it's a very political thing.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nThat would be a bad thing,\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:46.000\nand we would all go like,\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nokay, we've moved beyond that.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:51.000\nBut we haven't moved beyond struggle\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:52.000\nand political...\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.000\nTexas of all places.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nIt's like, it's the America of states.\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:01.000\nIt was a colony,\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nand it got federalized,\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nand it was like, I don't know.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nWhen I see that flag,\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:09.000\nI don't necessarily go,\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:12.000\noh, that person hates other people.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nWe've all been trained to be ashamed of it,\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nlike it's a swastika or something.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:19.000\nI don't think it's the same thing.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nI just wanted to mention it.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nI don't know how you guys feel about it\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:27.000\nas a progressive southerners.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nI never talked to somebody from the south.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:31.000\nIs this the south?\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nYou don't think of yourself as a southerly, do you?\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nYou're Texas.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:39.000\nForgive me, but there's this compass.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:46.000\nI back you up a hundred percent.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nI don't mean to offend you.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:52.000\nI just meant the south,\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:55.000\nas opposed to the top half of the fucking country.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nDan, did I ever tell the story on the podcast,\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nor maybe if someone listens to it,\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\ndid I ever tell the story about me being named Jeff Davis\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nand me being in the south?\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nI don't know if you did.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.000\nYou don't think so?\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nNo.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nYeah, my name is Jeff Davis,\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:12.000\nand my parents were Yankees.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nThey were from Nebraska and Ohio\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nwhen their little kids moved west during the Dust Bowl,\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:18.000\nand never been to the south.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:19.000\nMy name's Jeffrey Davis.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:20.000\nIt's not Jefferson Davis.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nWe're not southerners.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:24.000\nNo one in my family's ever lived in the south.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nBut I was somewhere in Louisiana once,\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nand I went to a liquor store in the morning.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:31.000\nI was walking from a girl's place to my hotel,\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:32.000\nand it was a huge, long walk.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nYeah.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nAnd it was a really long walk,\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nbut it was in a very black neighborhood,\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nand I was this only white guy walking,\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:44.000\nlike little girls and boys are going to school.\n\n23:44.000 -->

black suit.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:55.000\nI'm super pale and hungover,\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nand I'm coming down the road,\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:59.000\nand little kids are crossing the street to go around me.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nAnd I clearly was not up to any good there.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nAnd I go into a liquor store,\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nand my cell phone was

that once upon a time, people didn't\n\n26:43.560 --> 26:47.760\ntell people what to do quite as much, it's like, are you going to erase it from history\n\n26:47.760 --> 26:50.360\nand you're going to politicize it and overcharge it?\n\n26:50.360 --> 26:55.320\nThat's why I'm always like, it's not my right to intrude upon that, but I feel like I, growing\n\n26:55.320 --> 27:01.400\nup in Wisconsin, I'm part of some weird federal machine that, I have no idea how people feel,\n\n27:01.400 --> 27:03.720\nhow they really feel, what offends people.\n\n27:03.720 --> 27:10.560\nAnd I used to feel that way about guns too, like that shit went crazy recently, but I\n\n27:10.560 --> 27:15.880\nalways felt like, I couldn't be more liberal, I'm left of liberal, I'm so left of liberal\n\n27:15.880 --> 27:24.000\nthat I seem right-winged at my liberal friends, because I'm so left that I just want to burn\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:29.680\ndown the White House and like, build a statue of myself pissing on-\n\n27:29.680 --> 27:36.680\nGood night everybody, thanks for coming.\n\n27:36.680 --> 27:42.560\nYo, yo, yo, burn down the White House, it's too white, let's get some torches, burn it\n\n27:42.560 --> 27:48.280\ndown tonight, we're gonna march up the avenue, that's what it's for, knock on that motherfucking\n\n27:48.280 --> 27:58.800\npresident's door and say, whose house is this, motherfucker, yeah, who it, I don't know.\n\n27:58.800 --> 28:06.080\nThat was the Anarchist Rap, yeah, I'm sure Mikhail Bakunin would have signed off on that\n\n28:06.080 --> 28:07.080\none.\n\n28:07.080 --> 28:11.720\nBut I, like, the gun thing is like, I don't know, it's like, like, it is-\n\n28:11.720 --> 28:15.320\nDid you just fuck the White House's front door, what was that about?\n\n28:15.320 --> 28:28.720\nFor those in podcast land, I humped, I mimed humping the White House's front door, sensually.\n\n28:28.720 --> 28:34.960\nI know, that whole right to bear arms thing, it seduces me, and this is the worst time\n\n28:34.960 --> 28:40.160\nof all to ever say that, that fucking guy, like, you know, the thing happened and the\n\n28:40.160 --> 28:46.640\nguy said the stuff and like, it's too politically charged, but I can't get past that concept\n\n28:46.640 --> 28:50.800\nof like, well, I don't know, there's weird shit about me that makes me go, yeah, but\n\n28:50.800 --> 28:55.920\nI don't know, who wants to be part of a machine, it's fucking dumb, like, I thought the whole\n\n28:55.920 --> 28:59.960\npoint of this country, I thought the thing that made us sexy was that we didn't want\n\n28:59.960 --> 29:04.160\nto be part of a machine, I thought the reason we called it the United States is because\n\n29:04.160 --> 29:09.960\nit was like, you know, I don't know, it's too politically charged, though, they shove\n\n29:09.960 --> 29:15.440\nthe shit down our throats where it's like, the idea of dichotomy, the idea of a bipartisan\n\n29:15.440 --> 29:19.800\nsystem, the idea that you're either with one side or the other, that's the greatest trick\n\n29:19.800 --> 29:23.600\nthat devil ever played, like, the idea that you're not allowed to be a single human being\n\n29:23.600 --> 29:28.160\nand go like, yeah, but I want this and I want that, like, and then you just have people\n\n29:28.160 --> 29:31.840\nfrom both sides telling you, yeah, but whose side are you on, like, because one of them\n\n29:31.840 --> 29:39.480\nis like a Hitler, and it's just not true, but it's like, yeah, I don't know, it makes\n\n29:39.480 --> 29:46.880\nme nervous, you know, you can hear the people eating their hot wings, like, I could say\n\n29:46.880 --> 29:49.880\nanything, I could just, you know, like, fuse and blow something up.\n\n29:49.880 --> 29:53.560\nBut I know you don't like political conversations, but I have a question for you. How do you\n\n29:53.560 --> 29:55.560\nfeel about Obama's mother?\n\n29:55.560 --> 29:57.560\nAll right, well.\n\n29:57.560 --> 30:09.560\nI fucked Obama's mama in the city. I fucked Obama's mama with brother titties. I went\n\n30:09.560 --> 30:16.560\nto Obama, said, can I fuck your mama? He said, my name's Obama, he rhymes with mama, so I\n\n30:16.560 --> 30:22.560\ngo to Lama. I fucked Obama. I don't know, yeah, that's how I feel.\n\n30:22.560 --> 30:24.560\nSo you'd fuck her, too.\n\n30:24.560 --> 30:25.560\nYeah, I'd fuck her, too.\n\n30:25.560 --> 30:27.560\nOh, yeah, I'd hit that.\n\n30:27.560 --> 30:30.560\nAre any mamas, are any mamas safe?\n\n30:30.560 --> 30:37.560\nNo, no, not for me, and I'm blessed to live in a country where it's okay to say that.\n\n30:37.560 --> 30:42.560\nAnyone whose mama I want to fuck, I could say, I want to fuck your mama. President Obama,\n\n30:42.560 --> 30:49.560\nare you listening? I would like to fuck your mama. And the reason I voted for him is because\n\n30:49.560 --> 30:55.560\nI think he would go, all right, well, I guess that's what he wants to do.\n\n30:55.560 --> 31:00.560\nAs opposed to somebody who would go like, what did you say? I'm gonna fucking arrest you and put you\n\n31:00.560 --> 31:01.560\nin Guantanamo.\n\n31:01.560 --> 31:03.560\nObama would say, I hope you fuck my mama.\n\n31:03.560 --> 31:08.560\nMaybe, I don't know. Stimulate the package of the thing or whatever.\n\n31:08.560 --> 31:13.560\nI hope you change my mama's pussy.\n\n31:13.560 --> 31:16.560\nWe're supposed to be the government, we're supposed to be...\n\n31:16.560 --> 31:19.560\nYou wouldn't fuck Spencer's mama, would you? You met her the other day, she was a very lovely woman.\n\n31:19.560 --> 31:25.560\nI would, you know, I'd take a crack.\n\n31:25.560 --> 31:30.560\nYo, Spencer, I saw your mama yesterday.\n\n31:30.560 --> 31:34.560\nIt was two days ago.\n\n31:34.560 --> 31:35.560\nYou see, you can't do it.\n\n31:35.560 --> 31:39.560\nYeah, you can't do it.\n\n31:39.560 --> 31:43.560\nThat's the important thing, humanity.\n\n31:43.560 --> 31:48.560\nI think I'd fuck Obama's mama, but if he was here, I'd probably just shake his hand and say,\n\n31:48.560 --> 31:51.560\nthank you for running the country.\n\n31:51.560 --> 31:56.560\nAnd I think he would thank me for doing a good show.\n\n31:56.560 --> 31:59.560\nSo you're just cowing to his power, to his status?\n\n31:59.560 --> 32:04.560\nI don't know, I think then he'd go away and he'd say to somebody, I'd fuck that dude's mama.\n\n32:04.560 --> 32:08.560\nYeah, but you fuck members of our audience, mama's all the time.\n\n32:08.560 --> 32:11.560\nAre you saying that they're lesser than Obama, that their mamas are more vulnerable?\n\n32:11.560 --> 32:18.560\nWhen I rap about fucking your mama, I'm using the royal your mama.\n\n32:18.560 --> 32:25.560\nI don't mean... I know that many of your mamas are dead, or dying.\n\n32:25.560 --> 32:28.560\nYeah, you can hear them...\n\n32:28.560 --> 32:33.560\nMy mother died when I was 13, you want to fuck her?\n\n32:33.560 --> 32:36.560\nI don't want to get specific.\n\n32:36.560 --> 32:41.560\nIt's like the art form of wanting to fuck your mama.\n\n32:41.560 --> 32:49.560\nYour mama's bigger than any individual.\n\n32:49.560 --> 32:51.560\nWhat?\n\n32:51.560 --> 32:53.560\nYes, I'm saying yes.\n\n32:53.560 --> 32:56.560\nShe's literally bigger than any individual.\n\n32:56.560 --> 32:57.560\nYes.\n\n32:57.560 --> 33:02.560\nWhen your mama represents the collective, she represents the whole collective.\n\n33:02.560 --> 33:12.560\nI don't want to say your mama is fat and important to me, but she's bigger than any individual.\n\n33:12.560 --> 33:20.560\nWhen your mama occupies my thoughts, she occupies my thoughts.\n\n33:20.560 --> 33:29.560\nThere are agrarian societies that would consider her in charge of the cycles of the moon.\n\n33:29.560 --> 33:33.560\nPeople would be honored to nail her.\n\n33:33.560 --> 33:38.560\nI think it was nice that Eric Eitel came on our goodbye show in Los Angeles and sang about fucking your mama.\n\n33:38.560 --> 33:41.560\nDid you guys hear that? That was amazing.\n\n33:41.560 --> 33:47.560\nWe wrote a Money Python member, Eric, our buddy. We wrote him a song that was like, he's never going to sing it.\n\n33:47.560 --> 33:52.560\nIt was just about a fucking dad, a dance dad, and nuzzle in his nuts.\n\n33:52.560 --> 33:55.560\nDan and I were just in heaven. It was the greatest.\n\n33:55.560 --> 33:59.560\nWe wrote a song for a Money Python guy. We wrote that song.\n\n33:59.560 --> 34:03.560\nI was like, fuck your mama, nuzzle in his nuts, and then the guy from Money Python sang it.\n\n34:03.560 --> 34:05.560\nIt was a humble brag.\n\n34:09.560 --> 34:11.560\nLet me check my notepad.\n\n34:11.560 --> 34:19.560\nThere was a couple of Texas things while we were here that we can't talk about anywhere else.\n\n34:19.560 --> 34:22.560\nDo you think our angry bus driver is here in the audience?\n\n34:22.560 --> 34:24.560\nI don't know. Morgan is our driver here?\n\n34:24.560 --> 34:27.560\nNope. Fire away, fire away.\n\n34:27.560 --> 34:30.560\nThis guy is complicated.\n\n34:30.560 --> 34:34.560\nHe has a sense of humor. I just don't know what it is yet.\n\n34:34.560 --> 34:46.560\nI detect, here's my, I feel like at one point he was driving like Gallagher or Louis Anderson in a bus,\n\n34:46.560 --> 34:49.560\nand then he was like, he's full of joy in life.\n\n34:49.560 --> 34:54.560\nAnd it was like, hey, you like smashing watermelons, maybe you should smash an orange.\n\n34:54.560 --> 34:59.560\nAnd Gallagher was like, keep driving, you fucking lackey piece of shit.\n\n34:59.560 --> 35:05.560\nAnd he looked forward, and then X-ray of his heart went click.\n\n35:05.560 --> 35:08.560\nAnd then he became his current personality.\n\n35:08.560 --> 35:14.560\nWell, I don't know. Apparently on that bus, he's driven Slayer and Sticks quite a bit, which I think is pretty cool.\n\n35:14.560 --> 35:19.560\nAnd I think he, yeah. And he had very nice things to say about both bands.\n\n35:19.560 --> 35:27.560\nHe has this gruff, he does things like, we're all hanging out in the bus, and then it's driving,\n\n35:27.560 --> 35:32.560\nand then he appears from one of the bunks and then comes up to the front and goes up to the front.\n\n35:32.560 --> 35:35.560\nFor a while we had another driver because it was too long of a drive.\n\n35:35.560 --> 35:41.560\nAnd then he goes like, hey guys, little bit of a tour bus etiquette 101.\n\n35:41.560 --> 35:47.560\nIf you're hanging out and someone's sleeping in the back, close the door between the things.\n\n35:47.560 --> 35:49.560\nClose the door.\n\n35:49.560 --> 35:56.560\nAnd then the director of the movie said, hey, a little bit of humanity 101.\n\n35:56.560 --> 35:59.560\nIf you hate your job, stop doing it.\n\n35:59.560 --> 36:04.560\nWhich was such a...\n\n36:04.560 --> 36:09.560\nSee, I feel weird talking about this because this guy is going to be behind the wheel\n\n36:09.560 --> 36:14.560\nfor an entire tour around the country, including the Northeast during January.\n\n36:14.560 --> 36:18.560\nYeah, and if he decides, he's going to go, you know what? Fuck it.\n\n36:18.560 --> 36:23.560\nHe's going to go Christopher Walken from Annie Hall on this.\n\n36:23.560 --> 36:25.560\nBut, you know, I don't know.\n\n36:25.560 --> 36:27.560\nWell, what do you want me to do?\n\n36:27.560 --> 36:32.560\nI have to say, that aside, he keeps it between the lines and he hasn't scared me yet.\n\n36:32.560 --> 36:34.560\nThere's some scary drivers out there.\n\n36:34.560 --> 36:38.560\nI've gone to sleep in that bunk and I've never felt like the telltale signs of a bad driver.\n\n36:38.560 --> 36:41.560\nYeah, all right. Well, a new update in the next city.\n\n36:41.560 --> 36:44.560\nWe're forming relationships that we never knew.\n\n36:44.560 --> 36:50.560\nHe looks exactly like Jeff Daniels and he's objectively ashamed of it.\n\n36:50.560 --> 36:53.560\nIt's nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n36:53.560 --> 36:56.560\nI know. That's what I told him.\n\n36:56.560 --> 36:59.560\nSome Jeff Daniels hater over there.\n\n36:59.560 --> 37:03.560\nOr maybe a guy who looks just like Jeff Daniels and he's like...\n\n37:03.560 --> 37:05.560\nWith a pinch of Coulier.\n\n37:05.560 --> 37:10.560\nA little full house, Dave Coulier.\n\n37:10.560 --> 37:12.560\nI'm only putting this on record.\n\n37:12.560 --> 37:14.560\nCome on, Jason, get up here.\n\n37:14.560 --> 37:16.560\nNo, I'm kidding. He's not here.\n\n37:16.560 --> 37:19.560\nOh, God damn it.\n\n37:19.560 --> 37:23.560\nJeff, why don't you like the song Hey Ya by Outcast?\n\n37:23.560 --> 37:30.560\nWhen everyone else in the world loves it.\n\n37:30.560 --> 37:32.560\nAmbushed.\n\n37:32.560 --> 37:33.560\nAmbushed.\n\n37:33.560 --> 37:35.560\nI don't like it. It's a bad song.\n\n37:35.560 --> 37:37.560\nNo, you know, it's not a bad song.\n\n37:37.560 --> 37:39.560\nThere's a very good reason why I hate it.\n\n37:39.560 --> 37:41.560\nI don't like popular things to begin with.\n\n37:41.560 --> 37:46.560\nI kind of have a very uncharming, unnecessary aversion to popular things.\n\n37:46.560 --> 37:51.560\nI must say it's a bad song.\n\n37:51.560 --> 37:53.560\nI think it does exactly what it ought to do.\n\n37:53.560 --> 37:55.560\nIt's a pop song. It's a popular song. It should be.\n\n37:55.560 --> 37:58.560\nBut we used to go to this one little bar or restaurant in my neighborhood in Los Feliz.\n\n37:58.560 --> 37:59.560\nShut the fuck up.\n\n37:59.560 --> 38:01.560\nI'm kidding. I'm kidding.\n\n38:01.560 --> 38:03.560\nI'm a little on edge.\n\n38:03.560 --> 38:05.560\nHey ya. Hey ya.\n\n38:05.560 --> 38:06.560\nI guess it got it.\n\n38:06.560 --> 38:08.560\nOh, I think you pooped it.\n\n38:08.560 --> 38:09.560\nI pooped my trousers.\n\n38:09.560 --> 38:10.560\nNo, I think I pooped it.\n\n38:10.560 --> 38:11.560\nI pooped.\n\n38:11.560 --> 38:12.560\nOkay, you don't know.\n\n38:12.560 --> 38:13.560\nIt's a fuck. It's not a good song.\n\n38:13.560 --> 38:15.560\nIt's a shitty song.\n\n38:15.560 --> 38:16.560\nHere's my problem with that song.\n\n38:16.560 --> 38:20.560\nYou couldn't go anywhere for 17 months without hearing that thing 15 times a day.\n\n38:20.560 --> 38:22.560\nI don't like over.\n\n38:22.560 --> 38:25.560\nAlso, I would never walk on a plane and be carrying the DaVinci code.\n\n38:25.560 --> 38:27.560\nI would blow my brains out.\n\n38:27.560 --> 38:30.560\nI don't want to have a book and see 15 other people reading the same book.\n\n38:30.560 --> 38:31.560\nDoes that make me cool?\n\n38:31.560 --> 38:32.560\nNo.\n\n38:32.560 --> 38:33.560\nI just don't want to.\n\n38:33.560 --> 38:36.560\nI'm never going to read The Celestial Prophecy or any of that shit.\n\n38:36.560 --> 38:39.560\nI'm sure they're great books, but I just don't want to.\n\n38:39.560 --> 38:41.560\nIt's not a sexy thing.\n\n38:41.560 --> 38:42.560\nI'm not boasting.\n\n38:42.560 --> 38:43.560\nI shouldn't be like this.\n\n38:43.560 --> 38:44.560\nAll right.\n\n38:44.560 --> 38:45.560\nI just wanted to jump.\n\n38:45.560 --> 38:47.560\nI made a list of stuff to talk about.\n\n38:47.560 --> 38:49.560\nI think it was overplayed for me.\n\n38:49.560 --> 38:50.560\nI didn't need that much of it.\n\n38:50.560 --> 38:52.560\nI think it's a real toe tapper.\n\n38:52.560 --> 38:53.560\nNo, you don't.\n\n38:53.560 --> 38:55.560\nYou suck an ass.\n\n38:55.560 --> 38:56.560\nNo, I'm not sucking ass.\n\n38:56.560 --> 38:58.560\nDid I ask them first if they like outcast?\n\n38:58.560 --> 39:00.560\nNo, you go to them.\n\n39:00.560 --> 39:02.560\nYou massage them.\n\n39:02.560 --> 39:06.560\nDid we drive past a sign that said Austin Gateway to Outcast Lovers?\n\n39:06.560 --> 39:09.560\nI don't know how they feel.\n\n39:09.560 --> 39:13.560\nI know how the world feels because it's the fucking number one song forever.\n\n39:13.560 --> 39:14.560\nEveryone loves it.\n\n39:14.560 --> 39:17.560\nAnd a lot of their stuff, and they're always having a great time.\n\n39:17.560 --> 39:19.560\nYou always hear them having a great time in their music.\n\n39:19.560 --> 39:20.560\nThey fucking love outcasts.\n\n39:20.560 --> 39:24.560\nI will take the outcast Hayah song any day of the week\n\n39:24.560 --> 39:27.560\nover anything that Gwen Stefani or No Doubt sings though.\n\n39:27.560 --> 39:28.560\nThat's it.\n\n39:28.560 --> 39:30.560\nToo particular.\n\n39:30.560 --> 39:32.560\nThis guy's too particular.\n\n39:32.560 --> 39:34.560\nAnyways, moving on.\n\n39:34.560 --> 39:35.560\nNext topic.\n\n39:35.560 --> 39:37.560\nWhy am I under fire?\n\n39:37.560 --> 39:38.560\nNo, no, no.\n\n39:38.560 --> 39:40.560\nI wrote down a list because I was a little nervous.\n\n39:40.560 --> 39:42.560\nI wanted to be able to talk to them about stuff.\n\n39:42.560 --> 39:49.560\nThat was like, hey, I was like, I wanted to confront you about Hayah in front of people.\n\n39:49.560 --> 39:53.560\nThere's certain popular bands that people love that I hate.\n\n39:53.560 --> 39:57.560\nAnd I am convinced that if you give me five minutes,\n\n39:57.560 --> 40:04.560\nI can turn the most die-hard Rush fan and convince them that they actually don't like Rush.\n\n40:04.560 --> 40:05.560\nYeah.\n\n40:05.560 --> 40:07.560\nAlright, who's the biggest Rush fan in the audience?\n\n40:07.560 --> 40:08.560\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n40:08.560 --> 40:11.560\nYou don't want the biggest Rush fan in the audience to come up here?\n\n40:11.560 --> 40:12.560\nIs there anybody?\n\n40:12.560 --> 40:14.560\nNo, because now it's been front-loaded.\n\n40:14.560 --> 40:15.560\nOkay.\n\n40:15.560 --> 40:16.560\nYeah, nobody.\n\n40:16.560 --> 40:17.560\nSee how respectful they are?\n\n40:17.560 --> 40:18.560\nAlso, you know what?\n\n40:18.560 --> 40:19.560\nYou know what?\n\n40:19.560 --> 40:22.560\nI don't like Led Zeppelin.\n\n40:22.560 --> 40:25.560\nNo, I hear more applause than booze.\n\n40:25.560 --> 40:26.560\nNo.\n\n40:26.560 --> 40:29.560\nI think it's a great band.\n\n40:29.560 --> 40:33.560\nI love the band, but Robert Plant is a screechy ass.\n\n40:33.560 --> 40:36.560\nAnd when you see film, when you see film of him playing,\n\n40:36.560 --> 40:38.560\nand he's swinging his microphone around,\n\n40:38.560 --> 40:40.560\nand he's stuffing his pants with a sock,\n\n40:40.560 --> 40:42.560\nor maybe he's just got a giant cock.\n\n40:42.560 --> 40:44.560\nIf you have a giant cock and you're wearing those pants,\n\n40:44.560 --> 40:46.560\nthen stop being so insecure and go,\n\n40:46.560 --> 40:52.560\nand looking over at Jimmy Page, he's doing nothing but standing there playing guitar and minding his business.\n\n40:52.560 --> 40:54.560\nAnd every time you see Robert Plant, look over him.\n\n40:54.560 --> 40:55.560\nYou can tell he hates him.\n\n40:55.560 --> 40:57.560\nHe's jealous of the fact that he can do that.\n\n40:57.560 --> 40:59.560\nYou're, because I was confused by your reaction,\n\n40:59.560 --> 41:03.560\nyou are your hardcore Zeppelin to the point where you can be anti-Robert Plant, right?\n\n41:03.560 --> 41:04.560\nYeah.\n\n41:04.560 --> 41:05.560\nYeah, okay, all right.\n\n41:05.560 --> 41:06.560\nThe band is great.\n\n41:06.560 --> 41:08.560\nIt's the best band with the worst singer, I think.\n\n41:08.560 --> 41:09.560\nNot the worst singer.\n\n41:09.560 --> 41:10.560\nThey can do that.\n\n41:10.560 --> 41:11.560\nAll right.\n\n41:11.560 --> 41:12.560\nThis is great.\n\n41:12.560 --> 41:13.560\nAustin, bring them people together.\n\n41:13.560 --> 41:14.560\nFine.\n\n41:14.560 --> 41:19.560\nHe was the hardest booer of it, then.\n\n41:19.560 --> 41:21.560\nI'm going to pour this guy a tea, though.\n\n41:21.560 --> 41:25.560\nCan we get a glass up front for this guy?\n\n41:25.560 --> 41:26.560\nAll right.\n\n41:26.560 --> 41:27.560\nMoving on.\n\n41:27.560 --> 41:28.560\nNext item on my jacket.\n\n41:28.560 --> 41:30.560\nYeah, you thought I was going to die.\n\n41:30.560 --> 41:31.560\nI made friends.\n\n41:31.560 --> 41:32.560\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n41:32.560 --> 41:34.560\nFucking this guy and our lifelong buddies now.\n\n41:34.560 --> 41:37.560\nI wasn't setting you up to be, to suffer anything.\n\n41:37.560 --> 41:38.560\nAll right.\n\n41:38.560 --> 41:41.560\nI wanted to have a relationship with these guys.\n\n41:41.560 --> 41:42.560\nOn the test long control.\n\n41:42.560 --> 41:45.560\nI was only moving forward in doing that.\n\n41:45.560 --> 41:48.560\nJeff and I have been friends for probably,\n\n41:48.560 --> 41:52.560\nI will just round up 15 years today, this morning,\n\n41:52.560 --> 41:55.560\nbecause we've never been on tour ever.\n\n41:55.560 --> 41:58.560\nWe had a special milestone.\n\n41:58.560 --> 41:59.560\nIt's never come up.\n\n41:59.560 --> 42:00.560\nWhy would it ever happen?\n\n42:00.560 --> 42:05.560\nIn an IHOP bathroom, Jeff and I took our first shit together.\n\n42:05.560 --> 42:06.560\nNot together.\n\n42:06.560 --> 42:08.560\nWe went to each other.\n\n42:08.560 --> 42:09.560\nDifferent toilets.\n\n42:09.560 --> 42:10.560\nI've known them forever.\n\n42:10.560 --> 42:12.560\nI came in the bathroom.\n\n42:12.560 --> 42:13.560\nI know he's in there.\n\n42:13.560 --> 42:15.560\nI'm not going to ignore it.\n\n42:15.560 --> 42:17.560\nYou came in and sang a little song.\n\n42:17.560 --> 42:20.560\nBooping in an IHOP bathroom.\n\n42:20.560 --> 42:23.560\nIt's going to make your dreams come true.\n\n42:23.560 --> 42:25.560\nYeah, something like that.\n\n42:25.560 --> 42:31.560\nIt's probably hard to see, but these are Dan's feet under the toilet.\n\n42:31.560 --> 42:35.560\nYeah, it's probably hard to see for some of you.\n\n42:35.560 --> 42:37.560\nHave you seen that enough?\n\n42:37.560 --> 42:40.560\nI know you hate being told your shoes untied, bro.\n\n42:40.560 --> 42:43.560\nI'm not saying that, but your jeans hang down low.\n\n42:43.560 --> 42:45.560\nWhen your jeans are long, you wear them long enough\n\n42:45.560 --> 42:48.560\nto be the little seam, the bead at the end kind of rips off.\n\n42:48.560 --> 42:51.560\nMostly that's just a piss mop that you've got.\n\n42:51.560 --> 42:54.560\nIt's just hanging out right in the kill zone\n\n42:54.560 --> 42:56.560\nunderneath the toilet at an IHOP.\n\n42:56.560 --> 42:59.560\nI guess I just love Texas.\n\n42:59.560 --> 43:03.560\nI trust their germs to be as big as everything else\n\n43:03.560 --> 43:05.560\nand not be able to get into my bloodstream.\n\n43:05.560 --> 43:07.560\nWhat was it called?

Well, we should head to my dad's camp. Yeah, cuz he\n\n58:50.980 --> 58:54.140\nHe's going there to make sure of his camp is safe.

Is it magical?\n\n01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:23.100\nYou've detected magic and you didn't detect magic coming from it, but I open it. That's not very polite. Somebody's journal, man\n\n01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:32.420\nThe first entry reads dead all dead my children gone\n\n01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.380\nFive bright souls snuffed out in an instant\n\n01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:40.020\nNo mother should be forced to endure such horror let alone be forced to watch\n\n01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:46.420\nThere screams their heart-shattering screams the crackling flames the smell of burning flesh\n\n01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:50.220\nI died five times that night and yet I'm still here\n\n01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:55.980\nEven this place is gone. We had a 16 hour bus ride from Phoenix you guys\n\n01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.700\nThat's awesome. I\n\n01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:03.580\nCan't the journal entry ends there Spencer everybody.

Is there a name? There is no name. Hmm\n\n01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:24.220\nWell, I think we should keep this and restore it to it's a huge clue in the mystery of whether or not a bunch of people died here\n\n01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:31.900\nThe book is all the case it may have multiple pages. Oh, oh, I turned the page Jesus\n\n01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:38.900\nIf only I were stronger if only I were male\n\n01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.780\nIf only we're a male the entry ends.

They say it's curse, but I don't know why who wouldn't want this power the entry ends\n\n01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:17.540\nI'm assuming you're flipping through. Yeah. Yeah, the next entry the last entry\n\n01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.980\nIt worked.

No one can trace me back to my roots my past\n\n01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:35.340\nI thought I should change my name to something more masculine to honor their spirits. I came up with Mulraine\n\n01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:43.220\nWell from the elvish word for one who survived great calamity rain\n\n01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.300\nGod's mercy for the rain that should have come to save my children\n\n01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.220\nMy dear children\n\n01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.220\nThat noise again\n\n01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:55.940\nYeah, the coming back noise\n\n01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:03.980\nHello gentlemen, you're reading.

They don't know what switch is I\n\n01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:34.820\nI felt as a strong heat and I I woke up to see my children all all of their\n\n01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.260\nHeads were on fire their hair was on fire\n\n01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.660\nYou should have turned them off\n\n01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:51.900\nHe's so proud of himself so proud of himself\n\n01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:55.340\nAh, Jeff Davis hates a radio lab.

I may be part dragon\n\n01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:41.140\nbut I I would not set on fire and I left the house and I I knew that I would be a\n\n01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:48.940\nterrible mother to another child and I I knew that an arrow would kill whatever was there, so I\n\n01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:52.020\nDivorce yes, what exactly?\n\n01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:04.400\nWell as as as you know most enemies can be defeated by arrows, so I took up the the sport of\n\n01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.740\narrowing\n\n01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:10.300\nThat's the hell fuck half-elf word for it\n\n01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:16.660\nAnd I I and I joined you so you don't know what did this to your people's\n\n01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.660\nI\n\n01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:24.260\nI I don't okay, I I\n\n01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:29.820\nSaw you two traveling and I hoped that I could latch on to you and maybe you would help me\n\n01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.460\nAlso, I've fallen in love with you during this\n\n01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:36.900\nAnd I you\n\n01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.980\nI am so sorry about my gay friend I\n\n01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:44.980\nI\n\n01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:49.900\nLove him too deeply.

Please don't tell him what I said about falling in love with you\n\n01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:10.060\nI I would like to find a belt because I do still possess a sword between my legs and I\n\n01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:14.100\nI'd like to revert to my previous self\n\n01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:26.900\nHey, sorry guys, I was bored to play my loot that Sharpie explained to me really quickly what just happened quark\n\n01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:31.500\nWe we we we really honestly nothing has changed\n\n01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:37.740\nI don't know what we took a long time. I was sitting over there playing my loot for a while\n\n01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:40.220\nWell, I think you should be less mean to\n\n01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.140\nMullbrain\n\n01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:45.140\nAll right, you know\n\n01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.860\nShe's a sensitive person. Okay\n\n01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.940\nAnd this was her home\n\n01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:55.860\nYeah, her children burnt to death. Yeah, I feel pretty bad about that\n\n01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.820\nCame down pretty hard on\n\n01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.260\nSo I can turn and candles off and I'm a little\n\n01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:10.660\nI'm a little overwhelmed, but like I want to avenge the death of your children and I want my dad to be safe\n\n01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:18.380\nI I feel like that the force that destroyed my children is the same that is after your dad\n\n01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:21.380\nIt's a good chance, right? Probably my movie logic\n\n01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:26.260\nMary, you don't see a lot of movies or it's like I have an octopus did this but there's also a werewolf\n\n01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.940\nBut that was as cool as that would be\n\n01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.700\nIt's probably Admiral Darkstar, I guess\n\n01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.300\nWhat a lot of SM3\n\n01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:50.180\nParker in the audience. All right. Well, I think we should proceed toward the bus a lot encampment\n\n01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:55.180\nYeah, where my dad said a long time ago you guys from where right Spencer. We know how to head there\n\n01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:59.740\nOh, yeah, totally. Yeah, well, we do that and end this segment. Yeah, it's over\n\n01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.500\nDungeons and Dragons\n\n01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.340\nHow you like that, Austin?\n\n01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.060\nI think that shit was advanced\n\n01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.740\nEric McGathey is more\n\n01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:22.660\nSpencer and I will be selling merch in the thing. Yeah, and really quick\n\n01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.580\nThis city is the best city in the world\n\n01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:33.780\nI have to agree have to agree. Let's look at some queso after this\n\n01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:41.380\nI would call it the Paris of Texas, but there's some dipshit like Paris of Texas, isn't there?\n\n01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:48.940\nYeah, yeah, but it really is the Paris of Texas. It's the San Francisco of the not the not\n\n01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:51.140\nCalifornia's I don't know\n\n01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:55.300\nCalifornia in Texas we should we should get along we should form an alliance\n\n01:12:55.780 --> 01:13:01.620\nImagine if imagine if we stood up to the whole country and said, you know, let us smoke weed and\n\n01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:08.400\nDon't mess with California either, right\n\n01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.320\nWe'll find we'll find a happy medium on toast size. Yeah\n\n01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:19.080\nBecause really it's little doesn't need to be that's you know, that's got to be all your\n\n01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:26.440\nMaybe we'll make a Nevada toast. Oh, you're all your microchips all of your movies all of your television like we could we could we could take\n\n01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:30.560\nYou know, who needs the rest of the who needs these fuckers that we're going to next\n\n01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.840\nI'll probably find a way to love them when we hit Nashville\n\n01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:42.440\nBut you guys have been amazing. Should we what do we do like are we we're ready to find it?\n\n01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.440\nYou know, we could try and this is you might not like it\n\n01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.760\nbut we have some music here created by Ryan elder who's our musical director and\n\n01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:54.740\nThere's a country song you think maybe you could take what you've gleaned from from this audience tonight\n\n01:13:54.740 --> 01:14:06.740\nYou guys gave us a pretty easy ride that you were working pretty hard last night in Phoenix, but this was a this was like being a nice comfy hammock. So\n\n01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:10.820\nAnd it's it's not like but just not to say that the people in Phoenix made me work harder\n\n01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:15.100\nI I learned you made yourself work. I cut my teeth in Phoenix. Yeah, I punished myself\n\n01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:20.740\nBut it's not like you've gone through a big like like heroic journey tonight where you found out like like you had to you know\n\n01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:24.020\nrise from ashes like a Phoenix and then come back up and\n\n01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:28.380\nLearn to maybe it was just nice and easy and fun all the way through. It's that's it's you know\n\n01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:32.180\nDoesn't make for a great heroic tale, you know, maybe a\n\n01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:36.860\nHow about this maybe sing like a kind of maybe a little sad song or something like that\n\n01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:41.580\nMaybe country style about about you know about having to leave this this beautiful town. We can try it. All right\n\n01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:46.380\nLet's give it a whirl. All right, if not, we bring a Jen Brown up and we sing the peepee poopoo\n\n01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:53.180\nOh, yeah, who knows what we'll just we'll just dive into the audience and root then run for the back door\n\n01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:56.060\nYeah, Jen Jen stay loose. Here we go\n\n01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:04.460\nThe shuffleboard shuffle\n\n01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:14.980\nI left my heart in Texas, but I left my foot in Maine.
