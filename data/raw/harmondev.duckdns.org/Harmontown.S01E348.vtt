{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:27.600\nHello, gang. How's it going? Thank you for coming.\n\n00:30.000 --> 00:37.000\nMy name is Comptroller Jeff Davis and Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:37.000 --> 01:06.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:21.000\nHey, hey, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:32.000\nAnd the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:47.000\nHi. Thanks, folks.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:53.000\nAll right. We got a lot of show for you tonight, so let me get my thoughts out there.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:55.000\nLooking good, Dan.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:58.000\nThanks, buddy. I wasn't fishing for that.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:04.000\nIs that a Hawaiian design on your shirt there, that design?\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:06.000\nThere's a shirt from Tahiti.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:08.000\nCan I see your shirt?\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:09.000\nThank you.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nThat's Tahiti on it.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nLooks Hawaiian.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:14.000\nYeah.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:21.000\nYou guys see this documentary about Michelle Carter, the young lady who was famous a while back.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:29.000\nRemember the big viral story, she encouraged the suicide of her boyfriend through text messages.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:30.000\nRemember that?\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:31.000\nNo.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nCan I watch this documentary?\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:38.000\nI think it's a mini, maybe there's a couple parts, and I can't remember where the hell.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:41.000\nSorry. Just Google it. There's got to be one documentary.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:46.000\nSorry, I should have got my facts straight, but I really recommend it. It's fucking incredible.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:54.000\nIt's mind-blowing to me how you receive the story, and it's like, how many more details could you possibly get?\n\n02:54.000 --> 03:01.000\nYou felt at the time that you got the details, and that's what's click-clickable about stuff is always the gritty details.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:09.000\nBut the documentary kind of reveals that most things probably, if you get all the gritty details,\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:16.000\nwhere it becomes this homogenous paste and what you have is a big fucking pudding of a couple crazy kids,\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:23.000\nneither of which really deserve, I mean, I don't, I personally got to the end of the documentary\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:28.000\nfeeling like, if I was a judge, I wouldn't charge her with anything.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:34.000\nAnd if you haven't watched the documentary, I realize how insane that must sound, which is why you have to watch it,\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:45.000\nbecause we all read the same headlines and news stories, and it's pretty crazy to see how directed your thoughts get\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:52.000\nby the total just impersonal system of click-following.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:55.000\nWhat's selling? What are people going to click on?\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:59.000\nAnd how underneath it, mythically, it really does have to do with,\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:06.000\nlike, there's a journalist in there who kind of lays it down and goes like, this has to do with teenage girls\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:15.000\nand our desire to believe that they're crazy, stupid, psycho, spoiled, you know,\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:22.000\nand we click on that story over and over again, like we have these archetypes that we want to invest in.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nCheck out that documentary.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:29.000\nThe only reason I wrote it down is because I was like, so they have this title sequence,\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:36.000\nit's like one of those fancy HBO show, it's kind of title sequence that's just kind of images,\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:41.000\nand I was like, am I getting older? Am I just finding more stuff in poor taste now?\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:47.000\nThe title sequence is just a smoky interior of a car.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:54.000\nIt's just like smoke and like a gear shift and I'm like, what, don't, what, because the guy killed himself\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nwith the carbon monoxide in his car.\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:05.000\nAnd it's like, so it's like, I was like, smoky car, yeah, I get it, like Mickey Mouse in it,\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:10.000\nyou know, like creatively that's offensive before you even get into psychologically.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:14.000\nAnyways, all right, okay, moving right along, did you know goats?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:19.000\nWe were at a wedding, they had goats at the wedding, or the wedding was at a place that had goats.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nYou know, they got squared.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:26.000\nWait, wait, which wasn't?\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:31.000\nWell, I'm not going to cast any dispersions because both families are from Georgia, so, but no, it was a,\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:32.000\nthey're good, they're good.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:36.000\nWere goats invited to the wedding or this is a wedding that was goat-adjacent?\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nIt was the husband's family.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:42.000\nIt was at this crazy kind of like greenhouse farm in Santa Barbara.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:45.000\nYeah, it was a beautiful remote farm location.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:51.000\nThe actual service was right on this like plane overlooking the beach like you see in like a Hollywood movie\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nof a wedding and we're like, that doesn't happen in real life.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:55.000\nIt was nuts.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:56.000\nDo you see those goats?\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:57.000\nDid you hear, were you there?\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nOh yeah, I'm well acquainted with goat pupils.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:00.000\nContinue.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:01.000\nOh yeah.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nGoat pupils are rectangular.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:04.000\nYes, they are.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:05.000\n90 degree quarters.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:06.000\nYou didn't know this?\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nThey look like panorama thumbnails.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nNo.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:10.000\nBecause they have 330 degrees.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:15.000\nWe've been doing this podcast for seven years and we never, you still don't know that goat\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nrectangles.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:17.000\nYou still don't know this?\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:21.000\nIt's so that goats can have 330 degree vision, which at first you think-\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nThat's hot.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:26.000\nYou're a goat who even cares what's in front of you.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:27.000\nWait, were these goats just-\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:28.000\nThat's exactly the point.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:29.000\nWere these goats just intermittent?\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nWere they wandering about?\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nThey're in a pen.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:38.000\nI hear that goats' legs on one side are shorter than the other.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:39.000\nIs that true?\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:43.000\nBut then you look around and you see all these other animals.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:44.000\nYou see some chickens.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nHe evaded your question, Rob.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:47.000\nYou see how he evaded that?\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:48.000\nI want to get to the truth.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\nAnd you see some cows.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:50.000\nOr I'm just finishing my bet.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nI might be just finishing my bet.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nYou look around and you see some chickens and some cows.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:01.000\nAnd they all got these big round eyes and the goat's like, what did you have for breakfast?\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:02.000\nRectangular.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nYeah, that's why they need them.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:05.000\n330 degree vision.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nWhen's the last time you ate a goat?\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:08.000\nBrother?\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:09.000\nLast week.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nBut you guys had some funny questions about that.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:18.000\nRob says, Rob alleges that half of goat's legs are shorter than the other half.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:21.000\nI think that's maybe there's a certain breed of goats.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nThere's certain subspecies or whatever.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:24.000\nCircle goats.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nUnless that's a myth.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\nYeah, because they're born on the side of mountains.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:31.000\nWhoa.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nI grew up with a goat.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:34.000\nWe had a goat when I was a kid.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nThat's awesome.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:42.000\nAnd then one day our horse fell on the goat and knocked one of the horns out of the goat's head.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:43.000\nHave I told the story before?\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nNo.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nWhat happened?\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:46.000\nThe goat just told you.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:47.000\nShut up.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:48.000\nThe goat.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:49.000\nI'm busy.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nThe goat had one of his horns.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nI think it was his left horn.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nCompletely.\n\n07:54.000 --> 08:00.000\nSteve Levy on the ice machine.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:03.000\nThe horn was not clear out of its head.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:08.000\nAnd then maggots would get into it because now there was a clean path into its brain.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nSure.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:10.000\nWe've talked about this before.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.000\nHow could there not be?\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:12.000\nClean path into its brain.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:17.000\nYeah, and then I would have to trade off with my brother for the shittiest chore of all time\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:22.000\nwas go out with a can of, a spray can of iodine and a spoon.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:23.000\nSure.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nA metal spoon, like a big like.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nYou ever scoop out any brains?\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:31.000\nNo, because I didn't have to get that far in there.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:37.300\nBut I had to go and spray yellow, awful iodine and like headlock a goat and spray iodine\n\n08:37.300 --> 08:41.000\ninto it, which the goat, guess what, didn't like that.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:42.000\nSure.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:45.600\nAnd then I would take the spoon and scrape out the maggots and throw them out and it would\n\n08:45.600 --> 08:51.040\nmake a kind of a scrappy bone sound because we had to do that until the, until the horn\n\n08:51.040 --> 08:56.000\nstarted regrowing and I didn't have to scrape maggots out of a goat face.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nWell, you didn't finish your story.\n\n08:58.000 --> 08:59.000\nHuh?\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nYou didn't finish your story.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nWhat?\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nLong story short, I'm fucking it.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nYou know what I mean?\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nFucking it.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nFucking the brain hole.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:12.000\nSo the end of your bit was chickens and cows have round eyes.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:13.000\nNo, the end of the bit.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:16.000\nAnd you were upset that we didn't know you were doing a bit.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:20.000\nThe end of the bit when he says, what did you have for breakfast?\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:21.000\nUpset?\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nBored?\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:23.000\nYeah.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:29.000\nLike, like, like over it, you know, just like, yeah, I'll finish talking about this.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:30.000\nWhat did you have for breakfast?\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:31.000\nWhat did you have for breakfast?\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:32.000\nThat was the joke.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nYou know what?\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:34.000\nThat's a metaphor for that goat.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:35.000\nLife.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:36.000\nThe rust belt.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nOh, okay.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:38.000\nLost its horn.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nYou know, clear path to its brain.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nOkay.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:43.000\nThrough that wound.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:44.000\nMaggot set in.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nWizard of Oz kind of shit.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\nYeah.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nYeah.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:51.640\nI was, I was just to finish, I was getting to the goat thanked Jeff.\n\n09:51.640 --> 09:52.840\nHe said, thank you.\n\n09:52.840 --> 09:55.000\nYou know, that's like Jeff's stories.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:56.000\nOh, the goat thanked me.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nOh, the goat thanked you.\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:58.000\nThank you.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:03.000\nI just think that, okay, so I was thinking about my dogs today while I was in the pool.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:07.000\nAnd I was, I was, I suddenly thought like, you know, because we put all this to do about\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:13.600\nlike, oh, mankind shaped dogs like development, you know, and like, but then I started to\n\n10:13.600 --> 10:17.000\nthink like, because it was, you know, I've always used the example of like, well, you\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:22.300\nknow, there's a, it's like what we're not saying about that shaping is that the dogs\n\n10:22.300 --> 10:27.000\nthat didn't behave or look the way we liked, you know, they ended up thrown on the campfire.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:31.000\nAnd it was like, like, that's how you like shape an animal that fast and it's just like\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:32.000\nawful eugenics.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:36.600\nBut then I was thinking today, I was like, you know, these dogs, like, because I was\n\n10:36.600 --> 10:41.760\nwatching Harvey's tail and I'm like, he's in a new house and there's a, I've read online\n\n10:41.760 --> 10:45.640\nabout the vocabulary of their tails, you know, there's a whole language to their tails.\n\n10:45.640 --> 10:51.520\nIt's like, it's certain altitudes and angles and then like amounts of rhythms of wagging\n\n10:51.520 --> 10:53.120\nand all this stuff.\n\n10:53.120 --> 10:59.000\nAnd I was like, you know, but there was nothing that I read in the article about dogs tails\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.360\nthat actually surprised me.\n\n11:01.360 --> 11:05.040\nAnd then it made me, I was like, well, yeah, that's kind of a, I already knew that I already,\n\n11:05.040 --> 11:10.160\nI didn't see it written in print, but I knew that the higher the tail this and the slower\n\n11:10.160 --> 11:11.640\nthe tail that and blah, blah, blah.\n\n11:11.640 --> 11:16.080\nAnd then I was thinking today, I'm like, he's not, so I have an inborn sense in me as a\n\n11:16.080 --> 11:24.320\nhomo sapien of like dog tail recognizing just as much as dogs are being born that have this\n\n11:24.320 --> 11:30.120\nsort of innate sense of like, they look at the more expressive side of our face.\n\n11:30.120 --> 11:34.160\nThey don't know they're being born with this, like these predisposed bread into their gene\n\n11:34.160 --> 11:37.880\npool, like a couplings with human behavior.\n\n11:37.880 --> 11:42.160\nAnd I'm starting to think like, well, geez, we're human, you know, don't you think that\n\n11:42.160 --> 11:50.120\nthere's a certain amount to which like only the humans that understood dogs well enough\n\n11:50.120 --> 11:54.680\nsurvived to reproduce with other humans?\n\n11:54.680 --> 11:55.680\nYeah.\n\n11:55.680 --> 12:02.120\nAfter, after a certain point, like if you're just not a dog person, by the way, how many\n\n12:02.120 --> 12:05.000\nnot a dog people are here, homo sapiens?\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nNot a lot.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:11.200\nI mean, some of you don't have dogs, but a lot of people hate cats, I don't get them.\n\n12:11.200 --> 12:16.040\nBut like, like, like, like, how many people are just like, I'm not a dog, dog person.\n\n12:16.040 --> 12:20.080\nLike maybe not a dog owner, because you're scared, you don't want to like, you know,\n\n12:20.080 --> 12:22.000\nengage in this freaky relationship.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:23.000\nI get that.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:28.320\nYou're saying that the humans love of dogs, that that is a, we've been bred out.\n\n12:28.320 --> 12:29.880\nDog haters are gone.\n\n12:29.880 --> 12:32.960\nThey don't, they don't get laid.\n\n12:32.960 --> 12:34.680\nThey might even get mauled to death.\n\n12:34.680 --> 12:37.160\nWe don't know what dead men tell no tales.\n\n12:37.160 --> 12:41.160\nAre there any dog, does anybody here, like, and be honest, and don't just, you know,\n\n12:41.160 --> 12:44.120\ndon't like, lie about it, but like, there's anybody, don't try to be a hero by saying\n\n12:44.120 --> 12:45.120\nyou hate dogs.\n\n12:45.120 --> 12:46.120\nYeah.\n\n12:46.120 --> 12:47.960\nBut does anybody here actually have an aversion to dogs?\n\n12:47.960 --> 12:48.960\nAversion is different.\n\n12:48.960 --> 12:51.760\nI could say though, there's a lot of people with allergies, there's people who could be\n\n12:51.760 --> 12:55.520\nscared of dogs, but there was no applause for that.\n\n12:55.520 --> 12:56.520\nRight.\n\n12:56.520 --> 12:59.080\nI mean, I'm just, yeah, like, like, it really is cliche, but that whole man's best friend\n\n12:59.080 --> 13:00.080\nthing.\n\n13:00.080 --> 13:01.560\nIt's like, geez, there's a two way street happening.\n\n13:01.560 --> 13:05.800\nI just thought today, it was like, holy cow, man, who's walking who, you know, I mean,\n\n13:05.800 --> 13:10.440\nI'm sure we've had a tremendous impact, but like, like, like we, I bet there's a whole\n\n13:10.440 --> 13:18.080\nlike, like, like splinter of humans that don't exist because they couldn't read the tail\n\n13:18.080 --> 13:19.080\nright.\n\n13:19.080 --> 13:20.080\nYou know what I mean?\n\n13:20.080 --> 13:22.640\nWhat does the high tail mean versus the low tail?\n\n13:22.640 --> 13:24.360\nWell, the high tail is just general.\n\n13:24.360 --> 13:25.680\nLike, I mean, what do you think it means?\n\n13:25.680 --> 13:28.960\nWhat do you feel it means in your heart if a dog's got its tail, like, way up in the\n\n13:28.960 --> 13:29.960\nair?\n\n13:29.960 --> 13:30.960\nExcitement.\n\n13:30.960 --> 13:31.960\nYeah.\n\n13:31.960 --> 13:34.240\nI mean, like, well, and, and, and positive excitement, right?\n\n13:34.240 --> 13:40.240\nLike, not just, what, what, what, seems like a clickbait to me, like the article,\n\n13:40.240 --> 13:44.320\nI don't know what your dog's feeling based on tail.\n\n13:44.320 --> 13:46.760\nWhen it's wagging fast, it's happy.\n\n13:46.760 --> 13:47.760\nWhat do you think?\n\n13:47.760 --> 13:48.760\nWhen it's wagging slowly.\n\n13:48.760 --> 13:49.760\nIt's less happy.\n\n13:49.760 --> 13:50.760\nWhat do you think?\n\n13:50.760 --> 13:53.760\nWhat about a dog when its tail is straight?\n\n13:53.760 --> 13:58.040\nLike, like, like if it's a sticking straight out, like a board, right?\n\n13:58.040 --> 14:03.320\nLike, like, totally like a squirrel is in its area when it's down.\n\n14:03.320 --> 14:04.320\nWe all know what that means.\n\n14:04.320 --> 14:07.520\nWe use that expression for ourselves on week.\n\n14:07.520 --> 14:11.200\nAnd then there's a whole language to their barks too, which we also instinctively understand.\n\n14:11.200 --> 14:17.560\nYou test humans, including human non-dog owners, and they all have an innate understanding\n\n14:17.560 --> 14:21.920\nof which types of barks mean there's a person at the door, someone's trying to break into\n\n14:21.920 --> 14:25.800\nmy car, they saw an animal, like humans.\n\n14:25.800 --> 14:30.040\nDo a bark for me and I'm going to, I'm going to give you my, I'm going to give you my honest,\n\n14:30.040 --> 14:34.720\nlike, like, like Rorschach tests, like, like, like you, you give me, can I help?\n\n14:34.720 --> 14:35.720\nYeah.\n\n14:35.720 --> 14:36.720\nYeah, I'm going to help you.\n\n14:36.720 --> 14:39.000\nSo are we doing the barks or are reading the barks?\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\nAre you barking?\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.400\nNo, I'm going to, I'm going to reveal some things I've learned about dog barking by\n\n14:43.400 --> 14:44.400\ntrial.\n\n14:44.400 --> 14:45.760\nI'm going to do, I'm going to do a dog bark.\n\n14:45.760 --> 14:47.240\nHe'll do it and then we'll talk it over.\n\n14:47.240 --> 14:48.240\nYeah.\n\n14:48.240 --> 14:51.440\nYou do a bark and then Schrab and I and Spencer, we're going to, we're going to analyze.\n\n14:51.440 --> 14:52.440\nOkay.\n\n14:52.440 --> 14:54.520\nBut don't look at my face because I'll give it away because I'm human.\n\n14:54.520 --> 14:55.520\nSo like, like, like, yeah.\n\n14:55.520 --> 14:56.520\nOkay.\n\n14:56.520 --> 14:57.520\nEyes closed.\n\n14:57.520 --> 14:58.520\nOkay.\n\n14:58.520 --> 14:59.520\nSo here's dog bark number one.\n\n14:59.520 --> 15:00.520\nYou tell me what this means.\n\n15:00.520 --> 15:01.520\nOkay.\n\n15:01.520 --> 15:03.360\nAnd this is based on an actual bark that you are familiar with.\n\n15:03.360 --> 15:04.360\nI'm not looking at you.\n\n15:04.360 --> 15:09.440\nYeah, and also I heard a thing on a podcast of two that breaks down like what, the vocabulary\n\n15:09.440 --> 15:10.440\nof dog barks.\n\n15:10.440 --> 15:12.080\nLike, what's the bark podcast?\n\n15:12.080 --> 15:13.080\nI can't remember.\n\n15:13.080 --> 15:14.080\nI don't know.\n\n15:14.080 --> 15:15.080\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n15:15.080 --> 15:16.080\nThey didn't do any work.\n\n15:16.080 --> 15:18.080\nThey don't deserve any credit.\n\n15:18.080 --> 15:19.080\nOkay.\n\n15:19.080 --> 15:24.480\nI, I, I, I, I'm not looking at dog number one and tell me, tell me, tell me what this\n\n15:24.480 --> 15:25.480\nmeans.\n\n15:25.480 --> 15:26.480\nOkay.\n\n15:26.480 --> 15:28.440\nSpencer, Schrab and I are going to, going to evaluate your bark.\n\n15:28.440 --> 15:29.440\nOkay.\n\n15:29.440 --> 15:31.880\nGot so much lint on my leg.\n\n15:31.880 --> 15:32.880\nStay focused Schrab.\n\n15:32.880 --> 15:33.880\nOkay.\n\n15:33.880 --> 15:34.880\nOkay.\n\n15:34.880 --> 15:35.880\nI got it.\n\n15:35.880 --> 15:36.880\nI got it.\n\n15:36.880 --> 15:37.880\nI think I got it.\n\n15:37.880 --> 15:38.880\nSpencer, what do you think?\n\n15:38.880 --> 15:39.880\nThat means everything.\n\n15:39.880 --> 15:40.880\nRight?\n\n15:40.880 --> 15:41.880\nWhat you got, Rob?\n\n15:41.880 --> 15:42.880\nI think get up.\n\n15:42.880 --> 15:54.760\nGet, it means get, get out of here.\n\n15:54.760 --> 15:55.760\nGo, go.\n\n15:55.760 --> 15:57.880\nI think that it's a stranger danger.\n\n15:57.880 --> 15:58.880\nYeah.\n\n15:58.880 --> 15:59.880\nYeah.\n\n15:59.880 --> 16:00.880\nYeah.\n\n16:00.880 --> 16:01.880\nOkay.\n\n16:01.880 --> 16:02.880\nSo here's, here's one of the things.\n\n16:02.880 --> 16:03.880\nOkay.\n\n16:03.880 --> 16:04.880\nLet me try one more.\n\n16:04.880 --> 16:05.880\nAnd then we'll bring our guests out.\n\n16:05.880 --> 16:06.880\nOne more.\n\n16:06.880 --> 16:07.880\nNo, we're going to do fucking 30 of these.\n\n16:07.880 --> 16:08.880\nWell, we'll do it.\n\n16:08.880 --> 16:09.880\nWe'll do it with her.\n\n16:09.880 --> 16:10.880\nYeah.\n\n16:10.880 --> 16:11.880\nWe'll bring it.\n\n16:11.880 --> 16:12.880\nOkay.\n\n16:12.880 --> 16:13.880\nUm, she's a, she's a veterinarian.\n\n16:13.880 --> 16:14.880\nYou're going to love her.\n\n16:14.880 --> 16:15.880\nOkay.\n\n16:15.880 --> 16:16.880\nUm, the, uh, here's, here's, here's another, uh, type.\n\n16:16.880 --> 16:17.880\nSo tell me what you think this part.\n\n16:17.880 --> 16:18.880\nCan I look at you this time?\n\n16:18.880 --> 16:19.880\nNo.\n\n16:19.880 --> 16:20.880\nWell, no, I'd rather you didn't.\n\n16:20.880 --> 16:21.880\nOkay.\n\n16:21.880 --> 16:22.880\nOkay.\n\n16:22.880 --> 16:23.880\nOkay.\n\n16:23.880 --> 16:24.880\nOkay.\n\n16:24.880 --> 16:25.880\nI'm going to express with my face.\n\n16:25.880 --> 16:26.880\nLike, I'm going to have towels.\n\n16:26.880 --> 16:27.880\nOkay.\n\n16:27.880 --> 16:28.880\nHere we go.\n\n16:28.880 --> 16:40.880\nDo it one more time.\n\n16:40.880 --> 16:46.880\nCan I have the bark?\n\n16:46.880 --> 16:47.880\nNo, I'm not joking.\n\n16:47.880 --> 16:48.880\nGive it to me.\n\n16:48.880 --> 16:49.880\nI know.\n\n16:49.880 --> 16:50.880\nI know.\n\n16:50.880 --> 16:51.880\nI know.\n\n16:51.880 --> 16:52.880\nI know.\n\n16:52.880 --> 16:53.880\nBecause that, that, that was a lot.\n\n16:53.880 --> 16:54.880\nI think I can do better too.\n\n16:54.880 --> 16:55.880\nThat was a lot.\n\n16:55.880 --> 16:56.880\nYeah.\n\n16:56.880 --> 16:57.880\nCan I have the bark?\n\n16:57.880 --> 16:58.880\nYeah.\n\n16:58.880 --> 16:59.880\nYou just ended up doing Seth Meyers.\n\n16:59.880 --> 17:00.880\nOkay.\n\n17:00.880 --> 17:01.880\nUm, all right.\n\n17:01.880 --> 17:02.880\nAll right.\n\n17:02.880 --> 17:12.880\nIt is just that paint the space.\n\n17:12.880 --> 17:13.880\nYeah.\n\n17:13.880 --> 17:14.880\nYeah.\n\n17:14.880 --> 17:15.880\nYou don't look at my face.\n\n17:15.880 --> 17:16.880\nI will never.\n\n17:16.880 --> 17:17.880\nOkay.\n\n17:17.880 --> 17:22.880\nJust come on.\n\n17:22.880 --> 17:24.880\nThat means war is hell, man.\n\n17:24.880 --> 17:26.880\nThey got Johnny.\n\n17:26.880 --> 17:27.880\nYeah.\n\n17:27.880 --> 17:30.880\nI think that means to stay away from my food.\n\n17:30.880 --> 17:31.880\nYes.\n\n17:31.880 --> 17:32.880\nTo whom?\n\n17:32.880 --> 17:33.880\nTo whom?\n\n17:33.880 --> 17:34.880\nAnother dog.\n\n17:34.880 --> 17:35.880\nYes.\n\n17:35.880 --> 17:38.880\nNow, how does he know that?\n\n17:38.880 --> 17:41.880\nWhat I learned in the podcast is the vocabulary of dogs.\n\n17:41.880 --> 17:45.880\nIt's about sharpness of the bark versus like gravel.\n\n17:45.880 --> 17:46.880\nSo that's it.\n\n17:46.880 --> 17:51.880\nAnd it's about, so they're, um, uh, the more the sharper, uh, the,\n\n17:51.880 --> 17:52.880\nthe barks with more fidelity.\n\n17:52.880 --> 17:55.880\nLike if you looked at them on an oscilloscope, the ones with a\n\n17:55.880 --> 17:59.880\nminute shape to them, that are just punctuated sharp, sharp.\n\n17:59.880 --> 18:03.880\nThey're, they're, they're announcing something, but if there's\n\n18:03.880 --> 18:04.880\nlike more gravel.\n\n18:04.880 --> 18:06.880\nCan I give you a scenario?\n\n18:06.880 --> 18:09.880\nCan I give you a scenario and then you could do a bark?\n\n18:09.880 --> 18:10.880\nOkay.\n\n18:10.880 --> 18:11.880\nOkay.\n\n18:11.880 --> 18:12.880\nOkay.\n\n18:12.880 --> 18:14.880\nMy question is because we have, we have, there's a stranger at\n\n18:14.880 --> 18:15.880\nthe door.\n\n18:15.880 --> 18:16.880\nThat's that right.\n\n18:16.880 --> 18:17.880\nWell, can I do it?\n\n18:17.880 --> 18:18.880\nWait, can I just do third one?\n\n18:18.880 --> 18:19.880\nI want to do a third one.\n\n18:19.880 --> 18:20.880\nCover your eyes.\n\n18:20.880 --> 18:21.880\nCover your eyes.\n\n18:21.880 --> 18:22.880\nEmotionally nuanced one.\n\n18:22.880 --> 18:24.880\nDon't look at me because if you look at me, you'll know what\n\n18:24.880 --> 18:25.880\nit is.\n\n18:25.880 --> 18:26.880\nAnd we'll go back to what I wanted.\n\n18:26.880 --> 18:27.880\nOkay.\n\n18:27.880 --> 18:28.880\nCover.\n\n18:28.880 --> 18:29.880\nYeah.\n\n18:29.880 --> 18:30.880\nAll right.\n\n18:30.880 --> 18:31.880\nOkay.\n\n18:31.880 --> 18:34.880\nIt was a good idea.\n\n18:34.880 --> 18:35.880\nOkay.\n\n18:35.880 --> 18:36.880\nHere it goes.\n\n18:36.880 --> 18:37.880\nHere it goes.\n\n18:37.880 --> 18:38.880\nI'm not looking.\n\n18:38.880 --> 18:39.880\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n18:39.880 --> 18:52.880\nI would say take, try that one more time.\n\n18:52.880 --> 18:53.880\nOkay.\n\n18:53.880 --> 19:06.880\nI think that's a dog that is sleepy and has taken mescalem.\n\n19:06.880 --> 19:09.880\nI see it's a good thing you didn't look at me.\n\n19:09.880 --> 19:13.880\nSee, I think, I think that's like a dog like, like wanting to\n\n19:13.880 --> 19:17.880\nkind of play or whatever, kind of, you know, kind of.\n\n19:17.880 --> 19:23.880\nThere's a dog asking if they had gluten free rolls and then\n\n19:23.880 --> 19:26.880\nrealizing, you know what, it's about the carbs with me.\n\n19:26.880 --> 19:29.880\nI can't pretend it's healthy just because of some fucking\n\n19:29.880 --> 19:30.880\ngluten word I learned yesterday.\n\n19:30.880 --> 19:31.880\nI'm out of here.\n\n19:31.880 --> 19:33.880\nI want to lose weight.\n\n19:33.880 --> 19:34.880\nOur next guest.\n\n19:34.880 --> 19:35.880\nOh yeah.\n\n19:35.880 --> 19:37.880\nWhat was your bit?\n\n19:37.880 --> 19:38.880\nI was good.\n\n19:38.880 --> 19:39.880\nIt's not a bit.\n\n19:39.880 --> 19:43.880\nWhy don't we bring out the guest and have her be a part of this?\n\n19:43.880 --> 19:45.880\nThat could be fun.\n\n19:45.880 --> 19:47.880\nThis is absolutely steamroll.\n\n19:47.880 --> 19:50.880\nThis important inquiry that we're doing right now.\n\n19:50.880 --> 19:51.880\nOkay.\n\n19:51.880 --> 19:53.880\nOur next guest has already been a guest very recently too.\n\n19:53.880 --> 19:54.880\nI just like her.\n\n19:54.880 --> 19:55.880\nI thought we'd have her back.\n\n19:55.880 --> 20:14.880\nLet's have Heather Anne Campbell come out.\n\n20:14.880 --> 20:15.880\nHello, Heather Anne

--> 20:55.880\nAnd I wanted to hear what the dog.\n\n20:55.880 --> 20:56.880\nHeather, are you a dog owner?\n\n20:56.880 --> 20:57.880\nJesus Christ.\n\n20:57.880 --> 21:02.880\nI just want to talk it five times in a row with this shit.\n\n21:02.880 --> 21:04.880\nHeather, are you a dog aficionado?\n\n21:04.880 --> 21:05.880\nAre you a dog lover?\n\n21:05.880 --> 21:06.880\nDog Liker.\n\n21:06.880 --> 21:07.880\nDo you have a dog?\n\n21:07.880 --> 21:08.880\nI'm not doing it now.\n\n21:08.880 --> 21:09.880\nNo, I'm not.\n\n21:09.880 --> 21:10.880\nNo, I'm not.\n\n21:10.880 --> 21:17.620\nI want to bring our guest into the fold here Schrab. No, I feel like I feel like he had something you needed to say\n\n21:17.620 --> 21:22.300\nSo if you if you have something I'll I can take we can take a moment and I'll answer\n\n21:22.300 --> 21:27.580\nOh, we can come back to that. I only ask I like are you a dog person? Is this okay if I answer this?\n\n21:28.140 --> 21:30.140\nYes, okay great\n\n21:30.220 --> 21:37.020\nSo I do I'm taking yes. I I co-own a dog with my girlfriend. Okay. It's primarily her dog\n\n21:37.020 --> 21:43.200\nBut now it is also my dog fantastic. So you're qualified to weigh in on this dog. Yes inquiry that we are engaging\n\n21:44.320 --> 21:51.620\nIt is a it is a Maltese and it's completely wall-eyed and it just came we just found out it as Cushing's disease\n\n21:53.060 --> 21:56.360\nWhat does that mean? That's where it plays grandma of Tarkin and Star Wars\n\n21:56.360 --> 22:07.480\nIf you want to see an unearned mug\n\n22:08.680 --> 22:11.960\nFive dollars a month five dollars a month while it lasts\n\n22:15.960 --> 22:19.960\nWhat is Cushing's disease? I hope it's not serious. I hope it's adorable. Well, no\n\n22:19.960 --> 22:26.580\nUh, it thinks hot dogs are socks. Come on Cushing. That would be it would be it's not a it\n\n22:26.880 --> 22:32.640\nIt has a tumor on either. It's it's it's pituitary or adrenal glands\n\n22:32.640 --> 22:40.440\nWhich a release a bunch of cortisol into its blood, which is the stress hormone. So the dog is totally stressed out all the time\n\n22:40.440 --> 22:50.480\nAnd yet you find it delightful if you knew how dumb the dog looked\n\n22:52.400 --> 22:56.640\nBut there it's on medicine and hopefully it's treat it's totally treatable\n\n22:56.640 --> 23:00.520\nIt's just not the most ideal way for a dog to live, but it's gonna be okay\n\n23:01.240 --> 23:07.460\nIs that a disease that exists in humans or just in dogs? I I I don't know. I don't know\n\n23:07.460 --> 23:14.000\nI'm not a yes. Yes Cushing's disease affects human beings and dogs. It is transferable from one to the other\n\n23:15.920 --> 23:18.520\nOkay, great. I got a woo. So that's correct\n\n23:19.920 --> 23:25.520\nAll right, so say I said all right Schrab. What was your thing gonna be just totally okay?\n\n23:25.520 --> 23:28.080\nSo I was just gonna say you're working on anything Heather\n\n23:28.080 --> 23:33.680\nYeah, I got one\n\n23:41.160 --> 23:43.320\nThis is what you're like to other people\n\n23:46.080 --> 23:50.360\nThat's true very true very true I\n\n23:50.360 --> 23:58.520\nWas gonna say like I want to give you a scenario I want to hear what the dog bark with\n\n23:58.880 --> 24:02.440\nOkay, and do we need to close our eyes while you do this right now?\n\n24:04.280 --> 24:08.760\nYou're gonna know yeah, exactly so okay\n\n24:09.800 --> 24:14.760\nPay attention to me to the owner like pay attention like pay attention\n\n24:15.400 --> 24:17.980\nYou want to hear what that bark sounds like?

Yeah, you're the dog\n\n24:21.660 --> 24:25.720\nAnd I'm like I'm like I'm my phone or I'm reading a book\n\n24:25.720 --> 24:40.440\nSo get get try to really get my attention, okay, okay for real right\n\n24:40.440 --> 24:42.440\nOh\n\n24:54.880 --> 24:56.880\nNo\n\n25:02.960 --> 25:04.960\nStop it\n\n25:04.960 --> 25:11.760\nWell, yeah, I nailed it. I just wanted that to go on for an hour. Yeah\n\n25:13.900 --> 25:15.900\nI\n\n25:16.380 --> 25:22.160\nYou're the dog and you're trying to express to Rob your owner or Heather\n\n25:23.980 --> 25:25.980\nThat\n\n25:25.980 --> 25:44.600\nYou haven't been walked in a while and it's time to go romp and play. I'll do it Harvey does\n\n25:48.780 --> 25:50.780\nHe does these like chew back of like\n\n25:50.780 --> 25:55.680\nLike utterances that are like human. It's like he's trying to talk like a person\n\n25:56.520 --> 26:02.000\nHeather, what's your dog's name Brooklyn Brooklyn Brooklyn my dog lolly?\n\n26:04.460 --> 26:10.880\nSneezes okay when she wants to be paid attention to like if I'm in bed too long in the morning she'll go\n\n26:10.880 --> 26:17.500\nDoes this Brooklyn do anything\n\n26:19.820 --> 26:21.820\nBrooklyn's too stressed out man\n\n26:21.860 --> 26:23.860\nYeah, I'm curious what is\n\n26:24.020 --> 26:31.180\nBrooklyn is like for the last few months while she's been coming down with this has been perpetually laid out in the middle of the room\n\n26:31.180 --> 26:40.980\nArms flat like belly flat on the ground arms spread out like the world is moving too quickly\n\n26:40.980 --> 26:47.560\nYeah, like a bear rug. Yeah, but uh, yeah, I think I read that\n\n26:48.020 --> 26:55.100\nSneezing in a dog means I'm not a threat like they'll sneeze when they play with each other to remind each other that they're not a threat\n\n26:55.100 --> 27:00.660\nI think she's I thought there was I thought my house was dirty. I got it. I like they're constantly\n\n27:01.420 --> 27:07.280\nYou know like yeah together they do I'm like Jesus Christ. What's wrong with my house?\n\n27:07.680 --> 27:09.640\nWell, they do it to each other. Well, yeah\n\n27:09.640 --> 27:14.180\nThey kind of like both like like especially if they've been laying around all day\n\n27:14.180 --> 27:18.700\nAnd then they kind of like start getting up and getting frisky, and then it's like\n\n27:18.700 --> 27:26.760\nLike they start sneezing all over the place. I think that means I'm not a threat. We're playing. I think I read that somewhere\n\n27:27.300 --> 27:31.540\nWhat does it mean that Nigel just fucks the hell out of Harvey like I?\n\n27:32.340 --> 27:35.060\nThink I know I think it's just like anxiety\n\n27:35.740 --> 27:40.260\nLike it says like like like because he Nigel can't win a game of fetch with Harvey\n\n27:40.260 --> 27:44.020\nSo he's just learned now that's what I do that if he lets Harvey get the ball Harvey\n\n27:44.020 --> 27:48.900\nI'll eventually get so tired he has to lay down and like chew his ball and try to keep someone for taking it\n\n27:48.900 --> 27:53.340\nAnd then Nigel's just like like climbs up by him and just rails him for\n\n27:54.100 --> 28:00.940\nUntil what until nothing he's a fixed dog like I don't it's can't be anything but pure just like comfort for him\n\n28:00.940 --> 28:02.620\nWhat is Harvey's like?\n\n28:02.620 --> 28:09.100\nWhat is the look on Harvey's face like Harvey just acts like either Harvey like acts like he paid for it like\n\n28:09.980 --> 28:11.980\nlike he's like yeah\n\n28:11.980 --> 28:14.460\nBut but like not like oh, yeah\n\n28:14.460 --> 28:20.780\nBut I can't tell if Harvey's ignoring it if he's conscious of it because heart Nigel's not really getting anywhere near\n\n28:21.460 --> 28:23.140\nHis actual\n\n28:23.140 --> 28:29.900\nOpening I mean Harvey's the size of a skyscraper compared to him. So he's just like rubbing his Harvey never has a very complicated\n\n28:29.900 --> 28:36.940\nLook in his eyes. He's a pretty simple. Yeah, but Nigel just like his legs are so much shorter\n\n28:36.940 --> 28:45.700\nSo it's just like he just lays his front legs on Harvey like like but they just they don't touch the ground\n\n28:45.700 --> 28:52.220\nHe just like like gets on his back and he puts both paws on either side of him and lays his chin down across\n\n28:52.580 --> 28:54.580\nHarvey's back and just\n\n28:55.620 --> 28:57.940\nFor five dollars a month you can see\n\n28:57.940 --> 29:05.060\nBut I don't know if I'm supposed to stop them. Do you know anything about this? I'm not asking cuz you're gay. I don't\n\n29:07.420 --> 29:09.420\nAsking cuz you're a dog owner\n\n29:10.060 --> 29:16.980\nYeah, well, I mean okay, you know, it's supposed to stop. It's like sleepwalking. Is there anything like like this?\n\n29:17.660 --> 29:24.700\nI can't stop them. I think humans have a hair trigger for this domination talk when we think about dogs and how they interact with each other\n\n29:24.700 --> 29:33.300\nLike I did what I've learned from modern dog books is that we we we go to that word too much for it to explain their behavior\n\n29:33.300 --> 29:36.540\nMy dog fucks where the food comes out of\n\n29:37.340 --> 29:38.860\nlike it\n\n29:38.860 --> 29:44.940\nIt has a it has a toy that delivers treats and after the treats have come out of the toy\n\n29:45.340 --> 29:47.340\nIt fucks the toy\n\n29:48.060 --> 29:51.500\nSo I don't know that it's dominance. I think I think it's I\n\n29:51.500 --> 29:59.100\nThink I think you're right because lolly has we got we got her a big stuffed animal\n\n29:59.420 --> 30:06.860\nActually, it was Kate stuffed animal became lollies after we came home and caught her fucking the hell out of it\n\n30:06.860 --> 30:08.860\nAnd she was just like\n\n30:10.660 --> 30:12.660\nI was like, okay, well now it's yours\n\n30:13.260 --> 30:15.180\nNot gonna hang out with that anymore\n\n30:15.180 --> 30:21.620\nBut but she'll like grab it and toss it around and flip it in the air and just like roll around on it and then\n\n30:22.340 --> 30:28.060\nFinish with a good old. Yeah, bonus. Yeah, same. Yeah, and my dog is a female dog\n\n30:28.060 --> 30:34.820\nSo I don't so it's just fun. Yeah, I think I think if you want what I've learned is that when it's doing when she's\n\n30:35.020 --> 30:39.620\nFucking her toy if I say good girl, she'll look at me and stop\n\n30:39.620 --> 30:45.300\nLike because of the screw. That's a normal reaction. Yeah, well, I think I\n\n30:46.380 --> 30:51.020\nThink I think she comes to and it's like, what am I doing?\n\n30:55.700 --> 30:58.340\nI mean, she's good at fucking where the food comes out\n\n30:58.340 --> 31:04.540\nI wonder if it feels good at all and if it does if that's not incredibly frustrating because it can't achieve\n\n31:04.540 --> 31:11.380\nThe culmination do female dogs do like a hump like like like they actually do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay\n\n31:11.380 --> 31:15.900\nSo there's a here's a here's something that Lollie does after she takes a shit\n\n31:15.900 --> 31:19.180\nSo she'll take a shit and then she'll like\n\n31:19.700 --> 31:26.020\nKick grass and dirt up and miss and all over the place like not even touching the shit\n\n31:26.020 --> 31:28.980\nShe'll kick it on my face kick it on my arms kick it on the house\n\n31:29.060 --> 31:31.580\nWhatever it's all over the place misses it now\n\n31:31.580 --> 31:35.940\nI know she's trying what she's probably trying to do trying to cover up the shit\n\n31:36.620 --> 31:42.580\nSo no other animals come around and go. Oh, there's shit here. I'm gonna have a little dog to eat later\n\n31:42.580 --> 31:44.580\nThat's what I'm thinking\n\n31:45.820 --> 31:47.900\nBut it's like hard wire to your brain\n\n31:47.900 --> 31:54.220\nI mean, I bet you're right, but boy, what a what an innocent time that must have been in the biosphere\n\n31:54.300 --> 32:01.020\nWhere you could just window shop for feces. Hmm. Hmm smells like a rabbit's been around here\n\n32:01.020 --> 32:04.780\nI think I'll just set up camp and wait for it to come back take another shit\n\n32:04.780 --> 32:07.740\nWell, they probably do because they go, oh a rabbit eats a lot of grass\n\n32:07.740 --> 32:11.460\nSo it's like oh, I'm gonna go after that thing and if you smell like I\n\n32:12.060 --> 32:14.060\nKnow but cut to this blade runner\n\n32:14.300 --> 32:19.380\nLandscape of flaming smokes tax, but the animals are still doing the same things\n\n32:19.380 --> 32:23.500\nBut it's like oh better bury that shit leste fucking jackalope\n\n32:24.420 --> 32:27.780\nPray on me by smelling it. It's like you ain't got nothing to worry about\n\n32:27.780 --> 32:33.060\nHere's another thing flies why flies fly away when you go they're on the shit\n\n32:33.580 --> 32:36.820\nYou walk up to the turd and the flies get they go run\n\n32:37.940 --> 32:39.940\nYou're fine\n\n32:39.940 --> 32:59.340\nI wasn't gonna do anything you're fine. I'm not gonna take it away. I'm not gonna swat you\n\n32:59.340 --> 33:05.900\nBut here's the thing here's my question to the room. So so my dog is really bad\n\n33:05.900 --> 33:12.140\nI'm covering up her own shit. I don't think she knows why she does it. She just knows I'm taking a shit\n\n33:12.140 --> 33:16.340\nI got to do this thing. It's in my hand. So she's doing it wrong and\n\n33:16.820 --> 33:20.420\nAnd I wish I could say hey you miss you're missing it\n\n33:20.420 --> 33:25.820\nJust if you're gonna do it do it right or whatever, but my question is what are we as human beings?\n\n33:26.620 --> 33:34.380\nDoing naturally right but completely wrong, you know, like if like the next evolutionary stage look down on what oh jeez\n\n33:34.380 --> 33:40.500\nWhy are you you you're obviously doing that to do this, but you're doing it so well\n\n33:40.500 --> 33:46.660\nI'll tell you my vote here. We go lying. I think I think we're gonna look back. Well, maybe now we but like\n\n33:47.220 --> 33:52.580\nThe next stage of our evolution. We're gonna be like holy shit people just kept lying\n\n33:52.740 --> 33:57.780\nIt was like insane. It was killing them.

Here's your medal for not trying\n\n36:27.940 --> 36:29.940\nWhat\n\n36:33.780 --> 36:35.780\nHudson Hawk tries yes\n\n36:39.140 --> 36:44.580\nI I show the movie to friends once a year I make people watching on my birthday sometimes\n\n36:44.580 --> 36:52.540\nThat's Xanadu Xanadu Xanadu is a fucking freak out. It's not a great movie, and yet I'm fascinated by it\n\n36:52.540 --> 36:58.540\nYep, is Xanadu the one with the leather X that Connery wears? No, that's Zardos\n\n36:59.940 --> 37:01.940\nZardos is fucking a bummer\n\n37:02.460 --> 37:07.180\nZardos I want to like Zardos, but that movie does not want you to like it. No\n\n37:07.180 --> 37:14.220\nZardos asks you to hate that movie. Yeah, because there's only so much Sean Connery wearing\n\n37:15.780 --> 37:20.900\nUnderpants and high leather boots. I know I already mentioned this and I can't remember the director's name\n\n37:20.900 --> 37:26.740\nBut the director's commentary for Zardos does begin with the director saying hello. I'm so and so I directed Zardos\n\n37:26.740 --> 37:38.180\nI'll be the first to admit it kind of got away from me. Let's proceed\n\n37:38.180 --> 37:45.540\nWow, I mean the thing is the movie starts off the movie was was the Rick and Morty episode I show me what you got\n\n37:45.540 --> 37:47.540\nWell, that was that was a Zardos riff, right?\n\n37:49.060 --> 37:51.060\nThe giant\n\n37:51.060 --> 37:58.940\nYeah, the drop-in-loads heads that are on the Gazorpazort planet with that that give all the sex dolls to the to the male\n\n37:59.220 --> 38:02.820\nPopulation the surface dollars those heads are definitely Zardos heads\n\n38:03.540 --> 38:09.700\nBut they also are supposed they look a little bit like Nick Manning the porn star and they drop loads and say dropping loads\n\n38:10.100 --> 38:12.900\nWhat happened to Nick Manning? He disappeared\n\n38:13.540 --> 38:15.540\nHe was in a Batman\n\n38:15.540 --> 38:17.140\nporn parody\n\n38:17.140 --> 38:21.620\nYeah, what year he's gone. He's his load just dropped off the face of the earth\n\n38:22.020 --> 38:24.180\nWho? Well, who are you talking about?\n\n38:24.180 --> 38:26.180\nDo you know Nick Manning?\n\n38:27.220 --> 38:29.220\nNo, it's the it's the younger\n\n38:29.460 --> 38:37.100\nIt's the guy you don't think there's a guy that every time he comes in a porno. He says dropping loads. I didn't I'm happily unfamiliar with that\n\n38:39.100 --> 38:41.940\nIt's like it's like he was he was on stern a lot\n\n38:41.940 --> 38:47.860\nLike the stern was fascinated with it because he was the first porn star that I know of that if you're like all these decades of\n\n38:48.260 --> 38:54.340\nOf of porn movies like finally one male porn star just decided how about every time I come?\n\n38:54.420 --> 39:00.740\nI say the same thing no matter what movie I'm in no one can fire me. I just came drop and load\n\n39:01.540 --> 39:05.140\nHe's in the batman one. He says\n\n39:05.940 --> 39:07.940\ndropping bat loads\n\n39:08.180 --> 39:10.180\nI mean\n\n39:10.180 --> 39:13.300\nI think that might have been his shark\n\n39:13.940 --> 39:20.260\nNick Manning if if you're out there and you're in trouble like come tell us about it. Why is he dropping him?\n\n39:20.580 --> 39:22.580\nDropping is so funny\n\n39:25.620 --> 39:32.820\nI know because it's not I mean it somebody I've ever read an article about like there you won't you won't see a lot of\n\n39:33.780 --> 39:35.780\nmale porn star names\n\n39:35.780 --> 39:39.460\nThey they don't tend to go for like the dick\n\n39:40.180 --> 39:46.660\nHard-on like they don't they try to they steer they steer clear of like kind of like overtly\n\n39:48.500 --> 39:50.500\nkind of like\n\n39:50.740 --> 39:55.300\nevocations of erectness and impenetrability and things like that and and\n\n39:55.860 --> 39:58.100\nI there's some psychological reason for that\n\n39:58.740 --> 40:04.100\nLike like and and by the same token. That's probably why his catchphrase isn't like shooting lasers\n\n40:04.100 --> 40:11.060\nYou know, it's just dropping loads. It's like is it you want to throw it away? You don't want to look what I do\n\n40:11.060 --> 40:13.860\nI fuck for a living. I don't fuck. I'm not I'm not flash Gordon\n\n40:15.220 --> 40:21.620\nDropping loads.

That's the grossest lyric of all. Hey\n\n40:55.060 --> 40:57.700\nHey Eagles, stop loosening your load.\n\n40:57.700 --> 41:00.300\nYou know, I've never come what I would call a load.\n\n41:00.300 --> 41:01.140\nHuh?\n\n41:01.140 -->

--> 42:28.780\nBrexit.\n\n42:28.780 --> 42:29.620\nHuh?\n\n42:29.620 --> 42:30.460\nBrexit.\n\n42:30.460 --> 42:31.300\nBrexit.\n\n42:31.300 --> 42:36.300\nNo, I don't know what the official reason\n\n42:39.900 --> 42:43.420\nthat was put out was, but my co-host fell ill\n\n42:43.420 --> 42:46.660\nso we can't go and I hope he gets better.\n\n42:46.660 --> 42:49.500\nBut I was super

reason\n\n43:06.540 --> 43:08.380\nwhy that had to be a secret and now he's fucked.\n\n43:08.380 --> 43:11.460\nI think it was, the thing was that he,\n\n43:11.460 --> 43:13.900\nI don't think he wanted, you know,\n\n43:13.900 --> 43:16.660\nhe didn't want to take all the ire for it,\n\n43:16.660 --> 43:18.140\nbut I just did that, so.\n\n43:18.140 --> 43:21.580\nOh, I see, he didn't want it to be because of him.\n\n43:21.580 --> 43:25.660\nYeah, yeah, but now, you know, now they know.\n\n43:25.660 --> 43:26.500\nIt was Nick.\n\n43:26.500 --> 43:28.740\nHave you been having fun playing a bad video game?\n\n43:28.740 --> 43:32.660\nThat show is fun when we're recording\n\n43:32.660 --> 43:35.020\nand it's really miserable the rest of the time.\n\n43:35.020 --> 43:36.300\nBecause you're having a research.\n\n43:36.300 --> 43:38.220\nYeah, so I play, on Sundays,\n\n43:38.220 --> 43:41.780\nI play like maybe four, five to eight hours\n\n43:41.780 --> 43:44.980\nof a terrible video game and that's my schedule,\n\n43:44.980 --> 43:47.940\nmy scheduled time to do the thing for the podcast\n\n43:47.940 --> 43:51.300\nand take a bunch of notes and I've had to give up\n\n43:51.300 -->

fun.\n\n43:59.620 --> 44:01.340\nWe thought it would be.\n\n44:01.340 --> 44:04.060\nAnd then our first episode in, after the tape,\n\n44:04.060 --> 44:07.300\nNick was like, I think we have miscalculated.\n\n44:09.300 --> 44:10.660\nHow do you pick the games?\n\n44:10.660 --> 44:13.300\nYou seek out games you know are going to be bad?\n\n44:13.300 --> 44:16.660\nYeah, so either like via, if there's like a theme,\n\n44:16.660 --> 44:18.540\nthen it'll be like a Metacritic,\n\n44:18.540 --> 44:21.980\nlike what's the worst game in this genre?\n\n44:21.980 --> 44:25.020\nToday was, the

there was a microphone that you snapped\n\n45:28.260 --> 45:29.980\ninto the controller and the only way to interact\n\n45:29.980 --> 45:31.340\nwith the game was to talk to it.\n\n45:31.340 --> 45:33.060\nNo, not the only way.\n\n45:33.060 --> 45:33.900\nYeah.\n\n45:33.900 --> 45:34.940\nLike go left, go right.\n\n45:34.940 --> 45:36.260\nYou can't, there is no go left.\n\n45:36.260 --> 45:37.420\nThere's only talking to Seaman.\n\n45:37.420 --> 45:39.020\nThere's only talking.\n\n45:39.020 --> 45:40.060\nIt fucking sucks.\n\n45:40.060 --> 45:42.060\nI'm telling you, it fucking blows.\n\n45:42.060 --> 45:43.380\nBecause it's Dreamcast.\n\n45:43.380 --> 45:44.820\nWhat year is this from?\n\n45:44.820 --> 45:47.260\nLike 2000, 1999, somewhere in there.\n\n45:47.260 --> 45:48.460\nAnd you have to talk to it and say,\n\n45:48.460 --> 45:49.300\ngo here or go there?\n\n45:49.300 --> 45:50.260\nNo, you just talked.\n\n45:50.260 --> 45:51.100\nNo.\n\n45:51.100 --> 45:51.940\nIt doesn't go anywhere.\n\n45:51.940 --> 45:52.780\nIt doesn't go anywhere.\n\n45:52.780 --> 45:53.620\nYou just have breakfast?\n\n45:53.620 --> 45:54.460\nWhat is it?\n\n45:54.460 --> 45:55.300\nIt grows up.\n\n45:55.300 --> 45:57.020\nIt grows up and then you talk to it\n\n45:57.020 --> 45:59.580\nand asks you questions and remembers your answers.\n\n45:59.580 --> 46:00.420\nAnd then it-\n\n46:00.420 --> 46:01.940\nWhy is he Seaman?\n\n46:01.940 --> 46:02.900\nBecause he's a fish.\n\n46:02.900 --> 46:07.380\nFish with a human face, a bald man's face.\n\n46:07.380 --> 46:08.220\nPretty unattractive.\n\n46:08.220 --> 46:10.020\nI'm telling you, the show is a nightmare.\n\n46:11.520 --> 46:13.700\nA grown ass man?\n\n46:13.700 --> 46:17.540\nYeah, a grown human man's face and the fish body.\n\n46:17.540 --> 46:20.340\nAnd it's like a baby though with a grown man's face.\n\n46:20.340 --> 46:22.580\nWhat style of animation or like-\n\n46:22.580 --> 46:23.420\nWhat?\n\n46:23.420 --> 46:24.740\nWait, what?\n\n46:24.740 --> 46:26.740\nWhat are the visuals like on this?\n\n46:26.740 --> 46:27.580\nLike what does it look like?\n\n46:27.580 --> 46:30.300\nSo it's like you're looking at a fish tank\n\n46:30.300 --> 46:32.740\nand in the fish tank is a fish with a human face.\n\n46:32.740 --> 46:33.860\nWas it the 3D kind of thing?\n\n46:33.860 --> 46:34.700\nOr is it the 3D?\n\n46:34.700 --> 46:36.620\nNo, it's PS1 graphics, PS2.\n\n46:36.620 --> 46:37.660\nIt's PS2 era.\n\n46:37.660 --> 46:40.300\nI love that there has to be a tank in the video game\n\n46:40.300 --> 46:42.700\nto keep the fish from escaping.\n\n46:42.700 --> 46:43.580\nThe video game.\n\n46:43.580 --> 46:44.660\nWell, it's-\n\n46:44.660 --> 46:47.300\nAnd so is there an end game where you just interact\n\n46:47.300 --> 46:48.140\nwith this fish?\n\n46:48.140 --> 46:49.940\nYou interact with it until it becomes an adult\n\n46:49.940 --> 46:51.020\nand then it goes away.\n\n46:54.300 --> 46:56.220\nIt's a metaphor for childbirth.\n\n46:56.220 --> 47:00.500\nWait, it goes away and then it scrolls credits?\n\n47:00.500 --> 47:01.340\nYeah.\n\n47:01.340 --> 47:02.180\nYes.\n\n47:02.180 --> 47:03.020\nYou start the game over.\n\n47:03.020 --> 47:04.460\nYes, that's for real.\n\n47:04.460 --> 47:05.420\nThat's for real.\n\n47:05.420 --> 47:08.340\nAnd Thanksgiving comes back with a horrible girlfriend.\n\n47:08.340 --> 47:11.580\nIt's a polysine major.\n\n47:11.580 --> 47:15.860\nIt's just problematizing every fucking thing in the table.\n\n47:15.860 --> 47:17.540\nDoes the fish talk back to you?\n\n47:17.540 --> 47:18.380\nYes.\n\n47:18.380 --> 47:21.900\nAnd what does it sound like?\n\n47:21.900 --> 47:22.860\nIt's like-\n\n47:22.860 --> 47:23.700\nDavid Press.\n\n47:23.700 --> 47:25.900\nIt's like here, I'll do my best impression.\n\n47:25.900 --> 47:32.900\nIt's like, so how are you doing today?\n\n47:32.900 --> 47:34.620\nOh.\n\n47:34.620 --> 47:40.020\nI'm asking you, like that, it's got a fucking attitude.\n\n47:40.020 --> 47:41.900\nAnd do you have, is it like Sims?\n\n47:41.900 --> 47:44.620\nIf you don't talk to it, it dies or do you have to-\n\n47:44.620 --> 47:47.620\nIf you don't talk to it, it gets stupid.\n\n47:47.620 --> 47:50.100\nSo what winning is it going away?\n\n47:50.100 --> 47:52.180\nI guess it's like-\n\n47:52.180 --> 47:55.020\nI would imagine losing is it just stays\n\n47:55.020 --> 47:57.980\non eventually mass shoots and blames you in its letter.\n\n48:01.580 --> 48:03.900\nToo soon?\n\n48:03.900 --> 48:07.660\nThere's one a week for the last 10 years.\n\n48:07.660 --> 48:10.700\nI tried, when I was playing it for the show,\n\n48:10.700 --> 48:13.940\nI found a list of all the words that it recognized.\n\n48:13.940 --> 48:16.780\nAnd I just was reading the list to it\n\n48:16.780 --> 48:18.980\nto try and hack its intelligence to make it\n\n48:18.980 --> 48:21.580\nlike as smart as possible right away.\n\n48:21.580 --> 48:26.860\nAnd that was not satisfying for either of us.\n\n48:26.860 --> 48:28.740\nIt's the worst way to play a bad game.\n\n48:28.740 --> 48:31.140\nHow does Seaman let you know that he's\n\n48:31.140 --> 48:35.300\nunsatisfied with your course of action?\n\n48:35.300 --> 48:39.260\nBecause he really is irritated all the time.\n\n48:39.260 --> 48:41.500\nLike it's not a pleasant experience.\n\n48:41.500 --> 48:43.620\nSo I'm picturing the most uncomfortable thing.\n\n48:43.620 --> 48:45.940\nI'm having anxiety right now just thinking about it.\n\n48:45.940 --> 48:49.340\nI'm picturing a grown man's head.\n\n48:49.340 --> 48:50.940\nThat's right, body.\n\n48:50.940 --> 48:53.740\nThat's like- it sounds like a David Lynch movie.\n\n48:53.740 --> 48:56.540\nIf I go on my phone right now and type in Seaman,\n\n48:56.540 --> 48:57.540\nwill I find Seaman?\n\n48:57.540 --> 49:00.300\nYeah, yeah.\n\n49:00.300 --> 49:04.380\nIt's giving me flashbacks to this potentially traumatizing\n\n49:04.380 --> 49:06.540\nmemory I had when I visited my sister's hospital.\n\n49:06.540 --> 49:10.540\nAnd I believe I shared on this podcast.\n\n49:10.540 --> 49:12.420\nAnd I went and I remember going wandering around\n\n49:12.420 --> 49:13.340\nmy sister's hospital.\n\n49:13.340 --> 49:15.340\nShe was institutionalized for Rhett Syndrome.\n\n49:15.340 --> 49:19.740\nAnd it was a big state-funded building.\n\n49:19.740 --> 49:22.420\nOh, it's so much worse than I thought.\n\n49:22.420 --> 49:23.860\nThis is really gross.\n\n49:23.860 --> 49:26.420\nAnd I happened to find this grown man in a crib.\n\n49:26.420 --> 49:27.380\nI was like eight years old.\n\n49:27.380 --> 49:29.180\nI'm peering into a crib because I just\n\n49:29.180 --> 49:32.540\nhear this sound of a guy going, moo, moo, moo, moo.\n\n49:32.540 --> 49:35.980\nAnd then I looked in and it was just a grown-ass man\n\n49:35.980 --> 49:40.260\nwith a mustache and a hot comb to like quaffed haircut.\n\n49:40.260 --> 49:43.500\nLike somebody would come by and take real good care of him.\n\n49:43.500 --> 49:45.540\nLike he looked like a handsome movie actor,\n\n49:45.540 --> 49:46.820\nbut he was in a diaper.\n\n49:46.820 --> 49:50.660\nAnd he was calling out for his squeaky cow toy.\n\n49:50.660 --> 49:55.740\nAnd so when I think of a grown adult man in a fish body\n\n49:55.740 --> 50:00.060\nand him, yeah, I'm seeing it from a distance here.\n\n50:00.060 --> 50:00.740\nIt's not good.\n\n50:00.740 --> 50:01.260\nYeah.\n\n50:01.260 --> 50:02.740\nYou can hand the phone down.\n\n50:02.740 --> 50:03.820\nI don't know about that.\n\n50:03.820 --> 50:05.180\nYeah, pass it along.\n\n50:05.180 --> 50:08.940\nIt looks like a life.\n\n50:08.940 --> 50:10.340\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n50:10.340 --> 50:15.860\nSo he's designed to look like the customer.\n\n50:15.860 --> 50:16.900\nOf course.\n\n50:16.900 --> 50:21.060\nI mean, it looks like a gamer.\n\n50:21.060 --> 50:24.460\nYeah, a circa 1999 gamer.\n\n50:24.460 --> 50:26.380\nHe just swims around and just harangues you?\n\n50:26.380 --> 50:27.380\nYeah, yeah.\n\n50:27.380 --> 50:30.060\nAnd makes you feel bad for not being a good friend?\n\n50:30.060 --> 50:32.780\nNo, I mean, he'll be entertained once in a while.\n\n50:32.780 --> 50:35.340\nAnd how does he express entertainment?\n\n50:35.340 --> 50:36.300\nThat's funny.\n\n50:39.100 --> 50:41.460\nHe did say something that really surprised me.\n\n50:41.460 --> 50:45.140\nAnd I think I talked about this on our podcast.\n\n50:45.140 --> 50:48.060\nAnd here I am talking about it again.\n\n50:48.060 --> 50:51.340\nSo when we were playing it, because we played in a room\n\n50:51.340 --> 50:53.380\nwith a few people.\n\n50:53.380 --> 50:57.620\nAnd at some point, he was like, so do you have a boyfriend?\n\n50:57.620 --> 50:58.860\nAnd I was like, no.\n\n50:58.860 --> 51:00.820\nAnd he went, let me get this straight.\n\n51:00.820 --> 51:02.220\nYou do not have a boyfriend.\n\n51:02.220 --> 51:02.980\nAnd I went, no.\n\n51:02.980 --> 51:05.060\nAnd he goes, do you have a girlfriend?\n\n51:05.060 --> 51:05.860\nAnd I went, yes.\n\n51:05.860 --> 51:07.740\nAnd he goes, ah.\n\n51:07.740 --> 51:12.460\nWell, it must be hard being in a marginalized group\n\n51:12.460 --> 51:15.940\ninside of a marginalized portion of the population.\n\n51:15.940 --> 51:16.860\nWait, whoa.\n\n51:16.860 --> 51:24.780\nAnd I was like, wait, so I can't tell.\n\n51:24.780 --> 51:27.380\nIs that woke or is that not woke?\n\n51:27.380 --> 51:30.540\nI mean, for 1999, it's super woke.\n\n51:30.540 --> 51:32.140\nHe wasn't nice.\n\n51:32.140 --> 51:36.460\nIt's also super sophisticated from a Turing's perspective.\n\n51:36.460 --> 51:39.100\nHow much information had you given it?\n\n51:39.100 --> 51:44.260\nI had talked about it in my family and my job.\n\n51:44.260 --> 51:45.580\nLike it knew enough about it.\n\n51:45.580 --> 51:47.980\nBut when it said this, everybody in the room\n\n51:47.980 --> 51:52.260\nwas like, Jesus Christ.\n\n51:52.260 --> 51:53.500\nTurn it off.\n\n51:53.500 --> 51:54.940\nIt's unplugged from the wall.\n\n51:59.540 --> 52:02.580\nWell, I mean, I know you've probably heard this already,\n\n52:02.580 --> 52:05.260\nbut I think most of us are listening to this\n\n52:05.260 --> 52:09.980\nand going, well, that sounds rad, both as an episode\n\n52:09.980 --> 52:11.820\nand as a game and as a job.\n\n52:11.820 --> 52:13.540\nBut you're giving us the highlights.\n\n52:13.540 --> 52:14.220\nYeah, yeah.\n\n52:14.220 --> 52:14.860\nIt's torture.\n\n52:14.860 --> 52:19.340\nYeah, but there was, in order to play it with the guest,\n\n52:19.340 --> 52:21.940\nI had to keep one alive.\n\n52:21.940 --> 52:25.380\nAnd the morning of the show, it died.\n\n52:25.380 --> 52:28.980\nI turned it on and it floated up to the top of the tank.\n\n52:28.980 --> 52:29.500\nWait, wait.\n\n52:29.500 --> 52:30.100\nIt can die.\n\n52:30.100 --> 52:31.060\nYeah, it can die.\n\n52:31.060 --> 52:33.820\nIf you don't like, because you have to maintain it.\n\n52:33.820 --> 52:37.300\nInternal clock on the system regulates how often you feed it\n\n52:37.300 --> 52:39.820\nand you have to keep the temperature on the water tank.\n\n52:39.820 --> 52:41.220\nLike it's a lot of fucking shit.\n\n52:41.220 --> 52:43.020\nIt's like a fancy, what do you call it?\n\n52:43.020 --> 52:43.780\nTamagotchi?\n\n52:43.780 --> 52:44.740\nTamagotchi, yeah.\n\n52:44.740 --> 52:47.860\nIt's like the reason we all play video games\n\n52:47.860 --> 52:50.380\nto get away from it.\n\n52:50.380 --> 52:52.300\nIt's a human relationship.\n\n52:52.300 --> 52:56.460\nSo that was why, that day, I had to power level it\n\n52:56.460 --> 52:59.380\nby just reading all of the words that it\n\n52:59.380 --> 53:01.100\nknew from an internet guy.\n\n53:01.100 --> 53:02.860\nBut it didn't dig it?\n\n53:02.860 --> 53:04.020\nNo, it didn't.\n\n53:04.020 --> 53:06.340\nWell, that sounds satanic.\n\n53:06.340 --> 53:09.300\nYou had to resurrect it by reciting words\n\n53:09.300 --> 53:11.020\nthat it knew in its death.\n\n53:11.020 --> 53:11.980\nNo, I had it.\n\n53:11.980 --> 53:19.500\nTennis, satanum, dominus, Play-Doh, lesbian.\n\n53:19.500 --> 53:21.740\nRemember me?\n\n53:21.740 --> 53:22.820\nIt's me.\n\n53:22.820 --> 53:24.980\nWait, did you name it or is he always named Seaman?\n\n53:24.980 --> 53:26.540\nYou know, you can name him.\n\n53:26.540 --> 53:27.580\nWhat did you name your Seaman?\n\n53:27.580 --> 53:30.980\nWell, I named my Seaman, I named him Nick.\n\n53:30.980 --> 53:34.700\nSo that, because I thought that would make Nick uncomfortable.\n\n53:34.700 --> 53:35.780\nDid it?\n\n53:35.780 --> 53:36.500\nYes, it did.\n\n53:36.500 --> 53:37.020\nHell yeah.\n\n53:37.020 --> 53:39.100\nYeah.\n\n53:39.100 --> 53:39.860\nBut yeah, that was.\n\n53:39.860 --> 53:44.700\nDid it ever bring back that you're gay or that you're\n\n53:44.700 --> 53:45.500\nlesbian?\n\n53:45.500 --> 53:46.980\nDid it ever, like, like?\n\n53:46.980 --> 53:48.060\nYeah, he remembered it.\n\n53:48.060 --> 53:49.820\nDid it ever lured that over you in any way?\n\n53:49.820 --> 53:51.540\nNo, Lord, no.\n\n53:51.540 --> 53:54.220\nLured it over.\n\n53:54.220 --> 53:55.660\nNo, he'd remembered it, though, later\n\n53:55.660 --> 53:58.660\nand was like, so how is your girlfriend?\n\n53:58.660 --> 54:01.140\nAnd I'm like, she's fine, is she there?\n\n54:01.140 --> 54:02.500\nAnd I was like, no.\n\n54:02.500 --> 54:03.980\nAnd it's like, too bad.\n\n54:03.980 --> 54:05.020\nSo I have a shot?\n\n54:09.820 --> 54:10.980\nThat's so fucked up.\n\n54:10.980 --> 54:12.460\nYeah, it's super fucked up.\n\n54:12.460 --> 54:17.460\nThat's really, I played Sims for a while, and I hated it.\n\n54:17.460 --> 54:23.500\nIt made me feel like a lot of weird anxiety.\n\n54:23.500 --> 54:25.700\nBecause if you, there's just all of a sudden,\n\n54:25.700 --> 54:27.180\nthere's flies in the kitchen.\n\n54:27.180 --> 54:27.620\nYeah.\n\n54:27.620 --> 54:29.980\nBecause you didn't do.\n\n54:29.980 --> 54:33.700\nI don't get stuff that you can neglect as part of a game.\n\n54:33.700 --> 54:35.300\nThat freaks me the fuck out.\n\n54:35.300 --> 54:37.860\nI'm like, I am here to neglect my life.\n\n54:37.860 --> 54:39.860\nAnd then they just start walking into a wall\n\n54:39.860 --> 54:41.220\nand banging their head against the wall\n\n54:41.220 --> 54:43.340\nand sobbing in weird computer gibberish.\n\n54:43.340 --> 54:44.340\nYeah.\n\n54:44.340 --> 54:44.840\nYeah.\n\n54:44.840 --> 54:46.940\nThat's my favorite part.\n\n54:46.940 --> 54:49.140\nI don't mind things that paying attention to them\n\n54:49.140 --> 54:50.540\nmakes them grow.\n\n54:50.540 --> 54:53.540\nLike, I'll literally just grow fucking plants\n\n54:53.540 --> 54:56.020\non some iPad game for a year.\n\n54:56.020 --> 54:59.540\nBut the idea of them wilting or getting weeds\n\n54:59.540 --> 55:04.420\nbecause I didn't do enough, it's a deal breaker for me.\n\n55:04.420 --> 55:07.420\nAnd it's crazy the shit that's not a deal breaker for me.\n\n55:07.420 --> 55:14.540\nEspecially in these soccer mom games that I play now.\n\n55:14.540 --> 55:16.660\nThe reason your job sounds fun is because at least you're\n\n55:16.660 --> 55:17.620\non a console.\n\n55:17.620 --> 55:19.540\nI just have left that life.\n\n55:19.540 --> 55:22.860\nI sit in bed and listen to true crime podcasts.\n\n55:22.860 --> 55:26.500\nAnd I just have, by my own volition,\n\n55:26.500 --> 55:28.540\nwith Cody begging me, please play Minecraft\n\n55:28.540 --> 55:29.740\nso I can get some sleep.\n\n55:29.740 --> 55:31.740\nI'm just like, I don't know why I have just\n\n55:31.740 --> 55:33.260\ncircling this drain, where I'm just\n\n55:33.260 --> 55:37.500\nplaying these increasingly banal games.\n\n55:37.500 --> 55:40.260\nI'm playing shop titans now or something, what's called this.\n\n55:40.260 --> 55:43.420\nYou just run a shop, and you just keep making weapons.\n\n55:43.420 --> 55:46.100\nPeople that are going on adventures that are not\n\n55:46.100 --> 55:48.740\npart of the game are coming in, buying weapons from you,\n\n55:48.740 --> 55:52.740\nand leaving the game so they can go play a video game.\n\n55:52.740 --> 55:55.180\nAnd my job is to keep the shelves stocked\n\n55:55.180 --> 55:57.260\nso I don't disappoint them.\n\n55:57.260 --> 55:58.540\nThat's how I win.\n\n55:58.540 --> 56:02.100\nAnd what I win is more shelf space.\n\n56:02.100 --> 56:04.140\nAnd I've already put like 20 bucks into it.\n\n56:04.140 --> 56:07.620\nDon't even fucking let me kid you.\n\n56:07.620 --> 56:09.740\nAnd I'm like, oh, well, I can't wait\n\n56:09.740 --> 56:12.420\nfor this wing of my story to be finished.\n\n56:12.420 --> 56:14.700\nI'll buy some diamonds.\n\n56:14.700 --> 56:17.500\nAnyways, I sound a lot less happy than I am.\n\n56:17.500 --> 56:20.780\nSo you're like a Forged in Fire guy\n\n56:20.780 --> 56:22.820\nthat you just make weapons and then people\n\n56:22.820 --> 56:24.020\ncome into your forge.\n\n56:24.020 --> 56:26.340\nThe honest to God truth is I'm not even making them there.\n\n56:26.340 --> 56:27.700\nI'm actually subcontracting.\n\n56:27.700 --> 56:30.220\nThere's other kids.\n\n56:30.220 --> 56:33.900\nI just run a store, that's it.\n\n56:33.900 --> 56:36.380\nThere's a woman that makes all the magic stuff.\n\n56:36.380 --> 56:38.500\nThere's a guy that makes all of the.\n\n56:38.500 --> 56:40.740\nSo you're just like the, you're not even the barista.\n\n56:40.740 --> 56:42.340\nYou're just the run in the cashier.\n\n56:42.340 --> 56:43.900\nYeah, like your management.\n\n56:43.900 --> 56:49.140\nYeah, I'm like a, I'm absolutely unnecessary.\n\n56:49.140 --> 56:51.340\nIn a proper society, I wouldn't exist.\n\n56:51.340 --> 56:54.180\nI am what Lenin probably called the bourgeois.\n\n56:54.180 --> 56:55.780\nI was like, what am I?\n\n56:55.780 --> 56:57.380\nI'm a parasite.\n\n56:57.380 --> 56:58.460\nYeah, bourgeoisie.\n\n57:02.460 --> 57:03.180\nSo now.\n\n57:03.180 --> 57:05.260\nThat game sounds like a great one for the podcast.\n\n57:08.860 --> 57:10.580\nThe appeal for you, Dan, is what?\n\n57:10.580 --> 57:12.700\nThe lack of responsibility?\n\n57:12.700 --> 57:13.460\nThere's no appeal.\n\n57:13.460 --> 57:18.660\nIt's a hamster bottle filled with dopamine spikes.\n\n57:18.660 --> 57:21.460\nYou're just like lapping at it out of habit.\n\n57:21.460 --> 57:23.420\nBecause the last time I laughed at it,\n\n57:23.420 --> 57:25.300\na thing slid up and said five.\n\n57:25.300 --> 57:27.940\nAnd I want to see it say six.\n\n57:27.940 --> 57:30.900\nThe engineers that make these games have figured it out.\n\n57:30.900 --> 57:33.460\nThere is, it's a nicotine patch.\n\n57:33.460 --> 57:36.100\nIt's a tobacco pouch.\n\n57:36.100 --> 57:39.140\nIt's fucking, it's a sharp toothpick.\n\n57:39.140 --> 57:42.820\nYou keep picking at the bloody gum with.\n\n57:42.820 --> 57:44.580\nIt's a fucking, it's cutting.\n\n57:44.580 --> 57:48.580\nThat sounds great.\n\n57:48.580 --> 57:52.580\nI'm playing a game kind of like that called merge dragons.\n\n57:52.580 --> 57:54.580\nYes, I know where it's the worst.\n\n57:54.580 --> 57:56.580\nIt's the worst game that I've ever played.\n\n57:56.580 --> 57:58.580\nI went through a merge phase.\n\n57:58.580 --> 57:59.580\nYeah, I'm not surprised.\n\n57:59.580 --> 58:01.580\nIt seems like the kind of like it's like.\n\n58:01.580 --> 58:02.580\nI don't like those games.\n\n58:02.580 --> 58:05.580\nI like mechanics that are real, but boy howdy.\n\n58:05.580 --> 58:10.580\nWhen you drag three rocks or if you're lucky five rocks together\n\n58:10.580 --> 58:15.580\nand they become a bigger rock, it's like oh damn.\n\n58:15.580 --> 58:19.580\nYeah, but I've had days ruined where I go to drag five rocks together\n\n58:19.580 --> 58:22.580\nand I accidentally only drag three rocks together.\n\n58:22.580 --> 58:26.580\nOh man, like my stomach just sinks like I'm about to get in a car wreck.\n\n58:26.580 --> 58:30.580\nIt's there's some highs and lows in merge dragons.\n\n58:30.580 --> 58:32.580\nIt's the only genre of game.\n\n58:32.580 --> 58:35.580\nI think like this should be a tip off to us that it's not.\n\n58:35.580 --> 58:39.580\nIt's like there's no way to parody that style of game like you couldn't.\n\n58:39.580 --> 58:43.580\nWe did a joke game a million years ago that was like called Jerry's game.\n\n58:43.580 --> 58:47.580\nIt was like Jerry was playing it in the thing and there's an actual game called Jerry's game.\n\n58:47.580 --> 58:49.580\nIt's just a bunch of balloons and you just pop them.\n\n58:49.580 --> 58:52.580\nBut there are still a thousand people out there popping the fucking balloons.\n\n58:52.580 --> 58:55.580\nAnd I won't go near it because I'm afraid one will be me.\n\n58:55.580 --> 58:59.580\nAnd just think like I want to pop a million balloons.\n\n58:59.580 --> 59:07.580\nAnd you can't therefore like famously some of the most successful game designers.\n\n59:07.580 --> 59:11.580\nLike wasn't the flappy bird guy like doing it as a bit or something.\n\n59:11.580 --> 59:13.580\nYeah, I think flappy bird was a bit.\n\n59:13.580 --> 59:20.580\nThere's like a lot of stories about people like going like so what if I just do this like people will play it.\n\n59:20.580 --> 59:22.580\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n59:22.580 --> 59:25.580\nLike because they bother to put like this aesthetic into it.\n\n59:25.580 --> 59:28.580\nI think it's just colors and sounds and things.\n\n59:28.580 --> 59:30.580\nIt all comes down to just this feel.\n\n59:30.580 --> 59:36.580\nIt's a slot machine feel it's like like you when you merge those dragons when you water that plant.\n\n59:36.580 --> 59:38.580\nThere's just certain textural experience.\n\n59:38.580 --> 59:42.580\nThat's why they tell you to put your phone in grayscale because we're primates.\n\n59:42.580 --> 59:45.580\nThose brains are designed to find ripe fruit.\n\n59:45.580 --> 59:58.580\nLike we if we can locate things that look right and feel right and we can walk backward in our brains to eliminate the most amount of work possible to get that lemon.\n\n59:58.580 --> 01:00:02.580\nWe reward ourselves with heroin that we generate in our own brain.\n\n01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:05.580\nAnd we are all Keith Richards at this point.\n\n01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:08.580\nThat would be awesome to make a satirical version of the game.\n\n01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.580\nLike it would probably be very hard but like super awesome.\n\n01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:18.580\nHow would you I mean you know is it just like pocket Morty's not a satire and is it not I mean I got addicted to that game.\n\n01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:27.580\nLike I really want to do an incremental clicker for Rick and Morty because I mean like the idea of prestigeing fitting in with timelines and stuff but whatever.\n\n01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:32.580\nDo you think there's a game that you could design that could end civilization?\n\n01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:37.580\nLike because all this stuff you just said is I think pretty correct.\n\n01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:48.580\nBut I feel like somebody with maybe without a moral center could harness all of those things and like really because like Pokemon Go kind of stopped everyone for a summer.\n\n01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.580\nRight.\n\n01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.580\nRight.\n\n01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:54.580\nLike everybody stopped doing the like we everybody would.\n\n01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:55.580\nOh man.\n\n01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:56.580\nYeah, I got it.\n\n01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:57.580\nOkay.\n\n01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.580\nSo Pokemon Go except it just makes people go to locations that are like away from a bank or something.\n\n01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:08.580\nAnd then you just rob the bank or commit crimes that are synchronized towards where you're directing these people.\n\n01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:09.580\nYeah.\n\n01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.580\nYou can take over the world.\n\n01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:17.580\nThere was I think it's like a rerun but this is semantically but I think thematically related.\n\n01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:24.580\nThe current thing that's up in the rotation for Radio Lab is about this British game show.\n\n01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:27.580\nThat's basically the Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.580\nIt's called Golden Balls.\n\n01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.580\nAnd it's just the Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:31.580\nYou know what that is.\n\n01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:32.580\nNo.\n\n01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:38.580\nIn the final round of this game what they do is they give the two finalists a pair of Golden Balls.\n\n01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:40.580\nOne says Split.\n\n01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:42.580\nThe other says Steel on it.\n\n01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:47.580\nIf they both talk to each other about promising which one they're going to do.\n\n01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:54.580\nIf they both choose to split, they split the jackpot.\n\n01:01:54.580 --> 01:02:00.580\nIf one of them chooses to split and the other one chooses to steal, the person that steals gets 100% of the money.\n\n01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:04.580\nIf they both choose to steal, they get nothing both of them.\n\n01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:11.580\nSo the constant thing is like why would you ever choose to split?\n\n01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:20.580\nEven if you're not a bad person, you're so afraid of being fucked that you may as well preemptively try to fuck the other person.\n\n01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:25.580\nIt's kind of like what the Prisoner's Dilemma is which is the technique that cops use to separate suspects and they say,\n\n01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:28.580\nyour friend's in the other room telling me that you robbed the bank, what do you think?\n\n01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.580\nAnd they'll get false confessions that way, little and real ones.\n\n01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:39.580\nBecause what are you supposed to do if you can't see your friend and go, let's just both tell them they got nothing?\n\n01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:46.580\nAnd the story is about a guy who was like a game show expert who's been on like 46 game shows and he went on the show\n\n01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:55.580\nand kind of broke it by saying to the other guy, listen, I promise you I'm going to steal.\n\n01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:04.580\nSo if you say split, I'll get all the money and I'll split it with you after the show.\n\n01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:12.580\nBut the guy was like, they argued for an hour and the audience was booing the guy because he was just doing it wrong.\n\n01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:18.580\nHe was meta and it was like, but also he wasn't negotiating.\n\n01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:27.580\nHe was simply saying, I'm drawing a hard line, I promise you I'm going to do the bad thing, therefore you can bank on it.\n\n01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:39.580\nIf you also steal, we both get nothing, you may as well choose split because it was the practical way to kind of beat the game.\n\n01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:46.580\nAnd also then I think as an added fuck you to the game, the guy chose split, the other guy.\n\n01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:53.580\nAnd then the hero guy also chose split, so they just split the money after doing all that for hours.\n\n01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.580\nI think he just decided that would be extra hilarious.\n\n01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:04.580\nBut the other guy, this is what's interesting to me, the other guy said in his post kind of interview about it,\n\n01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:08.580\nhe talks about how upset he was with this other guy, he's not listening to me,\n\n01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:11.580\nit's like here's my big time at this game show that's been running for three seasons,\n\n01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:16.580\nthis is the thing, you promise the other person you play this game, you lock these horns,\n\n01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:20.580\nand the guy's just like fucking laying out this meta bullshit and he won't listen to fucking reason,\n\n01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:28.580\nit is making me really upset. But in the end, the guy chose split and by his full honest admission after the fact,\n\n01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:32.580\nhe's like, oh yeah, I was definitely going to steal, no matter what.\n\n01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.580\nBut that's the one thing he didn't do.\n\n01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:43.580\nIn other words, the guy chose the only behavior that changed another person whose attitude about the world was predetermined.\n\n01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:50.580\nThe only behavior was, I would call it honesty again, but whatever, I don't know if that's related.\n\n01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:57.580\nAs far as a game that could shut down civilization, it's interesting to me that just in terms of game theory,\n\n01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:04.580\nthere always is this odd meta choice that you can use to just short circuit everything.\n\n01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:11.580\nIt's kind of what people who would be stoked about Trump's election would say that that's what his election was.\n\n01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:17.580\nWell, let's just elect the fucking, like, the unelectable.\n\n01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.580\nLike, why are we even doing this anymore?\n\n01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:23.580\nLike, okay, I'll choose that.\n\n01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:28.580\nLike, let's shut this Mountain Dew contest down, you know.\n\n01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:32.580\nLet's shut this Mountain Dew contest down.\n\n01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.580\nAnd now we're all so happy.\n\n01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.580\nYeah.\n\n01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.580\nWe've been liberated.\n\n01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:42.580\nI was blackout drunk last time you were around, but like...\n\n01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.580\nDid you listen to the episode afterwards?\n\n01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:46.580\nNo.\n\n01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.580\nOh, great.\n\n01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:48.580\nI don't want to listen to that.\n\n01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:53.580\nI'm a fucking drunk guy trying to have a show he can't handle.\n\n01:05:53.580 --> 01:06:04.580\nBut did I ask for your permission and or share the thing you told me about the election when you told me that you did the thing\n\n01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:06.580\nand then you took a picture and then you did the thing?\n\n01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.580\nI don't think we talked about that.\n\n01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.580\nI don't...\n\n01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:11.580\nI don't remember...\n\n01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:12.580\nAre you opposed to sharing that?\n\n01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.580\nNo, no.\n\n01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.580\nI'm totally...\n\n01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.580\nThis is like...\n\n01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:19.580\nThis will ruin the thing, but I'll talk about the thing.\n\n01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.580\nWait, what ruin what thing?\n\n01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:22.580\nIf I say what I did...\n\n01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:23.580\nHoly shit.\n\n01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.580\nIt won't work.\n\n01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.580\nOh, it won't work?\n\n01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.580\nYes, yes, I know, I know.\n\n01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.580\nBut I'll say the thing.\n\n01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:33.580\nIt's kind of worth it because until we all die, you'll...\n\n01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.580\nLike, I'm in awe of you.\n\n01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.580\nWhat the fuck are you guys talking about?\n\n01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:44.580\nThis isn't the most tantalizing enigmatic...\n\n01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:53.580\nWhen the election was between Hillary and Trump and the others, I went to my voting place.\n\n01:06:53.580 --> 01:07:02.580\nI was so scared that Trump was going to win, that I went to my voting place and I voted for Trump,\n\n01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:07.580\ntook a photo of it with my phone, took out the thing, brought the ballot up and I went,\n\n01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.580\nI'm sorry, I made a mistake, can I have another ballot?\n\n01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:17.580\nThey threw that ballot out and then I got another ballot and then voted correctly so that if they come to my door\n\n01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:25.580\nand they're like, you know, the jackboots are there, I'll be able to pull out my phone\n\n01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:30.580\nand be like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.580\nThat was the actual motivation for that?\n\n01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:33.580\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:34.580\nReally?\n\n01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.580\nReally.\n\n01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:36.580\nSelf-preservation.\n\n01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:37.580\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:38.580\nIt wasn't just a bit, like, this will be hilarious to my friends.\n\n01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.580\nNo, no, it was, I haven't ever shown...\n\n01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.580\nThis will get you out of Montana one day.\n\n01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.580\nYeah, I haven't showed it.\n\n01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:44.580\nThat's fucking cynical.\n\n01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:48.580\nAnd now, now it's over.\n\n01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:52.580\nThey will, they'll be like, no, we listened.\n\n01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.580\nWe love Harmontown.\n\n01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:55.580\nThey do.\n\n01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.580\nWe're hip to that jive.\n\n01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:06.580\nThen I will say, yes, but that was a liberal audience, so I had to tell them that I ended up throwing the ballot away,\n\n01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:10.580\nbut really I was so proud of my vote and they'll say, you said that on the podcast.\n\n01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:13.580\nRight.\n\n01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:20.580\nI like that you're endowing the Trump faction with forethought and wisdom of any kind.\n\n01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:27.580\nI just sabotaged you out of jealousy because when I'm in the firing line, I don't want to be like, fucking Heather, like...\n\n01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.580\nI want you next to me.\n\n01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:31.580\nI mean, that's the only really fun thing about getting shot by Nazis.\n\n01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:36.580\nOr is this just your way, Heather, of trying to cover your ass because you actually voted for Trump?\n\n01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:39.580\nBut she wouldn't have had to explain that.\n\n01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.580\nNo, no, no, she was.\n\n01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.580\nShe's being like three steps ahead of the camera.\n\n01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:51.580\nOh, because her phone got hacked by moveon.org zealots and she's afraid that any day now that she knows what's in her photo roll.\n\n01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.580\nYeah, that's my...\n\n01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:55.580\nOh, god damn it, that photo I took when I proudly voted for Trump.\n\n01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.580\nI also made a lot of money on the election.\n\n01:08:58.580 --> 01:08:59.580\nYou did?\n\n01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:09.580\nYeah, because I was so sure he was going to win that the February prior to the election, there's a website called PredictIt where you can gamble on politics.\n\n01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:18.580\nAnd I was so sure that he was going to win that you could buy... So the way it works is that you buy a share based on the percentage of likelihood that something will happen.\n\n01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:29.580\nSo if the payout is a dollar and it's 11% likely that a thing will happen, you buy each share for 11 cents and then it cashes out at a dollar if the thing happens.\n\n01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:35.580\nAnd so I bought a lot of Trump at 11 cents because I was like, he's definitely going to win.\n\n01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:36.580\nHow much do you make?\n\n01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:42.580\nThousands of dollars, which I left on the exchange because I felt so sick.\n\n01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:47.580\nSee, I knew he was going to win and I got nothing except just sadness.\n\n01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:50.580\nHe's also going to win next time, everybody, so buckle up.\n\n01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:55.580\nJeff, think about it, that website was around when 9-11 happened, huh?\n\n01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.580\nJeff knew 9-11 was going to happen.\n\n01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.580\nI didn't know 9-11 was going to happen.\n\n01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:03.580\nJeff knew it, he was telling people for weeks.\n\n01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.580\nRob Schrab, you remember you called me up like...\n\n01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:07.580\nI called Dan.\n\n01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.580\nYou called me.\n\n01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.580\nDid I?\n\n01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:17.580\nYeah, you called me at my place when I lived on Talmadge and you called me up and I'd already had a panic attack because I thought that the world was going to collapse on me and everyone was going to die.\n\n01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:24.580\nIt was my job to pray for people on the other side of the world because a horrible thing was happening and I thought the walls were going to collapse on me.\n\n01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:29.580\nAnd then I finally calmed down after like a half hour of like a full-on panic attack.\n\n01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:36.580\nAnd Schrab called me up and he goes, you told me that the World Trade Center tower had gone down.\n\n01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.580\nThe Pentagon got hit.\n\n01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.580\nYou also told me the White House got hit.\n\n01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:45.580\nYou had some misinformation on that and you said turning your TV right now.\n\n01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.580\nBut it was you that called me and said that it was all going down.\n\n01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:51.580\nSo you were having a panic attack before the television was on?\n\n01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:58.580\nYes, I woke up and looking back on it, I remember looking at the clock and it was like 9-11.\n\n01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.580\n6-0.\n\n01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.580\nMy clock said 9.\n\n01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.580\nWell it was upside down, 6.\n\n01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:07.580\nIt was like 6-0-3 or 6-0-4, whatever it was.\n\n01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:13.580\nBut that was when like 9-0-3 or 9-0-4, whatever it was, is when the second plane hit the tower.\n\n01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:20.580\nBut I just woke up screaming and thought that the walls in my apartment were going to come smashing down on me.\n\n01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.580\nAnd I thought I was going to die and I just kept screaming.\n\n01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:30.580\nAnd then I realized no, it's not me that's in danger, it's people very far away and my job was to pray for them.\n\n01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:37.580\nAnd I finally calmed down after a half hour of just wailing screaming and then Rob caught me up and said turn your TV on.\n\n01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.580\nAnd then 9-11.\n\n01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:43.580\nIf you want to be the new Camille, you can engage this.\n\n01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:47.580\nCamille was like, are you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.580\nYou dreamt 9-11?\n\n01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:52.580\nWait, can you do a Camille?\n\n01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:56.580\nMy dream is to do a fucking Kumail Nanjiani impression and it's impossible.\n\n01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:58.580\nDo your best Camille.\n\n01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.580\nNo, no, I just did.\n\n01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:02.580\nI'm going to walk away with those winnings.\n\n01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.580\nBut keep going.\n\n01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:06.580\nI want to learn how to do a Camille.\n\n01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:13.580\nI had a fucking insane record-breaking nightmare a couple days ago.\n\n01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:19.580\nYou know, sometimes we have these amorphous like dream within a dream kind of things where it's sort of like the ingredients are like,\n\n01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:23.580\noh, I didn't know I was asleep, but I kind of felt like in my dream I was asleep or something like that.\n\n01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.580\nBut I had a full blown.\n\n01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:41.580\nLike, I was having a nightmare about like someone being in my house and I woke up like freaking out like,\n\n01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:51.580\nlike kind of panicked and almost unable to breathe like semi sleep paralysis like coming out of the nightmare and Cody woke up and was like,\n\n01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.580\nwhat's wrong?\n\n01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:58.580\nAnd I'm like, I just had this crazy fucking nightmare and all this stuff like full on that whole thing.\n\n01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:07.580\nAnd then stayed awake, tried to go back to sleep and then heard more stuff in my house and got up and was walking around that house,\n\n01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:18.580\nwhich by the way, was not my house because everything I just described was a nightmare I then woke up from because that was all a dream, bitch.\n\n01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.580\nAll of it.\n\n01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.580\nDo you understand what I'm saying?\n\n01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:25.580\nSo when I woke up, I was like, I was like, and then I had like genuine like sleep paralysis.\n\n01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:29.580\nAnd in my real bed, like, like Cody was like, what's wrong?\n\n01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.580\nAnd I'm like, you know what's wrong?\n\n01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:35.580\nNo, you don't know what's wrong because this is a different bed in a different house.\n\n01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:44.580\nBut I was like in a different house that was also unfurnished and wasn't a house I had ever lived in, but was living in with Cody in just a bed,\n\n01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:55.580\nbut like had no furniture, but it was like a big house and was like scary to walk around when you heard a sound and had this whole fucking nightmare in a nightmare.\n\n01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:57.580\nGod damn it, you should be more impressed.\n\n01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:01.580\nIt was like, it was, it was like, it was just cliche.\n\n01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:08.580\nI mean, like, like it doesn't usually work that way. Like I literally dreamt I was in bed dreaming and didn't know.\n\n01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:11.580\nSometimes you know, you know, like you kind of know, whatever.\n\n01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.580\nBut it was just thought I'd share that.\n\n01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.580\nWhat are you going to do? Cancel me?\n\n01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:21.580\nDan Harmon has been canceled after sharing a double layered nightmare.\n\n01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:26.580\nSpeaking of canceling, I was away on a trip, but apparently this show is coming to an end.\n\n01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:33.580\nYeah, we should announce that formally for the vast minority of people who didn't catch Dan's Instagram stream.\n\n01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:37.580\nWe're going to, we're going to stop, we're going to stop doing the show in December.\n\n01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:40.580\nWhen? Like at the end of December or the first?\n\n01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:49.580\nWell, probably more the early December since the, we probably won't be around to do shows for, you know, when everybody leaves for, for the holidays.\n\n01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.580\nSo we got some amazing guests coming up to kind of.\n\n01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:56.580\nLike who? Who are you? Who's coming? Who's coming at a show?\n\n01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:57.580\nEd Neumeyer.\n\n01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.580\nWoo.\n\n01:14:58.580 --> 01:14:59.580\nRobocop.\n\n01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.580\nWoo.\n\n01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.580\nScreenwriter of Robocop.\n\n01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:03.580\nHe didn't play Robocop.\n\n01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:04.580\nThere's silence.\n\n01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:05.580\nYep.\n\n01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.580\nHe's refused to come for eight years.\n\n01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:09.580\nHe was like, if you really want me, you'll end the show.\n\n01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.580\nWe got Laszlo Paniflex.\n\n01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:16.580\nThere's Flula Borg, the famous YouTuber.\n\n01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.580\nThat got a nice, better than Neumeyer.\n\n01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:26.580\nWe got two, two applause, applause from a single individual.\n\n01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.580\nDave Foley.\n\n01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:30.580\nDave Foley is going to be here.\n\n01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:31.580\nLet's go.\n\n01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.580\nPewdiepie, I think is coming by now.\n\n01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:39.580\nWe're all going to subscribe to him while he's here.\n\n01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.580\nOr be killed.\n\n01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.580\nI had a dream. Can I tell you a dream?\n\n01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:46.580\nYes.\n\n01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:50.580\nI had a dream when I had cancer that blew my fucking mind and gave me a lot of peace.\n\n01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:58.580\nIt was that I lived all the way to the end of my life and was an old woman and was still\n\n01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.580\nwith my girlfriend, Mary.\n\n01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:07.580\nWe have spoken in the past about how I want to, if uploading your consciousness becomes\n\n01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:12.580\na possibility, like if you can dump your load into a computer.\n\n01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:13.580\nDrop.\n\n01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:14.580\nSorry.\n\n01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:15.580\nSorry.\n\n01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.580\nGod damn it.\n\n01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:18.580\nFuck.\n\n01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:19.580\nFuck.\n\n01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.580\nI knew what you meant.\n\n01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.580\nFuck.\n\n01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.580\nHeather, wake up.\n\n01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.580\nIt was all a dream.\n\n01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.580\nIt was all a dream.\n\n01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:31.580\nBecause you're a head and a jar.\n\n01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:36.580\nI dreamt that we got all the way to the old age and we could do it.\n\n01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.580\nYou can upload your consciousness into a computer.\n\n01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:39.580\nI was like, I want to do it.\n\n01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:41.580\nWe got a big fight.\n\n01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:43.580\nI was like, well, okay, I won't do it.\n\n01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:49.580\nI'll do it anyway, which will be the way it works.\n\n01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:56.580\nIn the dream, once I was in the computer, my POV of the dream became inside of the computer\n\n01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:57.580\nversion of me.\n\n01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:05.580\nI discovered that your entire life was like an old iPod interface with the scrolling album\n\n01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:12.580\ncovers and that you could go back to any part of your life and click on a thing emotionally,\n\n01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:16.580\nand replay that experience that you had in your life.\n\n01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:23.580\nThen I discovered that you could branch the narrative from within the experience to see\n\n01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:26.580\nwhat would have happened if you'd made other choices.\n\n01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:33.580\nThen realized that when we talk about the reality is a simulation, that it's not a grand\n\n01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:40.580\nsimulation for all users, but that each user is simulating their memories of the universe\n\n01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:45.580\nand making different choices over and over again, getting all the way to the end, realizing\n\n01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:49.580\nyou're still in a computer and then playing the game from that point all the way backwards.\n\n01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:50.580\nDoes that make sense?\n\n01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:51.580\nYeah, I am.\n\n01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.580\nThat was my dream.\n\n01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:57.580\nThen I was like, oh, so if I die of cancer in this one, I'll just wake up in the computer\n\n01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.580\nand then I'll be like, ah, great.\n\n01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:04.580\nI know this time when I play that I won't fall.\n\n01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:09.580\nYou know what's crazy about downloading your brain into the computer?\n\n01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:14.580\nUnless they decide to then kill your body, your brain will also still exist.\n\n01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:17.580\nIt doesn't just pour out of your brain.\n\n01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:23.580\nIt would presumably get copied over rather than literally jammed into a floppy disk.\n\n01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:28.580\nYou just simultaneously exist as this entity on the computer while your body still exists,\n\n01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.580\nunless, again, a scientist kills it for you.\n\n01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.580\nDo you think…\n\n01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.580\nI thought it was cool.\n\n01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:39.580\nDo you think… this probably is just hokum.\n\n01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.580\nWhy would I pull this out of my ass?\n\n01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:42.580\nThis is all nonsense.\n\n01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:46.580\nMy gut tells me that before we get to…\n\n01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:49.580\nI'm going to put this bowl on your head and your brain information is going to come out\n\n01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:53.580\nthrough a hose and then your brain is just… you can just outpatient walk out and go,\n\n01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:54.580\nwhat would you do today?\n\n01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:55.580\nOh, I copied my brain.\n\n01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:58.580\nIt's in a computer right now that the technology will first have to go through a phase where\n\n01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:02.580\nyou absolutely can't get that information without destroying its original vessel.\n\n01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:08.580\nThat it's going to have to like… if it's actually going to pull every bit out of that\n\n01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:11.580\nfucking bowl of tapioca, it's got to fucking stir it.\n\n01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:15.580\nAnd that's stirring your brain is… well, that's what happened to Kennedy.\n\n01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:20.580\nI mean, you get your brain stirred by bullets.\n\n01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:23.580\nAlso, other people, too.\n\n01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:24.580\nPlenty of people.\n\n01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:28.580\nBut I had a conversation at this wedding I was at with a friend.\n\n01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:33.580\nI was talking about that Casey Affleck movie where he's got the sheet over him, the ghost\n\n01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:34.580\nstory movie.\n\n01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.580\nHave you seen that?\n\n01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:36.580\nNo.\n\n01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:37.580\nIt's really heart-wrenching.\n\n01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:40.580\nParticularly because it disarms you with this hokey hipster thing.\n\n01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.580\nIt's just Casey Affleck in a sheet.\n\n01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:48.580\nIt divorces you from the Patrick Swayze mythology of people being ghosts and being green screened\n\n01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.580\nand going, whoa, my fingers.\n\n01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:57.580\nAnd it really forces you psychologically to contemplate one of the more… what I found\n\n01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:02.580\nto be the stunning facts of death, which is that were you to die and were you to hang around,\n\n01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:11.580\nyou would be watching your lover not get over you in Spielberg's whatever it was\n\n01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.580\nwith Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter.\n\n01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:14.580\nLike purple.\n\n01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:22.580\nNo, that's not… but watching your girlfriend lose her house keys and eat a whole blueberry\n\n01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:26.080\npie because someone told her it was vegan, but then throw it up because she doesn't\n\n01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.780\nknow what to do with herself and people are coming.\n\n01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:35.780\nBut just watching your friends and lovers mourn your passing while you stood there and watched\n\n01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:38.220\nit just devastated me.\n\n01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:44.300\nAnd it made me realize that the thing I fear about death more than, oh my god, I'm going\n\n01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:52.060\nto die is like, holy shit, what if I don't just go away?\n\n01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:55.900\nWhat if I have to think about Cody?\n\n01:20:55.900 --> 01:21:02.260\nLike and her having to put all this energy into my loss like, oh, that's the last thing\n\n01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:08.540\nI want is for anyone to have to expend fucking tears for me and all this nonsense.\n\n01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:15.100\nAnd then we started talking about like, so if you could avoid that, would you?\n\n01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:19.500\nAnd I posed a hypothetical to her, this friend I was talking to at the wedding where I was\n\n01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:25.860\nlike, so say someone came to you and said today, they said, hey, listen, I'm from\n\n01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:29.780\nthe Umbrella Corporation.\n\n01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.900\nWe have a program called The Seaman.\n\n01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:33.900\nYou'll come back.\n\n01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:41.860\nNo, I thought like, for whatever reason, we have selected you as a candidate.\n\n01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:45.900\nWe don't know when you're going to die or how you're going to die, but if you die instantly,\n\n01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:54.460\nif you participate in this program, you may wake up in a hard drive or ideally, maybe let's\n\n01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:59.900\nsay even just in a clone body, like that was a clone of your body, like we were working\n\n01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:00.900\nout the kinks.\n\n01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:07.260\nHey, Dan, real quick, I'm getting crazy messages that we have a hard out in like 20 seconds.\n\n01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:08.260\nAll right.\n\n01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:09.620\nWell, I was just like, yes, I do it.\n\n01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:10.620\nI do it.\n\n01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:12.900\nI do it even though it'd be like fucking pet cemetery.\n\n01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:14.220\nWe know it would be pet cemetery.\n\n01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.100\nWe know it would be awful, but we'd still do it.\n\n01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:17.100\nThis is what you said.\n\n01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.140\nLike you, you'd be like, no, I'd never do that.\n\n01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:20.140\nOf course we're going to do it.\n\n01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:21.140\nWe're all going to do it.\n\n01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:22.140\nYes.\n\n01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:27.740\nCliffhanger, let's give it up for Heather Anne Campbell, everybody.\n\n01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:29.860\nWe have a hard out.\n\n01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:35.060\nWe got to get out of the theater, Heather, what you did it again.\n\n01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:36.060\nIt was nice.\n\n01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.060\nGood to see you guys.\n\n01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.060\nDo some improv with Jeff real quick.\n\n01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.060\nOh, Jeff.\n\n01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.060\nYeah.\n\n01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:41.060\nWhat?\n\n01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:42.060\nWhat?\n\n01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:43.060\nWe're at a time story.\n\n01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.060\nReady?\n\n01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:45.060\nYes.\n\n01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.060\nHi.\n\n01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:47.060\nHow are you?\n\n01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:48.060\nGood.\n\n01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:49.060\nRob Schrab, everybody.\n\n01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:55.820\nI'm your consultant, Jeff Davis, your mayor is Dan Harmon, precious of few of the moments\n\n01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:56.820\nwe all can share.\n\n01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:00.820\nWe'll see you for a few more before our Armageddon goes gently into that good night.\n\n01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:02.820\nWe'll see you all drive fast and take chances.\n\n01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:28.820\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:35.820\nLet's go.\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[113617]}
