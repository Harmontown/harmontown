00:00.000 --> 00:27.600
Hello, gang. How's it going? Thank you for coming.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
My name is Comptroller Jeff Davis and Harmontown is now in session.

00:37.000 --> 01:06.000
Rob Schrab.

01:06.000 --> 01:21.000
Hey, hey, Spencer Crittenden.

01:21.000 --> 01:32.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

01:32.000 --> 01:47.000
Hi. Thanks, folks.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
All right. We got a lot of show for you tonight, so let me get my thoughts out there.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Looking good, Dan.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Thanks, buddy. I wasn't fishing for that.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
Is that a Hawaiian design on your shirt there, that design?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
There's a shirt from Tahiti.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Can I see your shirt?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Thank you.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
That's Tahiti on it.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Looks Hawaiian.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
You guys see this documentary about Michelle Carter, the young lady who was famous a while back.

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
Remember the big viral story, she encouraged the suicide of her boyfriend through text messages.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Remember that?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
No.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Can I watch this documentary?

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
I think it's a mini, maybe there's a couple parts, and I can't remember where the hell.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Sorry. Just Google it. There's got to be one documentary.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
Sorry, I should have got my facts straight, but I really recommend it. It's fucking incredible.

02:46.000 --> 02:54.000
It's mind-blowing to me how you receive the story, and it's like, how many more details could you possibly get?

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
You felt at the time that you got the details, and that's what's click-clickable about stuff is always the gritty details.

03:01.000 --> 03:09.000
But the documentary kind of reveals that most things probably, if you get all the gritty details,

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
where it becomes this homogenous paste and what you have is a big fucking pudding of a couple crazy kids,

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
neither of which really deserve, I mean, I don't, I personally got to the end of the documentary

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
feeling like, if I was a judge, I wouldn't charge her with anything.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
And if you haven't watched the documentary, I realize how insane that must sound, which is why you have to watch it,

03:34.000 --> 03:45.000
because we all read the same headlines and news stories, and it's pretty crazy to see how directed your thoughts get

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
by the total just impersonal system of click-following.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
What's selling? What are people going to click on?

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
And how underneath it, mythically, it really does have to do with,

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
like, there's a journalist in there who kind of lays it down and goes like, this has to do with teenage girls

04:06.000 --> 04:15.000
and our desire to believe that they're crazy, stupid, psycho, spoiled, you know,

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
and we click on that story over and over again, like we have these archetypes that we want to invest in.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Check out that documentary.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
The only reason I wrote it down is because I was like, so they have this title sequence,

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
it's like one of those fancy HBO show, it's kind of title sequence that's just kind of images,

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
and I was like, am I getting older? Am I just finding more stuff in poor taste now?

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
The title sequence is just a smoky interior of a car.

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
It's just like smoke and like a gear shift and I'm like, what, don't, what, because the guy killed himself

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
with the carbon monoxide in his car.

04:56.000 --> 05:05.000
And it's like, so it's like, I was like, smoky car, yeah, I get it, like Mickey Mouse in it,

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
you know, like creatively that's offensive before you even get into psychologically.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Anyways, all right, okay, moving right along, did you know goats?

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
We were at a wedding, they had goats at the wedding, or the wedding was at a place that had goats.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
You know, they got squared.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
Wait, wait, which wasn't?

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
Well, I'm not going to cast any dispersions because both families are from Georgia, so, but no, it was a,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
they're good, they're good.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Were goats invited to the wedding or this is a wedding that was goat-adjacent?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
It was the husband's family.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
It was at this crazy kind of like greenhouse farm in Santa Barbara.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Yeah, it was a beautiful remote farm location.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
The actual service was right on this like plane overlooking the beach like you see in like a Hollywood movie

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
of a wedding and we're like, that doesn't happen in real life.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
It was nuts.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Do you see those goats?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Did you hear, were you there?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh yeah, I'm well acquainted with goat pupils.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Continue.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Oh yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Goat pupils are rectangular.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yes, they are.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
90 degree quarters.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
You didn't know this?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
They look like panorama thumbnails.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
No.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Because they have 330 degrees.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
We've been doing this podcast for seven years and we never, you still don't know that goat

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
rectangles.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
You still don't know this?

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
It's so that goats can have 330 degree vision, which at first you think-

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
That's hot.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
You're a goat who even cares what's in front of you.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Wait, were these goats just-

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
That's exactly the point.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Were these goats just intermittent?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Were they wandering about?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
They're in a pen.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
I hear that goats' legs on one side are shorter than the other.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Is that true?

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
But then you look around and you see all these other animals.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
You see some chickens.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
He evaded your question, Rob.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
You see how he evaded that?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I want to get to the truth.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
And you see some cows.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Or I'm just finishing my bet.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I might be just finishing my bet.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
You look around and you see some chickens and some cows.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
And they all got these big round eyes and the goat's like, what did you have for breakfast?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Rectangular.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Yeah, that's why they need them.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
330 degree vision.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
When's the last time you ate a goat?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Brother?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Last week.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
But you guys had some funny questions about that.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
Rob says, Rob alleges that half of goat's legs are shorter than the other half.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
I think that's maybe there's a certain breed of goats.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
There's certain subspecies or whatever.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Circle goats.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Unless that's a myth.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Yeah, because they're born on the side of mountains.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Whoa.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I grew up with a goat.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
We had a goat when I was a kid.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
That's awesome.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
And then one day our horse fell on the goat and knocked one of the horns out of the goat's head.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Have I told the story before?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
No.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
What happened?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
The goat just told you.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Shut up.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
The goat.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I'm busy.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
The goat had one of his horns.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I think it was his left horn.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Completely.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
Steve Levy on the ice machine.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
The horn was not clear out of its head.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
And then maggots would get into it because now there was a clean path into its brain.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Sure.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
We've talked about this before.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
How could there not be?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Clean path into its brain.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah, and then I would have to trade off with my brother for the shittiest chore of all time

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
was go out with a can of, a spray can of iodine and a spoon.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Sure.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
A metal spoon, like a big like.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
You ever scoop out any brains?

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
No, because I didn't have to get that far in there.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.300
But I had to go and spray yellow, awful iodine and like headlock a goat and spray iodine

08:37.300 --> 08:41.000
into it, which the goat, guess what, didn't like that.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Sure.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.600
And then I would take the spoon and scrape out the maggots and throw them out and it would

08:45.600 --> 08:51.040
make a kind of a scrappy bone sound because we had to do that until the, until the horn

08:51.040 --> 08:56.000
started regrowing and I didn't have to scrape maggots out of a goat face.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Well, you didn't finish your story.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Huh?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
You didn't finish your story.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
What?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Long story short, I'm fucking it.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
You know what I mean?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Fucking it.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Fucking the brain hole.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
So the end of your bit was chickens and cows have round eyes.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
No, the end of the bit.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
And you were upset that we didn't know you were doing a bit.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
The end of the bit when he says, what did you have for breakfast?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Upset?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Bored?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Yeah.

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
Like, like, like over it, you know, just like, yeah, I'll finish talking about this.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
What did you have for breakfast?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
What did you have for breakfast?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
That was the joke.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
You know what?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
That's a metaphor for that goat.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Life.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
The rust belt.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Oh, okay.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Lost its horn.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
You know, clear path to its brain.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Okay.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Through that wound.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Maggot set in.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Wizard of Oz kind of shit.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yeah.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.640
I was, I was just to finish, I was getting to the goat thanked Jeff.

09:51.640 --> 09:52.840
He said, thank you.

09:52.840 --> 09:55.000
You know, that's like Jeff's stories.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Oh, the goat thanked me.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Oh, the goat thanked you.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Thank you.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
I just think that, okay, so I was thinking about my dogs today while I was in the pool.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
And I was, I was, I suddenly thought like, you know, because we put all this to do about

10:07.000 --> 10:13.600
like, oh, mankind shaped dogs like development, you know, and like, but then I started to

10:13.600 --> 10:17.000
think like, because it was, you know, I've always used the example of like, well, you

10:17.000 --> 10:22.300
know, there's a, it's like what we're not saying about that shaping is that the dogs

10:22.300 --> 10:27.000
that didn't behave or look the way we liked, you know, they ended up thrown on the campfire.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
And it was like, like, that's how you like shape an animal that fast and it's just like

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
awful eugenics.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.600
But then I was thinking today, I was like, you know, these dogs, like, because I was

10:36.600 --> 10:41.760
watching Harvey's tail and I'm like, he's in a new house and there's a, I've read online

10:41.760 --> 10:45.640
about the vocabulary of their tails, you know, there's a whole language to their tails.

10:45.640 --> 10:51.520
It's like, it's certain altitudes and angles and then like amounts of rhythms of wagging

10:51.520 --> 10:53.120
and all this stuff.

10:53.120 --> 10:59.000
And I was like, you know, but there was nothing that I read in the article about dogs tails

10:59.000 --> 11:01.360
that actually surprised me.

11:01.360 --> 11:05.040
And then it made me, I was like, well, yeah, that's kind of a, I already knew that I already,

11:05.040 --> 11:10.160
I didn't see it written in print, but I knew that the higher the tail this and the slower

11:10.160 --> 11:11.640
the tail that and blah, blah, blah.

11:11.640 --> 11:16.080
And then I was thinking today, I'm like, he's not, so I have an inborn sense in me as a

11:16.080 --> 11:24.320
homo sapien of like dog tail recognizing just as much as dogs are being born that have this

11:24.320 --> 11:30.120
sort of innate sense of like, they look at the more expressive side of our face.

11:30.120 --> 11:34.160
They don't know they're being born with this, like these predisposed bread into their gene

11:34.160 --> 11:37.880
pool, like a couplings with human behavior.

11:37.880 --> 11:42.160
And I'm starting to think like, well, geez, we're human, you know, don't you think that

11:42.160 --> 11:50.120
there's a certain amount to which like only the humans that understood dogs well enough

11:50.120 --> 11:54.680
survived to reproduce with other humans?

11:54.680 --> 11:55.680
Yeah.

11:55.680 --> 12:02.120
After, after a certain point, like if you're just not a dog person, by the way, how many

12:02.120 --> 12:05.000
not a dog people are here, homo sapiens?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Not a lot.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.200
I mean, some of you don't have dogs, but a lot of people hate cats, I don't get them.

12:11.200 --> 12:16.040
But like, like, like, like, how many people are just like, I'm not a dog, dog person.

12:16.040 --> 12:20.080
Like maybe not a dog owner, because you're scared, you don't want to like, you know,

12:20.080 --> 12:22.000
engage in this freaky relationship.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
I get that.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.320
You're saying that the humans love of dogs, that that is a, we've been bred out.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.880
Dog haters are gone.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.960
They don't, they don't get laid.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.680
They might even get mauled to death.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.160
We don't know what dead men tell no tales.

12:37.160 --> 12:41.160
Are there any dog, does anybody here, like, and be honest, and don't just, you know,

12:41.160 --> 12:44.120
don't like, lie about it, but like, there's anybody, don't try to be a hero by saying

12:44.120 --> 12:45.120
you hate dogs.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.120
Yeah.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.960
But does anybody here actually have an aversion to dogs?

12:47.960 --> 12:48.960
Aversion is different.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.760
I could say though, there's a lot of people with allergies, there's people who could be

12:51.760 --> 12:55.520
scared of dogs, but there was no applause for that.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.520
Right.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.080
I mean, I'm just, yeah, like, like, it really is cliche, but that whole man's best friend

12:59.080 --> 13:00.080
thing.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.560
It's like, geez, there's a two way street happening.

13:01.560 --> 13:05.800
I just thought today, it was like, holy cow, man, who's walking who, you know, I mean,

13:05.800 --> 13:10.440
I'm sure we've had a tremendous impact, but like, like, like we, I bet there's a whole

13:10.440 --> 13:18.080
like, like, like splinter of humans that don't exist because they couldn't read the tail

13:18.080 --> 13:19.080
right.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.080
You know what I mean?

13:20.080 --> 13:22.640
What does the high tail mean versus the low tail?

13:22.640 --> 13:24.360
Well, the high tail is just general.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.680
Like, I mean, what do you think it means?

13:25.680 --> 13:28.960
What do you feel it means in your heart if a dog's got its tail, like, way up in the

13:28.960 --> 13:29.960
air?

13:29.960 --> 13:30.960
Excitement.

13:30.960 --> 13:31.960
Yeah.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.240
I mean, like, well, and, and, and positive excitement, right?

13:34.240 --> 13:40.240
Like, not just, what, what, what, seems like a clickbait to me, like the article,

13:40.240 --> 13:44.320
I don't know what your dog's feeling based on tail.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.760
When it's wagging fast, it's happy.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.760
What do you think?

13:47.760 --> 13:48.760
When it's wagging slowly.

13:48.760 --> 13:49.760
It's less happy.

13:49.760 --> 13:50.760
What do you think?

13:50.760 --> 13:53.760
What about a dog when its tail is straight?

13:53.760 --> 13:58.040
Like, like, like if it's a sticking straight out, like a board, right?

13:58.040 --> 14:03.320
Like, like, totally like a squirrel is in its area when it's down.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.320
We all know what that means.

14:04.320 --> 14:07.520
We use that expression for ourselves on week.

14:07.520 --> 14:11.200
And then there's a whole language to their barks too, which we also instinctively understand.

14:11.200 --> 14:17.560
You test humans, including human non-dog owners, and they all have an innate understanding

14:17.560 --> 14:21.920
of which types of barks mean there's a person at the door, someone's trying to break into

14:21.920 --> 14:25.800
my car, they saw an animal, like humans.

14:25.800 --> 14:30.040
Do a bark for me and I'm going to, I'm going to give you my, I'm going to give you my honest,

14:30.040 --> 14:34.720
like, like, like Rorschach tests, like, like, like you, you give me, can I help?

14:34.720 --> 14:35.720
Yeah.

14:35.720 --> 14:36.720
Yeah, I'm going to help you.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.000
So are we doing the barks or are reading the barks?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Are you barking?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.400
No, I'm going to, I'm going to reveal some things I've learned about dog barking by

14:43.400 --> 14:44.400
trial.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.760
I'm going to do, I'm going to do a dog bark.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.240
He'll do it and then we'll talk it over.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.240
Yeah.

14:48.240 --> 14:51.440
You do a bark and then Schrab and I and Spencer, we're going to, we're going to analyze.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.440
Okay.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.520
But don't look at my face because I'll give it away because I'm human.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.520
So like, like, like, yeah.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.520
Okay.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.520
Eyes closed.

14:57.520 --> 14:58.520
Okay.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.520
So here's dog bark number one.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.520
You tell me what this means.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.520
Okay.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.360
And this is based on an actual bark that you are familiar with.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.360
I'm not looking at you.

15:04.360 --> 15:09.440
Yeah, and also I heard a thing on a podcast of two that breaks down like what, the vocabulary

15:09.440 --> 15:10.440
of dog barks.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.080
Like, what's the bark podcast?

15:12.080 --> 15:13.080
I can't remember.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.080
I don't know.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.080
It doesn't matter.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.080
They didn't do any work.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.080
They don't deserve any credit.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.080
Okay.

15:19.080 --> 15:24.480
I, I, I, I, I'm not looking at dog number one and tell me, tell me, tell me what this

15:24.480 --> 15:25.480
means.

15:25.480 --> 15:26.480
Okay.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.440
Spencer, Schrab and I are going to, going to evaluate your bark.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.440
Okay.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.880
Got so much lint on my leg.

15:31.880 --> 15:32.880
Stay focused Schrab.

15:32.880 --> 15:33.880
Okay.

15:33.880 --> 15:34.880
Okay.

15:34.880 --> 15:35.880
I got it.

15:35.880 --> 15:36.880
I got it.

15:36.880 --> 15:37.880
I think I got it.

15:37.880 --> 15:38.880
Spencer, what do you think?

15:38.880 --> 15:39.880
That means everything.

15:39.880 --> 15:40.880
Right?

15:40.880 --> 15:41.880
What you got, Rob?

15:41.880 --> 15:42.880
I think get up.

15:42.880 --> 15:54.760
Get, it means get, get out of here.

15:54.760 --> 15:55.760
Go, go.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.880
I think that it's a stranger danger.

15:57.880 --> 15:58.880
Yeah.

15:58.880 --> 15:59.880
Yeah.

15:59.880 --> 16:00.880
Yeah.

16:00.880 --> 16:01.880
Okay.

16:01.880 --> 16:02.880
So here's, here's one of the things.

16:02.880 --> 16:03.880
Okay.

16:03.880 --> 16:04.880
Let me try one more.

16:04.880 --> 16:05.880
And then we'll bring our guests out.

16:05.880 --> 16:06.880
One more.

16:06.880 --> 16:07.880
No, we're going to do fucking 30 of these.

16:07.880 --> 16:08.880
Well, we'll do it.

16:08.880 --> 16:09.880
We'll do it with her.

16:09.880 --> 16:10.880
Yeah.

16:10.880 --> 16:11.880
We'll bring it.

16:11.880 --> 16:12.880
Okay.

16:12.880 --> 16:13.880
Um, she's a, she's a veterinarian.

16:13.880 --> 16:14.880
You're going to love her.

16:14.880 --> 16:15.880
Okay.

16:15.880 --> 16:16.880
Um, the, uh, here's, here's, here's another, uh, type.

16:16.880 --> 16:17.880
So tell me what you think this part.

16:17.880 --> 16:18.880
Can I look at you this time?

16:18.880 --> 16:19.880
No.

16:19.880 --> 16:20.880
Well, no, I'd rather you didn't.

16:20.880 --> 16:21.880
Okay.

16:21.880 --> 16:22.880
Okay.

16:22.880 --> 16:23.880
Okay.

16:23.880 --> 16:24.880
Okay.

16:24.880 --> 16:25.880
I'm going to express with my face.

16:25.880 --> 16:26.880
Like, I'm going to have towels.

16:26.880 --> 16:27.880
Okay.

16:27.880 --> 16:28.880
Here we go.

16:28.880 --> 16:40.880
Do it one more time.

16:40.880 --> 16:46.880
Can I have the bark?

16:46.880 --> 16:47.880
No, I'm not joking.

16:47.880 --> 16:48.880
Give it to me.

16:48.880 --> 16:49.880
I know.

16:49.880 --> 16:50.880
I know.

16:50.880 --> 16:51.880
I know.

16:51.880 --> 16:52.880
I know.

16:52.880 --> 16:53.880
Because that, that, that was a lot.

16:53.880 --> 16:54.880
I think I can do better too.

16:54.880 --> 16:55.880
That was a lot.

16:55.880 --> 16:56.880
Yeah.

16:56.880 --> 16:57.880
Can I have the bark?

16:57.880 --> 16:58.880
Yeah.

16:58.880 --> 16:59.880
You just ended up doing Seth Meyers.

16:59.880 --> 17:00.880
Okay.

17:00.880 --> 17:01.880
Um, all right.

17:01.880 --> 17:02.880
All right.

17:02.880 --> 17:12.880
It is just that paint the space.

17:12.880 --> 17:13.880
Yeah.

17:13.880 --> 17:14.880
Yeah.

17:14.880 --> 17:15.880
You don't look at my face.

17:15.880 --> 17:16.880
I will never.

17:16.880 --> 17:17.880
Okay.

17:17.880 --> 17:22.880
Just come on.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.880
That means war is hell, man.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.880
They got Johnny.

17:26.880 --> 17:27.880
Yeah.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.880
I think that means to stay away from my food.

17:30.880 --> 17:31.880
Yes.

17:31.880 --> 17:32.880
To whom?

17:32.880 --> 17:33.880
To whom?

17:33.880 --> 17:34.880
Another dog.

17:34.880 --> 17:35.880
Yes.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.880
Now, how does he know that?

17:38.880 --> 17:41.880
What I learned in the podcast is the vocabulary of dogs.

17:41.880 --> 17:45.880
It's about sharpness of the bark versus like gravel.

17:45.880 --> 17:46.880
So that's it.

17:46.880 --> 17:51.880
And it's about, so they're, um, uh, the more the sharper, uh, the,

17:51.880 --> 17:52.880
the barks with more fidelity.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.880
Like if you looked at them on an oscilloscope, the ones with a

17:55.880 --> 17:59.880
minute shape to them, that are just punctuated sharp, sharp.

17:59.880 --> 18:03.880
They're, they're, they're announcing something, but if there's

18:03.880 --> 18:04.880
like more gravel.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.880
Can I give you a scenario?

18:06.880 --> 18:09.880
Can I give you a scenario and then you could do a bark?

18:09.880 --> 18:10.880
Okay.

18:10.880 --> 18:11.880
Okay.

18:11.880 --> 18:12.880
Okay.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.880
My question is because we have, we have, there's a stranger at

18:14.880 --> 18:15.880
the door.

18:15.880 --> 18:16.880
That's that right.

18:16.880 --> 18:17.880
Well, can I do it?

18:17.880 --> 18:18.880
Wait, can I just do third one?

18:18.880 --> 18:19.880
I want to do a third one.

18:19.880 --> 18:20.880
Cover your eyes.

18:20.880 --> 18:21.880
Cover your eyes.

18:21.880 --> 18:22.880
Emotionally nuanced one.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.880
Don't look at me because if you look at me, you'll know what

18:24.880 --> 18:25.880
it is.

18:25.880 --> 18:26.880
And we'll go back to what I wanted.

18:26.880 --> 18:27.880
Okay.

18:27.880 --> 18:28.880
Cover.

18:28.880 --> 18:29.880
Yeah.

18:29.880 --> 18:30.880
All right.

18:30.880 --> 18:31.880
Okay.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.880
It was a good idea.

18:34.880 --> 18:35.880
Okay.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.880
Here it goes.

18:36.880 --> 18:37.880
Here it goes.

18:37.880 --> 18:38.880
I'm not looking.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.880
What do you guys think?

18:39.880 --> 18:52.880
I would say take, try that one more time.

18:52.880 --> 18:53.880
Okay.

18:53.880 --> 19:06.880
I think that's a dog that is sleepy and has taken mescalem.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.880
I see it's a good thing you didn't look at me.

19:09.880 --> 19:13.880
See, I think, I think that's like a dog like, like wanting to

19:13.880 --> 19:17.880
kind of play or whatever, kind of, you know, kind of.

19:17.880 --> 19:23.880
There's a dog asking if they had gluten free rolls and then

19:23.880 --> 19:26.880
realizing, you know what, it's about the carbs with me.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.880
I can't pretend it's healthy just because of some fucking

19:29.880 --> 19:30.880
gluten word I learned yesterday.

19:30.880 --> 19:31.880
I'm out of here.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.880
I want to lose weight.

19:33.880 --> 19:34.880
Our next guest.

19:34.880 --> 19:35.880
Oh yeah.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.880
What was your bit?

19:37.880 --> 19:38.880
I was good.

19:38.880 --> 19:39.880
It's not a bit.

19:39.880 --> 19:43.880
Why don't we bring out the guest and have her be a part of this?

19:43.880 --> 19:45.880
That could be fun.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.880
This is absolutely steamroll.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.880
This important inquiry that we're doing right now.

19:50.880 --> 19:51.880
Okay.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.880
Our next guest has already been a guest very recently too.

19:53.880 --> 19:54.880
I just like her.

19:54.880 --> 19:55.880
I thought we'd have her back.

19:55.880 --> 20:14.880
Let's have Heather Anne Campbell come out.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.880
Hello, Heather Anne Campbell.

20:15.880 --> 20:16.880
Hey, sorry.

20:16.880 --> 20:17.880
Hello, hi.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.880
Heather Anne Campbell, one of my favorite improvisers and

20:19.880 --> 20:21.880
favorite peoples in the universe.

20:21.880 --> 20:22.880
Hello.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.880
It's good to see you.

20:23.880 --> 20:24.880
Hi, Jeff.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.880
You look like the dark night version of like a Mario

20:27.880 --> 20:28.880
brother.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.880
I'll take it.

20:30.880 --> 20:31.880
I'll take it.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.880
We're kind of in the same outfit.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.880
Totally unplanned.

20:35.880 --> 20:36.880
Yeah.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.880
You both have like coveralls on.

20:39.880 --> 20:40.880
Yeah.

20:40.880 --> 20:41.880
And a hat.

20:41.880 --> 20:42.880
And a hat.

20:42.880 --> 20:43.880
What are you doing?

20:43.880 --> 20:44.880
What are you doing?

20:44.880 --> 20:45.880
I've got a blazzy.

20:45.880 --> 20:46.880
Uh, I almost ate my потребa.

20:46.880 --> 20:47.880
No, you don't have to wash.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.880
Rob got steamrolled before you came out.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.880
What did you, what were you going to, what was the dog?

20:52.880 --> 20:53.880
I was going to give you a scenario.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.880
And I wanted to hear what the dog.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.880
Heather, are you a dog owner?

20:56.880 --> 20:57.880
Jesus Christ.

20:57.880 --> 21:02.880
I just want to talk it five times in a row with this shit.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.880
Heather, are you a dog aficionado?

21:04.880 --> 21:05.880
Are you a dog lover?

21:05.880 --> 21:06.880
Dog Liker.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.880
Do you have a dog?

21:07.880 --> 21:08.880
I'm not doing it now.

21:08.880 --> 21:09.880
No, I'm not.

21:09.880 --> 21:10.880
No, I'm not.

21:10.880 --> 21:17.620
I want to bring our guest into the fold here Schrab. No, I feel like I feel like he had something you needed to say

21:17.620 --> 21:22.300
So if you if you have something I'll I can take we can take a moment and I'll answer

21:22.300 --> 21:27.580
Oh, we can come back to that. I only ask I like are you a dog person? Is this okay if I answer this?

21:28.140 --> 21:30.140
Yes, okay great

21:30.220 --> 21:37.020
So I do I'm taking yes. I I co-own a dog with my girlfriend. Okay. It's primarily her dog

21:37.020 --> 21:43.200
But now it is also my dog fantastic. So you're qualified to weigh in on this dog. Yes inquiry that we are engaging

21:44.320 --> 21:51.620
It is a it is a Maltese and it's completely wall-eyed and it just came we just found out it as Cushing's disease

21:53.060 --> 21:56.360
What does that mean? That's where it plays grandma of Tarkin and Star Wars

21:56.360 --> 22:07.480
If you want to see an unearned mug

22:08.680 --> 22:11.960
Five dollars a month five dollars a month while it lasts

22:15.960 --> 22:19.960
What is Cushing's disease? I hope it's not serious. I hope it's adorable. Well, no

22:19.960 --> 22:26.580
Uh, it thinks hot dogs are socks. Come on Cushing. That would be it would be it's not a it

22:26.880 --> 22:32.640
It has a tumor on either. It's it's it's pituitary or adrenal glands

22:32.640 --> 22:40.440
Which a release a bunch of cortisol into its blood, which is the stress hormone. So the dog is totally stressed out all the time

22:40.440 --> 22:50.480
And yet you find it delightful if you knew how dumb the dog looked

22:52.400 --> 22:56.640
But there it's on medicine and hopefully it's treat it's totally treatable

22:56.640 --> 23:00.520
It's just not the most ideal way for a dog to live, but it's gonna be okay

23:01.240 --> 23:07.460
Is that a disease that exists in humans or just in dogs? I I I don't know. I don't know

23:07.460 --> 23:14.000
I'm not a yes. Yes Cushing's disease affects human beings and dogs. It is transferable from one to the other

23:15.920 --> 23:18.520
Okay, great. I got a woo. So that's correct

23:19.920 --> 23:25.520
All right, so say I said all right Schrab. What was your thing gonna be just totally okay?

23:25.520 --> 23:28.080
So I was just gonna say you're working on anything Heather

23:28.080 --> 23:33.680
Yeah, I got one

23:41.160 --> 23:43.320
This is what you're like to other people

23:46.080 --> 23:50.360
That's true very true very true I

23:50.360 --> 23:58.520
Was gonna say like I want to give you a scenario I want to hear what the dog bark with

23:58.880 --> 24:02.440
Okay, and do we need to close our eyes while you do this right now?

24:04.280 --> 24:08.760
You're gonna know yeah, exactly so okay

24:09.800 --> 24:14.760
Pay attention to me to the owner like pay attention like pay attention

24:15.400 --> 24:17.980
You want to hear what that bark sounds like? Yeah

24:17.980 --> 24:21.660
You know pay attention me saying pay attention to me. Yeah, you're the dog

24:21.660 --> 24:25.720
And I'm like I'm like I'm my phone or I'm reading a book

24:25.720 --> 24:40.440
So get get try to really get my attention, okay, okay for real right

24:40.440 --> 24:42.440
Oh

24:54.880 --> 24:56.880
No

25:02.960 --> 25:04.960
Stop it

25:04.960 --> 25:11.760
Well, yeah, I nailed it. I just wanted that to go on for an hour. Yeah

25:13.900 --> 25:15.900
I

25:16.380 --> 25:22.160
You're the dog and you're trying to express to Rob your owner or Heather

25:23.980 --> 25:25.980
That

25:25.980 --> 25:44.600
You haven't been walked in a while and it's time to go romp and play. I'll do it Harvey does

25:48.780 --> 25:50.780
He does these like chew back of like

25:50.780 --> 25:55.680
Like utterances that are like human. It's like he's trying to talk like a person

25:56.520 --> 26:02.000
Heather, what's your dog's name Brooklyn Brooklyn Brooklyn my dog lolly?

26:04.460 --> 26:10.880
Sneezes okay when she wants to be paid attention to like if I'm in bed too long in the morning she'll go

26:10.880 --> 26:17.500
Does this Brooklyn do anything

26:19.820 --> 26:21.820
Brooklyn's too stressed out man

26:21.860 --> 26:23.860
Yeah, I'm curious what is

26:24.020 --> 26:31.180
Brooklyn is like for the last few months while she's been coming down with this has been perpetually laid out in the middle of the room

26:31.180 --> 26:40.980
Arms flat like belly flat on the ground arms spread out like the world is moving too quickly

26:40.980 --> 26:47.560
Yeah, like a bear rug. Yeah, but uh, yeah, I think I read that

26:48.020 --> 26:55.100
Sneezing in a dog means I'm not a threat like they'll sneeze when they play with each other to remind each other that they're not a threat

26:55.100 --> 27:00.660
I think she's I thought there was I thought my house was dirty. I got it. I like they're constantly

27:01.420 --> 27:07.280
You know like yeah together they do I'm like Jesus Christ. What's wrong with my house?

27:07.680 --> 27:09.640
Well, they do it to each other. Well, yeah

27:09.640 --> 27:14.180
They kind of like both like like especially if they've been laying around all day

27:14.180 --> 27:18.700
And then they kind of like start getting up and getting frisky, and then it's like

27:18.700 --> 27:26.760
Like they start sneezing all over the place. I think that means I'm not a threat. We're playing. I think I read that somewhere

27:27.300 --> 27:31.540
What does it mean that Nigel just fucks the hell out of Harvey like I?

27:32.340 --> 27:35.060
Think I know I think it's just like anxiety

27:35.740 --> 27:40.260
Like it says like like like because he Nigel can't win a game of fetch with Harvey

27:40.260 --> 27:44.020
So he's just learned now that's what I do that if he lets Harvey get the ball Harvey

27:44.020 --> 27:48.900
I'll eventually get so tired he has to lay down and like chew his ball and try to keep someone for taking it

27:48.900 --> 27:53.340
And then Nigel's just like like climbs up by him and just rails him for

27:54.100 --> 28:00.940
Until what until nothing he's a fixed dog like I don't it's can't be anything but pure just like comfort for him

28:00.940 --> 28:02.620
What is Harvey's like?

28:02.620 --> 28:09.100
What is the look on Harvey's face like Harvey just acts like either Harvey like acts like he paid for it like

28:09.980 --> 28:11.980
like he's like yeah

28:11.980 --> 28:14.460
But but like not like oh, yeah

28:14.460 --> 28:20.780
But I can't tell if Harvey's ignoring it if he's conscious of it because heart Nigel's not really getting anywhere near

28:21.460 --> 28:23.140
His actual

28:23.140 --> 28:29.900
Opening I mean Harvey's the size of a skyscraper compared to him. So he's just like rubbing his Harvey never has a very complicated

28:29.900 --> 28:36.940
Look in his eyes. He's a pretty simple. Yeah, but Nigel just like his legs are so much shorter

28:36.940 --> 28:45.700
So it's just like he just lays his front legs on Harvey like like but they just they don't touch the ground

28:45.700 --> 28:52.220
He just like like gets on his back and he puts both paws on either side of him and lays his chin down across

28:52.580 --> 28:54.580
Harvey's back and just

28:55.620 --> 28:57.940
For five dollars a month you can see

28:57.940 --> 29:05.060
But I don't know if I'm supposed to stop them. Do you know anything about this? I'm not asking cuz you're gay. I don't

29:07.420 --> 29:09.420
Asking cuz you're a dog owner

29:10.060 --> 29:16.980
Yeah, well, I mean okay, you know, it's supposed to stop. It's like sleepwalking. Is there anything like like this?

29:17.660 --> 29:24.700
I can't stop them. I think humans have a hair trigger for this domination talk when we think about dogs and how they interact with each other

29:24.700 --> 29:33.300
Like I did what I've learned from modern dog books is that we we we go to that word too much for it to explain their behavior

29:33.300 --> 29:36.540
My dog fucks where the food comes out of

29:37.340 --> 29:38.860
like it

29:38.860 --> 29:44.940
It has a it has a toy that delivers treats and after the treats have come out of the toy

29:45.340 --> 29:47.340
It fucks the toy

29:48.060 --> 29:51.500
So I don't know that it's dominance. I think I think it's I

29:51.500 --> 29:59.100
Think I think you're right because lolly has we got we got her a big stuffed animal

29:59.420 --> 30:06.860
Actually, it was Kate stuffed animal became lollies after we came home and caught her fucking the hell out of it

30:06.860 --> 30:08.860
And she was just like

30:10.660 --> 30:12.660
I was like, okay, well now it's yours

30:13.260 --> 30:15.180
Not gonna hang out with that anymore

30:15.180 --> 30:21.620
But but she'll like grab it and toss it around and flip it in the air and just like roll around on it and then

30:22.340 --> 30:28.060
Finish with a good old. Yeah, bonus. Yeah, same. Yeah, and my dog is a female dog

30:28.060 --> 30:34.820
So I don't so it's just fun. Yeah, I think I think if you want what I've learned is that when it's doing when she's

30:35.020 --> 30:39.620
Fucking her toy if I say good girl, she'll look at me and stop

30:39.620 --> 30:45.300
Like because of the screw. That's a normal reaction. Yeah, well, I think I

30:46.380 --> 30:51.020
Think I think she comes to and it's like, what am I doing?

30:55.700 --> 30:58.340
I mean, she's good at fucking where the food comes out

30:58.340 --> 31:04.540
I wonder if it feels good at all and if it does if that's not incredibly frustrating because it can't achieve

31:04.540 --> 31:11.380
The culmination do female dogs do like a hump like like like they actually do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay

31:11.380 --> 31:15.900
So there's a here's a here's something that Lollie does after she takes a shit

31:15.900 --> 31:19.180
So she'll take a shit and then she'll like

31:19.700 --> 31:26.020
Kick grass and dirt up and miss and all over the place like not even touching the shit

31:26.020 --> 31:28.980
She'll kick it on my face kick it on my arms kick it on the house

31:29.060 --> 31:31.580
Whatever it's all over the place misses it now

31:31.580 --> 31:35.940
I know she's trying what she's probably trying to do trying to cover up the shit

31:36.620 --> 31:42.580
So no other animals come around and go. Oh, there's shit here. I'm gonna have a little dog to eat later

31:42.580 --> 31:44.580
That's what I'm thinking

31:45.820 --> 31:47.900
But it's like hard wire to your brain

31:47.900 --> 31:54.220
I mean, I bet you're right, but boy, what a what an innocent time that must have been in the biosphere

31:54.300 --> 32:01.020
Where you could just window shop for feces. Hmm. Hmm smells like a rabbit's been around here

32:01.020 --> 32:04.780
I think I'll just set up camp and wait for it to come back take another shit

32:04.780 --> 32:07.740
Well, they probably do because they go, oh a rabbit eats a lot of grass

32:07.740 --> 32:11.460
So it's like oh, I'm gonna go after that thing and if you smell like I

32:12.060 --> 32:14.060
Know but cut to this blade runner

32:14.300 --> 32:19.380
Landscape of flaming smokes tax, but the animals are still doing the same things

32:19.380 --> 32:23.500
But it's like oh better bury that shit leste fucking jackalope

32:24.420 --> 32:27.780
Pray on me by smelling it. It's like you ain't got nothing to worry about

32:27.780 --> 32:33.060
Here's another thing flies why flies fly away when you go they're on the shit

32:33.580 --> 32:36.820
You walk up to the turd and the flies get they go run

32:37.940 --> 32:39.940
You're fine

32:39.940 --> 32:59.340
I wasn't gonna do anything you're fine. I'm not gonna take it away. I'm not gonna swat you

32:59.340 --> 33:05.900
But here's the thing here's my question to the room. So so my dog is really bad

33:05.900 --> 33:12.140
I'm covering up her own shit. I don't think she knows why she does it. She just knows I'm taking a shit

33:12.140 --> 33:16.340
I got to do this thing. It's in my hand. So she's doing it wrong and

33:16.820 --> 33:20.420
And I wish I could say hey you miss you're missing it

33:20.420 --> 33:25.820
Just if you're gonna do it do it right or whatever, but my question is what are we as human beings?

33:26.620 --> 33:34.380
Doing naturally right but completely wrong, you know, like if like the next evolutionary stage look down on what oh jeez

33:34.380 --> 33:40.500
Why are you you you're obviously doing that to do this, but you're doing it so well

33:40.500 --> 33:46.660
I'll tell you my vote here. We go lying. I think I think we're gonna look back. Well, maybe now we but like

33:47.220 --> 33:52.580
The next stage of our evolution. We're gonna be like holy shit people just kept lying

33:52.740 --> 33:57.780
It was like insane. It was killing them. They lied so much and there was nothing to hide

33:58.340 --> 34:01.580
What the hell were there and then they'll be like well, you don't understand at the time

34:01.580 --> 34:04.380
It was like if you told the truth about this then you could get a lot of trouble

34:04.380 --> 34:08.780
It's like yeah, but not if everyone told the truth and they're gonna be like really snobby about it

34:08.780 --> 34:11.300
They're gonna be like all you gotta do is just be honest

34:11.300 --> 34:15.740
But they won't have a choice because all of us be drives for brains that everyone could just look in

34:16.860 --> 34:20.860
And that but they're gonna be really happy and like incredibly horny

34:20.860 --> 34:30.560
Because you want to have to go to a bar to find out who's into tentacle porn

34:35.460 --> 34:37.460
Hey, oh one more animal fact

34:40.660 --> 34:46.740
Octopuses you guys know do you guys know that cows do you know why cows have hooves?

34:46.740 --> 34:52.820
Why do they they lack toes

35:04.780 --> 35:09.060
Do you know what do you know what do you know what a female buffalos as to

35:09.060 --> 35:19.340
Here we go I know why is she female do you know what a mommy buffalo says to her son when she drops him off at school you fucker I

35:20.140 --> 35:27.060
But you you said female buffalo house like bicep, but I didn't want to say it that early because that would be impressive

35:27.060 --> 35:40.460
What say it again? What is it? What is it? What is a mommy buffalo say to her son? You know why Heather Ann's back

35:40.460 --> 35:42.740
Why she text me today camble?

35:50.700 --> 35:52.700
Do you know why Heather Ann

35:52.700 --> 35:59.940
Camble, right? Yeah, she texted me today. Hey, I heard you like Hudson Hawk

36:00.660 --> 36:06.540
There's only one kind of person that texts that a Hudson Hawk fan, and I've only ever met one of them

36:07.420 --> 36:13.780
Text today. I like I like Hudson Hawk. All right. Okay. There's three of us. All right. I mean, I don't love it

36:13.780 --> 36:18.420
But it's it's think it deserves more credit. I think it was Danny. I yellows best turn

36:18.420 --> 36:26.260
As I said to Heather Ann today. I mean hey all other movies. Here's your medal for not trying

36:27.940 --> 36:29.940
What

36:33.780 --> 36:35.780
Hudson Hawk tries yes

36:39.140 --> 36:44.580
I I show the movie to friends once a year I make people watching on my birthday sometimes

36:44.580 --> 36:52.540
That's Xanadu Xanadu Xanadu is a fucking freak out. It's not a great movie, and yet I'm fascinated by it

36:52.540 --> 36:58.540
Yep, is Xanadu the one with the leather X that Connery wears? No, that's Zardos

36:59.940 --> 37:01.940
Zardos is fucking a bummer

37:02.460 --> 37:07.180
Zardos I want to like Zardos, but that movie does not want you to like it. No

37:07.180 --> 37:14.220
Zardos asks you to hate that movie. Yeah, because there's only so much Sean Connery wearing

37:15.780 --> 37:20.900
Underpants and high leather boots. I know I already mentioned this and I can't remember the director's name

37:20.900 --> 37:26.740
But the director's commentary for Zardos does begin with the director saying hello. I'm so and so I directed Zardos

37:26.740 --> 37:38.180
I'll be the first to admit it kind of got away from me. Let's proceed

37:38.180 --> 37:45.540
Wow, I mean the thing is the movie starts off the movie was was the Rick and Morty episode I show me what you got

37:45.540 --> 37:47.540
Well, that was that was a Zardos riff, right?

37:49.060 --> 37:51.060
The giant

37:51.060 --> 37:58.940
Yeah, the drop-in-loads heads that are on the Gazorpazort planet with that that give all the sex dolls to the to the male

37:59.220 --> 38:02.820
Population the surface dollars those heads are definitely Zardos heads

38:03.540 --> 38:09.700
But they also are supposed they look a little bit like Nick Manning the porn star and they drop loads and say dropping loads

38:10.100 --> 38:12.900
What happened to Nick Manning? He disappeared

38:13.540 --> 38:15.540
He was in a Batman

38:15.540 --> 38:17.140
porn parody

38:17.140 --> 38:21.620
Yeah, what year he's gone. He's his load just dropped off the face of the earth

38:22.020 --> 38:24.180
Who? Well, who are you talking about?

38:24.180 --> 38:26.180
Do you know Nick Manning?

38:27.220 --> 38:29.220
No, it's the it's the younger

38:29.460 --> 38:37.100
It's the guy you don't think there's a guy that every time he comes in a porno. He says dropping loads. I didn't I'm happily unfamiliar with that

38:39.100 --> 38:41.940
It's like it's like he was he was on stern a lot

38:41.940 --> 38:47.860
Like the stern was fascinated with it because he was the first porn star that I know of that if you're like all these decades of

38:48.260 --> 38:54.340
Of of porn movies like finally one male porn star just decided how about every time I come?

38:54.420 --> 39:00.740
I say the same thing no matter what movie I'm in no one can fire me. I just came drop and load

39:01.540 --> 39:05.140
He's in the batman one. He says

39:05.940 --> 39:07.940
dropping bat loads

39:08.180 --> 39:10.180
I mean

39:10.180 --> 39:13.300
I think that might have been his shark

39:13.940 --> 39:20.260
Nick Manning if if you're out there and you're in trouble like come tell us about it. Why is he dropping him?

39:20.580 --> 39:22.580
Dropping is so funny

39:25.620 --> 39:32.820
I know because it's not I mean it somebody I've ever read an article about like there you won't you won't see a lot of

39:33.780 --> 39:35.780
male porn star names

39:35.780 --> 39:39.460
They they don't tend to go for like the dick

39:40.180 --> 39:46.660
Hard-on like they don't they try to they steer they steer clear of like kind of like overtly

39:48.500 --> 39:50.500
kind of like

39:50.740 --> 39:55.300
evocations of erectness and impenetrability and things like that and and

39:55.860 --> 39:58.100
I there's some psychological reason for that

39:58.740 --> 40:04.100
Like like and and by the same token. That's probably why his catchphrase isn't like shooting lasers

40:04.100 --> 40:11.060
You know, it's just dropping loads. It's like is it you want to throw it away? You don't want to look what I do

40:11.060 --> 40:13.860
I fuck for a living. I don't fuck. I'm not I'm not flash Gordon

40:15.220 --> 40:21.620
Dropping loads. I I occasionally do a character on uh on our who's live shows where I'm the world's oldest porn star

40:22.340 --> 40:25.300
And his name is dust dusty loads. Yeah

40:25.300 --> 40:30.280
Well. Given low

40:31.140 --> 40:33.140
Did

40:34.580 --> 40:37.660
Granting granting a subscription access to loads

40:40.020 --> 40:43.540
Prop triggering giving free loads with an in-app purchase

40:46.900 --> 40:49.700
Beat of fucking eagle

40:50.340 --> 40:55.060
What road trying to loosen my load. That's the grossest lyric of all. Hey

40:55.060 --> 40:57.700
Hey Eagles, stop loosening your load.

40:57.700 --> 41:00.300
You know, I've never come what I would call a load.

41:00.300 --> 41:01.140
Huh?

41:01.140 --> 41:02.340
I've never come what I would call a load.

41:02.340 --> 41:04.540
What would you call, what would you call it?

41:04.540 --> 41:05.380
Not a load.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.380
I don't know, like a teaspoon.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.380
A teaspoon.

41:07.380 --> 41:10.980
You know, like a healthy teaspoon, if I'm like.

41:10.980 --> 41:11.820
Yeah.

41:13.820 --> 41:15.860
Like, you know, I just like.

41:15.860 --> 41:17.620
Bequeathing teaspoon.

41:17.620 --> 41:18.460
Bequeathing.

41:19.740 --> 41:24.740
Proffering, proffering a healthy dose of medicine.

41:24.740 --> 41:26.260
But choose nothing.

41:27.260 --> 41:29.260
Bequeathing a teaspoon.

41:31.020 --> 41:32.660
You know what's a cool word?

41:32.660 --> 41:33.580
Slake.

41:34.460 --> 41:35.380
Like a thirst?

41:35.380 --> 41:37.460
Yeah, that's the only thing that gets slaked.

41:37.460 --> 41:38.300
Yeah.

41:38.300 --> 41:39.140
Pretty cool word.

41:39.140 --> 41:39.980
Yeah, can you slake anything else?

41:39.980 --> 41:40.960
I don't think you can slake anything.

41:40.960 --> 41:41.860
I mean, it probably can.

41:41.860 --> 41:42.700
English is a no wrong answer.

41:42.700 --> 41:43.700
You can slake a thirst.

41:43.700 --> 41:47.380
But can you slake a dragon or a football?

41:47.380 --> 41:49.100
You could slake a dragon of thirst.

41:51.460 --> 41:53.300
You slake the dragon of thirst, yeah.

41:53.300 --> 41:58.300
That's Sprite's new Super Bowl halftime show, slogan.

41:59.820 --> 42:01.660
Slake the dragon of thirst.

42:03.900 --> 42:05.860
Heather Ann, how's it going on?

42:05.860 --> 42:07.940
How did this get played?

42:07.940 --> 42:08.940
It's going well.

42:09.900 --> 42:11.540
We had to cancel our London show today

42:11.540 --> 42:12.860
and it made me real sad.

42:12.860 --> 42:15.020
Damn, when was the London show?

42:15.020 --> 42:16.700
It was this Saturday.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.820
Is that gonna, wait, no, that's not London Comic-Con

42:19.820 --> 42:20.660
or anything like that.

42:20.660 --> 42:22.540
No, it's London Podcast Festival.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.740
Why, why did you cancel?

42:26.860 --> 42:27.940
Secret?

42:27.940 --> 42:28.780
Brexit.

42:28.780 --> 42:29.620
Huh?

42:29.620 --> 42:30.460
Brexit.

42:30.460 --> 42:31.300
Brexit.

42:31.300 --> 42:36.300
No, I don't know what the official reason

42:39.900 --> 42:43.420
that was put out was, but my co-host fell ill

42:43.420 --> 42:46.660
so we can't go and I hope he gets better.

42:46.660 --> 42:49.500
But I was super bummed out because I love London.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.580
Yeah, that's the best.

42:50.580 --> 42:51.820
Yeah, it's fucking great.

42:51.820 --> 42:53.140
Who's the co-host?

42:53.140 --> 42:54.260
Nick Weiger.

42:54.260 --> 42:55.100
Nick Weiger, from-

42:55.100 --> 42:56.260
Oh, the sick guy?

42:56.260 --> 42:57.100
Yes.

42:58.660 --> 42:59.500
Sick guy.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.500
Sick Weiger, yeah.

43:01.500 --> 43:04.780
But yeah, he fell ill so we can't go and, you know.

43:04.780 --> 43:06.540
I wonder if there's like some insurance reason

43:06.540 --> 43:08.380
why that had to be a secret and now he's fucked.

43:08.380 --> 43:11.460
I think it was, the thing was that he,

43:11.460 --> 43:13.900
I don't think he wanted, you know,

43:13.900 --> 43:16.660
he didn't want to take all the ire for it,

43:16.660 --> 43:18.140
but I just did that, so.

43:18.140 --> 43:21.580
Oh, I see, he didn't want it to be because of him.

43:21.580 --> 43:25.660
Yeah, yeah, but now, you know, now they know.

43:25.660 --> 43:26.500
It was Nick.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.740
Have you been having fun playing a bad video game?

43:28.740 --> 43:32.660
That show is fun when we're recording

43:32.660 --> 43:35.020
and it's really miserable the rest of the time.

43:35.020 --> 43:36.300
Because you're having a research.

43:36.300 --> 43:38.220
Yeah, so I play, on Sundays,

43:38.220 --> 43:41.780
I play like maybe four, five to eight hours

43:41.780 --> 43:44.980
of a terrible video game and that's my schedule,

43:44.980 --> 43:47.940
my scheduled time to do the thing for the podcast

43:47.940 --> 43:51.300
and take a bunch of notes and I've had to give up

43:51.300 --> 43:54.980
like good video games, I can't play any good ones,

43:54.980 --> 43:56.180
I just play shit.

43:56.180 --> 43:59.620
I can't help but think that that sounds a little fun.

43:59.620 --> 44:01.340
We thought it would be.

44:01.340 --> 44:04.060
And then our first episode in, after the tape,

44:04.060 --> 44:07.300
Nick was like, I think we have miscalculated.

44:09.300 --> 44:10.660
How do you pick the games?

44:10.660 --> 44:13.300
You seek out games you know are going to be bad?

44:13.300 --> 44:16.660
Yeah, so either like via, if there's like a theme,

44:16.660 --> 44:18.540
then it'll be like a Metacritic,

44:18.540 --> 44:21.980
like what's the worst game in this genre?

44:21.980 --> 44:25.020
Today was, the episode was about Seaman,

44:25.020 --> 44:27.540
the Dreamcast virtual pet,

44:27.540 --> 44:29.180
because today is the 20th anniversary

44:29.180 --> 44:31.660
of the release of the Dreamcast.

44:31.660 --> 44:33.580
So we picked that game, it sucked.

44:35.060 --> 44:37.100
They're all so bad.

44:37.100 --> 44:37.940
Seaman.

44:37.940 --> 44:38.780
Seaman.

44:38.780 --> 44:39.620
Seaman is a.

44:39.620 --> 44:41.020
Colin, dropping loads.

44:41.020 --> 44:41.860
Yeah.

44:41.860 --> 44:45.180
They really leaned into it with the press

44:45.180 --> 44:48.620
or the advertisements, are you taking off?

44:48.620 --> 44:49.460
He'll be back.

44:49.460 --> 44:50.780
You're gonna, you gotta go?

44:50.780 --> 44:51.780
I have to go to the bathroom.

44:51.780 --> 44:52.620
Oh, okay.

44:53.900 --> 44:54.740
I drank too much.

44:54.740 --> 44:56.180
Are you gonna drop loads?

44:58.620 --> 44:59.460
All right.

44:59.460 --> 45:00.940
Are you gonna come into the toilet?

45:00.940 --> 45:09.940
Don't get a turd, Pregnant.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.540
If you do, bring it on stage.

45:20.540 --> 45:21.380
Yeah.

45:22.660 --> 45:25.820
Seaman notable for having a microphone peripheral,

45:25.820 --> 45:26.660
am I mistaken?

45:26.660 --> 45:28.260
Yeah, there was a microphone that you snapped

45:28.260 --> 45:29.980
into the controller and the only way to interact

45:29.980 --> 45:31.340
with the game was to talk to it.

45:31.340 --> 45:33.060
No, not the only way.

45:33.060 --> 45:33.900
Yeah.

45:33.900 --> 45:34.940
Like go left, go right.

45:34.940 --> 45:36.260
You can't, there is no go left.

45:36.260 --> 45:37.420
There's only talking to Seaman.

45:37.420 --> 45:39.020
There's only talking.

45:39.020 --> 45:40.060
It fucking sucks.

45:40.060 --> 45:42.060
I'm telling you, it fucking blows.

45:42.060 --> 45:43.380
Because it's Dreamcast.

45:43.380 --> 45:44.820
What year is this from?

45:44.820 --> 45:47.260
Like 2000, 1999, somewhere in there.

45:47.260 --> 45:48.460
And you have to talk to it and say,

45:48.460 --> 45:49.300
go here or go there?

45:49.300 --> 45:50.260
No, you just talked.

45:50.260 --> 45:51.100
No.

45:51.100 --> 45:51.940
It doesn't go anywhere.

45:51.940 --> 45:52.780
It doesn't go anywhere.

45:52.780 --> 45:53.620
You just have breakfast?

45:53.620 --> 45:54.460
What is it?

45:54.460 --> 45:55.300
It grows up.

45:55.300 --> 45:57.020
It grows up and then you talk to it

45:57.020 --> 45:59.580
and asks you questions and remembers your answers.

45:59.580 --> 46:00.420
And then it-

46:00.420 --> 46:01.940
Why is he Seaman?

46:01.940 --> 46:02.900
Because he's a fish.

46:02.900 --> 46:07.380
Fish with a human face, a bald man's face.

46:07.380 --> 46:08.220
Pretty unattractive.

46:08.220 --> 46:10.020
I'm telling you, the show is a nightmare.

46:11.520 --> 46:13.700
A grown ass man?

46:13.700 --> 46:17.540
Yeah, a grown human man's face and the fish body.

46:17.540 --> 46:20.340
And it's like a baby though with a grown man's face.

46:20.340 --> 46:22.580
What style of animation or like-

46:22.580 --> 46:23.420
What?

46:23.420 --> 46:24.740
Wait, what?

46:24.740 --> 46:26.740
What are the visuals like on this?

46:26.740 --> 46:27.580
Like what does it look like?

46:27.580 --> 46:30.300
So it's like you're looking at a fish tank

46:30.300 --> 46:32.740
and in the fish tank is a fish with a human face.

46:32.740 --> 46:33.860
Was it the 3D kind of thing?

46:33.860 --> 46:34.700
Or is it the 3D?

46:34.700 --> 46:36.620
No, it's PS1 graphics, PS2.

46:36.620 --> 46:37.660
It's PS2 era.

46:37.660 --> 46:40.300
I love that there has to be a tank in the video game

46:40.300 --> 46:42.700
to keep the fish from escaping.

46:42.700 --> 46:43.580
The video game.

46:43.580 --> 46:44.660
Well, it's-

46:44.660 --> 46:47.300
And so is there an end game where you just interact

46:47.300 --> 46:48.140
with this fish?

46:48.140 --> 46:49.940
You interact with it until it becomes an adult

46:49.940 --> 46:51.020
and then it goes away.

46:54.300 --> 46:56.220
It's a metaphor for childbirth.

46:56.220 --> 47:00.500
Wait, it goes away and then it scrolls credits?

47:00.500 --> 47:01.340
Yeah.

47:01.340 --> 47:02.180
Yes.

47:02.180 --> 47:03.020
You start the game over.

47:03.020 --> 47:04.460
Yes, that's for real.

47:04.460 --> 47:05.420
That's for real.

47:05.420 --> 47:08.340
And Thanksgiving comes back with a horrible girlfriend.

47:08.340 --> 47:11.580
It's a polysine major.

47:11.580 --> 47:15.860
It's just problematizing every fucking thing in the table.

47:15.860 --> 47:17.540
Does the fish talk back to you?

47:17.540 --> 47:18.380
Yes.

47:18.380 --> 47:21.900
And what does it sound like?

47:21.900 --> 47:22.860
It's like-

47:22.860 --> 47:23.700
David Press.

47:23.700 --> 47:25.900
It's like here, I'll do my best impression.

47:25.900 --> 47:32.900
It's like, so how are you doing today?

47:32.900 --> 47:34.620
Oh.

47:34.620 --> 47:40.020
I'm asking you, like that, it's got a fucking attitude.

47:40.020 --> 47:41.900
And do you have, is it like Sims?

47:41.900 --> 47:44.620
If you don't talk to it, it dies or do you have to-

47:44.620 --> 47:47.620
If you don't talk to it, it gets stupid.

47:47.620 --> 47:50.100
So what winning is it going away?

47:50.100 --> 47:52.180
I guess it's like-

47:52.180 --> 47:55.020
I would imagine losing is it just stays

47:55.020 --> 47:57.980
on eventually mass shoots and blames you in its letter.

48:01.580 --> 48:03.900
Too soon?

48:03.900 --> 48:07.660
There's one a week for the last 10 years.

48:07.660 --> 48:10.700
I tried, when I was playing it for the show,

48:10.700 --> 48:13.940
I found a list of all the words that it recognized.

48:13.940 --> 48:16.780
And I just was reading the list to it

48:16.780 --> 48:18.980
to try and hack its intelligence to make it

48:18.980 --> 48:21.580
like as smart as possible right away.

48:21.580 --> 48:26.860
And that was not satisfying for either of us.

48:26.860 --> 48:28.740
It's the worst way to play a bad game.

48:28.740 --> 48:31.140
How does Seaman let you know that he's

48:31.140 --> 48:35.300
unsatisfied with your course of action?

48:35.300 --> 48:39.260
Because he really is irritated all the time.

48:39.260 --> 48:41.500
Like it's not a pleasant experience.

48:41.500 --> 48:43.620
So I'm picturing the most uncomfortable thing.

48:43.620 --> 48:45.940
I'm having anxiety right now just thinking about it.

48:45.940 --> 48:49.340
I'm picturing a grown man's head.

48:49.340 --> 48:50.940
That's right, body.

48:50.940 --> 48:53.740
That's like- it sounds like a David Lynch movie.

48:53.740 --> 48:56.540
If I go on my phone right now and type in Seaman,

48:56.540 --> 48:57.540
will I find Seaman?

48:57.540 --> 49:00.300
Yeah, yeah.

49:00.300 --> 49:04.380
It's giving me flashbacks to this potentially traumatizing

49:04.380 --> 49:06.540
memory I had when I visited my sister's hospital.

49:06.540 --> 49:10.540
And I believe I shared on this podcast.

49:10.540 --> 49:12.420
And I went and I remember going wandering around

49:12.420 --> 49:13.340
my sister's hospital.

49:13.340 --> 49:15.340
She was institutionalized for Rhett Syndrome.

49:15.340 --> 49:19.740
And it was a big state-funded building.

49:19.740 --> 49:22.420
Oh, it's so much worse than I thought.

49:22.420 --> 49:23.860
This is really gross.

49:23.860 --> 49:26.420
And I happened to find this grown man in a crib.

49:26.420 --> 49:27.380
I was like eight years old.

49:27.380 --> 49:29.180
I'm peering into a crib because I just

49:29.180 --> 49:32.540
hear this sound of a guy going, moo, moo, moo, moo.

49:32.540 --> 49:35.980
And then I looked in and it was just a grown-ass man

49:35.980 --> 49:40.260
with a mustache and a hot comb to like quaffed haircut.

49:40.260 --> 49:43.500
Like somebody would come by and take real good care of him.

49:43.500 --> 49:45.540
Like he looked like a handsome movie actor,

49:45.540 --> 49:46.820
but he was in a diaper.

49:46.820 --> 49:50.660
And he was calling out for his squeaky cow toy.

49:50.660 --> 49:55.740
And so when I think of a grown adult man in a fish body

49:55.740 --> 50:00.060
and him, yeah, I'm seeing it from a distance here.

50:00.060 --> 50:00.740
It's not good.

50:00.740 --> 50:01.260
Yeah.

50:01.260 --> 50:02.740
You can hand the phone down.

50:02.740 --> 50:03.820
I don't know about that.

50:03.820 --> 50:05.180
Yeah, pass it along.

50:05.180 --> 50:08.940
It looks like a life.

50:08.940 --> 50:10.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:10.340 --> 50:15.860
So he's designed to look like the customer.

50:15.860 --> 50:16.900
Of course.

50:16.900 --> 50:21.060
I mean, it looks like a gamer.

50:21.060 --> 50:24.460
Yeah, a circa 1999 gamer.

50:24.460 --> 50:26.380
He just swims around and just harangues you?

50:26.380 --> 50:27.380
Yeah, yeah.

50:27.380 --> 50:30.060
And makes you feel bad for not being a good friend?

50:30.060 --> 50:32.780
No, I mean, he'll be entertained once in a while.

50:32.780 --> 50:35.340
And how does he express entertainment?

50:35.340 --> 50:36.300
That's funny.

50:39.100 --> 50:41.460
He did say something that really surprised me.

50:41.460 --> 50:45.140
And I think I talked about this on our podcast.

50:45.140 --> 50:48.060
And here I am talking about it again.

50:48.060 --> 50:51.340
So when we were playing it, because we played in a room

50:51.340 --> 50:53.380
with a few people.

50:53.380 --> 50:57.620
And at some point, he was like, so do you have a boyfriend?

50:57.620 --> 50:58.860
And I was like, no.

50:58.860 --> 51:00.820
And he went, let me get this straight.

51:00.820 --> 51:02.220
You do not have a boyfriend.

51:02.220 --> 51:02.980
And I went, no.

51:02.980 --> 51:05.060
And he goes, do you have a girlfriend?

51:05.060 --> 51:05.860
And I went, yes.

51:05.860 --> 51:07.740
And he goes, ah.

51:07.740 --> 51:12.460
Well, it must be hard being in a marginalized group

51:12.460 --> 51:15.940
inside of a marginalized portion of the population.

51:15.940 --> 51:16.860
Wait, whoa.

51:16.860 --> 51:24.780
And I was like, wait, so I can't tell.

51:24.780 --> 51:27.380
Is that woke or is that not woke?

51:27.380 --> 51:30.540
I mean, for 1999, it's super woke.

51:30.540 --> 51:32.140
He wasn't nice.

51:32.140 --> 51:36.460
It's also super sophisticated from a Turing's perspective.

51:36.460 --> 51:39.100
How much information had you given it?

51:39.100 --> 51:44.260
I had talked about it in my family and my job.

51:44.260 --> 51:45.580
Like it knew enough about it.

51:45.580 --> 51:47.980
But when it said this, everybody in the room

51:47.980 --> 51:52.260
was like, Jesus Christ.

51:52.260 --> 51:53.500
Turn it off.

51:53.500 --> 51:54.940
It's unplugged from the wall.

51:59.540 --> 52:02.580
Well, I mean, I know you've probably heard this already,

52:02.580 --> 52:05.260
but I think most of us are listening to this

52:05.260 --> 52:09.980
and going, well, that sounds rad, both as an episode

52:09.980 --> 52:11.820
and as a game and as a job.

52:11.820 --> 52:13.540
But you're giving us the highlights.

52:13.540 --> 52:14.220
Yeah, yeah.

52:14.220 --> 52:14.860
It's torture.

52:14.860 --> 52:19.340
Yeah, but there was, in order to play it with the guest,

52:19.340 --> 52:21.940
I had to keep one alive.

52:21.940 --> 52:25.380
And the morning of the show, it died.

52:25.380 --> 52:28.980
I turned it on and it floated up to the top of the tank.

52:28.980 --> 52:29.500
Wait, wait.

52:29.500 --> 52:30.100
It can die.

52:30.100 --> 52:31.060
Yeah, it can die.

52:31.060 --> 52:33.820
If you don't like, because you have to maintain it.

52:33.820 --> 52:37.300
Internal clock on the system regulates how often you feed it

52:37.300 --> 52:39.820
and you have to keep the temperature on the water tank.

52:39.820 --> 52:41.220
Like it's a lot of fucking shit.

52:41.220 --> 52:43.020
It's like a fancy, what do you call it?

52:43.020 --> 52:43.780
Tamagotchi?

52:43.780 --> 52:44.740
Tamagotchi, yeah.

52:44.740 --> 52:47.860
It's like the reason we all play video games

52:47.860 --> 52:50.380
to get away from it.

52:50.380 --> 52:52.300
It's a human relationship.

52:52.300 --> 52:56.460
So that was why, that day, I had to power level it

52:56.460 --> 52:59.380
by just reading all of the words that it

52:59.380 --> 53:01.100
knew from an internet guy.

53:01.100 --> 53:02.860
But it didn't dig it?

53:02.860 --> 53:04.020
No, it didn't.

53:04.020 --> 53:06.340
Well, that sounds satanic.

53:06.340 --> 53:09.300
You had to resurrect it by reciting words

53:09.300 --> 53:11.020
that it knew in its death.

53:11.020 --> 53:11.980
No, I had it.

53:11.980 --> 53:19.500
Tennis, satanum, dominus, Play-Doh, lesbian.

53:19.500 --> 53:21.740
Remember me?

53:21.740 --> 53:22.820
It's me.

53:22.820 --> 53:24.980
Wait, did you name it or is he always named Seaman?

53:24.980 --> 53:26.540
You know, you can name him.

53:26.540 --> 53:27.580
What did you name your Seaman?

53:27.580 --> 53:30.980
Well, I named my Seaman, I named him Nick.

53:30.980 --> 53:34.700
So that, because I thought that would make Nick uncomfortable.

53:34.700 --> 53:35.780
Did it?

53:35.780 --> 53:36.500
Yes, it did.

53:36.500 --> 53:37.020
Hell yeah.

53:37.020 --> 53:39.100
Yeah.

53:39.100 --> 53:39.860
But yeah, that was.

53:39.860 --> 53:44.700
Did it ever bring back that you're gay or that you're

53:44.700 --> 53:45.500
lesbian?

53:45.500 --> 53:46.980
Did it ever, like, like?

53:46.980 --> 53:48.060
Yeah, he remembered it.

53:48.060 --> 53:49.820
Did it ever lured that over you in any way?

53:49.820 --> 53:51.540
No, Lord, no.

53:51.540 --> 53:54.220
Lured it over.

53:54.220 --> 53:55.660
No, he'd remembered it, though, later

53:55.660 --> 53:58.660
and was like, so how is your girlfriend?

53:58.660 --> 54:01.140
And I'm like, she's fine, is she there?

54:01.140 --> 54:02.500
And I was like, no.

54:02.500 --> 54:03.980
And it's like, too bad.

54:03.980 --> 54:05.020
So I have a shot?

54:09.820 --> 54:10.980
That's so fucked up.

54:10.980 --> 54:12.460
Yeah, it's super fucked up.

54:12.460 --> 54:17.460
That's really, I played Sims for a while, and I hated it.

54:17.460 --> 54:23.500
It made me feel like a lot of weird anxiety.

54:23.500 --> 54:25.700
Because if you, there's just all of a sudden,

54:25.700 --> 54:27.180
there's flies in the kitchen.

54:27.180 --> 54:27.620
Yeah.

54:27.620 --> 54:29.980
Because you didn't do.

54:29.980 --> 54:33.700
I don't get stuff that you can neglect as part of a game.

54:33.700 --> 54:35.300
That freaks me the fuck out.

54:35.300 --> 54:37.860
I'm like, I am here to neglect my life.

54:37.860 --> 54:39.860
And then they just start walking into a wall

54:39.860 --> 54:41.220
and banging their head against the wall

54:41.220 --> 54:43.340
and sobbing in weird computer gibberish.

54:43.340 --> 54:44.340
Yeah.

54:44.340 --> 54:44.840
Yeah.

54:44.840 --> 54:46.940
That's my favorite part.

54:46.940 --> 54:49.140
I don't mind things that paying attention to them

54:49.140 --> 54:50.540
makes them grow.

54:50.540 --> 54:53.540
Like, I'll literally just grow fucking plants

54:53.540 --> 54:56.020
on some iPad game for a year.

54:56.020 --> 54:59.540
But the idea of them wilting or getting weeds

54:59.540 --> 55:04.420
because I didn't do enough, it's a deal breaker for me.

55:04.420 --> 55:07.420
And it's crazy the shit that's not a deal breaker for me.

55:07.420 --> 55:14.540
Especially in these soccer mom games that I play now.

55:14.540 --> 55:16.660
The reason your job sounds fun is because at least you're

55:16.660 --> 55:17.620
on a console.

55:17.620 --> 55:19.540
I just have left that life.

55:19.540 --> 55:22.860
I sit in bed and listen to true crime podcasts.

55:22.860 --> 55:26.500
And I just have, by my own volition,

55:26.500 --> 55:28.540
with Cody begging me, please play Minecraft

55:28.540 --> 55:29.740
so I can get some sleep.

55:29.740 --> 55:31.740
I'm just like, I don't know why I have just

55:31.740 --> 55:33.260
circling this drain, where I'm just

55:33.260 --> 55:37.500
playing these increasingly banal games.

55:37.500 --> 55:40.260
I'm playing shop titans now or something, what's called this.

55:40.260 --> 55:43.420
You just run a shop, and you just keep making weapons.

55:43.420 --> 55:46.100
People that are going on adventures that are not

55:46.100 --> 55:48.740
part of the game are coming in, buying weapons from you,

55:48.740 --> 55:52.740
and leaving the game so they can go play a video game.

55:52.740 --> 55:55.180
And my job is to keep the shelves stocked

55:55.180 --> 55:57.260
so I don't disappoint them.

55:57.260 --> 55:58.540
That's how I win.

55:58.540 --> 56:02.100
And what I win is more shelf space.

56:02.100 --> 56:04.140
And I've already put like 20 bucks into it.

56:04.140 --> 56:07.620
Don't even fucking let me kid you.

56:07.620 --> 56:09.740
And I'm like, oh, well, I can't wait

56:09.740 --> 56:12.420
for this wing of my story to be finished.

56:12.420 --> 56:14.700
I'll buy some diamonds.

56:14.700 --> 56:17.500
Anyways, I sound a lot less happy than I am.

56:17.500 --> 56:20.780
So you're like a Forged in Fire guy

56:20.780 --> 56:22.820
that you just make weapons and then people

56:22.820 --> 56:24.020
come into your forge.

56:24.020 --> 56:26.340
The honest to God truth is I'm not even making them there.

56:26.340 --> 56:27.700
I'm actually subcontracting.

56:27.700 --> 56:30.220
There's other kids.

56:30.220 --> 56:33.900
I just run a store, that's it.

56:33.900 --> 56:36.380
There's a woman that makes all the magic stuff.

56:36.380 --> 56:38.500
There's a guy that makes all of the.

56:38.500 --> 56:40.740
So you're just like the, you're not even the barista.

56:40.740 --> 56:42.340
You're just the run in the cashier.

56:42.340 --> 56:43.900
Yeah, like your management.

56:43.900 --> 56:49.140
Yeah, I'm like a, I'm absolutely unnecessary.

56:49.140 --> 56:51.340
In a proper society, I wouldn't exist.

56:51.340 --> 56:54.180
I am what Lenin probably called the bourgeois.

56:54.180 --> 56:55.780
I was like, what am I?

56:55.780 --> 56:57.380
I'm a parasite.

56:57.380 --> 56:58.460
Yeah, bourgeoisie.

57:02.460 --> 57:03.180
So now.

57:03.180 --> 57:05.260
That game sounds like a great one for the podcast.

57:08.860 --> 57:10.580
The appeal for you, Dan, is what?

57:10.580 --> 57:12.700
The lack of responsibility?

57:12.700 --> 57:13.460
There's no appeal.

57:13.460 --> 57:18.660
It's a hamster bottle filled with dopamine spikes.

57:18.660 --> 57:21.460
You're just like lapping at it out of habit.

57:21.460 --> 57:23.420
Because the last time I laughed at it,

57:23.420 --> 57:25.300
a thing slid up and said five.

57:25.300 --> 57:27.940
And I want to see it say six.

57:27.940 --> 57:30.900
The engineers that make these games have figured it out.

57:30.900 --> 57:33.460
There is, it's a nicotine patch.

57:33.460 --> 57:36.100
It's a tobacco pouch.

57:36.100 --> 57:39.140
It's fucking, it's a sharp toothpick.

57:39.140 --> 57:42.820
You keep picking at the bloody gum with.

57:42.820 --> 57:44.580
It's a fucking, it's cutting.

57:44.580 --> 57:48.580
That sounds great.

57:48.580 --> 57:52.580
I'm playing a game kind of like that called merge dragons.

57:52.580 --> 57:54.580
Yes, I know where it's the worst.

57:54.580 --> 57:56.580
It's the worst game that I've ever played.

57:56.580 --> 57:58.580
I went through a merge phase.

57:58.580 --> 57:59.580
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

57:59.580 --> 58:01.580
It seems like the kind of like it's like.

58:01.580 --> 58:02.580
I don't like those games.

58:02.580 --> 58:05.580
I like mechanics that are real, but boy howdy.

58:05.580 --> 58:10.580
When you drag three rocks or if you're lucky five rocks together

58:10.580 --> 58:15.580
and they become a bigger rock, it's like oh damn.

58:15.580 --> 58:19.580
Yeah, but I've had days ruined where I go to drag five rocks together

58:19.580 --> 58:22.580
and I accidentally only drag three rocks together.

58:22.580 --> 58:26.580
Oh man, like my stomach just sinks like I'm about to get in a car wreck.

58:26.580 --> 58:30.580
It's there's some highs and lows in merge dragons.

58:30.580 --> 58:32.580
It's the only genre of game.

58:32.580 --> 58:35.580
I think like this should be a tip off to us that it's not.

58:35.580 --> 58:39.580
It's like there's no way to parody that style of game like you couldn't.

58:39.580 --> 58:43.580
We did a joke game a million years ago that was like called Jerry's game.

58:43.580 --> 58:47.580
It was like Jerry was playing it in the thing and there's an actual game called Jerry's game.

58:47.580 --> 58:49.580
It's just a bunch of balloons and you just pop them.

58:49.580 --> 58:52.580
But there are still a thousand people out there popping the fucking balloons.

58:52.580 --> 58:55.580
And I won't go near it because I'm afraid one will be me.

58:55.580 --> 58:59.580
And just think like I want to pop a million balloons.

58:59.580 --> 59:07.580
And you can't therefore like famously some of the most successful game designers.

59:07.580 --> 59:11.580
Like wasn't the flappy bird guy like doing it as a bit or something.

59:11.580 --> 59:13.580
Yeah, I think flappy bird was a bit.

59:13.580 --> 59:20.580
There's like a lot of stories about people like going like so what if I just do this like people will play it.

59:20.580 --> 59:22.580
And the answer is yes.

59:22.580 --> 59:25.580
Like because they bother to put like this aesthetic into it.

59:25.580 --> 59:28.580
I think it's just colors and sounds and things.

59:28.580 --> 59:30.580
It all comes down to just this feel.

59:30.580 --> 59:36.580
It's a slot machine feel it's like like you when you merge those dragons when you water that plant.

59:36.580 --> 59:38.580
There's just certain textural experience.

59:38.580 --> 59:42.580
That's why they tell you to put your phone in grayscale because we're primates.

59:42.580 --> 59:45.580
Those brains are designed to find ripe fruit.

59:45.580 --> 59:58.580
Like we if we can locate things that look right and feel right and we can walk backward in our brains to eliminate the most amount of work possible to get that lemon.

59:58.580 --> 01:00:02.580
We reward ourselves with heroin that we generate in our own brain.

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:05.580
And we are all Keith Richards at this point.

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:08.580
That would be awesome to make a satirical version of the game.

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.580
Like it would probably be very hard but like super awesome.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:18.580
How would you I mean you know is it just like pocket Morty's not a satire and is it not I mean I got addicted to that game.

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:27.580
Like I really want to do an incremental clicker for Rick and Morty because I mean like the idea of prestigeing fitting in with timelines and stuff but whatever.

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:32.580
Do you think there's a game that you could design that could end civilization?

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:37.580
Like because all this stuff you just said is I think pretty correct.

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:48.580
But I feel like somebody with maybe without a moral center could harness all of those things and like really because like Pokemon Go kind of stopped everyone for a summer.

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.580
Right.

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.580
Right.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:54.580
Like everybody stopped doing the like we everybody would.

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:55.580
Oh man.

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:56.580
Yeah, I got it.

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:57.580
Okay.

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.580
So Pokemon Go except it just makes people go to locations that are like away from a bank or something.

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:08.580
And then you just rob the bank or commit crimes that are synchronized towards where you're directing these people.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:09.580
Yeah.

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.580
You can take over the world.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:17.580
There was I think it's like a rerun but this is semantically but I think thematically related.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:24.580
The current thing that's up in the rotation for Radio Lab is about this British game show.

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:27.580
That's basically the Prisoner's Dilemma.

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.580
It's called Golden Balls.

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.580
And it's just the Prisoner's Dilemma.

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:31.580
You know what that is.

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:32.580
No.

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:38.580
In the final round of this game what they do is they give the two finalists a pair of Golden Balls.

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:40.580
One says Split.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:42.580
The other says Steel on it.

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:47.580
If they both talk to each other about promising which one they're going to do.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:54.580
If they both choose to split, they split the jackpot.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:02:00.580
If one of them chooses to split and the other one chooses to steal, the person that steals gets 100% of the money.

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:04.580
If they both choose to steal, they get nothing both of them.

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:11.580
So the constant thing is like why would you ever choose to split?

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:20.580
Even if you're not a bad person, you're so afraid of being fucked that you may as well preemptively try to fuck the other person.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:25.580
It's kind of like what the Prisoner's Dilemma is which is the technique that cops use to separate suspects and they say,

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:28.580
your friend's in the other room telling me that you robbed the bank, what do you think?

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.580
And they'll get false confessions that way, little and real ones.

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:39.580
Because what are you supposed to do if you can't see your friend and go, let's just both tell them they got nothing?

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:46.580
And the story is about a guy who was like a game show expert who's been on like 46 game shows and he went on the show

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:55.580
and kind of broke it by saying to the other guy, listen, I promise you I'm going to steal.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:04.580
So if you say split, I'll get all the money and I'll split it with you after the show.

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:12.580
But the guy was like, they argued for an hour and the audience was booing the guy because he was just doing it wrong.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:18.580
He was meta and it was like, but also he wasn't negotiating.

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:27.580
He was simply saying, I'm drawing a hard line, I promise you I'm going to do the bad thing, therefore you can bank on it.

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:39.580
If you also steal, we both get nothing, you may as well choose split because it was the practical way to kind of beat the game.

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:46.580
And also then I think as an added fuck you to the game, the guy chose split, the other guy.

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:53.580
And then the hero guy also chose split, so they just split the money after doing all that for hours.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.580
I think he just decided that would be extra hilarious.

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:04.580
But the other guy, this is what's interesting to me, the other guy said in his post kind of interview about it,

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:08.580
he talks about how upset he was with this other guy, he's not listening to me,

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:11.580
it's like here's my big time at this game show that's been running for three seasons,

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:16.580
this is the thing, you promise the other person you play this game, you lock these horns,

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:20.580
and the guy's just like fucking laying out this meta bullshit and he won't listen to fucking reason,

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:28.580
it is making me really upset. But in the end, the guy chose split and by his full honest admission after the fact,

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:32.580
he's like, oh yeah, I was definitely going to steal, no matter what.

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.580
But that's the one thing he didn't do.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:43.580
In other words, the guy chose the only behavior that changed another person whose attitude about the world was predetermined.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:50.580
The only behavior was, I would call it honesty again, but whatever, I don't know if that's related.

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:57.580
As far as a game that could shut down civilization, it's interesting to me that just in terms of game theory,

01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:04.580
there always is this odd meta choice that you can use to just short circuit everything.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:11.580
It's kind of what people who would be stoked about Trump's election would say that that's what his election was.

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:17.580
Well, let's just elect the fucking, like, the unelectable.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.580
Like, why are we even doing this anymore?

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:23.580
Like, okay, I'll choose that.

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:28.580
Like, let's shut this Mountain Dew contest down, you know.

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:32.580
Let's shut this Mountain Dew contest down.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.580
And now we're all so happy.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.580
Yeah.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.580
We've been liberated.

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:42.580
I was blackout drunk last time you were around, but like...

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.580
Did you listen to the episode afterwards?

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:46.580
No.

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.580
Oh, great.

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:48.580
I don't want to listen to that.

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:53.580
I'm a fucking drunk guy trying to have a show he can't handle.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:06:04.580
But did I ask for your permission and or share the thing you told me about the election when you told me that you did the thing

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:06.580
and then you took a picture and then you did the thing?

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.580
I don't think we talked about that.

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.580
I don't...

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:11.580
I don't remember...

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:12.580
Are you opposed to sharing that?

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.580
No, no.

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.580
I'm totally...

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.580
This is like...

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:19.580
This will ruin the thing, but I'll talk about the thing.

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.580
Wait, what ruin what thing?

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:22.580
If I say what I did...

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:23.580
Holy shit.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.580
It won't work.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.580
Oh, it won't work?

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.580
Yes, yes, I know, I know.

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.580
But I'll say the thing.

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:33.580
It's kind of worth it because until we all die, you'll...

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.580
Like, I'm in awe of you.

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.580
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:44.580
This isn't the most tantalizing enigmatic...

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:53.580
When the election was between Hillary and Trump and the others, I went to my voting place.

01:06:53.580 --> 01:07:02.580
I was so scared that Trump was going to win, that I went to my voting place and I voted for Trump,

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:07.580
took a photo of it with my phone, took out the thing, brought the ballot up and I went,

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.580
I'm sorry, I made a mistake, can I have another ballot?

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:17.580
They threw that ballot out and then I got another ballot and then voted correctly so that if they come to my door

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:25.580
and they're like, you know, the jackboots are there, I'll be able to pull out my phone

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:30.580
and be like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.580
That was the actual motivation for that?

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:33.580
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:34.580
Really?

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.580
Really.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:36.580
Self-preservation.

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:37.580
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:38.580
It wasn't just a bit, like, this will be hilarious to my friends.

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.580
No, no, it was, I haven't ever shown...

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.580
This will get you out of Montana one day.

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.580
Yeah, I haven't showed it.

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:44.580
That's fucking cynical.

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:48.580
And now, now it's over.

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:52.580
They will, they'll be like, no, we listened.

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.580
We love Harmontown.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:55.580
They do.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.580
We're hip to that jive.

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:06.580
Then I will say, yes, but that was a liberal audience, so I had to tell them that I ended up throwing the ballot away,

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:10.580
but really I was so proud of my vote and they'll say, you said that on the podcast.

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:13.580
Right.

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:20.580
I like that you're endowing the Trump faction with forethought and wisdom of any kind.

01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:27.580
I just sabotaged you out of jealousy because when I'm in the firing line, I don't want to be like, fucking Heather, like...

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.580
I want you next to me.

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:31.580
I mean, that's the only really fun thing about getting shot by Nazis.

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:36.580
Or is this just your way, Heather, of trying to cover your ass because you actually voted for Trump?

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:39.580
But she wouldn't have had to explain that.

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.580
No, no, no, she was.

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.580
She's being like three steps ahead of the camera.

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:51.580
Oh, because her phone got hacked by moveon.org zealots and she's afraid that any day now that she knows what's in her photo roll.

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.580
Yeah, that's my...

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:55.580
Oh, god damn it, that photo I took when I proudly voted for Trump.

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.580
I also made a lot of money on the election.

01:08:58.580 --> 01:08:59.580
You did?

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:09.580
Yeah, because I was so sure he was going to win that the February prior to the election, there's a website called PredictIt where you can gamble on politics.

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:18.580
And I was so sure that he was going to win that you could buy... So the way it works is that you buy a share based on the percentage of likelihood that something will happen.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:29.580
So if the payout is a dollar and it's 11% likely that a thing will happen, you buy each share for 11 cents and then it cashes out at a dollar if the thing happens.

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:35.580
And so I bought a lot of Trump at 11 cents because I was like, he's definitely going to win.

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:36.580
How much do you make?

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:42.580
Thousands of dollars, which I left on the exchange because I felt so sick.

01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:47.580
See, I knew he was going to win and I got nothing except just sadness.

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:50.580
He's also going to win next time, everybody, so buckle up.

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:55.580
Jeff, think about it, that website was around when 9-11 happened, huh?

01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.580
Jeff knew 9-11 was going to happen.

01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.580
I didn't know 9-11 was going to happen.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:03.580
Jeff knew it, he was telling people for weeks.

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.580
Rob Schrab, you remember you called me up like...

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:07.580
I called Dan.

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.580
You called me.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.580
Did I?

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:17.580
Yeah, you called me at my place when I lived on Talmadge and you called me up and I'd already had a panic attack because I thought that the world was going to collapse on me and everyone was going to die.

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:24.580
It was my job to pray for people on the other side of the world because a horrible thing was happening and I thought the walls were going to collapse on me.

01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:29.580
And then I finally calmed down after like a half hour of like a full-on panic attack.

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:36.580
And Schrab called me up and he goes, you told me that the World Trade Center tower had gone down.

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.580
The Pentagon got hit.

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.580
You also told me the White House got hit.

01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:45.580
You had some misinformation on that and you said turning your TV right now.

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.580
But it was you that called me and said that it was all going down.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:51.580
So you were having a panic attack before the television was on?

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:58.580
Yes, I woke up and looking back on it, I remember looking at the clock and it was like 9-11.

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.580
6-0.

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.580
My clock said 9.

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.580
Well it was upside down, 6.

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:07.580
It was like 6-0-3 or 6-0-4, whatever it was.

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:13.580
But that was when like 9-0-3 or 9-0-4, whatever it was, is when the second plane hit the tower.

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:20.580
But I just woke up screaming and thought that the walls in my apartment were going to come smashing down on me.

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.580
And I thought I was going to die and I just kept screaming.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:30.580
And then I realized no, it's not me that's in danger, it's people very far away and my job was to pray for them.

01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:37.580
And I finally calmed down after a half hour of just wailing screaming and then Rob caught me up and said turn your TV on.

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.580
And then 9-11.

01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:43.580
If you want to be the new Camille, you can engage this.

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:47.580
Camille was like, are you fucking kidding me?

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.580
You dreamt 9-11?

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:52.580
Wait, can you do a Camille?

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:56.580
My dream is to do a fucking Kumail Nanjiani impression and it's impossible.

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:58.580
Do your best Camille.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.580
No, no, I just did.

01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:02.580
I'm going to walk away with those winnings.

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.580
But keep going.

01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:06.580
I want to learn how to do a Camille.

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:13.580
I had a fucking insane record-breaking nightmare a couple days ago.

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:19.580
You know, sometimes we have these amorphous like dream within a dream kind of things where it's sort of like the ingredients are like,

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:23.580
oh, I didn't know I was asleep, but I kind of felt like in my dream I was asleep or something like that.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.580
But I had a full blown.

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:41.580
Like, I was having a nightmare about like someone being in my house and I woke up like freaking out like,

01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:51.580
like kind of panicked and almost unable to breathe like semi sleep paralysis like coming out of the nightmare and Cody woke up and was like,

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.580
what's wrong?

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:58.580
And I'm like, I just had this crazy fucking nightmare and all this stuff like full on that whole thing.

01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:07.580
And then stayed awake, tried to go back to sleep and then heard more stuff in my house and got up and was walking around that house,

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:18.580
which by the way, was not my house because everything I just described was a nightmare I then woke up from because that was all a dream, bitch.

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.580
All of it.

01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.580
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:25.580
So when I woke up, I was like, I was like, and then I had like genuine like sleep paralysis.

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:29.580
And in my real bed, like, like Cody was like, what's wrong?

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.580
And I'm like, you know what's wrong?

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:35.580
No, you don't know what's wrong because this is a different bed in a different house.

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:44.580
But I was like in a different house that was also unfurnished and wasn't a house I had ever lived in, but was living in with Cody in just a bed,

01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:55.580
but like had no furniture, but it was like a big house and was like scary to walk around when you heard a sound and had this whole fucking nightmare in a nightmare.

01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:57.580
God damn it, you should be more impressed.

01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:01.580
It was like, it was, it was like, it was just cliche.

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:08.580
I mean, like, like it doesn't usually work that way. Like I literally dreamt I was in bed dreaming and didn't know.

01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:11.580
Sometimes you know, you know, like you kind of know, whatever.

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.580
But it was just thought I'd share that.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.580
What are you going to do? Cancel me?

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:21.580
Dan Harmon has been canceled after sharing a double layered nightmare.

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:26.580
Speaking of canceling, I was away on a trip, but apparently this show is coming to an end.

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:33.580
Yeah, we should announce that formally for the vast minority of people who didn't catch Dan's Instagram stream.

01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:37.580
We're going to, we're going to stop, we're going to stop doing the show in December.

01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:40.580
When? Like at the end of December or the first?

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:49.580
Well, probably more the early December since the, we probably won't be around to do shows for, you know, when everybody leaves for, for the holidays.

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.580
So we got some amazing guests coming up to kind of.

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:56.580
Like who? Who are you? Who's coming? Who's coming at a show?

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:57.580
Ed Neumeyer.

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.580
Woo.

01:14:58.580 --> 01:14:59.580
Robocop.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.580
Woo.

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.580
Screenwriter of Robocop.

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:03.580
He didn't play Robocop.

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:04.580
There's silence.

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:05.580
Yep.

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.580
He's refused to come for eight years.

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:09.580
He was like, if you really want me, you'll end the show.

01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.580
We got Laszlo Paniflex.

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:16.580
There's Flula Borg, the famous YouTuber.

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.580
That got a nice, better than Neumeyer.

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:26.580
We got two, two applause, applause from a single individual.

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.580
Dave Foley.

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:30.580
Dave Foley is going to be here.

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:31.580
Let's go.

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.580
Pewdiepie, I think is coming by now.

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:39.580
We're all going to subscribe to him while he's here.

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.580
Or be killed.

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.580
I had a dream. Can I tell you a dream?

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:46.580
Yes.

01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:50.580
I had a dream when I had cancer that blew my fucking mind and gave me a lot of peace.

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:58.580
It was that I lived all the way to the end of my life and was an old woman and was still

01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.580
with my girlfriend, Mary.

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:07.580
We have spoken in the past about how I want to, if uploading your consciousness becomes

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:12.580
a possibility, like if you can dump your load into a computer.

01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:13.580
Drop.

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:14.580
Sorry.

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:15.580
Sorry.

01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.580
God damn it.

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:18.580
Fuck.

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:19.580
Fuck.

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.580
I knew what you meant.

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.580
Fuck.

01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.580
Heather, wake up.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.580
It was all a dream.

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.580
It was all a dream.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:31.580
Because you're a head and a jar.

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:36.580
I dreamt that we got all the way to the old age and we could do it.

01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.580
You can upload your consciousness into a computer.

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:39.580
I was like, I want to do it.

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:41.580
We got a big fight.

01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:43.580
I was like, well, okay, I won't do it.

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:49.580
I'll do it anyway, which will be the way it works.

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:56.580
In the dream, once I was in the computer, my POV of the dream became inside of the computer

01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:57.580
version of me.

01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:05.580
I discovered that your entire life was like an old iPod interface with the scrolling album

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:12.580
covers and that you could go back to any part of your life and click on a thing emotionally,

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:16.580
and replay that experience that you had in your life.

01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:23.580
Then I discovered that you could branch the narrative from within the experience to see

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:26.580
what would have happened if you'd made other choices.

01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:33.580
Then realized that when we talk about the reality is a simulation, that it's not a grand

01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:40.580
simulation for all users, but that each user is simulating their memories of the universe

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:45.580
and making different choices over and over again, getting all the way to the end, realizing

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:49.580
you're still in a computer and then playing the game from that point all the way backwards.

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:50.580
Does that make sense?

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:51.580
Yeah, I am.

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.580
That was my dream.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:57.580
Then I was like, oh, so if I die of cancer in this one, I'll just wake up in the computer

01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.580
and then I'll be like, ah, great.

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:04.580
I know this time when I play that I won't fall.

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:09.580
You know what's crazy about downloading your brain into the computer?

01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:14.580
Unless they decide to then kill your body, your brain will also still exist.

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:17.580
It doesn't just pour out of your brain.

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:23.580
It would presumably get copied over rather than literally jammed into a floppy disk.

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:28.580
You just simultaneously exist as this entity on the computer while your body still exists,

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.580
unless, again, a scientist kills it for you.

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.580
Do you think…

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.580
I thought it was cool.

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:39.580
Do you think… this probably is just hokum.

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.580
Why would I pull this out of my ass?

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:42.580
This is all nonsense.

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:46.580
My gut tells me that before we get to…

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:49.580
I'm going to put this bowl on your head and your brain information is going to come out

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:53.580
through a hose and then your brain is just… you can just outpatient walk out and go,

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:54.580
what would you do today?

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:55.580
Oh, I copied my brain.

01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:58.580
It's in a computer right now that the technology will first have to go through a phase where

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:02.580
you absolutely can't get that information without destroying its original vessel.

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:08.580
That it's going to have to like… if it's actually going to pull every bit out of that

01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:11.580
fucking bowl of tapioca, it's got to fucking stir it.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:15.580
And that's stirring your brain is… well, that's what happened to Kennedy.

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:20.580
I mean, you get your brain stirred by bullets.

01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:23.580
Also, other people, too.

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:24.580
Plenty of people.

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:28.580
But I had a conversation at this wedding I was at with a friend.

01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:33.580
I was talking about that Casey Affleck movie where he's got the sheet over him, the ghost

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:34.580
story movie.

01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.580
Have you seen that?

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:36.580
No.

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:37.580
It's really heart-wrenching.

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:40.580
Particularly because it disarms you with this hokey hipster thing.

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.580
It's just Casey Affleck in a sheet.

01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:48.580
It divorces you from the Patrick Swayze mythology of people being ghosts and being green screened

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.580
and going, whoa, my fingers.

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:57.580
And it really forces you psychologically to contemplate one of the more… what I found

01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:02.580
to be the stunning facts of death, which is that were you to die and were you to hang around,

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:11.580
you would be watching your lover not get over you in Spielberg's whatever it was

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.580
with Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter.

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:14.580
Like purple.

01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:22.580
No, that's not… but watching your girlfriend lose her house keys and eat a whole blueberry

01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:26.080
pie because someone told her it was vegan, but then throw it up because she doesn't

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.780
know what to do with herself and people are coming.

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:35.780
But just watching your friends and lovers mourn your passing while you stood there and watched

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:38.220
it just devastated me.

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:44.300
And it made me realize that the thing I fear about death more than, oh my god, I'm going

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:52.060
to die is like, holy shit, what if I don't just go away?

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:55.900
What if I have to think about Cody?

01:20:55.900 --> 01:21:02.260
Like and her having to put all this energy into my loss like, oh, that's the last thing

01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:08.540
I want is for anyone to have to expend fucking tears for me and all this nonsense.

01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:15.100
And then we started talking about like, so if you could avoid that, would you?

01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:19.500
And I posed a hypothetical to her, this friend I was talking to at the wedding where I was

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:25.860
like, so say someone came to you and said today, they said, hey, listen, I'm from

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:29.780
the Umbrella Corporation.

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.900
We have a program called The Seaman.

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:33.900
You'll come back.

01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:41.860
No, I thought like, for whatever reason, we have selected you as a candidate.

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:45.900
We don't know when you're going to die or how you're going to die, but if you die instantly,

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:54.460
if you participate in this program, you may wake up in a hard drive or ideally, maybe let's

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:59.900
say even just in a clone body, like that was a clone of your body, like we were working

01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:00.900
out the kinks.

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:07.260
Hey, Dan, real quick, I'm getting crazy messages that we have a hard out in like 20 seconds.

01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:08.260
All right.

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:09.620
Well, I was just like, yes, I do it.

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:10.620
I do it.

01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:12.900
I do it even though it'd be like fucking pet cemetery.

01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:14.220
We know it would be pet cemetery.

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.100
We know it would be awful, but we'd still do it.

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:17.100
This is what you said.

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.140
Like you, you'd be like, no, I'd never do that.

01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:20.140
Of course we're going to do it.

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:21.140
We're all going to do it.

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:22.140
Yes.

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:27.740
Cliffhanger, let's give it up for Heather Anne Campbell, everybody.

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:29.860
We have a hard out.

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:35.060
We got to get out of the theater, Heather, what you did it again.

01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:36.060
It was nice.

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.060
Good to see you guys.

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.060
Do some improv with Jeff real quick.

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.060
Oh, Jeff.

01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.060
Yeah.

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:41.060
What?

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:42.060
What?

01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:43.060
We're at a time story.

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.060
Ready?

01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:45.060
Yes.

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.060
Hi.

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:47.060
How are you?

01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:48.060
Good.

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:49.060
Rob Schrab, everybody.

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:55.820
I'm your consultant, Jeff Davis, your mayor is Dan Harmon, precious of few of the moments

01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:56.820
we all can share.

01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:00.820
We'll see you for a few more before our Armageddon goes gently into that good night.

01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:02.820
We'll see you all drive fast and take chances.

01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:28.820
Did you get any of that?

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:35.820
Let's go.
