{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:03.000\nZero audio.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:24.000\nHello, yes. Welcome to Nermal Theatre at Meltdown Comics.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:30.000\nHarmontown is now in session. I'm your guest comptroller, Camel Nanjiani.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:35.000\nPlease welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:40.000\nAlright, thank you.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:46.000\nIt's good to see things are already under comptrol.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:50.000\nWell, it's funny because you were like, how can you fuck this up?\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:55.000\nI didn't. I mean, this was the first mic I was trying to use. There's nothing attached.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:59.000\nYeah, we've had a couple guest comptrollers and people want to know.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:04.000\nYou can sense that they want to do the job right as opposed to wrong and stuff,\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:07.000\nand I always am tickled by the notion that you could do it wrong,\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:14.000\nbecause this crowd, I mean, forget it, these guys, they're just lovers.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:17.000\nThey don't care. That could have gone on for 20 minutes.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:20.000\nThey would have watched you change batteries in a flashlight.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:24.000\nI think they had jumped off board. 30 seconds in.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:27.000\nNo way. Did you guys jump off board?\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:30.000\nYou shouldn't ask a negative question.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:34.000\nDid you guys fail to jump off board?\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:37.000\nYeah, right!\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:42.000\nThat's a technique telemarketers use,\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:47.000\nis they always ask questions where the answer can only possibly be yes.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:51.000\nThey'll call you up and go, do you love the lady of the house or something?\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:55.000\nDo you enjoy long distance?\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:59.000\nDo you enjoy long distance?\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:05.000\nThey'll say things that the answer in your brain can't be no,\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:09.000\nso they get you saying yes, and they get you saying yes a lot.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:12.000\nOh, that's smart! Do you like ice cream?\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:14.000\nHitler was a bad guy, right?\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:17.000\nYes, yes! How's your home security?\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:19.000\nI'll take it!\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:25.000\nSo, speaking of security, you were in a hot air balloon on Twitter.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:29.000\nIt wasn't just on Twitter, it was on my regular life also.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:33.000\nI was in the physical world on a hot air balloon.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.000\nBut did you really get into a hot air balloon?\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:42.000\nYeah, I got into a hot air balloon and I realized it is exactly what it says it is.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:47.000\nIt's not helium or anything, it's just a hot air balloon.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:52.000\nIt's air and they heat it and if you stop heating it, you die.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:54.000\nYeah, you crash.\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:01.000\nBut if the propane ran out, whatever they're using to make the torch go,\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:08.000\nit wouldn't be like a plane running out of gas, you would just float down to the ground, right?\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:16.000\nYes, but there's no steering wheel on it, so you land in the middle of a highway and then you're dead.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nI wonder what the statistics are on hot air balloons.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nI think 50% of the people die.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:26.000\nIt's always such a peaceful, seeming mode of transportation,\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:30.000\nwhether they get the smile faces or it's a garfield floating over the trees,\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:32.000\nbut I bet they do that to compensate.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:36.000\nI bet it's like base jumping, I bet people lose their heads and shit.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:38.000\nOh yeah, 50% of people die.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:44.000\nI saw the balloon that they were inflating and it had all these little pieces of tape on it.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:48.000\nI was like, what? Use the one that has no holes in it.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nThey're patching up holes.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:52.000\nI want the new hot air balloon for sure.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:57.000\nYou know, you can take a little bit of nail polish though and put it on there.\n\n03:58.000 --> 03:59.000\nWhat does nail polish do?\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:01.000\nIt just stops the run in the balloon.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nSomething I learned from McCalls.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:05.000\nWhat's McCalls?\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:07.000\nIt's a magazine.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:09.000\nDo you guys know McCalls?\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:12.000\nSome people do.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:23.000\nI'm not from here, so a lot of this is going to be you explaining basic pop cultural things.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:25.000\nSo it's Father's Day.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:27.000\nYou know what that is, right?\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nJust from the name I can surmise.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nDo they have Father's Day in Pakistan?\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:35.000\nNot really.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nBut now he gives a shit, you know, now I have to call.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:43.000\nHe didn't know what it was two years ago, but now very upset that I didn't send flowers.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nI sent flowers to my dad, but I don't know that he got them.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:52.000\nI texted the number I had for my dad in my phone and I was thinking about something else\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:57.000\nand I looked at the text that I sent my dad and it said, Happy Birthday.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nThere's so many sadnesses in that sentence.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:07.000\nThe number I had for my dad is maybe the saddest phrase in the English language.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:12.000\nSo then I immediately followed it up with dot dot dot to all fathers.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.000\nDid he respond?\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nNo.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nBut I don't think it was his number.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:26.000\nI don't know.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:28.000\nHow often are you texting that number?\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nI don't text him a lot.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:37.000\nMy mom has my text message, but my mom was getting eye surgery for her cataracts\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:42.000\nand she was communicating with me through Twitter direct messages,\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:47.000\nwhich come to me as text messages because I'm subscribed to the service.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nAnd then after a while I'm like, you have my text?\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:52.000\nI don't know, it's weird.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:54.000\nYour mom's on Twitter?\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:59.000\nShe has an account that's locked with two followers, me and my aunt,\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nthat she uses to just, I think, read tweets.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:07.000\nShe doesn't want to be tweeting nothing or having anybody tweeting at her.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nHow many people does she follow?\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:11.000\nDoes she follow people?\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:13.000\nI think she just follows me and my aunt.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nI think me and my aunt follow her and I think that's it.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nMy mother-in-law has a Twitter account.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:27.000\nIt has one tweet and so her cousin, her name's Elizabeth Long\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nand her Twitter handle is Elizabeth Bitch Long.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:32.000\nShe's 18, it's okay.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:36.000\nElizabeth Bitch Long and the only, so my grandmother,\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nmy mother-in-law was trying to follow her, but she didn't succeed\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:44.000\nand the only tweet she has is Elizabeth Bitch Long.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:46.000\nIt's the only...\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:48.000\nIt's just her trying to type it in.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nShe typed it in wrong.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nElizabeth Bitch Long, not Elizabeth Bitch Long.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nElizabeth Bitch Long and just tweet and she's like,\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nI give up and it's still outside.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:01.000\nIt's just so confusing.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:06.000\nAlready that's happening to me at 41 but just in ways that are very specific\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:10.000\nbut one day just normal public life is going to be that.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:17.000\nLike everything's going to feel profane and arch and inaccessible\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nand exhaustive, right?\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nBecause you can imagine this poor person typing,\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:25.000\nso what do I...\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:30.000\nI have to type the at symbol and then I have to type her name\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:32.000\nand then the word bitch.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.000\nThis is how I'm allowed to love her with my computer.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:39.000\nIt must seem so overwhelming.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nI remember my grandpa before he died.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:48.000\nIt was really impressively like using his new Macintosh\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:52.000\nto balance the Freemason spreadsheet for his local chapter.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nHe's got his little glasses perched on his nose\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:57.000\nand his little mouse is moving it around\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:02.000\nand you can tell these are hands that clutched bloody bayonets\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:07.000\nat Guadalcanal, you know, thrusting and removing from the enemy.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nThe blood gutters spraying arterial mist into the air\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:13.000\nas he shouted to the clouds,\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:15.000\nFreedom!\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nOnly to come back home and just find out,\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nnow they make the cars for us?\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nYeah, with the left click and the right click.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:25.000\nDifferent things.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nThere's two buttons on the mouse now.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:29.000\nI just learned with the one button.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nThat was back when it was like the idea of the mouse was ridiculous.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nRemember that Star Trek movie where Scotty picks up the mouse\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:37.000\nand he talks into it, hello computer.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nAnyways, you never talk about your dad really.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nYou talked about your parents as a set.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nThey have a unified front.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nThey have made a decision and they're sticking with it.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:52.000\nI'll talk about my dad.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.000\nMy dad is sort of like the funny guy in the family.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nHe would always be doing like jokes.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nHe does jokes about that.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:02.000\nWhat's that ethnic group?\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:04.000\nPatan?\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nIs your dad the first with a snappy patan joke?\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nYeah, that's exactly the kind of jokes he would do.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nAnd he would actually do a lot of like fart and shit jokes.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nAnd to this day I don't think they're funny\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nand I think that's my rebellion against him.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:21.000\nCan you tell us just one joke that your dad really likes?\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:27.000\nHe would always say that if you ate bubblegum you would shit like a yo-yo.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:32.000\nAnd I would be like, dad, that is not funny.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nAnd I still think it's not funny because he said it.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:42.000\nThat seems like a good segue into the realm of conspiracy theories.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nBecause you just launched a podcast on the...\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nOh yeah, I'm doing a podcast called The X Files Files\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\non Feral Audio.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nIt's going to be about The X Files.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nIt's for almost nobody.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nWhat do you mean, going to be? You're on your cover?\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nIt is, yeah. Well, episode three comes out. Dan is on it.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:05.000\nIt's a really great episode.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:09.000\nIt's episode four of The X Files, episode three of the podcast.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nI go by X Files, I go by X Files.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:14.000\nVery poorly thought out.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:18.000\nThis is going to be confusing and inaccessible by design.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:20.000\nIt came out of the gate very successful.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:26.000\nI only have one experience with one podcast, which also came out of the gate very successful.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:28.000\nThank you.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.000\nI just...\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:35.000\nDo new podcasts always kind of end up on the front pages and the things because of their algorithm?\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nNot always, but I think what they do, I choose the algorithm.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:41.000\nI don't know if this is interesting.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:46.000\nIf you're just tuning in to the podcast file file.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:50.000\nI was going to say the podcast cast, but that's an actual podcast.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:57.000\nThe weight weights new subscribers more than existing subscribers.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nIf I get a hundred more, that means more.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\nThat sends me up higher up the charts than someone who has thousands of subscribers.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:09.000\nSo in the beginning you end up higher because you're getting new subscribers and new reviews and stuff more.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:12.000\nIt's like a gold rush. It's like a manifest destiny.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nIt's like they're incentivizing settlers.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nIt is exactly that.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nBecause I was like, I'll just do this and I'll do it every now and then. Who cares?\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:22.000\nAnd then they're like, wow, you're really good at this.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:24.000\nWhich is what Scientology says to you.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nExactly.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nOr like when you draw a tippy turtle for the art school thing.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:34.000\nAnd you send in your shittyly drawn turtle and you always get back.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nI think it goes, whoa, stop the press.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:41.000\nMichelangelo, I think you might be good enough to give us $5,000.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:43.000\nCheck to your parents.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.000\nThat's a good looking turtle.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:47.000\nThat is exactly what this was.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nIt was number one in comedy for like 10 days.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nAnd then you're like, wait, why is it 11 now?\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:55.000\nYeah, what happened?\n\n11:56.000 --> 12:00.000\nI'll tell you, I was very happy for the few days it was above Marin's podcast.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:04.000\nI flirted with taking a screenshot and sending it to him.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nBut I knew I would regret it for the rest of my days.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:09.000\nHe's got to be so sick of that.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nHe's like a yield sign in some hillbilly highway.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nHe's just filled with buckshot.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:20.000\nEveryone that drives by, everyone that has a new podcast is going to like take that screenshot of it.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nI beat Marin.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nWell, it's not really true.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\nWell, not everybody who gets a new podcast gets to beat Marin.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.000\nJust very, you know, rare, X-Files based podcasts get to do that.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:35.000\nAlright, so your dad, he's a, I picture him in a wife beater.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:37.000\nNo.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nHow is it chain smoking?\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:44.000\nWe used to smoke, quit, start it up again, quit.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nIt's a struggle.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:48.000\nI picture him as Tony Shalube.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:50.000\nWho am I kidding?\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nYou picture him as Tony Shalube.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:54.000\nQuick change and that's racist.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:56.000\nNo, monk, monk baby.\n\n12:56.000 --> 13:00.000\nI think your dad is a super intelligent mentally ill detective.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nHe is very intelligent.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nHe's a psychiatrist.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:06.000\nHe's a psychiatrist.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nHe is sort of Shalube in the face.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:10.000\nHe's a little Shalube.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:12.000\nWhat nationality Shalube?\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:14.000\nIs he Lebanese?\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:16.000\nWhy don't you know?\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:18.000\nTony?\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.000\nHis first name is Tony.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:22.000\nI think he's Italian.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:24.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:25.000\nArmenian maybe?\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:27.000\nI don't think he's Armenian.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:29.000\nHe's not Armenian?\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:31.000\nNo, Shalube is like, someone's on it.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nHe's Lebanese.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:40.000\nThere's a couple of years ago in Michigan, he came to Flint to receive from our community college,\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:42.000\nLebanese American of the Year.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:44.000\nHe won Lebanese American of the Year.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nWho is winning it the other years?\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nYou would think Shalube would have a lock on that.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nYeah.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:53.000\nWho is winning?\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:57.000\nHe's the Hulk Hogan of Lebanese Americans for sure.\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nHe certainly is.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:05.000\nThis guy, the friend said, is Shalube from Michigan?\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nI don't think so, but Michigan has a high population of...\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:13.000\nHe came to Flint and won Lebanese American of the Year.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:17.000\nThat's just like Flint's economy is so downtrodden that they're like,\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:21.000\nmaybe we could be the Lebanese capital of the world.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nYeah.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:25.000\nHey, I have a client to get Tony Shalube in here.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:29.000\nThey should just rename it the Tony Shalube Award.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:31.000\nTony Shalube every year.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nThat's like, the mayor of Flint is in this meeting and he's like,\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:39.000\nhe's just looking at all these charts and hearing all these terrible things.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:46.000\nAnd then at this point, actually Newsweek has now classified Flint, Michigan as a third world city.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nAnd the mayor goes, wait a minute.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nWhat if we embraced that?\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:59.000\nWhat if we were the premier third world destination in America?\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nWhat could make third world world?\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nYou come here, you buy a ticket.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nTony Shalube is there, you shake his hand.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:08.000\nYeah.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:10.000\nAre you hungry? There's no food.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:12.000\nThat'll be eight dollars, please.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nThe water is brown and AIDS is everywhere.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nBut probably really fast Wi-Fi.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.000\nSomebody said something about Wi-Fi.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:27.000\nI was like, that's my dish on American Wi-Fi speeds.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nPeople are off board.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nAre you guys getting back off board?\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nI'm off board.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:38.000\nAll right.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\nWhat did you guys do to celebrate?\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nLike, he came.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nI'm going to repeat some people back in here.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nHe did a talk.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nHe talked about being on Monk and Wings.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nAnd then there was a luncheon, of course.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nI mean, you don't have to walk me through everything.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nThis is the Lebanese of the year awards.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:04.000\nI know how this goes.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:06.000\nOf course, there's a luncheon, there's hummus.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:08.000\nLet me guess.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:10.000\nAll the people were really there before.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:12.000\nI didn't see him get a trophy or anything.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:14.000\nYou were there?\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:16.000\nYou were there.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nEverybody in Flint went.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:22.000\nOr was it like a hot ticket item on Craigslist?\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:24.000\nDid you have to go find it?\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nI got to go because I was a student at the Community College.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.000\nYou were a student at the Community College?\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nI had a CC, that's what got me there.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:33.000\nWait, so he came to the Community College?\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nCommunity College.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:37.000\nWow.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:39.000\nI want to get Tony Shalu about this show.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nI mean, he's a good actor.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:44.000\nOh, he's been great forever.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nWe talked about this.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:48.000\nWe talked about Shalu.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nI told you about his performance in Quick Change\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:52.000\nbecause we were talking about you having to go in for roles\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nwhere people are like, oh, this guy's kind of like the guy on...\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.000\nSimpsons.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:00.000\nYeah, Simpsons.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:02.000\nIt's always Simpsons.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nThey want me to do the voice that a white guy did,\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\npretending to be what I actually am,\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:12.000\nwhich is Pakistani, but you know, we're the same.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:14.000\nI remember when Ben...\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:18.000\nlike some time in the vicinity of 9-11\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nwhen everyone was still really amped up,\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nBen Affleck being on The Daily Show,\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:24.000\nand it was...\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:27.000\nyou would think that Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nwould make easy comedic targets for Ben Affleck,\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:32.000\nbut he's on The Daily Show and he kind of like...\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nI remember he was like...\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:36.000\nhe was making some observation about like...\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:38.000\nI think it was something like,\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:40.000\nlike, oh, they closed Disneyland.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:42.000\nThey're worried about Disneyland.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nLike these guys are, you know,\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:48.000\nlike they're going to go, oh, what should we bomb now?\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nAnd he did this voice.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nHe launched into this like a poo voice.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nThat kind of went mildly, as Jeff Davis would say.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:56.000\nI just thought it was really funny.\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:58.000\nHe's like, we just got attacked on this guy,\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:00.000\ncan't land an Al-Qaeda joke.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nThey're like, yeah, they flew planes into us,\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nbut that's a bit much.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:11.000\nAlright, anyways.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nSo my dad is a very, very smart guy.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:16.000\nHe's got a tattoo.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nHe doesn't have any tattoos that I know of.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:21.000\nHe's bald.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nHe has no hair on his head.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nAnd then he started shaving.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:27.000\nHe looks cool.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:29.000\nHe's a psychiatrist.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:31.000\nI've said that.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nI'm realizing I don't know him very well.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nAll the things I'm saying about him are stuff\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nyou could find on his Facebook page.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:41.000\nAre you scared of him?\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.000\nNot like he's under your bed,\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:49.000\nbut just like, are you scared of making him upset?\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:51.000\nLike if you say something in an interview,\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nare you scared?\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nMy dad's not the scary one.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nMy mom's the enforcer.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nBecause you feel like you'll have emotional hell to pay if she...\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:04.000\nIf I had to guess is that my dad would not be...\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nLike my mom's very, very religious.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nThey're both very religious.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nSometimes I get the sense that if they weren't together,\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.000\nmy dad would not be as religious.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:13.000\nSo I think...\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nSo that is interesting,\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nbut it's unfortunately a conversation we're never going to have.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:20.000\nAll right.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nYou mean here tonight?\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.000\nShould I call him?\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:26.000\nCome on.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nI mean, what's the deal with Muhammad, right?\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:30.000\nJust me and you and a hundred other people\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:32.000\nand then thousands tomorrow when it goes up.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:34.000\nIs that...\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nWell, I think it's both.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\nIt's a stereotype and it's fact\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:42.000\nthat fathers and sons have these weird communications.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nThere's so much like tension\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nthat's unspoken and unexpressed.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nYou mean, is it like a competitive thing?\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:53.000\nI'll say this.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nI would think that you...\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nOkay, you grew up in Pakistan.\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nYou came here.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nYou had to...\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:03.000\nI'm treading carefully here.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nNo, no, no. Go for it.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:08.000\nYou feel yourself as kind of like you've achieved\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.000\nescape velocity from something\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:12.000\nthat has a certain membrane around it.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nYou're speaking about your dad as a psychiatrist.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nHe's an intelligent man.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nYou just kind of summed up there\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nand a very important thing.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:29.000\nLike maybe your dad also would achieve that escape velocity.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:34.000\nLike he is this genetic blueprint of you.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:36.000\nThat's how we all...\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nAnd you haven't talked about it with him.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:41.000\nYeah.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nI don't know.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nThe idea of...\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.000\nEarlier today, I was imagining\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nthis is what my fantasies are,\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nhaving like a real conversation with my parents\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nwhere we share our feelings\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\nand I almost got nauseous.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:58.000\nIt was so outside my reality to be like,\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nwell, how do you really feel about this?\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nLike if my dad ever said to me,\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nI'm proud of you,\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:06.000\nI would like really, really...\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nIt just doesn't feel like part of reality.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:11.000\nLike if I would be like,\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nwhat did you do with my dad, Tony Shalu?\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nBecause...\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:18.000\nIt's so outside of...\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nJust him saying that to me made me feel embarrassed.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nLike my face turned red.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nJust me thinking about that idea.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nBut it's not for him, for yourself.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nFor myself, yeah.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:31.000\nBecause it's something that's so...\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:33.000\nIt's like all of a sudden you're in a bathtub\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nand someone's washing your little hinder quarters.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\nRight.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nLike it's too intimate, it's too emotional.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nBut part of it I know is that it would take\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:43.000\nso much effort for him to say that,\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nthat I would feel guilty for making him make that effort.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:47.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:49.000\nMy dad told me,\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nI think I've told the story before, like there was...\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nIt was back when we were just...\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.000\nThe only thing I had going was Channel 101 pilot\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nfor Acceptable TV and for VH1\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nand all the Channel 101 kids.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:01.000\nI watched that show, that show was great.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:03.000\nBefore you.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:05.000\nBefore we knew each other.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:07.000\nNot before you.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nWell they fired me for a season and the sketches were...\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:11.000\nWait, there were two seasons?\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nNo, no, no, I'm kidding.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:15.000\nWe had a party to celebrate Acceptable TV being on VH1,\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:17.000\nso it was

just meant I would be seeking privacy\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:15.000\nand there would probably be a urinal there.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.000\nI didn't mean I would come.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:19.000\nAlthough, I don't know.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nMaybe I would come.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nI don't know what reaction my body would have\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.000\nif my dad said that to me.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nIt's sort of like what you described in that moment\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nin Plain Strings and Automobiles\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:31.000\nwhere he puts his

vulnerable to each other\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nin ways that we don't know what to do with.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nThe next time he came out,\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:42.000\nthe next time he was

you?\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:35.000\nThey were all on rascals.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nIt's not what you think when you hear it.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:41.000\nIt was very funny at the time.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nI just remember my dad at that rap party\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nbecause one guy came up to me\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:49.000\nand he was like,\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nI totally understand this.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:54.000\nI look back on all of it.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nI'm an asshole,\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:58.000\nI love my show too much\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nand

time,\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:08.000\nit was like, look,\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:10.000\nI took that negative behavior,\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:12.000\nI turned it into something positive\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:14.000\nat the rap party, blah, blah, blah.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:16.000\nOne of the crew members\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.000\nwho loved Chevy in spite of everything\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:20.000\nwas trying to explain to me\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nin front of my dad\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.000\nwho must be a huge Chevy Chase fan.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nMy dad's a baby boomer.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nHe's like, yeah, but Chevy,\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nhe's a personality,\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.000\nhe's an asset and all this stuff.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nMy dad just unexpectedly\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:37.000\nsang to this guy like,\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nlook, if you run a business,\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:41.000\nyou tell me that\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:43.000\nif I

25:51.000\nAnd then you came in a urinal.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:53.000\nAnd then I went and came in a urinal.\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:54.000\nI finally got,\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.000\neither my dad got so zen\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:58.000\nand realized that he had,\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:00.000\nor I got so old that\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:02.000\nwe're the same guy.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nHe's saying what's about to come out of my mouth.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:08.000\nThis is interesting.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:10.000\nEmily and I\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:12.000\nare writing a movie together\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:14.000\nand I just realized right now\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nthe movie ends.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.000\nI have this conversation with my dad\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.000\nand it's the conversation of my dreams\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nthat I'm never going to have in real life\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:24.000\nthat I wrote in this movie.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:26.000\nIt's kind of, I just realized that.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.000\nI was like, oh my God,\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:30.000\nit's like the secret.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:32.000\nOh, fuck you.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:36.000\nI just realized that.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:38.000\nI just wrote that conversation\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:40.000\nso that in some way\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:42.000\nit'll be real in my head\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:44.000\neven if it won't be physically real.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:46.000\nSome part of my memory will confuse it\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:48.000\nand be like, oh yeah, you guys had that talk.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:49.000\nIt always makes me wonder\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:51.000\nif our generation has kids.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nHow's that trickle work?\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:55.000\nIt's like, you got my grandpa's\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:57.000\nwho were at Guadalcanal\n\n26:58.000 --> 26:59.000\nand the other one was at\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:01.000\nsomewhere in the European theater,\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:03.000\nboth of them running around\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:05.000\nstabbing and shooting\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:07.000\nand risking their lives.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:09.000\nBoth of them come back home,\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:11.000\nnever say a word about it,\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:13.000\nlet alone write, publish a blog about it\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:15.000\nor a recipe book.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nYou have that silent generation,\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.000\nthe greatest generation\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:21.000\nand then the baby boomer generation.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nThey're like,\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:25.000\nI don't know,\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:27.000\nthey weren't exactly quiet\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nbut they had a little more class\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:32.000\nthan my generation\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:34.000\nin terms of talking about their feelings\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:36.000\nand stuff.\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:38.000\nThen I wonder,\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:40.000\nis this just a slow continuum?\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:42.000\nPretty soon you're just going to have a baby\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nand the baby's crying and you're just crying with it.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:46.000\nAnd then you just both cry\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:48.000\nand you both suck your thumb\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:50.000\nand just roll around.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:52.000\nThat's how I'm going to do it probably.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:54.000\nI would say, because Aaron made that tavern\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:56.000\nin my house upstairs.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:58.000\nMcHarmon's.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nI thought, this is a great nursery\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:02.000\nbecause you could put a crib\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nin the middle of it and maybe really realize\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:06.000\nyou could just have bottles of vodka\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:08.000\nand bottles of milk along the wall\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nand I could just sit in there\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nand we could both just shit our pants\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:14.000\nand cry\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:16.000\nand talk about how we hate being told\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:18.000\nwhen to go to bed.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:21.000\nI mean, we talked about this\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:23.000\nwhen we were talking about\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:25.000\nif I'm going to have kids or not,\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:27.000\nI was like, I don't feel like a grown-up.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:29.000\nI feel like I'm still shitting my pants.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:31.000\nMy dad was always a grown-up to me\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:33.000\nand it felt like he had the authority\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:35.000\nto raise a child.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nI don't have the authority to raise a child.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nWhat I want to talk to this little,\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nlike, what's the world like?\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nI don't know.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:45.000\nI've been saving Hyrule my whole life.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:47.000\nI've saved it like 20 times over.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:49.000\nThat's all I know.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:51.000\nI don't know anything.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:53.000\nIs everyone just faking it?\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.000\nOr do people know?\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:57.000\nI think some people don't have to fake it\n\n28:58.000 --> 28:59.000\nin some areas.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:01.000\nSome people are just really good at\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:03.000\nputting a car up on blocks\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:05.000\nand changing the oil and the tires\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nbecause they get to enjoy it that much\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:08.000\nbecause they're not as good\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\nat writing a sonnet.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:12.000\nI don't know.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:14.000\nIt all comes out in the wash.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:16.000\nI'm not saying that a guy that can fix a car\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:18.000\ncan't write a poem.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:20.000\nI'm not saying that at all.\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:22.000\nI'm not saying he's dumb just because he's handy.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:24.000\nI just mean that we all have a bingo card.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:26.000\nYou just have random shit.\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:28.000\nThere's a guy out there that's like,\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:30.000\nI'm good at fixing the car and writing the sonnets,\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:32.000\nbut they've got to be bad at gardening\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nand managing their emotions or something.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:36.000\nThere's something that you do and I do\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nthat's like quote-unquote manlier\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:41.000\nthan average.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nJust one random category.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:46.000\nYou wouldn't be able to recognize it\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:48.000\nfrom across a room.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:50.000\nThere's some specific,\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:52.000\nmaybe it's just the amount of bullying\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:54.000\nyou'll put up with.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:56.000\nThat doesn't feel very manly.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nI know, but take it to an extreme.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nMartin Luther King,\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nat a certain point you become a real man\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:06.000\nafter putting up with a lot of shit.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nYou can change the world by putting up with it.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:13.000\nAnyways,\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:15.000\nwatch this segue.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nCheck it out.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:19.000\nI'm

grown-up.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nI was feeling like that\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:30.000\nwhen we watched the X-Files\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:33.000\nbecause I was on your X-Files thing.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nI see where you're going.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:37.000\nI was watching David Duchovny\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nand it's like,\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:41.000\nFox Mulder was 29 years old\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:43.000\nin season one of X-Files\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:45.000\nand I thought, he's a grown-up.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:47.000\nI'm 41 and he's just still a grown-up to me.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:49.000\nSpeaking of X-Files\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:51.000\nand X-Files podcasts\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:53.000\nand conspiracy theories,\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nthere's a new podcast in town.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:57.000\nCamille.\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nWell done, dad.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:01.000\nThat is also about those things\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:03.000\nbut it's not based on the fictional.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:05.000\nIt's based on the fiction\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:07.000\nthat people\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:09.000\neither believe in or don't\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:11.000\nthat happens in real life.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:13.000\nIt's called Real Life Sci-Fi.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:15.000\nDid I get that title right?\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:17.000\nYeah.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:19.000\nAnd it's by our very old Channel 101 friends,\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:21.000\nour comrades.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:22.000\nWe're going to come out here\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:24.000\nto talk about their new podcast.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nWillie Roberts and Wade Randolph.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:32.000\nI could have done that better.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:35.000\nNo, that was fucking perfect.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:37.000\nKind of weak, I think.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:39.000\nI don't know why.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:41.000\nWell, see, there you go.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:43.000\nYou guys have a Scully-Mulder\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:45.000\nrelationship on the show, right?\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:47.000\nWade's the skeptic.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:49.000\nI never seen X-Files.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:50.000\nThat sucks.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:52.000\nI'm the Smulder.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:54.000\nThe Smulder, yes, the Smulder.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:56.000\nYou know the names.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:58.000\nYou don't know Scully and Mulder?\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:00.000\nNo.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:02.000\nAnd you're doing a conspiracy theory podcast?\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nIt's not about your fucking bullshit.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:08.000\nIt's about real stuff.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:10.000\nThey're clapping for me.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:12.000\nI don't think they are.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:14.000\nThey just want to fight.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:16.000\nThey want the loose change to hit the floor.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nSo is it just conspiracy theories?\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nOr is it also...\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:23.000\nWell, it's eventually going to be everything\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nthat you'll run out of real-life sci-fi.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:28.000\nLike, you know...\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nBigfoot, ghosts, UFOs.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nIs the focus always on whether it's real or not?\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:39.000\nWell, yeah, kind of.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:41.000\nWillie's the thing.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:46.000\nIf you talk to anybody who is into conspiracy theories,\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:48.000\nthere's too much information.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nAnd so, like, in order for it to be yes or no,\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:55.000\nit's hard because it's like you could just ramble on\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:57.000\nand a lot of things don't connect.\n\n32:58.000 --> 32:59.000\nSo if I were to say,\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nHollow Earth, which I've always been fascinated by.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nThat's a good one.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:06.000\nLike, Hollow Earth, to me...\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:08.000\nWell, Willie believes everything he reads.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nWillie does. Yeah.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:12.000\nAnd I don't.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:14.000\nI give everything I read a chance.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:16.000\nLike, to me, Hollow Earth thing is an interdimensional thing.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:18.000\nNot like a...\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:20.000\nHow do you mean?\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nLike, if you read about the guy who said he was flying his plane\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:24.000\nand then he was over North Pole\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:26.000\nand then there was a hole opening\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:28.000\nand he went through it.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:30.000\nIt's like Saxon.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:32.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nMaybe he hit an interdimensional portal\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:38.000\nthat was caused by some magnetic field disruption.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nRight.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.000\nIs that the story?\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:44.000\nHe was flying over the North Pole.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:46.000\nAnd then why did he end up?\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.000\nAnd he saw a hole and flew into it?\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:50.000\nYeah, there was one guy who did that.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:52.000\nYou're right.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:54.000\nIf you're a pilot and you see a hole,\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:56.000\ndon't fly into the hole.\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:58.000\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nYou're a terrible pilot.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:02.000\nHow do you turn around?\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:05.000\nIt's like the number one no-no in air travel.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:07.000\nIt's the natural enemy of air travel.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:11.000\nThe ground is cancer in air flight.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\nLike this particular guy's story,\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:15.000\nhe flew into the middle of the earth\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nand then the beings there landed his plane\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:20.000\nand then he met them.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:22.000\nAnd then the beings in Hollow Earth.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:26.000\nBecause I've read that the Hollow Earth,\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:30.000\nit starts with just the idea that\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:33.000\nmuch like the flat earth people,\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nlike it just starts with the question,\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:38.000\nhow do we know the earth's not hollow?\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:40.000\nWhat do you got?\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:42.000\nPictures of a solid earth.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:44.000\nAnd then so some people,\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:46.000\nbranches off into this tree, right?\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:48.000\nWhere it's like some people think,\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:50.000\noh, that's where the Nazis went.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.000\nYeah.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:54.000\nAnd then some people go,\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:56.000\nthat's where the aliens are.\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\nAnd then some people are like,\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nwhich I think is amazing.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:01.000\nIt's fun.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:03.000\nI think it's fun that there are people out there\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:05.000\nwho in the present day are like\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:07.000\nweaving mythology out of the thing\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:09.000\nthat's really happening.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.000\nMy thing is I just like to talk about all that\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:13.000\nbecause normally you bring something up\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:15.000\nand it's like, oh, that was kind of interesting,\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nthis shitty article I found on the internet.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:19.000\nI want to talk to somebody about it\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\nand then you just get laughed at\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:23.000\nand this is like, well,\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:25.000\nI won't talk to anybody about this.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:28.000\nBut you want to have the fun with it.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:30.000\nBut then other people are like,\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:32.000\nwell, that's dangerous because it was fun\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:34.000\nto think that you could burn women\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:36.000\nat the stake in the 1500s.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:40.000\nIt was fun to think leeches were curing people.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nYou need to be skeptical to protect people.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:45.000\nYeah.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:47.000\nWhat kind of topics do you guys talk about?\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:49.000\nJust say the topics and I'll,\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:51.000\nI know for sure if they're real or not.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:53.000\nI actually have the information.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:54.000\nI'll tell you a yes or no.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:56.000\nTell me, say it.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:58.000\nChemtrails?\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:00.000\nI don't know what that is.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:02.000\nTell us what chemtrails are.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:04.000\nChemtrails is like,\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nnow there's a bunch of different reasons for it\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:09.000\nor conspiracy theories about it,\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nbut that there is an additive in jet fuel\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:16.000\nthat is being released over everywhere.\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:18.000\nIt's fake.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:20.000\nMaking us docile.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nYeah, one of them is to make us docile.\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:24.000\nIt's like a mind control thing.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:26.000\nOkay, that's not true.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:28.000\nThat one's lies.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:30.000\nNo, Camille's right.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:32.000\nWhat's the next one?\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:34.000\nOne of those is like,\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:36.000\nwell, they're trying to block out some of the sun\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:40.000\nto protect us from overheating.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:42.000\nWhy would they not tell us\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:44.000\nif that's what they're doing?\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:46.000\nBecause everyone would say no.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:48.000\nEveryone would say no,\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:49.000\nbut that's the key.\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:51.000\nWell, here's the thing.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:53.000\nI know it's not working\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:55.000\nbecause we can see the fucking sun.\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:57.000\nIt's out there every day.\n\n36:58.000 --> 36:59.000\nIf you look at history, though,\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:01.000\nthe government has done tests\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:03.000\non people without their permission\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:05.000\nforever.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:07.000\nOh, yeah, no.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:09.000\nThat's the cool thing about conspiracy theories\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:11.000\nis it's an interesting line\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:13.000\nbetween like there are some people\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:15.000\nwho talk in fantastical terms\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:18.000\nand have a flexible grip on logic\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:20.000\nthat will abuse it.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:22.000\nSo the scientific mind says,\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:24.000\nwell, we have to protect the underlings\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:26.000\nfrom this kind of stuff.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:28.000\nYou have to be skeptical\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:30.000\nand use scientific method.\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:32.000\nBut, however, the healthy thing\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:34.000\nabout paranoia is that you should\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:36.000\nnever trust the government.\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:38.000\nAnd it always turns out every 30 years\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:40.000\nthat they were doing fucked up shit\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:42.000\n30 years ago.\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:43.000\nWell, even though I do hate the word\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:45.000\nthe government because, like,\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:47.000\neven within our government,\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:49.000\nthere's 20s that don't work, right?\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:51.000\nWhat an asshole.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:53.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:55.000\nMe and Adam said it together\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:57.000\nand I immediately knew I was on the wrong side.\n\n37:58.000 --> 37:59.000\nI'm sorry, Willie.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:01.000\nGhosts?\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:03.000\nGhosts? Not real.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:05.000\nFake.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:07.000\nWhat about ghost ads?\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:09.000\nTake it easy, Adam.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:10.000\nOh.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:13.000\nFluorinating the water.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:15.000\nWhat do you guys think of ghosts?\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:17.000\nWhat's your take on it?\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:19.000\nWe haven't covered it yet.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:21.000\nI could be convinced, maybe.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:23.000\nYou could be convinced.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:25.000\nYeah.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:27.000\nDad, what do you think?\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:29.000\nI don't think that dead people\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:31.000\nkeep being people.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:33.000\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:35.000\nYeah.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:37.000\nAnd I feel like light bounces off\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:38.000\nsolid things.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:40.000\nBut if Jeff Davis was here,\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:42.000\nhe could tell you, like, four ghost stories.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:44.000\nYeah, yeah, he has a lot of ghost stories.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:46.000\nAnd then they're great.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:48.000\nBut I do believe,\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:50.000\nor I should say I am willing to believe,\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:52.000\ndefinitely, because to me skepticism\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:54.000\nloses its value at the point\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:56.000\nwhere it starts to become dogmatic.\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:58.000\nWhere you start to assume that the things\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:00.000\nyou don't know, you know everything about.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:02.000\nSo I do believe that it's perfectly\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:05.000\npossible that there is, like,\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:06.000\nthat we're, because we're evolved from apes\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:09.000\nthat are only biological purposes\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:12.000\nto recognize a good banana from a bad one.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:15.000\nAnd we've graduated into this world\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:17.000\nwhere we're starting to understand things.\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:20.000\nIt's totally possible that there's a lot more\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:23.000\nways to perceive things than we actually...\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:25.000\nYou kind of bring up a good point, though,\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:27.000\nbecause there's no ape ghosts.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:29.000\nNobody ever...\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:31.000\nNobody ever has.\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:33.000\nThere was an X-Files about animal ghosts, wasn't there?\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:34.000\nFuck, yes.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:36.000\nAnd I watched this show. Great episode.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:38.000\nLike, you don't find, like,\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:40.000\nyou think that there'd be, like,\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:42.000\nNative American ghosts in the free country,\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:44.000\nor in the open land.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:46.000\nBut they never, Native Americans,\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:48.000\nI don't want to be racist,\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:50.000\nbut they never die with unfinished business.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:52.000\nThey use the whole life.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:54.000\nI can explain that.\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:57.000\nThey're famous for it.\n\n39:58.000 --> 39:59.000\nIt's not racism if it's a good stereotype.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:01.000\nNo, it's good.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:02.000\nIt's totally good.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nI just riffed that, isn't it awesome?\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:07.000\nNo, I'm a really good racist.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:09.000\nYou're, like, a genius.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:11.000\nIt was really good.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:13.000\nIt felt like you'd written that at home.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:15.000\nIt was a real good racist.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:17.000\nIt was really good.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:19.000\nIt was a good quick defense.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:21.000\nSo...\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:23.000\nYeah, go ahead.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:25.000\nNo, I just connect dots with racist stereotypes.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:27.000\nNo, I could take credit for it all night.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:29.000\nLet's go on.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:30.000\nFor you, Dan,\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:32.000\nfor you to be open to the idea of ghosts,\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:34.000\ndoesn't that...\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:36.000\ndon't you have to change pretty fundamental things\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:38.000\nabout how you see the world?\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:40.000\nWell, no, because I don't automatically assume\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:42.000\nthat when we talk about ghosts,\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:44.000\nwhat I think of when I think about ghosts\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:46.000\nis I think about when you're in your apartment\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:48.000\nbrushing your teeth and you turn and you go,\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:50.000\nwell, fuck!\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:52.000\nThere's a fucking dude with a ten-speed bike\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:54.000\nover his shoulder,\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:56.000\nwalking through my living room.\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nThat could be explained by a lot of things\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:00.000\nthat don't have to do with there being a heaven\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nor people dying and their skin falling away\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:05.000\nand then I'm just like, I love ten-speeds\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:07.000\nand I'm going to go spread the word\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:09.000\nbecause I got to solve my murder.\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:11.000\nIt doesn't...\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:14.000\nIt could be like a psychic smudge.\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:16.000\nIt could be that that person...\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:18.000\nLike residual energy or something?\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:20.000\nThat person fell in love with a woman\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:25.000\nand every morning when he hoisted his ten-speed\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\nover his shoulder to go to work in that apartment,\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:32.000\nhis heart became filled with this emotional energy\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:36.000\nthat over time the way a key on your keyboard\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:38.000\ncan become melted.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:40.000\nIf you work in a data entry lab,\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nlike the home row is melted from friction\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:45.000\nof hitting the same button over the same amount of time.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nAnd it's just brought out by you brushing your teeth?\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:51.000\nLike no, it's just another...\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:53.000\nIt's human perception.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:55.000\nI don't know.\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:57.000\nThis is assuming that there's some fields\n\n41:58.000 --> 41:59.000\nthat we haven't discovered yet\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:01.000\nthat we can perceive.\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:03.000\nOne of them is light bouncing into our retina\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nand then maybe some of it is like somehow\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:08.000\nthis would get into psychic energy\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nthat this guy had this experience.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:13.000\nHe would eat a nut bar\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:15.000\nand he'd throw his bike over his shoulder\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nand it was like somehow for him it was like a big deal.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:20.000\nIt was like he did it over and over again\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nor he did it one day and it was like he achieved\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:26.000\nself-actualization at that moment\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:29.000\nor he was really angry or whatever.\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:33.000\nBut there's like some weird fingerprint on the film\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:35.000\nand then you turn and you're brushing your teeth\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nand you see that guy's feelings.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:40.000\nYou see his self-image.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:42.000\nHe left it there in your apartment.\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:45.000\nYeah, some kind of like residual energy echo\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:47.000\nthat we'll just never know about or...\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:49.000\nI don't know.\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:51.000\nI'm open to most things.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:53.000\nBut I don't think I would ever wake up\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:55.000\nwhen there would be a guy sitting on my bed\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\ngoing like hey, I'm Napoleon.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:02.000\nI buried my hat at McDonald's.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:04.000\nThen he goes...\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:06.000\nI have unfinished business.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:08.000\nWait, do we have to take over Russia now?\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:10.000\nAll these cabinets should be open.\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:11.000\nAll these cabinets should be open.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:13.000\nI just got to find my hat.\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:15.000\nIt's under the McDonald's. Go find it.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:17.000\nYou could make a lot of money on that hat.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:19.000\nYou know, when you get into...\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:21.000\nI just started...\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:23.000\nTime, okay.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:25.000\nTime, fellas.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:27.000\nIt's symmetrical.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:29.000\nWe're experiencing it one moment after another\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:31.000\nbut there's all this...\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:33.000\nI need a couple more degrees\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:35.000\nand a few more IQ points before\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:37.000\nI could really understand this or explain it\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nbut smart people will tell you\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:43.000\nthat time unfolds in all directions.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:45.000\nIs that what you're hearing?\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:47.000\nAnything you can describe that happens in time.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nFirst of all, time is a variable and blah, blah, blah.\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:52.000\nWhen your cabinet doors are open,\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:54.000\nthey've all come open overnight,\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nmaybe some lady that lived in your apartment\n\n43:58.000 --> 43:59.000\nopened them in 1938.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:05.000\nAnd somehow time got shuffled.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:09.000\nBut yeah, I just don't believe in hopeful ghosts\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nlike talking to you and going like,\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:14.000\nhey, I'm dead.\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:16.000\nAnd they're like, you're dead. Get out of here.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:18.000\nAnd he's like, I'm sorry, I'm so dead.\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nFor some reason I draw the line at just dialogue.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nIt just starts to get corny.\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nNo, that's a huge leap from just a smudge on the film\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:29.000\nto unfinished business.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:31.000\nThat's a big leap.\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:33.000\nI get it. I agree.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nTo me, unfinished business is so, it can be so,\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:37.000\nlike the unfinished business you have right now\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:39.000\nand you're all alive is like,\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:41.000\ncan be so beautiful and stupid.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:43.000\nSounds like a romantic comedy that we're writing.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:45.000\nUnfinished business.\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nI just remembered something really funny.\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nI did this media conference in beautiful,\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:53.000\nin the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Canada\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:55.000\nwhere there was, it was taking this hotel\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:57.000\nthat was absolutely shining,\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nlike all the good parts of the shining,\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nlike all the beautiful parts, none of the dead\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:04.000\nScatman crothers or anything.\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nAnd I kept saying, oh yeah, this place is,\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:09.000\nthis place is definitely haunted.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:11.000\nIf any place is haunted, is that,\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:13.000\nis that the air coming out of the show?\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:15.000\nI think it's a smudge on the film.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:17.000\nThere was a woman who used to dry her hair here\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:19.000\n30 years ago.\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nAnd I was out on a patio at a party with Erin\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:25.000\nand it was like, oh yeah, that place is probably haunted\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:27.000\nand this guy was like, oh yeah,\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nhave you seen Toby?\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:31.000\nOr like some guy's name.\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:33.000\nOr like, who's Toby?\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:35.000\nHe's like, oh, the Bellman, yeah.\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:37.000\nYeah, he definitely, people see him there\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:39.000\nat the hotel.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nLike, oh yeah, what does he do?\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:44.000\nHe's like, oh, you know, he's the Bellman.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:46.000\nHe just, he'll take your luggage.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nAnd I was like, I don't know, so funny.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:51.000\nDo you have a Canadian ghost?\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:53.000\nHave you ever lost a back?\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:55.000\nBecause that's Toby.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nCanadian ghost, his unfinished business is just his job.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:00.000\nIt's just people.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:02.000\nHe's never experienced love.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:04.000\nGeez, you know what, I forgot to thank Mr. Henderson\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:06.000\nin 314.\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:08.000\nI should really tell him a good job.\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:10.000\nVery sad.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:12.000\nThat's very sad.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:14.000\nI love the idea of a ghost.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:16.000\nHe's just like, oh God, I still have to do\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:18.000\nthe terrible job I had.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:21.000\nWe were falling over ourselves because\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:23.000\nI'm sure the guy walked away like, he's\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\na ghost, but like, I was like, does he say boo?\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:27.000\nHow does he pronounce?\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:29.000\nMy big question is, how does a Canadian ghost\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:31.000\npronounce boo?\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:33.000\nAll right.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:35.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:37.000\nThere were a couple of false starts on that joke\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:39.000\nor I'm going to really kill him.\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:41.000\nAll right, so boo.\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:43.000\nYou don't belong here.\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:45.000\nThat's good, that's something.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:48.000\nBut I was in the first episode of your podcast\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:50.000\nand we talked about UFOs.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nYeah, whether they're real or not.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nWe were focusing more on the moon landing being faked.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:57.000\nOh yeah, the moon landing being faked, right.\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:01.000\nBecause the moon, according to you, is a metal base.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:04.000\nA metal base?\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nWell, when things hit it, it sounds like a bell\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:11.000\nand none of the craters are deeper than the others\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:13.000\nor something.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:15.000\nWhen things hit it, it sounds like a bell?\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nThey blew up, they put a bomb on the moon\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:19.000\nand they said it.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:21.000\nSome people claim that it rang like a bell.\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\nWhen did they put a bomb on the moon?\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:26.000\nI didn't get to vote for this.\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nThere's so much to buy into this story.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:31.000\nSo many barriers.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:33.000\nI don't care what you believe about the moon,\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:35.000\nit's weird that we bomb the moon\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:37.000\nand most people don't know about it.\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:39.000\nWhat?\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:41.000\nWhen did we...\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:43.000\nWe were looking for water.\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:45.000\nYeah, but we didn't tell anybody we were looking\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nfor water just in this bomb up to the moon.\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:49.000\nWas it a nuke?\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:51.000\nNo, no, it was just a bomb.\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:53.000\nJust like a regular bomb.\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nIt was just like a bundle of TNT with an alarm clock on it.\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:58.000\nWith a NASA logo.\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nThere's that whole thing about us being warring off the moon.\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:04.000\nConspiracy theorists love that,\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nthe idea that we haven't actually done a moon mission\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:09.000\nsince forever.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:12.000\nAnd the idea is that we got there\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\nand then an alien said, get out of here.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:16.000\nYou get out of my moon.\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:19.000\nYou damn kids.\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:21.000\nYou got the big one right there.\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nYeah, yours is bigger than ours.\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:26.000\nLet me have this one.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:28.000\nThere are just like eight of us here\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:30.000\nand we got the moon, you guys got the big one.\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:32.000\nBut what are the conspiracy theories about the moon?\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:34.000\nYou said that the other side of the moon,\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:36.000\nthe dark side of the moon has like a base on it.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:38.000\nWell, I mean, here's the thing.\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:40.000\nOh, that's right.\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:41.000\nThat's right.\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:43.000\nBut like, okay.\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:45.000\nI'll give them this real quick.\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:47.000\nI've been looking for UFOs my whole life\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:49.000\nand I've never seen them.\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:51.000\nAnd then one year I saw like 30 all at once.\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:56.000\nAnd I called someone from across town.\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:58.000\nLike a fleet of them?\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:00.000\nYeah.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:02.000\nI like that there's more to this story\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:04.000\nthat has nothing to do with you having seen 30 UFOs.\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:07.000\nHow did you see 30 UFOs?\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nExplain that part.\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nI mean, you know, I like to look at the sky.\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:14.000\nI'm fascinated by planes.\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\nThey're just silver things in the sky.\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:19.000\nYeah, I mean, I'm not saying they're aliens.\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nYou're just saying that I'm an identified plane object.\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:24.000\n30 of them.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:26.000\nAnd they look like stars in the middle of the day.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:28.000\nIt's like they're hard to focus on.\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:30.000\nYou look at the blue sky and you got like eye boogers\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:32.000\nand weird like eye snakes and you can't focus.\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:34.000\nYou don't know what your focal length is.\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nAnd then so like I'll see one.\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:38.000\nI'll look away and I'll be hard to find,\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:40.000\nbut I'll always be with people.\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:42.000\nI'm like, hey, look at that.\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:44.000\nWhat do you think it is?\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:46.000\nAnd we'll look at it for like a half hour\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:48.000\nand it doesn't do anything that I recognize, you know.\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:50.000\nAnd I saw 30 one day.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:52.000\nAnd this is the first time I saw it.\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:54.000\nI thought an alien invasion was happening.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:56.000\nI took pictures.\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:58.000\nI took video.\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:00.000\nI was drawing like some of them were moving\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:02.000\nand some of them weren't.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:03.000\nI watched the skies for the rest of the day.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:05.000\nThey had changed the flight patterns\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:07.000\nfor Burbank and LAX.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:09.000\nBut that's just bullshit.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:11.000\nYou don't know that you should look up.\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:13.000\nOnline the flight patterns.\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:15.000\nNo, no, I look at the flight patterns all the time.\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:17.000\nLike when the wind changes.\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:19.000\nYou just watch the skies and you go, oh, there's no planes.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:21.000\nBut you can see where they were they redirected to.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:23.000\nWait, wait, there was one day of your life\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:25.000\nwhere you said that an alien invasion was imminent.\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:27.000\nYeah.\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:29.000\nWe already know each other then?\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:31.000\nJust fucking text me.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:33.000\nWell, here's the thing.\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:35.000\nIf you think an alien invasion,\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:37.000\nI want to be on the list of people\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:39.000\nand like, hey, shit's going down.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:41.000\nCome on, get on the ground.\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:43.000\nI was sitting there going like,\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:45.000\nis this hot?\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:47.000\nJust fucking text me, dude.\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:49.000\nI'll be the one to judge.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:51.000\nYou're going to get a text every other day.\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:53.000\nYou're going to get a lot of text.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:55.000\nEspecially 30 a day.\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:57.000\nOkay, here's the thing.\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nI drew out a map of the ones that were stationary\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:01.000\nand the ones that were moving.\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:03.000\nTo me, it was like, oh, this looks like a constellation.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:05.000\nCould other people see him too?\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:07.000\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:09.000\nI've been with at least 30 people.\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:11.000\nI've been like, what's that?\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:13.000\nIt's 30, just the number.\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:15.000\nIt's only 30.\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:17.000\nIs that the highest you can count?\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:19.000\nI could say 10 names right now off the top of my head.\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:21.000\nYou were with?\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:23.000\nYeah.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:25.000\nObama, Margaret Thatcher.\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:26.000\nI've been with groups of people.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:28.000\nAnd people have seen these things.\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:30.000\nI mean, I've seen them.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:32.000\nBut not in Armada.\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:34.000\nI've seen one or two.\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:36.000\nAnd they're just silver things.\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:38.000\nBut here's my things.\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:40.000\nOkay, I saw these things and then I started telling people\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:42.000\nbecause to me it was like, this is kind of fucking weird.\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:44.000\nI should tell everyone I know.\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:46.000\nDidn't tell me.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:48.000\nI guess I'm not one of the people.\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:50.000\nI even told Wade at the first party I went to.\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:52.000\nI don't know if you remember,\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nI kind of laughed it off and like nobody was listening to me.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nAnd I was like, this is weird because I saw something that to me,\n\n51:58.000 --> 51:59.000\nI'm not saying they're aliens.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:01.000\nI'm just saying this was life changing to me\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:03.000\nbecause there were things in the sky that I didn't know what they were.\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nAnd it made me think and everyone was basically laughing\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:08.000\nor not believing it.\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:10.000\nAnd made me go like, everybody that has a weird story\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:12.000\nthat people laugh at like,\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:14.000\nI want to listen to their story a little more.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:16.000\nEvery movie, every sci-fi movie,\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:19.000\nyour character is the good guy.\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nBut in life, you're the crazy guy.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:25.000\nYour only record is the right sci-fi movies.\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:29.000\nDo you guys have people on the show that are like experts,\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:31.000\nlike ufologists?\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:33.000\nNot yet. I want to get there though.\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:35.000\nThey had me on.\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:37.000\nLike you believe in the UFOs?\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:39.000\nI was like, it's possible.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:41.000\nAnd he's seen all the X files.\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:43.000\nWell, I would talk to you guys all night,\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:47.000\nbut my sluggishness means we got a train scheduled to keep.\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:50.000\nIt's real life sci-fi. It's on Farrell Audio.\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:52.000\nI think it launches Monday.\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:54.000\nIt's going to be on Farrell Audio on Monday.\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nWhich is today, I guess, for all of us on purpose.\n\n52:58.000 --> 52:59.000\nYeah, it'll be today when most people hear about it.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:01.000\nThis is a crazy audience, by the way,\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\nbecause they're willing to not watch the Game of Thrones finale.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nMost of them are watching on the East Coast feed.\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:09.000\nOh, you've already seen it?\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:11.000\nOkay, don't tell me.\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:13.000\nHow was that?\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:15.000\nThey do.\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:16.000\nThey're very...\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:19.000\nWe have a relationship here.\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:21.000\nThese guys are good people.\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\nI understand the NBA finals.\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:26.000\nYou guys can miss that.\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:28.000\nBut Game of Thrones, shit.\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nAll right, well, thank you Wade Randolph,\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:33.000\nWillie Roberts, for coming by.\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:35.000\nThanks for having us on.\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:37.000\nReal life sci-fi.\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:40.000\nHey, just put it down.\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nAll right, so we've got to keep the train speeding,\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:44.000\nspeeding along.\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:46.000\nI've fucked up real bad.\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:48.000\nI've made our show real long.\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:50.000\nIs it going too long?\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:52.000\nNo, I just mean, there's so much to do.\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:54.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, there's so much to do.\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:56.000\nThere's one other thing to do.\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:58.000\nLet's go on to the next segment.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:00.000\nErin McGathy, will you come out, please?\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:03.000\nThis is my fiancée.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:05.000\nHi, everybody.\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:07.000\nHi.\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:08.000\nSo I'm here for a special reason.\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:10.000\nYes.\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nThe Harmontown documentary is premiering\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:15.000\ntomorrow night.\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:17.000\nAnd we actually have two tickets\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:19.000\nto the Harmontown documentary.\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:21.000\nAnd Dan was like,\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:23.000\nhow should we give these away?\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:25.000\nAnd I begged to do a McGathey game corner.\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:27.000\nYeah!\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:29.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:31.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

no, he said yes.\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:40.000\nSo is there, is there anybody here\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:42.000\nwho does not have tickets tomorrow\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:44.000\nand really wants to go?\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:46.000\nAll right, we got two hands here.\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:48.000\nCome on up, sir.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:50.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:52.000\nDaniel.\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:54.000\nGreat.\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:56.000\nAnd then hands again.\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:58.000\nWe should do a lady one.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:00.000\nWe should do a

right.\n\n01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.200\nBethany, vogue or drink the Kool-Aid?\n\n01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.200\nThese are your categories.\n\n01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.200\nVogue or drink the Kool-Aid?\n\n01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.200\nVogue.\n\n01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.200\nAll right.\n\n01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.200\nThese are famous supermodels.\n\n01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.200\nSo Dan is going to do an impression of a supermodel.\n\n01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.200\nA specific one.\n\n01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.200\nI don't know what this sounds like either.\n\n01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:01.200\nOne of the things which distinguishes ours from all earlier generations is this.\n\n01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.200\nThat we have seen our atoms.\n\n01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.200\nI've never heard this person talk.\n\n01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.200\nThat's right.\n\n01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.200\nSome of the categories.\n\n01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.200\nCan I see that?\n\n01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.200\nYeah.\n\n01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:18.200\nSo is that A, Cindy Crawford, B, Brooke Shields, or C, Amon?\n\n01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.200\nLet's go with C.\n\n01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.200\nC.\n\n01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.200\nA.\n\n01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200\nThat is correct.\n\n01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.200\nShe can hear my mole.\n\n01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.200\nA lot of people in the audience are yelling out C, so maybe you do a good Amon.\n\n01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.200\nDo you guys never see House of Style?\n\n01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.200\nShe talked...\n\n01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.200\nDo you guys know House of Style?\n\n01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.200\nShe talked on that all the time.\n\n01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.200\nI never watched House of Style.\n\n01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.200\nCamille, what's the score?\n\n01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.200\nBethany 2, Dan 0.\n\n01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.200\nBut Bethany did go...\n\n01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.200\nI mean, Dan 1.\n\n01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.200\nBut Bethany did go first, so...\n\n01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.200\nRight, exactly.\n\n01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.200\nAll right.\n\n01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.200\nDan, drink the Kool-Aid or free entertainment?\n\n01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.200\nFree entertainment.\n\n01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200\nAll right.\n\n01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:14.200\nHere, this is a podcast host.\n\n01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:19.200\nOne of the things which distinguishes ours from all earlier generations is this, that\n\n01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.200\nwe have seen our atoms.\n\n01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:29.200\nIs that A, Paul F. Tompkins, B, Marc Maron, C, Ira Glass.\n\n01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.200\nCan I see the list?\n\n01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.200\nI wanted to say A.\n\n01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200\nI'll go with A.\n\n01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.200\nThat is correct!\n\n01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:43.200\nAlthough I would love to see Dan's Ira Glass.\n\n01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.200\nDo it.\n\n01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:50.200\nWe're back with Public Radio.\n\n01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:57.200\nOne of the things I found most interesting, since you left us, is the story about Jacob.\n\n01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.200\nNot Jacob.\n\n01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.200\nWho lost his leg.\n\n01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.200\nYeah.\n\n01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:07.200\nJacob lost his leg in a cup of water.\n\n01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.200\nWhat does that do to a person?\n\n01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.200\nHow many legs do you need?\n\n01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:17.200\nWe'll be right back.\n\n01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.200\nSo that was Dan.\n\n01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.200\nYou guessed that right.\n\n01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.200\nThat was Dan.\n\n01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.200\nSo it's tied, 2-2.\n\n01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.200\nAll right.\n\n01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:29.200\nBethany, drink the Kool-Aid or wicked packing?\n\n01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:32.200\nI'll go wicked packing.\n\n01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.200\nAll right.\n\n01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:41.200\nThis is an actor from Boston.\n\n01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:45.200\nThere is only one proof method of assisting the advancement of pure science.\n\n01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:54.200\nThat of picking men of genius, backing them heavily, and leaving them to direct themselves.\n\n01:07:54.200 --> 01:08:06.200\nAll right, was that A, Ben Affleck, B, Donald Loog, C, Mark Wahlberg?\n\n01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.200\nI might want to do that.\n\n01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.200\nHow many rounds are left?\n\n01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:12.200\nJust three-fourths.\n\n01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.200\nThree-fourths.\n\n01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.200\nWell, as far as rounds go.\n\n01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.200\nSo I guess technically two.\n\n01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.200\nI'm not good with numbers.\n\n01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.200\nOkay, so it was Ben Affleck and Mark Wahlberg, Donald Loog.\n\n01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:27.200\nI'm going to go with Donald Loog.\n\n01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.200\nNo!\n\n01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:35.200\nThat was Mark Wahlberg.\n\n01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.200\nHey, little dog.\n\n01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.200\nIt's a contextual impression.\n\n01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.200\nYou have to be talking to an animal.\n\n01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.200\nYou have to change the words.\n\n01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.200\nHey, buddy.\n\n01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.200\nHey, buddy.\n\n01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.200\nI'm Mark Wahlberg.\n\n01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.200\nAll right, Dan.\n\n01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:59.200\nYour categories to choose from are Drink the Kool-Aid or La La Royalty.\n\n01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.200\nLet's go drink the Kool-Aid.\n\n01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.200\nAll right.\n\n01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:09.200\nThis is a famous cult leader.\n\n01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:14.200\nYou gain strength, courage, confidence by every experience in which you really stop\n\n01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:17.200\nto look for fear in the face.\n\n01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.200\nYou're able to say to yourself, I live through this home.\n\n01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.200\nI can take this next thing that comes along.\n\n01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:30.200\nYou must do the thing that you think you cannot do.\n\n01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:39.200\nSo was that A, Charles Manson, B, Jim Jones, C, David Koresh?\n\n01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.200\nLet's go with the first one.\n\n01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.200\nThat is correct.\n\n01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.200\nDan pulls ahead, three to two.\n\n01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:53.200\nThat was Bob Odenkirk's impression of Charles Manson from the 1992 Ben Stiller sketch,\n\n01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.200\nwhich you should Google, watch online.\n\n01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.200\nIt's called Manson.\n\n01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.200\nIt's a lassy thing.\n\n01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.200\nIt's very funny.\n\n01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:08.200\nBethany, your choice is between La La Royalty and Come Together.\n\n01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.200\nI'm going to do Come Together.\n\n01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.200\nAll right.\n\n01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:19.200\nSo this is a beetle.\n\n01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.200\nDeath and taxes and childbirth.\n\n01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:29.200\nThere's never any convenient time for any of them.\n\n01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:33.200\nAlso, that's just a beetle.\n\n01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.200\nYou averaged all the beetles.\n\n01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.200\nThat's your impression of all of them.\n\n01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:46.200\nManson has to fill the time available for its completion.\n\n01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:53.200\nSo is that A, John Lennon, B, Ringo Starr, C, Paul McCartney, D, George Harrison?\n\n01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.200\nD, all of you both.\n\n01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:01.200\nRingo.\n\n01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.200\nPaul.\n\n01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:08.200\nThat is correct.\n\n01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:12.200\nAlways was the distinct one.\n\n01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200\nAll right.\n\n01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.200\nDan, La La Royalty or House of Incest.\n\n01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.200\nOh, is that a camera thrones thing?\n\n01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.200\nLet's go House of Incest.\n\n01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.200\nAll right.\n\n01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:30.200\nThis is a Lannister.\n\n01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.200\nPeace is not an absence of war.\n\n01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:46.200\nIt is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice.\n\n01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.200\nOh, shit.\n\n01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:55.200\nWas that A, Jamie Lannister, B, Tyrion Lannister, C, Joffrey Lannister.\n\n01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.200\nThat is correct.\n\n01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.200\nAll right.\n\n01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.200\nFinal round.\n\n01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.200\nFinal round.\n\n01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.200\nBethany, you've got to get this to stay alive.\n\n01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.200\nYou have to get this right.\n\n01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.200\nAnd I recommend you use your mail.\n\n01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.200\nBecause it's three to four right now.\n\n01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.200\nOh, okay.\n\n01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.200\nOh, and this is worth two points.\n\n01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.200\nOkay.\n\n01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.200\nAll right.\n\n01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.200\nSo you're tied.\n\n01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.200\nOh, no, no, no.\n\n01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.200\nOh, it's three to four.\n\n01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.200\nNo, if she gets it, if it's one or two.\n\n01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.200\nIf it's two, then whoever gets this right wins.\n\n01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.200\nOkay.\n\n01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.200\nUnless she gets it wrong, then I'm fine.\n\n01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.200\nYeah.\n\n01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.200\nAll right.\n\n01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.200\nI'm going to stick with my dumb suggestion.\n\n01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.200\nThat's two points.\n\n01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.200\nAll right.\n\n01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:45.200\nSo you get to choose between La Royalty or Good Day Ladies.\n\n01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.200\nGood Day Ladies.\n\n01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.200\nAll right.\n\n01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.200\nThis is an Australian actress.\n\n01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.200\nOh, boy.\n\n01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.200\nIt's an Australian actress.\n\n01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.200\nTake it away, Dan.\n\n01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.200\nHow much time he...\n\n01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:09.200\nIrish actress?\n\n01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.200\nHow much time he gains who does not look to see\n\n01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.200\nwhat the neighbor says or does...\n\n01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.200\nI want to...\n\n01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.200\nIt's bloody terrible.\n\n01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.200\nYes, it's bloody terrible.\n\n01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.200\nYou should have seen the other option.\n\n01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.200\nI'm going to take a shorter quote.\n\n01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:33.200\nYou betcha three hours too soon that a minute's too late.\n\n01:13:33.200 -->

01:22:09.200\nI haven't heard...\n\n01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.200\nNo, no, no, you don't consume much like media.\n\n01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.200\nHe's never seen the Indiana Jones movies.\n\n01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.200\nOh, well, I watch TV.\n\n01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.200\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.200\nI'm more of a TV guy than a movie guy.\n\n01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.200\nHe likes the new stuff.\n\n01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.200\nYou look like Desperate Maids.\n\n01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.200\nDesperate Maids.\n\n01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.200\nWhat was it called?\n\n01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.200\nTevious Maids, right?\n\n01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:33.200\nDesperate Maids of Orange County.\n\n01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.200\nNo, no.\n\n01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.200\nDevious Maids.\n\n01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.200\nReal Dungeon Masters of Simi Valley.\n\n01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.200\nThere's just one of them.\n\n01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.200\nThat's me.\n\n01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.200\nWell, that's how the story starts.\n\n01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:48.200\nThat's you saying that, and you're like, there's just one of them, and it's me.\n\n01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.200\nAnd you snap, and then it cuts to another guy.\n\n01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:54.200\nAnd he's like, I am the premier Dungeon Master of Simi Valley.\n\n01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.200\nAnd then the show makes you all go to a party together, and you end up pulling each other's\n\n01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.200\nhair and diving into a pool.\n\n01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:05.200\nThat does sound real.\n\n01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.200\nSo...\n\n01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.200\nDid you like the Game of Thrones you saw?\n\n01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.200\nNo.\n\n01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.200\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.200\nI'm just saying I didn't like it.\n\n01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.200\nWhy did he like it or not?\n\n01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.200\nIt's not a spoiler.\n\n01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.200\nYou Nazis.\n\n01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.200\nI didn't like it.\n\n01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.200\nYou didn't like it.\n\n01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.200\nI think it was a great episode, but I don't like it.\n\n01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.200\nI don't like a lot of great things.\n\n01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.200\nI don't like a lot of great music.\n\n01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:27.200\nNo, we honestly can't, because I was about to ask.\n\n01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.200\nI haven't seen it yet.\n\n01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.200\nI'm not going to spoil anything.\n\n01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.200\nGame of Thrones.\n\n01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:35.200\nI think everyone's going to really enjoy it.\n\n01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:40.200\nI'm just saying words to throw you guys all off guard.\n\n01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.200\nDo you understand what's going on?\n\n01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:46.200\nYeah, Dumbledore dies, right?\n\n01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.200\nHey!\n\n01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.200\nSpoiler, buddy.\n\n01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:53.200\nWere you the kid that was running around telling everyone that Dumbledore died?\n\n01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.200\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:23:54.200 --> 01:24:01.200\nWe went to the book release night at two different borders.\n\n01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.200\nDid you really do that?\n\n01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:07.200\nYeah, when you work at bookstores for a long time, you start to hate books and people who\n\n01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:10.200\nlike them.\n\n01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.200\nDid you work at a bookstore?\n\n01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.200\nBefore I worked at the used bookstore, I worked at Borders Borders.\n\n01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.200\nAre there still borders?\n\n01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.200\nNope.\n\n01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.200\nAre there still any bookstores?\n\n01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.200\nJust like vintage ones?\n\n01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.200\nThere's Barnes & Noble, you know.\n\n01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:27.200\nI wonder if they should split into a Barnes & Noble.\n\n01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.200\nI don't know why.\n\n01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:30.200\nHappy Father's Day.\n\n01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.200\nWho are Barnes & Noble?\n\n01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.200\nWhy did they put their name on it?\n\n01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.200\nYeah, fuck those guys.\n\n01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:39.200\nYeah, I'm going to find out everything about them right now.\n\n01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.200\nWho's Vaughn?\n\n01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.200\nAnd Albertson?\n\n01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:46.200\nThat goes to show you how amazing the...\n\n01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:50.200\nI do know Jason Subway, though.\n\n01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.200\nYou know that books were really popular and you couldn't take your business elsewhere\n\n01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:59.200\nbecause the bookstores' names are so shitty, like Barnes & Noble.\n\n01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.200\nYou know, if books had to be invented today, you'd have to call them something like\n\n01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:11.200\nLaser Blowjob, like the store would have to be called like Mega Max, Super Read.\n\n01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:16.200\nI publish the super dick book fuck pussy.\n\n01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.200\nSo is a Laser Blowjob really precise?\n\n01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.200\nYeah.\n\n01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.200\nOh yeah.\n\n01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.200\nIt goes right to, you know, where we like...\n\n01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.200\nNo, no, no, not that part of skin, that part of...\n\n01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.200\nIt's zero teeth.\n\n01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.200\nZero teeth.\n\n01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:33.200\nThat's the guarantee of a Laser Blowjob.\n\n01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.200\nI know.\n\n01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.200\nThose don't really exist, though.\n\n01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.200\nThat's an urban myth.\n\n01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.200\nYou've heard it a thousand times before.\n\n01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:43.200\nThis is like, I got the spokesman of the commercial, it's on an all-black set, like an onyx set,\n\n01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:46.200\nand he's walking towards camera in his gray suit.\n\n01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.200\nHe's like, like, of course, it's a blowjob.\n\n01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.200\nThere's going to be some teeth.\n\n01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.200\nThat is now a matter of the past.\n\n01:25:52.200 --> 01:26:00.200\nWith Laser Blowjobs, and then they do this CG thing, and spirals around your dick, and...\n\n01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:07.200\nAnd then it just cuts to these testimonials of guys going like, I couldn't believe it.\n\n01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.200\nYou know, you think blowjob, the little bit of teeth is okay.\n\n01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:18.200\nIt's like rat hair in your cereal.\n\n01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:24.200\nOn paper, Laser Blowjob sounds horrible.\n\n01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:31.200\nThere's a final guy that's like, it's hardly even a job anymore.\n\n01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:34.200\nI feel like I just got blown.\n\n01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:38.200\nThere's a whole, like, backlash to Laser Blowjobs that are like, you know, I like the teeth.\n\n01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.200\nI thought they were okay.\n\n01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.200\nOh, yeah, those are the hipsters.\n\n01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:47.200\nIt's somewhere like the David Cross character with the scarf.\n\n01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.200\nBlowjobs are supposed to involve teeth.\n\n01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:54.200\nThat's the point of them.\n\n01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.200\nIt makes them feel better.\n\n01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.200\nOkay, anyways.\n\n01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.200\nYeah, teeth.\n\n01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.200\nWhat, teeth?\n\n01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.200\nDon't make us drag it out of you.\n\n01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.200\nDid you bring a D&D adventure for us tonight?\n\n01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.200\nOh, yeah, I mean, I'm here.\n\n01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.200\nWell, I don't, you know, I don't assume anything about you.\n\n01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:15.200\nThat's good, that's safe.\n\n01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.200\nHave you been enjoying being my assistant?\n\n01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.200\nYes.\n\n01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.200\nConflict of interest.\n\n01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.200\nAll right, well, nothing else to talk about.\n\n01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.200\nFather's Day, did you talk to your dad today?\n\n01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:31.200\nYeah, you know, my dad's in...\n\n01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.200\nIt's in not American country.\n\n01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.200\nI'm not sure which.\n\n01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.200\nIt's terrible.\n\n01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.200\nI think it's, I think it's Columbia.\n\n01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.200\nWhy does he...\n\n01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:39.200\nMight be Brazil.\n\n01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.200\nWhy does he go?\n\n01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.200\nHe lives there now.\n\n01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.200\nWhat?\n\n01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.200\nYour dad moved to Columbia?\n\n01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.200\nYeah, you know, a lot of things happen.\n\n01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.200\nA lot of things happen.\n\n01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:49.200\nAnd you're not sure which country your dad moved to?\n\n01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.200\nWell, once it's out of America, it's like, who cares?\n\n01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.200\nI can't do anything about it.\n\n01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.200\nDid your dad move there for work?\n\n01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.200\nYeah, well, I mean, he's hoping to get work.\n\n01:27:58.200 --> 01:27:59.200\nHe's just moving there, yeah.\n\n01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.200\nI mean, my parents...\n\n01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:02.200\nThey're doing all sorts of crazy shit now, you know?\n\n01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:05.200\nMy mom's like traveling the country.\n\n01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:09.200\nI don't know, they got all this money that I'm sure I'm never going to get now.\n\n01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.200\nJust spending it on being alone.\n\n01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:17.200\nI guess.\n\n01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:20.200\nI have to be alone broke.\n\n01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.200\nSucks.\n\n01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.200\nAnyway, well, my dad sent me a letter.\n\n01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.200\nHe got, he, he, he found a pickpocket's hand in his pocket.\n\n01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.200\nAnd he punched him in the face.\n\n01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.200\nJesus.\n\n01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:32.200\nAnd it made me realize my dad has punched a lot of people in the face.\n\n01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:36.200\nLike, he punched a different guy in the face that he thought was stealing something from him.\n\n01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.200\nWe don't know if he actually was.\n\n01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:43.200\nI saw, he ripped the rear view mirror off of a car of a guy that was driving too fast in a parking lot.\n\n01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.200\nAnd then he threw it at him.\n\n01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:50.200\nHe didn't, he didn't hit the car with it, but it's just the, there's such malice there.\n\n01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:53.200\nI mean, I love my dad, but apparently violent.\n\n01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.200\nEveryone deals with divorce in different ways.\n\n01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.200\nThat was all before.\n\n01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.200\nThat's all normal.\n\n01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.200\nThat's part of the course.\n\n01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.200\nThe divorce was the mirror.\n\n01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.200\nHe should have been ripping off the car.\n\n01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:06.200\nHe was, he was coming up in unhealthy ways.\n\n01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.200\nFinally, he was like, oh, wait.\n\n01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:10.200\nI don't have to punch other men.\n\n01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.200\nI can just break up my family.\n\n01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.200\nI could punch my marriage.\n\n01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:18.200\nSo they really are separated.\n\n01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.200\nYeah.\n\n01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:21.200\nHe's in a different country.\n\n01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:22.200\nWhen did this, when did this happen?\n\n01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:23.200\nHow long ago?\n\n01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:24.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:29.200\nIt was right after he came on the show and he came up behind the table and he was like, he was going, hey, I'm Spencer's dad.\n\n01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.200\nAnd then, uh, it was after that?\n\n01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.200\nAfter that.\n\n01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.200\nI think our show broke up your parents.\n\n01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:37.200\nYeah, no, definitely.\n\n01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:44.200\nI mean, well, I was always confident that once I left, there would be nothing left because my parents were always using me as like the crutch.\n\n01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:47.200\nThey'd be like, oh, I don't know what I'm going to do about your father.\n\n01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:48.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:52.200\nAnd it's like, well, I can't be, you know, that's, that's not going to fail.\n\n01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.200\nYou guys want me out of here.\n\n01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.200\nLet's stay together for, for the kids.\n\n01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.200\nOur kids are grizzly atoms.\n\n01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.200\nYeah.\n\n01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.200\nI mean, our kids are seven feet tall.\n\n01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:07.200\nWhen all my friends' parents were getting divorced back in middle school and high school, it seems so fashionable and cool.\n\n01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.200\nLike I definitely could have cashed it in back then.\n\n01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.200\nNow it's just like fucking deal with it.\n\n01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:13.200\nYou're 25, you piece of shit.\n\n01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.200\nLike I don't have any pity anymore.\n\n01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.200\nThat's exactly right.\n\n01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.200\nOnce you hit your 20s, your parents divorcing is just kind of weird.\n\n01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.200\nYeah.\n\n01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.200\nThat's, that's how I feel about eyeglasses.\n\n01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.200\nI was like,\n\n01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:30.200\nBut, but, but sleep forward 10 years throughout my 20s, I would have been so hot with fucking glasses.\n\n01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:33.200\nI was in the fucking Costco optometrist every day.\n\n01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:35.200\nAre you sure I don't need them yet?\n\n01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:37.200\nBecause I'd be pretty hot with them.\n\n01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:40.200\nAnd like now my eyes are probably a little weaker.\n\n01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:44.200\nI'll eventually go in and I'll just look like fucking Mr. Roper.\n\n01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:46.200\nYou look like a professor.\n\n01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.200\nI'm excited about it.\n\n01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.200\nShe's getting turned on.\n\n01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.200\nOkay.\n\n01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:54.200\nWell, someone's getting a teethy blowjob.\n\n01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:55.200\nTeethy?\n\n01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.200\nI just want you to know I'm there.\n\n01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:00.200\nThat's a step up from toothy blowjob.\n\n01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.200\nTeethy.\n\n01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.200\nAll of the teeth are involved.\n\n01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:07.200\nEvery single one makes an appearance.\n\n01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:20.200\nThey can you some of the molars.\n\n01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:25.200\nNot just the vestigial blowjob tooth that like a bird uses to get out of its shell.\n\n01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:30.200\nJust wanted to know up here.\n\n01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:41.200\nThat's the sound toothy blowjob.\n\n01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:47.200\nHave either of you received such a job and not said anything and just kind of like suffered through it?\n\n01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.200\nYou don't ever say anything.\n\n01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:53.200\nYou kind of be like, hey, first of all, thank you so much.\n\n01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:56.200\nListen, forever in your death, debt, etc.\n\n01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:01.200\nDefinitely. You don't give someone notes on their performance at a soup kitchen.\n\n01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:08.200\nYou kind of an asshole with that ladle.\n\n01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.200\nOh, really?\n\n01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:13.200\nMaybe I should never come back here ever again.\n\n01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:17.200\nNo, thank you for coming down here and giving us soup.\n\n01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.200\nYou're a hero.\n\n01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:24.200\nIt's not the best soup I've ever had, but it's fucking soup.\n\n01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:30.200\nEven terrible soup is better than no soup.\n\n01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:37.200\nI think in the past, I think if somebody asks, if somebody asks for notes.\n\n01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.200\nReally?\n\n01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.200\nI'm always like A plus.\n\n01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:47.200\nAt pillow talk, if they go, do you like the way I, you know, if they are like, oh, you want to, really, you want to, I mean,\n\n01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:54.200\nand then I start with the, I go like, you're fucking aces, great, no problem.\n\n01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:55.200\nThanks for doing it.\n\n01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:06.200\nAnd then it's like, if pressed for it, if there were teeth involved, I might say, oh, I guess maybe, do you know that I don't want teeth involved?\n\n01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.200\nOh, there's one more thing.\n\n01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:14.200\nIt's super painful, isn't that kind of a crazy thing to just kind of let go?\n\n01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:18.200\nLike if someone, if someone were like, there was the other way around.\n\n01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:21.200\nListen, no one's like gnawing on your thing down.\n\n01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:22.200\nThat's not happening.\n\n01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.200\nNo, no one's gnawing on my thing.\n\n01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:27.200\nIt's just like a bit of rat hair in your cereal.\n\n01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.200\nRight, right, okay.\n\n01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.200\nSo it just comes in and, you know.\n\n01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:37.200\nYeah, I would take the worst blowjob I've ever had over the best pizza I've ever eaten.\n\n01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:42.200\nYeah, I mean, if the goal, because for some strange scientific purpose, they're like, okay, let's create the perfect blowjob.\n\n01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:45.200\nAll right, you want to go down this road, I guess we could try.\n\n01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:50.200\nBut I have a feeling the notes would result in a lot of...\n\n01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:51.200\nThere would probably be...\n\n01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.200\nNo more blowjobs.\n\n01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.200\nWell, I don't know.\n\n01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.200\nOr the next time it's like, like this?\n\n01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:58.200\nLike you said, okay, all right.\n\n01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:00.200\nYou don't have to be sarcastic.\n\n01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:04.200\nYeah, keep your blowjobs here.\n\n01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.200\nI said ballplay, not racket ball.\n\n01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:11.200\nYeah, I don't need an ironic blowjob.\n\n01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:14.200\nI wish there was a cooler term than blowjob.\n\n01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.200\nBlowjobs sound so...\n\n01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:18.200\nOr ballplay, or teethy, or anything.\n\n01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:22.200\nFirst of all, like suckjob is a much more descriptive.\n\n01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.200\nWell, do you know, I read this somewhere.\n\n01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.200\nNobody's ever blowing on that.\n\n01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:35.200\nThe etymology of the word blowjob is, they think, comes from the idea of, it's not what you think.\n\n01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:42.200\nIt's not the idea that the vendor of the merchant...\n\n01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.200\nI was going to say woman, and then I was like, 2014?\n\n01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.200\nFuck it.\n\n01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:47.200\nYeah, no, you're right.\n\n01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:48.200\nWho knows?\n\n01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:50.200\nThe vendor is way more sensitive.\n\n01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:51.200\nThe provider.\n\n01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:53.200\nThe giver, yeah.\n\n01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:59.200\nThe idea isn't that that person is doing anything.\n\n01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.200\nI mean, blowing, sucking, anything.\n\n01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.200\nIt's nothing to do with that.\n\n01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.200\nIt comes from the idea of blowing off steam.\n\n01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:10.200\nIt's the receiver blowing.\n\n01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:11.200\nThey're blowing off steam.\n\n01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:12.200\nBlowing is wad.\n\n01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.200\nBlowing is load.\n\n01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.200\nBlowing.\n\n01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.200\nYeah, it's a Victorian slang.\n\n01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.200\nIt's Victorian slang.\n\n01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:23.200\nBecause it was like a quick dirty, like, give him a blowjob.\n\n01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.200\nLet him blow off his steam.\n\n01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.200\nYeah, let him relax a little.\n\n01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:31.200\nIt's a steampunk terminology.\n\n01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:35.200\nI really think that's how they understood humanity to work,\n\n01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:37.200\nhad to do with steam.\n\n01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:38.200\nAnd it comes from that.\n\n01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:39.200\nThat's what I read.\n\n01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.200\nI was like, oh, that actually makes so much more sense\n\n01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.200\nthan all these years of going like, why do they...\n\n01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.200\nYeah.\n\n01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.200\nThat is not ever part of it.\n\n01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.200\nStop doing that.\n\n01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.200\nI'm not a balloon.\n\n01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:53.200\nYeah, I'll take teeth over that.\n\n01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:56.200\nI thought when I was a kid, I didn't know what it was.\n\n01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.200\nI'd heard the term.\n\n01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:00.200\nI thought it was that the point was for the person\n\n01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.200\nto blow air into the hole.\n\n01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:03.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.200\nAnd that's what felt really good.\n\n01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.200\nOf course you would think that.\n\n01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:08.200\nI was like, I want to do inflate all the way.\n\n01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:11.200\nOf course you would think that because when you're a kid,\n\n01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.200\nyou have a little wiener and you look down at it,\n\n01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.200\nand the obvious analog is...\n\n01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.200\nIt's like a little hole, yeah.\n\n01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.200\n...is the stem on the basketball or the tire of your dirt bike.\n\n01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:22.200\nYou're like, oh, a blowjob.\n\n01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:24.200\nI'm going to get a blowjob one day.\n\n01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.200\nOh, I guess that'll be when someone bumps me up\n\n01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:30.200\nwith this little doodad down here.\n\n01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.200\nWould that feel good?\n\n01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:34.200\nI doubt it.\n\n01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:36.200\nI bet it wouldn't feel terrible.\n\n01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.200\nI mean, yeah, in a world where...\n\n01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.200\nDoes it have like a compressed air thing\n\n01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.200\nthat you used to clean off like your keyboard?\n\n01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:44.200\nWell, that would feel weird.\n\n01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:45.200\nI bet that would feel good.\n\n01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:48.200\nI'm not talking about inserting it into the urethra\n\n01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:49.200\nI'm talking about.\n\n01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:52.200\nThree inches away, like it's a circuit board.\n\n01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:56.200\nI'm really... I'm really trying to dust it off.\n\n01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.200\nI bet it would feel good.\n\n01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:58.200\nI bet it's great.\n\n01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.200\nThere's always some splatter in that.\n\n01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.200\nYou know the liquid that's always in there?\n\n01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.200\nOh, it frees your dick.\n\n01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.200\nYeah, no, you're going to burn your dick.\n\n01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.200\nBurn it?\n\n01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.200\nYeah, like, you know, the...\n\n01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.200\nBut like a fun burn.\n\n01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.200\nThere's very little...\n\n01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:11.200\nThere's very little you can do to the dick\n\n01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:13.200\nthat would really hurt it and you'd know what it is.\n\n01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.200\nIf you're like, with this hurt it or not,\n\n01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:16.200\nit probably won't, it'll be great.\n\n01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:19.200\nThere's very little fun in burning something.\n\n01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.200\nBut it's like a freeze burn.\n\n01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.200\nLike candles.\n\n01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.200\nIt is like a freeze burn.\n\n01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.200\nI don't see your point.\n\n01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:25.200\nThat's still bad.\n\n01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.200\nNo, but listen.\n\n01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.200\nLike take down your pants.\n\n01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.200\nSomeone grab a thing.\n\n01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.200\nI mean, listen, okay.\n\n01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:32.200\nIt would feel like having your tongue stuck to a frozen pole\n\n01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:33.200\nexcept it's your dick.\n\n01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:34.200\nIt would be terrible.\n\n01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.200\nLike, you sure it's fine.\n\n01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:40.200\nI've had that spray stuff on my hand and my body.\n\n01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.200\nIt burns for minutes.\n\n01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:43.200\nYeah, it's like...\n\n01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.200\nBut it burns fun, right?\n\n01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:48.200\nIn the way that have it like inflicting pain on yourself is fun.\n\n01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:51.200\nLike sometimes you prick yourself with like a thumbtack and that's fun.\n\n01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:52.200\nIt's not...\n\n01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:54.200\nLike when you get your dick involved, that's a whole...\n\n01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.200\nOh yeah, I mean, I'm masochistic, sure.\n\n01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:00.200\nOkay, I have done that freeze thing to myself all the time.\n\n01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.200\nAnd it's like a fun burn.\n\n01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.200\nIt's not like a thumb burn.\n\n01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.200\nAre you

butt hole is pretty tiny.\n\n01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.200\nProbably.\n\n01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.200\nIsn't the idea more about the receiver's pleasure\n\n01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.200\nwhen it comes to dilating your butt hole?\n\n01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:48.200\nOh, okay.\n\n01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:49.200\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.200\nWhen you're cross-dating the

01:39:57.200\nThe reach exceeds the grasp.\n\n01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.200\nYou're like, I want something up my butt,\n\n01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:00.200\nbut my butt doesn't know that.\n\n01:40:00.200

searching forever for just...\n\n01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:32.200\nI just want a nice top-down, turn-based RPG...\n\n01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:33.200\nYeah, a little strategy.\n\n01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.200\nDungeon Crawler.\n\n01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:35.200\nIt's sort of...\n\n01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:36.200\nOberon?\n\n01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:37.200\nPokemon.\n\n01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:38.200\nOh, Pokemon.\n\n01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.200\nWait, people love the new Diablo III, I suppose.\n\n01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.200\nThat's not turn-based.\n\n01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.200\nThat's not turn-based.\n\n01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.200\nNo, fuck Dark Souls, man.\n\n01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:46.200\nI can't...\n\n01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:47.200\nYou tried that.\n\n01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.200\nIt's the Sudoku of video games.\n\n01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:52.200\nOh, I should've...\n\n01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:57.200\nI guess I'll start over, and this time I'll wear corn for a hat.\n\n01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:58.200\nThat was the old...\n\n01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:03.200\nThat was a big mistake I made that cost me three hours.\n\n01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:06.200\nThat's how your Sudoku experience is?\n\n01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:07.200\nYeah, like Sudoku.\n\n01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:09.200\nIt's like, I tried it once, and I'm like,\n\n01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.200\noh, this is kind of fun, and then I realized...\n\n01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:12.200\nYou needed a different hat.\n\n01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:13.200\nAfter six hours, I was like,\n\n01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.200\noh, I haven't been doing this right at all.\n\n01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.200\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.200\nWell, I mean, is Dustin gonna music me?\n\n01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:23.200\nAm I gonna...?\n\n01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:24.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:25.200\nAll right, here we go.\n\n01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:26.200\nSorry, everybody.\n\n01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.200\nI'm a diva.\n\n01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:30.200\nI require musical stuff.\n\n01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:37.200\nLast time on Harmontown, our heroes had made it to the Floating Isle of Paradise\n\n01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:41.200\nwith the help and unwitting sacrifice of the Seekers of Paradise.\n\n01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:45.200\nThey had arrived, and after meeting and greeting with Yomiji,\n\n01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:48.200\nthe angelic guardian of the realm,\n\n01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.200\nthey found the Tarragon of Virtue and used it to cure Christopher,\n\n01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:56.200\nunleashing the demonic and ghostly Admiral Darkstar,\n\n01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:01.200\nwho possessed Yomiji's body and compelled the angel into mortal combat.\n\n01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:04.200\nIn the fierce battle, the island caught fire,\n\n01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:08.200\nenveloping in the field of battle and blazing flames and choking smoke.\n\n01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:10.200\nThe gang resolved to escape,\n\n01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:13.200\nbut then quickly changed their minds, deciding to fight,\n\n01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:17.200\nactivating their armulets and unleashing their elemental powers.\n\n01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:23.200\nBut even Quark's sleep could not extinguish the consuming conflagration of the island.\n\n01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:26.200\nThe gang fired arrows and slashed at Yomiji,\n\n01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:28.200\nbut nothing seemed to be working.\n\n01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:32.200\nFinally, Sharpie had a quick burst of insight,\n\n01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:36.200\nand blasted the angel with reduced person,\n\n01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:38.200\nshrinking his form by half,\n\n01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:41.200\nturning the hulking arcan into an average Chad.\n\n01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.200\nBut would our heroes be able to cut down their fun-sized foe,\n\n01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.200\nor would the fun fail to free our friends from fates fiddling fingers?\n\n01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:53.200\nFind out next time on Harmontown.\n\n01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:02.200\nI guess people like alliteration.\n\n01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:05.200\nI don't like it too. It's fun.\n\n01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:07.200\nQuestions?\n\n01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:09.200\nNo, these are.\n\n01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:12.200\nWhat if we did a practical joke on Spencer,\n\n01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:15.200\nwhere we all just sat here and silenced him?\n\n01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:19.200\nI guess he would just slowly kill us with this rampaging monster.\n\n01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.200\nOkay, so distracted by your alliteration,\n\n01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:26.200\nour exact circumstances are that we shrunk this guy,\n\n01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:29.200\nbut we were going to head back for the portal, right?\n\n01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:31.200\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:33.200\nBefore the last episode, you were like,\n\n01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:35.200\nlet's run, and then at the top of the last episode,\n\n01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:38.200\nyou were like, let's not run, and then you started fighting,\n\n01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.200\nso that's what was happening.\n\n01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:43.200\nDidn't we run back for the portal, or were we just fighting this guy?\n\n01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:46.200\nYou had reduced him to half his normal size.\n\n01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:48.200\nHe's the size of a mere man.\n\n01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.200\nAlright, let's kick this guy's ass.\n\n01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:53.200\nKnowing that once we do, this spirit will be free,\n\n01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:56.200\nand that's the feudal part of it.\n\n01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:02.200\nYou stand amid the flaming isle of paradise surrounding,\n\n01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:05.200\nyou're surrounding the six-foot-tall Yomiji.\n\n01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:08.200\nIt's hard to see because smoke blocks out the sky,\n\n01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.200\nand wind whips past your faces,\n\n01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:12.200\nbut you can see the clouds above you,\n\n01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:16.200\nsoaring upwards, away from you.\n\n01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:19.200\nThen you feel a sense of vertigo as you realize\n\n01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:23.200\nthat the floating island might not be as floating as it once was.\n\n01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:24.200\nUh-oh.\n\n01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:27.200\nIn fact, it's starting to fall from the sky.\n\n01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:29.200\nOh, shh, that's bad.\n\n01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:33.200\nAnd what did we deduce about that portal last time?\n\n01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:35.200\nWhen we talked about running back into it,\n\n01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.200\nthere was shit flying out of it that was hurting us?\n\n01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.200\nWell, yeah, it looked kind of like a painful portal,\n\n01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.200\nbecause you remember the first time you went in\n\n01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:43.200\nand it sucked you through, it hurt you.\n\n01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:47.200\nAnd the final word was that it's not an option as an exit?\n\n01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:49.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:51.200\nI mean, I didn't say that, certainly.\n\n01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:54.200\nI don't know how you guys came to whatever decisions you did last week.\n\n01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:56.200\nDo any of us have tape head cleaner?\n\n01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.200\nIt might be easier to get back in that portal.\n\n01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:00.200\nGet that portal widened out, yeah.\n\n01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.200\nJust widen it up.\n\n01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:10.200\nSo we're trying to jump up into the portal?\n\n01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.200\nNo.\n\n01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.200\nWell, you're standing on this floating island.\n\n01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:14.200\nIt's on fire.\n\n01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:16.200\nYou're surrounding this angel guy who you've been fighting.\n\n01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:18.200\nWell, now we can kill him, right?\n\n01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:21.200\nCan I put out my flaming sword and attack this thing?\n\n01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:23.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:25.200\nOh, shit, I need dice.\n\n01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:29.200\nIs this tape head cleaner thing real?\n\n01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:30.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:33.200\nYeah, it's, yeah, tape head cleaner, like, yeah.\n\n01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.200\nWhen you're picking up that compressed air pickup, some of that tape, I think.\n\n01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:39.200\nNow, also, I heard the same thing about Abel Naitre Poppers,\n\n01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:42.200\nthat that's part of the effect.\n\n01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:45.200\nIt gets you high, but it also makes your butt hole get bigger.\n\n01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:46.200\nIs that right?\n\n01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.200\nI don't know.\n\n01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:49.200\nWe have a staples party we'll all find out.\n\n01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.200\nYou are rotting vociferously when he said that.\n\n01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.200\nPoppers are a real triple threat.\n\n01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.200\nBut isn't that what Gary Oldman's doing in The Professionals?\n\n01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:59.200\nSo when you watch that movie, he's like,\n\n01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:04.200\nI love Mozart, whatever it is, like, is his butt hole, like, like, dilated?\n\n01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:05.200\nYeah.\n\n01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:07.200\nHe's just shitting his pants.\n\n01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.200\nI think you're just more open to the world when your butt hole is dilated.\n\n01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:14.200\nYou're open to every, you're literally more open to the world.\n\n01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:15.200\nYeah.\n\n01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:16.200\nIn every way.\n\n01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.200\nYeah.\n\n01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:18.200\nMozart.\n\n01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:21.200\nAnything else you want to get in there?\n\n01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:24.200\nI really want to try it now after all this talk.\n\n01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.200\nWhich is a C.\n\n01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:27.200\nThat's good old fun.\n\n01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:32.200\nOkay, so I get up my flaming sword and I go and I go right at it.\n\n01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:34.200\nYou go right at it.\n\n01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:37.200\nCleaving a hefty strike directly towards his torso,\n\n01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:40.200\nbut he neatly parries with his flaming shovel.\n\n01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:43.200\nIt seems he's not out of the fight just yet.\n\n01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.200\nI think we should go into the portal.\n\n01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:48.200\nGet out of here.\n\n01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:50.200\nWe accomplished our goals.\n\n01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:51.200\nYeah, you're right.\n\n01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:54.200\nI don't want to overstate things, but yeah, we came here for a reason.\n\n01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:56.200\nParadise is fall and this guy.\n\n01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:00.200\nIf we kill him, he's got a gagu in him that goes into the next guy.\n\n01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:01.200\nAll right, yeah.\n\n01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.200\nI say we run for the fire exit.\n\n01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:04.200\nDefinitely.\n\n01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:10.200\nSometimes heroism looks identical to cowardice.\n\n01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:13.200\nBut running away from something always looks like cowardice.\n\n01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:18.200\nYeah, but if you run away long enough, you'll come back around the other side.\n\n01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:20.200\nLet's run away from...\n\n01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:22.200\nColumbus ran from Europe.\n\n01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:24.200\nLook what happened.\n\n01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:26.200\nAll right.\n\n01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:28.200\nAmerica happened.\n\n01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:31.200\nI shouldn't have to spell this out.\n\n01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:35.200\nSo you look around for the portal, but it's not where you left it.\n\n01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.200\nShit.\n\n01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.200\nYou look up.\n\n01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:40.200\nIt seems it's maybe about 20 feet and falling fast.\n\n01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:42.200\nFuck an island's falling.\n\n01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:45.200\nI tie...\n\n01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:47.200\nOkay, I have 100 feet of rope, everybody.\n\n01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.200\n100 feet of rope.\n\n01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:52.200\nI'm going to tie the rope to my foot,\n\n01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:55.200\nand then I'm going to use my boots of spry springing,\n\n01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:59.200\nand I'm going to hop up into the portal,\n\n01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:01.200\nleaving a rope behind for everybody to...\n\n01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:02.200\nI'm going to climb up.\n\n01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.200\nYeah.\n\n01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:04.200\nYeah.\n\n01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:05.200\nOkay.\n\n01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:06.200\nAll right.\n\n01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:07.200\nTada!\n\n01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:09.200\nUsing your boots of spry spring,\n\n01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:12.200\nyou spring spryly up towards the portal\n\n01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:14.200\nand grasp its razor sharp edge.\n\n01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:20.200\nYour hands are sliced by the polygons of the portal's edge,\n\n01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:23.200\nbut you catch hold, blood drips into your eyes,\n\n01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:25.200\nbut you know you're going to be able to climb through this.\n\n01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:26.200\nI am a hero!\n\n01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:27.200\nWow!\n\n01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:28.200\nWoo!\n\n01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:38.200\nYou pull yourself through into the ruined hideout\n\n01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:40.200\nof the Seekers of Paradise.\n\n01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.200\nThat's where the portal came from.\n\n01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:44.200\nYou're safe with a rope on your foot.\n\n01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.200\nGet to that rope, gentlemen.\n\n01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:51.200\nThe rope's being, you know, pulled by the falling,\n\n01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:52.200\nbut you get it.\n\n01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.200\nWho wants to get it?\n\n01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:54.200\nWe all do.\n\n01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.200\nYeah.\n\n01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:56.200\nWho goes first?\n\n01:52:56.200 --> 01:53:01.200\nWell, as a tortured artist in this falling rock of paradise,\n\n01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:03.200\nI'm kind of like the band in Titanic.\n\n01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.200\nI feel like I should sing Lady in Red\n\n01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:07.200\nas this thing falls to its death.\n\n01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:09.200\nAnd steps are giving me a good send-off.\n\n01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:11.200\nBut I also go for the rope.\n\n01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:12.200\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:13.200\nOkay, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.200\nAlso the rope.\n\n01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:15.200\nJust making sure.\n\n01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:16.200\nMaybe it was cool.\n\n01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:17.200\nLet me go last.\n\n01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:21.200\nI can use my teleport cape to grab it no matter how high it goes.\n\n01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:24.200\nSo you guys go before me.\n\n01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.200\nI feel like I should mention that.\n\n01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:27.200\nThat's used up for the time.\n\n01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:28.200\nFuck you.\n\n01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:33.200\nYou're such a fucking dungeon master.\n\n01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:36.200\nIt's like I enforce some rules.\n\n01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:37.200\nAll right, fine.\n\n01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:38.200\nI grab the rope.\n\n01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:42.200\nI kick everyone out of the way.\n\n01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:44.200\nYou grab the rope first.\n\n01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.200\nIt's gonna be Father's Day.\n\n01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:50.200\nYou guys continue to grab different parts of the rope.\n\n01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.200\nI don't know why I'm describing that.\n\n01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:56.200\nAs you sing a soulful melody.\n\n01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:57.200\nI do.\n\n01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:00.200\nLady in red.\n\n01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.200\nIt's a great song.\n\n01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:03.200\nYou see the island fall away from you\n\n01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:05.200\nas Yomichi looks up going,\n\n01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:08.200\nGEEEW!\n\n01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:13.200\nAnd then he realizes he has wings and flies away.\n\n01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:17.200\nYou guys are just hanging from a hole in the sky.\n\n01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:19.200\nCan we crawl up it?\n\n01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:20.200\nYeah.\n\n01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:22.200\nWe destroyed a whole island.\n\n01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:23.200\nIt's okay.\n\n01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:26.200\nDon't think about the past.\n\n01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:27.200\nI can't.\n\n01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:29.200\nIt's gone.\n\n01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:32.200\nSo yeah, you guys pull yourself up into this portal.\n\n01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:34.200\nYou each take some damage though.\n\n01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:38.200\nIt's okay.\n\n01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:44.200\nMulraine takes five, not Christopher, but Quark takes eight.\n\n01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:47.200\nChristopher takes one and you take two.\n\n01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:49.200\nGot off easy.\n\n01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:52.200\nSo you pull yourselves into the ruined.\n\n01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:53.200\nWhat do you call it?\n\n01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:54.200\nHideout.\n\n01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:55.200\nWhat did I call it?\n\n01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:57.200\nHideout of the Seekers of Paradise.\n\n01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:58.200\nIt looks like a bomb went off.\n\n01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:00.200\nAll the things, there's furniture.\n\n01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.200\nIt's sheared in half.\n\n01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:03.200\nEverything's just shattered and exploded.\n\n01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:08.200\nAnd half the stuff that used to be in the room has just gone completely.\n\n01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:10.200\nThis is shitty in here.\n\n01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:14.200\nThe portal still stands though, just kind of like an open sore in the sky.\n\n01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:18.200\nAnd there's nobody else in here except for us, right?\n\n01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:24.200\nWell, you do see that, you know, scattered mutilated body parts of the gnomes\n\n01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:27.200\nthat exploded when you unleashed that portal.\n\n01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.200\nI searched their bodies.\n\n01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:30.200\nJesus.\n\n01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:31.200\nYou see it.\n\n01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:33.200\nListen, we're just being practical.\n\n01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:35.200\nWe should have been searching bodies all along.\n\n01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:40.200\nI put pennies on their eyelids and looked for letters to their parents.\n\n01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.200\nNo.\n\n01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:47.200\nYou see, there's a torso that seems to have a long dagger, a coin purse,\n\n01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:51.200\nas well as a small sketch of us, of a female gnome.\n\n01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:54.200\nWe take everything except for the sketch.\n\n01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:58.200\nThe other gnomes don't have anything or it's been removed from their body.\n\n01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:00.200\nI want to take the sketch.\n\n01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:01.200\nOkay.\n\n01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:03.200\nI take the sketch and I make it into a necklace.\n\n01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:07.200\nBecause maybe later someone will be like, oh, I know her, you know.\n\n01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.200\nWait, do you do the necklace now or is it just going to make a necklace?\n\n01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:12.200\nVery fast.\n\n01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:13.200\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:15.200\nYou make a necklace of the sketch.\n\n01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:18.200\nCan you describe the sketch a little bit?\n\n01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:20.200\nIt's pretty shitty to be honest.\n\n01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.200\nI mean, this guy was obviously no artist.\n\n01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:29.200\nBut the sentiment shows through, you know, they're obviously a gnome.\n\n01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:36.200\nI got to tell you the truth, my OCD, like, I wanted to come in through the portal\n\n01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:41.200\nand say to anybody who was waiting on the other side, do not go in there.\n\n01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:43.200\nDo not go in there.\n\n01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:44.200\nLike that?\n\n01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:47.200\nAnd I couldn't, like, I was like, is there anyone else here?\n\n01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.200\nShit.\n\n01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:49.200\nYou should have said it.\n\n01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:50.200\nI didn't want to carry it around with me.\n\n01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:51.200\nThat would have been a great life.\n\n01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.200\nSo now it's done and just forget it.\n\n01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:53.200\nBut you know what?\n\n01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:54.200\nWe all appreciate the life.\n\n01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:55.200\nThank you.\n\n01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:56.200\nYeah.\n\n01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:57.200\nWe get the same joy from that.\n\n01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:59.200\nWe all come back in and do the build.\n\n01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:00.200\nYeah.\n\n01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:01.200\nNo, but pretend we did.\n\n01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:02.200\nWe just got here.\n\n01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:03.200\nOkay.\n\n01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:04.200\nNow say it.\n\n01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:05.200\nDo not go in there.\n\n01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:06.200\nOh!\n\n01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:11.200\nFather's Day.\n\n01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:12.200\nAll right.\n\n01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:18.200\nWell, we ought to get out of this building and get back to our lives.\n\n01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:20.200\nWait, we're just going home?\n\n01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:26.200\nWell, I mean, this is the culmination of a big long campaign for us.\n\n01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:27.200\nYeah.\n\n01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:29.200\nWe've only got Kumail's character free of curses.\n\n01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:32.200\nGod, it feels so good.\n\n01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:35.200\nHe has no dick still.\n\n01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:36.620\nDidn't I get a better dick though?\n\n01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:39.200\nYou have a dragon dick in your bag.\n\n01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:40.200\nTrue.\n\n01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:44.700\nI didn't want to do it myself, but I think you should attach the dragon dick where your\n\n01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:46.200\nreal dick would be.\n\n01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:47.200\nOh, most definitely.\n\n01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:48.840\nI have your blessing.\n\n01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:54.200\nI would like to attach the dragon dick on the stump of my former dick.\n\n01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:56.200\nLike just yourself?\n\n01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:58.200\nWhat do I have?\n\n01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:02.200\nYou're going to need dick husbandry.\n\n01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:04.200\nYou can borrow a needle and thread.\n\n01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:05.200\nMay I?\n\n01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:06.200\nThat doesn't sound right.\n\n01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:09.200\nYou're probably going to gnome to do it, like a team of gnomes.\n\n01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:11.200\nYeah, Bill Martikins has a lot of cool gnomes.\n\n01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:12.200\nLet's go look around.\n\n01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:13.200\nWe'll see if we can find someone.\n\n01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:18.800\nWell, step outside this building into the daylight and stretch our arms, and we hear\n\n01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:25.800\nthe full-lead sounds of wagons clipping and clopping, it's like deadwood sound library\n\n01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:28.800\nstuff, a little background chatter.\n\n01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:33.800\nOh, man, two gold pieces for that.\n\n01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:37.800\nGet your coffins here.\n\n01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:44.800\nAnd you find yourselves out front of a, what is it now, Spizwad's weird bungalow, the\n\n01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:48.800\nmagical fellow from before, he got you to steal all those cigarettes.\n\n01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:51.800\nI guess he didn't steal them, but you know, whatever.\n\n01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:53.800\nHe was going to help you magically.\n\n01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:55.800\nHe might be a guy.\n\n01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:59.800\nIs he going to be upset because we just came out of a building with like gnome body parts\n\n01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:00.800\nin it?\n\n01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.800\nWe're not going to tell him.\n\n01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:07.800\nI hide my picture.\n\n01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:11.800\nYeah, let's get our story straight about this.\n\n01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:17.800\nWe went to a secret gnome meeting where they play with buttons at open portals.\n\n01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:19.800\nThat's on them.\n\n01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:25.800\nWe were there when it happened, but we just leave out the parts where we did anything.\n\n01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:29.800\nI mean, overall, what are we doing?\n\n01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:31.800\nDo we have a mission for good?\n\n01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:33.800\nAre we just always trying to save our own necks?\n\n01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:34.800\nDo we have a...\n\n01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:35.800\nJesus.\n\n01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:36.800\nWow.\n\n01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:38.800\nThat is intense.\n\n01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:42.800\nThis world barely has plumbing and you're asking questions like that.\n\n01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:43.800\nI'm impressed.\n\n01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:49.800\nI mean, I've seen a lot of shit on this trip, obviously.\n\n01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:54.800\nI just imagine that you were petting my head, I guess.\n\n01:59:54.800 --> 02:00:02.800\nThis is one of those rare moments between campaigns where we finished our shit and we\n\n02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:05.800\nwere not beleaguered by anything else.\n\n02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:06.800\nIt's nice.\n\n02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:07.800\nYeah.\n\n02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.800\nWe've been through a lot together.\n\n02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:16.800\nCan we all write down the scariest thing that's happened, the worst thing that's happened\n\n02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:22.800\non this trip on a little piece of parchment and just sit around a fire and talk about\n\n02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:28.800\nit and just throw it in the fire and let it go?\n\n02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:29.800\nYeah.\n\n02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:31.800\nI mean, do you want to build a fire now?\n\n02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:32.800\nYeah.\n\n02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:41.800\nIt seems like this is a good point to sort of end.\n\n02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:43.800\nBut I mean, it's a little sleepy.\n\n02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:45.800\nIt is a little sleepy.\n\n02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:51.800\nThere's no reason for anybody to tune back.\n\n02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:55.800\nI pretend that I see a woman in a red cloak up the road.\n\n02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:57.800\nIs that the lady?\n\n02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:01.800\nIt is the lady in red.\n\n02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:02.800\nMonica!\n\n02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:03.800\nNope.\n\n02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:04.800\nOkay.\n\n02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:05.800\nAll right.\n\n02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:06.800\nAll right.\n\n02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:14.800\nI go into the nearest tavern.\n\n02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:19.800\nYou enter the nearest tavern, a place by the name of the Rusty Buckle.\n\n02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:20.800\nWhat's up?\n\n02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:22.800\nI follow women.\n\n02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:23.800\nAs do I.\n\n02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:28.800\nYou just see three gnomes and what looks like a baby standing around a table.\n\n02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:30.800\nThere's no one else in the room.\n\n02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:33.800\nIs it an adult gnome that looks like a baby?\n\n02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:36.800\nIt just looks like a baby.\n\n02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:37.800\nIt's a baby gnome.\n\n02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:41.800\nFellas, I see your baby is standing.\n\n02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:43.800\nNot standing.\n\n02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:44.800\nNo.\n\n02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:46.800\nHe's in a bassinet?\n\n02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:47.800\nYeah.\n\n02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:48.800\nOkay.\n\n02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:49.800\nDoes he need a drink?\n\n02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:50.800\nWhat are you guys drinking?\n\n02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:51.800\nWhat are you drinking?\n\n02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:52.800\nWhat are you drinking?\n\n02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:53.800\nGnomes.\n\n02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:54.800\nGnomes.\n\n02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:55.800\nGnomes?\n\n02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:56.800\nAll right.\n\n02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:57.800\nGnomes?\n\n02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:58.800\nYeah.\n\n02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:01.800\nDo you want to have a naps blue ribbon?\n\n02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:02.800\nYeah.\n\n02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:04.800\nThey definitely do.\n\n02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:06.800\nA round of noors for my gnome friends.\n\n02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:09.800\nI'll get a metal one.\n\n02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:10.800\nOn the shrug.\n\n02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:12.800\nHe gets it.\n\n02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:15.800\nBut yeah, so you get them around.\n\n02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:16.800\nThey're like, thanks.\n\n02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:19.800\nWe're going to go back to looking at our shit.\n\n02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:21.800\nWhat are you guys looking at?\n\n02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:22.800\nYour baby?\n\n02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:23.800\nNo, no.\n\n02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:24.800\nJust the plans for them.\n\n02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:26.800\nAre you going to plan for a baby?\n\n02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:28.800\nI mean, yeah, yeah.\n\n02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:29.800\nThe baby's already there.\n\n02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:30.800\nYou don't need to plan it anymore.\n\n02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:31.800\nYeah.\n\n02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:33.800\nThe baby just didn't get here without planning.\n\n02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:34.800\nHow did it?\n\n02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:37.800\nWait, so you're going over the plans for the baby that's here?\n\n02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:38.800\nYes.\n\n02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:40.800\nLet me take a look at these.\n\n02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:47.800\nIt's a detailed multi-layered blueprint schematic that you don't even begin to understand.\n\n02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:50.800\nBut on the first page, you see something that looks like an eyeball.\n\n02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:52.800\nI get this.\n\n02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:54.800\nYou guys make babies?\n\n02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:55.800\nYeah.\n\n02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:57.800\nWait, Kork, you're a gnome.\n\n02:02:57.800 --> 02:02:59.800\nWhat was your plan when you were born?\n\n02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:02.800\nI mean, I just came out.\n\n02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:04.800\nI didn't really have a plan.\n\n02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:06.800\nAre these plans to make the baby?\n\n02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:09.800\nOr when the baby happens, did the plans for the baby's life?\n\n02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:11.800\nNo, these are the plans to make this.\n\n02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:13.800\nI mean, you guys keep calling it a baby.\n\n02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:14.800\nI guess it looks like a baby.\n\n02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:16.800\nIt's more like a little automaton.\n\n02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:20.800\nOh, it's a cyborg baby.\n\n02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.800\nWhat's a cyborg?\n\n02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:23.800\nA cyborg?\n\n02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:24.800\nIs that like a golem?\n\n02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:25.800\nIs it like an android?\n\n02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:26.800\nYeah, it's like a golem.\n\n02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:27.800\nWhat's an android?\n\n02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:29.800\nIt's like a golem.\n\n02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:30.800\nIt's like a golem.\n\n02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:33.800\nMr. Gnome, is there somewhere where I can buy one?\n\n02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:35.800\nNo, no, you just got to make them.\n\n02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:37.800\nOkay, can I get the recipe?\n\n02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:40.800\nWell, we have these plans, but they're very costly.\n\n02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:41.800\nHow costly?\n\n02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:43.800\n800 gold.\n\n02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:48.800\nI think what we should do, and this is a crazy, crazy pitch,\n\n02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:54.800\nlet's take the baby golem and fucking run out of here.\n\n02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:55.800\nI'm down.\n\n02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:57.800\nWell, can we at least steal the plans?\n\n02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:59.800\nNah, come on, guys.\n\n02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:01.800\nWe're not saying this in front of these guys.\n\n02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:05.800\nCan we talk over by the gnome equivalent of a jukebox?\n\n02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:09.800\nLook, I mean, I don't give a fuck what you say to me.\n\n02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:11.800\nI'm going to steal those plans.\n\n02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:13.800\nAnd I don't care what the fuck you're going to say to me.\n\n02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:15.800\nI'm taking that babe.\n\n02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:20.800\nCan I impress upon you guys that we've been through a lot this year?\n\n02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:22.800\nHow much better would it be?\n\n02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:24.800\nListen, imagine your life right now.\n\n02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:29.800\nNow imagine it with a baby robot.\n\n02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:31.800\nIt's only better.\n\n02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:34.800\nThese gnomes, they helped us.\n\n02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:36.800\nWe killed them already.\n\n02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:40.800\nWell, then what's a few more?\n\n02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:42.800\nWe're already here.\n\n02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:43.800\nWe're not killing them.\n\n02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:46.800\nWe're just taking their baby robot.\n\n02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:49.800\nI'm sure we have 800 gold pieces between us.\n\n02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:50.800\nYou really don't.\n\n02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:54.800\nI draw my bow and I point it at the gnomes and I say,\n\n02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:56.800\ngive me the plans, little ones.\n\n02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:58.800\nWhat the fuck?\n\n02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:00.800\nGive me the plans.\n\n02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:02.800\nThey slowly, like, hold their hands up.\n\n02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:04.800\nLike, just be careful, you know.\n\n02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:05.800\nThey're on the table.\n\n02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:06.800\nYeah, all right, all right.\n\n02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:08.800\nI'm really sorry about this.\n\n02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:11.800\nQuirk, Quirk, grab the plans and grab the baby.\n\n02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:13.800\nAll
