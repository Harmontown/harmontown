00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Zero audio.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Hello, yes. Welcome to Nermal Theatre at Meltdown Comics.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Harmontown is now in session. I'm your guest comptroller, Camel Nanjiani.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Please welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Alright, thank you.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
It's good to see things are already under comptrol.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Well, it's funny because you were like, how can you fuck this up?

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
I didn't. I mean, this was the first mic I was trying to use. There's nothing attached.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah, we've had a couple guest comptrollers and people want to know.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
You can sense that they want to do the job right as opposed to wrong and stuff,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
and I always am tickled by the notion that you could do it wrong,

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
because this crowd, I mean, forget it, these guys, they're just lovers.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
They don't care. That could have gone on for 20 minutes.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
They would have watched you change batteries in a flashlight.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
I think they had jumped off board. 30 seconds in.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
No way. Did you guys jump off board?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
You shouldn't ask a negative question.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Did you guys fail to jump off board?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Yeah, right!

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
That's a technique telemarketers use,

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
is they always ask questions where the answer can only possibly be yes.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
They'll call you up and go, do you love the lady of the house or something?

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Do you enjoy long distance?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Do you enjoy long distance?

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
They'll say things that the answer in your brain can't be no,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
so they get you saying yes, and they get you saying yes a lot.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Oh, that's smart! Do you like ice cream?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Hitler was a bad guy, right?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Yes, yes! How's your home security?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
I'll take it!

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
So, speaking of security, you were in a hot air balloon on Twitter.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
It wasn't just on Twitter, it was on my regular life also.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I was in the physical world on a hot air balloon.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
But did you really get into a hot air balloon?

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, I got into a hot air balloon and I realized it is exactly what it says it is.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
It's not helium or anything, it's just a hot air balloon.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
It's air and they heat it and if you stop heating it, you die.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah, you crash.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
But if the propane ran out, whatever they're using to make the torch go,

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
it wouldn't be like a plane running out of gas, you would just float down to the ground, right?

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
Yes, but there's no steering wheel on it, so you land in the middle of a highway and then you're dead.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I wonder what the statistics are on hot air balloons.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I think 50% of the people die.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
It's always such a peaceful, seeming mode of transportation,

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
whether they get the smile faces or it's a garfield floating over the trees,

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
but I bet they do that to compensate.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I bet it's like base jumping, I bet people lose their heads and shit.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Oh yeah, 50% of people die.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
I saw the balloon that they were inflating and it had all these little pieces of tape on it.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I was like, what? Use the one that has no holes in it.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
They're patching up holes.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
I want the new hot air balloon for sure.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
You know, you can take a little bit of nail polish though and put it on there.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
What does nail polish do?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
It just stops the run in the balloon.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Something I learned from McCalls.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
What's McCalls?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
It's a magazine.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Do you guys know McCalls?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Some people do.

04:12.000 --> 04:23.000
I'm not from here, so a lot of this is going to be you explaining basic pop cultural things.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
So it's Father's Day.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
You know what that is, right?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Just from the name I can surmise.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Do they have Father's Day in Pakistan?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Not really.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
But now he gives a shit, you know, now I have to call.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
He didn't know what it was two years ago, but now very upset that I didn't send flowers.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I sent flowers to my dad, but I don't know that he got them.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
I texted the number I had for my dad in my phone and I was thinking about something else

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
and I looked at the text that I sent my dad and it said, Happy Birthday.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
There's so many sadnesses in that sentence.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
The number I had for my dad is maybe the saddest phrase in the English language.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
So then I immediately followed it up with dot dot dot to all fathers.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Did he respond?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
No.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
But I don't think it was his number.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
I don't know.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
How often are you texting that number?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I don't text him a lot.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
My mom has my text message, but my mom was getting eye surgery for her cataracts

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
and she was communicating with me through Twitter direct messages,

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
which come to me as text messages because I'm subscribed to the service.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
And then after a while I'm like, you have my text?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
I don't know, it's weird.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Your mom's on Twitter?

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
She has an account that's locked with two followers, me and my aunt,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
that she uses to just, I think, read tweets.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
She doesn't want to be tweeting nothing or having anybody tweeting at her.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
How many people does she follow?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Does she follow people?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
I think she just follows me and my aunt.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I think me and my aunt follow her and I think that's it.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
My mother-in-law has a Twitter account.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
It has one tweet and so her cousin, her name's Elizabeth Long

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
and her Twitter handle is Elizabeth Bitch Long.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
She's 18, it's okay.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Elizabeth Bitch Long and the only, so my grandmother,

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
my mother-in-law was trying to follow her, but she didn't succeed

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
and the only tweet she has is Elizabeth Bitch Long.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
It's the only...

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
It's just her trying to type it in.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
She typed it in wrong.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Elizabeth Bitch Long, not Elizabeth Bitch Long.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Elizabeth Bitch Long and just tweet and she's like,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I give up and it's still outside.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
It's just so confusing.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Already that's happening to me at 41 but just in ways that are very specific

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
but one day just normal public life is going to be that.

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
Like everything's going to feel profane and arch and inaccessible

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
and exhaustive, right?

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Because you can imagine this poor person typing,

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
so what do I...

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
I have to type the at symbol and then I have to type her name

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
and then the word bitch.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
This is how I'm allowed to love her with my computer.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
It must seem so overwhelming.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I remember my grandpa before he died.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
It was really impressively like using his new Macintosh

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
to balance the Freemason spreadsheet for his local chapter.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
He's got his little glasses perched on his nose

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
and his little mouse is moving it around

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
and you can tell these are hands that clutched bloody bayonets

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
at Guadalcanal, you know, thrusting and removing from the enemy.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
The blood gutters spraying arterial mist into the air

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
as he shouted to the clouds,

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Freedom!

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Only to come back home and just find out,

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
now they make the cars for us?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah, with the left click and the right click.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Different things.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
There's two buttons on the mouse now.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I just learned with the one button.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
That was back when it was like the idea of the mouse was ridiculous.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Remember that Star Trek movie where Scotty picks up the mouse

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
and he talks into it, hello computer.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Anyways, you never talk about your dad really.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
You talked about your parents as a set.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
They have a unified front.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
They have made a decision and they're sticking with it.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I'll talk about my dad.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
My dad is sort of like the funny guy in the family.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
He would always be doing like jokes.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
He does jokes about that.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
What's that ethnic group?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Patan?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Is your dad the first with a snappy patan joke?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah, that's exactly the kind of jokes he would do.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And he would actually do a lot of like fart and shit jokes.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And to this day I don't think they're funny

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
and I think that's my rebellion against him.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Can you tell us just one joke that your dad really likes?

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
He would always say that if you ate bubblegum you would shit like a yo-yo.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
And I would be like, dad, that is not funny.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
And I still think it's not funny because he said it.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
That seems like a good segue into the realm of conspiracy theories.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Because you just launched a podcast on the...

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Oh yeah, I'm doing a podcast called The X Files Files

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
on Feral Audio.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
It's going to be about The X Files.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
It's for almost nobody.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
What do you mean, going to be? You're on your cover?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
It is, yeah. Well, episode three comes out. Dan is on it.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
It's a really great episode.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
It's episode four of The X Files, episode three of the podcast.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I go by X Files, I go by X Files.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Very poorly thought out.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
This is going to be confusing and inaccessible by design.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
It came out of the gate very successful.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
I only have one experience with one podcast, which also came out of the gate very successful.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Thank you.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I just...

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Do new podcasts always kind of end up on the front pages and the things because of their algorithm?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Not always, but I think what they do, I choose the algorithm.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I don't know if this is interesting.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
If you're just tuning in to the podcast file file.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
I was going to say the podcast cast, but that's an actual podcast.

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
The weight weights new subscribers more than existing subscribers.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
If I get a hundred more, that means more.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
That sends me up higher up the charts than someone who has thousands of subscribers.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
So in the beginning you end up higher because you're getting new subscribers and new reviews and stuff more.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
It's like a gold rush. It's like a manifest destiny.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
It's like they're incentivizing settlers.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
It is exactly that.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Because I was like, I'll just do this and I'll do it every now and then. Who cares?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
And then they're like, wow, you're really good at this.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Which is what Scientology says to you.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Exactly.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Or like when you draw a tippy turtle for the art school thing.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
And you send in your shittyly drawn turtle and you always get back.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I think it goes, whoa, stop the press.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
Michelangelo, I think you might be good enough to give us $5,000.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Check to your parents.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
That's a good looking turtle.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
That is exactly what this was.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
It was number one in comedy for like 10 days.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
And then you're like, wait, why is it 11 now?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah, what happened?

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
I'll tell you, I was very happy for the few days it was above Marin's podcast.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
I flirted with taking a screenshot and sending it to him.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
But I knew I would regret it for the rest of my days.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
He's got to be so sick of that.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
He's like a yield sign in some hillbilly highway.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
He's just filled with buckshot.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
Everyone that drives by, everyone that has a new podcast is going to like take that screenshot of it.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
I beat Marin.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Well, it's not really true.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Well, not everybody who gets a new podcast gets to beat Marin.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Just very, you know, rare, X-Files based podcasts get to do that.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
Alright, so your dad, he's a, I picture him in a wife beater.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
No.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
How is it chain smoking?

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
We used to smoke, quit, start it up again, quit.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
It's a struggle.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
I picture him as Tony Shalube.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Who am I kidding?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
You picture him as Tony Shalube.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Quick change and that's racist.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
No, monk, monk baby.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
I think your dad is a super intelligent mentally ill detective.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
He is very intelligent.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
He's a psychiatrist.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
He's a psychiatrist.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
He is sort of Shalube in the face.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
He's a little Shalube.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
What nationality Shalube?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Is he Lebanese?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Why don't you know?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Tony?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
His first name is Tony.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
I think he's Italian.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
No, no, no, no.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Armenian maybe?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
I don't think he's Armenian.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
He's not Armenian?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
No, Shalube is like, someone's on it.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
He's Lebanese.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
There's a couple of years ago in Michigan, he came to Flint to receive from our community college,

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Lebanese American of the Year.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
He won Lebanese American of the Year.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Who is winning it the other years?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
You would think Shalube would have a lock on that.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Who is winning?

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
He's the Hulk Hogan of Lebanese Americans for sure.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
He certainly is.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
This guy, the friend said, is Shalube from Michigan?

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
I don't think so, but Michigan has a high population of...

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
He came to Flint and won Lebanese American of the Year.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
That's just like Flint's economy is so downtrodden that they're like,

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
maybe we could be the Lebanese capital of the world.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Hey, I have a client to get Tony Shalube in here.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
They should just rename it the Tony Shalube Award.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Tony Shalube every year.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
That's like, the mayor of Flint is in this meeting and he's like,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
he's just looking at all these charts and hearing all these terrible things.

14:39.000 --> 14:46.000
And then at this point, actually Newsweek has now classified Flint, Michigan as a third world city.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
And the mayor goes, wait a minute.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
What if we embraced that?

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
What if we were the premier third world destination in America?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
What could make third world world?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
You come here, you buy a ticket.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Tony Shalube is there, you shake his hand.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Are you hungry? There's no food.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
That'll be eight dollars, please.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
The water is brown and AIDS is everywhere.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
But probably really fast Wi-Fi.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Somebody said something about Wi-Fi.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
I was like, that's my dish on American Wi-Fi speeds.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
People are off board.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Are you guys getting back off board?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
I'm off board.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
All right.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
What did you guys do to celebrate?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Like, he came.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
I'm going to repeat some people back in here.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
He did a talk.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
He talked about being on Monk and Wings.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
And then there was a luncheon, of course.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
I mean, you don't have to walk me through everything.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
This is the Lebanese of the year awards.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
I know how this goes.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Of course, there's a luncheon, there's hummus.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Let me guess.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
All the people were really there before.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
I didn't see him get a trophy or anything.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
You were there?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
You were there.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Everybody in Flint went.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Or was it like a hot ticket item on Craigslist?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Did you have to go find it?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I got to go because I was a student at the Community College.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
You were a student at the Community College?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I had a CC, that's what got me there.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Wait, so he came to the Community College?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Community College.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Wow.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
I want to get Tony Shalu about this show.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I mean, he's a good actor.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Oh, he's been great forever.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
We talked about this.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
We talked about Shalu.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I told you about his performance in Quick Change

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
because we were talking about you having to go in for roles

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
where people are like, oh, this guy's kind of like the guy on...

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Yeah, exactly.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Simpsons.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Yeah, Simpsons.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
It's always Simpsons.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
They want me to do the voice that a white guy did,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
pretending to be what I actually am,

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
which is Pakistani, but you know, we're the same.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
I remember when Ben...

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
like some time in the vicinity of 9-11

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
when everyone was still really amped up,

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Ben Affleck being on The Daily Show,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
and it was...

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
you would think that Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
would make easy comedic targets for Ben Affleck,

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
but he's on The Daily Show and he kind of like...

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
I remember he was like...

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
he was making some observation about like...

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
I think it was something like,

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
like, oh, they closed Disneyland.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
They're worried about Disneyland.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Like these guys are, you know,

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
like they're going to go, oh, what should we bomb now?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
And he did this voice.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
He launched into this like a poo voice.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
That kind of went mildly, as Jeff Davis would say.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
I just thought it was really funny.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
He's like, we just got attacked on this guy,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
can't land an Al-Qaeda joke.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
They're like, yeah, they flew planes into us,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
but that's a bit much.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Alright, anyways.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
So my dad is a very, very smart guy.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
He's got a tattoo.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
He doesn't have any tattoos that I know of.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
He's bald.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
He has no hair on his head.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
And then he started shaving.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
He looks cool.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
He's a psychiatrist.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
I've said that.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
I'm realizing I don't know him very well.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
All the things I'm saying about him are stuff

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
you could find on his Facebook page.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Are you scared of him?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Not like he's under your bed,

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
but just like, are you scared of making him upset?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Like if you say something in an interview,

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
are you scared?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
My dad's not the scary one.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
My mom's the enforcer.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Because you feel like you'll have emotional hell to pay if she...

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
If I had to guess is that my dad would not be...

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Like my mom's very, very religious.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
They're both very religious.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Sometimes I get the sense that if they weren't together,

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
my dad would not be as religious.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
So I think...

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
So that is interesting,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
but it's unfortunately a conversation we're never going to have.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
All right.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
You mean here tonight?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Should I call him?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Come on.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I mean, what's the deal with Muhammad, right?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Just me and you and a hundred other people

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
and then thousands tomorrow when it goes up.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Is that...

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Well, I think it's both.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
It's a stereotype and it's fact

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
that fathers and sons have these weird communications.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
There's so much like tension

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
that's unspoken and unexpressed.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
You mean, is it like a competitive thing?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
I'll say this.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
I would think that you...

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Okay, you grew up in Pakistan.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
You came here.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
You had to...

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
I'm treading carefully here.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
No, no, no. Go for it.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
You feel yourself as kind of like you've achieved

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
escape velocity from something

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
that has a certain membrane around it.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
You're speaking about your dad as a psychiatrist.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
He's an intelligent man.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
You just kind of summed up there

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
and a very important thing.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
Like maybe your dad also would achieve that escape velocity.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
Like he is this genetic blueprint of you.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
That's how we all...

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
And you haven't talked about it with him.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Yeah.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
I don't know.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
The idea of...

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Earlier today, I was imagining

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
this is what my fantasies are,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
having like a real conversation with my parents

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
where we share our feelings

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
and I almost got nauseous.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
It was so outside my reality to be like,

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
well, how do you really feel about this?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Like if my dad ever said to me,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
I'm proud of you,

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
I would like really, really...

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
It just doesn't feel like part of reality.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Like if I would be like,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
what did you do with my dad, Tony Shalu?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Because...

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
It's so outside of...

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Just him saying that to me made me feel embarrassed.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Like my face turned red.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Just me thinking about that idea.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
But it's not for him, for yourself.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
For myself, yeah.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Because it's something that's so...

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
It's like all of a sudden you're in a bathtub

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
and someone's washing your little hinder quarters.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Right.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Like it's too intimate, it's too emotional.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
But part of it I know is that it would take

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
so much effort for him to say that,

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
that I would feel guilty for making him make that effort.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Yeah, yeah.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
My dad told me,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
I think I've told the story before, like there was...

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
It was back when we were just...

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
The only thing I had going was Channel 101 pilot

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
for Acceptable TV and for VH1

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
and all the Channel 101 kids.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
I watched that show, that show was great.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Before you.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Before we knew each other.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Not before you.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Well they fired me for a season and the sketches were...

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Wait, there were two seasons?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
No, no, no, I'm kidding.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
We had a party to celebrate Acceptable TV being on VH1,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
so it was all the Channel 101 kids

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
and we all felt kind of like we did it.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
We did something.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
We built something together.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
We're going to have a TV show.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
How could this ever go wrong?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
And a whole bar full of them.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
And my parents just happened to be visiting

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
and my dad...

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
I got too late for them because they're old folk

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
and I walked them to their car.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
They were going to go to the hotel

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
and they're in the parking lot behind the Club TG

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
in Glendale.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
My dad said,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I didn't even realize I'd been waiting to hear it.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
He was like,

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
all those people in there,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
they're all there because of you.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
They really look up to you.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Very proud of you.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
I was like,

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
okay, all right, cool.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Yeah, thanks, man.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Have a safe drive home.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
I'm going to go explode in a urinal.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
It's like that moment in...

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Not coming.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I just meant I would be seeking privacy

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
and there would probably be a urinal there.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
I didn't mean I would come.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Although, I don't know.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Maybe I would come.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
I don't know what reaction my body would have

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
if my dad said that to me.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
It's sort of like what you described in that moment

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
in Plain Strings and Automobiles

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
where he puts his hand in the body.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
He's like, it's not pillow.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
He's like, oh, the football game is pretty good.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
We've made ourselves vulnerable to each other

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
in ways that we don't know what to do with.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
The next time he came out,

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
the next time he was in LA,

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
it happened to be the night that

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Chevy Chase walked off the set

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
of the last episode of the third season.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
We went to this...

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
He saw how upset I was

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
because I got the text message,

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Chevy walked off the set,

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
the tag is ruined, blah, blah, blah.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Went to the rap party

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
and I did that thing that I did.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
That was that night.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
You see, TMZ referred to as me

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
in front of his kids.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
He's not Clark Griswold.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
His kids have television shows.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
His kids are senators.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
They can handle it.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
They're on Lipitor.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
They've got their own problems.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Oh, papa, papa!

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
What did that strange man say to you?

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
They were all on rascals.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
It's not what you think when you hear it.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
It was very funny at the time.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I just remember my dad at that rap party

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
because one guy came up to me

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
and he was like,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
I totally understand this.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
I look back on all of it.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
I'm an asshole,

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
I love my show too much

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
and I'm a fucking petty dick

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
and I have oppositions to find a disorder

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
or whatever, or drunken slur disorder.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
But at the time,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
it was like, look,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
I took that negative behavior,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I turned it into something positive

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
at the rap party, blah, blah, blah.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
One of the crew members

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
who loved Chevy in spite of everything

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
was trying to explain to me

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
in front of my dad

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
who must be a huge Chevy Chase fan.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
My dad's a baby boomer.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
He's like, yeah, but Chevy,

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
he's a personality,

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
he's an asset and all this stuff.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
My dad just unexpectedly

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
sang to this guy like,

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
look, if you run a business,

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
you tell me that

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
if I run a carpet business

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
and your personality means

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
you can't lift carpet,

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
you're fucking fired.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
And then you came in a urinal.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
And then I went and came in a urinal.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
I finally got,

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
either my dad got so zen

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
and realized that he had,

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
or I got so old that

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
we're the same guy.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
He's saying what's about to come out of my mouth.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
This is interesting.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Emily and I

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
are writing a movie together

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
and I just realized right now

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
the movie ends.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
I have this conversation with my dad

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
and it's the conversation of my dreams

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
that I'm never going to have in real life

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
that I wrote in this movie.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
It's kind of, I just realized that.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
I was like, oh my God,

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
it's like the secret.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Oh, fuck you.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
I just realized that.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
I just wrote that conversation

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
so that in some way

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
it'll be real in my head

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
even if it won't be physically real.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Some part of my memory will confuse it

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
and be like, oh yeah, you guys had that talk.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
It always makes me wonder

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
if our generation has kids.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
How's that trickle work?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
It's like, you got my grandpa's

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
who were at Guadalcanal

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
and the other one was at

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
somewhere in the European theater,

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
both of them running around

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
stabbing and shooting

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
and risking their lives.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Both of them come back home,

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
never say a word about it,

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
let alone write, publish a blog about it

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
or a recipe book.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
You have that silent generation,

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
the greatest generation

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
and then the baby boomer generation.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
They're like,

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
I don't know,

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
they weren't exactly quiet

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
but they had a little more class

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
than my generation

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
in terms of talking about their feelings

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
and stuff.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Then I wonder,

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
is this just a slow continuum?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Pretty soon you're just going to have a baby

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
and the baby's crying and you're just crying with it.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
And then you just both cry

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
and you both suck your thumb

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
and just roll around.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
That's how I'm going to do it probably.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
I would say, because Aaron made that tavern

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
in my house upstairs.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
McHarmon's.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
I thought, this is a great nursery

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
because you could put a crib

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
in the middle of it and maybe really realize

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
you could just have bottles of vodka

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
and bottles of milk along the wall

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
and I could just sit in there

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
and we could both just shit our pants

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
and cry

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
and talk about how we hate being told

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
when to go to bed.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
I mean, we talked about this

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
when we were talking about

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
if I'm going to have kids or not,

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
I was like, I don't feel like a grown-up.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I feel like I'm still shitting my pants.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
My dad was always a grown-up to me

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
and it felt like he had the authority

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
to raise a child.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
I don't have the authority to raise a child.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
What I want to talk to this little,

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
like, what's the world like?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
I don't know.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
I've been saving Hyrule my whole life.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
I've saved it like 20 times over.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
That's all I know.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
I don't know anything.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Is everyone just faking it?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Or do people know?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
I think some people don't have to fake it

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
in some areas.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Some people are just really good at

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
putting a car up on blocks

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
and changing the oil and the tires

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
because they get to enjoy it that much

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
because they're not as good

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
at writing a sonnet.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
I don't know.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
It all comes out in the wash.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
I'm not saying that a guy that can fix a car

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
can't write a poem.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
I'm not saying that at all.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
I'm not saying he's dumb just because he's handy.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
I just mean that we all have a bingo card.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
You just have random shit.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
There's a guy out there that's like,

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
I'm good at fixing the car and writing the sonnets,

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
but they've got to be bad at gardening

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
and managing their emotions or something.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
There's something that you do and I do

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
that's like quote-unquote manlier

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
than average.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Just one random category.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
You wouldn't be able to recognize it

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
from across a room.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
There's some specific,

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
maybe it's just the amount of bullying

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
you'll put up with.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
That doesn't feel very manly.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
I know, but take it to an extreme.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Martin Luther King,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
at a certain point you become a real man

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
after putting up with a lot of shit.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
You can change the world by putting up with it.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Anyways,

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
watch this segue.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Check it out.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
I'm so excited.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Sometimes you think,

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm not ready to be a dad.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
I couldn't be a dad because I'm not a grown-up.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I was feeling like that

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
when we watched the X-Files

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
because I was on your X-Files thing.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
I see where you're going.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
I was watching David Duchovny

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
and it's like,

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Fox Mulder was 29 years old

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
in season one of X-Files

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
and I thought, he's a grown-up.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
I'm 41 and he's just still a grown-up to me.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Speaking of X-Files

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
and X-Files podcasts

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
and conspiracy theories,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
there's a new podcast in town.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Camille.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Well done, dad.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
That is also about those things

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
but it's not based on the fictional.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
It's based on the fiction

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
that people

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
either believe in or don't

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
that happens in real life.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
It's called Real Life Sci-Fi.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Did I get that title right?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Yeah.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
And it's by our very old Channel 101 friends,

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
our comrades.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
We're going to come out here

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
to talk about their new podcast.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Willie Roberts and Wade Randolph.

31:27.000 --> 31:32.000
I could have done that better.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
No, that was fucking perfect.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Kind of weak, I think.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
I don't know why.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Well, see, there you go.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
You guys have a Scully-Mulder

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
relationship on the show, right?

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Wade's the skeptic.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
I never seen X-Files.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
That sucks.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
I'm the Smulder.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
The Smulder, yes, the Smulder.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
You know the names.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
You don't know Scully and Mulder?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
No.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
And you're doing a conspiracy theory podcast?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
It's not about your fucking bullshit.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
It's about real stuff.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
They're clapping for me.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
I don't think they are.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
They just want to fight.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
They want the loose change to hit the floor.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
So is it just conspiracy theories?

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Or is it also...

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Well, it's eventually going to be everything

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
that you'll run out of real-life sci-fi.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Like, you know...

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Bigfoot, ghosts, UFOs.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Is the focus always on whether it's real or not?

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Well, yeah, kind of.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Willie's the thing.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
If you talk to anybody who is into conspiracy theories,

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
there's too much information.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
And so, like, in order for it to be yes or no,

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
it's hard because it's like you could just ramble on

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
and a lot of things don't connect.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
So if I were to say,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Hollow Earth, which I've always been fascinated by.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
That's a good one.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Like, Hollow Earth, to me...

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Well, Willie believes everything he reads.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Willie does. Yeah.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
And I don't.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
I give everything I read a chance.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Like, to me, Hollow Earth thing is an interdimensional thing.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Not like a...

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
How do you mean?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Like, if you read about the guy who said he was flying his plane

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
and then he was over North Pole

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
and then there was a hole opening

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
and he went through it.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
It's like Saxon.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Maybe he hit an interdimensional portal

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
that was caused by some magnetic field disruption.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Right.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Is that the story?

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
He was flying over the North Pole.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
And then why did he end up?

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
And he saw a hole and flew into it?

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Yeah, there was one guy who did that.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
You're right.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
If you're a pilot and you see a hole,

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
don't fly into the hole.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
That's what I'm saying.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
You're a terrible pilot.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
How do you turn around?

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
It's like the number one no-no in air travel.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
It's the natural enemy of air travel.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
The ground is cancer in air flight.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Like this particular guy's story,

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
he flew into the middle of the earth

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
and then the beings there landed his plane

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
and then he met them.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
And then the beings in Hollow Earth.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
Because I've read that the Hollow Earth,

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
it starts with just the idea that

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
much like the flat earth people,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
like it just starts with the question,

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
how do we know the earth's not hollow?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
What do you got?

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Pictures of a solid earth.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
And then so some people,

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
branches off into this tree, right?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Where it's like some people think,

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
oh, that's where the Nazis went.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Yeah.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
And then some people go,

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
that's where the aliens are.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
And then some people are like,

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
which I think is amazing.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
It's fun.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
I think it's fun that there are people out there

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
who in the present day are like

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
weaving mythology out of the thing

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
that's really happening.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
My thing is I just like to talk about all that

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
because normally you bring something up

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
and it's like, oh, that was kind of interesting,

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
this shitty article I found on the internet.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
I want to talk to somebody about it

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
and then you just get laughed at

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
and this is like, well,

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
I won't talk to anybody about this.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
But you want to have the fun with it.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
But then other people are like,

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
well, that's dangerous because it was fun

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
to think that you could burn women

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
at the stake in the 1500s.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
It was fun to think leeches were curing people.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
You need to be skeptical to protect people.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Yeah.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
What kind of topics do you guys talk about?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Just say the topics and I'll,

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
I know for sure if they're real or not.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
I actually have the information.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
I'll tell you a yes or no.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Tell me, say it.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Chemtrails?

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
I don't know what that is.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Tell us what chemtrails are.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Chemtrails is like,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
now there's a bunch of different reasons for it

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
or conspiracy theories about it,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
but that there is an additive in jet fuel

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
that is being released over everywhere.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
It's fake.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Making us docile.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Yeah, one of them is to make us docile.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
It's like a mind control thing.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Okay, that's not true.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
That one's lies.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
No, Camille's right.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
What's the next one?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
One of those is like,

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
well, they're trying to block out some of the sun

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
to protect us from overheating.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Why would they not tell us

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
if that's what they're doing?

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Because everyone would say no.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Everyone would say no,

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
but that's the key.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Well, here's the thing.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
I know it's not working

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
because we can see the fucking sun.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
It's out there every day.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
If you look at history, though,

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
the government has done tests

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
on people without their permission

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
forever.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Oh, yeah, no.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
That's the cool thing about conspiracy theories

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
is it's an interesting line

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
between like there are some people

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
who talk in fantastical terms

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
and have a flexible grip on logic

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
that will abuse it.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
So the scientific mind says,

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
well, we have to protect the underlings

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
from this kind of stuff.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
You have to be skeptical

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
and use scientific method.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
But, however, the healthy thing

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
about paranoia is that you should

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
never trust the government.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
And it always turns out every 30 years

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
that they were doing fucked up shit

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
30 years ago.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Well, even though I do hate the word

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
the government because, like,

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
even within our government,

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
there's 20s that don't work, right?

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
What an asshole.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Yeah, I know.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Me and Adam said it together

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
and I immediately knew I was on the wrong side.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
I'm sorry, Willie.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Ghosts?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Ghosts? Not real.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Fake.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
What about ghost ads?

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Take it easy, Adam.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Oh.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Fluorinating the water.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
What do you guys think of ghosts?

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
What's your take on it?

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
We haven't covered it yet.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
I could be convinced, maybe.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
You could be convinced.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Yeah.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Dad, what do you think?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
I don't think that dead people

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
keep being people.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
It doesn't make sense.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Yeah.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
And I feel like light bounces off

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
solid things.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
But if Jeff Davis was here,

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
he could tell you, like, four ghost stories.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Yeah, yeah, he has a lot of ghost stories.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
And then they're great.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
But I do believe,

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
or I should say I am willing to believe,

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
definitely, because to me skepticism

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
loses its value at the point

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
where it starts to become dogmatic.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Where you start to assume that the things

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
you don't know, you know everything about.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
So I do believe that it's perfectly

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
possible that there is, like,

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
that we're, because we're evolved from apes

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
that are only biological purposes

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
to recognize a good banana from a bad one.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
And we've graduated into this world

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
where we're starting to understand things.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
It's totally possible that there's a lot more

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
ways to perceive things than we actually...

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
You kind of bring up a good point, though,

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
because there's no ape ghosts.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Nobody ever...

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Nobody ever has.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
There was an X-Files about animal ghosts, wasn't there?

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Fuck, yes.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
And I watched this show. Great episode.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Like, you don't find, like,

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
you think that there'd be, like,

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Native American ghosts in the free country,

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
or in the open land.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
But they never, Native Americans,

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
I don't want to be racist,

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
but they never die with unfinished business.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
They use the whole life.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
I can explain that.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
They're famous for it.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
It's not racism if it's a good stereotype.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
No, it's good.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
It's totally good.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I just riffed that, isn't it awesome?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
No, I'm a really good racist.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
You're, like, a genius.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
It was really good.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
It felt like you'd written that at home.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
It was a real good racist.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
It was really good.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
It was a good quick defense.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
So...

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Yeah, go ahead.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
No, I just connect dots with racist stereotypes.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
No, I could take credit for it all night.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Let's go on.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
For you, Dan,

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
for you to be open to the idea of ghosts,

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
doesn't that...

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
don't you have to change pretty fundamental things

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
about how you see the world?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Well, no, because I don't automatically assume

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
that when we talk about ghosts,

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
what I think of when I think about ghosts

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
is I think about when you're in your apartment

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
brushing your teeth and you turn and you go,

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
well, fuck!

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
There's a fucking dude with a ten-speed bike

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
over his shoulder,

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
walking through my living room.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
That could be explained by a lot of things

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
that don't have to do with there being a heaven

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
or people dying and their skin falling away

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
and then I'm just like, I love ten-speeds

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
and I'm going to go spread the word

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
because I got to solve my murder.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
It doesn't...

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
It could be like a psychic smudge.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
It could be that that person...

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Like residual energy or something?

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
That person fell in love with a woman

41:20.000 --> 41:25.000
and every morning when he hoisted his ten-speed

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
over his shoulder to go to work in that apartment,

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
his heart became filled with this emotional energy

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
that over time the way a key on your keyboard

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
can become melted.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
If you work in a data entry lab,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
like the home row is melted from friction

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
of hitting the same button over the same amount of time.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
And it's just brought out by you brushing your teeth?

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Like no, it's just another...

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
It's human perception.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
I don't know.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
This is assuming that there's some fields

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
that we haven't discovered yet

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
that we can perceive.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
One of them is light bouncing into our retina

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
and then maybe some of it is like somehow

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
this would get into psychic energy

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
that this guy had this experience.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
He would eat a nut bar

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
and he'd throw his bike over his shoulder

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
and it was like somehow for him it was like a big deal.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
It was like he did it over and over again

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
or he did it one day and it was like he achieved

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
self-actualization at that moment

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
or he was really angry or whatever.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
But there's like some weird fingerprint on the film

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
and then you turn and you're brushing your teeth

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
and you see that guy's feelings.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
You see his self-image.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
He left it there in your apartment.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
Yeah, some kind of like residual energy echo

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
that we'll just never know about or...

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
I don't know.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
I'm open to most things.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
But I don't think I would ever wake up

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
when there would be a guy sitting on my bed

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
going like hey, I'm Napoleon.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
I buried my hat at McDonald's.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Then he goes...

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
I have unfinished business.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
Wait, do we have to take over Russia now?

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
All these cabinets should be open.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
All these cabinets should be open.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
I just got to find my hat.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
It's under the McDonald's. Go find it.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
You could make a lot of money on that hat.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
You know, when you get into...

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
I just started...

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Time, okay.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Time, fellas.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
It's symmetrical.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
We're experiencing it one moment after another

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
but there's all this...

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
I need a couple more degrees

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
and a few more IQ points before

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
I could really understand this or explain it

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
but smart people will tell you

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
that time unfolds in all directions.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Is that what you're hearing?

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Anything you can describe that happens in time.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
First of all, time is a variable and blah, blah, blah.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
When your cabinet doors are open,

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
they've all come open overnight,

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
maybe some lady that lived in your apartment

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
opened them in 1938.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
And somehow time got shuffled.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
But yeah, I just don't believe in hopeful ghosts

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
like talking to you and going like,

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
hey, I'm dead.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
And they're like, you're dead. Get out of here.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
And he's like, I'm sorry, I'm so dead.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
For some reason I draw the line at just dialogue.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
It just starts to get corny.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
No, that's a huge leap from just a smudge on the film

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
to unfinished business.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
That's a big leap.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
I get it. I agree.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
To me, unfinished business is so, it can be so,

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
like the unfinished business you have right now

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
and you're all alive is like,

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
can be so beautiful and stupid.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Sounds like a romantic comedy that we're writing.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Unfinished business.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I just remembered something really funny.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I did this media conference in beautiful,

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
in the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Canada

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
where there was, it was taking this hotel

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
that was absolutely shining,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
like all the good parts of the shining,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
like all the beautiful parts, none of the dead

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Scatman crothers or anything.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
And I kept saying, oh yeah, this place is,

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
this place is definitely haunted.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
If any place is haunted, is that,

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
is that the air coming out of the show?

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
I think it's a smudge on the film.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
There was a woman who used to dry her hair here

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
30 years ago.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
And I was out on a patio at a party with Erin

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
and it was like, oh yeah, that place is probably haunted

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
and this guy was like, oh yeah,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
have you seen Toby?

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Or like some guy's name.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Or like, who's Toby?

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
He's like, oh, the Bellman, yeah.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
Yeah, he definitely, people see him there

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
at the hotel.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Like, oh yeah, what does he do?

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
He's like, oh, you know, he's the Bellman.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
He just, he'll take your luggage.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
And I was like, I don't know, so funny.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Do you have a Canadian ghost?

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Have you ever lost a back?

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Because that's Toby.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Canadian ghost, his unfinished business is just his job.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
It's just people.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
He's never experienced love.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
Geez, you know what, I forgot to thank Mr. Henderson

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
in 314.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
I should really tell him a good job.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Very sad.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
That's very sad.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
I love the idea of a ghost.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
He's just like, oh God, I still have to do

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
the terrible job I had.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
We were falling over ourselves because

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
I'm sure the guy walked away like, he's

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
a ghost, but like, I was like, does he say boo?

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
How does he pronounce?

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
My big question is, how does a Canadian ghost

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
pronounce boo?

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
All right.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
What are you doing?

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
There were a couple of false starts on that joke

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
or I'm going to really kill him.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
All right, so boo.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
You don't belong here.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
That's good, that's something.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
But I was in the first episode of your podcast

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
and we talked about UFOs.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Yeah, whether they're real or not.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
We were focusing more on the moon landing being faked.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
Oh yeah, the moon landing being faked, right.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
Because the moon, according to you, is a metal base.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
A metal base?

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Well, when things hit it, it sounds like a bell

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
and none of the craters are deeper than the others

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
or something.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
When things hit it, it sounds like a bell?

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
They blew up, they put a bomb on the moon

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
and they said it.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Some people claim that it rang like a bell.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
When did they put a bomb on the moon?

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
I didn't get to vote for this.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
There's so much to buy into this story.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
So many barriers.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
I don't care what you believe about the moon,

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
it's weird that we bomb the moon

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
and most people don't know about it.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
What?

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
When did we...

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
We were looking for water.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Yeah, but we didn't tell anybody we were looking

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
for water just in this bomb up to the moon.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Was it a nuke?

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
No, no, it was just a bomb.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
Just like a regular bomb.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
It was just like a bundle of TNT with an alarm clock on it.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
With a NASA logo.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
There's that whole thing about us being warring off the moon.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
Conspiracy theorists love that,

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
the idea that we haven't actually done a moon mission

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
since forever.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
And the idea is that we got there

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
and then an alien said, get out of here.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
You get out of my moon.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
You damn kids.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
You got the big one right there.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Yeah, yours is bigger than ours.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Let me have this one.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
There are just like eight of us here

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
and we got the moon, you guys got the big one.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
But what are the conspiracy theories about the moon?

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
You said that the other side of the moon,

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
the dark side of the moon has like a base on it.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Well, I mean, here's the thing.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Oh, that's right.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
That's right.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
But like, okay.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
I'll give them this real quick.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
I've been looking for UFOs my whole life

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
and I've never seen them.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
And then one year I saw like 30 all at once.

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
And I called someone from across town.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
Like a fleet of them?

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Yeah.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
I like that there's more to this story

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
that has nothing to do with you having seen 30 UFOs.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
How did you see 30 UFOs?

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Explain that part.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I mean, you know, I like to look at the sky.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
I'm fascinated by planes.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
They're just silver things in the sky.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying they're aliens.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
You're just saying that I'm an identified plane object.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
30 of them.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
And they look like stars in the middle of the day.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
It's like they're hard to focus on.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
You look at the blue sky and you got like eye boogers

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
and weird like eye snakes and you can't focus.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
You don't know what your focal length is.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
And then so like I'll see one.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
I'll look away and I'll be hard to find,

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
but I'll always be with people.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
I'm like, hey, look at that.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
What do you think it is?

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
And we'll look at it for like a half hour

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
and it doesn't do anything that I recognize, you know.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
And I saw 30 one day.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
And this is the first time I saw it.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
I thought an alien invasion was happening.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
I took pictures.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
I took video.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
I was drawing like some of them were moving

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
and some of them weren't.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
I watched the skies for the rest of the day.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
They had changed the flight patterns

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
for Burbank and LAX.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
But that's just bullshit.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
You don't know that you should look up.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Online the flight patterns.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
No, no, I look at the flight patterns all the time.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
Like when the wind changes.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
You just watch the skies and you go, oh, there's no planes.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
But you can see where they were they redirected to.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Wait, wait, there was one day of your life

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
where you said that an alien invasion was imminent.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
Yeah.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
We already know each other then?

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Just fucking text me.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Well, here's the thing.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
If you think an alien invasion,

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
I want to be on the list of people

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
and like, hey, shit's going down.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Come on, get on the ground.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
I was sitting there going like,

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
is this hot?

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
Just fucking text me, dude.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
I'll be the one to judge.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
You're going to get a text every other day.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
You're going to get a lot of text.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
Especially 30 a day.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Okay, here's the thing.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I drew out a map of the ones that were stationary

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
and the ones that were moving.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
To me, it was like, oh, this looks like a constellation.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Could other people see him too?

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
I've been with at least 30 people.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
I've been like, what's that?

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
It's 30, just the number.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
It's only 30.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Is that the highest you can count?

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
I could say 10 names right now off the top of my head.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
You were with?

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Yeah.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
Obama, Margaret Thatcher.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
I've been with groups of people.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
And people have seen these things.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
I mean, I've seen them.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
But not in Armada.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
I've seen one or two.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
And they're just silver things.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
But here's my things.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
Okay, I saw these things and then I started telling people

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
because to me it was like, this is kind of fucking weird.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
I should tell everyone I know.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
Didn't tell me.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
I guess I'm not one of the people.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
I even told Wade at the first party I went to.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
I don't know if you remember,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
I kind of laughed it off and like nobody was listening to me.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
And I was like, this is weird because I saw something that to me,

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
I'm not saying they're aliens.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
I'm just saying this was life changing to me

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
because there were things in the sky that I didn't know what they were.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
And it made me think and everyone was basically laughing

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
or not believing it.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
And made me go like, everybody that has a weird story

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
that people laugh at like,

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
I want to listen to their story a little more.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Every movie, every sci-fi movie,

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
your character is the good guy.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
But in life, you're the crazy guy.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
Your only record is the right sci-fi movies.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
Do you guys have people on the show that are like experts,

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
like ufologists?

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Not yet. I want to get there though.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
They had me on.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Like you believe in the UFOs?

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
I was like, it's possible.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
And he's seen all the X files.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Well, I would talk to you guys all night,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
but my sluggishness means we got a train scheduled to keep.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
It's real life sci-fi. It's on Farrell Audio.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
I think it launches Monday.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
It's going to be on Farrell Audio on Monday.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Which is today, I guess, for all of us on purpose.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
Yeah, it'll be today when most people hear about it.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
This is a crazy audience, by the way,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
because they're willing to not watch the Game of Thrones finale.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Most of them are watching on the East Coast feed.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
Oh, you've already seen it?

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
Okay, don't tell me.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
How was that?

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
They do.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
They're very...

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
We have a relationship here.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
These guys are good people.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I understand the NBA finals.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
You guys can miss that.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
But Game of Thrones, shit.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
All right, well, thank you Wade Randolph,

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Willie Roberts, for coming by.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
Thanks for having us on.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Real life sci-fi.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Hey, just put it down.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
All right, so we've got to keep the train speeding,

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
speeding along.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
I've fucked up real bad.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
I've made our show real long.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
Is it going too long?

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
No, I just mean, there's so much to do.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's so much to do.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
There's one other thing to do.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Let's go on to the next segment.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Erin McGathy, will you come out, please?

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
This is my fiancée.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Hi, everybody.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
Hi.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
So I'm here for a special reason.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Yes.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
The Harmontown documentary is premiering

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
tomorrow night.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
And we actually have two tickets

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
to the Harmontown documentary.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
And Dan was like,

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
how should we give these away?

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
And I begged to do a McGathey game corner.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
Yeah!

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
And he said no.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
No, no, he said yes.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
So is there, is there anybody here

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
who does not have tickets tomorrow

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
and really wants to go?

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
All right, we got two hands here.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Come on up, sir.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
What's your name?

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
Daniel.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Great.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
And then hands again.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
We should do a lady one.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
We should do a lady one, right?

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Someone who would actually go.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Okay, all right, you got a waving hand.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
I'm sorry, you have a very sweet face.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Here, come on.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
All right, hello.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
I already forgot your name.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
What was your name again?

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
Daniel.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
What was your name?

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Bethany.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Bethany.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
Fantastic.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
And Camille, I'm going to...

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Do they need microphones?

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
Could they have an extra one here?

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
They do.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
They do.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Let's make sure.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
Is there another one?

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
Perfect.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
I can sit.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
Do they need another one?

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
Because I can sit on it.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
Okay.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
Oh, we're good, we're all set.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
Here.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
Great.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
And I'm going to give you both these cards

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
that say Daniel's name.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
What are the names?

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Bethany and what now?

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
Dan.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
Dan.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
How's that spelled?

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
All right, Bethany and Dan.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
B-A-N.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Here are your materials.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Thank you.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
All right, I haven't discussed this game

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
with anybody else.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
It's only just been in my head, so we'll see.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Should I be looking at any of this?

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Or should I?

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
You can.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
All right, so we are going to play a game

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
called...

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Harmonized Impressions.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
She's got it.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
That's a theme song.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
Harmonized Impressions, everybody.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Welcome.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Welcome to Harmonized Impressions.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Now, there are a lot of things that I love.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
I love ice cream.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
I love communing with nature.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
But one of the theme songs is still going on behind me.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
But one of the things I love more than anything

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
are Dan Harmon's Impressions.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
What we're going to do is Dan has a book

56:51.000 --> 56:57.000
of Bartlett's quotes in front of him.

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
And there are different categories.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
We're going to go back and forth.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
And I'm going to give you, Bethany and Dan,

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
I'm going to give you the choice of two different categories.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
When it's your turn, you get to pick the category.

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
Dan is going to read a quote from Bartlett's quote book

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
in the impression that I've already listed for him

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
on a piece of paper.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
And then you will have a choice of three different names

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
to choose who he is doing an impression of.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
Yeah.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
And to decide who goes first,

57:34.000 --> 57:39.000
we're going to have you both do your best Dan impression.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
And I'm just going to decide really quick.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
All right.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Bethany?

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
Here we go.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
All right.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
Great.

57:51.000 --> 57:59.000
Okay.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
All right.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
Bethany.

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
And you're holding cards that say,

58:06.000 --> 58:04.000
Comele,

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
during the game,

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
if you,

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
if Dan does his impression and you were totally stumped,

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
you can use your Comele card

58:15.000 --> 58:17.280
And then Camille will do the same impression.

58:17.280 --> 58:22.080
Okay, so yeah, I'll read it, you'll give me a...

58:22.080 --> 58:24.120
You'll get the code and everything

58:24.120 --> 58:25.840
and you will do your best impression.

58:25.840 --> 58:27.320
I'm terrible at impressions.

58:27.320 --> 58:29.400
They all sound like a Pakistani guy

58:29.400 --> 58:32.320
pretending to be something else.

58:32.320 --> 58:33.560
So we ring in...

58:33.560 --> 58:35.160
You don't ring in, so you're gonna go first,

58:35.160 --> 58:36.800
so this is your turn.

58:36.800 --> 58:38.160
Bethany, go for it.

58:38.160 --> 58:41.560
Yeah, and your two categories that you get to choose from

58:41.560 --> 58:46.880
are Captain's Log or I'm a Bitch, I'm a Lover.

58:46.880 --> 58:48.800
I'm a bitch.

58:48.800 --> 58:50.880
I'm gonna go with I'm a Bitch, I'm a Lover.

58:50.880 --> 58:53.120
Excellent, so these are three women

58:53.120 --> 58:56.040
who are known for performing at Lilith Fair.

58:56.040 --> 58:59.880
Okay, all right, I get it.

58:59.880 --> 59:01.600
So, and I just read a quote.

59:01.600 --> 59:04.360
Yeah, read any quote, you see the name in front of you

59:04.360 --> 59:06.600
and I wait for me to give you the multiple choice

59:06.600 --> 59:07.560
after he reads it.

59:07.560 --> 59:08.400
Okay, multiple choice.

59:08.400 --> 59:11.520
Here we go, I'm a Bitch, I'm a Lover.

59:11.520 --> 59:15.040
All this will not be finished

59:15.040 --> 59:18.760
in the first 100 days.

59:18.760 --> 59:23.280
Now it will be finished in the first 1,000 days.

59:23.280 --> 59:24.280
I know who it is.

59:24.280 --> 59:29.640
Not in the life of the Seministration

59:29.640 --> 59:33.240
nor even perhaps

59:33.240 --> 59:36.880
in a lifetime on this planet.

59:36.880 --> 59:39.680
But let us begin.

59:39.680 --> 59:40.680
All right, great, so is that...

59:40.680 --> 59:41.680
That's fucking...

59:41.680 --> 59:42.680
Okay.

59:42.680 --> 59:43.680
Is that...

59:43.680 --> 59:47.400
Is the answer being an impression of A, Tori Amos,

59:47.400 --> 59:53.680
B, Lisa Loeb, C, Sarah McLaughlin.

59:53.680 --> 59:55.280
Can I get the choices again?

59:55.280 --> 01:00:01.240
A, Tori Amos, B, Lisa Loeb, C, Sarah McLaughlin.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.240
Audience answers showing A.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.320
I'm gonna go with A.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.120
That is correct.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.000
A, A, A, A, A, A, A.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Dan, that was pretty fucking great.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Thanks.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Great.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
So Bethany has one point.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Bethany has one point.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Now it's Dan's turn.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And I forgot to mention

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
that if you get it wrong,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
you'll get the chicken.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
All right, here we go.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.920
Dan, you can choose from these categories

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.760
Captain's Log or Bloody Funny.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.760
Let's go with Captain's Log.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:33.760
Captain's Log.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.200
All right, these are three characters

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.200
from Star Trek, First Generation.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:47.200
Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:55.200
All right, is that A, check off, B, Sulu, C, Spock.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.200
Is it C?

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.200
C is Spock.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.200
No!

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.200
It's Sulu, right?

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.200
It is Sulu.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.200
He got the chicken.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.200
I just wanted the chicken, sorry.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.200
All right, Bethany, you can choose

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.200
from Bloody Funny or Vogue.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.200
I'm going to do Bloody Funny.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.200
Bloody Funny.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.200
All right, these are well-known,

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.200
this is a well-known British comedian.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:22.200
I don't even, I mean...

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:33.200
Men do not care how nobly they live.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.200
But only how long?

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.200
Although it is within the reach

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.200
of every man they have nobly,

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:43.200
but within no man's power to live long.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.200
All right.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:49.200
All right, so is that A, Ricky Gervais.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.200
B, Russell Brand.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.200
C, Eddie Isard.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.200
Oh, it's either A or C.

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:02.200
I'm going to go with C.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.200
No!

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.200
Can I guess?

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.200
B.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.200
Yeah, it was Russell Brand.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.200
A lot of this is chance,

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.200
because you're picking between the two.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.200
All right, Dan.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.200
I'm scanning down this list of people now.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.200
All right, Dan.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.200
Vogue or Rocket Men?

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.200
Rocket Men.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.200
Rocket Men.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.200
All right, this is the host

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.200
of a science-related show.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.200
Jesus.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.200
Walk not on the earth exultantly.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.200
For thou canst not cleave the earth.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.200
Neither shalt thou reach to the mountains in height.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.200
Great.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.200
So is that...

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.200
I didn't mean to sound so dry.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.200
Is that A, Adam Savage.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.200
B, Bill Nye.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.200
Or C, Neil deGrasse Tyson.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.200
Oh!

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.200
Dan has just pulled his Camille card.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.200
He has just pulled his gift Camille card.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.200
I'm terrible at impressions.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.200
Thank you.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.200
So Camille is going to read this exact same quote.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.200
Oh.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.200
It's the one from the Quran.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.200
Walk not on earth.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.200
So no excuses.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.200
All right, here we go.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.200
I honestly don't know what this person sounds like.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.200
I'm just going to do an impression of Dan.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.200
Doing an impression of this person.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.200
Fuck.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.200
Weirdly, this is going to be the first ever recording of me

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:57.200
reading anything from the Quran.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.200
Who could have predicted this?

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.200
Walk not on the earth.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.200
Exultantly.

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:07.200
For thou canst not cleave the earth.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:13.200
Neither shalt thou reach to the mountains in height.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.200
That's me doing an impression.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.200
Definitely not of the other people.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.200
Just so they know who it isn't.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.200
All right.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.200
What do you think, Dan?

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.200
Let's go Neil deGrasse.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.200
That is correct.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.200
Well done.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.200
Nice.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.200
All right.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.200
Bethany, vogue or drink the Kool-Aid?

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.200
These are your categories.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.200
Vogue or drink the Kool-Aid?

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.200
Vogue.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.200
All right.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.200
These are famous supermodels.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.200
So Dan is going to do an impression of a supermodel.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.200
A specific one.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.200
I don't know what this sounds like either.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:01.200
One of the things which distinguishes ours from all earlier generations is this.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.200
That we have seen our atoms.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.200
I've never heard this person talk.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.200
That's right.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.200
Some of the categories.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.200
Can I see that?

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.200
Yeah.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:18.200
So is that A, Cindy Crawford, B, Brooke Shields, or C, Amon?

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.200
Let's go with C.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.200
C.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.200
A.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200
That is correct.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.200
She can hear my mole.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.200
A lot of people in the audience are yelling out C, so maybe you do a good Amon.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.200
Do you guys never see House of Style?

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.200
She talked...

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.200
Do you guys know House of Style?

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.200
She talked on that all the time.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.200
I never watched House of Style.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.200
Camille, what's the score?

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.200
Bethany 2, Dan 0.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.200
But Bethany did go...

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.200
I mean, Dan 1.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.200
But Bethany did go first, so...

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.200
Right, exactly.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.200
All right.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.200
Dan, drink the Kool-Aid or free entertainment?

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.200
Free entertainment.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200
All right.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:14.200
Here, this is a podcast host.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:19.200
One of the things which distinguishes ours from all earlier generations is this, that

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.200
we have seen our atoms.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:29.200
Is that A, Paul F. Tompkins, B, Marc Maron, C, Ira Glass.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.200
Can I see the list?

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.200
I wanted to say A.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200
I'll go with A.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.200
That is correct!

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:43.200
Although I would love to see Dan's Ira Glass.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.200
Do it.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:50.200
We're back with Public Radio.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:57.200
One of the things I found most interesting, since you left us, is the story about Jacob.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.200
Not Jacob.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.200
Who lost his leg.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.200
Yeah.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:07.200
Jacob lost his leg in a cup of water.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.200
What does that do to a person?

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.200
How many legs do you need?

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:17.200
We'll be right back.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.200
So that was Dan.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.200
You guessed that right.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.200
That was Dan.

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.200
So it's tied, 2-2.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.200
All right.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:29.200
Bethany, drink the Kool-Aid or wicked packing?

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:32.200
I'll go wicked packing.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.200
All right.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:41.200
This is an actor from Boston.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:45.200
There is only one proof method of assisting the advancement of pure science.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:54.200
That of picking men of genius, backing them heavily, and leaving them to direct themselves.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:08:06.200
All right, was that A, Ben Affleck, B, Donald Loog, C, Mark Wahlberg?

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.200
I might want to do that.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.200
How many rounds are left?

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:12.200
Just three-fourths.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.200
Three-fourths.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.200
Well, as far as rounds go.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.200
So I guess technically two.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.200
I don't know.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.200
I'm not good with numbers.

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.200
Okay, so it was Ben Affleck and Mark Wahlberg, Donald Loog.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:27.200
I'm going to go with Donald Loog.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.200
No!

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:35.200
That was Mark Wahlberg.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.200
Hey, little dog.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.200
It's a contextual impression.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.200
You have to be talking to an animal.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.200
You have to change the words.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.200
Hey, buddy.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.200
Hey, buddy.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.200
I'm Mark Wahlberg.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.200
All right, Dan.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:59.200
Your categories to choose from are Drink the Kool-Aid or La La Royalty.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.200
Let's go drink the Kool-Aid.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.200
All right.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:09.200
This is a famous cult leader.

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:14.200
You gain strength, courage, confidence by every experience in which you really stop

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:17.200
to look for fear in the face.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.200
You're able to say to yourself, I live through this home.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.200
I can take this next thing that comes along.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:30.200
You must do the thing that you think you cannot do.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:39.200
So was that A, Charles Manson, B, Jim Jones, C, David Koresh?

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.200
Let's go with the first one.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.200
That is correct.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.200
Dan pulls ahead, three to two.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:53.200
That was Bob Odenkirk's impression of Charles Manson from the 1992 Ben Stiller sketch,

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.200
which you should Google, watch online.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.200
It's called Manson.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.200
It's a lassy thing.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.200
It's very funny.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:08.200
Bethany, your choice is between La La Royalty and Come Together.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.200
I'm going to do Come Together.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.200
All right.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:19.200
So this is a beetle.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.200
Death and taxes and childbirth.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:29.200
There's never any convenient time for any of them.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:33.200
Also, that's just a beetle.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.200
You averaged all the beetles.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.200
That's your impression of all of them.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:46.200
Manson has to fill the time available for its completion.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:53.200
So is that A, John Lennon, B, Ringo Starr, C, Paul McCartney, D, George Harrison?

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.200
D, all of you both.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:01.200
Ringo.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.200
Paul.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:08.200
That is correct.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:12.200
Always was the distinct one.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200
All right.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.200
Dan, La La Royalty or House of Incest.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.200
Oh, is that a camera thrones thing?

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.200
Let's go House of Incest.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.200
All right.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:30.200
This is a Lannister.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.200
Peace is not an absence of war.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:46.200
It is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.200
Oh, shit.

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:55.200
Was that A, Jamie Lannister, B, Tyrion Lannister, C, Joffrey Lannister.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.200
That is correct.

01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.200
All right.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.200
Final round.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.200
Final round.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.200
Bethany, you've got to get this to stay alive.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.200
You have to get this right.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.200
And I recommend you use your mail.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.200
Because it's three to four right now.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.200
Oh, okay.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.200
Oh, and this is worth two points.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.200
Okay.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.200
All right.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.200
So you're tied.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.200
Oh, no, no, no.

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.200
Oh, it's three to four.

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.200
No, if she gets it, if it's one or two.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.200
If it's two, then whoever gets this right wins.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.200
Okay.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.200
Unless she gets it wrong, then I'm fine.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.200
Yeah.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.200
All right.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.200
I'm going to stick with my dumb suggestion.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.200
That's two points.

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.200
All right.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:45.200
So you get to choose between La Royalty or Good Day Ladies.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.200
Good Day Ladies.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.200
All right.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.200
This is an Australian actress.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.200
Oh, boy.

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.200
It's an Australian actress.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.200
Take it away, Dan.

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.200
How much time he...

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:09.200
Irish actress?

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.200
How much time he gains who does not look to see

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.200
what the neighbor says or does...

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.200
I want to...

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.200
It's bloody terrible.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.200
Yes, it's bloody terrible.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.200
You should have seen the other option.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.200
I'm going to take a shorter quote.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:33.200
You betcha three hours too soon that a minute's too late.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.200
Thank you.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.200
All right.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.200
What's that?

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.200
A. Nicole Kidman.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.200
B. Kate Blanchett.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.200
Or C. Tony Collette.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.200
I see you reaching at your Camille card.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.200
I'm going to use my...

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.200
All right.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.200
Camille card.

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.200
Okay.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.200
It's this Shakespeare one.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.200
Better three hours too soon.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.200
That's a short quote.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.200
Okay.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.200
All right.

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.200
I have to...

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.200
Okay.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.200
I'm going to make really dumb eyes for this one.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:16.200
I have to make my eyes really empty.

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.200
Better three hours too soon

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.200
than a minute too late.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.200
Okay.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:31.200
All right, all right.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.200
I think that actually helped.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:37.200
So is that Nicole Kidman, Kate Blanchett, or Tony Collette?

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.200
I'm going to go with Nicole Kidman.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:44.200
That is correct.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.200
Who does not speak with an Australian accent?

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.200
It feels like she's from everywhere and nowhere.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.200
It feels like the ocean birthed her.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.200
She comes out for awards shows

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.200
and she's got the glasses with the gown

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.200
and she speaks like an English person.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.200
It's like a faint accent.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.200
Everyone has an accent.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:10.200
All right, so this is the final question.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.200
He made an expression after he said

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:17.200
that the caption was nailed it.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.200
Hashtag.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.200
All right, this is the final question.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.200
Wait, I thought that was the final one.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.200
Well, I really want Dan to do this one.

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:29.200
All right, so this is just a pride question.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.200
You've got to get it right to when.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.200
So this is the category La La Royalty, which is famous.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.200
You know that I don't know who this person is.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.200
You don't know who that is?

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.200
No, I don't know who this person is.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.200
It looks like it's just an expression.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:49.200
What? Can you tell me who it is?

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.200
She can talk.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:56.200
Can I see him?

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.200
It's more about the other two being...

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:02.200
Just try it. Just try it.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.200
Just try it.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.200
Okay, great.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.200
Just make a guess.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.200
Really good.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.200
Here we go.

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:12.200
Wait, what is this category?

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:18.200
This is our famous daughter's La La Royalty of Hollywood.

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:26.200
Nothing but truth is lovely.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:29.200
Nothing fair.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:32.200
By the way, if there was a little girl that sounded like that,

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.200
take her to the doctor or take her in the jungle.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.200
We'd be put in a bag and thrown in a river.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.200
Yeah, throw that in the river.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:44.200
Yeah, is that a tremor talking?

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.200
What is that?

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.200
I'm not the criminal here.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.200
Like, look at this list of names she wrote down for me to do.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.200
There's not a Vincent Price on here.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.200
I only do three impressions.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.200
Where's Liam Neeson?

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:05.200
Ask, ask Vincent Price, tell her that you want to do an impression of Liam Neeson.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:11.200
How come you didn't let Dan do the right impressions?

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:16.200
Alright, who was the goddamn person I did?

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:20.200
Alright, was that A, Suri Cruz?

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.200
B, Willow Smith?

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:28.200
Or C, Miley Cyrus?

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.200
What was the first one?

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.200
Suri Cruz.

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:36.200
I gotta say one of those three people's parents is way less of a megastar.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:42.200
Like Suri Cruz is Tom Cruz and Nicole Kidman and Kate, whatever, Katie Holmes.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.200
Kate, just Kate.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:49.200
Tom Cruz achieved a feet in level so high he can reproduce with Kate.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:54.200
That's level 32, plus $780,000.

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:58.200
You achieved the ability to reproduce with Kate.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:04.200
Willow Smith is Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith and then Miley Cyrus is Billy Ray Cyrus

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.200
who we didn't really know until Miley Cyrus showed up.

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.200
That's why he's always such a permissive parent in those interviews.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.200
He's like, yeah, fuck it, I don't care.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.200
Well, did you see some of her titties?

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.200
Good, good on her.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:23.200
All the way to the bank.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.200
Some of her titties.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.200
So Dan, who do you think it is?

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.200
I'll just say Suri Cruz.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.200
Oh, Dan Wynne.

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.200
Well, congratulations.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.200
Wait, who won?

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.200
Dan won.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.200
Oh, he did?

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:45.200
He was behind and then he had a big comeback.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:52.200
But I normally think this is lame when people do this, but I want to give you guys both tickets.

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:57.200
Not that I think it's lame when people give people things, but I mean.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.200
They both get a pair of tickets, right?

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.200
Yeah, they both get a pair of tickets.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.200
Oh my god.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.200
Here for W and Dan.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:10.200
Thank you.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.200
I could have made that shorter.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.200
Did we miss anybody on there?

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.200
I mean, Sulu, I could do.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.200
Sulu was great, your Sulu was great, Dan.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:24.200
Well, if I was to ever do this again, I would mix it in with some ringers.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.200
There'd be more ringers.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.200
I was trying to challenge you.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:30.200
I thought maybe you'd discover a new impression that you do.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.200
Yeah, I thought my Paul F. Tompkins was kind of okay.

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.200
Yeah.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:40.200
He has a jovial quality to it when he does interviews.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:42.200
It's not like the way he talks actually at all.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.200
Paul, what's your favorite afternoon snack?

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.200
I love Skittles.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.200
Do you just eat them alone?

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:56.200
I eat it with a celebrity interview on Speak Easy.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:00.200
It's a YouTube interview show that I was on.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.200
You can see my episode coming up soon.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.200
Should we bring Spencer out?

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:12.200
Yes, bring Spencer out.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:15.200
Kumail, that was some hot-com controlling right there.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.200
Yeah, what the fuck, right?

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.200
I almost just got murdered.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:22.200
This guy stepped on his foot, not his fault,

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:26.200
over there, put their leg out to trip me like right as I was coming up.

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.200
Let's burn him.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:29.200
Did you do it on purpose?

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.200
My leg was out. I didn't know he was coming.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.200
It's prom, guy.

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.200
Did you go to prom?

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.200
I didn't go to prom.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.200
You did it?

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.200
No, I did.

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.200
What's prom?

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.200
Where's the lady that you was here?

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.200
She's not here.

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.200
I didn't end up going.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.200
You know who is here?

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.200
Spencer!

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:50.200
You know, that guy almost fucking killed me.

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.200
You're giving him a whole thing.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.200
He's the new Spencer.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.200
That's how we...

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.200
I can tell.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:57.200
I can tell.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.200
It's like Minuto.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:01.200
No, I mean, you're fine, probably,

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.200
unless you actually were trying to kill me.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.200
No, he didn't go to prom with her, he said.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.200
So, I mean, he's vengeance.

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.200
Why is he prom, guy?

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.200
How do we know so much about this guy?

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.200
He was the guy that was with the girl and he asked her to do the prom

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.200
and she was really awkward about it.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.200
That very awkward thing that I did where I was like,

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.200
I know something, can I?

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.200
When you were really high.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.200
I was...

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.200
Yeah, I must have been.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.200
I don't remember any of this.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.200
This was after the Renaissance Fair.

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:24.200
Oh, Renaissance Fair, yeah.

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.200
That's a blackout, yeah.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.200
Yeah, I haven't listened to that one.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.200
That was...

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.200
That was gone.

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.200
Spencer, did you...

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.200
Did you...

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:33.200
Did you have a nice day?

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:34.200
Oh, that's right.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:35.200
What?

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.200
Oh, is that sorry?

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.200
Oh, yeah, that was the cult day.

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.200
Yes, day great.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.200
Saw Game of Thrones already.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.200
Wait, you didn't watch that show.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.200
This guy knows.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:44.200
What?

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.200
You don't watch that show?

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:48.200
No, I don't.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.200
What kind of accusation is that?

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.200
Why wouldn't Spencer watch Game of Thrones?

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:55.200
You don't watch Silicon Valley?

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.200
Wait, you're not in Game of Thrones.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.200
He basically is.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.200
Yeah.

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.200
Wait, I can pull off that hat.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.200
Do you really watch...

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.200
Well, that's different.

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.200
What?

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.200
You really watch that show?

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.200
Yeah, why wouldn't you think of...

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.200
Because you don't...

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.200
I haven't heard...

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.200
No, no, no, you don't consume much like media.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.200
He's never seen the Indiana Jones movies.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.200
Oh, well, I watch TV.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.200
That's the thing.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.200
I'm more of a TV guy than a movie guy.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.200
He likes the new stuff.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.200
You look like Desperate Maids.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.200
Desperate Maids.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.200
What was it called?

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.200
Tevious Maids, right?

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:33.200
Desperate Maids of Orange County.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.200
No, no.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.200
Devious Maids.

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.200
Real Dungeon Masters of Simi Valley.

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.200
There's just one of them.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.200
That's me.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.200
Well, that's how the story starts.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:48.200
That's you saying that, and you're like, there's just one of them, and it's me.

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.200
And you snap, and then it cuts to another guy.

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:54.200
And he's like, I am the premier Dungeon Master of Simi Valley.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.200
And then the show makes you all go to a party together, and you end up pulling each other's

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.200
hair and diving into a pool.

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:05.200
That does sound real.

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.200
So...

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.200
Did you like the Game of Thrones you saw?

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.200
No.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.200
No, no, no.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.200
I'm just saying I didn't like it.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.200
Why did he like it or not?

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.200
It's not a spoiler.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.200
You Nazis.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.200
I didn't like it.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.200
You didn't like it.

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.200
I think it was a great episode, but I don't like it.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.200
I don't like a lot of great things.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.200
I don't like a lot of great music.

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:27.200
No, we honestly can't, because I was about to ask.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.200
I haven't seen it yet.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.200
I'm not going to spoil anything.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.200
Game of Thrones.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:35.200
I think everyone's going to really enjoy it.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:40.200
I'm just saying words to throw you guys all off guard.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.200
Do you understand what's going on?

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:46.200
Yeah, Dumbledore dies, right?

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.200
Hey!

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.200
Spoiler, buddy.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:53.200
Were you the kid that was running around telling everyone that Dumbledore died?

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.200
Oh, yeah.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:24:01.200
We went to the book release night at two different borders.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.200
Did you really do that?

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:07.200
Yeah, when you work at bookstores for a long time, you start to hate books and people who

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:10.200
like them.

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.200
Did you work at a bookstore?

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.200
Before I worked at the used bookstore, I worked at Borders Borders.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.200
Are there still borders?

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.200
Nope.

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.200
Are there still any bookstores?

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.200
Just like vintage ones?

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.200
There's Barnes & Noble, you know.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:27.200
I wonder if they should split into a Barnes & Noble.

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.200
I don't know why.

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:30.200
Happy Father's Day.

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.200
Who are Barnes & Noble?

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.200
Why did they put their name on it?

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.200
Yeah, fuck those guys.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:39.200
Yeah, I'm going to find out everything about them right now.

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.200
Who's Vaughn?

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.200
And Albertson?

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:46.200
That goes to show you how amazing the...

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:50.200
I do know Jason Subway, though.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.200
You know that books were really popular and you couldn't take your business elsewhere

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:59.200
because the bookstores' names are so shitty, like Barnes & Noble.

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.200
You know, if books had to be invented today, you'd have to call them something like

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:11.200
Laser Blowjob, like the store would have to be called like Mega Max, Super Read.

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:16.200
I publish the super dick book fuck pussy.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.200
So is a Laser Blowjob really precise?

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.200
Yeah.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.200
Oh yeah.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.200
It goes right to, you know, where we like...

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.200
No, no, no, not that part of skin, that part of...

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.200
It's zero teeth.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.200
Zero teeth.

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:33.200
That's the guarantee of a Laser Blowjob.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.200
I know.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.200
Those don't really exist, though.

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.200
That's an urban myth.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.200
You've heard it a thousand times before.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:43.200
This is like, I got the spokesman of the commercial, it's on an all-black set, like an onyx set,

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:46.200
and he's walking towards camera in his gray suit.

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.200
He's like, like, of course, it's a blowjob.

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.200
There's going to be some teeth.

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.200
That is now a matter of the past.

01:25:52.200 --> 01:26:00.200
With Laser Blowjobs, and then they do this CG thing, and spirals around your dick, and...

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:07.200
And then it just cuts to these testimonials of guys going like, I couldn't believe it.

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.200
You know, you think blowjob, the little bit of teeth is okay.

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:18.200
It's like rat hair in your cereal.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:24.200
On paper, Laser Blowjob sounds horrible.

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:31.200
There's a final guy that's like, it's hardly even a job anymore.

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:34.200
I feel like I just got blown.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:38.200
There's a whole, like, backlash to Laser Blowjobs that are like, you know, I like the teeth.

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.200
I thought they were okay.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.200
Oh, yeah, those are the hipsters.

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:47.200
It's somewhere like the David Cross character with the scarf.

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.200
Blowjobs are supposed to involve teeth.

01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:54.200
That's the point of them.

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.200
It makes them feel better.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.200
Okay, anyways.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.200
Yeah, teeth.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.200
What, teeth?

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.200
Don't make us drag it out of you.

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.200
Did you bring a D&D adventure for us tonight?

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.200
Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm here.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.200
Well, I don't, you know, I don't assume anything about you.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:15.200
That's good, that's safe.

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.200
Have you been enjoying being my assistant?

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.200
Yes.

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.200
Conflict of interest.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.200
All right, well, nothing else to talk about.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.200
Father's Day, did you talk to your dad today?

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:31.200
Yeah, you know, my dad's in...

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.200
It's in not American country.

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.200
I'm not sure which.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.200
It's terrible.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.200
I think it's, I think it's Columbia.

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.200
Why does he...

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:39.200
Might be Brazil.

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.200
Why does he go?

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.200
He lives there now.

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.200
What?

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.200
Your dad moved to Columbia?

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.200
Yeah, you know, a lot of things happen.

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.200
A lot of things happen.

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:49.200
And you're not sure which country your dad moved to?

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.200
Well, once it's out of America, it's like, who cares?

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.200
I can't do anything about it.

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.200
Did your dad move there for work?

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.200
Yeah, well, I mean, he's hoping to get work.

01:27:58.200 --> 01:27:59.200
He's just moving there, yeah.

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.200
I mean, my parents...

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:02.200
They're doing all sorts of crazy shit now, you know?

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:05.200
My mom's like traveling the country.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:09.200
I don't know, they got all this money that I'm sure I'm never going to get now.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.200
Just spending it on being alone.

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:17.200
I guess.

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:20.200
I have to be alone broke.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.200
Sucks.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.200
Anyway, well, my dad sent me a letter.

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.200
He got, he, he, he found a pickpocket's hand in his pocket.

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.200
And he punched him in the face.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.200
Jesus.

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:32.200
And it made me realize my dad has punched a lot of people in the face.

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:36.200
Like, he punched a different guy in the face that he thought was stealing something from him.

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.200
We don't know if he actually was.

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:43.200
I saw, he ripped the rear view mirror off of a car of a guy that was driving too fast in a parking lot.

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.200
And then he threw it at him.

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:50.200
He didn't, he didn't hit the car with it, but it's just the, there's such malice there.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:53.200
I mean, I love my dad, but apparently violent.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.200
Everyone deals with divorce in different ways.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.200
That was all before.

01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.200
That's all normal.

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.200
That's part of the course.

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.200
The divorce was the mirror.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.200
He should have been ripping off the car.

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:06.200
He was, he was coming up in unhealthy ways.

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.200
Finally, he was like, oh, wait.

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:10.200
I don't have to punch other men.

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.200
I can just break up my family.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.200
I could punch my marriage.

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:18.200
So they really are separated.

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.200
Yeah.

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:21.200
He's in a different country.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:22.200
When did this, when did this happen?

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:23.200
How long ago?

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:24.200
I don't know.

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:29.200
It was right after he came on the show and he came up behind the table and he was like, he was going, hey, I'm Spencer's dad.

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.200
And then, uh, it was after that?

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.200
After that.

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.200
I don't know.

01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.200
I think our show broke up your parents.

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:37.200
Yeah, no, definitely.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:44.200
I mean, well, I was always confident that once I left, there would be nothing left because my parents were always using me as like the crutch.

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:47.200
They'd be like, oh, I don't know what I'm going to do about your father.

01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:48.200
I don't know.

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:52.200
And it's like, well, I can't be, you know, that's, that's not going to fail.

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.200
You guys want me out of here.

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.200
Let's stay together for, for the kids.

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.200
Our kids are grizzly atoms.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.200
Yeah.

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.200
I mean, our kids are seven feet tall.

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:07.200
When all my friends' parents were getting divorced back in middle school and high school, it seems so fashionable and cool.

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.200
Like I definitely could have cashed it in back then.

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.200
Now it's just like fucking deal with it.

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:13.200
You're 25, you piece of shit.

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.200
Like I don't have any pity anymore.

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.200
That's exactly right.

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.200
Once you hit your 20s, your parents divorcing is just kind of weird.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.200
Yeah.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.200
That's, that's how I feel about eyeglasses.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.200
I was like,

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:30.200
But, but, but sleep forward 10 years throughout my 20s, I would have been so hot with fucking glasses.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:33.200
I was in the fucking Costco optometrist every day.

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:35.200
Are you sure I don't need them yet?

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:37.200
Because I'd be pretty hot with them.

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:40.200
And like now my eyes are probably a little weaker.

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:44.200
I'll eventually go in and I'll just look like fucking Mr. Roper.

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:46.200
You look like a professor.

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.200
I'm excited about it.

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.200
She's getting turned on.

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.200
Okay.

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:54.200
Well, someone's getting a teethy blowjob.

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:55.200
Teethy?

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.200
I just want you to know I'm there.

01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:00.200
That's a step up from toothy blowjob.

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.200
Teethy.

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.200
All of the teeth are involved.

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:07.200
Every single one makes an appearance.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:20.200
They can you some of the molars.

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:25.200
Not just the vestigial blowjob tooth that like a bird uses to get out of its shell.

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:30.200
Just wanted to know up here.

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:41.200
That's the sound toothy blowjob.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:47.200
Have either of you received such a job and not said anything and just kind of like suffered through it?

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.200
You don't ever say anything.

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:53.200
You kind of be like, hey, first of all, thank you so much.

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:56.200
Listen, forever in your death, debt, etc.

01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:01.200
Definitely. You don't give someone notes on their performance at a soup kitchen.

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:08.200
You kind of an asshole with that ladle.

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.200
Oh, really?

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:13.200
Maybe I should never come back here ever again.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:17.200
No, thank you for coming down here and giving us soup.

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.200
You're a hero.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:24.200
It's not the best soup I've ever had, but it's fucking soup.

01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:30.200
Even terrible soup is better than no soup.

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:37.200
I think in the past, I think if somebody asks, if somebody asks for notes.

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.200
Really?

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.200
I'm always like A plus.

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:47.200
At pillow talk, if they go, do you like the way I, you know, if they are like, oh, you want to, really, you want to, I mean,

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:54.200
and then I start with the, I go like, you're fucking aces, great, no problem.

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:55.200
Thanks for doing it.

01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:06.200
And then it's like, if pressed for it, if there were teeth involved, I might say, oh, I guess maybe, do you know that I don't want teeth involved?

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.200
Oh, there's one more thing.

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:14.200
It's super painful, isn't that kind of a crazy thing to just kind of let go?

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:18.200
Like if someone, if someone were like, there was the other way around.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:21.200
Listen, no one's like gnawing on your thing down.

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:22.200
That's not happening.

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.200
No, no one's gnawing on my thing.

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:27.200
It's just like a bit of rat hair in your cereal.

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.200
Right, right, okay.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.200
So it just comes in and, you know.

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:37.200
Yeah, I would take the worst blowjob I've ever had over the best pizza I've ever eaten.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:42.200
Yeah, I mean, if the goal, because for some strange scientific purpose, they're like, okay, let's create the perfect blowjob.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:45.200
All right, you want to go down this road, I guess we could try.

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:50.200
But I have a feeling the notes would result in a lot of...

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:51.200
There would probably be...

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.200
No more blowjobs.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.200
Well, I don't know.

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.200
Or the next time it's like, like this?

01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:58.200
Like you said, okay, all right.

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:00.200
You don't have to be sarcastic.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:04.200
Yeah, keep your blowjobs here.

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.200
I said ballplay, not racket ball.

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:11.200
Yeah, I don't need an ironic blowjob.

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:14.200
I wish there was a cooler term than blowjob.

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.200
Blowjobs sound so...

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:18.200
Or ballplay, or teethy, or anything.

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:22.200
First of all, like suckjob is a much more descriptive.

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.200
Well, do you know, I read this somewhere.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.200
Nobody's ever blowing on that.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:35.200
The etymology of the word blowjob is, they think, comes from the idea of, it's not what you think.

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:42.200
It's not the idea that the vendor of the merchant...

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.200
I was going to say woman, and then I was like, 2014?

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.200
Fuck it.

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:47.200
Yeah, no, you're right.

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:48.200
Who knows?

01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:50.200
The vendor is way more sensitive.

01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:51.200
The provider.

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:53.200
The giver, yeah.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:59.200
The idea isn't that that person is doing anything.

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.200
I mean, blowing, sucking, anything.

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.200
It's nothing to do with that.

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.200
It comes from the idea of blowing off steam.

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:10.200
It's the receiver blowing.

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:11.200
They're blowing off steam.

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:12.200
Blowing is wad.

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.200
Blowing is load.

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.200
Blowing.

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.200
Yeah, it's a Victorian slang.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.200
It's Victorian slang.

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:23.200
Because it was like a quick dirty, like, give him a blowjob.

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.200
Let him blow off his steam.

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.200
Yeah, let him relax a little.

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:31.200
It's a steampunk terminology.

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:35.200
I really think that's how they understood humanity to work,

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:37.200
had to do with steam.

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:38.200
And it comes from that.

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:39.200
That's what I read.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.200
I was like, oh, that actually makes so much more sense

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.200
than all these years of going like, why do they...

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.200
Yeah.

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.200
That is not ever part of it.

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.200
Stop doing that.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.200
I'm not a balloon.

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:53.200
Yeah, I'll take teeth over that.

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:56.200
I thought when I was a kid, I didn't know what it was.

01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.200
I'd heard the term.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:00.200
I thought it was that the point was for the person

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.200
to blow air into the hole.

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:03.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.200
And that's what felt really good.

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.200
Of course you would think that.

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:08.200
I was like, I want to do inflate all the way.

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:11.200
Of course you would think that because when you're a kid,

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.200
you have a little wiener and you look down at it,

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.200
and the obvious analog is...

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.200
It's like a little hole, yeah.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.200
...is the stem on the basketball or the tire of your dirt bike.

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:22.200
You're like, oh, a blowjob.

01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:24.200
I'm going to get a blowjob one day.

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.200
Oh, I guess that'll be when someone bumps me up

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:30.200
with this little doodad down here.

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.200
Would that feel good?

01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:34.200
I doubt it.

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:36.200
I bet it wouldn't feel terrible.

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.200
I mean, yeah, in a world where...

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.200
Does it have like a compressed air thing

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.200
that you used to clean off like your keyboard?

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:44.200
Well, that would feel weird.

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:45.200
I bet that would feel good.

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:48.200
I'm not talking about inserting it into the urethra

01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:49.200
I'm talking about.

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:52.200
Three inches away, like it's a circuit board.

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:56.200
I'm really... I'm really trying to dust it off.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.200
I bet it would feel good.

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:58.200
I bet it's great.

01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.200
There's always some splatter in that.

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.200
You know the liquid that's always in there?

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.200
Oh, it frees your dick.

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.200
Yeah, no, you're going to burn your dick.

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.200
Burn it?

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.200
Yeah, like, you know, the...

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.200
But like a fun burn.

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.200
There's very little...

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:11.200
There's very little you can do to the dick

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:13.200
that would really hurt it and you'd know what it is.

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.200
If you're like, with this hurt it or not,

01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:16.200
it probably won't, it'll be great.

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:19.200
There's very little fun in burning something.

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.200
But it's like a freeze burn.

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.200
Like candles.

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.200
It is like a freeze burn.

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.200
I don't see your point.

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:25.200
That's still bad.

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.200
No, but listen.

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.200
Like take down your pants.

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.200
Someone grab a thing.

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.200
I mean, listen, okay.

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:32.200
It would feel like having your tongue stuck to a frozen pole

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:33.200
except it's your dick.

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:34.200
It would be terrible.

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.200
Like, you sure it's fine.

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:40.200
I've had that spray stuff on my hand and my body.

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.200
It burns for minutes.

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:43.200
Yeah, it's like...

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.200
But it burns fun, right?

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:48.200
In the way that have it like inflicting pain on yourself is fun.

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:51.200
Like sometimes you prick yourself with like a thumbtack and that's fun.

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:52.200
It's not...

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:54.200
Like when you get your dick involved, that's a whole...

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.200
Oh yeah, I mean, I'm masochistic, sure.

01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:00.200
Okay, I have done that freeze thing to myself all the time.

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.200
And it's like a fun burn.

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.200
It's not like a thumb burn.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.200
Are you joking?

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:07.200
You use compressed air on your penis?

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.200
No, but I've done it on my arm and it feels fine

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:13.200
and I had never thought of it until now

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.200
and I swear to you within a week.

01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.200
I won't do it.

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:20.200
Tonight in Los Angeles, the staples are going to be...

01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:21.200
Yeah.

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.200
So there's going to be a...

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.200
I swear, while you guys were talking in my head,

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.200
I was like, well, it's after 10, staples is going to be closed when I'm done.

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:31.200
Hey, did you ever hear that thing?

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:35.200
Did you ever talk about that thing, that tape head cleaner thing with the...

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:40.200
Speaking of staples and things you can buy there for sexual purposes?

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:45.200
There's a VHS head cleaner fluid.

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.200
That's like a thing that people would huff it.

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:51.200
And it dilates your butt hole.

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:53.200
Butt hole.

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:54.200
Yes, it does.

01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:58.200
Which I didn't even think dilating it would be like...

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:00.200
Like, why would you...

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.200
Like, oh, make it nice and big.

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:03.200
Well, no.

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:07.200
That's not what I wanted when I looked at you across the room.

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.200
I didn't want a dilated butt hole.

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.200
I want to snug little...

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.200
But even dilated, I bet.

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:16.200
Glove finger.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.200
I'm assuming.

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:22.200
Putting myself in the shoes of a man about town.

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.200
What am I in the market for?

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.200
I want it good and dilated.

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.200
Well, then...

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:31.200
Well, then just get a bucket of water.

01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.200
Put it in the coffee cup.

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.200
Is it the idea that it's tiny?

01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:37.200
No.

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.200
No?

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.200
But even a dilated butt hole is pretty tiny.

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.200
Probably.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.200
Isn't the idea more about the receiver's pleasure

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.200
when it comes to dilating your butt hole?

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:48.200
Oh, okay.

01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:49.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.200
When you're cross-dating the way your body is,

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:52.200
it's not like...

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.200
Okay.

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:55.200
Like, the brain wants.

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:57.200
The reach exceeds the grasp.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.200
You're like, I want something up my butt,

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:00.200
but my butt doesn't know that.

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:01.200
My butt...

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.200
My butt's just doing its job.

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:05.200
It's keeping everything in.

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.200
But I want...

01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:08.200
I'm Timothy.

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.200
I want...

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:11.200
I want...

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:13.200
I want something up there.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.200
So then you go to Staples.

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.200
Yeah.

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.200
You're like...

01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:18.200
Boing?

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.200
Is that the sound?

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.200
And then...

01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.200
Mr...

01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:25.200
Mr. Henderson, I'm here.

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:26.200
To clean your pool.

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:28.200
Now I'm just writing a whole gay port of...

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:29.200
Yeah.

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.200
Timothy and Mr. Henderson.

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:32.200
Yeah.

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:35.200
Tommy, I have on this extra tape cleaner.

01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:37.200
And these things are...

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:39.200
But are we using a VHS player anymore?

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.200
Oh, geez, Mr. Henderson.

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.200
I just came from Staples.

01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:44.200
I'll clean the pool now.

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:45.200
Tommy, do you...

01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:48.200
Are you saying you like to go to Staples?

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:50.200
Oh, geez, you know...

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:54.200
It's the one-stop-trip for all your office supply needs.

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:56.200
Boy, you know, Mr. Henderson,

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.200
you really ought to put more chlorine in your pool.

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:01.200
There's a lot of plankton in here.

01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:05.200
Swish, swish, swish, swish.

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.200
That sounds like Rick, doesn't it?

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.200
Morty.

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.200
Morty.

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:11.200
Morty.

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.200
Ah!

01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:13.200
Tommy!

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.200
Yeah, it sounds like Morty.

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:15.200
All right, okay.

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.200
All right, well...

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.200
Should we do some D&D?

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.200
Yeah, we got 11 minutes.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.200
Oh, we need another person, right?

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.200
Do we?

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:22.200
We could...

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.200
Oh, you would play Jeff's character

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:25.200
because you're Comptroller.

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:27.200
Aaron would play Mulraine.

01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:30.200
Yeah, I guess we need a volunteer to...

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.200
Dan.

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:32.200
Who's really earned...

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.200
Well, Dan had his moment of the sun.

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:36.200
I'll be Christopher.

01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:39.200
Wait, let's not...

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.200
Well, actually, let's use that guy

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.200
because otherwise he'll be so embarrassed

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.200
that he shouted that out, right?

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:45.200
What?

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:46.200
Someone said I'll be Christopher.

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:47.200
Who said that?

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.200
Come on up.

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:54.200
Hello, what is your name?

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.200
I'm Mark.

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.200
Mark.

01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:57.200
Mark, everybody.

01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:59.200
Hey, how's it going, guys?

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.200
And Mark is wearing a shirt that says Cox Barrow.

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.200
Oh, okay.

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:05.200
Mark, are you from LA?

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.200
I'm from San Diego,

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.200
but I moved to LA like two years ago.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.200
Oh, where in San Diego?

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:11.200
Escondido, North County.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:14.200
Cool, I'm from Rancho Bernardo.

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:15.200
Are you really?

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:16.200
Yeah, man.

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.200
Those are adjacent cities.

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.200
I know, I worked at that mall.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:20.200
I worked at Hot Topic in Escondido.

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:21.200
Are you kidding me?

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:22.200
No, I'm not kidding.

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:24.200
You probably saw...

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.200
You bested me walk in there

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:28.200
and buy, like, wrist guards

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.200
and weird, like, stuff like that.

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:31.200
Oh, right, cool.

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:32.200
Why are you...

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:34.200
Why does it sound like you're mocking him?

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:36.200
Yeah.

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:38.200
Is that the San Diego accent?

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.200
I'm not mocking him.

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.200
I guess it does sound like I'm mocking him.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:41.200
I just wanted to do...

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:42.200
It's the San Diego accent.

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.200
It does remind me of home.

01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:46.200
And I guess I did talk like that for a while.

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:47.200
And I worked at Hot Topic.

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.200
I didn't know that was a San Diego accent.

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.200
It just sounds like,

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:51.200
oh, cool, yeah, did you do that?

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:52.200
Oh, awesome.

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:56.200
You fucking piece of human shit.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:57.200
Sounds great.

01:42:57.200 --> 01:42:58.200
I'll take ten.

01:42:58.200 --> 01:42:59.200
Yeah.

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:00.200
Fuckface.

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:03.200
What'd you have for breakfast this morning?

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.200
Oh, rad!

01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:05.200
Fuck off!

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:11.200
Gets a little gnarly down there.

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:12.200
Dad's getting gnarly.

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:14.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.200
Do you bored?

01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:17.200
I don't bored.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:18.200
I'm sorry.

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.200
No bored.

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.200
Do you dilate your butt?

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:23.200
Also, how old are you?

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.200
Before I...

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:31.200
Because you may have come here with your dad for Father's Day.

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.200
No, my dad's an Escondido boarding.

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:35.200
Don't worry about it.

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.200
Cleaning VHS tapes.

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:40.200
All right, we're going to do a little eight-minute

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.200
lightning round of D&D.

01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:43.200
Yeah.

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.200
So who is...

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.200
It's Mark, right?

01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:46.200
Yeah.

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:49.200
Mark will be playing...

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:50.200
They should be in order.

01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:52.200
I wish we could play for longer.

01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.200
I kind of like the eight minutes.

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:55.200
Oh, sometimes we go overtime.

01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:56.200
Yeah.

01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:57.200
Yeah.

01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:58.200
Oh, it's a little fast.

01:43:58.200 --> 01:43:59.200
We've got ten minutes.

01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:00.200
I can't trust anybody.

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:01.200
Here, pass them down.

01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:02.200
I got mine.

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:03.200
Thank you.

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.200
Sorry.

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.200
A clock's a machine.

01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:08.200
Thank you.

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:09.200
Can't argue with that.

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:14.200
I found a top-down, top-down, turn-based RPG...

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:16.200
Yeah, almost at all that I might like.

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:17.200
I can't remember what it's called.

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.200
iOS game?

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:20.200
Swords and Liberty or...

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.200
I love both of those things.

01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:25.200
It's got a really generic name.

01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:26.200
There's no...

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.200
I just really like...

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.200
I've been searching forever for just...

01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:32.200
I just want a nice top-down, turn-based RPG...

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:33.200
Yeah, a little strategy.

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.200
Dungeon Crawler.

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:35.200
It's sort of...

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:36.200
Oberon?

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:37.200
Pokemon.

01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:38.200
Oh, Pokemon.

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.200
Wait, people love the new Diablo III, I suppose.

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.200
That's not turn-based.

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.200
That's not turn-based.

01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.200
No, fuck Dark Souls, man.

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:46.200
I can't...

01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:47.200
You tried that.

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.200
It's the Sudoku of video games.

01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:52.200
Oh, I should've...

01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:57.200
I guess I'll start over, and this time I'll wear corn for a hat.

01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:58.200
That was the old...

01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:03.200
That was a big mistake I made that cost me three hours.

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:06.200
That's how your Sudoku experience is?

01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:07.200
Yeah, like Sudoku.

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:09.200
It's like, I tried it once, and I'm like,

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.200
oh, this is kind of fun, and then I realized...

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:12.200
You needed a different hat.

01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:13.200
After six hours, I was like,

01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.200
oh, I haven't been doing this right at all.

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.200
Okay, cool.

01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.200
Well, I mean, is Dustin gonna music me?

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:23.200
Am I gonna...?

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:24.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:25.200
All right, here we go.

01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:26.200
Sorry, everybody.

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.200
I'm a diva.

01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:30.200
I require musical stuff.

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:37.200
Last time on Harmontown, our heroes had made it to the Floating Isle of Paradise

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:41.200
with the help and unwitting sacrifice of the Seekers of Paradise.

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:45.200
They had arrived, and after meeting and greeting with Yomiji,

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:48.200
the angelic guardian of the realm,

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.200
they found the Tarragon of Virtue and used it to cure Christopher,

01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:56.200
unleashing the demonic and ghostly Admiral Darkstar,

01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:01.200
who possessed Yomiji's body and compelled the angel into mortal combat.

01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:04.200
In the fierce battle, the island caught fire,

01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:08.200
enveloping in the field of battle and blazing flames and choking smoke.

01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:10.200
The gang resolved to escape,

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:13.200
but then quickly changed their minds, deciding to fight,

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:17.200
activating their armulets and unleashing their elemental powers.

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:23.200
But even Quark's sleep could not extinguish the consuming conflagration of the island.

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:26.200
The gang fired arrows and slashed at Yomiji,

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:28.200
but nothing seemed to be working.

01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:32.200
Finally, Sharpie had a quick burst of insight,

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:36.200
and blasted the angel with reduced person,

01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:38.200
shrinking his form by half,

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:41.200
turning the hulking arcan into an average Chad.

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.200
But would our heroes be able to cut down their fun-sized foe,

01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.200
or would the fun fail to free our friends from fates fiddling fingers?

01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:53.200
Find out next time on Harmontown.

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:02.200
I guess people like alliteration.

01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:05.200
I don't like it too. It's fun.

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:07.200
Questions?

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:09.200
No, these are.

01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:12.200
What if we did a practical joke on Spencer,

01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:15.200
where we all just sat here and silenced him?

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:19.200
I guess he would just slowly kill us with this rampaging monster.

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.200
Okay, so distracted by your alliteration,

01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:26.200
our exact circumstances are that we shrunk this guy,

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:29.200
but we were going to head back for the portal, right?

01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:31.200
Yeah, absolutely.

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:33.200
Before the last episode, you were like,

01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:35.200
let's run, and then at the top of the last episode,

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:38.200
you were like, let's not run, and then you started fighting,

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.200
so that's what was happening.

01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:43.200
Didn't we run back for the portal, or were we just fighting this guy?

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:46.200
You had reduced him to half his normal size.

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:48.200
He's the size of a mere man.

01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.200
Alright, let's kick this guy's ass.

01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:53.200
Knowing that once we do, this spirit will be free,

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:56.200
and that's the feudal part of it.

01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:02.200
You stand amid the flaming isle of paradise surrounding,

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:05.200
you're surrounding the six-foot-tall Yomiji.

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:08.200
It's hard to see because smoke blocks out the sky,

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.200
and wind whips past your faces,

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:12.200
but you can see the clouds above you,

01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:16.200
soaring upwards, away from you.

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:19.200
Then you feel a sense of vertigo as you realize

01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:23.200
that the floating island might not be as floating as it once was.

01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:24.200
Uh-oh.

01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:27.200
In fact, it's starting to fall from the sky.

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:29.200
Oh, shh, that's bad.

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:33.200
And what did we deduce about that portal last time?

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:35.200
When we talked about running back into it,

01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.200
there was shit flying out of it that was hurting us?

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.200
Well, yeah, it looked kind of like a painful portal,

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.200
because you remember the first time you went in

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:43.200
and it sucked you through, it hurt you.

01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:47.200
And the final word was that it's not an option as an exit?

01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:49.200
I don't know.

01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:51.200
I mean, I didn't say that, certainly.

01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:54.200
I don't know how you guys came to whatever decisions you did last week.

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:56.200
Do any of us have tape head cleaner?

01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.200
It might be easier to get back in that portal.

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:00.200
Get that portal widened out, yeah.

01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.200
Just widen it up.

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:10.200
So we're trying to jump up into the portal?

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.200
No.

01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.200
Well, you're standing on this floating island.

01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:14.200
It's on fire.

01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:16.200
You're surrounding this angel guy who you've been fighting.

01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:18.200
Well, now we can kill him, right?

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:21.200
Can I put out my flaming sword and attack this thing?

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:23.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:25.200
Oh, shit, I need dice.

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:29.200
Is this tape head cleaner thing real?

01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:30.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:33.200
Yeah, it's, yeah, tape head cleaner, like, yeah.

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.200
When you're picking up that compressed air pickup, some of that tape, I think.

01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:39.200
Now, also, I heard the same thing about Abel Naitre Poppers,

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:42.200
that that's part of the effect.

01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:45.200
It gets you high, but it also makes your butt hole get bigger.

01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:46.200
Is that right?

01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.200
I don't know.

01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:49.200
We have a staples party we'll all find out.

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.200
You are rotting vociferously when he said that.

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.200
Poppers are a real triple threat.

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.200
But isn't that what Gary Oldman's doing in The Professionals?

01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:59.200
So when you watch that movie, he's like,

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:04.200
I love Mozart, whatever it is, like, is his butt hole, like, like, dilated?

01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:05.200
Yeah.

01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:07.200
He's just shitting his pants.

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.200
I think you're just more open to the world when your butt hole is dilated.

01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:14.200
You're open to every, you're literally more open to the world.

01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:15.200
Yeah.

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:16.200
In every way.

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.200
Yeah.

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:18.200
Mozart.

01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:21.200
Anything else you want to get in there?

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:24.200
I really want to try it now after all this talk.

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.200
Which is a C.

01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:27.200
That's good old fun.

01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:32.200
Okay, so I get up my flaming sword and I go and I go right at it.

01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:34.200
You go right at it.

01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:37.200
Cleaving a hefty strike directly towards his torso,

01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:40.200
but he neatly parries with his flaming shovel.

01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:43.200
It seems he's not out of the fight just yet.

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.200
I think we should go into the portal.

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:48.200
Get out of here.

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:50.200
We accomplished our goals.

01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:51.200
Yeah, you're right.

01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:54.200
I don't want to overstate things, but yeah, we came here for a reason.

01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:56.200
Paradise is fall and this guy.

01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:00.200
If we kill him, he's got a gagu in him that goes into the next guy.

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:01.200
All right, yeah.

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.200
I say we run for the fire exit.

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:04.200
Definitely.

01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:10.200
Sometimes heroism looks identical to cowardice.

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:13.200
But running away from something always looks like cowardice.

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:18.200
Yeah, but if you run away long enough, you'll come back around the other side.

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:20.200
Let's run away from...

01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:22.200
Columbus ran from Europe.

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:24.200
Look what happened.

01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:26.200
All right.

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:28.200
America happened.

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:31.200
I shouldn't have to spell this out.

01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:35.200
So you look around for the portal, but it's not where you left it.

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.200
Shit.

01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.200
You look up.

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:40.200
It seems it's maybe about 20 feet and falling fast.

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:42.200
Fuck an island's falling.

01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:45.200
I tie...

01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:47.200
Okay, I have 100 feet of rope, everybody.

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.200
100 feet of rope.

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:52.200
I'm going to tie the rope to my foot,

01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:55.200
and then I'm going to use my boots of spry springing,

01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:59.200
and I'm going to hop up into the portal,

01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:01.200
leaving a rope behind for everybody to...

01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:02.200
I'm going to climb up.

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.200
Yeah.

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:04.200
Yeah.

01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:05.200
Okay.

01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:06.200
All right.

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:07.200
Tada!

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:09.200
Using your boots of spry spring,

01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:12.200
you spring spryly up towards the portal

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:14.200
and grasp its razor sharp edge.

01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:20.200
Your hands are sliced by the polygons of the portal's edge,

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:23.200
but you catch hold, blood drips into your eyes,

01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:25.200
but you know you're going to be able to climb through this.

01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:26.200
I am a hero!

01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:27.200
Wow!

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:28.200
Woo!

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:38.200
You pull yourself through into the ruined hideout

01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:40.200
of the Seekers of Paradise.

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.200
That's where the portal came from.

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:44.200
You're safe with a rope on your foot.

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.200
Get to that rope, gentlemen.

01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:51.200
The rope's being, you know, pulled by the falling,

01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:52.200
but you get it.

01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.200
Who wants to get it?

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:54.200
We all do.

01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.200
Yeah.

01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:56.200
Who goes first?

01:52:56.200 --> 01:53:01.200
Well, as a tortured artist in this falling rock of paradise,

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:03.200
I'm kind of like the band in Titanic.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.200
I feel like I should sing Lady in Red

01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:07.200
as this thing falls to its death.

01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:09.200
And steps are giving me a good send-off.

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:11.200
But I also go for the rope.

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:12.200
Well, yeah.

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:13.200
Okay, yeah, yeah.

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.200
Also the rope.

01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:15.200
Just making sure.

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:16.200
Maybe it was cool.

01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:17.200
Let me go last.

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:21.200
I can use my teleport cape to grab it no matter how high it goes.

01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:24.200
So you guys go before me.

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.200
I feel like I should mention that.

01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:27.200
That's used up for the time.

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:28.200
Fuck you.

01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:33.200
You're such a fucking dungeon master.

01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:36.200
It's like I enforce some rules.

01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:37.200
All right, fine.

01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:38.200
I grab the rope.

01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:42.200
I kick everyone out of the way.

01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:44.200
You grab the rope first.

01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.200
It's gonna be Father's Day.

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:50.200
You guys continue to grab different parts of the rope.

01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.200
I don't know why I'm describing that.

01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:56.200
As you sing a soulful melody.

01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:57.200
I do.

01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:00.200
Lady in red.

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.200
It's a great song.

01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:03.200
You see the island fall away from you

01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:05.200
as Yomichi looks up going,

01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:08.200
GEEEW!

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:13.200
And then he realizes he has wings and flies away.

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:17.200
You guys are just hanging from a hole in the sky.

01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:19.200
Can we crawl up it?

01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:20.200
Yeah.

01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:22.200
We destroyed a whole island.

01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:23.200
It's okay.

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:26.200
Don't think about the past.

01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:27.200
I can't.

01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:29.200
It's gone.

01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:32.200
So yeah, you guys pull yourself up into this portal.

01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:34.200
You each take some damage though.

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:38.200
It's okay.

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:44.200
Mulraine takes five, not Christopher, but Quark takes eight.

01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:47.200
Christopher takes one and you take two.

01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:49.200
Got off easy.

01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:52.200
So you pull yourselves into the ruined.

01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:53.200
What do you call it?

01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:54.200
Hideout.

01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:55.200
What did I call it?

01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:57.200
Hideout of the Seekers of Paradise.

01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:58.200
It looks like a bomb went off.

01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:00.200
All the things, there's furniture.

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.200
It's sheared in half.

01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:03.200
Everything's just shattered and exploded.

01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:08.200
And half the stuff that used to be in the room has just gone completely.

01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:10.200
This is shitty in here.

01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:14.200
The portal still stands though, just kind of like an open sore in the sky.

01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:18.200
And there's nobody else in here except for us, right?

01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:24.200
Well, you do see that, you know, scattered mutilated body parts of the gnomes

01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:27.200
that exploded when you unleashed that portal.

01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.200
I searched their bodies.

01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:30.200
Jesus.

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:31.200
You see it.

01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:33.200
Listen, we're just being practical.

01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:35.200
We should have been searching bodies all along.

01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:40.200
I put pennies on their eyelids and looked for letters to their parents.

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.200
No.

01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:47.200
You see, there's a torso that seems to have a long dagger, a coin purse,

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:51.200
as well as a small sketch of us, of a female gnome.

01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:54.200
We take everything except for the sketch.

01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:58.200
The other gnomes don't have anything or it's been removed from their body.

01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:00.200
I want to take the sketch.

01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:01.200
Okay.

01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:03.200
I take the sketch and I make it into a necklace.

01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:07.200
Because maybe later someone will be like, oh, I know her, you know.

01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.200
Wait, do you do the necklace now or is it just going to make a necklace?

01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:12.200
Very fast.

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:13.200
Yeah, okay.

01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:15.200
You make a necklace of the sketch.

01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:18.200
Can you describe the sketch a little bit?

01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:20.200
It's pretty shitty to be honest.

01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.200
I mean, this guy was obviously no artist.

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:29.200
But the sentiment shows through, you know, they're obviously a gnome.

01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:36.200
I got to tell you the truth, my OCD, like, I wanted to come in through the portal

01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:41.200
and say to anybody who was waiting on the other side, do not go in there.

01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:43.200
Do not go in there.

01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:44.200
Like that?

01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:47.200
And I couldn't, like, I was like, is there anyone else here?

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.200
Shit.

01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:49.200
You should have said it.

01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:50.200
I didn't want to carry it around with me.

01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:51.200
That would have been a great life.

01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.200
So now it's done and just forget it.

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:53.200
But you know what?

01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:54.200
We all appreciate the life.

01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:55.200
Thank you.

01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:56.200
Yeah.

01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:57.200
We get the same joy from that.

01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:59.200
We all come back in and do the build.

01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:00.200
Yeah.

01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:01.200
No, but pretend we did.

01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:02.200
We just got here.

01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:03.200
Okay.

01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:04.200
Now say it.

01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:05.200
Do not go in there.

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:06.200
Oh!

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:11.200
Father's Day.

01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:12.200
All right.

01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:18.200
Well, we ought to get out of this building and get back to our lives.

01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:20.200
Wait, we're just going home?

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:26.200
Well, I mean, this is the culmination of a big long campaign for us.

01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:27.200
Yeah.

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:29.200
We've only got Kumail's character free of curses.

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:32.200
God, it feels so good.

01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:35.200
He has no dick still.

01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:36.620
Didn't I get a better dick though?

01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:39.200
You have a dragon dick in your bag.

01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:40.200
True.

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:44.700
I didn't want to do it myself, but I think you should attach the dragon dick where your

01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:46.200
real dick would be.

01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:47.200
Oh, most definitely.

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:48.840
I have your blessing.

01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:54.200
I would like to attach the dragon dick on the stump of my former dick.

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:56.200
Like just yourself?

01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:58.200
What do I have?

01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:02.200
You're going to need dick husbandry.

01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:04.200
You can borrow a needle and thread.

01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:05.200
May I?

01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:06.200
That doesn't sound right.

01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:09.200
You're probably going to gnome to do it, like a team of gnomes.

01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:11.200
Yeah, Bill Martikins has a lot of cool gnomes.

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:12.200
Let's go look around.

01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:13.200
We'll see if we can find someone.

01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:18.800
Well, step outside this building into the daylight and stretch our arms, and we hear

01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:25.800
the full-lead sounds of wagons clipping and clopping, it's like deadwood sound library

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:28.800
stuff, a little background chatter.

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:33.800
Oh, man, two gold pieces for that.

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:37.800
Get your coffins here.

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:44.800
And you find yourselves out front of a, what is it now, Spizwad's weird bungalow, the

01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:48.800
magical fellow from before, he got you to steal all those cigarettes.

01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:51.800
I guess he didn't steal them, but you know, whatever.

01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:53.800
He was going to help you magically.

01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:55.800
He might be a guy.

01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:59.800
Is he going to be upset because we just came out of a building with like gnome body parts

01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:00.800
in it?

01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.800
We're not going to tell him.

01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:07.800
I hide my picture.

01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:11.800
Yeah, let's get our story straight about this.

01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:17.800
We went to a secret gnome meeting where they play with buttons at open portals.

01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:19.800
That's on them.

01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:25.800
We were there when it happened, but we just leave out the parts where we did anything.

01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:29.800
I mean, overall, what are we doing?

01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:31.800
Do we have a mission for good?

01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:33.800
Are we just always trying to save our own necks?

01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:34.800
Do we have a...

01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:35.800
Jesus.

01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:36.800
Wow.

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:38.800
That is intense.

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:42.800
This world barely has plumbing and you're asking questions like that.

01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:43.800
I'm impressed.

01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:49.800
I mean, I've seen a lot of shit on this trip, obviously.

01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:54.800
I just imagine that you were petting my head, I guess.

01:59:54.800 --> 02:00:02.800
This is one of those rare moments between campaigns where we finished our shit and we

02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:05.800
were not beleaguered by anything else.

02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:06.800
It's nice.

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:07.800
Yeah.

02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.800
We've been through a lot together.

02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:16.800
Can we all write down the scariest thing that's happened, the worst thing that's happened

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:22.800
on this trip on a little piece of parchment and just sit around a fire and talk about

02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:28.800
it and just throw it in the fire and let it go?

02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:29.800
Yeah.

02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:31.800
I mean, do you want to build a fire now?

02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:32.800
Yeah.

02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:41.800
It seems like this is a good point to sort of end.

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:43.800
But I mean, it's a little sleepy.

02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:45.800
It is a little sleepy.

02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:51.800
There's no reason for anybody to tune back.

02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:55.800
I pretend that I see a woman in a red cloak up the road.

02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:57.800
Is that the lady?

02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:01.800
It is the lady in red.

02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:02.800
Monica!

02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:03.800
Nope.

02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:04.800
Okay.

02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:05.800
All right.

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:06.800
All right.

02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:14.800
I go into the nearest tavern.

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:19.800
You enter the nearest tavern, a place by the name of the Rusty Buckle.

02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:20.800
What's up?

02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:22.800
I follow women.

02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:23.800
As do I.

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:28.800
You just see three gnomes and what looks like a baby standing around a table.

02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:30.800
There's no one else in the room.

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:33.800
Is it an adult gnome that looks like a baby?

02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:36.800
It just looks like a baby.

02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:37.800
It's a baby gnome.

02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:41.800
Fellas, I see your baby is standing.

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:43.800
Not standing.

02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:44.800
No.

02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:46.800
He's in a bassinet?

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:47.800
Yeah.

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:48.800
Okay.

02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:49.800
Does he need a drink?

02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:50.800
What are you guys drinking?

02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:51.800
What are you drinking?

02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:52.800
What are you drinking?

02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:53.800
Gnomes.

02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:54.800
Gnomes.

02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:55.800
Gnomes?

02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:56.800
All right.

02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:57.800
Gnomes?

02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:58.800
Yeah.

02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:01.800
Do you want to have a naps blue ribbon?

02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:02.800
Yeah.

02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:04.800
They definitely do.

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:06.800
A round of noors for my gnome friends.

02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:09.800
I'll get a metal one.

02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:10.800
On the shrug.

02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:12.800
He gets it.

02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:15.800
But yeah, so you get them around.

02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:16.800
They're like, thanks.

02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:19.800
We're going to go back to looking at our shit.

02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:21.800
What are you guys looking at?

02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:22.800
Your baby?

02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:23.800
No, no.

02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:24.800
Just the plans for them.

02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:26.800
Are you going to plan for a baby?

02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:28.800
I mean, yeah, yeah.

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:29.800
The baby's already there.

02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:30.800
You don't need to plan it anymore.

02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:31.800
Yeah.

02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:33.800
The baby just didn't get here without planning.

02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:34.800
How did it?

02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:37.800
Wait, so you're going over the plans for the baby that's here?

02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:38.800
Yes.

02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:40.800
Let me take a look at these.

02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:47.800
It's a detailed multi-layered blueprint schematic that you don't even begin to understand.

02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:50.800
But on the first page, you see something that looks like an eyeball.

02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:52.800
I get this.

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:54.800
You guys make babies?

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:55.800
Yeah.

02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:57.800
Wait, Kork, you're a gnome.

02:02:57.800 --> 02:02:59.800
What was your plan when you were born?

02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:02.800
I mean, I just came out.

02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:04.800
I didn't really have a plan.

02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:06.800
Are these plans to make the baby?

02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:09.800
Or when the baby happens, did the plans for the baby's life?

02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:11.800
No, these are the plans to make this.

02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:13.800
I mean, you guys keep calling it a baby.

02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:14.800
I guess it looks like a baby.

02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:16.800
It's more like a little automaton.

02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:20.800
Oh, it's a cyborg baby.

02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.800
What's a cyborg?

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:23.800
A cyborg?

02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:24.800
Is that like a golem?

02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:25.800
Is it like an android?

02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:26.800
Yeah, it's like a golem.

02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:27.800
What's an android?

02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:29.800
It's like a golem.

02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:30.800
It's like a golem.

02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:33.800
Mr. Gnome, is there somewhere where I can buy one?

02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:35.800
No, no, you just got to make them.

02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:37.800
Okay, can I get the recipe?

02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:40.800
Well, we have these plans, but they're very costly.

02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:41.800
How costly?

02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:43.800
800 gold.

02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:48.800
I think what we should do, and this is a crazy, crazy pitch,

02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:54.800
let's take the baby golem and fucking run out of here.

02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:55.800
I'm down.

02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:57.800
Well, can we at least steal the plans?

02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:59.800
Nah, come on, guys.

02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:01.800
We're not saying this in front of these guys.

02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:05.800
Can we talk over by the gnome equivalent of a jukebox?

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:09.800
Look, I mean, I don't give a fuck what you say to me.

02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:11.800
I'm going to steal those plans.

02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:13.800
And I don't care what the fuck you're going to say to me.

02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:15.800
I'm taking that babe.

02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:20.800
Can I impress upon you guys that we've been through a lot this year?

02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:22.800
How much better would it be?

02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:24.800
Listen, imagine your life right now.

02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:29.800
Now imagine it with a baby robot.

02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:31.800
It's only better.

02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:34.800
These gnomes, they helped us.

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:36.800
We killed them already.

02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:40.800
Well, then what's a few more?

02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:42.800
We're already here.

02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:43.800
We're not killing them.

02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:46.800
We're just taking their baby robot.

02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:49.800
I'm sure we have 800 gold pieces between us.

02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:50.800
You really don't.

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:54.800
I draw my bow and I point it at the gnomes and I say,

02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:56.800
give me the plans, little ones.

02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:58.800
What the fuck?

02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:00.800
Give me the plans.

02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:02.800
They slowly, like, hold their hands up.

02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:04.800
Like, just be careful, you know.

02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:05.800
They're on the table.

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:06.800
Yeah, all right, all right.

02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:08.800
I'm really sorry about this.

02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:11.800
Quirk, Quirk, grab the plans and grab the baby.

02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:13.800
All right.

02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:17.800
Wait, when you started playing with sociopath finder.

02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:20.800
All right, that's enough.

02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:22.800
Let's get it offending.

02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:24.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:29.800
Thanks for coming.

02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:32.800
Thank you, Zach, on audio.

02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:35.800
Thank you, Justin Marshall for recording everything

02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:36.800
with his earphones.

02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:38.800
Thank you, Mark, for playing Christopher.

02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:39.800
Thank you, Dan.

02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:44.800
And who is Bethany for coming up and getting your tickets?

02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:46.800
Thank you, Camille, for filling in.

02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:50.800
Thank you, everybody, and Meltdown Comics.

02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:52.800
And we'll see you next...

02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:54.800
Oh, come to the...

02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:55.800
There's still seats left.

02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:58.800
Come to the LA Film Festival screening tomorrow night.

02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:00.800
Google it, figure out how to get there.

02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:02.800
I'll be there and you can watch the Harbiton documentary.

02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:04.800
You've been waiting for it.

02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:05.800
I don't know.

02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:06.800
I mean, there's got to be a way.

02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:08.800
I tweeted, I tweeted twicke ticket links.

02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:09.800
I tweeted them.

02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:10.800
I'll tweet them later tonight.

02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:11.800
Twitter and ticket links.

02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:12.800
Follow me on Twitter.

02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:41.800
And the Zixler.

02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:52.800
Thank you.
