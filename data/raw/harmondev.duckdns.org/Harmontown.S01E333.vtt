00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Check, check, one, two, hello, gang, how you doing?

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
Oh, sexy late arrivals.

00:28.000 --> 00:38.000
Welcome to Harmontown.

00:38.000 --> 00:48.000
Harmontown is now in session, ladies and gentlemen.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Some ladies and gentlemen and everybody there in between.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm Jeff Davis, here comes total. Let's bring out your Game Master, Jordan Arah.

00:58.000 --> 01:09.000
Spencer Crittenden.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
We are the dreamers of dreams. Let's bring out the dreamer of my dreams.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
Oh, yeah, talking about, talking about the summer and the seasons.

01:26.000 --> 01:34.000
Damn, I remember a girl when you used to be around the way, used to be downtown,

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
used to back in the day, used to seems like it used to be back in the day.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
Damn, used to be back in the day.

01:45.000 --> 01:55.000
Seems like long ago used to be from around the way back in the D to the A to the Y, back in the day.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Okay, all right, that's it.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
That was like a, that was like a summer hit.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah, I accidentally wrote the most touching, you know, if you follow me on Instagram,

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
which you have no choice, I mean, that's like, that's my big platform now.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
Instagrammer, and I was driven from Twitter with pitchforks and torches, you know,

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
or you could look at the variety of otherwise.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
I was driven from it by decent-minded taxpayers who just don't want a monster on their phone.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
You know, look, semantics, but you say monster, I say monstale.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm so squirrely tonight.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
Steve Levy with Ice Bucket, everybody. Steve Levy on the ice solo.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
But I, yeah, I don't know, I've been improvising these songs in my car and then I bring them home.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
How do you do it? Is your phone mounted on a thing?

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
I just got a, I'm like, I'm a moving target here.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
I don't have a, you know, I keep changing my process, but I'm like...

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Are you driving or are you letting Tesla do the heavy lifting?

03:05.000 --> 03:13.000
I'm mostly driving. I mean, I did some singing today, hands-free, but, you know, it doesn't, the difference...

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Do you do the hands-free Tesla stuff? Like, do you actually let the car drive?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
I'm a freeway, yeah.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah, absolutely.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
100%, it's a way better driver than me, for sure.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I mean, I'm not kidding. It has a million sensors.

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
I've always been, I just, I get such a panic about lane changes.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
Like, I'm just so bad at blind spot stuff. I just, it makes it all the worse that I'm so phobic about cutting someone off.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
Okay, so you're on the five freeway. You're going toward the interchange where you could go to Glendale or you could stay on the five.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
And the car knows that you're going to go to Starburns. It changes lanes for you?

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, all of the freeway stuff. As soon as you're, once you're on the freeway, now it'll, yeah, it'll change lanes for you.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
They're upgrading as it goes. It's kind of fun. It feels like you're like a beta tester. It's like they...

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
You are.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
They issue these upgrades, you know?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Again, terrifying.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
Well, it doesn't let you, there's nothing to be, it's not going to let you...

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
But it knows the guy behind you isn't a fucking lunatic and it's not going to run you down?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It knows that, yes.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
It doesn't...

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Thank you, Spencer.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
They just added that.

04:21.000 --> 04:32.000
Did you hear, there's this guy who, like, he died. Supposedly the autopilot just knocked him into the highway defyter or something and just smashed his car all up to death.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
It's, yeah, I'm not going to trust the thing for decades.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
I mean, but what it is, is it's like the best cruise control ever.

04:42.000 --> 04:50.000
It just takes care, it takes like a fucking grunt work and frustration out of, like, driving...

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Are your hands, like, on the wheel and your feet on the pedals?

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah, that's the legal standard. You got to do that, so that's what he does.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
I'm not going to go to sleep. I don't trust the fucking thing, but I will take advantage of it wanting to do the work for me.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
It has sensors all over it that are better at telling me if there's anyone in my blind spot.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Like, I'm still going to look, you know?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm just doing, I'm just more relaxed now.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
It's not like I'm, like, sleeping, it won't let you.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
But what's interesting is how they're, like, rolling out these upgrades.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I didn't want to talk about this. This is a douche talk.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
But it is, it is fun to, like, you're getting these upgrades and, like, it was for a while.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
You get on the freeway and then it would, like, it was, it was, like,

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm going to change lanes, but you have to confirm that I can change lanes.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
How? By using the signal.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
It's just, like, it was just, like, such a, it was, like, what are we doing here?

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
You know, it's like, like, if I'm signaling, like, just let me turn the goddamn wheel.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
But, like, now it's changed.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Now it's, it's, it's like, oh no, it'll signal on its own.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
All you have to do is keep your hands on the wheel because before it changes lanes,

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
it just wants to check in with you and you give a little resistance on the wheel

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
to prove that you're not asleep in the backseat.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Anyways, I didn't want to talk about that.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
I love my fucking car. I think it's so cool.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
I love the people that try to, like, make me not love it.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
When I see you, when I look at your awesome Instagram songs,

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
my question is, are, like, how much are you driving or not driving while you're doing that?

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
I'm probably 95% of the time I'm driving.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Okay.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
Because I'm probably not on the freeway, or if I am, I'm like, yeah,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
the auto driving thing is not, like, it's not Minority Report.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
It's not, it's not like, I did today because I was going all the way to Encino,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
where I was for a while, I was just chilling hands-free while I was making up a song.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
And maybe that's why I came up with this, I'm not going to play it,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
but I just, like, it was, like, this really touching song.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
It was, like, I just started singing, like, what, it was, like, where are my homies?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Where are my friends?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Who wrote this movie? How does it end?

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
Or, or, or, it turned out to be about gay gangbangers from, it was, like,

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
just the way the rhymes worked, it was, like, I got to the end of it and I was, like,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
oh my God, that's so touching. Like, it's not even funny at all.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
In fact, if you perceived it as a joke, then it would be a homophobic joke.

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
So I better be serious about this beautiful love story between two fucking gay dudes from East LA

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
that just want to run away together because a way rhymes with gay,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
but also because it's a beautiful story, anyways.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
I'm assuming we have more people in the audience tonight than usual

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
because of our handsome friends that are here.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
Is that true? How many, how many people are here for our guests?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Okay, thank you.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Great.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I think that was 11.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Oh wait, are you here, did I, did I say something that ended up on TMZ?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Is that why you're here?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
I don't, okay.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Am I racist again?

07:48.000 --> 07:57.000
Um, you know what, I'll field that. I am.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
You were off it for a while, but you're back, baby.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
I tried to quit.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
You got to accept the thoughts already. Give me that or you take a contrary action.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Okay, I don't want to cheat our guests of time, but I just wanted to, like,

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
okay, so I still maintain you are overreacting to the lime scooter thing.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
I think that, you know, there's this new thing that you guys are doing.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
At first you were like, I don't like these scooters because they're new.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
And they're everywhere.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
You don't like new things that are everywhere.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
We were just talking about this backstage.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
That's why you don't support the transgender community or anything like that.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
You hate different things that are sweeping and changing the way people,

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
and challenging people, right?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
No, you're hypocrites.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
Like, maybe your sidewalk is identifying as like, orwellian.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Like, it's a fucking scooter. I think it's a great idea.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Or maybe it's not. Let's find out.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Don't police it.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
That being said, I'm 46.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I'm not going to use one of these things for a while.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I'd see them like, one of these days, I'm going to use one of these.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
They're fun. They're so fun.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
So the day finally came.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
I drive home from work and there's one right in front of my house.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Okay.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
It's parked there.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I'm like, this is probably it because I'm going to be late to Little Dom's,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
which is like probably a seven and a half minute walk.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
It's impossible to drive there in park, et cetera.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
This is scooter time.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
It's four blocks from your place.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Yeah. It was just right enough that I'm like,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
okay, how long is the process going to be of like the first time you do?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm assuming there's a QR code on.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
I'm like, if this is as easy as one of those vending machines with the QR code app,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I'm like, man, am I glad I embraced that technology?

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Like I became Lord of the Fritos and like only in that one city,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
but like maybe I'm going to become scooter guy now.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
This is it. I walked down there and I'm like, I scanned the QR code.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
We're off to the races.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
This is like the map loading.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Okay.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
And this guy my age, he's got a wallet chain.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Oh, good start.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
He's, I just don't understand this impulse from people.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Like he sees me.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
I guess he's a neighbor.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
He felt very comfortable talking to me.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
Like I'm like, he sees me from...

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
He's 100 yards away.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.780
starts walking towards me diagonally across the street

10:22.780 --> 10:27.580
while shouting out in a parent camaraderie,

10:27.580 --> 10:29.340
assumed camaraderie with me because,

10:29.340 --> 10:31.820
but he sees me scanning the scooter.

10:31.820 --> 10:35.340
But he's got filled with so much hatred about the scooters

10:35.340 --> 10:38.420
that he must assume that I'm like reporting the scooter

10:38.420 --> 10:44.900
to the Gen X times or something like, here's another one.

10:44.900 --> 10:48.340
Plus they have too much avocado toast all the time.

10:48.340 --> 10:49.740
Oh, if I'm going to hate millennials,

10:49.740 --> 10:51.780
it's going to be for a really good reason.

10:51.780 --> 10:55.380
But not because of the fucking contributions.

10:55.380 --> 10:59.100
Jesus, because of the other stuff.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.140
Like the dumb name, for instance.

11:01.140 --> 11:03.260
You're trying to get online with the scooter.

11:03.260 --> 11:05.260
So I'm like, yeah, I'm like interacting with it.

11:05.260 --> 11:07.300
And he's just like, how comfortable

11:07.300 --> 11:09.820
could you ever be in the assumption that, oh, he goes,

11:09.820 --> 11:12.460
he goes, you know what I'd like to do with those fucking things?

11:12.460 --> 11:14.620
I'd like to take every single one of those motherfuckers,

11:14.620 --> 11:18.100
put it on my truck, take it to the city dump.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.180
You could do that.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.900
No one's stopping him from doing that.

11:22.900 --> 11:26.820
Also, it's a weird flex, is what the kids would say.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.420
That's a South Park episode, the Halloween episode

11:29.420 --> 11:32.140
where somebody does that and takes all the scooters

11:32.140 --> 11:33.180
and throws them off a cliff.

11:33.180 --> 11:35.940
Oh, shit, man, the Rick and Morty ones not coming out

11:35.940 --> 11:39.060
for three years.

11:39.060 --> 11:41.180
That's why, no, we learned that lesson a long time ago.

11:41.180 --> 11:44.980
Don't, it went fairly, South Park did it to like,

11:44.980 --> 11:46.700
no, South Park's going to do it.

11:46.700 --> 11:47.740
Don't do it.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.020
But anyways, the guy.

11:50.020 --> 11:52.620
So he tries to bond with you about hating these things?

11:52.620 --> 11:55.140
In the time it takes him to finish saying all that,

11:55.140 --> 11:59.020
it's like, back time the edit so that he finishes it

11:59.020 --> 12:03.020
in my face, which is weird.

12:03.020 --> 12:06.420
He starts talking and says, take him out of the city dump.

12:06.420 --> 12:07.220
And now he's here.

12:07.220 --> 12:10.460
And I'm like, hi.

12:10.460 --> 12:14.780
And before I can ask the question, which I'm not going to,

12:14.780 --> 12:19.180
well, here's what I did say, because I'm like, I went,

12:19.180 --> 12:25.140
well, make sure you do that after this thing saves my bacon.

12:25.140 --> 12:25.820
What?

12:25.820 --> 12:26.820
Hell yeah.

12:26.820 --> 12:29.260
And I said, well, I'm late for a meeting,

12:29.260 --> 12:31.220
and I'm kind of mumbling in the stammering,

12:31.220 --> 12:32.500
and I'm not making eye contact.

12:32.500 --> 12:36.980
This guy's clearly like, he's got to be either.

12:36.980 --> 12:44.060
I'm thinking, grip, possibly key.

12:44.060 --> 12:47.500
Well, he had the authority of a key grip.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.140
He might have been best boy.

12:50.140 --> 12:50.640
Oh, boy.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.940
He had an alpha fucking energy, a wallet chain,

12:56.940 --> 13:01.980
like eye contact, like eye fucking looking at shit

13:01.980 --> 13:04.980
that doesn't want to look at him, like eye contact

13:04.980 --> 13:06.540
with everything, especially me.

13:06.540 --> 13:07.460
Who wants to look at me?

13:07.460 --> 13:08.380
Someone look at me.

13:08.380 --> 13:10.220
I got shit to do.

13:10.220 --> 13:13.460
And I mean, the guy that's going to save my life

13:13.460 --> 13:16.140
and steal Cody when the zombies come, you know?

13:16.140 --> 13:18.140
But he crossed the street to engage with you

13:18.140 --> 13:20.060
about this particular thing.

13:20.060 --> 13:23.780
Yeah, I mean, he was kind of like walking in a way

13:23.780 --> 13:27.380
that he was just patrolling the neighborhood

13:27.380 --> 13:32.660
with his little clangy chain, and so then he said,

13:32.660 --> 13:34.700
that's something to talk about, someone to interact with.

13:34.700 --> 13:35.820
He's like, let's be neighbors.

13:35.820 --> 13:37.940
And he starts shouting this thing at me.

13:37.940 --> 13:40.940
So then I go, he doesn't understand because I'm

13:40.940 --> 13:41.900
stammering and mumbling.

13:41.900 --> 13:45.020
I'm like, well, I just, I want to try it out.

13:48.020 --> 13:50.860
But then he doesn't really seem to hear that, which is fine.

13:50.860 --> 13:52.060
I don't fault him that.

13:52.060 --> 13:53.060
I'm not a good communicator.

13:53.060 --> 13:55.860
And then he's like, but the question in my head

13:55.860 --> 13:59.580
was like, what's your proposed beef?

13:59.580 --> 14:01.420
Like, what is it, an eyesore?

14:01.420 --> 14:02.620
You're wearing a wallet chain.

14:06.420 --> 14:09.620
What is the fucking beef is what I want to know?

14:09.620 --> 14:11.700
And I hadn't read any news about it and stuff like that.

14:11.700 --> 14:17.580
But he goes, people are getting on these fucking things drunk

14:17.580 --> 14:21.020
and they're bashing their heads open.

14:21.020 --> 14:26.100
I wanted to say, I didn't say this, but I'm like, oh, oh,

14:26.100 --> 14:29.260
you're a humanitarian.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.980
You love people.

14:31.980 --> 14:34.380
Your beef with the scooters is that you

14:34.380 --> 14:38.420
hope more people that ride scooters,

14:38.420 --> 14:41.660
or you wish that they just had long, happy lives, which

14:41.660 --> 14:43.620
is going to be exemplified by his next statement,

14:43.620 --> 14:45.340
because then he finally takes in that I'm like,

14:45.340 --> 14:48.340
I got my credit card out and I'm trying to do this thing.

14:48.340 --> 14:49.820
And he goes, and I wrote it down.

14:49.820 --> 14:53.700
He literally said, he said, you're not

14:53.700 --> 14:58.180
going to ride that fucking thing, are you?

14:58.180 --> 15:03.900
And I said, yeah, I'm going to try.

15:03.900 --> 15:07.860
And he was like, and he walked away.

15:07.860 --> 15:09.980
And then I never, I got to the point,

15:09.980 --> 15:11.820
I had scanned my driver's license.

15:11.820 --> 15:13.500
I had scanned, you know, it's dark out.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.060
And it took me like eight minutes.

15:16.060 --> 15:17.540
I was like, damn it.

15:17.540 --> 15:19.140
You could have walked there.

15:19.140 --> 15:20.580
I got to that point where I was like,

15:20.580 --> 15:21.980
at this point, you could have walked there.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.860
So now, are you an idiot if you keep going,

15:23.860 --> 15:24.900
or are you an idiot if you stop?

15:24.900 --> 15:26.780
And I just, it asked for a credit card.

15:26.780 --> 15:28.260
And I was like, I'm Audi.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.300
That's what the kids say.

15:29.300 --> 15:32.620
They add a Y to the out.

15:32.620 --> 15:33.900
They don't say that anymore.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.180
Sometimes they say Audi.

15:35.180 --> 15:36.260
Audi 5,000.

15:36.260 --> 15:39.580
That's a reference to the Audi 5,000 automobile.

15:39.580 --> 15:42.580
It's a very modern car.

15:42.580 --> 15:45.940
Another thing they'll say is it's like a G6.

15:45.940 --> 15:48.540
Something will be like a G6.

15:48.540 --> 15:52.700
That means it's like an airplane.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.980
That's Fergie.

15:54.980 --> 15:56.140
You could be Audi 5,000.

15:56.140 --> 15:57.500
You could be like a G6.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.860
Dan, did you ever get on the vehicle?

15:59.860 --> 16:00.620
No, I did not.

16:00.620 --> 16:01.660
I gave up and I walked.

16:01.660 --> 16:02.580
Because it asked for a credit card.

16:02.580 --> 16:04.460
I was like, my driver's license was hard enough.

16:04.460 --> 16:07.540
And that's got a barcode on it that it could scan.

16:07.540 --> 16:08.420
It was dusk.

16:08.420 --> 16:10.860
It was not having a, my phone was not

16:10.860 --> 16:12.340
having a good time scanning stuff.

16:12.340 --> 16:13.500
I quit while I was ahead.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.860
Plus, the thing, and this is the thing that I have.

16:15.860 --> 16:19.100
So if that is your beef, the head injury thing.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.500
So apparently then I go meet my friends at dinner.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.580
And I'm like, oh, there's crazy guy in this beef

16:23.580 --> 16:24.820
that people have with these scooters.

16:24.820 --> 16:25.340
What's the deal?

16:25.340 --> 16:27.860
Turns out all my friends have beef with these scooters.

16:27.860 --> 16:29.300
Like I'm just odd man out.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.820
No one, because they're a hazard.

16:31.820 --> 16:35.620
Like people are, yes, you can go and you can hashtag this.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.340
And you can watch everybody.

16:37.340 --> 16:40.900
I just, the thing set, the reason why I really did give up

16:40.900 --> 16:43.260
is because it told me a thousand times,

16:43.260 --> 16:45.300
you're supposed to be wearing a helmet.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.700
And I was just like, nobody wears a helmet.

16:47.700 --> 16:48.420
Was that a fucking thing?

16:48.420 --> 16:51.020
No one wears a helmet on a bike, but it's also a good idea.

16:51.020 --> 16:52.460
I was kind of, I was worried.

16:52.460 --> 16:53.980
I wasn't really worried about being injured.

16:53.980 --> 16:54.780
I was actually worried.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.580
I was like, between that guy yelling,

16:56.580 --> 16:59.420
this thing harping about helmets, I was like,

16:59.420 --> 17:00.540
it'll be just my luck.

17:00.540 --> 17:02.620
I'll get like pulled over.

17:02.620 --> 17:06.500
Like a community outreach cop program

17:06.500 --> 17:08.060
will be like, you know.

17:08.060 --> 17:12.260
There must have been already DUIs on these e-scooters, right?

17:12.260 --> 17:13.820
Somebody has to 100.

17:13.820 --> 17:14.940
It's the idea is that people are getting drunk

17:14.940 --> 17:17.740
and they're getting on them and they're getting head injuries.

17:17.740 --> 17:20.180
But I'm not one of those people that's like,

17:20.180 --> 17:22.420
ooh, that's the Darwin thing.

17:22.420 --> 17:24.300
But I don't think people should get hurt.

17:24.300 --> 17:25.460
I don't want them to get hurt.

17:25.460 --> 17:27.580
I don't care how bad you are.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.740
I hope Hitler had a good day his last day

17:30.740 --> 17:31.820
before he killed himself.

17:31.820 --> 17:34.100
Like I wish he hadn't killed so many people,

17:34.100 --> 17:36.820
but I also like I don't, I don't, I don't,

17:36.820 --> 17:38.460
I'm not a capital punishment guy.

17:38.460 --> 17:40.740
I don't think they, I don't want people to suffer.

17:40.740 --> 17:42.140
All right, don't take that out of context.

17:42.140 --> 17:45.380
I mean, I hope Hitler had a good day.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.940
Wait, what context should we take that in?

17:49.940 --> 17:51.460
I don't know, actually that could only help

17:51.460 --> 17:53.100
my political numbers right now.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.620
I tell you, I tell you, I should,

17:54.620 --> 17:56.420
I should just get on the bandwagon

17:56.420 --> 17:58.860
that's leaving the station, right?

17:58.860 --> 18:00.060
Do bandwagons leave stations?

18:00.060 --> 18:00.900
All right, come on.

18:00.900 --> 18:01.740
We get it.

18:01.740 --> 18:04.180
We got a big show tonight.

18:04.180 --> 18:07.620
I'm just saying, like, isn't it, it's kind of weird.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.980
It's like, like, like, like, people are,

18:08.980 --> 18:12.060
are you really mad about the people that you,

18:12.060 --> 18:13.460
it's like, pick a lane.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.140
Like, you're grousen about this thing.

18:15.140 --> 18:17.260
Are you, are you really, because you're worried,

18:17.260 --> 18:18.620
it kind of goes back to my, like,

18:18.620 --> 18:19.980
probably the first episode of the show

18:19.980 --> 18:21.940
where I'm like, it's the shoe tying thing.

18:21.940 --> 18:24.620
I'm like, you don't really care if I trip and fall.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.820
You're excited that my shoelaces are untied.

18:26.820 --> 18:29.700
It's like your little, your little corner of the world.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.780
Yeah, you see a shoelace untied.

18:31.780 --> 18:33.700
It's like time for you to be empowered.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.500
I just, I just wish that, that people on the e-scooters

18:36.500 --> 18:40.020
like, do what you want, but obey the regular laws.

18:40.020 --> 18:40.860
Right.

18:40.860 --> 18:41.940
Like, don't be on the fucking sidewalk

18:41.940 --> 18:43.740
and run me down as I walk out.

18:43.740 --> 18:44.580
That was the other thing, yeah.

18:44.580 --> 18:45.420
That's true of bikes, though, too.

18:45.420 --> 18:47.100
Like, there's tons of people who just blow through

18:47.100 --> 18:48.780
intersections on bikes and stuff.

18:48.780 --> 18:50.220
It's like, well, that's kind of dangerous.

18:50.220 --> 18:51.060
I don't like that.

18:51.060 --> 18:54.460
There was one kid, I wanted to murder this fucking kid.

18:54.460 --> 18:55.300
Yeah.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.140
It wasn't the scooter's fault,

18:56.140 --> 18:57.420
but it was just perfect that he was on

18:57.420 --> 18:58.260
one of these fucking things,

18:58.260 --> 19:00.220
and he did have a helmet on, dork.

19:00.220 --> 19:03.340
And, but he was at an intersection

19:03.340 --> 19:05.460
and he's driving in the street

19:05.460 --> 19:06.780
on one of these scooters with a helmet on.

19:06.780 --> 19:08.620
So he's by the book, baby.

19:08.620 --> 19:12.060
I wanted to murder him because he pulled up

19:12.060 --> 19:14.100
to the intersection and he's just,

19:14.100 --> 19:17.940
he's directing traffic at a four-way intersection.

19:17.940 --> 19:20.220
And he keeps like, he's doing that thing

19:20.220 --> 19:21.620
where he's looking at me and like,

19:21.620 --> 19:25.060
because his hand movement isn't making my car move forward,

19:25.060 --> 19:26.940
which would have caused it to collide

19:26.940 --> 19:30.020
with oncoming traffic because it's a fucking intersection.

19:30.020 --> 19:32.980
And he's only focused on the car he wants to move.

19:32.980 --> 19:34.980
Like he's trained for this.

19:34.980 --> 19:36.780
And he's just like getting pissed at me.

19:36.780 --> 19:38.860
And I'm like sealed in my car and I can't go,

19:38.860 --> 19:43.180
you fucking asshole, you're trying to make me die.

19:43.180 --> 19:44.780
This, you know, those people that they start,

19:44.780 --> 19:47.300
they're like, they just have this nervous tick.

19:47.300 --> 19:49.500
They get to a four-way stop and they're like,

19:49.500 --> 19:53.100
they're like, like, all of a sudden they're the boss of you

19:53.100 --> 19:55.740
because like, they're like, oh yeah, you go, you go.

19:55.740 --> 19:58.860
And then you don't, you might have a reason to not go.

19:58.860 --> 20:01.860
Like there's sheep in front of you or something or a bike.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.900
And the person's not, he's only looking at you

20:03.900 --> 20:05.340
and they're like, I said, go.

20:10.140 --> 20:12.140
No, no one can relate to that story.

20:12.140 --> 20:13.340
I can.

20:13.340 --> 20:16.020
You have a bit of intersection, we're sheep crossing

20:16.020 --> 20:17.540
and people are mad.

20:17.540 --> 20:18.860
No, that happens to me all the time.

20:18.860 --> 20:20.140
I think I do that sometimes,

20:20.140 --> 20:22.820
but usually I clock it before like the second wave.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.540
I'm like, oh, there's someone I can't see.

20:24.540 --> 20:25.380
Okay, I'm done.

20:25.380 --> 20:26.660
I'd never take that baton.

20:26.660 --> 20:27.500
I'm not in charge.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.580
It's like, why we go to the fucking driver's ed?

20:29.580 --> 20:31.380
Like what do we, you don't have to worry

20:31.380 --> 20:33.420
about what other people are doing.

20:33.420 --> 20:34.740
What are you doing?

20:34.740 --> 20:36.420
Like waving your hand at me.

20:36.420 --> 20:38.340
I was in Tulsa, Oklahoma last weekend

20:38.340 --> 20:41.460
and it was like Kentucky Derby day.

20:41.460 --> 20:42.420
Are you even listening to me?

20:42.420 --> 20:43.260
Yes.

20:43.260 --> 20:44.100
I'm kidding, I'm just kidding.

20:44.100 --> 20:48.020
I'm expounding upon your thesis here.

20:48.020 --> 20:51.500
There was people that were going to watch the Kentucky Derby

20:51.500 --> 20:54.180
and they were drunk and they were all on e-scooters

20:54.180 --> 20:55.340
around Tulsa, Oklahoma.

20:55.340 --> 20:57.460
And everybody was fucking shit canned.

20:57.460 --> 20:58.860
And it was just a bunch of people

20:58.860 --> 21:01.620
that shouldn't have been driving on an e-scooter drunk.

21:01.620 --> 21:04.660
And I was like, I'm going to watch somebody get murdered

21:04.660 --> 21:07.140
by a moving like SUV.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.300
That could be fun though.

21:09.540 --> 21:11.820
The only argument I understand is like what people say

21:11.820 --> 21:15.380
about like motorcycles or like driving without insurance.

21:15.380 --> 21:18.620
Like it's like you, it's the,

21:18.620 --> 21:20.420
even if it's just you getting injured,

21:20.420 --> 21:22.980
like you can fuck up the lives of people around you

21:22.980 --> 21:24.020
by getting injured.

21:24.020 --> 21:26.460
I mean, it's like, but that's kind of like,

21:26.460 --> 21:27.780
like really that's your reasoning.

21:27.780 --> 21:30.980
Like, you know, like about like why things need to be,

21:30.980 --> 21:33.580
like why you're really concerned about this prayer.

21:33.580 --> 21:34.620
Oh, they're not wearing a helmet.

21:34.620 --> 21:36.980
So if I hit them, I'll be guilty of murder

21:36.980 --> 21:40.100
instead of injuring them.

21:40.100 --> 21:40.980
What are the rules?

21:40.980 --> 21:44.940
Like if you go and you see like a bird or a lime

21:44.940 --> 21:47.780
or whatever the fuck the scooters are and you go see one,

21:47.780 --> 21:50.020
let's say you're 14 years old

21:50.020 --> 21:52.780
and you have your mother's credit card, you can write it.

21:52.780 --> 21:55.220
I think you gotta be 18, but I'm not sure.

21:55.220 --> 21:57.220
I mean, I'm sure you gotta have a credit card

21:57.220 --> 21:58.460
and I'm sure I probably,

21:58.460 --> 22:00.420
they would be smart to say you gotta be 18.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.420
I mean, you know, the kids, they got these things,

22:02.420 --> 22:04.220
they're called skateboards.

22:04.220 --> 22:05.620
I mean, if you're really,

22:05.620 --> 22:07.220
that's the thing that's bumming you out

22:07.220 --> 22:08.700
is like the potential for injury.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.340
You know, these kids are a really,

22:10.340 --> 22:11.700
they're up to no good.

22:11.700 --> 22:14.620
Like they've got all kinds of shit with wheels on it.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.980
Yeah, I saw a little girl the other day,

22:16.980 --> 22:20.460
she had two tiny skateboards on her feet.

22:20.460 --> 22:22.460
She's just licking a lollipop,

22:22.460 --> 22:25.820
whoa, whoa, whoa, like rolling around.

22:25.820 --> 22:28.060
I'm like, I pulled over, I'm like,

22:28.060 --> 22:29.900
you piece of fucking shit.

22:29.900 --> 22:31.940
I'd like to cut your fucking feet off

22:31.940 --> 22:33.780
and take them to the city dump.

22:36.340 --> 22:37.460
Our next guest.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.460
These guys, I just laid eyes on them

22:42.460 --> 22:43.460
for the first time backstage.

22:43.460 --> 22:46.060
They're so handsome for podcasters.

22:47.060 --> 22:49.460
They're really intimidating, like,

22:49.460 --> 22:51.460
intimidatingly good-looking.

22:52.460 --> 22:53.460
Well, let's bring them out.

22:53.460 --> 22:54.460
Okay.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.460
Please welcome Sean and Hayes from the Hollywood Handbook.

23:03.460 --> 23:05.460
There's Sean, there's Hayes.

23:08.460 --> 23:10.460
You guys agree that your hands are wherever.

23:11.460 --> 23:12.460
That's very kind.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.460
That is so nice. Thank you, Dan.

23:14.460 --> 23:18.460
Four podcasters is a good qualification to put on, you know?

23:18.460 --> 23:19.460
You know, I mean.

23:21.460 --> 23:22.460
But otherwise, I'd agree.

23:22.460 --> 23:23.460
All right, or anything.

23:23.460 --> 23:25.460
You guys are cute as buttons.

23:25.460 --> 23:27.460
Actors are podcasting now, though, Dan.

23:27.460 --> 23:28.460
I know.

23:28.460 --> 23:30.460
Anna Farris has a podcast.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.460
We got to get away from this idea

23:32.460 --> 23:34.460
that it's just for the misfits anymore.

23:36.460 --> 23:37.460
These guys are moving in.

23:37.460 --> 23:39.460
I got to stop, right?

23:40.460 --> 23:43.460
It is turned into just mainstream.

23:44.460 --> 23:45.460
I'm not welcome here.

23:45.460 --> 23:47.460
Dan, if I may, actually,

23:47.460 --> 23:49.460
I could kind of tie two things together here

23:49.460 --> 23:51.460
because you were talking about Hayes being handsome

23:51.460 --> 23:53.460
and you were talking about scooters a lot,

23:53.460 --> 23:57.460
and he actually has been known around town lately

23:57.460 --> 24:01.460
as the Scooty Cutie, and he does wear a helmet.

24:01.460 --> 24:02.460
I do wear a helmet.

24:02.460 --> 24:04.460
I scoot all over the place.

24:04.460 --> 24:05.460
I scooted here.

24:05.460 --> 24:07.460
We were talking about it backstage,

24:07.460 --> 24:10.460
and I am sort of becoming known as the Scooty Cutie.

24:10.460 --> 24:13.460
Who has called you the Scooty Cutie?

24:13.460 --> 24:15.460
People yelling from their cars.

24:15.460 --> 24:17.460
I make sense to you.

24:17.460 --> 24:19.460
You'll be scooting down the road,

24:19.460 --> 24:21.460
and someone will go like, hey, Scooty Cutie.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.460
There goes a Scooty Cutie.

24:22.460 --> 24:24.460
You look like kind of a doppler.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.460
Honey, that's the Scooty Cutie.

24:26.460 --> 24:29.460
Are you making that up, or is it an actual thing?

24:29.460 --> 24:30.460
I think it's a Scooty Cutie.

24:30.460 --> 24:32.460
It's hard to hear exactly what they're saying,

24:32.460 --> 24:36.460
but you've chosen to hear a Scooty Cutie.

24:36.460 --> 24:39.460
That has been one interpretation of it, yeah.

24:39.460 --> 24:42.460
Sean also has started scooting a little bit,

24:42.460 --> 24:47.460
and he also has a name, which is the Lime Arita.

24:47.460 --> 24:49.460
Yeah, I only use the Lime Scooters,

24:49.460 --> 24:53.460
and if I'm guilty of anything, it's being a little too sweet.

24:53.460 --> 24:55.460
That's your Scooting style?

24:55.460 --> 24:56.460
It's a little too...

24:56.460 --> 24:58.460
It's a touch sweet.

24:58.460 --> 25:01.460
A little more triple sec than was necessary.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.460
That's right.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.460
Do you want to hear a horrible thing,

25:05.460 --> 25:07.460
a Scooter story that happened on the way here?

25:07.460 --> 25:08.460
Yes, we fucking do.

25:08.460 --> 25:13.460
I was riding on the sidewalk, which you have to do in a lot of parts of the city.

25:13.460 --> 25:15.460
This is just way too dangerous to be in the street.

25:15.460 --> 25:18.460
And I was coming up on...

25:18.460 --> 25:20.460
Citizen's arrest.

25:20.460 --> 25:28.460
Approaching me were an older couple pushing a shopping cart full of cans,

25:28.460 --> 25:32.460
and I start to move into the street, but it is way too late.

25:32.460 --> 25:37.460
They are fully taking their shopping cart and moving it out of the way

25:37.460 --> 25:40.460
so that I can pass on my Scooter.

25:40.460 --> 25:42.460
And I thought, I'm never taking this again.

25:42.460 --> 25:43.460
This is not fair.

25:43.460 --> 25:45.460
I'm taking up too much sidewalk space.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.460
But then I had an epiphany,

25:47.460 --> 25:51.460
which is that me and these guys should team up against the cars.

25:51.460 --> 25:54.460
And we should take over the street.

25:54.460 --> 25:57.460
Those are the real enemies, are the cars.

25:57.460 --> 25:59.460
You're supposed to be on the street.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.460
You're not supposed to use those on the side.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.460
Which is why Citizen's Arrest.

26:03.460 --> 26:07.460
You broke the law, you confessed, it's recorded.

26:07.460 --> 26:10.460
They're also not supposed to have a shopping cart.

26:10.460 --> 26:11.460
Exactly.

26:11.460 --> 26:13.460
So we ended up arresting each other?

26:13.460 --> 26:15.460
Yes, we're finally punching up.

26:15.460 --> 26:17.460
Let's get the guys with the shopping carts.

26:17.460 --> 26:19.460
Finally punching up.

26:24.460 --> 26:27.460
It is so hard for me to punch up these days.

26:27.460 --> 26:32.460
I found out a way to punch down without getting called out for it though

26:32.460 --> 26:34.460
because I was telling you guys backstage,

26:34.460 --> 26:36.460
I feel like the next door app.

26:36.460 --> 26:39.460
I was looking through my next door app thing

26:39.460 --> 26:41.460
and I was like, I think you can humiliate these people

26:41.460 --> 26:46.460
without punching down because they are loud and proud about it.

26:46.460 --> 26:48.460
They want people to know.

26:48.460 --> 26:50.460
If they could, they would make the world know

26:50.460 --> 26:52.460
that someone pooped without cleaning it up

26:52.460 --> 26:54.460
outside their apartment or whatever.

26:54.460 --> 26:58.460
I don't think people would be like, oh, you're punching down

26:58.460 --> 27:00.460
by reading their posts out loud.

27:00.460 --> 27:02.460
Yeah, they're property owners.

27:02.460 --> 27:05.460
It's open season on the next door people.

27:09.460 --> 27:12.460
Let's see, how does your phone work?

27:12.460 --> 27:16.460
Who I see sometimes on the next door in my neighborhood is a sclar.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.460
Okay.

27:17.460 --> 27:19.460
I won't say which one.

27:20.460 --> 27:22.460
Here's one that's adorable.

27:22.460 --> 27:24.460
I've known them forever.

27:24.460 --> 27:26.460
I can only remember one of their names at one time.

27:26.460 --> 27:28.460
Which one is it right now?

27:29.460 --> 27:30.460
Randy.

27:30.460 --> 27:31.460
Yeah, Randy.

27:31.460 --> 27:32.460
Yeah, that's mine too.

27:32.460 --> 27:34.460
Yeah, but then the next time it's the other guy.

27:34.460 --> 27:35.460
Yeah.

27:35.460 --> 27:38.460
I mean, what's the reward for learning both sclar names?

27:38.460 --> 27:40.460
You can't tell them apart.

27:40.460 --> 27:42.460
One of them is Eugene.

27:42.460 --> 27:44.460
That gets you nowhere.

27:44.460 --> 27:47.460
You would never approach them and be like Randy, Jason.

27:47.460 --> 27:49.460
You just say like, hey guys.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.460
I mean, this one,

27:53.460 --> 27:56.460
my 19-year-old son needs a summer job.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.460
I just thought that was kind of cute.

28:00.460 --> 28:03.460
As a true crime listener, I just felt like,

28:04.460 --> 28:06.460
And they're out early on it as well.

28:07.460 --> 28:08.460
They're getting a jump start.

28:08.460 --> 28:09.460
Yeah, it's May.

28:09.460 --> 28:12.460
I know, it's like does that son want that?

28:13.460 --> 28:15.460
This is sort of like a pull.

28:16.460 --> 28:18.460
I read this one, this person.

28:18.460 --> 28:20.460
So this person has this security camera footage

28:20.460 --> 28:22.460
that they've posted here in Nextdoor.

28:22.460 --> 28:23.460
And it says,

28:23.460 --> 28:25.460
neighbor leaving dog poop behind,

28:25.460 --> 28:27.460
followed by a hair flip.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.460
Hello, neighbors.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.460
Had to post this video of someone in the neighborhood

28:34.460 --> 28:36.460
who watches her pit bull take a massive poop,

28:36.460 --> 28:38.460
then doesn't even attempt to pick it up,

28:38.460 --> 28:40.460
does a hair flip,

28:40.460 --> 28:42.460
and then appears to reward her dog.

28:42.460 --> 28:43.460
It's true.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.460
Only to leave me to clean up her dog's mess.

28:45.460 --> 28:47.460
If anyone knows this,

28:47.460 --> 28:49.460
here's the thing about it.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.460
You're posting surveillance footage

28:51.460 --> 28:53.460
from a public sidewalk,

28:53.460 --> 28:56.460
and I'm not saying that that should be illegal.

28:56.460 --> 28:59.460
But on the hierarchy of shame,

28:59.460 --> 29:01.460
if I was doing this,

29:01.460 --> 29:03.460
maybe it's a generational thing,

29:03.460 --> 29:04.460
but I would be like,

29:06.460 --> 29:09.460
by the way, I have a fucking camera on the sidewalk,

29:10.460 --> 29:12.460
because someone punched me once.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.460
I would try to,

29:14.460 --> 29:17.460
because I feel like surveilling people

29:17.460 --> 29:18.460
is next door.

29:18.460 --> 29:20.460
You don't have to explain.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.460
I know.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.460
The person is like,

29:23.460 --> 29:25.460
thank God I'm surveilling,

29:25.460 --> 29:27.460
because now I can put this person on.

29:29.460 --> 29:32.460
The next logical step would be that someone would be like,

29:32.460 --> 29:34.460
hey, I put a camera in my bathroom

29:34.460 --> 29:36.460
during a party I was throwing.

29:36.460 --> 29:38.460
Check out this guy didn't wash his hands.

29:38.460 --> 29:40.460
You'd be like, but you shouldn't have...

29:40.460 --> 29:42.460
Why was there a camera in the bathroom?

29:42.460 --> 29:44.460
Because in this neighborhood,

29:44.460 --> 29:46.460
I'm like the Vlad the Impaler.

29:46.460 --> 29:49.460
I live in this big house overlooking all these numbskulls.

29:49.460 --> 29:51.460
I just feel like,

29:51.460 --> 29:53.460
now that I'm seeing this app,

29:53.460 --> 29:54.460
when I leave my house,

29:54.460 --> 29:57.460
I'm like, just don't unleash your dog.

29:57.460 --> 29:59.460
I don't even have a dog with me.

29:59.460 --> 30:02.460
I'm just terrified of unleashing or pooping,

30:02.460 --> 30:04.460
because people will be like,

30:04.460 --> 30:06.460
you know who's at it again.

30:06.460 --> 30:08.460
I'm already a pinata,

30:08.460 --> 30:11.460
but this is a thunderdome, this fucking app.

30:11.460 --> 30:14.460
Okay, here's a weird one.

30:17.460 --> 30:20.460
Dog Bark Collar is the headline.

30:20.460 --> 30:23.460
Dog Bark Collar.

30:23.460 --> 30:28.460
Would any of you lovely Las Felas neighbors

30:28.460 --> 30:32.460
happen to have a very small Bark Collar

30:32.460 --> 30:36.460
I could borrow for my eight pound Javanese puppy?

30:36.460 --> 30:38.460
I'm not entirely sure it will work,

30:38.460 --> 30:40.460
as I've heard some dogs don't care

30:40.460 --> 30:42.460
and just keep barking,

30:42.460 --> 30:44.460
so I would like to borrow one first

30:44.460 --> 30:46.460
to see how he reacts to it.

30:46.460 --> 30:48.460
I'd really love to not have my apartment neighbors

30:48.460 --> 30:51.460
kill me due to his barking.

30:51.460 --> 30:54.460
How is this all happening to you?

30:54.460 --> 30:56.460
This person doesn't have a dog.

30:56.460 --> 30:59.460
They are not using the collar for that.

30:59.460 --> 31:02.460
Too specific on the breed of dogs.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.460
Just too many details.

31:04.460 --> 31:07.460
This person is only not a serial killer

31:07.460 --> 31:10.460
because no one's gotten between them

31:10.460 --> 31:12.460
and breakfast.

31:12.460 --> 31:14.460
They're a sociopath.

31:14.460 --> 31:16.460
They're just showing the early side.

31:16.460 --> 31:18.460
They're 19 and they haven't hurt anyone yet.

31:18.460 --> 31:21.460
This is all one poster?

31:21.460 --> 31:23.460
I couldn't even fathom that.

31:23.460 --> 31:25.460
What's crazy is the fucking respondents.

31:25.460 --> 31:27.460
The collar and the hair flip and the...

31:27.460 --> 31:29.460
No, no, no.

31:29.460 --> 31:31.460
Dan, what platform?

31:31.460 --> 31:33.460
How did this cross your doorstep?

31:33.460 --> 31:35.460
This is an app called Next Door.

31:35.460 --> 31:37.460
Your neighbors are posting things

31:37.460 --> 31:39.460
so you can see what's going on in the hood.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.460
This comes across.

31:41.460 --> 31:43.460
At first it's...

31:43.460 --> 31:45.460
I end up liking this person a lot more

31:45.460 --> 31:47.460
than the people that are responding,

31:47.460 --> 31:49.460
which is crazy because I don't like this person.

31:49.460 --> 31:51.460
I'm like...

31:51.460 --> 31:53.460
Your dog...

31:53.460 --> 31:55.460
It's that very small in caps.

31:55.460 --> 31:57.460
Don't give me the wrong size collar

31:57.460 --> 31:59.460
for my dog.

31:59.460 --> 32:01.460
I need to stop barking so that my neighbors

32:01.460 --> 32:03.460
don't hate me.

32:03.460 --> 32:05.460
My neighbors, who are you?

32:05.460 --> 32:07.460
I've got a lot of stuff happening to me

32:07.460 --> 32:09.460
and I would appreciate it

32:09.460 --> 32:11.460
if it cost as little as possible.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.460
Well, then when a neighbor knocks on the door

32:13.460 --> 32:15.460
to be like, hey, your dog won't stop barking,

32:15.460 --> 32:17.460
it's like, well, I put it on Next Door.

32:17.460 --> 32:19.460
So at that point it was your court.

32:21.460 --> 32:23.460
But it's like the crazy thing is the...

32:23.460 --> 32:25.460
Wait, where are there...

32:25.460 --> 32:27.460
If you had done what I asked...

32:27.460 --> 32:29.460
So who are you mad at?

32:29.460 --> 32:33.460
Me or you?

32:33.460 --> 32:35.460
Okay, there it is.

32:35.460 --> 32:37.460
So then this guy, the first respondent.

32:37.460 --> 32:39.460
So get ready for...

32:39.460 --> 32:41.460
You're like, okay, that's Godzilla.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.460
Well, here comes Mothra.

32:43.460 --> 32:45.460
These responses are going to be people

32:45.460 --> 32:47.460
that live in the neighborhood

32:47.460 --> 32:49.460
that are on your team.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.460
So Robert responds to...

32:51.460 --> 32:53.460
These are first names only.

32:53.460 --> 32:55.460
He's the first responder.

32:55.460 --> 32:57.460
Robert is the first responder

32:57.460 --> 32:59.460
and says,

32:59.460 --> 33:01.460
your dog's barking is caused by emotional

33:01.460 --> 33:03.460
slash environmental issues.

33:05.460 --> 33:07.460
And cannot be silenced

33:07.460 --> 33:09.460
with collars that shock.

33:09.460 --> 33:11.460
Oh!

33:11.460 --> 33:13.460
Fucking Robert.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.460
Robert don't play.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.460
I did forget to read, as did Robert,

33:17.460 --> 33:19.460
that there's a little P.S.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.460
on Jenna's original post which says,

33:21.460 --> 33:23.460
please note, no, I am not going to shock my dog.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.460
I am interested only in the beeping

33:25.460 --> 33:27.460
or vibration mode.

33:27.460 --> 33:29.460
She probably added that after this dick.

33:29.460 --> 33:31.460
But she responds, Robert,

33:31.460 --> 33:33.460
did you read my post in its entirety?

33:33.460 --> 33:35.460
Because I specifically noted

33:35.460 --> 33:37.460
that I am not going to use a shock collar.

33:37.460 --> 33:39.460
And then he responds,

33:39.460 --> 33:41.460
your little pooch needs to be

33:41.460 --> 33:43.460
socialized with other dogs and people.

33:43.460 --> 33:45.460
Look for a doggy and me class

33:45.460 --> 33:47.460
someplace like the Petco in Glendale.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.460
Oh, shit.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.460
And Jenna says,

33:51.460 --> 33:53.460
he has been and continues to be

33:53.460 --> 33:55.460
socialized with both people and dogs

33:55.460 --> 33:57.460
quite frequently actually.

33:57.460 --> 33:59.460
I'm not sure what that has to do

33:59.460 --> 34:01.460
with him barking when he is home alone

34:01.460 --> 34:03.460
as they don't correlate, but thank you

34:03.460 --> 34:05.460
for sharing your opinion and suggestion.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.460
And I'm like, okay, now team Jenna?

34:07.460 --> 34:09.460
Please tell me that these two

34:09.460 --> 34:11.460
end up fucking.

34:11.460 --> 34:13.460
At least they ended up killing each other.

34:13.460 --> 34:15.460
It's kind of a Sam and Diane

34:15.460 --> 34:17.460
kind of cheers situation going on.

34:17.460 --> 34:19.460
Then Marie

34:19.460 --> 34:21.460
interjects and goes, try some calming pills.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.460
You can

34:23.460 --> 34:25.460
Oh, Robert is not going to like this.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.460
You can go online.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.460
Petco has them.

34:31.460 --> 34:33.460
Wait, is she talking about the dog or her?

34:33.460 --> 34:35.460
Like

34:35.460 --> 34:37.460
she's saying take a chill pill bill

34:37.460 --> 34:39.460
before you end up in the hospital.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.460
When I am going to bout,

34:41.460 --> 34:43.460
I give them one a half hour

34:43.460 --> 34:45.460
before leaving. I also have pet zoom.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.460
It's so wick, pet trainer,

34:47.460 --> 34:49.460
hope this helps out.

34:49.460 --> 34:51.460
This is the relationship with pills as fast

34:51.460 --> 34:53.460
as it works.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.460
And then Angie responds

34:55.460 --> 34:57.460
to that going, I don't have a collar,

34:57.460 --> 34:59.460
but if open to it, you can try small doses

34:59.460 --> 35:01.460
of a natural anti-anxiety for pets.

35:01.460 --> 35:03.460
It's called rescue remedy and it works wonders

35:03.460 --> 35:05.460
for stressed out dogs. We use it on the 4th of July

35:05.460 --> 35:07.460
every year. Note, I'm not a vet.

35:07.460 --> 35:09.460
Please check with your vet first.

35:09.460 --> 35:11.460
And then Jenna.

35:11.460 --> 35:13.460
I'm on team Angie right now.

35:13.460 --> 35:15.460
Team Angie sounds like the most level headed.

35:15.460 --> 35:17.460
I don't know how comfortable these people are

35:17.460 --> 35:19.460
with dog pharmaceuticals.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.460
Jenna is like,

35:21.460 --> 35:23.460
yes, totally open to it.

35:23.460 --> 35:25.460
I'm familiar with it, but have not used it.

35:25.460 --> 35:27.460
Thinking about buying it, I used CBD oil

35:27.460 --> 35:29.460
in the beginning.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.460
First option. What the fuck is going on?

35:31.460 --> 35:33.460
Now I'm on Robert's.

35:33.460 --> 35:35.460
If that didn't work.

35:35.460 --> 35:37.460
The CBD dog treats, yeah, that's out there.

35:37.460 --> 35:39.460
Who was the first person that said

35:39.460 --> 35:41.460
just socialize your dog and take him for walks?

35:41.460 --> 35:43.460
That was Robert and he's gone.

35:43.460 --> 35:45.460
He actually suggested a doggy and me class

35:45.460 --> 35:47.460
at the Petco and Glendale.

35:47.460 --> 35:49.460
That was the specific prescription.

35:49.460 --> 35:51.460
And then he moved.

35:53.460 --> 35:55.460
Okay, one more.

35:55.460 --> 35:57.460
Give me a thousand more of these.

35:57.460 --> 35:59.460
This one is really, I don't know.

35:59.460 --> 36:01.460
Why do I have to tee it up?

36:01.460 --> 36:03.460
Need advice.

36:03.460 --> 36:05.460
Hello.

36:07.460 --> 36:09.460
Wait, wait, wait.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.460
Tell me the punctuation marks on this one.

36:11.460 --> 36:13.460
Hello, no punctuation,

36:13.460 --> 36:15.460
carriage return.

36:15.460 --> 36:17.460
And then just a single space paragraph.

36:17.460 --> 36:19.460
Look out.

36:19.460 --> 36:21.460
It's like a submarine commander.

36:21.460 --> 36:23.460
To whom?

36:23.460 --> 36:25.460
To whom?

36:25.460 --> 36:27.460
Our data shows you're in the Mariana's trench.

36:27.460 --> 36:29.460
Over.

36:29.460 --> 36:31.460
Hello.

36:31.460 --> 36:33.460
Hello.

36:33.460 --> 36:35.460
I need advice on what to do.

36:39.460 --> 36:41.460
Marrying it down.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.460
I believe that a neighbor

36:43.460 --> 36:45.460
is starving their dog.

36:45.460 --> 36:47.460
I offered to find her a home

36:47.460 --> 36:49.460
because they've told me that they don't want her.

36:49.460 --> 36:51.460
But when I did,

36:51.460 --> 36:53.460
they wanted a $750 re-homing fee

36:53.460 --> 36:55.460
to find her a good and loving home.

36:55.460 --> 36:57.460
What?

36:57.460 --> 36:59.460
When I said no and any would be better,

36:59.460 --> 37:01.460
their response was vulgar.

37:03.460 --> 37:05.460
I can PM a video of the dog.

37:07.460 --> 37:09.460
Well, that's like a ransom, right?

37:09.460 --> 37:11.460
I tried to piece.

37:11.460 --> 37:13.460
I'm so confused by this,

37:13.460 --> 37:15.460
but I think I figured it out.

37:15.460 --> 37:17.460
They're evil.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.460
They probably are starving a dog.

37:21.460 --> 37:23.460
She's a little crazy.

37:23.460 --> 37:25.460
Maybe that's an unfashionable word these days.

37:25.460 --> 37:27.460
She's on next door.

37:29.460 --> 37:31.460
It's crazy meets evil.

37:31.460 --> 37:33.460
She's observing a mistreated dog,

37:33.460 --> 37:35.460
an unhappy dog.

37:35.460 --> 37:37.460
She's going over to the door

37:37.460 --> 37:39.460
and she's like,

37:39.460 --> 37:41.460
hi, your dog seems miserable.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.460
Um, could I, uh,

37:43.460 --> 37:45.460
have it?

37:45.460 --> 37:47.460
And the person's response was like,

37:47.460 --> 37:49.460
uh, yeah, well, you're not wrong.

37:51.460 --> 37:53.460
And it's a two-way street.

37:53.460 --> 37:55.460
I don't even like the fucking thing.

37:55.460 --> 37:57.460
Uh, I'm thinking, uh,

37:57.460 --> 37:59.460
give me a fucking G.

37:59.460 --> 38:01.460
Give me a thousand bucks.

38:01.460 --> 38:03.460
What?

38:03.460 --> 38:05.460
I just want to find your dog a kind and loving home.

38:05.460 --> 38:07.460
Rehoming.

38:07.460 --> 38:09.460
I've never heard of that.

38:09.460 --> 38:11.460
I'm not going to give you $750.

38:11.460 --> 38:13.460
Well, then you could go suck a dick.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.460
Well, I'm going to suck a dick

38:17.460 --> 38:19.460
all the way to my phone.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.460
And, and, and get a ton of advice.

38:21.460 --> 38:23.460
Yes, what?

38:23.460 --> 38:25.460
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't.

38:25.460 --> 38:27.460
So that you could run a protection racket on your, on your dog.

38:27.460 --> 38:29.460
I mean, it's, I, I, I,

38:29.460 --> 38:31.460
like those, I mean, those people,

38:31.460 --> 38:33.460
there's no way that she's the bad guy, right?

38:33.460 --> 38:35.460
Because it's like, she's clearly like who,

38:35.460 --> 38:37.460
who would have that in her app?

38:37.460 --> 38:39.460
I mean, they're, we dealt with this in our neighborhood

38:39.460 --> 38:41.460
on our next door app,

38:41.460 --> 38:43.460
which is there is a dog who is kept

38:43.460 --> 38:45.460
in like a shed

38:45.460 --> 38:47.460
and doesn't appear to have like a light

38:47.460 --> 38:49.460
or water and like

38:49.460 --> 38:51.460
pause at the outside.

38:51.460 --> 38:53.460
I almost feel like there's one in every neighborhood

38:53.460 --> 38:55.460
that just people that don't like their culture

38:55.460 --> 38:57.460
is like junkyard dog.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.460
I think that's right.

38:59.460 --> 39:01.460
They're just like, well, that's a guard dog.

39:01.460 --> 39:03.460
Which means like we don't feed it

39:03.460 --> 39:05.460
because we want to keep it mean basically.

39:05.460 --> 39:07.460
And there's not

39:07.460 --> 39:09.460
a lot to do.

39:09.460 --> 39:11.460
You could certainly post on next door,

39:11.460 --> 39:13.460
but I think

39:13.460 --> 39:15.460
what your friend found is what

39:15.460 --> 39:17.460
it's going to be people saying call animal control,

39:17.460 --> 39:19.460
call animal control is going to say where you

39:19.460 --> 39:21.460
you're basically

39:21.460 --> 39:23.460
they're going to say suck a dick.

39:23.460 --> 39:25.460
Their response is ultimately vulgar

39:25.460 --> 39:27.460
because there's

39:27.460 --> 39:29.460
there's not much that you could do.

39:29.460 --> 39:31.460
So, yeah, yeah, that's okay.

39:31.460 --> 39:33.460
That's my next door app segment.

39:33.460 --> 39:35.460
Thanks for joining me on it.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.460
You must have had to avoid

39:37.460 --> 39:39.460
all the posts of people saying

39:39.460 --> 39:41.460
like a Latino guy looked at my house.

39:41.460 --> 39:43.460
Yeah, casing, casing.

39:43.460 --> 39:45.460
Is there a number that's more urgent

39:45.460 --> 39:47.460
than 911?

39:47.460 --> 39:49.460
I mean,

39:49.460 --> 39:51.460
if the guy with the wallet chain

39:51.460 --> 39:53.460
that yelled at the scooter, if he was brown,

39:53.460 --> 39:55.460
he would have been casing my house

39:55.460 --> 39:57.460
on next door app.

39:57.460 --> 39:59.460
I'm thinking around the neighborhood doing anything

39:59.460 --> 40:01.460
other than hauling in

40:01.460 --> 40:03.460
cartoon groceries with a baguette sticking out the top

40:03.460 --> 40:05.460
for that, you know,

40:05.460 --> 40:07.460
Caucasian supplies

40:07.460 --> 40:09.460
labeled on the bag.

40:09.460 --> 40:11.460
Uh,

40:11.460 --> 40:13.460
here's some here's pink and blue paint

40:13.460 --> 40:15.460
for the nursery and some baguettes.

40:15.460 --> 40:17.460
Um,

40:17.460 --> 40:19.460
I'm the first activist even King novel.

40:19.460 --> 40:21.460
Uh,

40:21.460 --> 40:23.460
everyone else is casing, casing, casing, casing.

40:23.460 --> 40:25.460
There's the top post on mine

40:25.460 --> 40:27.460
today is

40:27.460 --> 40:29.460
shady character.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.460
Yeah.

40:31.460 --> 40:33.460
It's just like there's a shady character.

40:33.460 --> 40:35.460
They should use something more tasteful

40:35.460 --> 40:37.460
like spooky or smoky.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.460
Can we cut my laugh on that?

40:47.460 --> 40:49.460
I got mad at you for a second,

40:49.460 --> 40:51.460
but I'm like, what reward for solidarity?

40:51.460 --> 40:53.460
Go on without me.

40:53.460 --> 40:55.460
Survive, survive my young man.

40:55.460 --> 40:57.460
Most people listening won't know which one

40:57.460 --> 40:59.460
that was.

40:59.460 --> 41:01.460
I think we're okay.

41:01.460 --> 41:03.460
Yeah, so Hollywood.

41:03.460 --> 41:05.460
Oh boy.

41:05.460 --> 41:07.460
You guys have this podcast, the Hollywood Handbook.

41:07.460 --> 41:09.460
I've been listening to a couple episodes.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.460
Your roster of guests is impressive.

41:11.460 --> 41:13.460
It's Ear Wolf, so, you know,

41:13.460 --> 41:15.460
you guys just hoard all of the

41:15.460 --> 41:17.460
guests.

41:17.460 --> 41:19.460
Yeah, I wish there were more stuff

41:19.460 --> 41:21.460
to say about our show.

41:21.460 --> 41:23.460
There isn't a ton.

41:23.460 --> 41:25.460
Thank you for everyone who clapped

41:25.460 --> 41:27.460
who

41:27.460 --> 41:29.460
said that they were here.

41:29.460 --> 41:31.460
We're aware of us.

41:31.460 --> 41:33.460
It's very funny.

41:33.460 --> 41:35.460
Thank you.

41:35.460 --> 41:37.460
Everyone who didn't,

41:37.460 --> 41:39.460
you can't just clap

41:39.460 --> 41:41.460
like,

41:41.460 --> 41:43.460
we can hear you.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.460
We're right back there.

41:45.460 --> 41:47.460
I'm holding that.

41:47.460 --> 41:49.460
What is the format of Hollywood Handbook?

41:49.460 --> 41:51.460
What do you say when people ask you

41:51.460 --> 41:53.460
what's the format of this show?

41:53.460 --> 41:55.460
It's pretty simple.

41:55.460 --> 41:57.460
Dan pours himself a hefty flag in the vodka.

41:59.460 --> 42:01.460
Hayes, I think,

42:01.460 --> 42:03.460
has characterized the show well.

42:03.460 --> 42:05.460
It is mostly funny comments.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.460
But the...

42:11.460 --> 42:13.460
Walk me through it, because I'm new to the game.

42:13.460 --> 42:15.460
You start a show and what...

42:15.460 --> 42:17.460
We...

42:17.460 --> 42:19.460
This will be good for anyone

42:19.460 --> 42:21.460
who wants to try to listen to one.

42:21.460 --> 42:23.460
We can give an example.

42:23.460 --> 42:25.460
Tim Heidecker was on the show recently.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.460
Thank you for listening to two episodes.

42:27.460 --> 42:29.460
He came on and told us that he did not

42:29.460 --> 42:31.460
get through the first ad,

42:31.460 --> 42:33.460
which was seven minutes long.

42:33.460 --> 42:35.460
So there are a couple barriers to entry.

42:35.460 --> 42:37.460
We've been told that the show takes

42:37.460 --> 42:39.460
15 to 20 episodes to get into.

42:39.460 --> 42:41.460
I think I said that.

42:41.460 --> 42:43.460
Someone said it's an acquired taste,

42:43.460 --> 42:45.460
which I was never gonna...

42:45.460 --> 42:47.460
It sounds like I'll get along with them.

42:47.460 --> 42:49.460
That's gotta be what people say

42:49.460 --> 42:51.460
about this podcast.

42:51.460 --> 42:53.460
Is there a game of an episode that we could...

42:53.460 --> 42:55.460
What's a good first...

42:55.460 --> 42:57.460
Orderve to enter into this world?

42:57.460 --> 42:59.460
You said you listened to the Heather Anne Campbell one.

42:59.460 --> 43:01.460
I think that one is pretty good.

43:01.460 --> 43:03.460
Heather's fucking fantastic.

43:03.460 --> 43:05.460
By the way, I acquired that taste instantly,

43:05.460 --> 43:07.460
which means it's not an acquired taste.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.460
You guys are very funny and charming.

43:11.460 --> 43:13.460
Spencer's a big fan and was on there.

43:13.460 --> 43:15.460
Spencer, come on.

43:15.460 --> 43:17.460
I tell people that it's kind of like

43:17.460 --> 43:19.460
people trying to improv.

43:19.460 --> 43:21.460
It's like an improv sketch, but the sketches,

43:21.460 --> 43:23.460
they're just having a conversation.

43:23.460 --> 43:25.460
The worst conversation.

43:25.460 --> 43:29.460
We're in character as two petty idiots.

43:29.460 --> 43:31.460
Which is like one degree off

43:31.460 --> 43:33.460
from our actual personalities.

43:33.460 --> 43:35.460
Have you guys ever listened to

43:35.460 --> 43:37.460
Peter Cook and Dudley Moore

43:37.460 --> 43:39.460
or Clive and Derek?

43:39.460 --> 43:41.460
No, I haven't.

43:41.460 --> 43:43.460
They are saying it's my inspiration.

43:43.460 --> 43:45.460
Yeah, they made these records

43:45.460 --> 43:47.460
where they just had studio time

43:47.460 --> 43:49.460
and they would just improvise

43:49.460 --> 43:51.460
and they made these records where it's just

43:51.460 --> 43:53.460
Dudley Moore and Peter Cook

43:53.460 --> 43:55.460
for me, the funniest improv of all time.

43:55.460 --> 43:57.460
But it's just two assholes

43:57.460 --> 43:59.460
talking as two fake characters

43:59.460 --> 44:01.460
named Derek and Clive.

44:01.460 --> 44:03.460
It's really funny.

44:03.460 --> 44:05.460
Since you brought...

44:05.460 --> 44:07.460
I wasn't sure everyone's got a different philosophy.

44:07.460 --> 44:09.460
I didn't know if I was allowed to say

44:09.460 --> 44:11.460
the characters...

44:11.460 --> 44:13.460
I don't know if you're like...

44:13.460 --> 44:15.460
You don't break that spell.

44:15.460 --> 44:17.460
No, we'd like a line drawn

44:17.460 --> 44:19.460
for the back catalog stuff.

44:19.460 --> 44:21.460
It kind of reminds me of...

44:21.460 --> 44:23.460
It's like a less arch

44:23.460 --> 44:25.460
Jiminy Glick.

44:25.460 --> 44:27.460
Like Martin Short doing Jiminy Glick.

44:27.460 --> 44:29.460
Yeah, absolutely.

44:29.460 --> 44:31.460
Yeah, we're not Martin Short.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.460
But...

44:33.460 --> 44:35.460
You guys are supposedly Hollywood insiders

44:35.460 --> 44:37.460
and you have guests on

44:37.460 --> 44:39.460
and the characters are clearly...

44:39.460 --> 44:41.460
Yeah, they don't know what they're talking about.

44:41.460 --> 44:43.460
So when Heather Anne Campbell,

44:43.460 --> 44:45.460
who's one of my favorite improv heroes,

44:45.460 --> 44:47.460
she came on...

44:47.460 --> 44:49.460
She's playing herself

44:49.460 --> 44:51.460
and so she took

44:51.460 --> 44:53.460
the strong choice to hate us

44:53.460 --> 44:55.460
for the entire episode.

44:55.460 --> 44:57.460
But we were asking her

44:57.460 --> 44:59.460
to do

44:59.460 --> 45:01.460
voiceover for a video game

45:01.460 --> 45:03.460
that we had designed.

45:03.460 --> 45:05.460
And so we're feeding her lines

45:05.460 --> 45:07.460
of what's happening in the game.

45:07.460 --> 45:09.460
It was a video game adaptation

45:09.460 --> 45:11.460
of the Ryan Reynolds Sandra Bullock film,

45:11.460 --> 45:13.460
The Proposal.

45:13.460 --> 45:15.460
But...

45:15.460 --> 45:17.460
I think you guys are really smart

45:17.460 --> 45:19.460
because it occurred to me then

45:19.460 --> 45:21.460
because I was like, why did they...

45:21.460 --> 45:23.460
Did they just have that up their sleeve?

45:23.460 --> 45:25.460
I mean, that's fine.

45:25.460 --> 45:27.460
Have that in your iCloud, as my ex-wife would call it.

45:27.460 --> 45:29.460
I have like five things I'm pulling out that week.

45:29.460 --> 45:31.460
But then I'm like, oh, no,

45:31.460 --> 45:33.460
it's because you asked her about video games.

45:33.460 --> 45:35.460
And she said it was popular. She said Fortnite.

45:35.460 --> 45:37.460
And you guys are like two weeks' notice.

45:37.460 --> 45:39.460
Have you seen The Proposal?

45:39.460 --> 45:41.460
I haven't.

45:41.460 --> 45:43.460
I have not seen it.

45:43.460 --> 45:45.460
I saw it.

45:45.460 --> 45:47.460
I remember the poster at Wilshire and Westwood,

45:47.460 --> 45:49.460
that giant billboard

45:49.460 --> 45:51.460
on the building there.

45:51.460 --> 45:53.460
That's all I know of The Proposal.

45:53.460 --> 45:55.460
I was kind of into it.

45:55.460 --> 45:57.460
I remember hearing it was okay and I knew

45:57.460 --> 45:59.460
the plot synopsis, which was helpful

45:59.460 --> 46:01.460
for the episode we did.

46:01.460 --> 46:03.460
We got guest-based or sometimes just you two?

46:03.460 --> 46:05.460
We do two episodes a week.

46:05.460 --> 46:07.460
One is

46:07.460 --> 46:09.460
an hour-long episode with a guest

46:09.460 --> 46:11.460
and one is a half-hour episode that's just the two of us

46:11.460 --> 46:13.460
exploring some kind of

46:13.460 --> 46:15.460
teaching you how to do something.

46:15.460 --> 46:17.460
And that one, for some reason, costs money.

46:17.460 --> 46:19.460
Yeah.

46:19.460 --> 46:21.460
The one without the guest is the one you have to pay

46:21.460 --> 46:23.460
for the subscription site.

46:23.460 --> 46:25.460
So not everybody, because that's the...

46:25.460 --> 46:27.460
Because if you've ever seen Jiminy Glick, Jeff,

46:27.460 --> 46:29.460
like Martin Shark doing the thing,

46:29.460 --> 46:31.460
because it's like, oh, if Tom Hanks does

46:31.460 --> 46:33.460
Jiminy Glick, is he playing a character?

46:33.460 --> 46:35.460
But it's like the answer is, well, you know,

46:35.460 --> 46:37.460
he's Tom Hanks and he's just reacting.

46:37.460 --> 46:39.460
The only thing he doesn't do is say,

46:39.460 --> 46:41.460
get that prosthetic chin off of your face,

46:41.460 --> 46:43.460
Martin Short. He pretends

46:43.460 --> 46:45.460
there's a real person asking these questions

46:45.460 --> 46:47.460
but then reacts kind of...

46:47.460 --> 46:49.460
What was Martin Short's line to Ben Stiller?

46:49.460 --> 46:51.460
Ben?

46:51.460 --> 46:53.460
Are you difficult?

46:53.460 --> 46:55.460
Are you moody?

46:55.460 --> 46:57.460
Are you moody, Ben Stiller?

46:57.460 --> 46:59.460
Are you moody, Ben Stiller?

46:59.460 --> 47:01.460
That's great.

47:01.460 --> 47:03.460
I think Martin Short...

47:03.460 --> 47:05.460
I think we asked

47:05.460 --> 47:07.460
after the idea of Martin Short being on

47:07.460 --> 47:09.460
here,

47:09.460 --> 47:11.460
I think he passed.

47:11.460 --> 47:13.460
Oh, that's why we're here today.

47:13.460 --> 47:15.460
Are you guys

47:15.460 --> 47:17.460
fans of Martin Short?

47:17.460 --> 47:19.460
Yeah.

47:19.460 --> 47:21.460
I was definitely a fan

47:21.460 --> 47:23.460
of Jiminy Glick. I thought it was so funny.

47:23.460 --> 47:25.460
The two things I think we compared

47:25.460 --> 47:27.460
our show to initially,

47:27.460 --> 47:29.460
when we'd get guests,

47:29.460 --> 47:31.460
was

47:31.460 --> 47:33.460
we did sometimes say

47:33.460 --> 47:35.460
Jiminy Glick and also Colbert Report.

47:35.460 --> 47:37.460
I had seen a video

47:37.460 --> 47:39.460
after we had started doing the show

47:39.460 --> 47:41.460
of Colbert meeting

47:41.460 --> 47:43.460
Obama or someone

47:43.460 --> 47:45.460
and being like, just so you know, here's the thing,

47:45.460 --> 47:47.460
when we get on camera, I'm a total idiot

47:47.460 --> 47:49.460
on the show and I'll be saying stupid shit

47:49.460 --> 47:51.460
and I was like, oh, that's cool.

47:51.460 --> 47:53.460
This is what we have to do to everyone.

47:53.460 --> 47:55.460
Hey, we're going to completely

47:55.460 --> 47:57.460
misunderstand everything you're saying

47:57.460 --> 47:59.460
and not really know your career

47:59.460 --> 48:01.460
and misquote things at you.

48:01.460 --> 48:03.460
But your guests are always people that are hip to that.

48:03.460 --> 48:05.460
Not always.

48:05.460 --> 48:07.460
There was famously one

48:07.460 --> 48:09.460
incident

48:09.460 --> 48:11.460
with Paulie Shore came.

48:11.460 --> 48:13.460
He was in kind of...

48:13.460 --> 48:15.460
Thank you so much.

48:15.460 --> 48:17.460
It was the lowest moment of my life.

48:17.460 --> 48:19.460
He was

48:19.460 --> 48:21.460
in kind of a hurry and as we start to be like,

48:21.460 --> 48:23.460
hey, just so you know, he's like, come on, let's just do it.

48:23.460 --> 48:25.460
Let's just go.

48:25.460 --> 48:27.460
Oh, no.

48:27.460 --> 48:29.460
We described it and he said, well, what if I hate that

48:29.460 --> 48:31.460
and I just walk out? Then what happens?

48:31.460 --> 48:33.460
And we were like, let's just record. Let's just go.

48:33.460 --> 48:35.460
Let's just go. Are you going?

48:35.460 --> 48:37.460
And then he immediately started giving us the wrap it up

48:37.460 --> 48:39.460
hand signal, like five minutes in.

48:39.460 --> 48:41.460
Oh, isn't it a five minute episode?

48:41.460 --> 48:43.460
Paulie is known for having

48:43.460 --> 48:45.460
so much great material.

48:45.460 --> 48:47.460
Yes.

48:47.460 --> 48:49.460
He

48:49.460 --> 48:51.460
is a terrible person.

48:51.460 --> 48:53.460
He called Sean a homo.

48:53.460 --> 48:55.460
He called me a homo on the show.

48:55.460 --> 48:57.460
No, he's not funny.

48:57.460 --> 48:59.460
But he probably broke the syllables up,

48:59.460 --> 49:01.460
so it was funny.

49:01.460 --> 49:03.460
He probably kicked you off.

49:03.460 --> 49:05.460
Yeah, that was actually a point of good judgment.

49:05.460 --> 49:07.460
I kept asking him about

49:07.460 --> 49:09.460
wheezing the jet ooze.

49:09.460 --> 49:11.460
And then I would say it like that

49:11.460 --> 49:13.460
and he'd go, well, no, it's you wheezing the jet.

49:13.460 --> 49:15.460
And I would go, right,

49:15.460 --> 49:17.460
you're wheezing the jet ooze.

49:17.460 --> 49:19.460
And he was like, don't say it like a fucking homo.

49:19.460 --> 49:21.460
And I was like, I'm sorry.

49:21.460 --> 49:23.460
I'm not like

49:23.460 --> 49:25.460
brave enough to be like, hey, we don't say that anymore.

49:25.460 --> 49:27.460
But I'm also

49:27.460 --> 49:29.460
I'm

49:29.460 --> 49:31.460
I'm like sort of doing the character.

49:31.460 --> 49:33.460
You're like, OK, I guess.

49:33.460 --> 49:35.460
Yeah, we bravely took it on in the next episode

49:35.460 --> 49:37.460
when he had not been

49:37.460 --> 49:39.460
at the studio for a week.

49:39.460 --> 49:41.460
Yeah, man, as I've been led to believe

49:41.460 --> 49:43.460
when if you leave the donuts out,

49:43.460 --> 49:45.460
he's going to glaze them.

49:45.460 --> 49:47.460
That's one of his fucking jokes.

49:47.460 --> 49:49.460
He's the worst comic of all time.

49:49.460 --> 49:51.460
Well, that's a job for it.

49:51.460 --> 49:53.460
That's probably one of his jokes from 25 years ago.

49:53.460 --> 49:55.460
All of his jokes.

49:55.460 --> 49:57.460
He's going to come on.

49:57.460 --> 49:59.460
Are donuts also a metaphor for something else?

49:59.460 --> 50:01.460
Yeah, that's kind of his premise.

50:01.460 --> 50:03.460
Oh, like if there's a girl in the room

50:03.460 --> 50:05.460
I'm going to come on it.

50:05.460 --> 50:07.460
Yeah, it doesn't age well, but

50:07.460 --> 50:09.460
If he's alone in the room with a woman.

50:09.460 --> 50:11.460
Did you used to be able to do that?

50:11.460 --> 50:13.460
Yeah, I mean,

50:13.460 --> 50:15.460
there's a movie called Revenge of the Nerds

50:15.460 --> 50:17.460
where the nerds are today's definition

50:17.460 --> 50:19.460
of rapists.

50:19.460 --> 50:21.460
Masked rapists.

50:21.460 --> 50:23.460
Yeah, everything was kind of

50:23.460 --> 50:25.460
inverted back then.

50:25.460 --> 50:27.460
If you

50:27.460 --> 50:29.460
if you

50:29.460 --> 50:31.460
if you if you smoked enough weed

50:31.460 --> 50:33.460
and

50:33.460 --> 50:35.460
danced enough, you could

50:35.460 --> 50:37.460
you could just

50:37.460 --> 50:39.460
dress up as Darth Vader and rape somebody.

50:39.460 --> 50:41.460
Advocate for all manner

50:41.460 --> 50:43.460
of assault as long as it whatever

50:43.460 --> 50:45.460
kept your ski mountain in business.

50:45.460 --> 50:47.460
Huh.

50:47.460 --> 50:49.460
All you had to do is declare yourself a misfit

50:49.460 --> 50:51.460
even though now these days we're like

50:51.460 --> 50:53.460
misfits. You guys

50:53.460 --> 50:55.460
look like the

50:55.460 --> 50:57.460
fucking rally the

50:57.460 --> 50:59.460
Unite the Right rally.

50:59.460 --> 51:01.460
Oh, like I need a little more

51:01.460 --> 51:03.460
diversity in my misfits.

51:03.460 --> 51:05.460
Remember

51:05.460 --> 51:07.460
misfits of science?

51:07.460 --> 51:09.460
No. 1980s

51:09.460 --> 51:11.460
series from the Golden

51:11.460 --> 51:13.460
Age of probably NBC, I'm assuming

51:13.460 --> 51:15.460
and probably six episodes

51:15.460 --> 51:17.460
and out. It was like

51:17.460 --> 51:19.460
this guy

51:19.460 --> 51:21.460
Courtney Cox was in it.

51:21.460 --> 51:23.460
She was like the Carrie

51:23.460 --> 51:25.460
psychic girl

51:25.460 --> 51:27.460
like she had psychic powers and then

51:27.460 --> 51:29.460
there was this I thought of that

51:29.460 --> 51:31.460
when I thought we need diversity with our misfits because

51:31.460 --> 51:33.460
one of their misfits was the basketball

51:33.460 --> 51:35.460
player who could shrink

51:35.460 --> 51:37.460
his clothes.

51:37.460 --> 51:39.460
It's funny because he's huge and then

51:39.460 --> 51:41.460
he would shrink and then he would have like a

51:41.460 --> 51:43.460
little like napkin around him because

51:43.460 --> 51:45.460
his clothes don't shrink.

51:45.460 --> 51:47.460
Right and then and then and then there was

51:47.460 --> 51:49.460
this dude who was like very Kevin Bacon anybody

51:49.460 --> 51:51.460
wasn't they clear they were clearly they were

51:51.460 --> 51:53.460
like can we get Kevin Bacon the answers no and

51:53.460 --> 51:55.460
then they got this guy and I'm sorry if that guy hears

51:55.460 --> 51:57.460
this and is like fuck you.

51:57.460 --> 51:59.460
But he was like his name was Johnny Lightning

51:59.460 --> 52:01.460
because he could shoot lightning on it.

52:01.460 --> 52:03.460
I think that guy is probably pretty happy to be hearing

52:03.460 --> 52:05.460
that guy's brought up.

52:05.460 --> 52:07.460
I would love to have that cast on.

52:07.460 --> 52:09.460
What made them of science?

52:09.460 --> 52:11.460
Yeah I'm not hearing a lot of science.

52:11.460 --> 52:13.460
It was all that like everything

52:13.460 --> 52:15.460
it's like the song

52:15.460 --> 52:17.460
weird science and the movie weird science

52:17.460 --> 52:19.460
it was sort of like we had that odd

52:19.460 --> 52:21.460
time in our cultural

52:21.460 --> 52:23.460
history when the computer was new

52:23.460 --> 52:25.460
and everything scientific

52:25.460 --> 52:27.460
was cool

52:27.460 --> 52:29.460
but it was also

52:29.460 --> 52:31.460
nerdy so it was like there were just a lot of

52:31.460 --> 52:33.460
TV shows and movies about like wow

52:33.460 --> 52:35.460
man science.

52:35.460 --> 52:37.460
She blinded me with science.

52:37.460 --> 52:39.460
Here's the science of getting laid.

52:39.460 --> 52:41.460
Like Scott Baio and Zapt

52:41.460 --> 52:43.460
like how am I going to make your bra

52:43.460 --> 52:45.460
pop off with my mind.

52:45.460 --> 52:47.460
I'm using science.

52:47.460 --> 52:49.460
Is this God?

52:49.460 --> 52:51.460
Hashtag rape culture.

52:51.460 --> 52:53.460
And they did missions or

52:53.460 --> 52:55.460
what are they they're fighting guys.

52:55.460 --> 52:57.460
The misfits yeah I don't I wish I could remember

52:57.460 --> 52:59.460
like how they justified that they had

52:59.460 --> 53:01.460
to go do stuff right.

53:01.460 --> 53:03.460
But it was kind of like very much X

53:03.460 --> 53:05.460
men because it was sort of like hey come on

53:05.460 --> 53:07.460
you guys are different like you can have a purpose though

53:07.460 --> 53:09.460
hang out with me it was like

53:09.460 --> 53:11.460
it was like the coach from White Shadow

53:11.460 --> 53:13.460
I was like this guy was like

53:13.460 --> 53:15.460
it was just like this guy

53:15.460 --> 53:17.460
back then you could be a leading

53:17.460 --> 53:19.460
man and just look like me there was

53:19.460 --> 53:21.460
just like there were so few men in the world

53:21.460 --> 53:23.460
the population

53:23.460 --> 53:25.460
was like one eighth that's that's

53:25.460 --> 53:27.460
if you're ever wondering when you look back

53:27.460 --> 53:29.460
after reruns and you're like why Elliot Gould

53:29.460 --> 53:31.460
like that's the answer is

53:31.460 --> 53:33.460
yeah like like like there was

53:33.460 --> 53:35.460
just no cloning yet.

53:35.460 --> 53:37.460
The guy I always look at is William Peterson

53:37.460 --> 53:39.460
who is great is in so

53:39.460 --> 53:41.460
many great movies he's like manhunter

53:41.460 --> 53:43.460
and to live in Diane LA

53:43.460 --> 53:45.460
and has the tightest curls

53:45.460 --> 53:47.460
just like this set of really tight

53:47.460 --> 53:49.460
curls that's either the is he

53:49.460 --> 53:51.460
manimal well no

53:51.460 --> 53:53.460
he was not manimal he's the guy who was CSI

53:53.460 --> 53:55.460
later okay like he was like

53:55.460 --> 53:57.460
the first CSI right that's his name

53:57.460 --> 53:59.460
yes William Peterson yeah

53:59.460 --> 54:01.460
have you seen manhunter?

54:01.460 --> 54:03.460
oh manhunter why did I heard manimal

54:03.460 --> 54:05.460
no no no

54:05.460 --> 54:07.460
he was not the manhunter he's the guy

54:07.460 --> 54:09.460
hunting the manhunter

54:09.460 --> 54:11.460
you mean the

54:11.460 --> 54:13.460
the Michael Mann movie

54:13.460 --> 54:15.460
with Tom Noonan

54:15.460 --> 54:17.460
and the Ray Fiennes

54:17.460 --> 54:19.460
role

54:19.460 --> 54:21.460
check out that movie if you haven't seen it

54:21.460 --> 54:23.460
it's like

54:23.460 --> 54:25.460
their adaptation of the red dragon

54:25.460 --> 54:27.460
book but from the 80s and it's kind of

54:27.460 --> 54:29.460
it's pretty cool it's all that's great

54:29.460 --> 54:31.460
Brian Cox's Hannibal Lecter

54:31.460 --> 54:33.460
it's incredible yeah I think it's like

54:33.460 --> 54:35.460
I mean I'm not gonna

54:35.460 --> 54:37.460
it's better than the Ed Norton

54:37.460 --> 54:39.460
I enjoyed both of them but like

54:39.460 --> 54:41.460
I'll do it for you

54:41.460 --> 54:43.460
it's better than the Ed Norton one

54:43.460 --> 54:45.460
I feel like it's more

54:45.460 --> 54:47.460
it somehow did a better job

54:47.460 --> 54:49.460
of like driving home that idea

54:49.460 --> 54:51.460
of like

54:51.460 --> 54:53.460
the protagonist

54:53.460 --> 54:55.460
he can catch these guys because he's

54:55.460 --> 54:57.460
he's got a screw loose

54:57.460 --> 54:59.460
like he's like

54:59.460 --> 55:01.460
well he's living there like he climbs the train

55:01.460 --> 55:03.460
he finds the little king of our rappers

55:03.460 --> 55:05.460
and he's like living that guy's whole day

55:05.460 --> 55:07.460
going like oh I know exactly how you did the crime

55:07.460 --> 55:09.460
it's pretty good yeah and red dragon

55:09.460 --> 55:11.460
the Ray Fiennes thing kind of like

55:11.460 --> 55:13.460
it was more like you know

55:13.460 --> 55:15.460
Ed Norton was there holding down the

55:15.460 --> 55:17.460
the boat that's an expression don't look it up

55:17.460 --> 55:19.460
they

55:19.460 --> 55:21.460
but like they knew

55:21.460 --> 55:23.460
they're like they probably watched the

55:23.460 --> 55:25.460
I think they probably watched the Michael Mann one

55:25.460 --> 55:27.460
and they're like Tom Noonan's a superstar

55:27.460 --> 55:29.460
in this movie who do we

55:29.460 --> 55:31.460
cast as the Tooth Fairy

55:31.460 --> 55:33.460
okay we got Ray Fiennes like this movie's about this guy

55:33.460 --> 55:35.460
you know it's not really

55:35.460 --> 55:37.460
the hero really isn't

55:37.460 --> 55:39.460
the cop who gets in your head

55:39.460 --> 55:41.460
and the third act in both movies

55:41.460 --> 55:43.460
it's like the resolution is

55:43.460 --> 55:45.460
hey I know enough about you to shame you

55:45.460 --> 55:47.460
about your pissing your pants

55:47.460 --> 55:49.460
like that's how I'll get you to relax

55:49.460 --> 55:51.460
enough to kill you yeah so it's actually

55:51.460 --> 55:53.460
like kind of more apt to

55:53.460 --> 55:55.460
but manhunter if I'm not mistaken

55:55.460 --> 55:57.460
has like a weird scene where Tom Noonan

55:57.460 --> 55:59.460
like hugs a tiger that's been

55:59.460 --> 56:01.460
he does oh my god no I'm like

56:01.460 --> 56:03.460
that alone you gotta watch

56:03.460 --> 56:05.460
well in both movies and like the love

56:05.460 --> 56:07.460
theme of the movie plays like this incredible

56:07.460 --> 56:09.460
music yeah well in which

56:09.460 --> 56:11.460
movie is it where they actually show her

56:11.460 --> 56:13.460
because I've read the book too where it describes her

56:13.460 --> 56:15.460
cupping the tiger's testicles

56:15.460 --> 56:17.460
okay it's the blind woman

56:17.460 --> 56:19.460
yeah he brings a blind woman to feel

56:19.460 --> 56:21.460
a tiger that's been sedated

56:21.460 --> 56:23.460
which I think it's

56:23.460 --> 56:25.460
it's cool

56:25.460 --> 56:27.460
I've never thought about it at a zoo ever since

56:27.460 --> 56:29.460
every time I see a big animal I'm like at some point

56:29.460 --> 56:31.460
in this animal's life

56:31.460 --> 56:33.460
they get sedated

56:33.460 --> 56:35.460
and then the people in the zoo go

56:35.460 --> 56:37.460
and like snuggle yeah

56:37.460 --> 56:39.460
I just think it's so interesting that he has

56:39.460 --> 56:41.460
the empathy to understand

56:41.460 --> 56:43.460
that as a blind woman she might be

56:43.460 --> 56:45.460
into that

56:45.460 --> 56:47.460
and that also as a blind woman she's like

56:47.460 --> 56:49.460
first and last tiger I'm ever gonna touch

56:49.460 --> 56:51.460
let's check out these nuts

56:51.460 --> 56:53.460
I mean it makes you

56:53.460 --> 56:55.460
love her it makes you love him

56:55.460 --> 56:57.460
it makes you love him

56:57.460 --> 56:59.460
because the tiger's like the tiger by the way

56:59.460 --> 57:01.460
they state it's like oh he's got a bad tooth

57:01.460 --> 57:03.460
they're gonna fix his tooth but the tiger's

57:03.460 --> 57:05.460
like I like do I have any

57:05.460 --> 57:07.460
agency like

57:07.460 --> 57:09.460
I don't get I didn't even sign up

57:09.460 --> 57:11.460
to be in a zoo but but having

57:11.460 --> 57:13.460
do they get the tiger like a camera shot

57:13.460 --> 57:15.460
or does a camera take while she's filling

57:15.460 --> 57:17.460
the nuts like

57:17.460 --> 57:19.460
it's a living

57:19.460 --> 57:21.460
but which movie is it

57:21.460 --> 57:23.460
in manhunter do they do the

57:23.460 --> 57:25.460
I think it's Red Dragon where they really are more

57:25.460 --> 57:27.460
faithful to the book where they show a close-up

57:27.460 --> 57:29.460
of her hand kind of cup the

57:29.460 --> 57:31.460
fur clad nut sack

57:31.460 --> 57:33.460
of this tiger and then they cut

57:33.460 --> 57:35.460
to Ray Fiennes going

57:35.460 --> 57:37.460
like he's kind of like

57:37.460 --> 57:39.460
vicarious

57:39.460 --> 57:41.460
what's that caressing

57:41.460 --> 57:43.460
I want that

57:43.460 --> 57:45.460
blind hand on my scrotum

57:45.460 --> 57:47.460
it's enough

57:47.460 --> 57:49.460
to make you not want to eat

57:49.460 --> 57:51.460
people

57:51.460 --> 57:53.460
wait that's Hannibal

57:53.460 --> 57:55.460
it's enough to make you not want to get a tattoo

57:55.460 --> 57:57.460
of a painting across your entire back and super glue

57:57.460 --> 57:59.460
Philip Seymour Hoffman to a wheelchair

57:59.460 --> 58:01.460
that's right

58:01.460 --> 58:03.460
it's a good movie

58:03.460 --> 58:05.460
both movies are good

58:05.460 --> 58:07.460
speaking also of when you

58:07.460 --> 58:09.460
talk about unlikely leading men

58:09.460 --> 58:11.460
I did watch a movie from the

58:11.460 --> 58:13.460
70's not that long ago and

58:13.460 --> 58:15.460
Robert Duvall

58:15.460 --> 58:17.460
is the lead

58:17.460 --> 58:19.460
and he always looked like he looked

58:19.460 --> 58:21.460
he's like

58:21.460 --> 58:23.460
he's always been 55 years old

58:23.460 --> 58:25.460
he's like a heavy set ball dude

58:25.460 --> 58:27.460
who's just like hey sweetie

58:27.460 --> 58:29.460
what the fuck is he doing

58:29.460 --> 58:31.460
it's the center of the film

58:31.460 --> 58:33.460
there's like black and white movies with Robert Duvall

58:33.460 --> 58:35.460
just like picking up his daughter from college

58:35.460 --> 58:37.460
how far back do we have to go

58:37.460 --> 58:39.460
what film is it with Robert Duvall

58:39.460 --> 58:41.460
I was watching the outfit

58:41.460 --> 58:43.460
and it's like

58:43.460 --> 58:45.460
who saw this guy and was like

58:45.460 --> 58:47.460
this is like the baddest dude

58:47.460 --> 58:49.460
alpha male

58:49.460 --> 58:51.460
like mr. cool

58:51.460 --> 58:53.460
but he's always like

58:53.460 --> 58:55.460
he's a New Yorker even like in true grit

58:55.460 --> 58:57.460
he's like rooster

58:57.460 --> 58:59.460
I got the girl up in rooster

58:59.460 --> 59:01.460
I'm shut the pieces you son of a bitch

59:01.460 --> 59:03.460
why is there a New York Jew

59:03.460 --> 59:05.460
fighting John Wayne

59:05.460 --> 59:07.460
at the end of true grit

59:07.460 --> 59:09.460
he's fucking great

59:09.460 --> 59:11.460
we got a big titted hit

59:11.460 --> 59:13.460
you see the Charlie Varick

59:13.460 --> 59:15.460
oh no that's fucking him up

59:15.460 --> 59:17.460
yeah Walter Matthow

59:17.460 --> 59:19.460
he also looked always like he looked

59:19.460 --> 59:21.460
his jowls or like clack allys

59:21.460 --> 59:23.460
see Charlie Varick

59:23.460 --> 59:25.460
the women are like oh Charlie

59:25.460 --> 59:27.460
come here you

59:27.460 --> 59:29.460
people were just 40 back then

59:29.460 --> 59:31.460
Walter Matthow is the least sexy actor

59:31.460 --> 59:33.460
like he makes Elliott Gould look like

59:33.460 --> 59:35.460
fucking Paul Newman

59:35.460 --> 59:37.460
and Walter Matthow

59:37.460 --> 59:39.460
fucks up model

59:39.460 --> 59:41.460
for no reason

59:41.460 --> 59:43.460
and not that into it

59:43.460 --> 59:45.460
Charlie Varick at the end there is a

59:45.460 --> 59:47.460
car chase or it's a car and an airplane

59:47.460 --> 59:49.460
and the car is chasing an airplane

59:49.460 --> 59:51.460
like taxing around the end of an airport

59:51.460 --> 59:53.460
it's fucking good

59:53.460 --> 59:55.460
but like why is

59:55.460 --> 59:57.460
Walter Matthow getting laid

59:57.460 --> 59:59.460
because he's not sexy

59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.460
it was always like

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.460
it's a wonder why

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:05.460
oh that's why we respected our dad so much

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:07.460
because you watch movies

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.460
you're like well this movie is about how

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.460
robots are cool but there's that guy

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.460
that looks like my dad and he's

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.460
crushing all the pus

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.460
Stacey Keech

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.460
like everyone was your dad

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.460
Stacey Keech

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.460
watch your mouth out

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.460
Halloween 3 season of the witch

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.460
I can't remember that guy's name but

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.460
Viv and I were just talking about this

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.460
like we were just laughing about how it was like

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.460
god yeah the 80's it was like when your dad

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.460
was the star of every movie and like

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.460
Halloween 3 is not Michael Myers

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.460
like related it's like

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.460
this crazy movie about these like

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.460
science

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.460
masks that have science in them

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.460
and summon a Celtic spell

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.460
that makes snakes come out of kids mouths

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:51.460
and there's just this guy

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.460
it's just like the kind

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.460
of guy where you look at him and you can

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.460
smell their socks

01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.460
like you know

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.460
because it's your dad

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.460
maybe when I say your dad it's like you guys are like

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.460
no my dad is like

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.460
your dad's name is Kayle

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:09.460
and like

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.460
was in the Peace Corps

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.460
my generation's dad

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.460
was just Stacey Keech

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.460
it was just like

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.460
showered every six days

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.460
had a broom mustache

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.460
and just drank

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.460
that and

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:27.460
if you're in a movie

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:29.460
then the law says

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.460
you're fucking the woman in the movie

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.460
and like it doesn't matter if she's 19

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.460
and you're 48

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:37.460
there's just no questions asked

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.460
as long as it's not an interracial

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.460
Charlie Ferrick is a great film but

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.460
that weird sex scene is like no

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:45.460
there's no way she fucks fucking Walter Mouth

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.460
there's no reason for it

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.460
they just had to throw that awful scene

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.460
into that film

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.460
see like Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.460
and then just go home and look at their awful dad

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:57.460
oh god

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.460
yeah is it any wonder that we're like eating ourselves alive

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.460
like you can't have those bodies

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.460
you have to

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.460
how do you get those bodies

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.460
we stopped counting

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.460
six packs like that was like

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.460
oh I get it you have to have a six pack

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.460
and then they're like fuck you we're not gonna count packs anymore

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.460
from now on

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.460
your torso has to

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.460
look like Groot even without

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.460
CG it just has to be made out of

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.460
fucking driftwood by

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.460
a horny god

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.460
and they've taken the normal guys

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:29.460
they took

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.460
Chris Pratt and like Zach Levi

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.460
who were just like slobs

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:35.460
cast to play normal guys

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.460
and made them

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.460
so all right what's up Chris Pratt's

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.460
like guardian's body

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.460
everyone was like that's CG

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.460
that's not asking me if it was

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.460
you came to the right place

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.460
you came to the right place

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.460
I want bad news

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.460
Ombré

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.460
you worked for Pixar

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.460
when they did that

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.460
no no no man

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.460
you're all flesh and bone

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.460
why is this

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.460
germane to you you're like

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.460
I'm his dog sitter

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:09.460
I was one time

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.460
walking into a restaurant as he was walking out

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.460
I never believed before I checked

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.460
yeah I was like that's a silly amount of shame

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:17.460
for us to be projecting

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.460
I remember I saw Chris Pratt

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:21.460
in the flesh at the up front

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:23.460
during Parks and Rec and Community

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.460
times and I was like it's amazing

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.460
that at one time I did

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.460
look at him as someone that

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.460
maybe would play me in the biopic

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:35.460
because

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.460
he looked like he was shaped

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.460
like a bowling pin

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.460
who are we looking at now

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.460
who do we sort of have our eye

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:45.460
it's of course Donal Logue

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.460
he's playing me right now

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.460
on the set of my fiance's

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.460
show but honestly

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.460
the real answer is Ewan McGregor

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:55.460
obviously if you look long enough

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.460
you'll see it

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.460
people are like Russell Crowe

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.460
but I'm like whatever man

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.460
you're just trying to

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.460
Ewan McGregor

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.460
I would go Ron Perlman for you

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.460
he's just taking it in

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.460
just give him a second

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.460
to just process it

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:15.460
a single tears rolling down

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.460
his cheek

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.460
there was some kind of thing

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.460
when Donal Logue got cast

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.460
like

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.460
man the conversations I had to listen to

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.460
I was like but maybe

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:29.460
Jeff Goldblum's 90

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.460
it's like yeah but

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.460
and all these things and then like

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.460
and then finally they got

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.460
Donal Logue and then

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.460
apparently his name is not Donal

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.460
it's Donal

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.460
and also apparently Cody says we have to have him on the show

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.460
because he's like amazing and really fun

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:47.460
but

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.460
it got back

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.460
to me that

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.460
when he got approached for the part

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.460
he

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.460
Googled me and then asked his agent

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.460
who then asked the producer

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.460
who asked Cody who repeated this to me

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.460
because I guess she perceives me

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.460
as a maid of tougher stuff

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.460
I guess I've successfully tricked her

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.460
into thinking that I am

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:17.460
somehow self-actualized

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:19.460
I guess

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.460
by being on top of someone

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.460
perfect and not

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.460
constantly opting out

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.460
I guess she's like this guy's got balls of steel

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.460
but

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.460
he got the offer and then he Googled me

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.460
and then his question was like

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:37.460
this isn't about body type is it

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:39.460
it was like

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:41.460
oh no

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.460
wait

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.460
he preceded insults to him

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:47.460
yeah

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:49.460
or he wanted people to know he'd lost weight

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.460
I don't know man

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:53.460
it shouldn't have gotten back to me that's the only truth

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.460
here

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.460
he didn't want me to hear that

01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.460
it's like the episode

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.460
you're playing me

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.460
you'll be playing the part of

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.460
what the fuck man

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.460
that doesn't

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.460
happen to Winston Churchill

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:11.460
it doesn't

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.460
hear that people were like what do I put on a suit

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:15.460
and also

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:17.460
if he Googles Dan Harmon

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.460
body and image searches it

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:21.460
he's probably getting more results

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:23.460
than he would anticipate

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:25.460
well to be fair if you start typing

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:29.460
my name it bodies the first thing that comes up

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.460
it's feet

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.460
um

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.460
and then a slew of stuff that

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:37.460
anyways

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.460
alright well what else here we got here

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:41.460
Hollywood

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.460
yes Hollywood baby

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:45.460
so

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.460
can we try a Hollywood thing or is that a weird thing

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.460
to have a voice upon us

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:51.460
what does that mean

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.460
can we do

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:55.460
we don't do anything

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.460
they've been trying to tell you

01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.460
they don't do anything

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:01.460
when we first started

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.460
we had much more of a premise

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.460
to the podcast which it was

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:07.460
kind of a parody

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.460
of all these shows about

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.460
becoming successful in Hollywood

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.460
like WTF was like the biggest

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.460
show at the time

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.460
every episode was like when did you first realize

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:19.460
you were funny and so we were like

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:21.460
doing a parody of those types

01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:23.460
of interviews that were like

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:25.460
at the time 85% of podcasts

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.460
yes

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.460
Marc Maron called me a genius

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.460
dude

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.460
he's not far

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.460
off

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:39.460
he's not far

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.460
off

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.460
he's all around it

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:47.460
I haven't listened to that episode

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:49.460
who were your guys

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.460
who were my guys

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.460
he asks everyone

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.460
the tough crowd crew

01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.460
Colin Quinn

01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:59.460
Nicky DePaul

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:05.460
but we sort of ran out of stuff

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.460
to do with that and stopped being interested

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.460
in it and podcast

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.460
became more broad too

01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.460
so it wasn't as clear of like a one to one

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:15.460
thing and then

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.460
the show became like more abstract

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.460
I guess and also

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.460
we started taking

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.460
on much smaller targets

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.460
like other shows

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.460
we were jealous of specifically for being

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.460
more popular like we would invite someone on

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.460
and we would do their podcast to them

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.460
and tell them we were

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.460
doing it better like we had Paula Topkis on

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.460
and we were like how about we Spontaneonation

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.460
you and then we just

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.460
made him sit through our version of his

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.460
podcast basically Paula Topkis

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.460
doesn't follow me on Instagram so I no longer

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:47.460
follow him

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.460
take me through the moment when we realize

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.460
that we're like it was fucking rough

01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.460
because I was gonna like for the 90th time

01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.460
in my Paul F. Tompkins please like

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.460
me career I was about

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.460
to comment on one of his Instagrams

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.460
just a totally safe fucking

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.460
like here's a bowl of fruit for the

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:09.460
Hawaiian Easter Island fucking

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.460
God that I perceive you as

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:13.460
just like

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:15.460
just reminding you I exist and I'm in your corner

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.460
and then I was like you know you see

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:19.460
that message that's like

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.460
there's some guidelines here

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.460
you know like where it's like

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.460
excuse me sir

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.460
this user has

01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:29.460
put up some fucking boundaries

01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:31.460
you know like

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.460
basically

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.460
I think I did the same thing

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.460
where you have to follow me in order

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.460
to comment but wait no that doesn't make

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.460
sense sometimes I think he disables comments

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.460
I

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:45.460
it's something like

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.460
well whatever it is he froze me out and

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.460
I don't care anymore because I need to

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:51.460
it's not about him

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.460
I need to find my

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.460
right before I got here

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.460
I need to find my self-esteem and that's

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.460
nobody's problem with mine it's

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:01.460
you know it's like he's probably

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.460
smelling the desperation on me and like

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:05.460
I

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:07.460
maybe

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.460
he and Marc Maron have a bit of a frosty past

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:11.460
he hears him call you a genius

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:13.460
yeah

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.460
and that hurts his ego

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.460
choose right now

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.460
can we get word

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.460
to Paul F. Topkins that I'm positive

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:23.460
Marc Maron hates me now as well

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.460
just because like how would you

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.460
not

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.460
flow

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.460
it's because I think like we have

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.460
that'll get Paul on board

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.460
do you have Paul's number on your phone

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:37.460
do you have Paul's number on your phone

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:39.460
you gotta call

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.460
no stop it

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.460
you crossed the line and you're embarrassing me

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:45.460
because this is a for real thing that I'm pretending

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:47.460
as a joke and it's for real and you're embarrassing me

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.460
can I tell you I'm sure

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:51.460
he didn't but I think that

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.460
Paul F. Tomkins subtweeted me because I think

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.460
he follows me on Twitter and he was like

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.460
I think

01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:59.460
listen to this guy

01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:01.460
so when you follow

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.460
someone you can see their

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.460
icon appear more often on your reactions

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.460
and mentions and stuff and he was like

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.460
there's some people that follow me

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.460
that never interact with any of my posts

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.460
and only like

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:15.460
posts responding to me and I'm like

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.460
I've done that like more than

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.460
200 times and so

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:21.460
I was certain because like sometimes he just gets

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.460
into it with people and the people have really funny things

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.460
to say and they go on these long threads and I'm like

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:27.460
like that like that like that but like he kicks

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.460
it off but it's not like he's not making

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.460
those jokes he's just making his jokes and so I

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.460
don't know but but I definitely

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:35.460
am pretty sure that was just straight up

01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:37.460
me he was talking to

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.460
this is him

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.460
that actually and he

01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.460
of course was just an example of

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.460
a person we'd done a podcast with

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.460
and didn't need to be

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.460
like a subject of an entire

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:51.460
because like for example he told us to

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.460
like antagonize you on the show

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.460
I mean no he would have to care

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.460
that would be flattering

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.460
I

01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.460
I would be amazing

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:05.460
if he was like

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.460
that's what I want

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.460
we're ribbing each other

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:15.460
why don't you reach out to him and bring him on the show

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.460
because the whole point

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:19.460
we brought him on the show before

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.460
it's like there's nothing I can do

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.460
I've done that

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.460
part of what he doesn't like

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:27.460
about me if I may be

01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:29.460
so

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.460
assumptive if that's a word

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.460
is that is this what I'm doing right now

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.460
he doesn't want anywhere near this kind

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.460
of relationship with like I know

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.460
I know how he feels

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:41.460
this guy that I'm doing right now

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:43.460
it's like what is that person

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.460
saying other than like a million red flags

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:47.460
about like like oh

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.460
come be part of my

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:51.460
my fucking sticky

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:53.460
negative energy fucking like

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:55.460
tell me you like me because

01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:57.460
that's how I know I like myself like

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:59.460
no grow up

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.460
and be cool like Scott Ackerman

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.460
and all of my earwolf friends

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.460
and then

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.460
maybe one day I'll come around

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:09.460
when you're so fucking cool

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:11.460
you know the day that you stop

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.460
wanting it then I'll be like hey kid

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:15.460
and then I'll look

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:17.460
and you'll throw me your jersey like

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.460
like means

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:21.460
means you're green and a coca-cola ad

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:23.460
kid wanted the jersey really bad

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.460
in that

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:27.460
I think that's victim blaming now

01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.460
that's it

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:35.460
did the Pepsi

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.460
Michael Jackson ad rip off the

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.460
coke mean Joe Green thing

01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.460
when Michael Jackson throws the hat

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.460
to the kid that he ends up raping for 30 years

01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:49.460
Michael Jackson has the right response

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:51.460
a fucking deal

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.460
some people are upset I think

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:55.460
because they think Michael Jackson was innocent

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:57.460
I think that's what the people in the crowd

01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:59.460
are saying I agree with you I think he's guilty

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.460
I'm not taking a position either way

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:03.460
but we should talk about it for a while

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.460
just as a fan of

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:09.460
positive reactions

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:11.460
yeah come on I like to just

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.460
collect positive reactions

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.460
let's talk about him

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.460
let's move on to Attorney General William

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:19.460
Barr let's talk about that

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:21.460
he fucks so many children

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.460
he's fucking the children

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.460
of the Constitution

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.460
fun time to be alive

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.460
let's talk about Hollywood

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.460
do you guys feel bad for Liam Neeson

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.460
okay this is great

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:45.460
I have two incredibly unpopular

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.460
opinions

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:49.460
I never clicked on any

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:51.460
but just hearing the

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:53.460
story of what happened

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.460
I feel bad for

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:57.460
okay I thought you were talking about something else

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.460
go on

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.460
his wife passed

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.460
his wife passed

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.460
we definitely did feel bad about that

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:07.460
that one was easy

01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.460
wait that happened recently

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:11.460
not thorny at all years ago

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.460
but Hayes can't escape it

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:15.460
that's like one of his movies

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:17.460
wait it's Liam Neeson

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:19.460
Liam Neeson in the news

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:21.460
no no no

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.460
it was a thing

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:25.460
look he was doing

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:27.460
some morning show or something I didn't click on it

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:29.460
I didn't see what the thing was

01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:31.460
so I have to admit that I didn't click on it

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.460
so I only saw the headlines

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:35.460
but I was like wait this doesn't make sense

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:37.460
in the flow chart of how it should work

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:39.460
that he was doing like

01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:41.460
I'm gonna call it a Dan Harmon kind of thing

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:43.460
where he was like

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.460
I'm so excited about how

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:47.460
fucking improved I am

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.460
and how much I want people to like me

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:51.460
I'm gonna tell you that I was racist 40 years ago

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.460
and

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:55.460
unless you think I'm just throwing that term out

01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:57.460
no for real like I wanted to murder

01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.460
any black person at all

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:01.460
like I was in this situation

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.460
you know I kind of like just told the story about how this

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.460
like 40 years ago and then it was like

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.460
well

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:09.460
then thanks for telling us that

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.460
because now we can hate you

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:13.460
as opposed to like the rules that used to be

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.460
where it was like well thanks for telling us that

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.460
because we wouldn't have known otherwise

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:19.460
therefore we need to encourage that kind of transparency

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:21.460
so here's a

01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.460
metal not really but

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.460
can I ask you something though

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.460
so you have this opinion

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:29.460
it's a very unpopular opinion

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.460
and yet

01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:33.460
you still haven't clicked on it

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:35.460
and I'll point this out

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.460
this wasn't like

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:39.460
that recently

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:41.460
you have had time

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:43.460
I keep thinking about it

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:45.460
well I've been compiling a list of unpopular opinions

01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.460
one is that I think the blues brothers movie

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.460
is overrated

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.460
yeah I gotta agree with you there

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:53.460
they're singing and stuff

01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:55.460
is this funny

01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:57.460
I don't understand

01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.460
you cannot crack up when you hear

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.460
the iconic line

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:03.460
we're on a mission from god

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:05.460
I

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.460
kind of the laugh that got

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.460
this place is fucking burning down

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.460
but then

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.460
Aretha Franklin comes out and says

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.460
you better think it was pretty fucking good

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.460
like there's good music moments in it

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.460
it might be

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.460
it was probably a blast to me

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.460
why do we need these guys

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.460
I think it's high time that

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:27.460
five white guys weighed in on jazz music

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:29.460
and saw

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:31.460
okay but can we weigh in on two other white guys doing it

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.460
yeah

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:35.460
the high road is a medium road

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.460
the blues brothers are jazz music to you

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:39.460
they're off limits now the blues brothers

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.460
for me you got

01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:43.460
fucking Ray Charles and you got Aretha

01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:45.460
that's pretty groovy

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.460
I think that it probably was a movie that when everyone saw it

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:49.460
it was like wow this must have been so fun

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:51.460
to be a part of

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.460
and it felt like it was cool on set

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.460
or something and then it gets remembered as

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:57.460
what a great movie but if you just sit down

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:59.460
and watch the movie for what the movie is

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:01.460
it's not that funny

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:03.460
yeah okay thank you

01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:05.460
and even less explicable

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:07.460
is the sketch

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:09.460
on SNL

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:11.460
it was all about that

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:13.460
I mean I understand

01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:15.460
like I feel like I feel insulted

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:17.460
by people's responses because their responses

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.460
are always to explain to me

01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:21.460
as if

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:23.460
I don't understand that

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:25.460
it was possible that there was a time

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:27.460
when

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:29.460
people felt this way or that way

01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.460
you're not

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:33.460
comedy you're not telling

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:35.460
I do understand that

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.460
I read the oral history of Saturday Night Live

01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:39.460
I do understand and I think it's really cool

01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:41.460
I read the headline

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.460
that John Belushi

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.460
who looks nothing like

01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:47.460
any fucking leading man

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.460
before there even was a fat dude market

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.460
I mean there wasn't even that

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.460
and he looks like John Belushi

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:55.460
and this variety show

01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:57.460
at midnight on Saturday produced by

01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:59.460
this crazy hippie

01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:01.460
and all these second city people

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.460
and it's this fucking awesome

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:05.460
and Dan Aykraid's got the ass burgers

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:07.460
and they don't have a word for it yet

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:09.460
and he and Belushi had this

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:11.460
intersection where they both love old blues music

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.460
and Pharrell loved it

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.460
and didn't punch down on it

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.460
we're super into it and that America

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:19.460
was like yeah comedy

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:21.460
is so possible to also be

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.460
sexy and fun and subversive

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.460
that I choose to love this

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.460
that's part of the joke

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:29.460
I get all that

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:31.460
but then there's this

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:33.460
separate issue of like

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:35.460
now let me propose an alternative

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.460
watch the movie Airplane

01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.460
by the Zucker Brothers

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.460
I mean Jesus Christ

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.460
there's a lot of fucking jokes in that movie

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:45.460
40% of them are now racist

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:47.460
but they all still register

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.460
as jokes

01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:51.460
yeah it's like okay set up punchline

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:53.460
and you can kind of like

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.460
I just kind of

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:57.460
part of me that resents

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.460
Liam Neeson loves that movie

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.460
I have to tell you

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:03.460
there's a guy I used to love the blues brothers

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:07.460
I loved it so much

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:09.460
I saw the movie

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:11.460
and I just wanted to beat a minority to death

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.460
I'm just putting that out there

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.460
I hope honesty is still the best policy

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:21.460
Dan Harmon told me it was

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.460
well I got news for you

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.460
old timer

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:27.460
you're going to the Husqow

01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:29.460
wait no I have a particular set of skills

01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:31.460
hey did you guys see Cold Pursuit

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.460
I haven't seen it

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:35.460
it's worth watching

01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:37.460
I watch it with Cody

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:39.460
your money doesn't go to racism

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.460
like

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.460
it's interesting

01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:45.460
it's a weird

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:47.460
Dan Harmon raves

01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.460
it's worth watching

01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:51.460
I mean that is my rave these days

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.460
yeah for sure

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.460
I was speaking of blues and brothers

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:57.460
I was at the fucking drawing room

01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:59.460
on a karaoke last Sunday

01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.460
and a dude

01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.460
I saw him sitting in the booth

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:05.460
and he had a harmonica that he brought

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:07.460
and he was warming up on the harmonica

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.460
in a restaurant? at the drawing room

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.460
in the bar

01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:13.460
and it was karaoke night

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:15.460
and yes he was warming up to lay down

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.460
a little fucking harp

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.460
was he wearing it with like the metal

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:21.460
no he's like around

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.460
even though he doesn't have a guitar

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:25.460
he's just like

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:27.460
it's a Tesla harmonica

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.460
that'd be great

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.460
if he had the harmonica rig at the air guitar

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:33.460
while he was doing it

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.460
he got up there and played fucking harmonica

01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:37.460
and the crowd was fucking downright mutinous

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.460
nobody

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.460
nobody wanted anyone to bring

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.460
their own harmonica to a bar

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:45.460
I'm

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.460
even though you would think guys of my antipathy

01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.460
toward the antipathy for the scooters

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:51.460
where I'm like oh you're just overreacting

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:53.460
but it's like they were there

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.460
they know

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.460
you know like I trust them

01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.460
the crowd

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:01.460
I'm like don't bring

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.460
props to karaoke

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.460
I feel

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:07.460
at least let it be a surprise

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:09.460
when you're up there

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.460
pull it out of your pocket during like the instrumental

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.460
that would be amazing

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:15.460
during the musical interlude

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:17.460
you like whipped it out of your pocket

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.460
people would be like

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.460
fucking

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:23.460
this brother fucker was warming up in the fucking booth

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.460
that's not

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:27.460
is this guy gonna fucking do a bob don't song

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:29.460
I'll mix it up I'm on this guy's side

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:31.460
you're at karaoke

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.460
to hear another person's shitty version

01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:35.460
of a song that was done well before

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.460
who cares if they're fucking singing it wrong

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:39.460
nobody wants to hear somebody's

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:41.460
fucking harmonica

01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:43.460
was he bad?

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:45.460
yes!

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.460
the purpose of karaoke isn't to

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:49.460
have a song like

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:51.460
Sean name your favorite harmonica player

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:53.460
and why you hesitate

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:55.460
popper

01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:59.460
and that's why we're a team

01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:01.460
my man never lets me

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.460
he's your city hall body man

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:05.460
he's got five harmonica players

01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.460
you didn't believe that

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:09.460
you don't love that guy's harmonica

01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:11.460
I think it's funny

01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:13.460
run around the hook

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:15.460
Neil Young plays

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:17.460
me and harmonica

01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:19.460
but he doesn't bring it to karaoke

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.460
but he brings it to the last waltz

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:23.460
and he's playing it up there

01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:25.460
yeah exactly

01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:27.460
maybe this guy's the next Neil Young

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.460
it must be kind of crazy

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.460
do you think there are prisoners

01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:33.460
that still

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:35.460
like how do you think a prison reacts

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.460
they feel patient

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:39.460
on seablock

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:41.460
it's midnight and then like the new guy

01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:43.460
or he's been there six months

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:45.460
and you just hear like

01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:47.460
and then like the oldest guy goes

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:49.460
nope

01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:51.460
don't

01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:53.460
you have to open up

01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:55.460
what's the Richard Pryor

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:57.460
Gene Wilder one

01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:59.460
way down in the valley

01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.460
and the guy breaks out the

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.460
fucking perfect harmonica

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:05.460
and it's beautiful

01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:07.460
so

01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:13.460
someone trying to play you off

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:15.460
that was my intro music to harmonica

01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:17.460
so I went to

01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:19.460
see maybe this will get groans

01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:21.460
I don't know but I went to see

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.460
Dave Chappelle and John Mayer

01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:25.460
perform

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.460
they did like a tour together

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:29.460
where like John Mayer played like three

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:31.460
John Mayer songs that Dave Chappelle did like 40 minutes to stand up

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:33.460
and then they just like hung out on stage together

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:35.460
I think we love it

01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:37.460
John Mayer is a friend of the podcast

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.460
just to see you guys know

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:41.460
going forward

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:43.460
like when you go outside the ear wolf well

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:45.460
there's other famous people

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:47.460
played tennis with them once

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:49.460
so I

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.460
John Mayer? Yes

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.460
101?

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:55.460
we played doubles actually

01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:57.460
same side or rivals

01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:59.460
rivals

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:01.460
can I ask what the score line was again

01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:03.460
man

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.460
I don't know

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.460
what that means but I think that means you won

01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:09.460
he called me a comedy bully

01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:11.460
I thought you were like a comedy guy

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:13.460
beating our ass

01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:15.460
what would you say is John Mayer's weakness

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.460
and doubles tennis?

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:19.460
an ability to play well

01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:21.460
it's a lack of experience

01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:23.460
is what it is

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.460
he seemed like he was just learning the game

01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:27.460
but when I went to see him with Dave Chappelle

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:29.460
at a certain point they

01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:31.460
wanted to bring out our friend Fred

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.460
now Fred used to be in Prince's band

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.460
and he used to tour with him

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:37.460
and he's going to play harmonica for us

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:39.460
and John Mayer played purple rain

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:41.460
on the guitar

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.460
and Fred did the vocal with the harmonica

01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:45.460
and it was fucking awesome

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:47.460
because it's like

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:49.460
there's these notes up there

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:51.460
very few people can sing

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.460
but when he was just hitting it

01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:55.460
so Fred did all the vocals for purple rain?

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:57.460
he did it

01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:59.460
and the harmonica played

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:01.460
what the vocal melody would be

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.460
but holding these sustained notes

01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:05.460
Fred's the guy that I

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.460
assuming

01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.460
I was dreaming when I wrote this

01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:11.460
what's that song?

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.460
I'm assuming Fred's the guy

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.460
that goes

01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:17.460
well life is just a party

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.460
and parties was meant to last

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.460
that's gotta be Fred because it's the only

01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:23.460
non-prince male voice

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:25.460
I think so

01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:27.460
but it was

01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:29.460
really good and I was like

01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:31.460
harmonica can be pretty cool

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.460
interesting

01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:35.460
I don't even understand

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:37.460
I guess I understand

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.460
pianos are buttons that you press

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.460
so that's a lot like a typewriter

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:43.460
so I get that

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:45.460
what's happening with the harmonica?

01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:47.460
the guitar then you can make my brain

01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:49.460
stretch and go okay you block

01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:51.460
certain strings from going all the way

01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.460
and it just seems like

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:55.460
I ask it for trouble

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:57.460
and I guess you're doing the same thing

01:26:57.460 --> 01:26:59.460
with a fiddle but like

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:01.460
instead of plucking you're stroking

01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:03.460
and

01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:05.460
you got a bunch of holes like I don't have to

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:07.460
describe all musical instruments for you

01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:09.460
but wait no back up

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.460
because it seems like

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.460
you do understand the flute but not the harmonica

01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.460
well I don't

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:17.460
understand the flute well yeah I do because there's buttons

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:19.460
like a typewriter so you blow

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:21.460
you blow into the flute and then you type

01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:23.460
boop boop boop boop

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:25.460
boop boop

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:27.460
fade in and then this happens

01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:29.460
you know call to adventure across the threshold

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:31.460
then you go down and boom

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.460
where's season 4

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:35.460
harmonica is basically

01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:37.460
harmonica is like a little piano like an octave or two

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.460
that you just blow in and out and you get

01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:41.460
you get the white and the black keys

01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:43.460
how do you play the piano?

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.460
whoa

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.460
you dared it man

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:49.460
you said blow into the piano

01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:51.460
I was dead

01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:53.460
oh no

01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:55.460
we're currently out of the hollywood handbook

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:57.460
but I remember my grandpa

01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:59.460
world war 2 veteran

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.460
grandpa

01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:03.460
he had like a harmonica

01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:05.460
that he would play once in a while

01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:07.460
I think he learned to play it in the marines

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.460
when he was just hanging out

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:11.460
in the stuff you see in the thin red line

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.460
my grandpa was there but John Cusack

01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:15.460
wasn't in real life it was just like

01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:17.460
17 year old dudes like hanging out smoking cigarettes

01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:19.460
and

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.460
he had a harmonica

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:23.460
from back then and he could play it

01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:25.460
it was like somehow he learned during his

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:27.460
days in the war to play it

01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:29.460
and I remember him explaining that you use your

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:31.460
tongue

01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:33.460
to block some of the holes

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:35.460
to block other notes yeah

01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:37.460
crazy, crazy instrument

01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:39.460
anybody here has your tongue to block stuff

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:41.460
yeah I think we would have heard it by now

01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:43.460
yeah

01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:45.460
because I can play Osisanna

01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:47.460
if you get a harmonica

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.460
you can play Osisanna

01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:51.460
does anybody have a harmonica, come on

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:53.460
somebody's holding out

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:55.460
will he chain harmonica, come on

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.460
everyone's gotta die 20, no one's got a harmonica

01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:59.460
it's hollywood baby

01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:01.460
somebody's got a harmonica

01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:05.460
oh life is just a part of him

01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:07.460
but his was meant to last

01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:13.460
you kind of went like a little

01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:15.460
catch you fuckers at a bad time

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.460
this flashlight

01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:19.460
shines ultraviolet rays

01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:23.460
well this

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:25.460
bullets tipped with

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.460
sodium nitrate

01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.460
garlic

01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:31.460
it's garlic

01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.460
this here's a bullet

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:35.460
these bullets are cased with

01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:37.460
a chemical sodium

01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:39.460
garlithinol

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:41.460
this is from blade everybody

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.460
that's garlic

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.460
he does the whole thing where he's like

01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.460
come on

01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.460
come on over here gonna show you

01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.460
some shit

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.460
this flashlight

01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:55.460
shines 250

01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:57.460
watts of solid UV

01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:59.460
radiation

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:01.460
sunlight

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.460
these bullets are tipped in canola oil

01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:07.460
combined with sodium pentothal

01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:09.460
traces of laser

01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:11.460
fiber garlic

01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:17.460
these two pieces of wood

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:19.460
are at an actual perpendicular

01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:21.460
it's a cross

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:23.460
no no no

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.460
it's more like

01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:29.460
these defibrillators

01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:31.460
send a sonic frequency

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.460
identical to cuniferous

01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:35.460
vegetation

01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.460
hehehe

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:39.460
clear

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:41.460
ow

01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:43.460
sonic

01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:45.460
tree

01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:47.460
god damn there's

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.460
I can't believe how cool you made killing vampires

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:51.460
it's a great movie no one's good

01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:53.460
you won't catch me saying blade's not good

01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:55.460
that's fun

01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:57.460
David S. Goyer would make a great guest

01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:59.460
book him

01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:01.460
David S. Goyer screenwriter

01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:03.460
you don't have to nod Zach

01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:05.460
Zach's like

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.460
on it

01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:09.460
do you want a beat

01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:11.460
do you want a brainstorm best

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:13.460
okay I'll work on that too

01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:15.460
I'm just waiting for you to want a beat

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:17.460
I think Steve said we

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:19.460
booked Jerry Springer

01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:21.460
Jerry Springer like

01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:23.460
this is such great kismet

01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:25.460
I mean

01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:27.460
I was at the drawing room

01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:29.460
if you're there before noon

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:31.460
I'm sure I wasn't

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:33.460
Jerry Springer will be on the TV

01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:35.460
and like I was like how do we even know this guy

01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:37.460
when is he

01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:39.460
has he stopped making these episodes

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.460
what's he doing

01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:43.460
I was familiar enough that his story is kind of

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:45.460
winding and interesting

01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:47.460
to the point where I'm like I don't want him to die

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:49.460
doing the Jerry Springer show

01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:51.460
and I was wondering like how long has he been doing

01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:53.460
sorry for my gross fucking

01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:55.460
gastro burps

01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:57.460
we'll edit those out

01:31:57.460 --> 01:31:59.460
and it just

01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:01.460
Wikipediaed him

01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:03.460
and it's like he just stopped

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.460
he just finished like doing the Jerry Springer show

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:07.460
and he's like getting ready to do his

01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:09.460
Jerry show

01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:11.460
he has a podcast and I was like

01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:13.460
I texted Levy and was like

01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:15.460
can we get Jerry Springer as a guest

01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.460
because if you read his Wikipedia page

01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:19.460
every single

01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:21.460
every third sentence

01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:23.460
how come this isn't a biopic

01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:25.460
his family escaped the holocaust

01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:27.460
most of his ancestors were

01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.460
isolated during the holocaust

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:31.460
he was born during the Blitz

01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:33.460
that's the really funny thing

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:35.460
his mother gave birth to him during

01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:37.460
funny the

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:39.460
weird

01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:41.460
his mother gave birth to him during the bombings in the tube

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:43.460
in the subway

01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:45.460
basically

01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:47.460
all of his family tree

01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:49.460
this is probably

01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:51.460
an exaggeration

01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:53.460
you get the impression that

01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:55.460
every single one

01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:57.460
of what would have been

01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:59.460
an expansive family tree

01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:01.460
instead became a funnel

01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:03.460
into one

01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:05.460
twig which is Jerry Springer because of the

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:07.460
holocaust

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:09.460
everyone got wiped out

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:11.460
except for this little baby

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:13.460
what was it like he was like

01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:15.460
yeah something like that

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:17.460
that's even a fascinating story

01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:19.460
he invented the typewriter

01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:21.460
Forrest Gump is sort of based loosely on Jerry Springer

01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:23.460
Jerry Springer

01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:25.460
just sort of touched everything

01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:27.460
he also

01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:29.460
did a recent episode called

01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:31.460
babes with baguettes

01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:33.460
because they couldn't say chicks with dicks

01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:35.460
babes

01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:41.460
that's good stuff

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:43.460
is that better

01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:45.460
well you can't

01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:47.460
not still get mad and they're like what

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:49.460
I'm kind of curious does he still

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:51.460
have an episode

01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:53.460
5500 where it was clearly just

01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:55.460
all I ever see is it with the volume down

01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:57.460
I'll just look up and see like

01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:59.460
why is everyone dressed like

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:01.460
Snoopy

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.460
you'll just look up and see some ridiculous

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:05.460
like

01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:07.460
comedia del art play going on

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:09.460
with wigs flying around

01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:11.460
and ideal shoes

01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:13.460
if you look up his biography

01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:15.460
he's quite intellectual

01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:17.460
he's a very

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:19.460
well that's what I wonder

01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:21.460
when I would watch Jerry Springer

01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:23.460
when I was in my 20s and I would

01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:25.460
get high with my vegan hippie

01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:27.460
girlfriend and it was ironic

01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:29.460
enough to watch anything on TV

01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:31.460
we were like eating

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:33.460
vegan sandwiches and we were just like

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:35.460
oh what's on Jerry Springer it's 3 in the afternoon

01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:37.460
I'm 20

01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:39.460
I'm hate watching it but whatever

01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:41.460
what I remember from that

01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:43.460
show back then was like the Springer Final Thoughts

01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:45.460
which were

01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:47.460
inconceivably well written

01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:49.460
I don't know who was writing those things

01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:51.460
Steve the bodyguard guy

01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:53.460
maybe

01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:55.460
it was just the weirdest thing

01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:57.460
you remember Springer's Final Thoughts

01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:59.460
Steve got his own show right

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.460
but did he keep doing those

01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:03.460
because I look up and I'll just see

01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:05.460
a man in a wedding dress

01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:07.460
punching a mouse

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:09.460
and I'll just see it with the volume down

01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:11.460
and I'll be like does he still

01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.460
at the end of that episode go

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:15.460
I mean is

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:17.460
you need to respect people

01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:19.460
and does he recycle his Final Thought

01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:21.460
we kind of covered this ground before

01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:23.460
punching a mouse is also

01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:25.460
a lot like learning clarinet

01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:27.460
I bet they haven't stopped trying

01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:29.460
to fill time on that show

01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:31.460
after 25 years

01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:33.460
so I'm guessing that he still does

01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:35.460
why is there that weird fan

01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:37.460
there's that weird like industrial

01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:39.460
like you're in a basement

01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:41.460
you're where you can trust

01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:43.460
that

01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:45.460
the street justices

01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:47.460
you're in the third act of the third man with Orson Welles

01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:49.460
like why is there the fuck

01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:51.460
you're away from the prying eyes of our already corrupt system

01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:55.460
you're in Fagan's hideout

01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:57.460
you know it's like look

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.460
this pickpocket asked for more soup get him

01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:01.460
I never read Oliver Twist

01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:05.460
I believe Fagan had a

01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:07.460
hideout in the story where he pitted you

01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:09.460
against

01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:11.460
I think that we're led to believe that we're

01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:13.460
in some sort of underground

01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:15.460
fight club kind of thing

01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:17.460
that might need to be dried off quickly

01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:19.460
in a pinch

01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:21.460
fire up that fan

01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:23.460
and kind of point it at the floor

01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:25.460
I'm going to clear the courtroom

01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:27.460
he might threaten the entire audience

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:29.460
before the cameras roll

01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:31.460
I have in my hand a button

01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:33.460
and that fan works

01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:35.460
and will suck all organic material

01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:37.460
shoot it through a cannon

01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:39.460
across the Atlantic

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:41.460
he escaped annihilation

01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:43.460
from the

01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:45.460
German holocaust of Jews

01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:47.460
and he made it to Chicago and became like a

01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:49.460
almost a senator

01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:51.460
he ran for governor or mayor

01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:53.460
he was a decent politician

01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:55.460
here's something really interesting about his political career

01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:57.460
that I saw on his Wikipedia page

01:36:57.460 --> 01:36:59.460
so before

01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:01.460
the mayor of Cincinnati thing

01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:03.460
he got interested in politics

01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:05.460
and then there was this

01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:07.460
he got arrested with a

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:09.460
there was a sex worker

01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.460
scandal

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:13.460
that kind of marred him

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.460
he wrote a check

01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:17.460
he paid for sex work with a personal check

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:19.460
but it wasn't

01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:21.460
he didn't pay for it with

01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:23.460
taxpayers money he didn't pay for it with campaign funds

01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:25.460
it was

01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:27.460
I don't know if he was married maybe that was his crime

01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:29.460
he was unfaithful but like

01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:31.460
it was a scandal

01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:33.460
as per the times

01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:35.460
but the interesting thing is that he

01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:41.460
there was a thing subsequent to that

01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:43.460
where he wanted to run for another thing

01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:45.460
and

01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:47.460
and it was like

01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:49.460
and

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:51.460
his campaign

01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:53.460
was using that

01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:55.460
check and his slogan was like

01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:57.460
something like you can count on me

01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:59.460
I got nothing to hide

01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:01.460
something like I'll tell the truth

01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:03.460
even if it hurts

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:05.460
that's exactly what it was

01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:07.460
I mean this guy is singing my song

01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:09.460
I mean it's like

01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:11.460
I just want him to be happy

01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:13.460
I don't want him to like Robert Altman

01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:15.460
like die on a set

01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:17.460
I want him to die on a Joseph Campbell

01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:19.460
on a porch somewhere he's done enough

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:21.460
Joseph Campbell died on a porch

01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:23.460
yeah as you should

01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:25.460
was it his porch

01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:27.460
or somebody else's porch

01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:29.460
of course it was his porch

01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:31.460
I don't know

01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:33.460
whose porch do you think you're supposed to die on

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:35.460
Joseph Campbell could have died on anybody's porch

01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:37.460
he could have died on Carl Jung's porch I don't know

01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:39.460
don't die on another person's porch

01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:41.460
that's what a mummy does

01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:43.460
that's rude

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:45.460
let's face it that's rude

01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:47.460
that's a

01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:49.460
that's a ghost story

01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:51.460
new rules

01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:53.460
die on your own porch

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.460
but yeah

01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:57.460
how badass would be to die on somebody else's porch

01:38:57.460 --> 01:38:59.460
all right well you're always in it for the thrill

01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:01.460
but like

01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:03.460
you're gonna get to be my age

01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:05.460
three months from now

01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:07.460
when I die on your porch you're gonna go fuck

01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:09.460
if you die on my porch

01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:11.460
I'm gonna

01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:13.460
I'm gonna high five your corpse

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:15.460
you're gonna be going to a meeting in the morning

01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:17.460
you're gonna see a dead Jeff Tapers on your porch

01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:19.460
you go fucking guy

01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:21.460
die on my porch

01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:23.460
so the bitch really did it

01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:25.460
I'm picturing him finding you just kind of falling out of your car

01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:27.460
in front of his house

01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:29.460
and like you tried to get over there

01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:31.460
but he didn't quite make it

01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:33.460
hey if you had to die on someone's porch

01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:35.460
somebody a porch other than your own

01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:37.460
whose porch would you like to be dead on

01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:39.460
I know my man here is thinking

01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:41.460
he's got a great porch

01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.460
and you really do

01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:45.460
oh yeah I'd be pretty offended if Hayes didn't say my porch

01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:47.460
that was my first thought

01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:49.460
and of course since I've already stated

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:51.460
that dying on someone else's porch is rude

01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:53.460
you know I'm dying on the porch of the orange buffoon

01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:55.460
oh nice

01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:57.460
the cheeto in chief

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.460
let's all die on the

01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:03.460
capital steps

01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:05.460
that's right I'm marching right up to the white house

01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:07.460
I'm dying

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:09.460
on the porch of Mar-a-Lago

01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:11.460
wait

01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:13.460
speaking of the capital steps

01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:15.460
Dan and I sent you a message

01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:17.460
Dan and I hate the

01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:19.460
comedy satire group

01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:21.460
and I use all those words in fucking quotations

01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:23.460
the capital steps

01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:25.460
might be the worst

01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:27.460
professional jealousy

01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:29.460
they're playing in Pasadena

01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:31.460
we kind of have to go there

01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:33.460
what do they do now

01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:35.460
like that question was

01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:37.460
viable back in the dangling chat days

01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:39.460
I was like okay this is all too funny now

01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:41.460
in parodies itself

01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:43.460
now what do they do

01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:45.460
well sometimes you're a Nazi

01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:47.460
and you don't want to be one

01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:49.460
what are their parody songs about

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:51.460
I mean lots of stuff

01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:53.460
rhymes with Bill Barr

01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:55.460
probably personalities

01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:57.460
I guess it's the same old thing

01:40:57.460 --> 01:40:59.460
it always boils down to that anyway

01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:01.460
fucking capital steps

01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:03.460
I want to fucking punch all of them

01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:05.460
there's a lot of funny stuff you can do with ice

01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:07.460
ice baby

01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:09.460
picture him like ice

01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:11.460
they had to burn that right away

01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:13.460
they're probably trying to figure out

01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:15.460
yeah ice baby

01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:17.460
they lock up babies in the cages

01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:19.460
it's fucking perfect

01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:21.460
yeah do you think they have standards

01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:23.460
when they're like oh it's too soon

01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:25.460
or it's too sensitive

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:27.460
I guess that's my big question

01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:29.460
is like politics are no longer

01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:31.460
like it's like you can't really

01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:33.460
yeah do they like

01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:35.460
oh we're not gonna do that because

01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:37.460
well we'll be I got a great rhyme for that

01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:39.460
but someone will start crying

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.460
I'm pretty sure

01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:43.460
that one of the capital steps comes out with a diaper on

01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:45.460
and goes I'm an ice

01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:47.460
ice baby

01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:49.460
they're locked up and they're at the border

01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:51.460
I guarantee that's a fucking thing

01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:53.460
I have a lot of friends in the capital

01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:55.460
steps

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:57.460
not a lot, three

01:41:57.460 --> 01:41:59.460
and they have a policy

01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:01.460
which is yes they'll say something is too soon

01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:03.460
which means we have to do it

01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:05.460
nice

01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:07.460
that's the Breckheimer

01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:09.460
school

01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.460
that's when he did Conair

01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:13.460
what was that that happened

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:15.460
it was too close to a convict

01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:17.460
killing everyone

01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:19.460
landing an airplane on a Las Vegas drip

01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:21.460
I don't remember that

01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:23.460
there was a real Conair

01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:25.460
and Breckheimer was like

01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:27.460
too soon let's do it

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:29.460
wow

01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:31.460
Dave Chappelle

01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:33.460
in that movie

01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:35.460
oh yeah

01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:37.460
I've never seen it

01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:39.460
also it's a

01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:41.460
you haven't seen it?

01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:43.460
worth watching

01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.460
I've heard

01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:47.460
somebody was talking about that movie

01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.460
they should make a movie about that movie

01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:51.460
because clearly

01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:53.460
so many things happened on that set

01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:55.460
so many things changed about

01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:57.460
everyone

01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:59.460
everyone that showed up to that set

01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:01.460
it was like

01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:03.460
people coming

01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:05.460
whose cars breaking down outside

01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:07.460
a haunted house or something

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:09.460
everything changed on that set

01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:11.460
oh yeah

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:13.460
I wish I could remember Nick Cage's name

01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:15.460
I know one of the prisoners gets introduced

01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:17.460
and they go

01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:19.460
A.K.A. Diamond Dog

01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:21.460
Diamond Dog?

01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:23.460
yeah he's got a name

01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:25.460
I don't know what that name is

01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:27.460
but then they say A.K.A. Diamond Dog

01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:29.460
because he's a big David Bowie fan

01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:31.460
huge Bowie fan

01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:33.460
yeah

01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:35.460
John Kuzak is driving around

01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.460
on the ground in that movie

01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:39.460
and he knows

01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:41.460
that

01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:43.460
John Kuzak's a cop

01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:45.460
he's a good guy

01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:47.460
he's like a librarian

01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:49.460
he's in communication with Nick Cage

01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:51.460
who's a convict with a heart of gold

01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:53.460
and he's just trying to get home to his daughter

01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:55.460
and he wants to bring her this stuffed bunny

01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:57.460
and if that other convict doesn't

01:43:57.460 --> 01:43:59.460
put the bunny down as he famously says

01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:01.460
in the movie

01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:03.460
he's gonna kill him and he does

01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:05.460
so Nick Cage doesn't want

01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:07.460
he's only in jail because his hands are

01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:09.460
deadly weapons I think

01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:11.460
so he kills someone

01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:13.460
and it's not fair

01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:15.460
he got in a bar fight like defending someone's honor

01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:17.460
and then wound up killing them

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:19.460
so he doesn't want

01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:21.460
I'm sorry I keep asking the same question

01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:23.460
but he definitely does not want

01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:25.460
no he's a good guy

01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:27.460
he wants to do his time

01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.460
he wants to pay his debt to society

01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:31.460
he wants to pay his debt to society

01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:33.460
he's going home I think

01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:35.460
I think he's going out of prison

01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:37.460
when Conair gets hijacked

01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:39.460
he's going home

01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:41.460
his reaction is basically oh brother

01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:43.460
so that's how

01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.460
that was the impetus of the movie

01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:47.460
it was like oh Conair

01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:49.460
it transports criminals

01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:51.460
and some of them are like

01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:53.460
I did it and then they look around

01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:55.460
and they're like these guys

01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:57.460
I don't want to be a plan

01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:59.460
oh brother

01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:01.460
they'd love for this plane to

01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:03.460
deactivate the smoke detectors

01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:05.460
good gravy

01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:07.460
oh my goodness

01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:09.460
imagine me

01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:11.460
being in the position of a goodie goodie

01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:13.460
after all this time

01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:15.460
I get it now

01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:17.460
that's a great movie

01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:19.460
it kicks ass

01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:21.460
so what's the crisis

01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:23.460
what's the meeting with the goddess

01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:25.460
for Nick Cage

01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:27.460
oh jeez thank you for asking

01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:29.460
well

01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:31.460
okay

01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:33.460
it's a movie about

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:35.460
convicts getting on an airplane

01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:37.460
hence the title Conair

01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:39.460
some are going away for a long time

01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:41.460
some are just trying to get through it

01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:43.460
it's like a cast of misfits

01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:45.460
somebody on the plane

01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:47.460
I would have assumed Nick Cage

01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:49.460
but now I'm here

01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:51.460
someone else on the plane is a bad guy

01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:53.460
who's got a plan

01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:55.460
modern equivalent of your watch

01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:57.460
huh

01:45:57.460 --> 01:45:59.460
is it John Malkovich

01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:01.460
who is the bad guy

01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:03.460
who's the main bad guy

01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:05.460
I don't think he's the guy who actually kicks it off

01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:07.460
but he might have been

01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:09.460
I know this isn't going to be the case

01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:11.460
but it's a Breckheimer movie

01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:13.460
so I want John Kuzak to not be a cop

01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:15.460
I want John Kuzak to be something one off a cop

01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:17.460
like he's a veterinarian

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:19.460
or a biographer

01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:21.460
who's like I just need

01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:23.460
to write

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:25.460
I need one chapter from

01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:27.460
the character when he lands

01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:29.460
and then somehow he's roped into

01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:31.460
profiling or something

01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:33.460
so they're getting on the plane

01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:35.460
so page 25 is going to be

01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:37.460
the hijacking of the plane

01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:39.460
so then

01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:41.460
your question is what happens on page 60

01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:43.460
the answer is going to be

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:45.460
the convicts are officially in charge

01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:47.460
of where the plane is going

01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:49.460
but where is our

01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:51.460
Nick Cage is our protagonist

01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:53.460
Cameron Poe

01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:55.460
it's a two-hander

01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:57.460
it's a buddy comedy

01:46:57.460 --> 01:46:59.460
not a comedy

01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:01.460
he's Bruce Willis

01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:03.460
what's his name

01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:05.460
Cyrus the Virus

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:07.460
Malkovich is named Cyrus the Virus

01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:09.460
Ving Reims is Diamond Dog

01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:11.460
I believe he's kind of a good guy too

01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:13.460
Ving Reims is another guy by the way

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.460
who's like eternally 48

01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:17.460
they find a Ving Reims movie

01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:19.460
where he's 20

01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:21.460
Kuzak's a US Marshal

01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:23.460
it's Larkin

01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:25.460
it's Barry Larkin's cousin

01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:27.460
it's 60 minutes into the movie

01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:29.460
if it's two hours

01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:31.460
half way point of the movie

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:33.460
means that the convicts are now flying the plane somewhere

01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:35.460
is he on the convict's side

01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:37.460
or on the side of the law at this point

01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:39.460
he's probably trying to play both sides

01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:41.460
he's playing both sides

01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:43.460
he's got to get home to his daughter

01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:45.460
he's got to do whatever is going to get him home safe

01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:47.460
and

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:49.460
if that means letting Cyrus the Virus

01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:51.460
who's an evil genius

01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:53.460
believe for a moment that maybe he's on the

01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:55.460
side of the convicts well then that's what he's going to do

01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:57.460
and here's where I'd ask

01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:59.460
how is he in contact with the

01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:01.460
his buddy in this buddy cop movie

01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:03.460
but I already know because

01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:05.460
this conversation I had with this friend

01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:07.460
who was telling me they should make a movie about that movie

01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:09.460
is the part where Dave

01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:11.460
Dave Chappelle is

01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:13.460
a note is

01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:15.460
attached to his body

01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:17.460
and he's thrown out of the airplane

01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:19.460
his body lands on a car

01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:21.460
and the note is still legible

01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.460
because

01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:25.460
if a human body falls from a plane

01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:27.460
and lands hilariously on

01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:29.460
probably some douchebag's car

01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:31.460
he's like the guy is like

01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:33.460
he's like hey

01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:35.460
I'm sure he's like

01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:37.460
telling a valet like

01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:39.460
if I see one fucking scratch on that thing

01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:41.460
I'm going to do even more cocaine

01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:43.460
come on girls

01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:45.460
girls

01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:47.460
we don't want to go

01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:49.460
you don't get agency

01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:51.460
smash

01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:53.460
what the fuck

01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:55.460
that's my car

01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:57.460
and then Cusack pulls up

01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:59.460
Librarian

01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:01.460
what

01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:03.460
it's written in teddy bear

01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:05.460
hair

01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:07.460
I'm on flight 740 aka the jailbird

01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:09.460
yeah

01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:11.460
the convicts have taken over the plane

01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:13.460
it's a matter of

01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:15.460
it's a mystery where they're going

01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:17.460
it's like a race to figure out

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:19.460
where they're going to try to land

01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:21.460
so the goddess is probably

01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:23.460
Chappelle hitting the car

01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:25.460
that's probably the meeting with the goddess

01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:27.460
because it's the truth that you didn't know

01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:29.460
you were seeking

01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.460
do you think you wouldn't be able to read the note

01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:33.460
if somebody got thrown from the plane

01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:35.460
Dave Chappelle?

01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:37.460
no I mean like

01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:39.460
do you think that if someone was thrown from a plane

01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:41.460
you'd have to go that you'd be able to

01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.460
when it was like their body would explode

01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:45.460
how was it attached

01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:47.460
like a safety pin or

01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:49.460
it's like in permanent marker on the white shirt

01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:51.460
he's wearing

01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:53.460
this body would be liquefied

01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:55.460
the moment you hit the car

01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:57.460
if you fall from very low or very high

01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:01.460
your body room is completely attacked

01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:03.460
there's a sweet spot in the middle where you explode

01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:07.460
off a building you explode from a plane

01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:09.460
you're fine

01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:11.460
a lot of people don't understand that

01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:13.460
if you hold your breath theoretically the right time

01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:15.460
you don't need to parachute

01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:17.460
to skydive

01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:19.460
if you land on a car the car collapses

01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:21.460
it's a good place

01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:23.460
if you're falling and right before you hit the ground you jump

01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:25.460
you just have to jump

01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:27.460
it's basically impossible

01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:29.460
but theoretically

01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:31.460
if you jump right before you hit the ground

01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:33.460
you actually

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:35.460
not only don't need to parachute

01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:37.460
you

01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:39.460
you come

01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:41.460
and you sneeze

01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:45.460
yeah

01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:47.460
and you learn three languages

01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:49.460
but you don't get to pick which one

01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:51.460
nope

01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:57.460
two of them are always

01:50:57.460 --> 01:50:59.460
Esperanto

01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:01.460
Esperanto

01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:05.460
that'd be awesome

01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:07.460
you're super powers you can speak a language

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.460
but you don't get to pick

01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:11.460
you just don't know what you're fucking talking about

01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:13.460
it'd be amazing if you're one super powers

01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:15.460
if someone throws you out of an airplane

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:17.460
you land without

01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:19.460
harm

01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:21.460
you're probably trying to get yourself in

01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:23.460
situations

01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:25.460
at a bar somebody's intimidating

01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:27.460
don't talk to my girlfriend that way

01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:29.460
to tell you what man

01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:31.460
let's just

01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:33.460
go to the immediate conclusion here

01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:35.460
let's get up in a plane

01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:37.460
you throw me out

01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:39.460
not over the ocean over land

01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:45.460
oh man 80% water

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:47.460
it's not part of it

01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:51.460
don't you guys

01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:53.460
new hollywood question

01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:55.460
don't you think someone in the movie

01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:57.460
follows

01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:59.460
don't you think

01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:01.460
someone should have said

01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:03.460
let's try

01:52:03.460 --> 01:52:05.460
I have a friend who works as a flight attendant

01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:07.460
let's have sex with them

01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:09.460
right

01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:11.460
see what happens

01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:13.460
did someone have that friend

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:15.460
well everyone is only

01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:17.460
two degrees separation from a flight attendant

01:52:17.460 --> 01:52:19.460
here's what I'm worried about

01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:21.460
those degrees are always fucking degrees

01:52:21.460 --> 01:52:23.460
those people are fucking

01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:25.460
horny

01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:27.460
flight attendants for the most part

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:29.460
work like one round

01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:31.460
trip or like a couple

01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:33.460
in a couple days

01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:35.460
but it's not going to get that far

01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:37.460
because it's walking

01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:39.460
and so then the flight attendant goes home

01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:41.460
it has like a month layoff

01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:43.460
a lot of these people do it part time

01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:45.460
so

01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:47.460
now the monster that has gotten

01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:49.460
like what two miles

01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:51.460
in the time of that plane round trip

01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:53.460
what I hear you saying is don't

01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:55.460
take off from Denver

01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:57.460
JFK

01:52:57.460 --> 01:52:59.460
like fuck somebody

01:52:59.460 --> 01:53:01.460
let it follow you to the airport

01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:03.460
get on the plane

01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:05.460
first of all it's like it follows

01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:07.460
you through security

01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:09.460
I'd love to see that

01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:11.460
yes

01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:13.460
and then like peace

01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:15.460
see ya and it's like it following

01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:17.460
and you're like

01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:19.460
and it goes out on the tarmac and it's like

01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:21.460
and

01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:23.460
and then it just walks into the fucking ocean

01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:25.460
you're going to Tokyo

01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:27.460
from JFK

01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:29.460
you don't need to be a flight attendant to get on a plane though

01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:31.460
well I was right

01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:33.460
well because I would say this

01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:35.460
but they are most likely to get

01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:37.460
on a plane you have to admit

01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:39.460
I'm already

01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:41.460
when I saw the movie I was like get on a plane and the people are like

01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:43.460
must be nice

01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:45.460
okay alright

01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:47.460
they use clamshell phones

01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:49.460
obviously

01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:51.460
hello

01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:53.460
privilege and I'm like okay well

01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:55.460
fuck a flight attendant which

01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:57.460
literally is something anyone can do

01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:03.460
these people are

01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:05.460
worse than renaissance fair employees

01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:09.460
they are

01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:11.460
are worlds

01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:13.460
disease conduit

01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:15.460
it's out of the

01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:17.460
956

01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:19.460
Google it

01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:21.460
Google the

01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:23.460
phrase patient zero

01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:25.460
and see how quickly any airline

01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:27.460
comes up

01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:29.460
alright too much

01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:31.460
well look I'll tell ya

01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:33.460
you see there's another

01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:35.460
like all these measles cases popping up everywhere

01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:37.460
and every time one happens they show that person's like

01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:39.460
whole itinerary for a couple days

01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:41.460
and the one from the other day

01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:43.460
they put up was

01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:45.460
8x terminal 2

01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:47.460
the employee shuttle

01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:49.460
to a hotel

01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:51.460
and then the barn's a noble at the grove

01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:53.460
the j crew at the grove

01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:55.460
oh embarrassing

01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:57.460
I hate for my itinerary to be out there

01:54:57.460 --> 01:54:59.460
a coldplay concert

01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:03.460
the news anchor's like

01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:05.460
okay

01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:07.460
I guess they spend a lot of time in the air

01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:09.460
hey can you just put that I went to a movie theater

01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:11.460
you don't have to say like what I saw

01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:13.460
yeah there was that whole

01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:15.460
Avengers Endgame

01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:17.460
which I feel like oh the Avengers Endgame audience

01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:19.460
may have been exposed to

01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:21.460
right no they passed on that

01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:23.460
went to j crew

01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:25.460
but what I'm saying is based on this itinerary

01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:27.460
and then they went back to the airport on the employee shuttle

01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:29.460
so it was probably a flight it doesn't

01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:31.460
they fuck a lot

01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:35.460
you get measles man

01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:37.460
people don't want to tell you

01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:39.460
I get pretty drunk in the last half hour of the show

01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:41.460
I

01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:43.460
I say stuff that I later regret

01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:45.460
if you're a flight attendant and you're human

01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:47.460
I'm already sorry

01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:49.460
I do want to say

01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:55.460
if you're a flight attendant and you're not human

01:55:55.460 --> 01:55:57.460
come on come do the show

01:55:57.460 --> 01:55:59.460
yeah

01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:01.460
yeah

01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:03.460
it follows monster I do think can walk across

01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:05.460
the bottom of the ocean

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:07.460
for sure that's what I'm counting on

01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:09.460
I'm saying to my friend who works for jet blue

01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:11.460

01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:19.460
yeah

01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:21.460
it's like a timeless evocation

01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:23.460
of the 80s or slash 90s

01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:25.460

so you understand

01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:41.460
there's going to be an apparition that's walking

01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:43.460
after you hey man

01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:45.460
it's welcome to do it

01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:47.460
I'm going to Tokyo

01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:49.460
and then just like watch this thing like walking

01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:51.460
along the fucking

01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:53.460
ocean floor going back

01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:55.460
even if it is what he said where it's like

01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:57.460
you're just going like Dallas to

01:56:57.460 --> 01:56:59.460
New York or something every week

01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:01.460
isn't the thing going to walk

01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:03.460
like halfway to

01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:05.460
back and then it's just going to be like

01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:07.460
this is what I'm saying

01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:09.460
this is what I'm saying about their work schedule

01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:11.460
it doesn't it's not that consistent

01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:13.460
they mostly work part time

01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:15.460
they'll do a couple round trips and then be

01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:17.460
back in Dallas

01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:19.460
but you're saying they're there for a month

01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:21.460
yeah they can but often

01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:23.460
they're there for three days

01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:25.460
three days you know two weeks

01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:27.460
and then

01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:29.460
I'm just saying if it had

01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:31.460
walked like halfway through Ohio

01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:33.460
and then it's like this motherfucker's

01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:35.460
back in Texas

01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:37.460
turn around like Jesus Christ

01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:39.460
I guess I'll walk back

01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:41.460
and then just as they're getting back

01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:43.460
into fucking

01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:45.460
Jeff Davis County

01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:47.460
yeah I don't know

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.460
like what are you a

01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:51.460
stockholder and it follows Inc

01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:53.460
well I like the Tokyo version

01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:55.460
of

01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:57.460
you have sex with someone

01:57:57.460 --> 01:57:59.460
they fly to Tokyo which is where they live

01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:01.460
and they or they're just going to spend

01:58:01.460 --> 01:58:03.460
enough time there that it

01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:05.460
follows will follow into the

01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:07.460
like ocean floor

01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:09.460
right like I got a better

01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:11.460
idea how to solve that movie

01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:13.460
just don't have sex

01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:15.460
we've all got to be having sex all

01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:17.460
the time read a

01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:19.460
book like maybe

01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:53.460
enjoyable from a standpoint of someone

01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:55.460
who doesn't know or care about sports

01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:57.460
wow that's high

01:59:57.460 --> 01:59:59.460

who you written for who do you like

02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:17.460
we're both from New England until we like

02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:19.460
the Celtics

02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:21.460
and then we are

02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:23.460
Clippers season ticket holders

02:00:23.460 --> 02:00:25.460
and we go to a lot of the games

02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:27.460
I'm from LA so fuck the Celtics

02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:29.460

02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:33.460
so all the teams I like

02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:35.460

02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:37.460
for the Warriors too loose

02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:39.460

02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:45.460

02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:47.460
that was just getting rolling

02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:49.460
I thought

02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:51.460
sometimes Jesus

02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:53.460
has got to dry the bowling lane

02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:59.460
what the fuck does that

02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:01.460
I don't know dude I don't know

02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:03.460
the ball doesn't go down

02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.460
if it's not wet

02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:07.460
I'm going to start a new podcast

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:09.460
with Sean and Hayes about what the fuck you just said

02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:11.460
we're just going to spread the next

02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:13.460
three years parsing what you just said

02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:15.460
why does Jesus have to dry a bowling lane

02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:17.460
just because sports are about

02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:19.460
competition between all of the

02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:21.460
city's teams doesn't

02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:23.460
mean that sports

02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:25.460
can't be about all of them being together

02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:27.460
give me a
