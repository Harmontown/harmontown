I mean, I did some singing today, hands-free, but, you know, it doesn't, the difference...\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:16.000\nDo you do the hands-free Tesla stuff? Like, do you actually let the car drive?\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:17.000\nI'm a freeway, yeah.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\n100%, it's a way better driver than me, for sure.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:24.000\nI mean, I'm not kidding. It has a million sensors.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:31.000\nI've always been, I just, I get such a panic about lane changes.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:38.000\nLike, I'm just so bad at blind spot stuff. I just, it makes it all the worse that I'm so phobic about cutting someone off.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:44.000\nOkay, so you're on the five freeway. You're going toward the interchange where you could go to Glendale or you could stay on the five.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:50.000\nAnd the car knows that you're going to go to Starburns. It changes lanes for you?\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:56.000\nYeah, all of the freeway stuff. As soon as you're, once you're on the freeway, now it'll, yeah, it'll change lanes for you.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:01.000\nThey're upgrading as it goes. It's kind of fun. It feels like you're like a beta tester. It's like they...\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nYou are.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nThey issue these upgrades, you know?\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nAgain, terrifying.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:11.000\nWell, it doesn't let you, there's nothing to be, it's not going to let you...\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:15.000\nBut it knows the guy behind you isn't a fucking lunatic and it's not going to run you down?\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nIt knows that, yes.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:18.000\nIt doesn't...\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:19.000\nThank you, Spencer.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.000\nThey just added that.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:32.000\nDid you hear, there's this guy who, like, he died. Supposedly the autopilot just knocked him into the highway defyter or something and just smashed his car all up to death.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:37.000\nIt's, yeah, I'm not going to trust the thing for decades.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:42.000\nI mean, but what it is, is it's like the best cruise control ever.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:50.000\nIt just takes care, it takes like a fucking grunt work and frustration out of, like, driving...\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nAre your hands, like, on the wheel and your feet on the pedals?\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:56.000\nYeah, that's the legal standard. You got to do that, so that's what he does.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:03.000\nI'm not going to go to sleep. I don't trust the fucking thing, but I will take advantage of it wanting to do the work for me.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:09.000\nIt has sensors all over it that are better at telling me if there's anyone in my blind spot.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nLike, I'm still going to look, you know?\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:14.000\nI'm just doing, I'm just more relaxed now.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nIt's not like I'm, like, sleeping, it won't let you.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:20.000\nBut what's interesting is how they're, like, rolling out these upgrades.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nI didn't want to talk about this. This is a douche talk.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:26.000\nBut it is, it is fun to, like, you're getting these upgrades and, like, it was for a while.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nYou get on the freeway and then it would, like, it was, it was, like,\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:34.000\nI'm going to change lanes, but you have to confirm that I can change lanes.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:37.000\nHow? By using the signal.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:41.000\nIt's just, like, it was just, like, such a, it was, like, what are we doing here?\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:45.000\nYou know, it's like, like, if I'm signaling, like, just let me turn the goddamn wheel.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nBut, like, now it's changed.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:51.000\nNow it's, it's, it's like, oh no, it'll signal on its own.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nAll you have to do is keep your hands on the wheel because before it changes lanes,\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:58.000\nit just wants to check in with you and you give a little resistance on the wheel\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nto prove that you're not asleep in the backseat.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:04.000\nAnyways, I didn't want to talk about that.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:07.000\nI love my fucking car. I think it's so cool.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:10.000\nI love the people that try to, like, make me not love it.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:15.000\nWhen I see you, when I look at your awesome Instagram songs,\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:19.000\nmy question is, are, like, how much are you driving or not driving while you're doing that?\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:22.000\nI'm probably 95% of the time I'm driving.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:23.000\nOkay.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:28.000\nBecause I'm probably not on the freeway, or if I am, I'm like, yeah,\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:31.000\nthe auto driving thing is not, like, it's not Minority Report.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:35.000\nIt's not, it's not like, I did today because I was going all the way to Encino,\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:40.000\nwhere I was for a while, I was just chilling hands-free while I was making up a song.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:43.000\nAnd maybe that's why I came up with this, I'm not going to play it,\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:46.000\nbut I just, like, it was, like, this really touching song.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:50.000\nIt was, like, I just started singing, like, what, it was, like, where are my homies?\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nWhere are my friends?\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nWho wrote this movie? How does it end?\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:59.000\nOr, or, or, it turned out to be about gay gangbangers from, it was, like,\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:03.000\njust the way the rhymes worked, it was, like, I got to the end of it and I was, like,\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\noh my God, that's so touching. Like, it's not even funny at all.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:10.000\nIn fact, if you perceived it as a joke, then it would be a homophobic joke.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:17.000\nSo I better be serious about this beautiful love story between two fucking gay dudes from East LA\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:21.000\nthat just want to run away together because a way rhymes with gay,\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nbut also because it's a beautiful story, anyways.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nI'm assuming we have more people in the audience tonight than usual\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nbecause of our handsome friends that are here.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:34.000\nIs that true? How many, how many people are here for our guests?\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:35.000\nOkay, thank you.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:36.000\nGreat.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nI think that was 11.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.000\nOh wait, are you here, did I, did I say something that ended up on TMZ?\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nIs that why you're here?\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:45.000\nI don't, okay.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:48.000\nAm I racist again?\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:57.000\nUm, you know what, I'll field that. I am.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:00.000\nYou were off it for a while, but you're back, baby.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:03.000\nI tried to quit.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:06.000\nYou got to accept the thoughts already. Give me that or you take a contrary action.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:10.000\nOkay, I don't want to cheat our guests of time, but I just wanted to, like,\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:16.000\nokay, so I still maintain you are overreacting to the lime scooter thing.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:21.000\nI think that, you know, there's this new thing that you guys are doing.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:26.000\nAt first you were like, I don't like these scooters because they're new.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nAnd they're everywhere.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nYou don't like new things that are everywhere.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nWe were just talking about this backstage.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:35.000\nThat's why you don't support the transgender community or anything like that.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:39.000\nYou hate different things that are sweeping and changing the way people,\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nand challenging people, right?\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:41.000\nNo, you're hypocrites.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:47.000\nLike, maybe your sidewalk is identifying as like, orwellian.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nLike, it's a fucking scooter. I think it's a great idea.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nOr maybe it's not. Let's find out.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nDon't police it.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nThat being said, I'm 46.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nI'm not going to use one of these things for a while.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nI'd see them like, one of these days, I'm going to use one of these.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nThey're fun. They're so fun.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nSo the day finally came.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nI drive home from work and there's one right in front of my house.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nOkay.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nIt's parked there.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nI'm like, this is probably it because I'm going to be late to Little Dom's,\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nwhich is like probably a seven and a half minute walk.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:18.000\nIt's impossible to drive there in park, et cetera.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nThis is scooter time.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nIt's four blocks from your place.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nYeah. It was just right enough that I'm like,\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:28.000\nokay, how long is the process going to be of like the first time you do?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nI'm assuming there's a QR code on.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:35.000\nI'm like, if this is as easy as one of those vending machines with the QR code app,\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:38.000\nI'm like, man, am I glad I embraced that technology?\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:42.000\nLike I became Lord of the Fritos and like only in that one city,\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:45.000\nbut like maybe I'm going to become scooter guy now.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:49.000\nThis is it. I walked down there and I'm like, I scanned the QR code.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nWe're off to the races.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nThis is like the map loading.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nOkay.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:59.000\nAnd this guy my age, he's got a wallet chain.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:03.000\nOh, good start.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:06.000\nHe's, I just don't understand this impulse from people.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nLike he sees me.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nI guess he's a neighbor.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:12.000\nHe felt very comfortable talking to me.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:17.000\nLike I'm like, he sees me from...\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nHe's 100 yards away.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.780\nstarts walking towards me diagonally across the street\n\n10:22.780 --> 10:27.580\nwhile shouting out in a parent camaraderie,\n\n10:27.580 --> 10:29.340\nassumed camaraderie with me because,\n\n10:29.340 --> 10:31.820\nbut he sees me scanning the scooter.\n\n10:31.820 --> 10:35.340\nBut he's got filled with so much hatred about the scooters\n\n10:35.340 --> 10:38.420\nthat he must assume that I'm like reporting the scooter\n\n10:38.420 --> 10:44.900\nto the Gen X times or something like, here's another one.\n\n10:44.900 --> 10:48.340\nPlus they have too much avocado toast all the time.\n\n10:48.340 --> 10:49.740\nOh, if I'm going to hate millennials,\n\n10:49.740 --> 10:51.780\nit's going to be for a really good reason.\n\n10:51.780 --> 10:55.380\nBut not because of the fucking contributions.\n\n10:55.380 --> 10:59.100\nJesus, because of the other stuff.\n\n10:59.100 --> 11:01.140\nLike the dumb name, for instance.\n\n11:01.140 --> 11:03.260\nYou're trying to get online with the scooter.\n\n11:03.260 --> 11:05.260\nSo I'm like, yeah, I'm like interacting with it.\n\n11:05.260 --> 11:07.300\nAnd he's just like, how comfortable\n\n11:07.300 --> 11:09.820\ncould you ever be in the assumption that, oh, he goes,\n\n11:09.820 --> 11:12.460\nhe goes, you know what I'd like to do with those fucking things?\n\n11:12.460 --> 11:14.620\nI'd like to take every single one of those motherfuckers,\n\n11:14.620 --> 11:18.100\nput it on my truck, take it to the city dump.\n\n11:18.100 --> 11:20.180\nYou could do that.\n\n11:20.180 --> 11:22.900\nNo one's stopping him from doing that.\n\n11:22.900 --> 11:26.820\nAlso, it's a weird flex, is what the kids would say.\n\n11:26.820 --> 11:29.420\nThat's a South Park episode, the Halloween episode\n\n11:29.420 --> 11:32.140\nwhere somebody does that and takes all the scooters\n\n11:32.140 --> 11:33.180\nand throws them off a cliff.\n\n11:33.180 --> 11:35.940\nOh, shit, man, the Rick and Morty ones not coming out\n\n11:35.940 --> 11:39.060\nfor three years.\n\n11:39.060 --> 11:41.180\nThat's why, no, we learned that lesson a long time ago.\n\n11:41.180 --> 11:44.980\nDon't, it went fairly, South Park did it to like,\n\n11:44.980 --> 11:46.700\nno, South Park's going to do it.\n\n11:46.700 --> 11:47.740\nDon't do it.\n\n11:47.740 --> 11:50.020\nBut anyways, the guy.\n\n11:50.020 --> 11:52.620\nSo he tries to bond with you about hating these things?\n\n11:52.620 --> 11:55.140\nIn the time it takes him to finish saying all that,\n\n11:55.140 --> 11:59.020\nit's like, back time the edit so that he finishes it\n\n11:59.020 --> 12:03.020\nin my face, which is weird.\n\n12:03.020 --> 12:06.420\nHe starts talking and says, take him out of the city dump.\n\n12:06.420 --> 12:07.220\nAnd now he's here.\n\n12:07.220 --> 12:10.460\nAnd I'm like, hi.\n\n12:10.460 --> 12:14.780\nAnd before I can ask the question, which I'm not going to,\n\n12:14.780 --> 12:19.180\nwell, here's what I did say, because I'm like, I went,\n\n12:19.180 --> 12:25.140\nwell, make sure you do that after this thing saves my bacon.\n\n12:25.140 --> 12:25.820\nWhat?\n\n12:25.820 --> 12:26.820\nHell yeah.\n\n12:26.820 --> 12:29.260\nAnd I said, well, I'm late for a meeting,\n\n12:29.260 --> 12:31.220\nand I'm kind of mumbling in the stammering,\n\n12:31.220 --> 12:32.500\nand I'm not making eye contact.\n\n12:32.500 --> 12:36.980\nThis guy's clearly like, he's got to be either.\n\n12:36.980 --> 12:44.060\nI'm thinking, grip, possibly key.\n\n12:44.060 --> 12:47.500\nWell, he had the authority of a key grip.\n\n12:47.500 --> 12:50.140\nHe might have been best boy.\n\n12:50.140 --> 12:50.640\nOh, boy.\n\n12:54.140 --> 12:56.940\nHe had an alpha fucking energy, a wallet chain,\n\n12:56.940 --> 13:01.980\nlike eye contact, like eye fucking looking at shit\n\n13:01.980 --> 13:04.980\nthat doesn't want to look at him, like eye contact\n\n13:04.980 --> 13:06.540\nwith everything, especially me.\n\n13:06.540 --> 13:07.460\nWho wants to look at me?\n\n13:07.460 --> 13:08.380\nSomeone look at me.\n\n13:08.380 --> 13:10.220\nI got shit to do.\n\n13:10.220 --> 13:13.460\nAnd I mean, the guy that's going to save my life\n\n13:13.460 --> 13:16.140\nand steal Cody when the zombies come, you know?\n\n13:16.140 --> 13:18.140\nBut he crossed the street to engage with you\n\n13:18.140 --> 13:20.060\nabout this particular thing.\n\n13:20.060 --> 13:23.780\nYeah, I mean, he was kind of like walking in a way\n\n13:23.780 --> 13:27.380\nthat he was just patrolling the neighborhood\n\n13:27.380 --> 13:32.660\nwith his little clangy chain, and so then he said,\n\n13:32.660 --> 13:34.700\nthat's something to talk about, someone to interact with.\n\n13:34.700 --> 13:35.820\nHe's like, let's be neighbors.\n\n13:35.820 --> 13:37.940\nAnd he starts shouting this thing at me.\n\n13:37.940 --> 13:40.940\nSo then I go, he doesn't understand because I'm\n\n13:40.940 --> 13:41.900\nstammering and mumbling.\n\n13:41.900 --> 13:45.020\nI'm like, well, I just, I want to try it out.\n\n13:48.020 --> 13:50.860\nBut then he doesn't really seem to hear that, which is fine.\n\n13:50.860 --> 13:52.060\nI don't fault him that.\n\n13:52.060 --> 13:53.060\nI'm not a good communicator.\n\n13:53.060 --> 13:55.860\nAnd then he's like, but the question in my head\n\n13:55.860 --> 13:59.580\nwas like, what's your proposed beef?\n\n13:59.580 --> 14:01.420\nLike, what is it, an eyesore?\n\n14:01.420 --> 14:02.620\nYou're wearing a wallet chain.\n\n14:06.420 --> 14:09.620\nWhat is the fucking beef is what I want to know?\n\n14:09.620 --> 14:11.700\nAnd I hadn't read any news about it and stuff like that.\n\n14:11.700 --> 14:17.580\nBut he goes, people are getting on these fucking things drunk\n\n14:17.580 --> 14:21.020\nand they're bashing their heads open.\n\n14:21.020 --> 14:26.100\nI wanted to say, I didn't say this, but I'm like, oh, oh,\n\n14:26.100 --> 14:29.260\nyou're a humanitarian.\n\n14:29.260 --> 14:31.980\nYou love people.\n\n14:31.980 --> 14:34.380\nYour beef with the scooters is that you\n\n14:34.380 --> 14:38.420\nhope more people that ride scooters,\n\n14:38.420 --> 14:41.660\nor you wish that they just had long, happy lives, which\n\n14:41.660 --> 14:43.620\nis going to be exemplified by his next statement,\n\n14:43.620 --> 14:45.340\nbecause then he finally takes in that I'm like,\n\n14:45.340 --> 14:48.340\nI got my credit card out and I'm trying to do this thing.\n\n14:48.340 --> 14:49.820\nAnd he goes, and I wrote it down.\n\n14:49.820 --> 14:53.700\nHe literally said, he said, you're not\n\n14:53.700 --> 14:58.180\ngoing to ride that fucking thing, are you?\n\n14:58.180 --> 15:03.900\nAnd I said, yeah, I'm going to try.\n\n15:03.900 --> 15:07.860\nAnd he was like, and he walked away.\n\n15:07.860 --> 15:09.980\nAnd then I never, I got to the point,\n\n15:09.980 --> 15:11.820\nI had scanned my driver's license.\n\n15:11.820 --> 15:13.500\nI had scanned, you know, it's dark out.\n\n15:13.500 --> 15:16.060\nAnd it took me like eight minutes.\n\n15:16.060 --> 15:17.540\nI was like, damn it.\n\n15:17.540 --> 15:19.140\nYou could have walked there.\n\n15:19.140 --> 15:20.580\nI got to that point where I was like,\n\n15:20.580 --> 15:21.980\nat this point, you could have walked there.\n\n15:21.980 --> 15:23.860\nSo now, are you an idiot if you keep going,\n\n15:23.860 --> 15:24.900\nor are you an idiot if you stop?\n\n15:24.900 --> 15:26.780\nAnd I just, it asked for a credit card.\n\n15:26.780 --> 15:28.260\nAnd I was like, I'm Audi.\n\n15:28.260 --> 15:29.300\nThat's what the kids say.\n\n15:29.300 --> 15:32.620\nThey add a Y to the out.\n\n15:32.620 --> 15:33.900\nThey don't say that anymore.\n\n15:33.900 --> 15:35.180\nSometimes they say Audi.\n\n15:35.180 --> 15:36.260\nAudi 5,000.\n\n15:36.260 --> 15:39.580\nThat's a reference to the Audi 5,000 automobile.\n\n15:39.580 --> 15:42.580\nIt's a very modern car.\n\n15:42.580 --> 15:45.940\nAnother thing they'll say is it's like a G6.\n\n15:45.940 --> 15:48.540\nSomething will be like a G6.\n\n15:48.540 --> 15:52.700\nThat means it's like an airplane.\n\n15:52.700 --> 15:54.980\nThat's Fergie.\n\n15:54.980 --> 15:56.140\nYou could be Audi 5,000.\n\n15:56.140 --> 15:57.500\nYou could be like a G6.\n\n15:57.500 --> 15:59.860\nDan, did you ever get on the vehicle?\n\n15:59.860 --> 16:00.620\nNo, I did not.\n\n16:00.620 --> 16:01.660\nI gave up and I walked.\n\n16:01.660 --> 16:02.580\nBecause it asked for a credit card.\n\n16:02.580 --> 16:04.460\nI was like, my driver's license was hard enough.\n\n16:04.460 --> 16:07.540\nAnd that's got a barcode on it that it could scan.\n\n16:07.540 --> 16:08.420\nIt was dusk.\n\n16:08.420 --> 16:10.860\nIt was not having a, my phone was not\n\n16:10.860 --> 16:12.340\nhaving a good time scanning stuff.\n\n16:12.340 --> 16:13.500\nI quit while I was ahead.\n\n16:13.500 --> 16:15.860\nPlus, the thing, and this is the thing that I have.\n\n16:15.860 --> 16:19.100\nSo if that is your beef, the head injury thing.\n\n16:19.100 --> 16:21.500\nSo apparently then I go meet my friends at dinner.\n\n16:21.500 --> 16:23.580\nAnd I'm like, oh, there's crazy guy in this beef\n\n16:23.580 --> 16:24.820\nthat people have with these scooters.\n\n16:24.820 --> 16:25.340\nWhat's the deal?\n\n16:25.340 --> 16:27.860\nTurns out all my friends have beef with these scooters.\n\n16:27.860 --> 16:29.300\nLike I'm just odd man out.\n\n16:29.300 --> 16:31.820\nNo one, because they're a hazard.\n\n16:31.820 --> 16:35.620\nLike people are, yes, you can go and you can hashtag this.\n\n16:35.620 --> 16:37.340\nAnd you can watch everybody.\n\n16:37.340 --> 16:40.900\nI just, the thing set, the reason why I really did give up\n\n16:40.900 --> 16:43.260\nis because it told me a thousand times,\n\n16:43.260 --> 16:45.300\nyou're supposed to be wearing a helmet.\n\n16:45.300 --> 16:47.700\nAnd I was just like, nobody wears a helmet.\n\n16:47.700 --> 16:48.420\nWas that a fucking thing?\n\n16:48.420 --> 16:51.020\nNo one wears a helmet on a bike, but it's also a good idea.\n\n16:51.020 --> 16:52.460\nI was kind of, I was worried.\n\n16:52.460 --> 16:53.980\nI wasn't really worried about being injured.\n\n16:53.980 --> 16:54.780\nI was actually worried.\n\n16:54.780 --> 16:56.580\nI was like, between that guy yelling,\n\n16:56.580 --> 16:59.420\nthis thing harping about helmets, I was like,\n\n16:59.420 --> 17:00.540\nit'll be just my luck.\n\n17:00.540 --> 17:02.620\nI'll get like pulled over.\n\n17:02.620 --> 17:06.500\nLike a community outreach cop program\n\n17:06.500 --> 17:08.060\nwill be like, you know.\n\n17:08.060 --> 17:12.260\nThere must have been already DUIs on these e-scooters, right?\n\n17:12.260 --> 17:13.820\nSomebody has to 100.\n\n17:13.820 --> 17:14.940\nIt's the idea is that people are getting drunk\n\n17:14.940 --> 17:17.740\nand they're getting on them and they're getting head injuries.\n\n17:17.740 --> 17:20.180\nBut I'm not one of those people that's like,\n\n17:20.180 --> 17:22.420\nooh, that's the Darwin thing.\n\n17:22.420 --> 17:24.300\nBut I don't think people should get hurt.\n\n17:24.300 --> 17:25.460\nI don't want them to get hurt.\n\n17:25.460 --> 17:27.580\nI don't care how bad you are.\n\n17:27.580 --> 17:30.740\nI hope Hitler had a good day his last day\n\n17:30.740 --> 17:31.820\nbefore he killed himself.\n\n17:31.820 --> 17:34.100\nLike I wish he hadn't killed so many people,\n\n17:34.100 --> 17:36.820\nbut I also like I don't, I don't, I don't,\n\n17:36.820 --> 17:38.460\nI'm not a capital punishment guy.\n\n17:38.460 --> 17:40.740\nI don't think they, I don't want people to suffer.\n\n17:40.740 --> 17:42.140\nAll right, don't take that out of context.\n\n17:42.140 --> 17:45.380\nI mean, I hope Hitler had a good day.\n\n17:46.500 --> 17:49.940\nWait, what context should we take that in?\n\n17:49.940 --> 17:51.460\nI don't know, actually that could only help\n\n17:51.460 --> 17:53.100\nmy political numbers right now.\n\n17:53.100 --> 17:54.620\nI tell you, I tell you, I should,\n\n17:54.620 --> 17:56.420\nI should just get on the bandwagon\n\n17:56.420 --> 17:58.860\nthat's leaving the station, right?\n\n17:58.860 --> 18:00.060\nDo bandwagons leave stations?\n\n18:00.060 --> 18:00.900\nAll right, come on.\n\n18:00.900 --> 18:01.740\nWe get it.\n\n18:01.740 --> 18:04.180\nWe got a big show tonight.\n\n18:04.180 --> 18:07.620\nI'm just saying, like, isn't it, it's kind of weird.\n\n18:07.620 --> 18:08.980\nIt's like, like, like, like, people are,\n\n18:08.980 --> 18:12.060\nare you really mad about the people that you,\n\n18:12.060 --> 18:13.460\nit's like, pick a lane.\n\n18:13.460 --> 18:15.140\nLike, you're grousen about this thing.\n\n18:15.140 --> 18:17.260\nAre you, are you really, because you're worried,\n\n18:17.260 --> 18:18.620\nit kind of goes back to my, like,\n\n18:18.620 --> 18:19.980\nprobably the first episode of the show\n\n18:19.980 --> 18:21.940\nwhere I'm like, it's the shoe tying thing.\n\n18:21.940 --> 18:24.620\nI'm like, you don't really care if I trip and fall.\n\n18:24.620 --> 18:26.820\nYou're excited that my shoelaces are untied.\n\n18:26.820 --> 18:29.700\nIt's like your little, your little corner of the world.\n\n18:29.700 --> 18:31.780\nYeah, you see a shoelace untied.\n\n18:31.780 --> 18:33.700\nIt's like time for you to be empowered.\n\n18:33.700 --> 18:36.500\nI just, I just wish that, that people on the e-scooters\n\n18:36.500 --> 18:40.020\nlike, do what you want, but obey the regular laws.\n\n18:40.020 --> 18:40.860\nRight.\n\n18:40.860 --> 18:41.940\nLike, don't be on the fucking sidewalk\n\n18:41.940 --> 18:43.740\nand run me down as I walk out.\n\n18:43.740 --> 18:44.580\nThat was the other thing, yeah.\n\n18:44.580 --> 18:45.420\nThat's true of bikes, though, too.\n\n18:45.420 --> 18:47.100\nLike, there's tons of people who just blow through\n\n18:47.100 --> 18:48.780\nintersections on bikes and stuff.\n\n18:48.780 --> 18:50.220\nIt's like, well, that's kind of dangerous.\n\n18:50.220 --> 18:51.060\nI don't like that.\n\n18:51.060 --> 18:54.460\nThere was one kid, I wanted to murder this fucking kid.\n\n18:54.460 --> 18:55.300\nYeah.\n\n18:55.300 --> 18:56.140\nIt wasn't the scooter's fault,\n\n18:56.140 --> 18:57.420\nbut it was just perfect that he was on\n\n18:57.420 --> 18:58.260\none of these fucking things,\n\n18:58.260 --> 19:00.220\nand he did have a helmet on, dork.\n\n19:00.220 --> 19:03.340\nAnd, but he was at an intersection\n\n19:03.340 --> 19:05.460\nand he's driving in the street\n\n19:05.460 --> 19:06.780\non one of these scooters with a helmet on.\n\n19:06.780 --> 19:08.620\nSo he's by the book, baby.\n\n19:08.620 --> 19:12.060\nI wanted to murder him because he pulled up\n\n19:12.060 --> 19:14.100\nto the intersection and he's just,\n\n19:14.100 --> 19:17.940\nhe's directing traffic at a four-way intersection.\n\n19:17.940 --> 19:20.220\nAnd he keeps like, he's doing that thing\n\n19:20.220 --> 19:21.620\nwhere he's looking at me and like,\n\n19:21.620 --> 19:25.060\nbecause his hand movement isn't making my car move forward,\n\n19:25.060 --> 19:26.940\nwhich would have caused it to collide\n\n19:26.940 --> 19:30.020\nwith oncoming traffic because it's a fucking intersection.\n\n19:30.020 --> 19:32.980\nAnd he's only focused on the car he wants to move.\n\n19:32.980 --> 19:34.980\nLike he's trained for this.\n\n19:34.980 --> 19:36.780\nAnd he's just like getting pissed at me.\n\n19:36.780 --> 19:38.860\nAnd I'm like sealed in my car and I can't go,\n\n19:38.860 --> 19:43.180\nyou fucking asshole, you're trying to make me die.\n\n19:43.180 --> 19:44.780\nThis, you know, those people that they start,\n\n19:44.780 --> 19:47.300\nthey're like, they just have this nervous tick.\n\n19:47.300 --> 19:49.500\nThey get to a four-way stop and they're like,\n\n19:49.500 --> 19:53.100\nthey're like, like, all of a sudden they're the boss of you\n\n19:53.100 --> 19:55.740\nbecause like, they're like, oh yeah, you go, you go.\n\n19:55.740 --> 19:58.860\nAnd then you don't, you might have a reason to not go.\n\n19:58.860 --> 20:01.860\nLike there's sheep in front of you or something or a bike.\n\n20:01.860 --> 20:03.900\nAnd the person's not, he's only looking at you\n\n20:03.900 --> 20:05.340\nand they're like, I said, go.\n\n20:10.140 --> 20:12.140\nNo, no one can relate to that story.\n\n20:12.140 --> 20:13.340\nI can.\n\n20:13.340 --> 20:16.020\nYou have a bit of intersection, we're sheep crossing\n\n20:16.020 --> 20:17.540\nand people are mad.\n\n20:17.540 --> 20:18.860\nNo, that happens to me all the time.\n\n20:18.860 --> 20:20.140\nI think I do that sometimes,\n\n20:20.140 --> 20:22.820\nbut usually I clock it before like the second wave.\n\n20:22.820 --> 20:24.540\nI'm like, oh, there's someone I can't see.\n\n20:24.540 --> 20:25.380\nOkay, I'm done.\n\n20:25.380 --> 20:26.660\nI'd never take that baton.\n\n20:26.660 --> 20:27.500\nI'm not in charge.\n\n20:27.500 --> 20:29.580\nIt's like, why we go to the fucking driver's ed?\n\n20:29.580 --> 20:31.380\nLike what do we, you don't have to worry\n\n20:31.380 --> 20:33.420\nabout what other people are doing.\n\n20:33.420 --> 20:34.740\nWhat are you doing?\n\n20:34.740 --> 20:36.420\nLike waving your hand at me.\n\n20:36.420 --> 20:38.340\nI was in Tulsa, Oklahoma last weekend\n\n20:38.340 --> 20:41.460\nand it was like Kentucky Derby day.\n\n20:41.460 --> 20:42.420\nAre you even listening to me?\n\n20:42.420 --> 20:43.260\nYes.\n\n20:43.260 --> 20:44.100\nI'm kidding, I'm just kidding.\n\n20:44.100 --> 20:48.020\nI'm expounding upon your thesis here.\n\n20:48.020 --> 20:51.500\nThere was people that were going to watch the Kentucky Derby\n\n20:51.500 --> 20:54.180\nand they were drunk and they were all on e-scooters\n\n20:54.180 --> 20:55.340\naround Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\n20:55.340 --> 20:57.460\nAnd everybody was fucking shit canned.\n\n20:57.460 --> 20:58.860\nAnd it was just a bunch of people\n\n20:58.860 --> 21:01.620\nthat shouldn't have been driving on an e-scooter drunk.\n\n21:01.620 --> 21:04.660\nAnd I was like, I'm going to watch somebody get murdered\n\n21:04.660 --> 21:07.140\nby a moving like SUV.\n\n21:07.140 --> 21:08.300\nThat could be fun though.\n\n21:09.540 --> 21:11.820\nThe only argument I understand is like what people say\n\n21:11.820 --> 21:15.380\nabout like motorcycles or like driving without insurance.\n\n21:15.380 --> 21:18.620\nLike it's like you, it's the,\n\n21:18.620 --> 21:20.420\neven if it's just you getting injured,\n\n21:20.420 --> 21:22.980\nlike you can fuck up the lives of people around you\n\n21:22.980 --> 21:24.020\nby getting injured.\n\n21:24.020 --> 21:26.460\nI mean, it's like, but that's kind of like,\n\n21:26.460 --> 21:27.780\nlike really that's your reasoning.\n\n21:27.780 --> 21:30.980\nLike, you know, like about like why things need to be,\n\n21:30.980 --> 21:33.580\nlike why you're really concerned about this prayer.\n\n21:33.580 --> 21:34.620\nOh, they're not wearing a helmet.\n\n21:34.620 --> 21:36.980\nSo if I hit them, I'll be guilty of murder\n\n21:36.980 --> 21:40.100\ninstead of injuring them.\n\n21:40.100 --> 21:40.980\nWhat are the rules?\n\n21:40.980 --> 21:44.940\nLike if you go and you see like a bird or a lime\n\n21:44.940 --> 21:47.780\nor whatever the fuck the scooters are and you go see one,\n\n21:47.780 --> 21:50.020\nlet's say you're 14 years old\n\n21:50.020 --> 21:52.780\nand you have your mother's credit card, you can write it.\n\n21:52.780 --> 21:55.220\nI think you gotta be 18, but I'm not sure.\n\n21:55.220 --> 21:57.220\nI mean, I'm sure you gotta have a credit card\n\n21:57.220 --> 21:58.460\nand I'm sure I probably,\n\n21:58.460 --> 22:00.420\nthey would be smart to say you gotta be 18.\n\n22:00.420 --> 22:02.420\nI mean, you know, the kids, they got these things,\n\n22:02.420 --> 22:04.220\nthey're called skateboards.\n\n22:04.220 --> 22:05.620\nI mean, if you're really,\n\n22:05.620 --> 22:07.220\nthat's the thing that's bumming you out\n\n22:07.220 --> 22:08.700\nis like the potential for injury.\n\n22:08.700 --> 22:10.340\nYou know, these kids are a really,\n\n22:10.340 --> 22:11.700\nthey're up to no good.\n\n22:11.700 --> 22:14.620\nLike they've got all kinds of shit with wheels on it.\n\n22:14.620 --> 22:16.980\nYeah, I saw a little girl the other day,\n\n22:16.980 --> 22:20.460\nshe had two tiny skateboards on her feet.\n\n22:20.460 --> 22:22.460\nShe's just licking a lollipop,\n\n22:22.460 --> 22:25.820\nwhoa, whoa, whoa, like rolling around.\n\n22:25.820 --> 22:28.060\nI'm like, I pulled over, I'm like,\n\n22:28.060 --> 22:29.900\nyou piece of fucking shit.\n\n22:29.900 --> 22:31.940\nI'd like to cut your fucking feet off\n\n22:31.940 --> 22:33.780\nand take them to the city dump.\n\n22:36.340 --> 22:37.460\nOur next guest.\n\n22:40.460 --> 22:42.460\nThese guys, I just laid eyes on them\n\n22:42.460 --> 22:43.460\nfor the first time backstage.\n\n22:43.460 --> 22:46.060\nThey're so handsome for podcasters.\n\n22:47.060 --> 22:49.460\nThey're really intimidating, like,\n\n22:49.460 --> 22:51.460\nintimidatingly good-looking.\n\n22:52.460 --> 22:53.460\nWell, let's bring them out.\n\n22:53.460 --> 22:54.460\nOkay.\n\n22:54.460 --> 22:57.460\nPlease welcome Sean and Hayes from the Hollywood Handbook.\n\n23:03.460 --> 23:05.460\nThere's Sean, there's Hayes.\n\n23:08.460 --> 23:10.460\nYou guys agree that your hands are wherever.\n\n23:11.460 --> 23:12.460\nThat's very kind.\n\n23:12.460 --> 23:14.460\nThat is so nice. Thank you, Dan.\n\n23:14.460 --> 23:18.460\nFour podcasters is a good qualification to put on, you know?\n\n23:18.460 --> 23:19.460\nYou know, I mean.\n\n23:21.460 --> 23:22.460\nBut otherwise, I'd agree.\n\n23:22.460 --> 23:23.460\nAll right, or anything.\n\n23:23.460 --> 23:25.460\nYou guys are cute as buttons.\n\n23:25.460 --> 23:27.460\nActors are podcasting now, though, Dan.\n\n23:27.460 --> 23:28.460\nI know.\n\n23:28.460 --> 23:30.460\nAnna Farris has a podcast.\n\n23:30.460 --> 23:32.460\nWe got to get away from this idea\n\n23:32.460 --> 23:34.460\nthat it's just for the misfits anymore.\n\n23:36.460 --> 23:37.460\nThese guys are moving in.\n\n23:37.460 --> 23:39.460\nI got to stop, right?\n\n23:40.460 --> 23:43.460\nIt is turned into just mainstream.\n\n23:44.460 --> 23:45.460\nI'm not welcome here.\n\n23:45.460 --> 23:47.460\nDan, if I may, actually,\n\n23:47.460 --> 23:49.460\nI could kind of tie two things together here\n\n23:49.460 --> 23:51.460\nbecause you were talking about Hayes being handsome\n\n23:51.460 --> 23:53.460\nand you were talking about scooters a lot,\n\n23:53.460 --> 23:57.460\nand he actually has been known around town lately\n\n23:57.460 --> 24:01.460\nas the Scooty Cutie, and he does wear a helmet.\n\n24:01.460 --> 24:02.460\nI do wear a helmet.\n\n24:02.460 --> 24:04.460\nI scoot all over the place.\n\n24:04.460 --> 24:05.460\nI scooted here.\n\n24:05.460 --> 24:07.460\nWe were talking about it backstage,\n\n24:07.460 --> 24:10.460\nand I am sort of becoming known as the Scooty Cutie.\n\n24:10.460 --> 24:13.460\nWho has called you the Scooty Cutie?\n\n24:13.460 --> 24:15.460\nPeople yelling from their cars.\n\n24:15.460 --> 24:17.460\nI make sense to you.\n\n24:17.460 --> 24:19.460\nYou'll be scooting down the road,\n\n24:19.460 --> 24:21.460\nand someone will go like, hey, Scooty Cutie.\n\n24:21.460 --> 24:22.460\nThere goes a Scooty Cutie.\n\n24:22.460 --> 24:24.460\nYou look like kind of a doppler.\n\n24:24.460 --> 24:26.460\nHoney, that's the Scooty Cutie.\n\n24:26.460 --> 24:29.460\nAre you making that up, or is it an actual thing?\n\n24:29.460 --> 24:30.460\nI think it's a Scooty Cutie.\n\n24:30.460 --> 24:32.460\nIt's hard to hear exactly what they're saying,\n\n24:32.460 --> 24:36.460\nbut you've chosen to hear a Scooty Cutie.\n\n24:36.460 --> 24:39.460\nThat has been one interpretation of it, yeah.\n\n24:39.460 --> 24:42.460\nSean also has started scooting a little bit,\n\n24:42.460 --> 24:47.460\nand he also has a name, which is the Lime Arita.\n\n24:47.460 --> 24:49.460\nYeah, I only use the Lime Scooters,\n\n24:49.460 --> 24:53.460\nand if I'm guilty of anything, it's being a little too sweet.\n\n24:53.460 --> 24:55.460\nThat's your Scooting style?\n\n24:55.460 --> 24:56.460\nIt's a little too...\n\n24:56.460 --> 24:58.460\nIt's a touch sweet.\n\n24:58.460 --> 25:01.460\nA little more triple sec than was necessary.\n\n25:01.460 --> 25:03.460\nThat's right.\n\n25:03.460 --> 25:05.460\nDo you want to hear a horrible thing,\n\n25:05.460 --> 25:07.460\na Scooter story that happened on the way here?\n\n25:07.460 --> 25:08.460\nYes, we fucking do.\n\n25:08.460 --> 25:13.460\nI was riding on the sidewalk, which you have to do in a lot of parts of the city.\n\n25:13.460 --> 25:15.460\nThis is just way too dangerous to be in the street.\n\n25:15.460 --> 25:18.460\nAnd I was coming up on...\n\n25:18.460 --> 25:20.460\nCitizen's arrest.\n\n25:20.460 --> 25:28.460\nApproaching me were an older couple pushing a shopping cart full of cans,\n\n25:28.460 --> 25:32.460\nand I start to move into the street, but it is way too late.\n\n25:32.460 --> 25:37.460\nThey are fully taking their shopping cart and moving it out of the way\n\n25:37.460 --> 25:40.460\nso that I can pass on my Scooter.\n\n25:40.460 --> 25:42.460\nAnd I thought, I'm never taking this again.\n\n25:42.460 --> 25:43.460\nThis is not fair.\n\n25:43.460 --> 25:45.460\nI'm taking up too much sidewalk space.\n\n25:45.460 --> 25:47.460\nBut then I had an epiphany,\n\n25:47.460 --> 25:51.460\nwhich is that me and these guys should team up against the cars.\n\n25:51.460 --> 25:54.460\nAnd we should take over the street.\n\n25:54.460 --> 25:57.460\nThose are the real enemies, are the cars.\n\n25:57.460 --> 25:59.460\nYou're supposed to be on the street.\n\n25:59.460 --> 26:01.460\nYou're not supposed to use those on the side.\n\n26:01.460 --> 26:03.460\nWhich is why Citizen's Arrest.\n\n26:03.460 --> 26:07.460\nYou broke the law, you confessed, it's recorded.\n\n26:07.460 --> 26:10.460\nThey're also not supposed to have a shopping cart.\n\n26:10.460 --> 26:11.460\nExactly.\n\n26:11.460 --> 26:13.460\nSo we ended up arresting each other?\n\n26:13.460 --> 26:15.460\nYes, we're finally punching up.\n\n26:15.460 --> 26:17.460\nLet's get the guys with the shopping carts.\n\n26:17.460 --> 26:19.460\nFinally punching up.\n\n26:24.460 --> 26:27.460\nIt is so hard for me to punch up these days.\n\n26:27.460 --> 26:32.460\nI found out a way to punch down without getting called out for it though\n\n26:32.460 --> 26:34.460\nbecause I was telling you guys backstage,\n\n26:34.460 --> 26:36.460\nI feel like the next door app.\n\n26:36.460 --> 26:39.460\nI was looking through my next door app thing\n\n26:39.460 --> 26:41.460\nand I was like, I think you can humiliate these people\n\n26:41.460 --> 26:46.460\nwithout punching down because they are loud and proud about it.\n\n26:46.460 --> 26:48.460\nThey want people to know.\n\n26:48.460 --> 26:50.460\nIf they could, they would make the world know\n\n26:50.460 --> 26:52.460\nthat someone pooped without cleaning it up\n\n26:52.460 --> 26:54.460\noutside their apartment or whatever.\n\n26:54.460 --> 26:58.460\nI don't think people would be like, oh, you're punching down\n\n26:58.460 --> 27:00.460\nby reading their posts out loud.\n\n27:00.460 --> 27:02.460\nYeah, they're property owners.\n\n27:02.460 --> 27:05.460\nIt's open season on the next door people.\n\n27:09.460 --> 27:12.460\nLet's see, how does your phone work?\n\n27:12.460 --> 27:16.460\nWho I see sometimes on the next door in my neighborhood is a sclar.\n\n27:16.460 --> 27:17.460\nOkay.\n\n27:17.460 --> 27:19.460\nI won't say which one.\n\n27:20.460 --> 27:22.460\nHere's one that's adorable.\n\n27:22.460 --> 27:24.460\nI've known them forever.\n\n27:24.460 --> 27:26.460\nI can only remember one of their names at one time.\n\n27:26.460 --> 27:28.460\nWhich one is it right now?\n\n27:29.460 --> 27:30.460\nRandy.\n\n27:30.460 --> 27:31.460\nYeah, Randy.\n\n27:31.460 --> 27:32.460\nYeah, that's mine too.\n\n27:32.460 --> 27:34.460\nYeah, but then the next time it's the other guy.\n\n27:34.460 --> 27:35.460\nYeah.\n\n27:35.460 --> 27:38.460\nI mean, what's the reward for learning both sclar names?\n\n27:38.460 --> 27:40.460\nYou can't tell them apart.\n\n27:40.460 --> 27:42.460\nOne of them is Eugene.\n\n27:42.460 --> 27:44.460\nThat gets you nowhere.\n\n27:44.460 --> 27:47.460\nYou would never approach them and be like Randy, Jason.\n\n27:47.460 --> 27:49.460\nYou just say like, hey guys.\n\n27:49.460 --> 27:51.460\nI mean, this one,\n\n27:53.460 --> 27:56.460\nmy 19-year-old son needs a summer job.\n\n27:57.460 --> 27:59.460\nI just thought that was kind of cute.\n\n28:00.460 --> 28:03.460\nAs a true crime listener, I just felt like,\n\n28:04.460 --> 28:06.460\nAnd they're out early on it as well.\n\n28:07.460 --> 28:08.460\nThey're getting a jump start.\n\n28:08.460 --> 28:09.460\nYeah, it's May.\n\n28:09.460 --> 28:12.460\nI know, it's like does that son want that?\n\n28:13.460 --> 28:15.460\nThis is sort of like a pull.\n\n28:16.460 --> 28:18.460\nI read this one, this person.\n\n28:18.460 --> 28:20.460\nSo this person has this security camera footage\n\n28:20.460 --> 28:22.460\nthat they've posted here in Nextdoor.\n\n28:22.460 --> 28:23.460\nAnd it says,\n\n28:23.460 --> 28:25.460\nneighbor leaving dog poop behind,\n\n28:25.460 --> 28:27.460\nfollowed by a hair flip.\n\n28:30.460 --> 28:32.460\nHello, neighbors.\n\n28:32.460 --> 28:34.460\nHad to post this video of someone in the neighborhood\n\n28:34.460 --> 28:36.460\nwho watches her pit bull take a massive poop,\n\n28:36.460 --> 28:38.460\nthen doesn't even attempt to pick it up,\n\n28:38.460 --> 28:40.460\ndoes a hair flip,\n\n28:40.460 --> 28:42.460\nand then appears to reward her dog.\n\n28:42.460 --> 28:43.460\nIt's true.\n\n28:43.460 --> 28:45.460\nOnly to leave me to clean up her dog's mess.\n\n28:45.460 --> 28:47.460\nIf anyone knows this,\n\n28:47.460 --> 28:49.460\nhere's the thing about it.\n\n28:49.460 --> 28:51.460\nYou're posting surveillance footage\n\n28:51.460 --> 28:53.460\nfrom a public sidewalk,\n\n28:53.460 --> 28:56.460\nand I'm not saying that that should be illegal.\n\n28:56.460 --> 28:59.460\nBut on the hierarchy of shame,\n\n28:59.460 --> 29:01.460\nif I was doing this,\n\n29:01.460 --> 29:03.460\nmaybe it's a generational thing,\n\n29:03.460 --> 29:04.460\nbut I would be like,\n\n29:06.460 --> 29:09.460\nby the way, I have a fucking camera on the sidewalk,\n\n29:10.460 --> 29:12.460\nbecause someone punched me once.\n\n29:12.460 --> 29:14.460\nI would try to,\n\n29:14.460 --> 29:17.460\nbecause I feel like surveilling people\n\n29:17.460 --> 29:18.460\nis next door.\n\n29:18.460 --> 29:20.460\nYou don't have to explain.\n\n29:20.460 --> 29:21.460\nI know.\n\n29:22.460 --> 29:23.460\nThe person is like,\n\n29:23.460 --> 29:25.460\nthank God I'm surveilling,\n\n29:25.460 --> 29:27.460\nbecause now I can put this person on.\n\n29:29.460 --> 29:32.460\nThe next logical step would be that someone would be like,\n\n29:32.460 --> 29:34.460\nhey, I put a camera in my bathroom\n\n29:34.460 --> 29:36.460\nduring a party I was throwing.\n\n29:36.460 --> 29:38.460\nCheck out this guy didn't wash his hands.\n\n29:38.460 --> 29:40.460\nYou'd be like, but you shouldn't have...\n\n29:40.460 --> 29:42.460\nWhy was there a camera in the bathroom?\n\n29:42.460 --> 29:44.460\nBecause in this neighborhood,\n\n29:44.460 --> 29:46.460\nI'm like the Vlad the Impaler.\n\n29:46.460 --> 29:49.460\nI live in this big house overlooking

38:47.460\nand doesn't appear to have like a light\n\n38:47.460 --> 38:49.460\nor water and like\n\n38:49.460 --> 38:51.460\npause at the outside.\n\n38:51.460 --> 38:53.460\nI almost feel like there's one in every neighborhood\n\n38:53.460 --> 38:55.460\nthat just people that don't like their culture\n\n38:55.460 --> 38:57.460\nis like junkyard dog.\n\n38:57.460 --> 38:59.460\nI think that's right.\n\n38:59.460 --> 39:01.460\nThey're just like, well, that's a guard dog.\n\n39:01.460 --> 39:03.460\nWhich means like we don't feed it\n\n39:03.460 --> 39:05.460\nbecause we want to keep it mean basically.\n\n39:05.460 --> 39:07.460\nAnd there's not\n\n39:07.460 --> 39:09.460\na lot to do.\n\n39:09.460 --> 39:11.460\nYou could certainly post on next door,\n\n39:11.460 --> 39:13.460\nbut I think\n\n39:13.460 --> 39:15.460\nwhat your friend found is what\n\n39:15.460 --> 39:17.460\nit's going to be people saying call animal control,\n\n39:17.460 --> 39:19.460\ncall animal control is going to say where you\n\n39:19.460 --> 39:21.460\nyou're basically\n\n39:21.460 --> 39:23.460\nthey're going to say suck a dick.\n\n39:23.460 --> 39:25.460\nTheir response is ultimately vulgar\n\n39:25.460 --> 39:27.460\nbecause there's\n\n39:27.460 --> 39:29.460\nthere's not much that you could do.\n\n39:29.460 --> 39:31.460\nSo, yeah, yeah, that's okay.\n\n39:31.460 --> 39:33.460\nThat's my next door app segment.\n\n39:33.460 --> 39:35.460\nThanks for joining me on it.\n\n39:35.460 --> 39:37.460\nYou must have had to avoid\n\n39:37.460 --> 39:39.460\nall the posts of people saying\n\n39:39.460 --> 39:41.460\nlike a Latino guy looked at my house.\n\n39:41.460 --> 39:43.460\nYeah, casing, casing.\n\n39:43.460 --> 39:45.460\nIs there a number that's more urgent\n\n39:45.460 --> 39:47.460\nthan 911?\n\n39:47.460 --> 39:49.460\nI mean,\n\n39:49.460 --> 39:51.460\nif the guy with the wallet chain\n\n39:51.460 --> 39:53.460\nthat yelled at the scooter, if he was brown,\n\n39:53.460 --> 39:55.460\nhe would have been casing my house\n\n39:55.460 --> 39:57.460\non next door app.\n\n39:57.460 --> 39:59.460\nI'm thinking around the neighborhood doing anything\n\n39:59.460 --> 40:01.460\nother than hauling in\n\n40:01.460 --> 40:03.460\ncartoon groceries with a baguette sticking out the top\n\n40:03.460 --> 40:05.460\nfor that, you know,\n\n40:05.460 --> 40:07.460\nCaucasian supplies\n\n40:07.460 --> 40:09.460\nlabeled on the bag.\n\n40:09.460 --> 40:11.460\nUh,\n\n40:11.460 --> 40:13.460\nhere's some here's pink and blue paint\n\n40:13.460 --> 40:15.460\nfor the nursery and some baguettes.\n\n40:15.460 --> 40:17.460\nUm,\n\n40:17.460 --> 40:19.460\nI'm the first activist even King novel.\n\n40:19.460 --> 40:21.460\nUh,\n\n40:21.460 --> 40:23.460\neveryone else is casing, casing, casing, casing.\n\n40:23.460 --> 40:25.460\nThere's the top post on mine\n\n40:25.460 --> 40:27.460\ntoday is\n\n40:27.460 --> 40:29.460\nshady character.\n\n40:29.460 --> 40:31.460\nYeah.\n\n40:31.460 --> 40:33.460\nIt's just like there's a shady character.\n\n40:33.460 --> 40:35.460\nThey should use something more tasteful\n\n40:35.460 --> 40:37.460\nlike spooky or smoky.\n\n40:39.460 --> 40:41.460\nCan we cut my laugh on that?\n\n40:47.460 --> 40:49.460\nI got mad at you for a second,\n\n40:49.460 --> 40:51.460\nbut I'm like, what reward for solidarity?\n\n40:51.460 --> 40:53.460\nGo on without me.\n\n40:53.460 --> 40:55.460\nSurvive, survive my young man.\n\n40:55.460 --> 40:57.460\nMost people listening won't know which one\n\n40:57.460 --> 40:59.460\nthat was.\n\n40:59.460 --> 41:01.460\nI think we're okay.\n\n41:01.460 --> 41:03.460\nYeah, so Hollywood.\n\n41:03.460 --> 41:05.460\nOh boy.\n\n41:05.460 --> 41:07.460\nYou guys have this podcast, the Hollywood Handbook.\n\n41:07.460 --> 41:09.460\nI've been listening to a couple episodes.\n\n41:09.460 --> 41:11.460\nYour roster of guests is impressive.\n\n41:11.460 --> 41:13.460\nIt's Ear Wolf, so, you know,\n\n41:13.460 --> 41:15.460\nyou guys just hoard all of the\n\n41:15.460 --> 41:17.460\nguests.\n\n41:17.460 --> 41:19.460\nYeah, I wish there were more stuff\n\n41:19.460 --> 41:21.460\nto say about our show.\n\n41:21.460 --> 41:23.460\nThere isn't a ton.\n\n41:23.460 --> 41:25.460\nThank you for everyone who clapped\n\n41:25.460 --> 41:27.460\nwho\n\n41:27.460 --> 41:29.460\nsaid that they were here.\n\n41:29.460 --> 41:31.460\nWe're aware of us.\n\n41:31.460 --> 41:33.460\nIt's very funny.\n\n41:33.460 --> 41:35.460\nThank you.\n\n41:35.460 --> 41:37.460\nEveryone who didn't,\n\n41:37.460 --> 41:39.460\nyou can't just clap\n\n41:39.460 --> 41:41.460\nlike,\n\n41:41.460 --> 41:43.460\nwe can hear you.\n\n41:43.460 --> 41:45.460\nWe're right back there.\n\n41:45.460 --> 41:47.460\nI'm holding that.\n\n41:47.460 --> 41:49.460\nWhat is the format of Hollywood Handbook?\n\n41:49.460 --> 41:51.460\nWhat do you say when people ask you\n\n41:51.460 --> 41:53.460\nwhat's the format of this show?\n\n41:53.460 --> 41:55.460\nIt's pretty simple.\n\n41:55.460 --> 41:57.460\nDan pours himself a hefty flag in the vodka.\n\n41:59.460 --> 42:01.460\nHayes, I think,\n\n42:01.460 --> 42:03.460\nhas characterized the show well.\n\n42:03.460 --> 42:05.460\nIt is mostly funny comments.\n\n42:09.460 --> 42:11.460\nBut the...\n\n42:11.460 --> 42:13.460\nWalk me through it, because I'm new to the game.\n\n42:13.460 --> 42:15.460\nYou start a show and what...\n\n42:15.460 --> 42:17.460\nWe...\n\n42:17.460 --> 42:19.460\nThis will be good for anyone\n\n42:19.460 --> 42:21.460\nwho wants to try to listen to one.\n\n42:21.460 --> 42:23.460\nWe can give an example.\n\n42:23.460 --> 42:25.460\nTim Heidecker was on the show recently.\n\n42:25.460 --> 42:27.460\nThank you for listening to two episodes.\n\n42:27.460 --> 42:29.460\nHe came on and told us that he did not\n\n42:29.460 --> 42:31.460\nget through the first ad,\n\n42:31.460 --> 42:33.460\nwhich was seven minutes long.\n\n42:33.460 --> 42:35.460\nSo there are a couple barriers to entry.\n\n42:35.460 --> 42:37.460\nWe've been told that the show takes\n\n42:37.460 --> 42:39.460\n15 to 20 episodes to get into.\n\n42:39.460 --> 42:41.460\nI think I said that.\n\n42:41.460 --> 42:43.460\nSomeone said it's an acquired taste,\n\n42:43.460 --> 42:45.460\nwhich I was never gonna...\n\n42:45.460 --> 42:47.460\nIt sounds like I'll get along with them.\n\n42:47.460 --> 42:49.460\nThat's gotta be what people say\n\n42:49.460 --> 42:51.460\nabout this podcast.\n\n42:51.460 --> 42:53.460\nIs there a game of an episode that we could...\n\n42:53.460 --> 42:55.460\nWhat's a good first...\n\n42:55.460 --> 42:57.460\nOrderve to enter into this world?\n\n42:57.460 --> 42:59.460\nYou said you listened to the Heather Anne Campbell one.\n\n42:59.460 --> 43:01.460\nI think that one is pretty good.\n\n43:01.460 --> 43:03.460\nHeather's fucking fantastic.\n\n43:03.460 --> 43:05.460\nBy the way, I acquired that taste instantly,\n\n43:05.460 --> 43:07.460\nwhich means it's not an acquired taste.\n\n43:07.460 --> 43:09.460\nYou guys are very funny and charming.\n\n43:11.460 --> 43:13.460\nSpencer's a big fan and was on there.\n\n43:13.460 --> 43:15.460\nSpencer, come on.\n\n43:15.460 --> 43:17.460\nI tell people that it's kind of like\n\n43:17.460 --> 43:19.460\npeople trying to improv.\n\n43:19.460 --> 43:21.460\nIt's like an improv sketch, but the sketches,\n\n43:21.460 --> 43:23.460\nthey're just having a conversation.\n\n43:23.460 --> 43:25.460\nThe worst conversation.\n\n43:25.460 --> 43:29.460\nWe're in character as two petty idiots.\n\n43:29.460 --> 43:31.460\nWhich is like one degree off\n\n43:31.460 --> 43:33.460\nfrom our actual personalities.\n\n43:33.460 --> 43:35.460\nHave you guys ever listened to\n\n43:35.460 --> 43:37.460\nPeter Cook and Dudley Moore\n\n43:37.460 --> 43:39.460\nor Clive and Derek?\n\n43:39.460 --> 43:41.460\nNo, I haven't.\n\n43:41.460 --> 43:43.460\nThey are saying it's my inspiration.\n\n43:43.460 --> 43:45.460\nYeah, they made these records\n\n43:45.460 --> 43:47.460\nwhere they just had studio time\n\n43:47.460 --> 43:49.460\nand they would just improvise\n\n43:49.460 --> 43:51.460\nand they made these records where it's just\n\n43:51.460 --> 43:53.460\nDudley Moore and Peter Cook\n\n43:53.460 --> 43:55.460\nfor me, the funniest improv of all time.\n\n43:55.460 --> 43:57.460\nBut it's just two assholes\n\n43:57.460 --> 43:59.460\ntalking as two fake characters\n\n43:59.460 --> 44:01.460\nnamed Derek and Clive.\n\n44:01.460 --> 44:03.460\nIt's really funny.\n\n44:03.460 --> 44:05.460\nSince you brought...\n\n44:05.460 --> 44:07.460\nI wasn't sure everyone's got a different philosophy.\n\n44:07.460 --> 44:09.460\nI didn't know if I was allowed to say\n\n44:09.460 --> 44:11.460\nthe characters...\n\n44:11.460 --> 44:13.460\nI don't know if you're like...\n\n44:13.460 --> 44:15.460\nYou don't break that spell.\n\n44:15.460 --> 44:17.460\nNo, we'd like a line drawn\n\n44:17.460 --> 44:19.460\nfor the back catalog stuff.\n\n44:19.460 --> 44:21.460\nIt kind of reminds me of...\n\n44:21.460 --> 44:23.460\nIt's like a less arch\n\n44:23.460 --> 44:25.460\nJiminy Glick.\n\n44:25.460 --> 44:27.460\nLike Martin Short doing Jiminy Glick.\n\n44:27.460 --> 44:29.460\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n44:29.460 --> 44:31.460\nYeah, we're not Martin Short.\n\n44:31.460 --> 44:33.460\nBut...\n\n44:33.460 --> 44:35.460\nYou guys are supposedly Hollywood insiders\n\n44:35.460 --> 44:37.460\nand you have guests on\n\n44:37.460 --> 44:39.460\nand the characters are clearly...\n\n44:39.460 --> 44:41.460\nYeah, they don't know what they're talking about.\n\n44:41.460 --> 44:43.460\nSo when Heather Anne Campbell,\n\n44:43.460 --> 44:45.460\nwho's one of my favorite improv heroes,\n\n44:45.460 --> 44:47.460\nshe came on...\n\n44:47.460 --> 44:49.460\nShe's playing herself\n\n44:49.460 --> 44:51.460\nand so she took\n\n44:51.460 --> 44:53.460\nthe strong choice to hate us\n\n44:53.460 --> 44:55.460\nfor the entire episode.\n\n44:55.460 --> 44:57.460\nBut we were asking her\n\n44:57.460 --> 44:59.460\nto do\n\n44:59.460 --> 45:01.460\nvoiceover for a video game\n\n45:01.460 --> 45:03.460\nthat we had designed.\n\n45:03.460 --> 45:05.460\nAnd so we're feeding her lines\n\n45:05.460 --> 45:07.460\nof what's happening in the game.\n\n45:07.460 --> 45:09.460\nIt was a video game adaptation\n\n45:09.460 --> 45:11.460\nof the Ryan Reynolds Sandra Bullock film,\n\n45:11.460 --> 45:13.460\nThe Proposal.\n\n45:13.460 --> 45:15.460\nBut...\n\n45:15.460 --> 45:17.460\nI think you guys are really smart\n\n45:17.460 --> 45:19.460\nbecause it occurred to me then\n\n45:19.460 --> 45:21.460\nbecause I was like, why did they...\n\n45:21.460 --> 45:23.460\nDid they just have that up their sleeve?\n\n45:23.460 --> 45:25.460\nI mean, that's fine.\n\n45:25.460 --> 45:27.460\nHave that in your iCloud, as my ex-wife would call it.\n\n45:27.460 --> 45:29.460\nI have like five things I'm pulling out that week.\n\n45:29.460 --> 45:31.460\nBut then I'm like, oh, no,\n\n45:31.460 -->

01:04:41.460\nit's Donal\n\n01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.460\nand also apparently Cody says we have to have him on the show\n\n01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.460\nbecause he's like amazing and really fun\n\n01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:47.460\nbut\n\n01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.460\nit got back\n\n01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.460\nto me that\n\n01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.460\nwhen he got approached for the

01:05:01.460\nwho asked Cody who repeated this to me\n\n01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.460\nbecause I guess she perceives me\n\n01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.460\nas a maid of tougher stuff\n\n01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.460\nI guess I've successfully tricked her\n\n01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.460\ninto thinking that I am\n\n01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:17.460\nsomehow self-actualized\n\n01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:19.460\nI guess\n\n01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.460\nby being on top of someone\n\n01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.460\nperfect and not\n\n01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.460\nconstantly opting

--> 01:26:01.460\nwhat the vocal melody would be\n\n01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.460\nbut holding these sustained notes\n\n01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:05.460\nFred's the guy that I\n\n01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.460\nassuming\n\n01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.460\nI was dreaming when I wrote this\n\n01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:11.460\nwhat's that song?\n\n01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.460\nI'm assuming Fred's the
