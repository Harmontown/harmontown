Wow.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:56.000\nThank you for coming out on a holiday weekend.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:59.000\nAlright, Jeff, we got a lot to do tonight.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:01.000\nLet's get down to business, Harmont.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:04.000\nOkay, so, society corner.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:07.000\nDo you want a theme for that, or no?\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:08.000\nDo you want to jump in?\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:09.000\nShe got one handy.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:10.000\nLet's do...\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:16.000\nSociety corner.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:21.000\nIt's some advice about how to run a society.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:24.000\nIt's a corner where that society lives.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:25.000\nSociety corner.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:26.000\nSociety corner time.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:29.000\nIt's about how to run a society.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:32.000\nHow to run a society where the society lives.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:34.000\nIt's called society corner.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:35.000\nCorner corner.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:36.000\nOkay.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:42.000\nYeah, we've got them training to expect less.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:44.000\nYou guys understand, the show is improvised.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nRight this shit.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:49.000\nI know it comes off like a highly polished gem,\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:53.000\nbut this is completely just off the cuff.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:55.000\nOkay, so...\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:58.000\nI'm making up no expressions.\n\n01:58.000 --> 01:59.000\nIt's off the shit.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:02.000\nSpencer, our Dungeon Master, came up with...\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:03.000\nand I were driving along.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.000\nSpencer is also my chauffeur.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:09.000\nHe's my Dungeon Master chauffeur and B-assistant,\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:13.000\nas opposed to A-assistant, not like apiary.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:14.000\nWait a minute.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:15.000\nIs that right?\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:16.000\nApiary?\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:17.000\nIs that B?\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:18.000\nOkay.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:23.000\nBut we came up with this when we were watching a fire truck drive by us.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nWe were talking about, okay, there's fire trucks.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:28.000\nWhat is it like to be a fireman?\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:33.000\nAnd they sit in that station and they wait for fire alarms.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nAnd a lot of times it's like somebody that's been hurt.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:39.000\nThey're the first response, often the paramedics on board.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:42.000\nIf somebody just loses a foot or something,\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:45.000\nnot on fire at all, they're the first there.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:48.000\nSo Spencer and I came up with a new pitch,\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nand if you're listening and you work for civic government,\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:53.000\nplease take this to heart.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:57.000\nFirefighters should leave for fires earlier\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:01.000\nby not getting dressed at the station.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:05.000\nThey should take their fire gear with them.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:08.000\nLeave the station earlier, thereby increasing chances\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:12.000\nof getting to a fire when it's smaller.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:15.000\nAnd if they need to get dressed, they can do it on site.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:19.000\nSame amount of time increased the chances of catching a fire when it's smaller.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nAnd of course, there's the people that lost a foot\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nand it's not on fire at all.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:24.000\nJust show up in a shirt and jeans.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:25.000\nTake care of it.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:26.000\nIs there a fire?\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nOh, let's put on our rubber pants.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:31.000\nNow, the taxpayers would appreciate a good show.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nOh, they're getting in their rubber pants.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nDon't do that in the station.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:36.000\nYou don't know where you're going.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:37.000\nYou don't know how big the fire is.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nGet the fire truck over to the fire.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:41.000\nIt might be tiny right now.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:43.000\nThat's a very good idea.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:46.000\nDo you think that when the dispatch comes out for a call\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:50.000\nand they go, hey, we got a guy, he has a broken foot,\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nthey don't get full fire gear, do they?\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:54.000\nI don't know.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nI don't know how it works, but there's room for improvement.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nIn my mind, because you see them driving to things\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nand there's the hook and ladder and there's a dude in the back.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:04.000\nHe has his pants on, but he has like a t-shirt on with the suspenders.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:07.000\nAnd you know what, they wear those, right?\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:10.000\nI think I've heard that.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:13.000\nBut yeah, I think it's a very sound idea.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nOkay.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nAll right, so I don't know if you want to spend time\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:18.000\non this bartender concept.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nWe were talking to the green room.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nWe brought it up.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nLast week we talked about, oh, wouldn't it be nice\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nto have what we're calling a bartender,\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:31.000\nbut that does not mean anything legally definable.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nWe're worried about the idea that it might be illegal\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nin some way for meltdown,\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nbut we're not going to have somebody up here\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nserving drinks to the audience\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nand being paid for that service,\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:45.000\nbecause that would be against the Alcohol Beverage Commission.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:47.000\nAlso, the person, and I'm not kidding about this,\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nthey wouldn't be handling liquor at all.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nThey could just be an ice tender.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:52.000\nIce tender?\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nYeah, they could just put ice in the cups.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nThere's only one booze up here.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nWho's going to pour the vodka?\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nNo, we would have the vodka.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nThe hard part is the ice.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nThe hard part is that it interrupts the show\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:06.000\nwhen people are putting microphones down\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nto deal with alcohol.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nIce. It's the ice.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nIt's easy to pour vodka into a cup.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nI've done it a thousand times.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nIt's hard to get the ice happening up here.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nWould we get in legal trouble if somebody was over here\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nmaking me a vodka on the rocks?\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nMaking you a vodka on the rocks?\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nThat I don't know, but I know for sure it's totally legal\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nfor someone to put ice in a cup\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.000\nand hand it to an alcoholic who has\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nhis own designs on the cup.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nThey could still be a bartender.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nIt's just a bar of ice.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:37.000\nThen we sidestep all of the municipal issues.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nThen you're going to want to still stop\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nand open up the bottle and then pour it in?\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:44.000\nI think that this conversation\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:48.000\nis putting ice in the cup of the evening.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:54.000\nI was just trying to help make it faster.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\nI don't want anyone to get arrested.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nI don't want...\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nI think we just have somebody make you drinks.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nAll right, okay.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nWe're not charging for it.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nBasically, if Camille came out here\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nand you said, hey, Camille,\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nwould you, while I'm talking,\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nwould you grab a cup with some ice in it\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nand throw a little vodka on top of it?\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nI don't think we get in trouble.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nWe're just meeting a new friend that's going to do that service.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nHow do we meet that person tonight?\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nThat's a conversation we have to have now.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nWho traveled the farthest?\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nThis guy.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:29.000\nNashville? Can somebody beat Nashville?\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nNorth Carolina.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nSouth Florida.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nYou're China?\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nSouth Florida?\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nVersus Australia.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nAustralia wins.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nAustralia, get up here.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nIf you want.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nPutzman!\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nIf this is a stunt,\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:55.000\nyou better be willing to fake one of the hardest accents there is.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nIt's deceptively hard, mate.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nI've tried it.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nCrocodile, mate.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nCome up here and grab a microphone.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nCome on up here, young lady.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nGrab yourself a mic.

Let's see what I got.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:46.000\nI'll chip in, too.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nWhat do we say?\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nYou want to go with the price?\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:57.000\nWell, I said $100, but I meant Australian.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:01.000\nWhat is the exchange on the Australian dollar right now, do you know?\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nI just know that whatever you offer somebody there,\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nthey say that's not that currency,\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nand then they pull out a bigger form of currency and say,\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:11.000\nthat's that form of currency.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\n20, 40, 60, 80...\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nIt's amazing that people still get that reference.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:18.000\nIt's so funny the things that make it through the sandstorms of time.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nSometimes I make references here.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:23.000\nTo the disco ball lady in dance hall days,\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\neveryone was just stone faced.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:28.000\nWhat are you talking about, grandpa?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nBut then for some reason,\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nwe're all going to just permanently retain Paul Hogan's\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:36.000\nthree-year stardom in the United States.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nIt was very culturally impacted.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nI only have $15. Can I chip in that?\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:43.000\nYeah, I have like 80. We're getting close to our mark.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nDo I have this?\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:46.000\n80.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nI have $17.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\n85.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nWe're going to put that close to 100.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\n95.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:54.000\nThere you go.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:55.000\nThat should be...\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nThat's it.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:02.000\n$100, paid in advance.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:09.000\nOkay, this show is like hitting the ground running.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:12.000\nSarah, I'd like a drink.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:16.000\nHe likes vodka on the rocks, so let's...\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nLet's see what happens.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nNow we're allowed to just ask you for a drink, right?\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nIt's not going to be a bullish thing for me to say,\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nSarah, get off your ass and give me a drink.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nNo, yeah. We own her now.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nWe've subjugated her.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nThat's the easiest $100 anyone's going to make.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:37.000\nI'm going to make it fucking so hard on you, Sarah.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:40.000\nYou're going to wish you'd never moved from Australia to here.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nYou're going to wish you said, nah.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:50.000\nAll right, so I don't know how long we can continue to delay this.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nWe have a superstar in the wings tonight.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nWe have an internet superstar.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\nDo we really?\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:58.000\nYeah.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nI was backstage. I didn't see any.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nOh, I forgot.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:09.000\nWe do have a man that might have changed social media for good.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nYeah, I guess...\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nLet's just bring him up and get to it.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:18.000\nPlease welcome the inventor of what salon.com calls Schrabbing.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nRob Schrabb.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nThank you, sir.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\ngorgeous. Perfect.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nSarah says she brought me a vodka in the rocks,\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nand she wanted to make sure that it was to my liking.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:45.000\nIt has equal parts vodka and ice.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:46.000\nSo, Schrabb.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:49.000\nYes, Davis.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:53.000\nWhat started as you haranguing our producer, Dustin Marshall, on Twitter,\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:57.000\nor Instagram, by just...\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:58.000\nI got good at it.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:02.000\nYou got really good at it.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:06.000\nTake us through the rich history that is Schrabbing.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nLike, how do we get to this place?\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:09.000\nWe're salons writing.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:13.000\nWhat I would call a very Woodford...\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:16.000\nWoodward and Bernstein's article.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nIt really got to the bottom of it.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nYeah, or not.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nI'll give you another choice.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:26.000\nYou can explain why, when you woke up during your colonoscopy,\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:31.000\nthat you chose to pretend to stay asleep.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nWait, what?\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nLet's talk about either of these things.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nOkay, I'll talk about the colonoscopy.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:41.000\nBecause I don't really know an answer to that.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nYour question.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:45.000\nYeah, it started off as a thing and then became...\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:49.000\nThe Schrabbing phenomenon, if we can call it a phenomenon,\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nwhich I believe now we can, right?\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nI'm not going to make that bold of a statement.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:59.000\nWhat blows my mind about Schrabbing is that everybody now tries to Schrab a Schrab.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nYou can't...\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:01.000\nYou can't Schrab a Schrab.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nYou can't Schrab a Schrab.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:03.000\nYou can't do it.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nBut also, it seems like an easy bit.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:06.000\nSeems easy.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nBut everybody does it wrong.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nDeceptively.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nIt's like the Australian accent.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nYou also said that a lot of people,\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nbecause the headline of the article was like the king of trolls,\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:17.000\nthat there's a lot of people just trying to now just troll you.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nDo you throw me?\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nThey'll tweet to me and it's like,\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nhey, Schrab, you're a piece of shit.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nWhy don't you go kill yourself?\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nTry saying smart to that.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nDidn't think so.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:34.000\nI didn't become the king of trolls, I'm quote, air quotes,\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:38.000\nking of trolls by dethrowing the other king of trolls.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nThere was no guy before you.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:40.000\nThat was like Johnsoning.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nYeah, there's not prison yard rules.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:45.000\nYou don't take down the troll.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:46.000\nYou do it.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:47.000\nYou put in the hours.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nYou work hard.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:53.000\nAnd you're just a business.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nYou're a work-a-day troll.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nNo, you do put a lot of elbow grease into it.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:01.000\nHow many followers did you gain, like a zillion followers?\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:06.000\nI had like 15,000.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nLike, thank you.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nIt was one person with 15,000.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:18.000\nAnd then after like the podcast,\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:21.000\nI went up to like 20,000.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nI got like 19 now.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:24.000\nThis was 5,000 people.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:27.000\nYeah, in like two weeks.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.000\nAll right, colonoscopy.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nOkay.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:30.000\nWhat do you want to know?\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:33.000\nWell, they put a camera up your butt.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:34.000\nThey sedate you before.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:35.000\nYes.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nI was recently in for an endoscopy.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nThat's the other way.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:41.000\nThese kids will learn all about this stuff soon enough.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:45.000\nIt becomes de rigueur, I believe the phrase is.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nNow they want to check out your tuchas.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:51.000\nThey put a camera up there, a little robe on a little Mars rover.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nThey sedate you.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nThey want to put you under.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nThe anesthesia didn't take.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nIt took right away.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:04.000\nThe nurse goes, okay, you should start feeling a little dizzy.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nAnd I'm like, I really don't feel.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nAnd then I was gone.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:13.000\nAnd then what I'm going to say is probably halfway through the procedure,\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:17.000\nI start waking up and I open up my eyes.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:22.000\nAnd there's a big screen in front of me because I'm laying on my side\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nand the screen is there because on the other side,\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:28.000\nthe doctor's like sticking this up my butt.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:31.000\nAnd I get to see what's inside my butt.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:34.000\nThis was the poster for the Truman Show, remember?\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:35.000\nRight.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:40.000\nAnd in my brain, my brain goes, you should say something.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:44.000\nAnd then I imagine myself saying something like going,\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:48.000\nI'm still awake.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:52.000\nAnd it just sounded like begging to be made fun of.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nThat's your concern in that moment.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:55.000\nYeah.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nAs you're living through everyone.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nAnd then I got...\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nRob, you're a director.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nYou could just say cut.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nMoving on.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:03.000\nCheck the gate.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nI mean, really check the gate.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:08.000\nBut I was going to say something.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:09.000\nI was going to say something.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:12.000\nBut then another voice in my head said,\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:17.000\nno, wait, I want to see if these guys are going to talk shit about me.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:24.000\nSo I kept my eyes closed and I just, I sat there.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:27.000\nAnd then actually I told this conversation to my dad who I,\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nyou know, like the next day because he says,\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nhow did it go?\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nI woke up in the middle of it, dad.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:34.000\nOh.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nOh.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:39.000\nThe cat is in the cradle in the silver spoon.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nLittle boy.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:45.000\nAnd we're on speakerphone in Kate's car because we're driving to Topanga.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nAnd I woke up in the middle of it, dad.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nAnd he goes, oh, that must have been weird.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nYou know something?\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nIt wasn't that bad.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nI was just silent.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:58.000\nJust, just, maybe okay.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nIt wasn't that bad.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:01.000\nWell, your dad was in the Navy, right?\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nToo close to home, maybe.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nProbably.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nWhere he met my mom.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nYou can tell him I said that.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nHe's the fan of yours.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:18.000\nThe, I just am amazed at how much different do you think had to do with the chemical reaction in your brain?\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:24.000\nLike how high do you think you were and how lucid do you think you were making a decision?\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:29.000\nLike I'm waking up in the middle of the American public's worst medical nightmare,\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:34.000\nwhich is failed anesthesia, which happens once at a 10,000 times.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:41.000\nAnd you're, you're waking up, which, and you make a decision based on like peer pressure.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:51.000\nAnd like a weird, like you want to know whether or not people make fun of your intestines behind your back.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nYeah.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nAnd you say, yeah.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:57.000\nI would be curious to know what kind of shit they might talk.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:00.000\nLook at this guy's fucking lower fucking colon.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nOh my God.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:05.000\nEat Taco Bell much?\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:06.000\nAll right.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:11.000\nLike the twist and turns like, oh, we got a Scotland highway here.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:15.000\nSo someone's going to Glasgow.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:16.000\nYeah.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nI mean, come on.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:19.000\nCome on.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:24.000\nI mean, if you work at a restaurant and you know, you're a waiter and you come back in the kitchen,\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:27.000\nyou go, man, table eight, what a bunch of dickheads.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nAnd we should spit in his colon.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:30.000\nYeah.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nHey, wake up.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nIt's great.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nOh, thanks.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:39.000\nYou know, I never, I didn't tip him.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nI should have done that.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nYeah.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:47.000\nRob, do you want to drink from Sarah from the Outback?\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nI'll have a yes.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:52.000\nCan we get a kettle one on the rocks?\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:55.000\nThank you, Sarah.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nNo, no, we pay her.\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nWe pay her.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nNo, I didn't tip her.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:04.000\nNow that this gets into the illegal right now, is this money?\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nOh, shit.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:10.000\nI only got 100.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:14.000\nNo, it's a receipt from El Pollo logo.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:19.000\nAnd by the way, I mean, like he keeps acting like that shopping thing in salon was like, like no big deal,\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:24.000\nbut he was texting and like, like he was like, I was like, you fucking asshole.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:25.000\nI hope you're happy.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nAnd he's like, this is all I ever wanted.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:32.000\nAnd then he texted me later and said, Jessica Alba is following me now.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:38.000\nBecause Jessica Alba, I'm meeting Jessica Alba's social media assistant probably is following,\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nwas following me.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nI noticed at one point, I'm sure it made you very jealous.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:44.000\nAnd so you texted me, Jessica Alba is following me now.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nAnd Valerie Burton-Elly.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nAnd I, and I.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\nValerie Burton-Elly.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nYou mean Queen of the Trolls?\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:51.000\nYep.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:54.000\nThat's, that's who I took down.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:57.000\nValerie Burton-Elly, you think you're so cool.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nFuck off.\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nTake it.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nThat's what I'm going to do.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nAll right.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:07.000\nThis one guy, this one guy, like right after the podcast was like, like, was Schrabbing me.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nIt was like going, oh, what is this?\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:14.000\nLike three times in a row and failed every single time.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:19.000\nAnd then like the fourth one he was, your bits getting old.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nHe ran out of gas on you.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nYeah.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:26.000\nLike I went out, I was at work and then I noticed like this train of this guy is like every\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:27.000\n15 minutes.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:30.000\nAnd then on the fourth tweet, your bits getting old.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:33.000\nI think you got to get some new material, buddy.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nOkay.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nAfter, after four times.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.000\nIs the, is the book deal, is it going to be, is what's your book going to be called?\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nLike what is this book called?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nHumble Bragg.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:48.000\nJust a, just a crown way heavy on the King of the Trolls.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nSo heavy.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nA lot of responsibility.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:54.000\nAnd my fingers are so aching from.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:57.000\nI'm so proud of the Camel's not here tonight because he will be.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nI think Camel hates me right now.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nCamel, yeah.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:05.000\nI think he absolutely, I've been texting him and writing him like, hey, Guardians of\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nGalaxy is one o'clock.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nWhat do you think?\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nNothing.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:12.000\nUsually you would be like, hey, we're going to see Star Trek into darkness.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nCome on.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.000\nWhatever.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:15.000\nYeah.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nNot anymore.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nHe's kind of busy.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:18.000\nBusy.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:19.000\nNot liking me.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nYeah.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:26.000\nWell, I kind of, I'm kind of eager to bring Spencer out because there's a, there's also\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\na new segment I'd like to do with him.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nYou think that would be okay to bring him at this early?\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nIt's never too early to bring Spencer out.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nAll right.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nSpencer Crittenden, everybody.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:41.000\nWho's coming?\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:49.000\nSpencer, don't, don't mix up those person.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:50.000\nHey, what?\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nDon't mix, don't mix up those person.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nI'll fucking kill you, man.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:58.000\nDon't mix them up.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nTwo person.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:05.000\nAre you live-Schrabbing right now?\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nWhat is that?\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:09.000\nYou're just, can I just be topped off with ice, Sarah?\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nI don't actually need more vodka.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.000\nOr maybe a little bit more.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nSpencer, have you met Sarah?\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:18.000\nI met it on the way up and the way down.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:21.000\nYou don't really drink though, do you, Spencer?\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:22.000\nNo.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nWould you like a drink while we have Sarah?\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nNo, no.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:27.000\nI'll go bad.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:31.000\nI'll just spoil immediately.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:35.000\nSpencer, I brought you up early because you mentioned something in the greener when I was like,\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:39.000\nokay, stop, save it for the stage.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:47.000\nTo catch us up, you're, you're, stop me if I start to become insensitive about this.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:52.000\nThat's an option?\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nDid you hear about this?\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nI haven't been on the show in a while.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:57.000\nWe would have no-\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:01.000\nStop him if he becomes insensitive.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:04.000\nGI Jeff would have been a different story.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:10.000\nStop me if I talk too much.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:16.000\nSince you've joined our family, Spencer, your parents have broken up.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.000\nYeah.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:21.000\nThey were kind of, as we've discussed it in the past, like, you kind of felt like maybe\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nyou were the glue that was holding them together.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nYeah, you know, I've long theorized that.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nAnd then you moved out.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:32.000\nWe've watched Spencer grow up from a, from a young waif, an urchin in the back of the\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nApple Star.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:41.000\nHe's now a producer and I think a hanger, a hanger, hanger about in the writer's room\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:46.000\nand like, well, you're-\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nAlso an unlicensed bartender.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nYeah, you may, oh yeah, constantly getting me drinks.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:51.000\nYeah.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:56.000\nI mean, it's, but, but you moved out of your parents' house and then they immediately went\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:57.000\ntheir separate ways.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nIt was pretty immediate.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:03.000\nAnd the last time we saw your dad, he was bounding up from the audience and he was\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nlike, hey, it's me, Spencer's dad.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:10.000\nOh yeah, Spencer has testicles.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:14.000\nSo, so the thing is, so now your, your parents have gone their separate ways and this is,\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nthis is not unfamiliar to me.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nWhen I was like 10, my parents had a little separation year.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\nYeah.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:26.000\nBut you're much older than that and this seems more permanent than theirs.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:31.000\nBut much like my parents, it kind of like, now you're watching your parents kind of like\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.000\ndo their own thing.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nYeah.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:38.000\nAnd your dad has gone to Central America?\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:42.000\nYeah, I'm pretty sure he's in Columbia right now.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:46.000\nAnd, and so I said that to Erin and she was like, is he going to be okay?\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nIt's like the kidnapping capital of the world.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:52.000\nLike, sorry if you're a Colombian Harmontown fan.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nAlso don't get kidnapped.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:55.000\nIt's safer there now.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nOkay.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:57.000\nThank you.\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:58.000\nWe got it.\n\n24:58.000 --> 24:59.000\nWe got a Colombian update.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:03.000\nUm, the, but, but you, so your dad, and now you told me in the green room, you said\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nyour dad is sending you updates.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:06.000\nLike there's letters.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:12.000\nAnd man, I keep, I keep, he sends these emails and started out just like, Hey Spencer, just\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nwanted to let you know, I got off the plane.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:15.000\nOkay.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nMy phone exploded, but then it was fine again.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:20.000\nOr like, you know, whatever, I stubbed my foot.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:21.000\nDo you stub a foot?\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nI don't know.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:28.000\nBut, um, he, he, he would just send me little things, but then it turned into this like\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:34.160\nChristmas style newsletter that would just happen and the email, like the list of recipients\n\n25:34.160 --> 25:36.160\ngot longer and longer.\n\n25:36.160 --> 25:42.840\nAnd there's people that I'm pretty sure are just my little brother's friends that like\n\n25:42.840 --> 25:44.840\nreceived this newsletter.\n\n25:44.840 --> 25:45.840\nAnd it's weird.\n\n25:45.840 --> 25:49.200\nIs it, is it just called like, uh, Mike's missives?\n\n25:49.200 --> 25:52.720\nThey're all, they're all cleverly titled individually.\n\n25:52.720 --> 25:54.800\nLike there's no title for the actual thing.\n\n25:54.800 --> 25:58.080\nLike he hasn't, no, each of them is like its own beautiful vignette.\n\n25:58.080 --> 26:04.040\nIf you think about example, he had an email that was like, Oh God, I fell asleep.\n\n26:04.040 --> 26:06.460\nI'm getting a haircut.\n\n26:06.460 --> 26:07.960\nNever fall asleep in Columbia.\n\n26:07.960 --> 26:11.880\nHow about never fall asleep getting a fucking haircut?\n\n26:11.880 --> 26:15.520\nThat's an insane person thing to do.\n\n26:15.520 --> 26:17.160\nI fall asleep getting haircuts all the time.\n\n26:17.160 --> 26:18.880\nThat's crazy.\n\n26:18.880 --> 26:21.040\nYou have a lot of faith in Europe.\n\n26:21.040 --> 26:26.640\nI was going to say your opponent, your bartenders, bartender, your bartender, what do you call\n\n26:26.640 --> 26:27.640\nit a barber?\n\n26:27.640 --> 26:28.640\nA salonist.\n\n26:28.640 --> 26:29.640\nA salonist.\n\n26:29.640 --> 26:30.640\nI don't call him a bartender.\n\n26:30.640 --> 26:31.640\nI call him a bartender.\n\n26:31.640 --> 26:32.640\nMaybe this is my problem.\n\n26:32.640 --> 26:39.600\nNo, but your barber, you, you don't count, man, your neck's going to be moving all around.\n\n26:39.600 --> 26:41.920\nYou don't, you don't fall asleep stock still.\n\n26:41.920 --> 26:47.200\nLast time the haircut you're currently looking at, I, I was fast asleep during that.\n\n26:47.200 --> 26:50.480\nAnd apparently my neck was not flapping around or maybe it was.\n\n26:50.480 --> 26:51.480\nThat's why it looks like this.\n\n26:51.480 --> 26:53.840\nMaybe you just got an iron neck or something.\n\n26:53.840 --> 26:59.520\nI mean, I wouldn't be surprised that that's what the ladies say at that point.\n\n26:59.520 --> 27:06.920\nI have a general rule, I, uh, I never travel anywhere where one of the rules is don't fall\n\n27:06.920 --> 27:07.920\nasleep.\n\n27:07.920 --> 27:11.160\nWell, I don't know if the rule is actually don't fall asleep.\n\n27:11.160 --> 27:16.480\nI think the only places that that's applicable in pop culture are the asylum where Freddie\n\n27:16.480 --> 27:19.280\nKrueger survivors live.\n\n27:19.280 --> 27:22.040\nIs he in like Medellin or Bogota or what's he doing?\n\n27:22.040 --> 27:23.880\nI think he's closer to Bogota.\n\n27:23.880 --> 27:24.880\nHe, he, he was.\n\n27:24.880 --> 27:25.880\nIs he on a vision quest?\n\n27:25.880 --> 27:26.880\nIs he doing ayahuasca?\n\n27:26.880 --> 27:29.760\nI wish that'd be so respectable.\n\n27:29.760 --> 27:32.880\nHe's, he's trying to, you know, get by.\n\n27:32.880 --> 27:34.320\nIt's cheaper to live there.\n\n27:34.320 --> 27:35.320\nHe's teaching English.\n\n27:35.320 --> 27:37.520\nOh, so he's gone there, not just for kicks.\n\n27:37.520 --> 27:39.440\nHe's gone there to make his way in the world.\n\n27:39.440 --> 27:40.440\nYeah.\n\n27:40.440 --> 27:41.440\nYeah.\n\n27:41.440 --> 27:44.960\nHe wants to, you know, eventually get, get a job and I'm like, uh, one of those, uh,\n\n27:44.960 --> 27:49.200\nTV companies out there stationed out there, you know, he used to work in TV.\n\n27:49.200 --> 27:50.200\nThat's great.\n\n27:50.200 --> 27:51.200\nThat's, that's admirable.\n\n27:51.200 --> 27:52.200\nIt's very cool.\n\n27:52.200 --> 27:53.200\nIt's certainly interesting.\n\n27:53.200 --> 27:54.200\nWhat's your mom doing?\n\n27:54.200 --> 27:56.200\nUh, you know, burn.\n\n27:56.200 --> 28:07.640\nShe, she's, I just, this is the perfect, I want to get a T-shirt like a Rob Schrab, like\n\n28:07.640 --> 28:13.800\na Schrabbing T-shirt that says, what is this T-shirt or what T-shirt is this?\n\n28:13.800 --> 28:16.520\nAnd then on the back, it says like, who is Rob Schrab or something.\n\n28:16.520 --> 28:20.440\nRemember when Rob used his own technique to promote the found crap thing?\n\n28:20.440 --> 28:22.440\nHe said, when is this thing I'm promoting?\n\n28:22.440 --> 28:23.920\nSo the thing, all right.\n\n28:23.920 --> 28:29.440\nAnyways, I wanted to, I was going to say you've become Rip Taylor, uh, the, uh, but before\n\n28:29.440 --> 28:35.720\nwe move on to your mom, yeah, he's panamining confetti, but it's better with confetti.\n\n28:35.720 --> 28:41.120\nYou can't just, you can't, you can't, before we, before we, before you answer about, about\n\n28:41.120 --> 28:44.920\nyour mom, I just want to, I want to ask about your dad, uh, are you trying to get off her\n\n28:44.920 --> 28:45.920\nmom?\n\n28:45.920 --> 28:46.920\nYeah.\n\n28:46.920 --> 28:47.920\nYes.\n\n28:47.920 --> 28:48.920\nI thought of that earlier.\n\n28:48.920 --> 28:52.240\nUh, I didn't get an opportunity to say, do you think your, your dad probably, I would\n\n28:52.240 --> 28:55.120\nguess he probably, not to flatter us, but he probably is listening.\n\n28:55.120 --> 28:56.120\nDon't you think?\n\n28:56.120 --> 28:57.120\nAh, maybe.\n\n28:57.120 --> 28:58.120\nI mean, you never know.\n\n28:58.120 --> 28:59.120\nCause what else is he doing down there?\n\n28:59.120 --> 29:00.120\nI really don't want to flatter him.\n\n29:00.120 --> 29:01.120\nI really don't want to flatter him.\n\n29:01.120 --> 29:02.120\nYeah.\n\n29:02.120 --> 29:03.120\nI mean, well, he's always having adventures.\n\n29:03.120 --> 29:04.120\nIt's kind of amazing.\n\n29:04.120 --> 29:08.080\nSpencer, do you want to fire off, assuming he's listening, which he, you know, he most\n\n29:08.080 --> 29:09.080\ncertainly is.\n\n29:09.080 --> 29:10.680\nDo you want to fire off a missive to him right now?\n\n29:10.680 --> 29:14.720\nUh, I don't know who you're sending all these fucking, or how many people you're sending\n\n29:14.720 --> 29:17.080\nthese emails to, but it's kind of ridiculous.\n\n29:17.080 --> 29:18.640\nSo, all right.\n\n29:18.640 --> 29:20.120\nThat was it?\n\n29:20.120 --> 29:21.120\nYeah.\n\n29:21.120 --> 29:23.360\nThis is how our communications go.\n\n29:23.360 --> 29:24.840\nThey're very matter of fact.\n\n29:24.840 --> 29:25.840\nAll right.\n\n29:25.840 --> 29:26.840\nAll right.\n\n29:26.840 --> 29:27.840\nYou, yeah.\n\n29:27.840 --> 29:28.840\nRight.\n\n29:28.840 --> 29:30.680\nRing, ring in your, uh, your recipient list.\n\n29:30.680 --> 29:34.480\nIt's offensive to all the people that you are sending it to, or have to feel like a piece\n\n29:34.480 --> 29:35.480\nof shit.\n\n29:35.480 --> 29:36.480\nYeah.\n\n29:36.480 --> 29:39.600\nI have to scroll past it all to get to the, you know, I'm on the list for certain like\n\n29:39.600 --> 29:40.600\npeople.\n\n29:40.600 --> 29:41.600\nThat's an LA thing.\n\n29:41.600 --> 29:45.840\nA big, a lot of times it's like, like an actor will just send out a newsletter that's\n\n29:45.840 --> 29:50.800\nlike Steve's daily Gazette or monthly, monthly Gazette.\n\n29:50.800 --> 29:51.800\nYeah.\n\n29:51.800 --> 29:53.960\nIt's like, it's been a weird month for Steve.\n\n29:53.960 --> 29:59.200\nI found a lot of solace in the documentary, uh, uh, Chocolate Man.\n\n29:59.200 --> 30:04.040\nUh, it's the story of a thing and he'll just talk about what he's been watching and it's\n\n30:04.040 --> 30:09.560\nlike, it's addressed to, and I want to say to like Steve, like, you know, have the balls\n\n30:09.560 --> 30:12.040\nto tell your grandma you love her.\n\n30:12.040 --> 30:16.200\nDon't send her a fucking newspaper because she's the only one who gives a shit about\n\n30:16.200 --> 30:22.000\nany of this and you're treating her like a fucking plebe, like just email your grandma\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:23.520\nand say, I love you.\n\n30:23.520 --> 30:25.480\nThank you for taking an interest in my shit.\n\n30:25.480 --> 30:26.480\nYeah.\n\n30:26.480 --> 30:28.000\nEveryone else is like, Steve's, what?\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nWhat is this?\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:30.000\nYeah.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:31.760\nHe had an audition for the shield.\n\n30:31.760 --> 30:32.760\nWhat the fuck has he taught?\n\n30:32.760 --> 30:33.760\nWhat?\n\n30:33.760 --> 30:35.760\nThat's canceled.\n\n30:35.760 --> 30:39.120\nHave you, have you seen, have you seen Chocolate Man?\n\n30:39.120 --> 30:40.120\nSo true.\n\n30:40.120 --> 30:41.120\nYeah.\n\n30:41.120 --> 30:45.160\nI mean, I've seen, I'm assuming you've seen Chocolate Man.\n\n30:45.160 --> 30:46.160\nIt's riveting.\n\n30:46.160 --> 30:47.160\nYeah.\n\n30:47.160 --> 30:54.160\nIt's, I mean, the guy can't keep, uh, the sad thing is that he can't keep a pet dog.\n\n30:54.160 --> 31:02.400\nLike, he loves dogs, but his livelihood is chocolate and they just keep dying on him.\n\n31:02.400 --> 31:05.640\nWait, wait, why can't Chocolate Man have a dog?\n\n31:05.640 --> 31:10.560\nChocolate is poisonous to dogs, but only really dark chocolate, but Chocolate Man is deals\n\n31:10.560 --> 31:14.840\nin dark, dark chocolate and he loves dogs.\n\n31:14.840 --> 31:16.920\nAnd no one will pay him to love dogs.\n\n31:16.920 --> 31:22.600\nSo it's, it becomes, as the New York Times said, it becomes an unwitting expose of dog\n\n31:22.600 --> 31:30.600\nculture, uh, what starts as a, as a, as a chock, chock a, chock a journey, dumb, stupid.\n\n31:30.600 --> 31:34.680\nThat's not a, that's not a play on words, it's not a play on words.\n\n31:34.680 --> 31:36.120\nNew York Times is not what it used to be.\n\n31:36.120 --> 31:37.120\nYeah.\n\n31:37.120 --> 31:38.120\nNo, no, no.\n\n31:38.120 --> 31:39.120\nIt's just a block now.\n\n31:39.120 --> 31:40.120\nRemember that guy that reviewed the podcast?\n\n31:40.120 --> 31:42.120\nHe's like, uh, Aaron's got a poo cast.\n\n31:42.120 --> 31:45.720\nKumeil Nanja Johnson is doing great.\n\n31:45.720 --> 31:47.720\nJim Davis is funny as always.\n\n31:47.720 --> 31:48.720\nAll right.\n\n31:48.720 --> 31:50.120\nThat's the New York Times.\n\n31:50.120 --> 31:51.480\nIt's really weird.\n\n31:51.480 --> 31:56.800\nAnd Salon will just do an article about Shra, but then clearly they're running on vapors\n\n31:56.800 --> 31:57.800\nout there.\n\n31:57.800 --> 31:58.800\nRight.\n\n31:58.800 --> 32:00.800\nA couple other websites too.\n\n32:00.800 --> 32:01.800\nOh yeah.\n\n32:01.800 --> 32:04.400\nThis, this is a story, this is a story of legs.\n\n32:04.400 --> 32:05.400\nDid it catch fire?\n\n32:05.400 --> 32:06.900\nDid it make it to TMZ?\n\n32:06.900 --> 32:07.900\nWhat's that?\n\n32:07.900 --> 32:08.900\nI sent it.\n\n32:08.900 --> 32:09.900\nI sent you another article.\n\n32:09.900 --> 32:10.900\nNo.\n\n32:10.900 --> 32:11.900\nI texted you.\n\n32:11.900 --> 32:14.160\nI said, most of the time when you text me something, I'll click on it and it's just\n\n32:14.160 --> 32:18.480\na dude with two dicks in his mouth.\n\n32:18.480 --> 32:19.480\nOnly two dicks?\n\n32:19.480 --> 32:20.480\nYeah.\n\n32:20.480 --> 32:21.480\nLike.\n\n32:21.480 --> 32:22.480\nSchrab's not what he used to be.\n\n32:22.480 --> 32:29.680\nI was the three-dick guy back in the day, but so lazy to do the work.\n\n32:29.680 --> 32:32.400\nBut, but, but so, so I didn't, by the way, I didn't retweet the Salon article.\n\n32:32.400 --> 32:35.720\nI'm very, very proud of you, but I kind of, I'm really conflicted about it.\n\n32:35.720 --> 32:40.640\nI'm boycott, I boycott Salon because of that weird, I don't know, they did a weird hatchet\n\n32:40.640 --> 32:43.680\njob on Patton Oswalt and I don't think that kind of stuff should be rewarded.\n\n32:43.680 --> 32:47.240\nIt was like that weird, it was just a, I just like, I'm not, I'm not clicking on it.\n\n32:47.240 --> 32:49.680\nWhat was the tweet that he did that got there, Dandruff?\n\n32:49.680 --> 32:50.680\nWho knows?\n\n32:50.680 --> 32:51.880\nWhatever it was, it was ironic.\n\n32:51.880 --> 32:58.360\nYou don't, you don't get more progressive and not racist than, than Patton Oswalt.\n\n32:58.360 --> 33:01.440\nHe doesn't give a fuck about, he's like, he's a, he's a comedian.\n\n33:01.440 --> 33:04.000\nHe's been, he's been making people laugh for a really long time.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:08.680\nPatton, as far as I know, is one of the most flagrant bigots I've ever seen.\n\n33:08.680 --> 33:13.720\nI don't even want to talk about it, I'll get my dander up and then I'll, then my dander\n\n33:13.720 --> 33:14.720\nwill go up.\n\n33:14.720 --> 33:15.720\nDon't do that.\n\n33:15.720 --> 33:16.720\nYeah.\n\n33:16.720 --> 33:17.720\nKeep that dander down, man.\n\n33:17.720 --> 33:20.720\nI prefer it to be dripping into my, uh, cough, than my, my cup.\n\n33:20.720 --> 33:23.840\nUm, I don't know why I'm looking at this anymore, let me see if there's anything else\n\n33:23.840 --> 33:24.840\non here.\n\n33:24.840 --> 33:28.560\nUh, did I ever tell the story about, uh, uh, Suckin' Dick?\n\n33:28.560 --> 33:38.740\nMmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\n33:38.740 --> 33:39.740\nDavis.\n\n33:39.740 --> 33:41.800\nNo you did not.\n\n33:41.800 --> 33:43.200\nPlease continue.\n\n33:43.200 --> 33:45.120\nAnd it's down.\n\n33:45.120 --> 33:46.120\nIt keeps scrolling.\n\n33:46.120 --> 33:47.120\nI do not have that honor.\n\n33:47.120 --> 33:48.120\nChaplin does.\n\n33:48.120 --> 33:49.120\nI wrote it.\n\n33:49.120 --> 33:50.120\nThe night is young.\n\n33:50.120 --> 33:57.360\nUh, my, uh, uh, one time, uh, did I ever tell this story that one time a friend of mine\n\n33:57.360 --> 33:59.800\nthat it's kind of like a super hacker.\n\n33:59.800 --> 34:02.720\nHe let me know that my iCloud account had been hacked.\n\n34:02.720 --> 34:05.880\nAnd that's why now I use this one password thing,\n\n34:05.880 --> 34:09.160\nlike this app, because I was using really easy passwords.\n\n34:09.160 --> 34:13.040\nAnd he let me know, yeah, we're tracking this guy.\n\n34:13.040 --> 34:17.440\nHe set up a thing, he hacks people's cell phones\n\n34:17.440 --> 34:20.960\nand high-profile people, and they traced back\n\n34:20.960 --> 34:23.080\nthis whole operation that this guy had set up\n\n34:23.080 --> 34:25.480\nand it started with Cameron Diaz's cell phone.\n\n34:25.480 --> 34:26.320\nThank you.\n\n34:26.320 --> 34:29.240\nTwo cell phones away from Cameron Diaz.\n\n34:29.240 --> 34:32.280\nThat's, I'm not in her cell phone,\n\n34:32.280 --> 34:34.840\nbut someone who is in Cameron Diaz's cell phone\n\n34:34.840 --> 34:37.840\nhas my number, probably Ben Stiller, from 18 years ago.\n\n34:37.840 --> 34:40.040\nAll right, not a good story.\n\n34:40.040 --> 34:41.360\nSorry about that.\n\n34:41.360 --> 34:43.200\nI thought it was interesting, put it in my Evernote.\n\n34:43.200 --> 34:44.040\nThat was the whole story?\n\n34:44.040 --> 34:45.400\nYes, yes, yes.\n\n34:45.400 --> 34:48.360\nI want to know about the dick sucking.\n\n34:48.360 --> 34:49.200\nYeah.\n\n34:49.200 --> 34:50.720\nYeah, why'd you drop that?\n\n34:51.840 --> 34:54.640\nDo you want to have that on her?\n\n34:54.640 --> 34:55.960\nDo you want to be on her?\n\n34:55.960 --> 34:57.920\nRob, would you honor Dan?\n\n34:58.840 --> 35:00.240\nI would love to.\n\n35:00.240 --> 35:01.080\nI would love to.\n\n35:01.080 --> 35:02.080\nI would love to.\n\n35:02.080 --> 35:03.080\nI would love to.\n\n35:03.080 --> 35:04.080\nI would love to.\n\n35:04.080 --> 35:05.400\nWhat does that mean?\n\n35:05.400 --> 35:07.040\nI've been a podcast where two straight guys\n\n35:07.040 --> 35:08.880\njust started sucking dick.\n\n35:08.880 --> 35:12.080\nI think they wouldn't be straight guys if that happened.\n\n35:12.080 --> 35:13.680\nThat's not, well, I don't guess it is.\n\n35:13.680 --> 35:15.240\nYeah, well, okay.\n\n35:15.240 --> 35:16.920\nTwo straight guys could suck a dick.\n\n35:16.920 --> 35:18.040\nEspecially, you know.\n\n35:18.040 --> 35:19.360\nIf one's when you're kind of.\n\n35:19.360 --> 35:21.680\nSucking dick for an audience.\n\n35:21.680 --> 35:22.520\nFor a cause.\n\n35:22.520 --> 35:23.840\nYeah, for a cause.\n\n35:23.840 --> 35:26.680\nIf you do it to raise awareness of something.\n\n35:26.680 --> 35:29.040\nUnless it's to raise awareness of sucking dick.\n\n35:29.040 --> 35:31.160\nThen it's.\n\n35:31.160 --> 35:33.840\nRaise awareness of how much you like a dick in your mouth.\n\n35:33.840 --> 35:35.760\nThen that's just, that's not charity.\n\n35:36.760 --> 35:41.760\nBut the, hello to all our homosexual listeners.\n\n35:41.800 --> 35:42.640\nHow are you?\n\n35:42.640 --> 35:44.160\nWe believe you're human.\n\n35:44.160 --> 35:45.560\nWe value your listenership.\n\n35:46.840 --> 35:47.680\nSorry.\n\n35:47.680 --> 35:49.480\nI think that was implicit until you said that weird\n\n35:49.480 --> 35:50.320\ndisclaimer.\n\n35:50.320 --> 35:53.800\nThat was a weird apology.\n\n35:55.240 --> 35:56.680\nAlso the word homosexual is now,\n\n35:56.680 --> 35:58.960\nit's the new like Afro-American.\n\n35:58.960 --> 36:00.880\nIt sounds kind of weird on the tongue, doesn't it now?\n\n36:00.880 --> 36:02.440\nHomosexual. Weird on the tongue.\n\n36:04.320 --> 36:07.440\nYou know what else feels kind of weird in the tongue?\n\n36:07.440 --> 36:08.280\nRob dick.\n\n36:10.200 --> 36:12.160\nWhat do you say now instead of homosexual?\n\n36:12.160 --> 36:13.000\nGay?\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:14.520\nI think, yeah, well, I don't know.\n\n36:14.520 --> 36:15.360\nIt's weird.\n\n36:15.360 --> 36:16.720\nI mean, it's not that it's a bad word.\n\n36:16.720 --> 36:18.640\nIt doesn't sound kind of clunky now.\n\n36:18.640 --> 36:21.000\nIt's kind of, he's saying it's kind of a mouthful.\n\n36:30.840 --> 36:32.520\nI don't know why I keep looking at my phone.\n\n36:32.520 --> 36:34.800\nI don't have anything on here anymore.\n\n36:34.800 --> 36:35.640\nI'm just like.\n\n36:35.640 --> 36:37.040\nBecause there's pictures of dicks on it.\n\n36:38.840 --> 36:41.040\nI don't like fundraising at the office,\n\n36:41.040 --> 36:42.240\nunless it's for charity.\n\n36:45.080 --> 36:47.320\nWhat in the sec way is going on?\n\n36:47.320 --> 36:48.760\nThat was the last thing on my phone.\n\n36:48.760 --> 36:50.160\nSo like book drives?\n\n36:50.160 --> 36:54.320\nListen to me, like, I'm not opposed to it.\n\n36:54.320 --> 36:55.680\nI'm not telling you to stop doing it.\n\n36:55.680 --> 36:56.760\nHere's what I'm saying.\n\n36:56.760 --> 36:57.880\nI think it's weird.\n\n36:57.880 --> 36:59.800\nI think we have accepted something as normal\n\n36:59.800 --> 37:00.840\nthat's very weird.\n\n37:00.840 --> 37:04.160\nI think that we all work at offices and office environments\n\n37:04.160 --> 37:05.800\nand we're all pretty familiar with the fact\n\n37:05.800 --> 37:08.480\nthat every once in a while someone comes to the office\n\n37:08.480 --> 37:11.040\nand they'll just kind of announce\n\n37:11.040 --> 37:13.680\nthat their niece, Katie, is going to Scotland\n\n37:13.680 --> 37:16.840\nto play soccer or learn to play the trumpet or something.\n\n37:16.840 --> 37:19.320\nNothing to do with any disease or anything.\n\n37:19.320 --> 37:22.560\nIt's just like, just some kid is going to do something\n\n37:22.560 --> 37:24.720\nand then everyone at the office is kind of like\n\n37:24.720 --> 37:28.160\nsubtly pressured to like buy a Kit Kat or something.\n\n37:28.160 --> 37:29.480\nI just think it's really weird\n\n37:29.480 --> 37:31.560\nthat we accept this as common behavior.\n\n37:31.560 --> 37:33.800\nI'm assuming your office meeting Starburns?\n\n37:33.800 --> 37:35.160\nWell, I'm not complaining about anyone\n\n37:35.160 --> 37:36.840\nthat works for me right now.\n\n37:36.840 --> 37:38.080\nI'm just saying it's-\n\n37:38.080 --> 37:38.920\nPeople come in and say,\n\n37:38.920 --> 37:41.640\nhey, my daughter's going on a trip and everybody pony up.\n\n37:41.640 --> 37:43.400\nBy applause, how many people have been in an office\n\n37:43.400 --> 37:44.240\nwhere this has happened?\n\n37:44.240 --> 37:47.440\nSmattering.\n\n37:47.440 --> 37:51.160\nThat's a well, well, easily 1,100 people.\n\n37:51.160 --> 37:52.680\nYeah.\n\n37:52.680 --> 37:55.040\nIt happens outside of the grocery store too.\n\n37:55.040 --> 37:56.880\nYou never know, you ever notice this?\n\n37:56.880 --> 37:58.600\nYou ever see one of these?\n\n37:58.600 --> 38:01.800\nYou're going into the grocery store?\n\n38:01.800 --> 38:02.640\nYou're trying to make-\n\n38:02.640 --> 38:03.920\nRob, are you about to break into one of your\n\n38:03.920 --> 38:05.600\npatented universal comedy bits?\n\n38:05.600 --> 38:06.440\nYeah.\n\n38:06.440 --> 38:09.000\nYeah, you walk it in and you see him\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:10.360\nand then what do you do?\n\n38:10.360 --> 38:11.360\nYou pull out your phone.\n\n38:11.360 --> 38:14.520\nWho I'm checking a text in you?\n\n38:14.520 --> 38:16.360\nRight by, man.\n\n38:16.360 --> 38:18.840\nNo, I will not have a chocolate bar.\n\n38:18.840 --> 38:21.720\nNo, I do not want that.\n\n38:21.720 --> 38:23.520\nI'm looking at my phone.\n\n38:23.520 --> 38:26.080\nI walk too fast.\n\n38:26.080 --> 38:28.600\nI told you the story about the guy that came to my door,\n\n38:28.600 --> 38:31.280\nat my house, and he had a baseball cap on it.\n\n38:31.280 --> 38:34.040\nHe had kind of a Kevin James sort of build.\n\n38:34.040 --> 38:34.720\nAnd-\n\n38:34.720 --> 38:37.760\nSo, very fit and lean.\n\n38:37.760 --> 38:41.320\nAnd he rang my doorbell and I came out and-\n\n38:41.320 --> 38:44.720\nAnd I said, of course I'm in the middle of something.\n\n38:44.720 --> 38:46.440\nNo one is ever sitting in a glass chamber\n\n38:46.440 --> 38:49.160\nwaiting to interact with a stranger at their door.\n\n38:49.160 --> 38:50.480\nSo, that's another thing.\n\n38:50.480 --> 38:55.480\nIf your hobby or vocation involves costing strangers,\n\n38:55.680 --> 38:58.320\ntry to remember you're in the middle of their lives,\n\n38:58.320 --> 38:59.760\nnot the other way around.\n\n39:01.360 --> 39:02.440\nAll right, well, sorry.\n\n39:02.440 --> 39:04.840\nSorry, we're new at this.\n\n39:04.840 --> 39:07.600\nSarah went to get Jeff a drink and I let it derail the show.\n\n39:07.600 --> 39:08.960\nAre you okay with this?\n\n39:08.960 --> 39:10.200\nI'm so sorry.\n\n39:10.200 --> 39:11.920\nShe's making a hundred dollars.\n\n39:11.920 --> 39:12.760\nWe're in the-\n\n39:12.760 --> 39:13.600\nShe's already made it.\n\n39:13.600 --> 39:15.800\nShe can walk out the door right now.\n\n39:15.800 --> 39:17.480\nShe could just disappear into the night\n\n39:17.480 --> 39:18.960\nand she would have a hundred dollars too.\n\n39:18.960 --> 39:20.560\nWe saw a crocodile dundee too.\n\n39:20.560 --> 39:22.440\nNot only can she leave, she can go somewhere\n\n39:22.440 --> 39:24.440\nthat even cartels can't get her.\n\n39:26.200 --> 39:28.960\nShe could put like bats in bags\n\n39:28.960 --> 39:30.280\nand throw them on our campfire.\n\n39:30.280 --> 39:32.120\nAnd we'd be like, ah, I carumba!\n\n39:33.760 --> 39:34.640\nDid that happen?\n\n39:34.640 --> 39:37.400\nYeah, Sarah, you've already made your money, Sarah.\n\n39:37.400 --> 39:39.040\nIf at any point you want to just disappear,\n\n39:39.040 --> 39:39.880\nyou're allowed to.\n\n39:39.880 --> 39:42.400\nYou're not beholden to stay up here on stage.\n\n39:42.400 --> 39:43.880\nAlthough, we would love you to stay.\n\n39:43.880 --> 39:45.520\nI think her date applauded that.\n\n39:47.360 --> 39:48.840\nNo, I think she was beholden.\n\n39:48.840 --> 39:49.680\nWe gave her a hundred bucks.\n\n39:49.680 --> 39:51.440\nShe's gonna give us 50 if she leaves.\n\n39:53.680 --> 39:54.880\nAll right.\n\n39:54.880 --> 39:56.640\nWhat kind of crazy-\n\n39:56.640 --> 39:59.400\nI'm just saying, it's not indentured servitude.\n\n40:00.200 --> 40:01.640\nOh, I mean, if you wanted it that way,\n\n40:01.640 --> 40:03.160\nwe'd say we'll give you a hundred dollars\n\n40:03.160 --> 40:04.440\nat the end of the show.\n\n40:04.440 --> 40:06.520\nI'm gonna give you $20 to please sit down\n\n40:06.520 --> 40:09.960\nbecause you're making me feel bad.\n\n40:09.960 --> 40:12.680\nHe's paying you $20 to devalue my hundred.\n\n40:15.280 --> 40:16.600\nWhat kind of crazy-\n\n40:17.600 --> 40:18.920\nI put 17.\n\n40:18.920 --> 40:20.880\nYou paid 83, whatever.\n\n40:20.880 --> 40:21.720\nRight.\n\n40:21.720 --> 40:24.040\nAll right, Sarah, I mean, you're free to go.\n\n40:24.040 --> 40:25.480\nI'm not gonna be Sauron.\n\n40:27.920 --> 40:28.760\nI think stay.\n\n40:30.480 --> 40:31.320\nDo what you want.\n\n40:31.320 --> 40:32.880\nYes, keep it, keep it, keep it.\n\n40:32.880 --> 40:36.560\nAlso, keep my guilt money.\n\n40:36.560 --> 40:38.080\nThe reason why I feel bad is\n\n40:38.080 --> 40:39.200\nbecause we have a woman on stage\n\n40:39.200 --> 40:41.200\nand she's not talking at all.\n\n40:41.200 --> 40:44.080\nAs always, there's a bunch of dudes sounding off\n\n40:44.080 --> 40:46.000\nand that we have a gal on stage.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:47.680\nGive her a microphone, Dan.\n\n40:50.320 --> 40:52.040\nThis microphone costs $15.\n\n40:52.040 --> 40:52.880\nYes.\n\n40:52.880 --> 41:01.840\nWhat's like a good Aussie like bar drinking, bar song?\n\n41:01.840 --> 41:04.560\nHow about the person I asked?\n\n41:04.560 --> 41:09.200\nIs there like an Aussie toast, like a famous cheerer,\n\n41:09.200 --> 41:12.000\nlike a poem or a rhyme or anything like that?\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:13.680\nIt would be Aussie, Aussie, Aussie,\n\n41:13.680 --> 41:16.960\nand then everyone goes oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, yeah.\n\n41:16.960 --> 41:18.800\nDidn't they do that on the man show\n\n41:18.800 --> 41:20.240\nwhen Kimmel was on there?\n\n41:20.240 --> 41:21.600\nDid they do some kind of thing like that?\n\n41:21.600 --> 41:23.600\nYeah, we got it in Mexico, people knew it.\n\n41:23.600 --> 41:24.560\nIs that right?\n\n41:24.560 --> 41:25.280\nYeah.\n\n41:25.280 --> 41:26.480\nI love that.\n\n41:26.480 --> 41:27.040\nIt's nice.\n\n41:27.040 --> 41:28.480\nWhat part of Australia are you from?\n\n41:28.480 --> 41:29.360\nMelbourne.\n\n41:29.360 --> 41:30.080\nMelbourne.\n\n41:30.080 --> 41:31.600\nI went there once, it was quite lovely.\n\n41:31.600 --> 41:33.600\nIt's very funny people, very nice.\n\n41:34.480 --> 41:35.680\nIs it true about the toilets?\n\n41:38.720 --> 41:40.640\nIs that an urban legend or is that true?\n\n41:40.640 --> 41:41.840\nThat they're full of poo?\n\n41:42.640 --> 41:45.280\nNo, that they swirl in opposite directions.\n\n41:45.280 --> 41:46.480\nYeah, the southern hemisphere.\n\n41:46.480 --> 41:49.360\nHow long did that take before somebody figured it out?\n\n41:49.360 --> 41:53.040\nYou know, because they're living on the other side of the world,\n\n41:53.040 --> 41:58.560\nand then, I mean, somebody would have had to have gone to the bathroom,\n\n41:58.560 --> 42:02.720\nstared at the toilet, went, ooh, counterclockwise,\n\n42:02.720 --> 42:05.680\nand then jumped on the plane, flew to America,\n\n42:05.680 --> 42:07.040\nand then immediately did it.\n\n42:07.040 --> 42:08.720\nDan, are you pouring yourself a drink right now?\n\n42:08.720 --> 42:11.280\nYeah, you guys freed our indentured servant.\n\n42:11.280 --> 42:14.160\nNo, she stayed up here, she had a job to do.\n\n42:14.160 --> 42:15.520\nPut that ice back in the bucket.\n\n42:17.040 --> 42:18.640\nHere, I'll take the ice.\n\n42:18.640 --> 42:19.920\nI'll take the ice.\n\n42:19.920 --> 42:20.480\nI'll take the ice.\n\n42:20.480 --> 42:21.520\nNo, let her do it.\n\n42:21.520 --> 42:22.400\nWe fucking paid her.\n\n42:23.120 --> 42:23.280\nI'll take the ice.\n\n42:23.280 --> 42:24.400\nI'm so fucking confused.\n\n42:24.400 --> 42:28.160\nThis is exactly what was happening in America in 1848.\n\n42:30.480 --> 42:33.120\nLike, there was a lot of like, we...\n\n42:33.120 --> 42:34.720\nCan you pass it down, pass it down?\n\n42:34.720 --> 42:38.480\nLook, it's to our discomfort\n\n42:38.480 --> 42:40.000\nthat it happened to be a woman that came over.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:41.840\nI said, guy, you wouldn't be bothered by this at all.\n\n42:41.840 --> 42:42.240\nNo.\n\n42:42.240 --> 42:43.680\nI wasn't bothered with it.\n\n42:43.680 --> 42:46.960\nI love throwing money at people and just like,\n\n42:46.960 --> 42:49.840\nthat's what I do with Spencer.\n\n42:49.840 --> 42:50.800\nEasy, easy, easy.\n\n42:50.800 --> 42:51.600\nEverybody wins.\n\n42:51.600 --> 42:51.840\nYeah, okay.\n\n42:51.840 --> 42:53.840\nYou're better than my stand to show up full paint spray.\n\n42:53.840 --> 42:54.960\nAdam, sit the fuck down.\n\n42:55.840 --> 42:56.560\nAdam?\n\n42:56.560 --> 42:58.000\nAdam, sit down.\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:00.160\nI'll pay you $20 to shut the fuck up.\n\n43:01.360 --> 43:02.640\nNo, I don't have any more money.\n\n43:02.640 --> 43:03.040\nGet away.\n\n43:04.400 --> 43:05.200\nGet away from me.\n\n43:05.200 --> 43:06.560\nI just, I like a lot of ice.\n\n43:06.560 --> 43:08.160\nWhen the home audience doesn't know right now,\n\n43:08.160 --> 43:08.960\nthe listener doesn't know.\n\n43:09.520 --> 43:11.360\nAdam is hiding behind a beam right now.\n\n43:13.840 --> 43:15.280\nAnd he's holding a vial.\n\n43:15.280 --> 43:16.640\nI said, water bottle.\n\n43:16.640 --> 43:17.360\nYeah.\n\n43:17.360 --> 43:17.840\nYeah, right.\n\n43:17.840 --> 43:19.840\nHe's wrapped around a pillar like a snake.\n\n43:19.840 --> 43:22.000\nLike the water bottle in the end of 12 monkeys.\n\n43:22.880 --> 43:24.000\nAm I mistaken, Adam?\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:25.920\nOr I don't want to bring you up on stage.\n\n43:25.920 --> 43:26.480\nI really don't.\n\n43:27.280 --> 43:28.960\nAnd Adam, I say this with all due respect.\n\n43:28.960 --> 43:29.440\nI love you.\n\n43:29.440 --> 43:30.400\nI respect you.\n\n43:30.400 --> 43:33.040\nNo, not as due, but all is offered.\n\n43:34.800 --> 43:35.840\nI do like you, Adam.\n\n43:35.840 --> 43:39.120\nBut when Abed on the last show was up here,\n\n43:39.120 --> 43:41.680\nwere you losing your mind because you got out Asperger'd?\n\n43:42.560 --> 43:42.800\nYes.\n\n43:42.800 --> 43:48.400\nBecause you were firing off like quips and fucking non sequiturs.\n\n43:48.400 --> 43:52.480\nLike, you couldn't believe there was a guy on stage\n\n43:52.480 --> 43:53.840\nthat was weirder than you.\n\n43:54.880 --> 43:56.400\nEvil knows evil.\n\n43:58.160 --> 43:59.120\nYou're out of a job.\n\n44:00.320 --> 44:00.880\nYeah.\n\n44:00.880 --> 44:03.360\nBut why are you standing until well lit?\n\n44:05.920 --> 44:07.600\nNow you're kneeling in the Iowa.\n\n44:07.600 --> 44:08.160\nAre you going to murder us?\n\n44:08.160 --> 44:09.200\nSomeone took your chair.\n\n44:10.560 --> 44:11.280\nWhat are you doing?\n\n44:11.280 -->

44:26.240\nAdam, you're the only person that's standing poised to charge the stage.\n\n44:26.240 --> 44:27.600\nI just want to say, if you give her the mic stand,\n\n44:27.600 --> 44:29.600\nshe'll have both her hands free to four drinks.\n\n44:30.240 --> 44:32.400\nThat's all I wanted to add, so you can get more drinks.\n\n44:33.040 --> 44:33.840\nThere we go.\n\n44:33.840 --> 44:35.760\nI mean, but I'm not giving up my mic stand.\n\n44:36.880 --> 44:37.680\nThank you, Adam.\n\n44:37.680 --> 44:39.680\nYou were trying to liberate her genius.\n\n44:39.680 --> 44:40.240\nYes.\n\n44:40.240

means something.\n\n44:56.880 --> 44:57.760\nSorry about Adam.\n\n44:57.760 --> 44:58.800\nHave you ever listened to the show?\n\n44:58.800 --> 44:59.680\nDo you know what's happening?\n\n45:01.040 --> 45:02.240\nYes, I have listened to it before.\n\n45:02.240 --> 45:02.560\nOkay.\n\n45:03.520 --> 45:07.040\nI don't know if maybe there was a wayward poaching expedition.\n\n45:07.040 --> 45:09.600\nYou got drank darted and stuck in a crate.\n\n45:09.600 --> 45:12.800\nAnd now you're here and you're like, wow.\n\n45:12.800 --> 45:14.560\nDo kangaroos really box?\n\n45:17.680 --> 45:18.480\nIs that a thing?\n\n45:19.200 --> 45:20.960\nYeah, there's some really tall kangaroos.\n\n45:20.960 --> 45:23.520\nAnd when they get up on their hind legs, they're like six foot tall.\n\n45:23.520 --> 45:26.240\nAnd if you make them angry, they will punch you in the face.\n\n45:27.280 --> 45:28.000\nWith their front paw.\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:29.200\nWith their boxing gloves.\n\n45:29.200 --> 45:30.800\nThat's like a natural thing they'll do?\n\n45:30.800 --> 45:32.880\nYeah, because they get up like this,\n\n45:32.880 --> 45:34.960\nand they're like really, really

culture, that every Australian kind of knows,\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:21.040\nbut that once you leave those waters,\n\n46:21.040 --> 46:23.040\nlike you find that it just drops off entirely.\n\n46:23.040 --> 46:25.360\nLike it's just like this Australian thing.\n\n46:25.360 --> 46:27.760\nIs this you trying to find out if they watch community in Australia?\n\n46:27.760 --> 46:28.640\nNo, no, no,

Castle.\n\n46:58.800 --> 47:00.640\nUm, yep.\n\n47:00.640 --> 47:03.120\nSo that's like, everyone in Australia can quote that movie.\n\n47:03.120 --> 47:04.320\nLike, from the start.\n\n47:04.320 --> 47:05.760\nWhat's the movie The Castle about?\n\n47:05.760 --> 47:09.360\nUm, it's about this family's small suburban town.\n\n47:11.920 --> 47:14.800\nWhy do you hold your mic to your face to make that distracting sound?\n\n47:16.960 --> 47:18.400\nIt's about a small suburban.\n\n47:18.400 --> 47:19.280\nSo it's, yeah.\n\n47:19.280 --> 47:19.680\nSo it's just like a-\n\n47:19.680 --> 47:21.280\nWhat is the movie Castle about?\n\n47:23.680 --> 47:24.480\nBut the fuck your head?\n\n47:24.480 --> 47:25.520\nIt's not about a castle.\n\n47:26.080 --> 47:26.560\nIt's not.\n\n47:26.560

metaphor.\n\n47:36.800 --> 47:36.800\nYeah.\n\n47:38.160 --> 47:38.880\nIt's a metaphor.\n\n47:38.880 --> 47:40.080\nAre you fucking eight-year-old?\n\n47:41.840 --> 47:44.640\nAnd also, there's a movie called The Castle in the States,\n\n47:44.640 --> 47:45.680\nand it's not-\n\n47:45.680 --> 47:47.360\nJames Gandolfini in a prison.\n\n47:47.360 --> 47:48.320\nLike, it's not-\n\n47:48.320 -->

47:56.160\nNext time you wake up and there's a camera up your ass,\n\n47:56.160 --> 48:00.560\njust say, excuse me, excuse me, madam.\n\n48:01.920 --> 48:03.280\nI happen to be conscious.\n\n48:03.280 --> 48:06.720\nCould you please give me more, whatever you put in the-\n\n48:06.720 --> 48:08.400\nIf I woke up in the middle of a procedure\n\n48:08.400 --> 48:10.960\nwhere they told me beforehand I was supposed to be asleep,\n\n48:10.960 --> 48:13.440\nI would fucking start making a lot of noise.\n\n48:13.440 --> 48:16.080\nListen to Rob, Rob, Rob thinks you have to have a monocle\n\n48:16.080 --> 48:17.920\nin a top hat and be British.\n\n48:17.920 --> 48:20.000\nThat's such a fancy thing to say.\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:21.360\nYou're ass-raping me.\n\n48:22.400 --> 48:23.600\nThat's so fancy.\n\n48:23.600 --> 48:25.600\nI would just say you-\n\n48:25.600 --> 48:27.040\nI wouldn't want to be pretentious.\n\n48:27.040 --> 48:28.800\nThat would have been probably-\n\n48:28.800 --> 48:31.920\nI paid a lot of money to be asleep for the next 12 hours\n\n48:31.920 --> 48:34.000\nand I'm awake during the thing.\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:38.000\nI would feel like it's just a good idea to say,\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.400\nI'm awake and put me back to sleep or stop-\n\n48:40.400 --> 48:42.880\nI should have just started screaming as loud as I could.\n\n48:43.840 --> 48:44.720\nThat would have-\n\n48:44.720 --> 48:45.360\nThen they wouldn't-\n\n48:45.360 --> 48:47.840\nThey would have been, oh, shit, fucking get him,\n\n48:47.840 --> 48:52.240\nfill him up, dump the shit on him, make him go to sleep.\n\n48:52.240 --> 48:53.440\nAll right, what's the castle about?\n\n48:53.440 --> 48:54.880\nIt's about a small family.\n\n48:55.600 --> 48:56.640\nThey live in a little-\n\n48:56.640 --> 48:59.360\nMark Castle can't make it through college.\n\n49:02.160 --> 49:03.760\nUntil he met a friend.\n\n49:04.480 --> 49:06.880\nDress up like two women.\n\n49:08.320 --> 49:10.160\nMate, I

demographics.\n\n53:39.520 --> 53:40.000\nExample.\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:41.200\nSo, I don't know.\n\n53:41.200 --> 53:42.160\nIt's hard to say.\n\n53:42.160 --> 53:43.600\nBut yeah, generally two guys.\n\n53:43.600 --> 53:44.320\nIt's pretty common.\n\n53:45.040 --> 53:45.600\nYep.\n\n53:45.600 --> 53:47.760\nYou don't know any names offhand like, like,\n\n53:48.800 --> 53:49.520\ntube sock

don't-\n\n54:25.360 --> 54:26.640\nYeah, I don't know why they do that.\n\n54:26.640 --> 54:27.760\nI think it's just more casual\n\n54:27.760 --> 54:29.520\nand we'd just like to be casual, so.\n\n54:29.520 --> 54:30.400\nOh, fuck, wait a minute.\n\n54:30.400 --> 54:31.760\nWasn't there a zoo team in-\n\n54:31.760 --> 54:33.120\nWas it Australian?\n\n54:33.120 --> 54:34.240\nThose guys that called-\n\n54:34.240 --> 54:35.920\nThere was like a scandal where they called\n\n54:35.920 --> 54:38.400\nand pretended to be a friend of the-\n\n54:38.400 --> 54:38.880\nAnd they-\n\n54:38.880 --> 54:39.280\nThere was-\n\n54:39.280 --> 54:40.640\nIt was a horrible thing that happened.\n\n54:40.640 --> 54:41.440\nLike, they did a little-\n\n54:41.440 --> 54:43.360\nThey did a prank about the-\n\n54:43.360 --> 54:45.360\nThere was the royal baby in England\n\n54:45.360 --> 54:46.960\nand they pretended to be a nurse\n\n54:46.960 --> 54:48.000\nor something like that or-\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:48.400\nYeah.\n\n54:48.400 --> 54:49.200\nTalked to a nurse.\n\n54:50.240 --> 54:50.560\nWhat it-\n\n54:52.160 --> 54:53.200\nIt went like this.\n\n54:53.200 --> 54:53.680\nMy cuff-\n\n54:53.680 --> 54:54.160\nMy cuff-\n\n54:54.160 --> 54:57.440\nMy cuff link managed to hit a button.\n\n54:57.440 --> 54:57.840\nThat's true.\n\n54:57.840 --> 54:58.320\nIt's yes.\n\n54:58.320 --> 54:59.920\nIt's a pretty sad story.\n\n54:59.920 --> 55:02.080\nBasically, there was two DJs\n\n55:02.080 --> 55:03.840\nand they called up the hospital\n\n55:03.840 --> 55:05.760\nwhere Kate Middleton was giving birth\n\n55:05.760 --> 55:06.960\nand they got through to a nurse\n\n55:06.960 --> 55:07.280\nand they said,\n\n55:07.280 --> 55:08.720\noh, we're the queen or someone.\n\n55:08.720 --> 55:09.840\nI don't know who they said.\n\n55:09.840 --> 55:10.960\nAnd they said,\n\n55:10.960 --> 55:11.840\noh, what's happening?\n\n55:11.840 --> 55:12.960\nAnd she was like, oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n55:12.960 --> 55:14.240\nAnd gave all this information.\n\n55:15.280 --> 55:16.800\nAnd then they aired it\n\n55:16.800 --> 55:19.120\nand then the nurse killed herself.\n\n55:19.920 --> 55:20.400\nWhat?\n\n55:20.400 --> 55:21.200\nAnd she left a note saying-\n\n55:21.200 --> 55:22.560\nYay, Media!\n\n55:22.560 --> 55:24.000\nBecause of-\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:25.280\nDid she gave up the good?\n\n55:25.280 --> 55:26.240\nWell, she was humiliated.\n\n55:26.240 --> 55:27.200\nShe was humiliated.\n\n55:27.200 --> 55:28.240\nThought she would lose her job,\n\n55:28.240 --> 55:29.040\nget in big trouble.\n\n55:29.040 --> 55:30.160\nAnd she left a note saying\n\n55:30.160 --> 55:31.680\nthat these DJs basically had to\n\n55:31.680 --> 55:32.640\ntake care of her family now\n\n55:32.640 --> 55:33.600\nand it was their fault.\n\n55:33.600 --> 55:34.320\nWhoa!\n\n55:34.320 --> 55:34.800\nYeah.\n\n55:34.800 --> 55:35.360\nAnd they've only-\n\n55:35.360 --> 55:36.400\nLike, I think only one of them\n\n55:36.400 --> 55:37.600\nhas just gone back to work\n\n55:37.600 --> 55:38.560\nlike over a year later.\n\n55:38.560 --> 55:38.960\nAnd he's like,\n\n55:38.960 --> 55:40.720\nhe's like very trepidatiously\n\n55:40.720 --> 55:41.440\nhis first day of work.\n\n55:41.440 --> 55:47.280\nIt's a squeaker in the morning.\n\n55:47.280 --> 55:51.440\nLooks like it's high of 68.\n\n55:51.440 --> 55:53.440\nBit less of a pitch at the pump, then.\n\n55:56.720 --> 55:57.360\nWho are-\n\n56:01.360 --> 56:03.360\nHere's Bill Callens.\n\n56:07.360 --> 56:08.480\nYeah, it's funny to ask\n\n56:08.480 --> 56:10.880\nbecause everyone that was affected\n\n56:10.880 --> 56:11.840\nwas on some island.\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:15.360\nWe got our own problems over here.\n\n56:17.280 --> 56:19.920\nThat's horrible for everyone involved.\n\n56:19.920 --> 56:20.640\nI remember that.\n\n56:20.640 --> 56:21.120\nThat stuck out.\n\n56:21.120 --> 56:21.440\nAnd I thought-\n\n56:21.440 --> 56:22.160\nWhat really stuck out was\n\n56:22.160 --> 56:23.120\nthat they were Australian.\n\n56:23.120 --> 56:24.080\nThey weren't even like-\n\n56:24.080 --> 56:25.520\nBecause really honestly,\n\n56:25.520 --> 56:25.920\nand not to-\n\n56:25.920 --> 56:27.520\nI mean, it's very easy\n\n56:27.520 --> 56:28.560\nwhen something horrible like that\n\n56:28.560 --> 56:30.400\nhappens to like jump on\n\n56:30.400 --> 56:31.760\nwhoever was immediately like,\n\n56:31.760 --> 56:33.120\nwhat were you guys thinking?\n\n56:33.120 --> 56:34.640\nBut they were thinking,\n\n56:34.640 --> 56:36.480\nwe're Australian DJs.\n\n56:36.480 --> 56:38.160\nWe shouldn't be able to get away\n\n56:38.160 --> 56:38.880\nwith any of this.\n\n56:38.880 --> 56:39.520\nAnd they were kind of like\n\n56:39.520 --> 56:40.400\ntrying to do a prank.\n\n56:40.400 --> 56:41.600\nI'm not sticking up for anybody.\n\n56:43.440 --> 56:44.000\nYeah, whatever.\n\n56:44.880 --> 56:46.320\nEveryone's on their edge of their seats.\n\n56:46.320 --> 56:49.840\nWho's Dan in favor of in this story?\n\n56:51.200

56:56.800\nthey said they didn't want it aired.\n\n56:57.600 --> 56:58.720\nAnd it wasn't their decision\n\n56:58.720 --> 57:00.480\nin the end and some higher up.\n\n57:00.480 --> 57:00.880\nOh,

58:25.360\nto call your clan to fight for you.\n\n58:26.720 --> 58:28.720\nAnd then we just think it's like an instrument.\n\n58:28.720 --> 58:29.120\nAnd we're like,\n\n58:29.120 --> 58:32.880\nand

Brut.\n\n01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.240\nWhat's a Bruto?\n\n01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:36.720\nWhat's his name?\n\n01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:37.440\nBruto.\n\n01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.480\nTiny Lister?\n\n01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.440\nYeah, if he's still got it.\n\n01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.400\nTiny Lister, yeah.\n\n01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.600\nStill got it.\n\n01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.560\nNever lost it.\n\n01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.600\nWho's Poop Deck Pappy?\n\n01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.000\nMorgan Freeman, for sure.\n\n01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.040\nMorgan Freeman, if I can put it.\n\n01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:47.360\nNo.\n\n01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.560\nAre you talking now or then?\n\n01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.040\nOh, then, I guess.\n\n01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:52.080\nRed Fox.\n\n01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.280\nRed Fox?\n\n01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:53.840\nOh, Red Fox.\n\n01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.760\nWe could sell this tomorrow.\n\n01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.800\nIf it were 30 years ago.\n\n01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.280\nExactly.\n\n01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.440\nAll right, so.\n\n01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.640\nWe could sell this yesterday.\n\n01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.960\nAll right, so you'd be Red Fox as a Poop Deck Pappy.\n\n01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.800\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.520\nI'm not going to be there.\n\n01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.560\nAll right.\n\n01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.600\nJeff, please do all the characters.\n\n01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.880\nHispanic Hogan's Heroes.\n\n01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.200\nHogan, you dick!\n\n01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.440\nAll right, great.\n\n01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.600\nYo, you locked us up in your homes?\n\n01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.960\nFucking let us out, dick!\n\n01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.640\nI know some things.\n\n01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.120\nI don't know why you would know more than this.\n\n01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.080\nAll right, okay.\n\n01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.840\nJump down your bed.\n\n01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.200\nI'm sorry, Davis.\n\n01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:37.680\nI didn't.\n\n01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:38.960\nEskimo Hitler.\n\n01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:39.760\nEskimo Hitler?\n\n01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:42.880\nEskimo Hitler.\n\n01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.200\nHe's cold, but he's mad.\n\n01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:53.920\nHe's really cold.\n\n01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.880\nHe's cold, but he's mad.\n\n01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.400\nAll right.\n\n01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:02.480\nWell, welcome to the Puerto Rican Churchill.\n\n01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.440\nI feel like my heart is shivering.\n\n01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.520\nEverything's getting nervous.\n\n01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.200\nGive me some Puerto Rican Churchill.\n\n01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.920\nI speak softly in homes and carry big stick homes.\n\n01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.680\nThat's Roosevelt, you fucking liar.\n\n01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.720\nAll right, fine.\n\n01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.320\nAlligator Lincoln.\n\n01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.880\nAbraham Lincoln, but he's an alligator.\n\n01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.440\nAlligator.\n\n01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.160\nHe's an alligator.\n\n01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.120\nHas an alligator.\n\n01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:38.480\nOkay, first score, seven eggs ago.\n\n01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.640\nSeven eggs ago?\n\n01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.120\nHow do you think Crock-n-Roll's Bizarre Time?\n\n01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.320\nAlligators.\n\n01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.480\nMy eggs, all right.\n\n01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.440\nSarah, give me,\n\n01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:55.760\nI want, let's see, Dan, give her one.\n\n01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:56.480\nGive Sarah one.\n\n01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.120\nThrow one on her.\n\n01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.240\nElvis as a robot.\n\n01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:05.920\nRobot Elvis, Sarah.\n\n01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:08.880\nOkay.\n\n01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:25.280\nOkay, Sarah, just say, you ain't nothing but a hound dog and a robot voice.\n\n01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.640\nYou are no longer a hound, all right.\n\n01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.200\nThat was actually a really good Elvis, yeah.\n\n01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.040\nAll right, yeah.\n\n01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.760\nOkay, so we should probably roll into the D&D.\n\n01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.240\nWhat do we got?\n\n01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.600\nWe got everybody we need.\n\n01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.000\nSo we should probably say goodbye to, good night to Sarah.\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.280\nNo, Rob, you got to play D&D.\n\n01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.160\nShe was a bartender.\n\n01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.760\nShe's walking around with like 200 bucks.\n\n01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.640\nNo, she can stay, but we can bring somebody else to play.\n\n01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.280\nI thought I was going to help Spencer tonight.\n\n01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.000\nOh.\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.680\nRight now we should have enough people for D&D in general, right?\n\n01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.000\nI mean, four players.\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.280\nWe talked in the green room about Rob being the dungeon master's helper.\n\n01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.960\nI don't think that Spencer was involved in that conversation.\n\n01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.120\nNo, I think it would be cool.\n\n01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.760\nLet's try it out.\n\n01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.000\nRob as Spencer's assistant.\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.160\nWell, then we'd need another player.\n\n01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.120\nIs Woolly Roberts here?\n\n01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.360\nWoolly Roberts come to the stage.\n\n01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:21.920\nWould you join us?\n\n01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.920\nAll right, so we're saying goodbye to Sarah.\n\n01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.720\nThanks, Sarah.\n\n01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.520\nThank you, Sarah.\n\n01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.560\nThank you, Sarah.\n\n01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:36.160\nBut Sarah, if I want another drink, you'll still be in the room, right?\n\n01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.000\nNo, she's done.\n\n01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.400\nSarah's over.\n\n01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:41.680\nWow.\n\n01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.880\nMy reign has begun.\n\n01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.000\nI think earlier we were trying to talk about Skyscraper Skip, right?\n\n01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:49.760\nSkyscraper.\n\n01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.120\nYay.\n\n01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.040\nWoolly Roberts, everybody, from the Real Life Sci-Fi, what's it called?\n\n01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.480\nThe Real Life Sci-Fi podcast, which is quite fucking good fun.\n\n01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:06.640\nSo I dig that. Also, Woolly is the clan leader of my Clash of Clans clan, and he is...\n\n01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.760\nSo you've got to come up with a better title for that position.\n\n01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.520\nWhat about Grand Dragon?\n\n01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.040\nDungeons and Grand Dragons.\n\n01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:27.360\nAll right, so Spencer or Rob, as Spencer's assistant, it's your job to dispense the\n\n01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.200\ncharacter sheets for us.\n\n01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:29.440\nYes.\n\n01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.000\nI heard someone gasp at that.\n\n01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.920\nErin, you weren't here last week, but Demorge played Dignity Sarsgard to great effect as Obama.\n\n01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:47.040\nAnd I'm assuming that Willie will be Chris de Burgh.\n\n01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.440\nThere's no way he's doing that, right?\n\n01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.680\nThere's no way. I mean, I got Sharpie.\n\n01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.160\nI don't know whose that is.\n\n01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.080\nSo Rob, look at the names on the top of them.\n\n01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.760\nThat one's Dan, yep.\n\n01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.680\nAdventure. This is for Dan.\n\n01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.440\nHead up to Dan.\n\n01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.080\nThis is a nightmare.\n\n01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.240\nRob, you're doing it wrong. You're doing it wrong.\n\n01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.960\nThis is an edit point for Dustin.\n\n01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.680\nSpencer, do Turtle George Washington?\n\n01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:22.800\nUh, let's see. What did George Washington do?\n\n01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.760\nHe sailed across the Seven Seas.\n\n01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.720\nYes, that was exactly what he did.\n\n01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.440\nLet's...\n\n01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.720\nFor you and the booth, I'm a...\n\n01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.280\nMurderer.\n\n01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.720\nI'm swapping mics so that my...\n\n01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.480\nThat's my way of reaching Sharp, so...\n\n01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:35.600\nThere we go.\n\n01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.920\nOn Christmas Day.\n\n01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.280\nAll right, so edit point back in.\n\n01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:39.840\nAll right, Spencer, we have...\n\n01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.560\nThat happened, right?\n\n01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.040\nDidn't they murder a bunch of British people on Christmas?\n\n01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:43.360\nNo.\n\n01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:53.120\nNo. Either way, either way, Grace7Truth.org, Grace7Truth.org.\n\n01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.680\nAlso, while this is being all ridiculous,\n\n01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.840\nI'm going to be up in Pittsburgh, I think,\n\n01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.240\nSeptember 19th or something that weekend.\n\n01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.200\nYou have dates now?\n\n01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.160\nI have a date.\n\n01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.920\nThis is the first date I'll ever have.\n\n01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.440\nLast one, too.\n\n01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:08.720\nI'll be at...\n\n01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.320\nThis thing is called Knights of the Arcade.\n\n01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.040\nIt's basically an elongated version of the D&D\n\n01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.560\npot thing that we do here,\n\n01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.720\nbut they wanted me to come guess it up.\n\n01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.160\nElongated?\n\n01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:21.600\nYeah, it's like...\n\n01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.440\nThe whole session is like a D&D.\n\n01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.240\nSo it's 10 hours?\n\n01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.600\nIt's like 10 hours.\n\n01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.520\nIt's a real marathon,\n\n01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.360\nbut we provide free water,\n\n01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.720\nand it's a great time.\n\n01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.560\nIf any of you guys who live in LA are out in Philadelphia...\n\n01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.840\nWhat did I say, Pittsburgh?\n\n01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:38.400\nPittsburgh.\n\n01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.760\nI don't know where places are.\n\n01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.200\nHome of the sandwich.\n\n01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.640\nWhat?\n\n01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.600\nHome of the sandwich.\n\n01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.600\nIt's by the Monongahila and the...\n\n01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.720\nWhatever the fuck, Rivers.\n\n01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.240\nHome of the sandwich.\n\n01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.600\nAll right, so Spencer,\n\n01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.680\nWillie, you're going to be Christopher.\n\n01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.480\nHe's a rogue and a thief,\n\n01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.800\nand he wrote one hit.\n\n01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.160\nHe wrote Lady in Red.\n\n01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.360\nAaron has become Dignity Sarsgaard,\n\n01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.120\nwho last time was Obama, our president.\n\n01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.760\nSpencer, do you want to take us away?\n\n01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.080\nI feel like maybe Rob should take it away.\n\n01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.440\nYeah.\n\n01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.120\nRead that first top paragraph.\n\n01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.560\nSo, I don't have my glasses.\n\n01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.960\nOh, man, get ready.\n\n01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:29.600\nWe are ready.\n\n01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.200\nWhen last we met our heroes,\n\n01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.600\nwe're just outside the juicery,\n\n01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.160\nwhere...\n\n01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.520\nI can't pronounce that word.\n\n01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.160\nWhat is that?\n\n01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:42.960\nDarm von.\n\n01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.360\nDarm von, the drunken knight accused\n\n01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.360\nthe local priest of misdeeds\n\n01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.800\nand fell upon his own blade.\n\n01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.840\nFather Tinder reacted by calling off\n\n01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:52.800\nthe Jewish tourer,\n\n01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:55.360\nwanting to inform the wife and the kids,\n\n01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.240\nbut Sharpie insisted that they do it,\n\n01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.000\nsparing him the trouble\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.200\nand headed to Mrs...\n\n01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:02.640\nDarm von.\n\n01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:02.880\nDon...\n\n01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.400\nDarm von.\n\n01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.200\nOh, shit, I scrolled down.\n\n01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.640\nTake over, tag out.\n\n01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.720\nMrs. Darm von's home,\n\n01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.760\nwhere they broke the news\n\n01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:16.800\nand looked for clues,\n\n01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:19.280\nconvinced that the father was up to no good.\n\n01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.120\nMeanwhile, Dignity and Chris de Burgh\n\n01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.640\nwent back to the constabulary\n\n01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.160\nand met with Spizzbulb,\n\n01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.000\nBulb, the gnome they had saved.\n\n01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.080\nThey were immediately suspicious of Spizzbulb\n\n01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.200\nwhen thoughts sought to flee,\n\n01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.480\nbut the party reunited\n\n01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.520\nafter Mrs. Darm von\n\n01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.440\nspermed Sharpie's advances.\n\n01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.560\nWith Sharpie and Quark,\n\n01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.520\nthe gang retired and conspired\n\n01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.920\nand drew up a plan to break\n\n01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.360\ninto Father Tinder's house,\n\n01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.920\nhoping to find incriminating evidence.\n\n01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.840\nBut what would our heroes uncover?\n\n01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.440\nWhat evils may they face?\n\n01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.520\nWhat laws would they be breaking?\n\n01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.120\nFind out now, time.\n\n01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:52.720\nTeamwork!\n\n01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.560\nYou know, you never realize\n\n01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.880\nthat you think they might be good at something\n\n01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.320\nuntil you see someone else.\n\n01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.440\nWhat, what, what the?\n\n01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.560\nI didn't bring my glasses.\n\n01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.080\nYou sure didn't, you sure didn't.\n\n01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.240\nI can't read with the shape that small.\n\n01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.120\nYou sure can't.\n\n01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:11.520\nWhat kind of...\n\n01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.320\nIt's not fair.\n\n01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.000\nIt's not fair.\n\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:14.400\nNo, it's God.\n\n01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.800\nYou don't do notes in the middle of a show.\n\n01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.440\nOh, I do.\n\n01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:19.360\nWho's not fair?\n\n01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:19.920\nIt's not cool.\n\n01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.440\nThe college hears themselves as\n\n01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.040\nassistant Dungeon Master.\n\n01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:23.760\nAssistant?\n\n01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.040\nNot Dungeon Master?\n\n01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.480\nBring...\n\n01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.760\nYou said my glasses.\n\n01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.080\nI didn't know I was coming up.\n\n01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.280\nYou didn't tell me.\n\n01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.320\nYeah, I didn't tell him.\n\n01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.600\nI snuck him in.\n\n01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:34.720\nI just, you know.\n\n01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.600\nAll right, Suspenser.\n\n01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.680\nIt's me and\n\n01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.120\nChris de Burgh\n\n01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.000\nor Dignity breaking into the house right now.\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:42.640\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.960\nYou guys, you guys are all, yeah.\n\n01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:45.920\nOkay.\n\n01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.280\nSo it's just nighttime.\n\n01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.120\nYou guys just left Spizzbulb's house.\n\n01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.040\nHe gave you a black bundle of cloth\n\n01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.080\nand you guys were gonna sneak into Tinder's house.\n\n01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.920\nAnd the bundle of cloth,\n\n01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.440\nhe didn't specify what it was.\n\n01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.280\nHe said use this in case of emergency,\n\n01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.200\nbut also if you use it by the border\n\n01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.320\nor by the barrier,\n\n01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.360\nthat bad things would happen.\n\n01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.560\nDon't leave town with it, I think.\n\n01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.920\nIt'll break, yeah.\n\n01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:07.360\nIf the barrier's turned on.\n\n01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.760\nBut it'll be good in case of emergency\n\n01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.440\nwithin the boundaries of that thing.\n\n01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.160\nThat's what he said.\n\n01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.760\nHe didn't really say that much about it,\n\n01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.240\nto be honest.\n\n01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.200\nBut that was the implication.\n\n01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:15.680\nYep.\n\n01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.560\nThat was the inference.\n\n01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:19.760\nOkay, so where are we standing right now?\n\n01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.400\nYou guys are right outside of Spizzbulb's tower,\n\n01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.240\njust kind of in Rosebook in general.\n\n01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.440\nIt's really late at night,\n\n01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.120\nlike maybe one o'clock, you know.\n\n01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.880\nWell, you and Chris de Burgh\n\n01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.080\nare the stealthy ones.\n\n01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:34.080\nSo, I mean, I could come with,\n\n01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.440\nbut I should keep a perimeter.\n\n01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.040\nBut we're about to break into\n\n01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.240\nFather Tender's crib right now, right?\n\n01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.200\nRight, yeah.\n\n01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.800\nOkay, so it's me and...\n\n01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:42.880\nAnd DeBerg.\n\n01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.000\nAnd Chris de Burgh.\n\n01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.600\nWe're gonna go in and break into this guy's house.\n\n01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:48.400\nWe think he has a power shard.\n\n01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.440\nAnd we're gonna go break into this guy's house.\n\n01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.920\nI have a teleport cape.\n\n01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.200\nI can't do Kumail, sorry.\n\n01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.160\nCan I bring somebody with me?\n\n01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:01.600\nI want you to commit to doing a bad Kumail, I suppose.\n\n01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.680\nCommit to being a bad Pakistani.\n\n01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.480\nWho has a teleport cape?\n\n01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.360\nAccording to my gear, I've got a teleport cape.\n\n01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.080\nI feel like you must have Dan's item sheet.\n\n01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.400\nHow did that happen?\n\n01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:14.960\nI don't know.\n\n01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.200\nWhat kind of circus are you running here?\n\n01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.000\nOh, goodness.\n\n01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.040\nSorry, I just...\n\n01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.440\nChris de Burgh definitely doesn't have one of those.\n\n01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.000\nYep.\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.920\nAll right, so, Chris, here's the deal.\n\n01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.760\nI examine the house to look for entrances and exits and stuff.\n\n01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.600\nYou see the juicery?\n\n01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.760\nIt's a low-ceiling, rectangular building\n\n01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.080\nattached to a larger cylindrical building.\n\n01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.000\nThat's like a normal house,\n\n01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.640\nso it's like the juicery is attached to the house.\n\n01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.520\nYou see the juicery?\n\n01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.760\nIt's got these fine stained glass windows\n\n01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.800\ndepicting roses and fruits and decanters and mugs\n\n01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.160\nin great detail.\n\n01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.320\nThe rest of the building is dressed in roses\n\n01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.320\nas is tradition around Rosebook.\n\n01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.720\nSo, one of the buildings is where the juice is made.\n\n01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.560\nThe other one is where Tinder is.\n\n01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:58.960\nThe fudges.\n\n01:21:58.960 --> 01:21:59.360\nYeah.\n\n01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.520\nThat's around the corner.\n\n01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.280\nOne's for milk and one's for lemonade.\n\n01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:03.760\nYeah.\n\n01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.160\nIf you go around the corner, I think it's fudges.\n\n01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.040\nThat's like fudges.\n\n01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.880\nIf I put on my goggles of night, do I see anything else?\n\n01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.280\nYou can see all sorts of stuff.\n\n01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.800\nThat was Rob Schrab helping.\n\n01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.840\nEeeeeee.\n\n01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.200\nSo, yeah, you put on your goggles of night\n\n01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.280\nand you can see clearly in the darkness,\n\n01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.600\nyou can see into the juicery where metal and wooden devices\n\n01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.160\nlie dormant inside the juicery.\n\n01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.840\nI go towards the dwelling where Father Tinder lives.\n\n01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:38.960\nAll right, you do that.\n\n01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.040\nYou see, well, I mean, they're attached.\n\n01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.080\nIt's like the same building.\n\n01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:42.400\nOkay.\n\n01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.600\nThere's two parts of it.\n\n01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.280\nChristopher, you probably have a...\n\n01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.680\nI can turn invisible.\n\n01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.280\nYou can turn invisible?\n\n01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:49.680\nYeah.\n\n01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.320\nWell, do that, but also you have probably a Thieves kit\n\n01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.360\nwhere you can break into,\n\n01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.480\nsilently break into like a lock and open a door, right?\n\n01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.040\nOkay.\n\n01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.080\nHey, yeah.\n\n01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.120\nGuys, remember, Sharpie, what are you doing here?\n\n01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.880\nI can't go any further than this.\n\n01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.240\nYou're going to wait by the van.\n\n01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.520\nI can't go any further.\n\n01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.720\nHe had it in his breast pocket.\n\n01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.680\nLike he patted his breast when he was talking about God's day.\n\n01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.600\nOkay, but I'm slinking back.\n\n01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:13.840\nOkay.\n\n01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.080\nWe go up to the door.\n\n01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.120\nChris, oh, pick that lock.\n\n01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:19.760\nThat's God's day.\n\n01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.760\nI'm going to turn invisible, pick the lock,\n\n01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:24.720\nand then look for a breast pocket.\n\n01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.080\nSo a prom night.\n\n01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.000\nThat's what they call...\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:30.880\nThat's Steve Tom.\n\n01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.160\nThat's him turning invisible.\n\n01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.000\nWhat's him picking the lock?\n\n01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:39.760\nWhat?\n\n01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:49.920\nWhat's him picking the lock sound like?\n\n01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.920\nAnd just like that, the lock is open.\n\n01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.280\nRoger Huebner is in the house.\n\n01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:56.640\nThe lock was a cat's mouth.\n\n01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:02.720\nRob, can you open the door,\n\n01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:14.160\nbut also do a chainsaw and a lawn mower at the same time?\n\n01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:14.960\nPretty amazing.\n\n01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.440\nThat's a joke for three people.\n\n01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:19.680\nI don't get it.\n\n01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:23.040\nThere was a sound effects guy at Comedy Sports in Milwaukee,\n\n01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.440\nand he's passed now.\n\n01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:25.920\nHe was a...\n\n01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:26.880\nHilarious.\n\n01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.680\nHe would do sound effects on them.\n\n01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.120\nThe referee for Comedy Sports would say,\n\n01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.120\nRoger could do three sound effects at the same time,\n\n01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:35.200\nbut the three sound effects were always...\n\n01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.480\nLike, give me the three sound effects.\n\n01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.400\nThis is what it sounded like every night.\n\n01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.320\nOkay, give me three sound effects.\n\n01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.840\nThe three sound effects are...\n\n01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.280\nRoger, I'm going to...\n\n01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.360\nIt was...\n\n01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.640\nI'm trying to think of what the three were.\n\n01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:48.880\nIt was...\n\n01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.400\nI'm going to start a vacuum cleaner,\n\n01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.880\nand then I'm going to start an electric can opener,\n\n01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.080\nand then a chainsaw.\n\n01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:58.560\nAll right.\n\n01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.000\nI think you're going to have to act it out for me to do mine.\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.920\nSo here we go, starting with the vacuum cleaner.\n\n01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.280\nElectric can opener.\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:12.640\nChainsaw.\n\n01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.920\nAmazing!\n\n01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.280\nPeople would go crazy.\n\n01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.640\nIf you've never heard a man hum,\n\n01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.560\nthen hum louder, then fart.\n\n01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.160\nWell, it's nice that he has a legacy.\n\n01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.800\nR.A.P., wherever you are.\n\n01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.000\nRest in peace, Roger Haberler.\n\n01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.320\nHe died in the sound booth.\n\n01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.000\nOh, really?\n\n01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.360\nDid he really?\n\n01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.680\nHe died on the job?\n\n01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:56.800\nYeah.\n\n01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.760\nDid they record it?\n\n01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.480\nNo.\n\n01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.760\nAnd I'm not making a joke about this.\n\n01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.200\nThis is not funny at all!\n\n01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.280\nStop down and be emotional about this.\n\n01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.880\nThey buried him with his microphone.\n\n01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.080\nThat's great.\n\n01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.240\nI got to meet him, and I heard him do the thing in the sound effect,\n\n01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.680\nand I was like, that's fucking great.\n\n01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.200\nAnd they called him Mr. Voice, right?\n\n01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.560\nMr. Voice?\n\n01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.640\nI think that's the only thing he didn't have.\n\n01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.840\nI think he did. Mr. Sound Effects, probably. Mr. Mouth?\n\n01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.400\nMouth.\n\n01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:27.920\nWe called our guy Comedy Sports on A, Mr. Voice.\n\n01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.360\nMouth and a microphone alone.\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.760\nBut he was like, he would make...\n\n01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.400\nA lot of the sound effects sound as wet.\n\n01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.440\nYeah.\n\n01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.960\nSo I'm going to make a peanut butter sandwich.\n\n01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.240\nThey sound very fart-like.\n\n01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:42.880\nYes.\n\n01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:44.080\nThat's the peanut butter sandwich.\n\n01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.400\nAll right, so Spencer...\n\n01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.080\nYou want...\n\n01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.280\nChristopher?\n\n01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.960\nWould you want to unlock the door again?\n\n01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:51.280\nYes.\n\n01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:51.840\nYes.\n\n01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:52.480\nAh, I...\n\n01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.000\nChristopher, we've already opened the door, right?\n\n01:26:59.040 --> 01:26:59.440\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.640\nOkay, so I creep in and examine the surroundings inside the doorway.\n\n01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:08.640\nYeah, yeah, you do that.\n\n01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.920\nAnd inside you see several strange contraptions.\n\n01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.280\nWooden racks with handles and gears and great wheels.\n\n01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.680\nThe walls of the juicery are lined with barrels,\n\n01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.320\neach with roses affixed to the lids and sides.\n\n01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.520\nYou see drums of apples, oranges, grapes,\n\n01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.000\nraspberries, bananas, pineapples,\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.040\nand even the most sinister fruit of all, the pear.\n\n01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.160\nThere's a small wooden hatch in the floor\n\n01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.600\nand a small wooden barred gate\n\n01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.000\njoining the juicery and the house part of the building.\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.640\nI go to the hatch and tell Chris to try to quietly open it.\n\n01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:41.120\nWhich one?\n\n01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:41.680\nWhich one?\n\n01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.160\nThe hatch.\n\n01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:42.800\nIn the floor?\n\n01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.120\nYes.\n\n01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:43.760\nAll right.\n\n01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:44.480\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.560\nI'm going to quietly open it\n\n01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.320\nand then drop my robot baby in there.\n\n01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:49.840\nOkay.\n\n01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:52.960\nJust that's, I'm not discouraging that at all,\n\n01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:55.200\nbut I mean, it's made of metal\n\n01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:56.720\nand dropping that would make noise.\n\n01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.880\nI mean, do it anyway.\n\n01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:01.920\nWe're trying to break in at night to rob a shard\n\n01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:04.000\noff a guy's sleeping breast pocket.\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.440\nBut what would it sound like?\n\n01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.280\nYou don't know it might not be that loud.\n\n01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.680\nWe can't afford to make noises right now, Chris.\n\n01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.960\nIt might not be that loud.\n\n01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:21.760\nWe open the hatch and this is the hatch\n\n01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.240\nthat adjoins the juicery to the house.\n\n01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.240\nWell, if it's the hatch in the floor, it doesn't.\n\n01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:28.640\nThere's a door and a hatch.\n\n01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:30.560\nWe go to the door.\n\n01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.520\nI want the shard.\n\n01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.560\nI don't care about the juicery.\n\n01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:33.440\nAll right.\n\n01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.240\nYou open, wait, wait, you go to the door?\n\n01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.040\nYes.\n\n01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.480\nYou go to the door.\n\n01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:39.120\nIt's locked.\n\n01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.120\nChris, use your thieves kit.\n\n01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.560\nI'd like to use my thieves kit\n\n01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:47.760\nand unlock the door while admiring my dragon dick.\n\n01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:48.960\nYeah.\n\n01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.000\nWell, it's not on you.\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.320\nIt's just, I think it's in your bag or whatever.\n\n01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.240\nI'll still look at it.\n\n01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:54.480\nYeah.\n\n01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:56.080\nIt gives you focus.\n\n01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.480\nIt's like an energy drink.\n\n01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.760\nBut yeah, well, that's not, I mean, that's a weird reaction.\n\n01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.960\nAnyway, you do it.\n\n01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:05.600\nIt opens.\n\n01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.080\nChris, Chris, you've got your,\n\n01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:16.240\nyour goggles on, your low light vision stuff.\n\n01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:17.760\nYeah.\n\n01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.320\nLead the way.\n\n01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.040\nTell me what you see.\n\n01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.920\nI lead the way and tell Jeff what I see.\n\n01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:25.040\nQuark.\n\n01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.160\nThat's right.\n\n01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.040\nWhat is that noise?\n\n01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:29.840\nThat's his vision.\n\n01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.040\nThat's his little light goggles.\n\n01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.080\nThose sound different.\n\n01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.880\nThis room is a combination sitting in dining room,\n\n01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.400\na wooden chair or a wooden table with chairs dominates half\n\n01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.680\nand a small fireplace with nicer cushion chairs dominates\n\n01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.560\nthe other half.\n\n01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:48.400\nYou see a small door and also a small enclosed stairwell\n\n01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.760\nleading to the second floor.\n\n01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:53.280\nThe cushions from the chairs.\n\n01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.440\nWe're going to attach those to our shoes.\n\n01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:55.920\nAll right.\n\n01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:56.240\nOkay.\n\n01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:02.240\nWe, we, we make, we, we, Rob.\n\n01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.040\nWhat does that sound like?\n\n01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.560\nWe fashion cushion shoes.\n\n01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.520\nOptimus Prime just came in.\n\n01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:14.240\nYeah.\n\n01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:18.240\nAll right.\n\n01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.560\nYou guys are playing a CD-ROM video game for kids from the 90s.\n\n01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:23.680\nAll right.\n\n01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.720\nI feel like he was probably sleeping upstairs\n\n01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.880\nbecause the bedroom and the house like this would probably be upstairs.\n\n01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:38.080\nI, I, I, I use my ears, my, my, my, my Noma here is to,\n\n01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:40.240\nto detect where the snoring is coming from Spencer.\n\n01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.320\nIt's coming from upstairs.\n\n01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:42.640\nAll right.\n\n01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:47.200\nI, I, I creep, I creep up first and I draw,\n\n01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:51.200\nand I, I, I draw, um, what's my smallest weapon?\n\n01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.560\nI draw like a, like a dagger or something.\n\n01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:53.680\nProbably a dagger, yeah.\n\n01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:53.840\nYeah.\n\n01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.840\nI, I draw a dagger and walk up the stairs.\n\n01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:58.480\nOkay.\n\n01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:01.440\nSo before you can get up those stairs, you hear,\n\n01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.120\nyou hear a noise.\n\n01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.000\nThe stomping of feet and the breaking of glass.\n\n01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:06.960\nActually.\n\n01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:13.840\nSmash, reverse order.\n\n01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:16.000\nYou hear smashing a glass and then,\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.320\nand then, and then the breaking of the feeding.\n\n01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:22.480\nThat's what you hear.\n\n01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.680\nThat sounded much better.\n\n01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:25.680\nI'm sorry folks.\n\n01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:28.080\nThen from upstairs you hear a, no, no.\n\n01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:39.920\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.560\nOh, he's good.\n\n01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:45.360\nUm, I, I, I charge up the stairs and kick in the door.\n\n01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:49.440\nUpstairs you find Father Tinder, Tinder,\n\n01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.520\nsprawled out on the floor covered in blood\n\n01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.440\nthat streams from his mouth and face.\n\n01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:54.080\nWhat?\n\n01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.440\nHe groans weakly.\n\n01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:59.440\nAre you saying that we've fucking missed this\n\n01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.360\nbecause we tied cushions to our feet?\n\n01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.560\nHe, he groans weakly.\n\n01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:07.600\nAs if in pain.\n\n01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.320\nDo we see, do we see the attacker?\n\n01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.840\nUh, wait, do you?\n\n01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:15.520\nYep.\n\n01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:19.600\nA shadowy figure wielding a thin fencing foil\n\n01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.680\nis escaping through the broken window\n\n01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:23.360\nand out to the juicery roof.\n\n01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:25.680\nI lunge toward him with my dagger in
