WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
One, two, three, two, off!

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Welcome, one and all, to Meltdown Connors in Hollywood, California.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Thank you. Wow.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Thank you for coming out on a holiday weekend.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Alright, Jeff, we got a lot to do tonight.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Let's get down to business, Harmont.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Okay, so, society corner.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Do you want a theme for that, or no?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Do you want to jump in?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
She got one handy.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Let's do...

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Society corner.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
It's some advice about how to run a society.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
It's a corner where that society lives.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Society corner.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Society corner time.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
It's about how to run a society.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
How to run a society where the society lives.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
It's called society corner.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Corner corner.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Okay.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, we've got them training to expect less.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
You guys understand, the show is improvised.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Right this shit.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I know it comes off like a highly polished gem,

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
but this is completely just off the cuff.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Okay, so...

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
I'm making up no expressions.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
It's off the shit.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Spencer, our Dungeon Master, came up with...

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
and I were driving along.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Spencer is also my chauffeur.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
He's my Dungeon Master chauffeur and B-assistant,

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
as opposed to A-assistant, not like apiary.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Wait a minute.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Is that right?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Apiary?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Is that B?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Okay.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
But we came up with this when we were watching a fire truck drive by us.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
We were talking about, okay, there's fire trucks.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
What is it like to be a fireman?

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
And they sit in that station and they wait for fire alarms.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
And a lot of times it's like somebody that's been hurt.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
They're the first response, often the paramedics on board.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
If somebody just loses a foot or something,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
not on fire at all, they're the first there.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
So Spencer and I came up with a new pitch,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
and if you're listening and you work for civic government,

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
please take this to heart.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Firefighters should leave for fires earlier

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
by not getting dressed at the station.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
They should take their fire gear with them.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Leave the station earlier, thereby increasing chances

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
of getting to a fire when it's smaller.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
And if they need to get dressed, they can do it on site.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Same amount of time increased the chances of catching a fire when it's smaller.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
And of course, there's the people that lost a foot

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
and it's not on fire at all.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Just show up in a shirt and jeans.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Take care of it.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Is there a fire?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Oh, let's put on our rubber pants.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Now, the taxpayers would appreciate a good show.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Oh, they're getting in their rubber pants.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Don't do that in the station.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
You don't know where you're going.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
You don't know how big the fire is.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Get the fire truck over to the fire.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
It might be tiny right now.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
That's a very good idea.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Do you think that when the dispatch comes out for a call

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
and they go, hey, we got a guy, he has a broken foot,

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
they don't get full fire gear, do they?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I don't know.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I don't know how it works, but there's room for improvement.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
In my mind, because you see them driving to things

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
and there's the hook and ladder and there's a dude in the back.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
He has his pants on, but he has like a t-shirt on with the suspenders.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
And you know what, they wear those, right?

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
I think I've heard that.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
But yeah, I think it's a very sound idea.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Okay.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
All right, so I don't know if you want to spend time

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
on this bartender concept.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
We were talking to the green room.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
We brought it up.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Last week we talked about, oh, wouldn't it be nice

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
to have what we're calling a bartender,

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
but that does not mean anything legally definable.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
We're worried about the idea that it might be illegal

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
in some way for meltdown,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
but we're not going to have somebody up here

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
serving drinks to the audience

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
and being paid for that service,

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
because that would be against the Alcohol Beverage Commission.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Also, the person, and I'm not kidding about this,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
they wouldn't be handling liquor at all.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
They could just be an ice tender.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Ice tender?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah, they could just put ice in the cups.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
There's only one booze up here.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Who's going to pour the vodka?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
No, we would have the vodka.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
The hard part is the ice.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
The hard part is that it interrupts the show

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
when people are putting microphones down

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
to deal with alcohol.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Ice. It's the ice.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
It's easy to pour vodka into a cup.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I've done it a thousand times.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
It's hard to get the ice happening up here.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Would we get in legal trouble if somebody was over here

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
making me a vodka on the rocks?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Making you a vodka on the rocks?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
That I don't know, but I know for sure it's totally legal

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
for someone to put ice in a cup

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
and hand it to an alcoholic who has

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
his own designs on the cup.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
They could still be a bartender.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
It's just a bar of ice.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Then we sidestep all of the municipal issues.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Then you're going to want to still stop

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
and open up the bottle and then pour it in?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
I think that this conversation

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
is putting ice in the cup of the evening.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
I was just trying to help make it faster.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I don't want anyone to get arrested.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I don't want...

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I think we just have somebody make you drinks.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
All right, okay.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
We're not charging for it.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Basically, if Camille came out here

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
and you said, hey, Camille,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
would you, while I'm talking,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
would you grab a cup with some ice in it

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
and throw a little vodka on top of it?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I don't think we get in trouble.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
We're just meeting a new friend that's going to do that service.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
How do we meet that person tonight?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
That's a conversation we have to have now.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Who traveled the farthest?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
This guy.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Nashville? Can somebody beat Nashville?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
North Carolina.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
South Florida.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
You're China?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
South Florida?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Versus Australia.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Australia wins.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Australia, get up here.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
If you want.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Putzman!

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
If this is a stunt,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
you better be willing to fake one of the hardest accents there is.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
It's deceptively hard, mate.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I've tried it.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Crocodile, mate.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Come up here and grab a microphone.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Come on up here, young lady.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Grab yourself a mic. What's your name?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
My name is Sarah.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Sarah?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Say something with an Australian accent.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
My name is Sarah.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I'm from Australia.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
You don't sound particularly Australian.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You came here from Australia?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Yeah, bloody earth I did.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Wait, but like, you came to the show from Australia?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Do you live here for the last seven years?

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
No, no, I'm from Australia.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Going back there.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
You came here for the show?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
No, no.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, we wouldn't really want to live in that world.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Then this is a terrible show.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
She came here on a 15-hour flight.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Alright, Sarah, one of my favorite things about Australians,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
and I have a lot of Aussie friends,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
is that they make the word N-O.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
No, a three- or four-syllable word.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Say yes or...

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
No.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
No? That's good.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
That's also always a question, no?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
That's very convincing.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
That's a good Australian ID.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
She's either Australian or she's Meryl Streep.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
That's great.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
In either case, welcome.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
What was your name again?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Sarah.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Where do you want to situate her?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I think for now...

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Let's have her just sit in that seat closest to the ice bucket, right?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Okay.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Maybe between Spencer's table and...

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
The one over there.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
The stage right chair, Sarah.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
You also offered to pay for this, right?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
This is a paying gig.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Oh, sure. Let's see what I got.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
I'll chip in, too.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
What do we say?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You want to go with the price?

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
Well, I said $100, but I meant Australian.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
What is the exchange on the Australian dollar right now, do you know?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I just know that whatever you offer somebody there,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
they say that's not that currency,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
and then they pull out a bigger form of currency and say,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
that's that form of currency.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
20, 40, 60, 80...

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
It's amazing that people still get that reference.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
It's so funny the things that make it through the sandstorms of time.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Sometimes I make references here.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
To the disco ball lady in dance hall days,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
everyone was just stone faced.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
What are you talking about, grandpa?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
But then for some reason,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
we're all going to just permanently retain Paul Hogan's

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
three-year stardom in the United States.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
It was very culturally impacted.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
I only have $15. Can I chip in that?

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Yeah, I have like 80. We're getting close to our mark.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Do I have this?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
80.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I have $17.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
85.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
We're going to put that close to 100.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
95.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
There you go.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
That should be...

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
That's it.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
$100, paid in advance.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
Okay, this show is like hitting the ground running.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Sarah, I'd like a drink.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
He likes vodka on the rocks, so let's...

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Let's see what happens.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Now we're allowed to just ask you for a drink, right?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
It's not going to be a bullish thing for me to say,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Sarah, get off your ass and give me a drink.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
No, yeah. We own her now.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
We've subjugated her.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
That's the easiest $100 anyone's going to make.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
I'm going to make it fucking so hard on you, Sarah.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
You're going to wish you'd never moved from Australia to here.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
You're going to wish you said, nah.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
All right, so I don't know how long we can continue to delay this.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
We have a superstar in the wings tonight.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
We have an internet superstar.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Do we really?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I was backstage. I didn't see any.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Oh, I forgot.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
We do have a man that might have changed social media for good.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah, I guess...

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Let's just bring him up and get to it.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
Please welcome the inventor of what salon.com calls Schrabbing.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Rob Schrabb.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Thank you, sir.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
gorgeous. Perfect.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Sarah says she brought me a vodka in the rocks,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
and she wanted to make sure that it was to my liking.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
It has equal parts vodka and ice.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
So, Schrabb.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Yes, Davis.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
What started as you haranguing our producer, Dustin Marshall, on Twitter,

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
or Instagram, by just...

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
I got good at it.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
You got really good at it.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Take us through the rich history that is Schrabbing.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Like, how do we get to this place?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
We're salons writing.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
What I would call a very Woodford...

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Woodward and Bernstein's article.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
It really got to the bottom of it.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah, or not.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I'll give you another choice.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
You can explain why, when you woke up during your colonoscopy,

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
that you chose to pretend to stay asleep.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Wait, what?

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Let's talk about either of these things.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Okay, I'll talk about the colonoscopy.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Because I don't really know an answer to that.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Your question.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah, it started off as a thing and then became...

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
The Schrabbing phenomenon, if we can call it a phenomenon,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
which I believe now we can, right?

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
I'm not going to make that bold of a statement.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
What blows my mind about Schrabbing is that everybody now tries to Schrab a Schrab.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
You can't...

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
You can't Schrab a Schrab.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
You can't Schrab a Schrab.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
You can't do it.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
But also, it seems like an easy bit.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Seems easy.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
But everybody does it wrong.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Deceptively.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
It's like the Australian accent.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
You also said that a lot of people,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
because the headline of the article was like the king of trolls,

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
that there's a lot of people just trying to now just troll you.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Do you throw me?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
They'll tweet to me and it's like,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
hey, Schrab, you're a piece of shit.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Why don't you go kill yourself?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Try saying smart to that.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Didn't think so.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
I didn't become the king of trolls, I'm quote, air quotes,

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
king of trolls by dethrowing the other king of trolls.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
There was no guy before you.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
That was like Johnsoning.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah, there's not prison yard rules.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
You don't take down the troll.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
You do it.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
You put in the hours.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
You work hard.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
And you're just a business.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
You're a work-a-day troll.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah, yeah.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
No, you do put a lot of elbow grease into it.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
How many followers did you gain, like a zillion followers?

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
I had like 15,000.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Like, thank you.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
It was one person with 15,000.

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
And then after like the podcast,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I went up to like 20,000.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I got like 19 now.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
This was 5,000 people.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Yeah, in like two weeks.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
All right, colonoscopy.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Okay.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
What do you want to know?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Well, they put a camera up your butt.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
They sedate you before.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yes.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
I was recently in for an endoscopy.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
That's the other way.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
These kids will learn all about this stuff soon enough.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
It becomes de rigueur, I believe the phrase is.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Now they want to check out your tuchas.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
They put a camera up there, a little robe on a little Mars rover.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
They sedate you.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
They want to put you under.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
The anesthesia didn't take.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
It took right away.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
The nurse goes, okay, you should start feeling a little dizzy.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
And I'm like, I really don't feel.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
And then I was gone.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
And then what I'm going to say is probably halfway through the procedure,

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
I start waking up and I open up my eyes.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
And there's a big screen in front of me because I'm laying on my side

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
and the screen is there because on the other side,

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
the doctor's like sticking this up my butt.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
And I get to see what's inside my butt.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
This was the poster for the Truman Show, remember?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Right.

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
And in my brain, my brain goes, you should say something.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
And then I imagine myself saying something like going,

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
I'm still awake.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
And it just sounded like begging to be made fun of.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
That's your concern in that moment.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Yeah.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
As you're living through everyone.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
And then I got...

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Rob, you're a director.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
You could just say cut.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Moving on.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Check the gate.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
I mean, really check the gate.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
But I was going to say something.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I was going to say something.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
But then another voice in my head said,

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
no, wait, I want to see if these guys are going to talk shit about me.

16:17.000 --> 16:24.000
So I kept my eyes closed and I just, I sat there.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
And then actually I told this conversation to my dad who I,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
you know, like the next day because he says,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
how did it go?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I woke up in the middle of it, dad.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Oh.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Oh.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
The cat is in the cradle in the silver spoon.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Little boy.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
And we're on speakerphone in Kate's car because we're driving to Topanga.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
And I woke up in the middle of it, dad.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
And he goes, oh, that must have been weird.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
You know something?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
It wasn't that bad.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I was just silent.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
Just, just, maybe okay.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
It wasn't that bad.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Well, your dad was in the Navy, right?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Too close to home, maybe.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Probably.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Where he met my mom.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
You can tell him I said that.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
He's the fan of yours.

17:11.000 --> 17:18.000
The, I just am amazed at how much different do you think had to do with the chemical reaction in your brain?

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
Like how high do you think you were and how lucid do you think you were making a decision?

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
Like I'm waking up in the middle of the American public's worst medical nightmare,

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
which is failed anesthesia, which happens once at a 10,000 times.

17:34.000 --> 17:41.000
And you're, you're waking up, which, and you make a decision based on like peer pressure.

17:41.000 --> 17:51.000
And like a weird, like you want to know whether or not people make fun of your intestines behind your back.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Yeah.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And you say, yeah.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
I would be curious to know what kind of shit they might talk.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Look at this guy's fucking lower fucking colon.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Oh my God.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Eat Taco Bell much?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
All right.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
Like the twist and turns like, oh, we got a Scotland highway here.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
So someone's going to Glasgow.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Yeah.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I mean, come on.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Come on.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
I mean, if you work at a restaurant and you know, you're a waiter and you come back in the kitchen,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
you go, man, table eight, what a bunch of dickheads.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
And we should spit in his colon.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Yeah.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Hey, wake up.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
It's great.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Oh, thanks.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
You know, I never, I didn't tip him.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I should have done that.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Yeah.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
Rob, do you want to drink from Sarah from the Outback?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I'll have a yes.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Can we get a kettle one on the rocks?

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Thank you, Sarah.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
No, no, we pay her.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
We pay her.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
No, I didn't tip her.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
Now that this gets into the illegal right now, is this money?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Oh, shit.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
I only got 100.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
No, it's a receipt from El Pollo logo.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
And by the way, I mean, like he keeps acting like that shopping thing in salon was like, like no big deal,

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
but he was texting and like, like he was like, I was like, you fucking asshole.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
I hope you're happy.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
And he's like, this is all I ever wanted.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
And then he texted me later and said, Jessica Alba is following me now.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
Because Jessica Alba, I'm meeting Jessica Alba's social media assistant probably is following,

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
was following me.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I noticed at one point, I'm sure it made you very jealous.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
And so you texted me, Jessica Alba is following me now.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And Valerie Burton-Elly.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
And I, and I.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Valerie Burton-Elly.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
You mean Queen of the Trolls?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Yep.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
That's, that's who I took down.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Valerie Burton-Elly, you think you're so cool.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Fuck off.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Take it.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
That's what I'm going to do.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
All right.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
This one guy, this one guy, like right after the podcast was like, like, was Schrabbing me.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
It was like going, oh, what is this?

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
Like three times in a row and failed every single time.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
And then like the fourth one he was, your bits getting old.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
He ran out of gas on you.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Yeah.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Like I went out, I was at work and then I noticed like this train of this guy is like every

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
15 minutes.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
And then on the fourth tweet, your bits getting old.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
I think you got to get some new material, buddy.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Okay.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
After, after four times.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Is the, is the book deal, is it going to be, is what's your book going to be called?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Like what is this book called?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Humble Bragg.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
Just a, just a crown way heavy on the King of the Trolls.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
So heavy.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
A lot of responsibility.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
And my fingers are so aching from.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
I'm so proud of the Camel's not here tonight because he will be.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I think Camel hates me right now.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Camel, yeah.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
I think he absolutely, I've been texting him and writing him like, hey, Guardians of

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Galaxy is one o'clock.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
What do you think?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Nothing.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Usually you would be like, hey, we're going to see Star Trek into darkness.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Come on.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Whatever.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Yeah.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Not anymore.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
He's kind of busy.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Busy.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Not liking me.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Yeah.

21:20.000 --> 21:26.000
Well, I kind of, I'm kind of eager to bring Spencer out because there's a, there's also

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
a new segment I'd like to do with him.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
You think that would be okay to bring him at this early?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
It's never too early to bring Spencer out.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
All right.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Spencer Crittenden, everybody.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
Who's coming?

21:41.000 --> 21:49.000
Spencer, don't, don't mix up those person.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Hey, what?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Don't mix, don't mix up those person.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
I'll fucking kill you, man.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
Don't mix them up.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Two person.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
Are you live-Schrabbing right now?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
What is that?

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
You're just, can I just be topped off with ice, Sarah?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I don't actually need more vodka.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Or maybe a little bit more.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Spencer, have you met Sarah?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
I met it on the way up and the way down.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
You don't really drink though, do you, Spencer?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
No.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Would you like a drink while we have Sarah?

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
No, no.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
I'll go bad.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
I'll just spoil immediately.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
Spencer, I brought you up early because you mentioned something in the greener when I was like,

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
okay, stop, save it for the stage.

22:39.000 --> 22:47.000
To catch us up, you're, you're, stop me if I start to become insensitive about this.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
That's an option?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Did you hear about this?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I haven't been on the show in a while.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
We would have no-

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
Stop him if he becomes insensitive.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
GI Jeff would have been a different story.

23:04.000 --> 23:10.000
Stop me if I talk too much.

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
Since you've joined our family, Spencer, your parents have broken up.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Yeah.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
They were kind of, as we've discussed it in the past, like, you kind of felt like maybe

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
you were the glue that was holding them together.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Yeah, you know, I've long theorized that.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
And then you moved out.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
We've watched Spencer grow up from a, from a young waif, an urchin in the back of the

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Apple Star.

23:33.000 --> 23:41.000
He's now a producer and I think a hanger, a hanger, hanger about in the writer's room

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
and like, well, you're-

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Also an unlicensed bartender.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Yeah, you may, oh yeah, constantly getting me drinks.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Yeah.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
I mean, it's, but, but you moved out of your parents' house and then they immediately went

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
their separate ways.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
It was pretty immediate.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
And the last time we saw your dad, he was bounding up from the audience and he was

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
like, hey, it's me, Spencer's dad.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
Oh yeah, Spencer has testicles.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
So, so the thing is, so now your, your parents have gone their separate ways and this is,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
this is not unfamiliar to me.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
When I was like 10, my parents had a little separation year.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
But you're much older than that and this seems more permanent than theirs.

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
But much like my parents, it kind of like, now you're watching your parents kind of like

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
do their own thing.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Yeah.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
And your dad has gone to Central America?

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's in Columbia right now.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
And, and so I said that to Erin and she was like, is he going to be okay?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
It's like the kidnapping capital of the world.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
Like, sorry if you're a Colombian Harmontown fan.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Also don't get kidnapped.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
It's safer there now.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Okay.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Thank you.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
We got it.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
We got a Colombian update.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
Um, the, but, but you, so your dad, and now you told me in the green room, you said

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
your dad is sending you updates.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Like there's letters.

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
And man, I keep, I keep, he sends these emails and started out just like, Hey Spencer, just

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
wanted to let you know, I got off the plane.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Okay.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
My phone exploded, but then it was fine again.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
Or like, you know, whatever, I stubbed my foot.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Do you stub a foot?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
I don't know.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
But, um, he, he, he would just send me little things, but then it turned into this like

25:28.000 --> 25:34.160
Christmas style newsletter that would just happen and the email, like the list of recipients

25:34.160 --> 25:36.160
got longer and longer.

25:36.160 --> 25:42.840
And there's people that I'm pretty sure are just my little brother's friends that like

25:42.840 --> 25:44.840
received this newsletter.

25:44.840 --> 25:45.840
And it's weird.

25:45.840 --> 25:49.200
Is it, is it just called like, uh, Mike's missives?

25:49.200 --> 25:52.720
They're all, they're all cleverly titled individually.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.800
Like there's no title for the actual thing.

25:54.800 --> 25:58.080
Like he hasn't, no, each of them is like its own beautiful vignette.

25:58.080 --> 26:04.040
If you think about example, he had an email that was like, Oh God, I fell asleep.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.460
I'm getting a haircut.

26:06.460 --> 26:07.960
Never fall asleep in Columbia.

26:07.960 --> 26:11.880
How about never fall asleep getting a fucking haircut?

26:11.880 --> 26:15.520
That's an insane person thing to do.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.160
I fall asleep getting haircuts all the time.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.880
That's crazy.

26:18.880 --> 26:21.040
You have a lot of faith in Europe.

26:21.040 --> 26:26.640
I was going to say your opponent, your bartenders, bartender, your bartender, what do you call

26:26.640 --> 26:27.640
it a barber?

26:27.640 --> 26:28.640
A salonist.

26:28.640 --> 26:29.640
A salonist.

26:29.640 --> 26:30.640
I don't call him a bartender.

26:30.640 --> 26:31.640
I call him a bartender.

26:31.640 --> 26:32.640
Maybe this is my problem.

26:32.640 --> 26:39.600
No, but your barber, you, you don't count, man, your neck's going to be moving all around.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.920
You don't, you don't fall asleep stock still.

26:41.920 --> 26:47.200
Last time the haircut you're currently looking at, I, I was fast asleep during that.

26:47.200 --> 26:50.480
And apparently my neck was not flapping around or maybe it was.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.480
That's why it looks like this.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.840
Maybe you just got an iron neck or something.

26:53.840 --> 26:59.520
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised that that's what the ladies say at that point.

26:59.520 --> 27:06.920
I have a general rule, I, uh, I never travel anywhere where one of the rules is don't fall

27:06.920 --> 27:07.920
asleep.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.160
Well, I don't know if the rule is actually don't fall asleep.

27:11.160 --> 27:16.480
I think the only places that that's applicable in pop culture are the asylum where Freddie

27:16.480 --> 27:19.280
Krueger survivors live.

27:19.280 --> 27:22.040
Is he in like Medellin or Bogota or what's he doing?

27:22.040 --> 27:23.880
I think he's closer to Bogota.

27:23.880 --> 27:24.880
He, he, he was.

27:24.880 --> 27:25.880
Is he on a vision quest?

27:25.880 --> 27:26.880
Is he doing ayahuasca?

27:26.880 --> 27:29.760
I wish that'd be so respectable.

27:29.760 --> 27:32.880
He's, he's trying to, you know, get by.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.320
It's cheaper to live there.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.320
He's teaching English.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.520
Oh, so he's gone there, not just for kicks.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.440
He's gone there to make his way in the world.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.440
Yeah.

27:40.440 --> 27:41.440
Yeah.

27:41.440 --> 27:44.960
He wants to, you know, eventually get, get a job and I'm like, uh, one of those, uh,

27:44.960 --> 27:49.200
TV companies out there stationed out there, you know, he used to work in TV.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.200
That's great.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.200
That's, that's admirable.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.200
It's very cool.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.200
It's certainly interesting.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.200
What's your mom doing?

27:54.200 --> 27:56.200
Uh, you know, burn.

27:56.200 --> 28:07.640
She, she's, I just, this is the perfect, I want to get a T-shirt like a Rob Schrab, like

28:07.640 --> 28:13.800
a Schrabbing T-shirt that says, what is this T-shirt or what T-shirt is this?

28:13.800 --> 28:16.520
And then on the back, it says like, who is Rob Schrab or something.

28:16.520 --> 28:20.440
Remember when Rob used his own technique to promote the found crap thing?

28:20.440 --> 28:22.440
He said, when is this thing I'm promoting?

28:22.440 --> 28:23.920
So the thing, all right.

28:23.920 --> 28:29.440
Anyways, I wanted to, I was going to say you've become Rip Taylor, uh, the, uh, but before

28:29.440 --> 28:35.720
we move on to your mom, yeah, he's panamining confetti, but it's better with confetti.

28:35.720 --> 28:41.120
You can't just, you can't, you can't, before we, before we, before you answer about, about

28:41.120 --> 28:44.920
your mom, I just want to, I want to ask about your dad, uh, are you trying to get off her

28:44.920 --> 28:45.920
mom?

28:45.920 --> 28:46.920
Yeah.

28:46.920 --> 28:47.920
Yes.

28:47.920 --> 28:48.920
I thought of that earlier.

28:48.920 --> 28:52.240
Uh, I didn't get an opportunity to say, do you think your, your dad probably, I would

28:52.240 --> 28:55.120
guess he probably, not to flatter us, but he probably is listening.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.120
Don't you think?

28:56.120 --> 28:57.120
Ah, maybe.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.120
I mean, you never know.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.120
Cause what else is he doing down there?

28:59.120 --> 29:00.120
I really don't want to flatter him.

29:00.120 --> 29:01.120
I really don't want to flatter him.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.120
Yeah.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.120
I mean, well, he's always having adventures.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.120
It's kind of amazing.

29:04.120 --> 29:08.080
Spencer, do you want to fire off, assuming he's listening, which he, you know, he most

29:08.080 --> 29:09.080
certainly is.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.680
Do you want to fire off a missive to him right now?

29:10.680 --> 29:14.720
Uh, I don't know who you're sending all these fucking, or how many people you're sending

29:14.720 --> 29:17.080
these emails to, but it's kind of ridiculous.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.640
So, all right.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.120
That was it?

29:20.120 --> 29:21.120
Yeah.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.360
This is how our communications go.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.840
They're very matter of fact.

29:24.840 --> 29:25.840
All right.

29:25.840 --> 29:26.840
All right.

29:26.840 --> 29:27.840
You, yeah.

29:27.840 --> 29:28.840
Right.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.680
Ring, ring in your, uh, your recipient list.

29:30.680 --> 29:34.480
It's offensive to all the people that you are sending it to, or have to feel like a piece

29:34.480 --> 29:35.480
of shit.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.480
Yeah.

29:36.480 --> 29:39.600
I have to scroll past it all to get to the, you know, I'm on the list for certain like

29:39.600 --> 29:40.600
people.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.600
That's an LA thing.

29:41.600 --> 29:45.840
A big, a lot of times it's like, like an actor will just send out a newsletter that's

29:45.840 --> 29:50.800
like Steve's daily Gazette or monthly, monthly Gazette.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.800
Yeah.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.960
It's like, it's been a weird month for Steve.

29:53.960 --> 29:59.200
I found a lot of solace in the documentary, uh, uh, Chocolate Man.

29:59.200 --> 30:04.040
Uh, it's the story of a thing and he'll just talk about what he's been watching and it's

30:04.040 --> 30:09.560
like, it's addressed to, and I want to say to like Steve, like, you know, have the balls

30:09.560 --> 30:12.040
to tell your grandma you love her.

30:12.040 --> 30:16.200
Don't send her a fucking newspaper because she's the only one who gives a shit about

30:16.200 --> 30:22.000
any of this and you're treating her like a fucking plebe, like just email your grandma

30:22.000 --> 30:23.520
and say, I love you.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.480
Thank you for taking an interest in my shit.

30:25.480 --> 30:26.480
Yeah.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.000
Everyone else is like, Steve's, what?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
What is this?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Yeah.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.760
He had an audition for the shield.

30:31.760 --> 30:32.760
What the fuck has he taught?

30:32.760 --> 30:33.760
What?

30:33.760 --> 30:35.760
That's canceled.

30:35.760 --> 30:39.120
Have you, have you seen, have you seen Chocolate Man?

30:39.120 --> 30:40.120
So true.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.120
Yeah.

30:41.120 --> 30:45.160
I mean, I've seen, I'm assuming you've seen Chocolate Man.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.160
It's riveting.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.160
Yeah.

30:47.160 --> 30:54.160
It's, I mean, the guy can't keep, uh, the sad thing is that he can't keep a pet dog.

30:54.160 --> 31:02.400
Like, he loves dogs, but his livelihood is chocolate and they just keep dying on him.

31:02.400 --> 31:05.640
Wait, wait, why can't Chocolate Man have a dog?

31:05.640 --> 31:10.560
Chocolate is poisonous to dogs, but only really dark chocolate, but Chocolate Man is deals

31:10.560 --> 31:14.840
in dark, dark chocolate and he loves dogs.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.920
And no one will pay him to love dogs.

31:16.920 --> 31:22.600
So it's, it becomes, as the New York Times said, it becomes an unwitting expose of dog

31:22.600 --> 31:30.600
culture, uh, what starts as a, as a, as a chock, chock a, chock a journey, dumb, stupid.

31:30.600 --> 31:34.680
That's not a, that's not a play on words, it's not a play on words.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.120
New York Times is not what it used to be.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.120
Yeah.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.120
No, no, no.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.120
It's just a block now.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.120
Remember that guy that reviewed the podcast?

31:40.120 --> 31:42.120
He's like, uh, Aaron's got a poo cast.

31:42.120 --> 31:45.720
Kumeil Nanja Johnson is doing great.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.720
Jim Davis is funny as always.

31:47.720 --> 31:48.720
All right.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.120
That's the New York Times.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.480
It's really weird.

31:51.480 --> 31:56.800
And Salon will just do an article about Shra, but then clearly they're running on vapors

31:56.800 --> 31:57.800
out there.

31:57.800 --> 31:58.800
Right.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.800
A couple other websites too.

32:00.800 --> 32:01.800
Oh yeah.

32:01.800 --> 32:04.400
This, this is a story, this is a story of legs.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.400
Did it catch fire?

32:05.400 --> 32:06.900
Did it make it to TMZ?

32:06.900 --> 32:07.900
What's that?

32:07.900 --> 32:08.900
I sent it.

32:08.900 --> 32:09.900
I sent you another article.

32:09.900 --> 32:10.900
No.

32:10.900 --> 32:11.900
I texted you.

32:11.900 --> 32:14.160
I said, most of the time when you text me something, I'll click on it and it's just

32:14.160 --> 32:18.480
a dude with two dicks in his mouth.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.480
Only two dicks?

32:19.480 --> 32:20.480
Yeah.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.480
Like.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.480
Schrab's not what he used to be.

32:22.480 --> 32:29.680
I was the three-dick guy back in the day, but so lazy to do the work.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.400
But, but, but so, so I didn't, by the way, I didn't retweet the Salon article.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.720
I'm very, very proud of you, but I kind of, I'm really conflicted about it.

32:35.720 --> 32:40.640
I'm boycott, I boycott Salon because of that weird, I don't know, they did a weird hatchet

32:40.640 --> 32:43.680
job on Patton Oswalt and I don't think that kind of stuff should be rewarded.

32:43.680 --> 32:47.240
It was like that weird, it was just a, I just like, I'm not, I'm not clicking on it.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.680
What was the tweet that he did that got there, Dandruff?

32:49.680 --> 32:50.680
Who knows?

32:50.680 --> 32:51.880
Whatever it was, it was ironic.

32:51.880 --> 32:58.360
You don't, you don't get more progressive and not racist than, than Patton Oswalt.

32:58.360 --> 33:01.440
He doesn't give a fuck about, he's like, he's a, he's a comedian.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.000
He's been, he's been making people laugh for a really long time.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.680
Patton, as far as I know, is one of the most flagrant bigots I've ever seen.

33:08.680 --> 33:13.720
I don't even want to talk about it, I'll get my dander up and then I'll, then my dander

33:13.720 --> 33:14.720
will go up.

33:14.720 --> 33:15.720
Don't do that.

33:15.720 --> 33:16.720
Yeah.

33:16.720 --> 33:17.720
Keep that dander down, man.

33:17.720 --> 33:20.720
I prefer it to be dripping into my, uh, cough, than my, my cup.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.840
Um, I don't know why I'm looking at this anymore, let me see if there's anything else

33:23.840 --> 33:24.840
on here.

33:24.840 --> 33:28.560
Uh, did I ever tell the story about, uh, uh, Suckin' Dick?

33:28.560 --> 33:38.740
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

33:38.740 --> 33:39.740
Davis.

33:39.740 --> 33:41.800
No you did not.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.200
Please continue.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.120
And it's down.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.120
It keeps scrolling.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.120
I do not have that honor.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.120
Chaplin does.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.120
I wrote it.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.120
The night is young.

33:50.120 --> 33:57.360
Uh, my, uh, uh, one time, uh, did I ever tell this story that one time a friend of mine

33:57.360 --> 33:59.800
that it's kind of like a super hacker.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.720
He let me know that my iCloud account had been hacked.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.880
And that's why now I use this one password thing,

34:05.880 --> 34:09.160
like this app, because I was using really easy passwords.

34:09.160 --> 34:13.040
And he let me know, yeah, we're tracking this guy.

34:13.040 --> 34:17.440
He set up a thing, he hacks people's cell phones

34:17.440 --> 34:20.960
and high-profile people, and they traced back

34:20.960 --> 34:23.080
this whole operation that this guy had set up

34:23.080 --> 34:25.480
and it started with Cameron Diaz's cell phone.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.320
Thank you.

34:26.320 --> 34:29.240
Two cell phones away from Cameron Diaz.

34:29.240 --> 34:32.280
That's, I'm not in her cell phone,

34:32.280 --> 34:34.840
but someone who is in Cameron Diaz's cell phone

34:34.840 --> 34:37.840
has my number, probably Ben Stiller, from 18 years ago.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.040
All right, not a good story.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.360
Sorry about that.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.200
I thought it was interesting, put it in my Evernote.

34:43.200 --> 34:44.040
That was the whole story?

34:44.040 --> 34:45.400
Yes, yes, yes.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.360
I want to know about the dick sucking.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.200
Yeah.

34:49.200 --> 34:50.720
Yeah, why'd you drop that?

34:51.840 --> 34:54.640
Do you want to have that on her?

34:54.640 --> 34:55.960
Do you want to be on her?

34:55.960 --> 34:57.920
Rob, would you honor Dan?

34:58.840 --> 35:00.240
I would love to.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.080
I would love to.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.080
I would love to.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.080
I would love to.

35:03.080 --> 35:04.080
I would love to.

35:04.080 --> 35:05.400
What does that mean?

35:05.400 --> 35:07.040
I've been a podcast where two straight guys

35:07.040 --> 35:08.880
just started sucking dick.

35:08.880 --> 35:12.080
I think they wouldn't be straight guys if that happened.

35:12.080 --> 35:13.680
That's not, well, I don't guess it is.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.240
Yeah, well, okay.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.920
Two straight guys could suck a dick.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.040
Especially, you know.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.360
If one's when you're kind of.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.680
Sucking dick for an audience.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.520
For a cause.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.840
Yeah, for a cause.

35:23.840 --> 35:26.680
If you do it to raise awareness of something.

35:26.680 --> 35:29.040
Unless it's to raise awareness of sucking dick.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.160
Then it's.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.840
Raise awareness of how much you like a dick in your mouth.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.760
Then that's just, that's not charity.

35:36.760 --> 35:41.760
But the, hello to all our homosexual listeners.

35:41.800 --> 35:42.640
How are you?

35:42.640 --> 35:44.160
We believe you're human.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.560
We value your listenership.

35:46.840 --> 35:47.680
Sorry.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.480
I think that was implicit until you said that weird

35:49.480 --> 35:50.320
disclaimer.

35:50.320 --> 35:53.800
That was a weird apology.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.680
Also the word homosexual is now,

35:56.680 --> 35:58.960
it's the new like Afro-American.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.880
It sounds kind of weird on the tongue, doesn't it now?

36:00.880 --> 36:02.440
Homosexual. Weird on the tongue.

36:04.320 --> 36:07.440
You know what else feels kind of weird in the tongue?

36:07.440 --> 36:08.280
Rob dick.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.160
What do you say now instead of homosexual?

36:12.160 --> 36:13.000
Gay?

36:13.000 --> 36:14.520
I think, yeah, well, I don't know.

36:14.520 --> 36:15.360
It's weird.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.720
I mean, it's not that it's a bad word.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.640
It doesn't sound kind of clunky now.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.000
It's kind of, he's saying it's kind of a mouthful.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.520
I don't know why I keep looking at my phone.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.800
I don't have anything on here anymore.

36:34.800 --> 36:35.640
I'm just like.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.040
Because there's pictures of dicks on it.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.040
I don't like fundraising at the office,

36:41.040 --> 36:42.240
unless it's for charity.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.320
What in the sec way is going on?

36:47.320 --> 36:48.760
That was the last thing on my phone.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.160
So like book drives?

36:50.160 --> 36:54.320
Listen to me, like, I'm not opposed to it.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.680
I'm not telling you to stop doing it.

36:55.680 --> 36:56.760
Here's what I'm saying.

36:56.760 --> 36:57.880
I think it's weird.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.800
I think we have accepted something as normal

36:59.800 --> 37:00.840
that's very weird.

37:00.840 --> 37:04.160
I think that we all work at offices and office environments

37:04.160 --> 37:05.800
and we're all pretty familiar with the fact

37:05.800 --> 37:08.480
that every once in a while someone comes to the office

37:08.480 --> 37:11.040
and they'll just kind of announce

37:11.040 --> 37:13.680
that their niece, Katie, is going to Scotland

37:13.680 --> 37:16.840
to play soccer or learn to play the trumpet or something.

37:16.840 --> 37:19.320
Nothing to do with any disease or anything.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.560
It's just like, just some kid is going to do something

37:22.560 --> 37:24.720
and then everyone at the office is kind of like

37:24.720 --> 37:28.160
subtly pressured to like buy a Kit Kat or something.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.480
I just think it's really weird

37:29.480 --> 37:31.560
that we accept this as common behavior.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.800
I'm assuming your office meeting Starburns?

37:33.800 --> 37:35.160
Well, I'm not complaining about anyone

37:35.160 --> 37:36.840
that works for me right now.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.080
I'm just saying it's-

37:38.080 --> 37:38.920
People come in and say,

37:38.920 --> 37:41.640
hey, my daughter's going on a trip and everybody pony up.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.400
By applause, how many people have been in an office

37:43.400 --> 37:44.240
where this has happened?

37:44.240 --> 37:47.440
Smattering.

37:47.440 --> 37:51.160
That's a well, well, easily 1,100 people.

37:51.160 --> 37:52.680
Yeah.

37:52.680 --> 37:55.040
It happens outside of the grocery store too.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.880
You never know, you ever notice this?

37:56.880 --> 37:58.600
You ever see one of these?

37:58.600 --> 38:01.800
You're going into the grocery store?

38:01.800 --> 38:02.640
You're trying to make-

38:02.640 --> 38:03.920
Rob, are you about to break into one of your

38:03.920 --> 38:05.600
patented universal comedy bits?

38:05.600 --> 38:06.440
Yeah.

38:06.440 --> 38:09.000
Yeah, you walk it in and you see him

38:09.000 --> 38:10.360
and then what do you do?

38:10.360 --> 38:11.360
You pull out your phone.

38:11.360 --> 38:14.520
Who I'm checking a text in you?

38:14.520 --> 38:16.360
Right by, man.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.840
No, I will not have a chocolate bar.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.720
No, I do not want that.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.520
I'm looking at my phone.

38:23.520 --> 38:26.080
I walk too fast.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.600
I told you the story about the guy that came to my door,

38:28.600 --> 38:31.280
at my house, and he had a baseball cap on it.

38:31.280 --> 38:34.040
He had kind of a Kevin James sort of build.

38:34.040 --> 38:34.720
And-

38:34.720 --> 38:37.760
So, very fit and lean.

38:37.760 --> 38:41.320
And he rang my doorbell and I came out and-

38:41.320 --> 38:44.720
And I said, of course I'm in the middle of something.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.440
No one is ever sitting in a glass chamber

38:46.440 --> 38:49.160
waiting to interact with a stranger at their door.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.480
So, that's another thing.

38:50.480 --> 38:55.480
If your hobby or vocation involves costing strangers,

38:55.680 --> 38:58.320
try to remember you're in the middle of their lives,

38:58.320 --> 38:59.760
not the other way around.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.440
All right, well, sorry.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.840
Sorry, we're new at this.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.600
Sarah went to get Jeff a drink and I let it derail the show.

39:07.600 --> 39:08.960
Are you okay with this?

39:08.960 --> 39:10.200
I'm so sorry.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.920
She's making a hundred dollars.

39:11.920 --> 39:12.760
We're in the-

39:12.760 --> 39:13.600
She's already made it.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.800
She can walk out the door right now.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.480
She could just disappear into the night

39:17.480 --> 39:18.960
and she would have a hundred dollars too.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.560
We saw a crocodile dundee too.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.440
Not only can she leave, she can go somewhere

39:22.440 --> 39:24.440
that even cartels can't get her.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.960
She could put like bats in bags

39:28.960 --> 39:30.280
and throw them on our campfire.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.120
And we'd be like, ah, I carumba!

39:33.760 --> 39:34.640
Did that happen?

39:34.640 --> 39:37.400
Yeah, Sarah, you've already made your money, Sarah.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.040
If at any point you want to just disappear,

39:39.040 --> 39:39.880
you're allowed to.

39:39.880 --> 39:42.400
You're not beholden to stay up here on stage.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.880
Although, we would love you to stay.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.520
I think her date applauded that.

39:47.360 --> 39:48.840
No, I think she was beholden.

39:48.840 --> 39:49.680
We gave her a hundred bucks.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.440
She's gonna give us 50 if she leaves.

39:53.680 --> 39:54.880
All right.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.640
What kind of crazy-

39:56.640 --> 39:59.400
I'm just saying, it's not indentured servitude.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.640
Oh, I mean, if you wanted it that way,

40:01.640 --> 40:03.160
we'd say we'll give you a hundred dollars

40:03.160 --> 40:04.440
at the end of the show.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.520
I'm gonna give you $20 to please sit down

40:06.520 --> 40:09.960
because you're making me feel bad.

40:09.960 --> 40:12.680
He's paying you $20 to devalue my hundred.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.600
What kind of crazy-

40:17.600 --> 40:18.920
I put 17.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.880
You paid 83, whatever.

40:20.880 --> 40:21.720
Right.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.040
All right, Sarah, I mean, you're free to go.

40:24.040 --> 40:25.480
I'm not gonna be Sauron.

40:27.920 --> 40:28.760
I think stay.

40:30.480 --> 40:31.320
Do what you want.

40:31.320 --> 40:32.880
Yes, keep it, keep it, keep it.

40:32.880 --> 40:36.560
Also, keep my guilt money.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.080
The reason why I feel bad is

40:38.080 --> 40:39.200
because we have a woman on stage

40:39.200 --> 40:41.200
and she's not talking at all.

40:41.200 --> 40:44.080
As always, there's a bunch of dudes sounding off

40:44.080 --> 40:46.000
and that we have a gal on stage.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.680
Give her a microphone, Dan.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.040
This microphone costs $15.

40:52.040 --> 40:52.880
Yes.

40:52.880 --> 41:01.840
What's like a good Aussie like bar drinking, bar song?

41:01.840 --> 41:04.560
How about the person I asked?

41:04.560 --> 41:09.200
Is there like an Aussie toast, like a famous cheerer,

41:09.200 --> 41:12.000
like a poem or a rhyme or anything like that?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.680
It would be Aussie, Aussie, Aussie,

41:13.680 --> 41:16.960
and then everyone goes oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, yeah.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.800
Didn't they do that on the man show

41:18.800 --> 41:20.240
when Kimmel was on there?

41:20.240 --> 41:21.600
Did they do some kind of thing like that?

41:21.600 --> 41:23.600
Yeah, we got it in Mexico, people knew it.

41:23.600 --> 41:24.560
Is that right?

41:24.560 --> 41:25.280
Yeah.

41:25.280 --> 41:26.480
I love that.

41:26.480 --> 41:27.040
It's nice.

41:27.040 --> 41:28.480
What part of Australia are you from?

41:28.480 --> 41:29.360
Melbourne.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.080
Melbourne.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.600
I went there once, it was quite lovely.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.600
It's very funny people, very nice.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.680
Is it true about the toilets?

41:38.720 --> 41:40.640
Is that an urban legend or is that true?

41:40.640 --> 41:41.840
That they're full of poo?

41:42.640 --> 41:45.280
No, that they swirl in opposite directions.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.480
Yeah, the southern hemisphere.

41:46.480 --> 41:49.360
How long did that take before somebody figured it out?

41:49.360 --> 41:53.040
You know, because they're living on the other side of the world,

41:53.040 --> 41:58.560
and then, I mean, somebody would have had to have gone to the bathroom,

41:58.560 --> 42:02.720
stared at the toilet, went, ooh, counterclockwise,

42:02.720 --> 42:05.680
and then jumped on the plane, flew to America,

42:05.680 --> 42:07.040
and then immediately did it.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.720
Dan, are you pouring yourself a drink right now?

42:08.720 --> 42:11.280
Yeah, you guys freed our indentured servant.

42:11.280 --> 42:14.160
No, she stayed up here, she had a job to do.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.520
Put that ice back in the bucket.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.640
Here, I'll take the ice.

42:18.640 --> 42:19.920
I'll take the ice.

42:19.920 --> 42:20.480
I'll take the ice.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.520
No, let her do it.

42:21.520 --> 42:22.400
We fucking paid her.

42:23.120 --> 42:23.280
I'll take the ice.

42:23.280 --> 42:24.400
I'm so fucking confused.

42:24.400 --> 42:28.160
This is exactly what was happening in America in 1848.

42:30.480 --> 42:33.120
Like, there was a lot of like, we...

42:33.120 --> 42:34.720
Can you pass it down, pass it down?

42:34.720 --> 42:38.480
Look, it's to our discomfort

42:38.480 --> 42:40.000
that it happened to be a woman that came over.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.840
I said, guy, you wouldn't be bothered by this at all.

42:41.840 --> 42:42.240
No.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.680
I wasn't bothered with it.

42:43.680 --> 42:46.960
I love throwing money at people and just like,

42:46.960 --> 42:49.840
that's what I do with Spencer.

42:49.840 --> 42:50.800
Easy, easy, easy.

42:50.800 --> 42:51.600
Everybody wins.

42:51.600 --> 42:51.840
Yeah, okay.

42:51.840 --> 42:53.840
You're better than my stand to show up full paint spray.

42:53.840 --> 42:54.960
Adam, sit the fuck down.

42:55.840 --> 42:56.560
Adam?

42:56.560 --> 42:58.000
Adam, sit down.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.160
I'll pay you $20 to shut the fuck up.

43:01.360 --> 43:02.640
No, I don't have any more money.

43:02.640 --> 43:03.040
Get away.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.200
Get away from me.

43:05.200 --> 43:06.560
I just, I like a lot of ice.

43:06.560 --> 43:08.160
When the home audience doesn't know right now,

43:08.160 --> 43:08.960
the listener doesn't know.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.360
Adam is hiding behind a beam right now.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.280
And he's holding a vial.

43:15.280 --> 43:16.640
I said, water bottle.

43:16.640 --> 43:17.360
Yeah.

43:17.360 --> 43:17.840
Yeah, right.

43:17.840 --> 43:19.840
He's wrapped around a pillar like a snake.

43:19.840 --> 43:22.000
Like the water bottle in the end of 12 monkeys.

43:22.880 --> 43:24.000
Am I mistaken, Adam?

43:24.000 --> 43:25.920
Or I don't want to bring you up on stage.

43:25.920 --> 43:26.480
I really don't.

43:27.280 --> 43:28.960
And Adam, I say this with all due respect.

43:28.960 --> 43:29.440
I love you.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.400
I respect you.

43:30.400 --> 43:33.040
No, not as due, but all is offered.

43:34.800 --> 43:35.840
I do like you, Adam.

43:35.840 --> 43:39.120
But when Abed on the last show was up here,

43:39.120 --> 43:41.680
were you losing your mind because you got out Asperger'd?

43:42.560 --> 43:42.800
Yes.

43:42.800 --> 43:48.400
Because you were firing off like quips and fucking non sequiturs.

43:48.400 --> 43:52.480
Like, you couldn't believe there was a guy on stage

43:52.480 --> 43:53.840
that was weirder than you.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.400
Evil knows evil.

43:58.160 --> 43:59.120
You're out of a job.

44:00.320 --> 44:00.880
Yeah.

44:00.880 --> 44:03.360
But why are you standing until well lit?

44:05.920 --> 44:07.600
Now you're kneeling in the Iowa.

44:07.600 --> 44:08.160
Are you going to murder us?

44:08.160 --> 44:09.200
Someone took your chair.

44:10.560 --> 44:11.280
What are you doing?

44:11.280 --> 44:12.880
Quick, run, everybody.

44:15.520 --> 44:16.800
The entire audience.

44:17.680 --> 44:18.240
Run away.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.600
We'll meet back in 20 minutes.

44:21.600 --> 44:26.240
Adam, you're the only person that's standing poised to charge the stage.

44:26.240 --> 44:27.600
I just want to say, if you give her the mic stand,

44:27.600 --> 44:29.600
she'll have both her hands free to four drinks.

44:30.240 --> 44:32.400
That's all I wanted to add, so you can get more drinks.

44:33.040 --> 44:33.840
There we go.

44:33.840 --> 44:35.760
I mean, but I'm not giving up my mic stand.

44:36.880 --> 44:37.680
Thank you, Adam.

44:37.680 --> 44:39.680
You were trying to liberate her genius.

44:39.680 --> 44:40.240
Yes.

44:40.240 --> 44:40.800
Fantastic.

44:40.800 --> 44:41.920
Thank you, brother.

44:41.920 --> 44:42.880
Adam Goldberg, everyone.

44:45.360 --> 44:46.320
I'm not clapping.

44:46.960 --> 44:47.920
No, I'm not clapping either.

44:47.920 --> 44:48.880
And I have a mic stand.

44:48.880 --> 44:49.760
I could clap all day.

44:52.640 --> 44:55.120
That's why my lack of clap means something.

44:56.880 --> 44:57.760
Sorry about Adam.

44:57.760 --> 44:58.800
Have you ever listened to the show?

44:58.800 --> 44:59.680
Do you know what's happening?

45:01.040 --> 45:02.240
Yes, I have listened to it before.

45:02.240 --> 45:02.560
Okay.

45:03.520 --> 45:07.040
I don't know if maybe there was a wayward poaching expedition.

45:07.040 --> 45:09.600
You got drank darted and stuck in a crate.

45:09.600 --> 45:12.800
And now you're here and you're like, wow.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.560
Do kangaroos really box?

45:17.680 --> 45:18.480
Is that a thing?

45:19.200 --> 45:20.960
Yeah, there's some really tall kangaroos.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.520
And when they get up on their hind legs, they're like six foot tall.

45:23.520 --> 45:26.240
And if you make them angry, they will punch you in the face.

45:27.280 --> 45:28.000
With their front paw.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.200
With their boxing gloves.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.800
That's like a natural thing they'll do?

45:30.800 --> 45:32.880
Yeah, because they get up like this,

45:32.880 --> 45:34.960
and they're like really, really high, and you can't give them.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.240
Then they're like, wow.

45:36.240 --> 45:40.400
And people mistake them for like giant mice.

45:40.400 --> 45:41.920
Yeah, well, I mean.

45:42.800 --> 45:45.680
No, no, only, only.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.440
Holy cow, look at that giant mouse.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.520
It's as big as a kangaroo.

45:49.520 --> 45:52.080
I think only, I think only.

45:52.080 --> 45:52.800
Giant mouse.

45:52.800 --> 45:58.080
Only Sylvester the cat from the cartoons thought I was a giant.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.600
All right, this is why I dance.

45:59.600 --> 46:00.320
Oh, oh, father.

46:00.960 --> 46:03.040
But here's a fun thing to ask our foreign guests.

46:03.040 --> 46:11.040
Popculturally, what is something that is on TV in Australia that's very,

46:11.040 --> 46:14.160
like kind of home-brewed Australian entertainment,

46:14.160 --> 46:18.000
pop culture, that every Australian kind of knows,

46:18.000 --> 46:21.040
but that once you leave those waters,

46:21.040 --> 46:23.040
like you find that it just drops off entirely.

46:23.040 --> 46:25.360
Like it's just like this Australian thing.

46:25.360 --> 46:27.760
Is this you trying to find out if they watch community in Australia?

46:27.760 --> 46:28.640
No, no, no, no.

46:28.640 --> 46:31.920
That's a transnational export from Conglomerate.

46:31.920 --> 46:35.920
I'm saying like, I was like, somebody from Montreal will go like,

46:35.920 --> 46:37.360
lickity dick, toodle dick.

46:37.360 --> 46:38.640
And you're like, what are you talking about?

46:39.680 --> 46:41.360
And they're like, you know, the little dicks.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.280
And you're like, what the fuck are the little dicks?

46:44.000 --> 46:45.680
It's a, it's a, you know, and it's like,

46:45.680 --> 46:49.040
I always find this really amazing to hear about these things.

46:49.040 --> 46:50.160
Like, is there something like that?

46:51.120 --> 46:53.280
Yes, there's TV shows like Kath and Kim.

46:53.280 --> 46:54.320
Kath and Kim.

46:54.320 --> 46:54.640
Oh, I know that.

46:54.640 --> 46:57.600
Which they did in American Vision, which didn't translate.

46:57.600 --> 46:58.800
There's a movie called The Castle.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.640
Um, yep.

47:00.640 --> 47:03.120
So that's like, everyone in Australia can quote that movie.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.320
Like, from the start.

47:04.320 --> 47:05.760
What's the movie The Castle about?

47:05.760 --> 47:09.360
Um, it's about this family's small suburban town.

47:11.920 --> 47:14.800
Why do you hold your mic to your face to make that distracting sound?

47:16.960 --> 47:18.400
It's about a small suburban.

47:18.400 --> 47:19.280
So it's, yeah.

47:19.280 --> 47:19.680
So it's just like a-

47:19.680 --> 47:21.280
What is the movie Castle about?

47:23.680 --> 47:24.480
But the fuck your head?

47:24.480 --> 47:25.520
It's not about a castle.

47:26.080 --> 47:26.560
It's not.

47:26.560 --> 47:27.040
Okay.

47:27.040 --> 47:27.760
Okay, go ahead.

47:27.760 --> 47:28.480
It's just-

47:28.480 --> 47:29.600
Okay, what is it about?

47:29.600 --> 47:30.400
It's just like a typical-

47:32.000 --> 47:32.720
Where do they live?

47:34.400 --> 47:35.600
They don't live in a castle.

47:35.600 --> 47:36.160
Uh-huh, okay.

47:36.160 --> 47:36.800
It's a metaphor.

47:36.800 --> 47:36.800
Yeah.

47:38.160 --> 47:38.880
It's a metaphor.

47:38.880 --> 47:40.080
Are you fucking eight-year-old?

47:41.840 --> 47:44.640
And also, there's a movie called The Castle in the States,

47:44.640 --> 47:45.680
and it's not-

47:45.680 --> 47:47.360
James Gandolfini in a prison.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.320
Like, it's not-

47:48.320 --> 47:49.600
It's against Robert Redford.

47:49.600 --> 47:49.920
All right.

47:49.920 --> 47:51.280
Stop yelling at me.

47:52.880 --> 47:54.000
You should have-

47:54.000 --> 47:56.160
Next time you wake up and there's a camera up your ass,

47:56.160 --> 48:00.560
just say, excuse me, excuse me, madam.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.280
I happen to be conscious.

48:03.280 --> 48:06.720
Could you please give me more, whatever you put in the-

48:06.720 --> 48:08.400
If I woke up in the middle of a procedure

48:08.400 --> 48:10.960
where they told me beforehand I was supposed to be asleep,

48:10.960 --> 48:13.440
I would fucking start making a lot of noise.

48:13.440 --> 48:16.080
Listen to Rob, Rob, Rob thinks you have to have a monocle

48:16.080 --> 48:17.920
in a top hat and be British.

48:17.920 --> 48:20.000
That's such a fancy thing to say.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.360
You're ass-raping me.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.600
That's so fancy.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.600
I would just say you-

48:25.600 --> 48:27.040
I wouldn't want to be pretentious.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.800
That would have been probably-

48:28.800 --> 48:31.920
I paid a lot of money to be asleep for the next 12 hours

48:31.920 --> 48:34.000
and I'm awake during the thing.

48:34.000 --> 48:38.000
I would feel like it's just a good idea to say,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.400
I'm awake and put me back to sleep or stop-

48:40.400 --> 48:42.880
I should have just started screaming as loud as I could.

48:43.840 --> 48:44.720
That would have-

48:44.720 --> 48:45.360
Then they wouldn't-

48:45.360 --> 48:47.840
They would have been, oh, shit, fucking get him,

48:47.840 --> 48:52.240
fill him up, dump the shit on him, make him go to sleep.

48:52.240 --> 48:53.440
All right, what's the castle about?

48:53.440 --> 48:54.880
It's about a small family.

48:55.600 --> 48:56.640
They live in a little-

48:56.640 --> 48:59.360
Mark Castle can't make it through college.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.760
Until he met a friend.

49:04.480 --> 49:06.880
Dress up like two women.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.160
Mate, I got the perfect apartment.

49:12.320 --> 49:13.440
But there's a catch.

49:14.080 --> 49:15.840
We got to dress up as koalas.

49:15.840 --> 49:23.200
Now, wipe out-

49:23.200 --> 49:23.520
What?

49:25.760 --> 49:26.560
That's going to be great.

49:26.560 --> 49:27.520
This is going to be great.

49:27.520 --> 49:29.040
Please, no, no, this is going to be great.

49:29.040 --> 49:30.160
What's castle about?

49:32.000 --> 49:32.800
Please continue.

49:32.800 --> 49:33.840
What's it about?

49:33.840 --> 49:34.960
It sounds like a great show.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.920
Okay, so it's just about a family,

49:37.920 --> 49:40.960
like a nuclear family living in like a normal suburban town

49:40.960 --> 49:43.600
and they love their house, like the everything set castle.

49:43.600 --> 49:45.200
Then a-

49:45.200 --> 49:45.760
Really?

49:45.760 --> 49:46.720
Yes.

49:48.160 --> 49:52.480
And then a big airport company.

49:52.480 --> 49:53.520
I don't know the word.

49:54.160 --> 49:54.640
Qantas.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.240
Qantas, they get Qantas.

49:57.200 --> 49:57.920
Come along and say,

49:57.920 --> 49:59.840
basically we need to knock down your house

49:59.840 --> 50:01.200
because we need to build a runway

50:01.200 --> 50:02.240
and you have no choice in the matter.

50:02.240 --> 50:03.600
What's the name of the airport?

50:04.160 --> 50:05.120
Castle Airlines.

50:06.160 --> 50:06.800
Drawbridge?

50:06.800 --> 50:07.680
I don't think-

50:07.680 --> 50:14.960
What do you guys- there's aren't jokes.

50:14.960 --> 50:16.000
That's what I'm doing?

50:16.000 --> 50:17.360
I'm redefining the word.

50:17.360 --> 50:19.840
And does the father in the house make a stand

50:19.840 --> 50:20.160
and go like,

50:20.160 --> 50:21.440
you're not taking my fucking house?

50:21.440 --> 50:22.400
That's awesome, see?

50:23.120 --> 50:24.240
It's a good show and you're missing.

50:24.240 --> 50:24.960
All right, great.

50:24.960 --> 50:25.440
Next show.

50:26.720 --> 50:28.640
Okay, what's Squiggle Puss about?

50:29.200 --> 50:30.320
No, made up a show.

50:30.320 --> 50:30.880
Made up a show.

50:31.600 --> 50:32.960
I want to know about Lickl Dicks.

50:33.520 --> 50:34.400
What's a-

50:34.400 --> 50:37.760
Dan, did you see the pilot of Lickl Dicks?

50:37.760 --> 50:38.400
There was a thing.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.960
I dated a Canadian a long time ago

50:40.960 --> 50:41.760
and she in the middle-

50:41.760 --> 50:42.480
So I was like, it was like,

50:42.480 --> 50:43.840
clickety-click barba trick.

50:43.840 --> 50:45.040
It was like the barbapapas,

50:45.040 --> 50:46.160
that's what it was called,

50:46.160 --> 50:47.120
for our Canadian listeners.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.480
Barbapapapas?

50:48.480 --> 50:49.840
Canadian listeners will know what I'm talking about.

50:49.840 --> 50:51.440
There's a cartoon called The Barbapapapas.

50:51.440 --> 50:52.640
But you know, like, I owe-

50:52.640 --> 50:53.200
She would like-

50:53.200 --> 50:54.560
You would reference Scooby-Doo

50:54.560 --> 50:55.120
and she'd be like,

50:55.120 --> 50:55.680
what's that?

50:55.680 --> 50:57.280
And then you could just make up anything

50:57.280 --> 50:58.800
about Scooby-Doo you wanted.

50:58.800 --> 50:59.280
They'd be like,

50:59.280 --> 51:00.800
yeah, well Scooby-Doo is this dog

51:00.800 --> 51:02.080
and he was a ghost.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.920
So he haunted them?

51:03.920 --> 51:05.680
Yeah, the dog haunted them

51:05.680 --> 51:07.440
and told them to solve crimes

51:07.440 --> 51:08.240
or else he'd kill them.

51:08.240 --> 51:10.960
Like, because you just find out

51:10.960 --> 51:11.760
she doesn't have,

51:11.760 --> 51:13.520
but then she would go like,

51:13.520 --> 51:15.200
oh, it's like a barbapapa.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.120
That's a real thing, barbapapa.

51:17.120 --> 51:18.080
They were like these blobs

51:18.080 --> 51:19.360
that would turn into bulldozers.

51:19.360 --> 51:19.600
All right.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.760
Oh, I've seen that.

51:24.640 --> 51:25.520
I love when you go through

51:25.520 --> 51:26.640
like a Canadian airport

51:26.640 --> 51:28.320
and you just look at the corner of the-

51:28.320 --> 51:29.360
There's a TV in the corner.

51:29.360 --> 51:30.640
There's like a purple dog

51:30.640 --> 51:32.880
with a unicorn horn going like,

51:32.880 --> 51:34.720
and that solves that.

51:36.160 --> 51:36.640
And you're like,

51:36.640 --> 51:38.000
this isn't foreign language.

51:38.000 --> 51:38.800
So like what?

51:38.800 --> 51:40.320
It's amazing that I've never seen this.

51:40.320 --> 51:40.720
It's just like,

51:40.720 --> 51:42.080
it's done with all the polish

51:42.080 --> 51:43.920
and they have their own little

51:43.920 --> 51:45.200
Gilligan's Island up there.

51:46.240 --> 51:46.640
They're just,

51:46.640 --> 51:48.000
they're making radios on a coconut

51:48.000 --> 51:49.520
and cartoons about purple ducks.

51:51.120 --> 51:53.680
Is there a radio station in Australia?

51:58.240 --> 51:59.920
I'm almost certain there's several.

51:59.920 --> 52:00.960
Okay, like-

52:00.960 --> 52:02.720
WNG, The Boomerang.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.480
Coming back with the hits from the-

52:04.480 --> 52:05.120
That's what I mean.

52:06.160 --> 52:06.800
That's what I mean.

52:06.800 --> 52:07.920
Do you know what I'm talking about?

52:09.440 --> 52:10.720
Put your hits on the barbie.

52:12.080 --> 52:13.040
Here's Bill Collins.

52:13.040 --> 52:13.760
What is,

52:13.760 --> 52:15.920
what is Slick Rick and Batman

52:15.920 --> 52:16.800
talk about in the morning?

52:16.800 --> 52:18.080
It's like a morning zoo team.

52:18.080 --> 52:19.920
Yeah, what is their catchphrase?

52:19.920 --> 52:22.080
Slick Rick and Batman.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.480
Slick Rick and a Batman.

52:24.480 --> 52:25.120
Coming at you.

52:25.920 --> 52:28.000
Wait, we're better than two cups of coffee.

52:28.000 --> 52:28.560
Come on.

52:28.560 --> 52:29.920
Rob, you be Batman.

52:29.920 --> 52:31.040
Dan, you be Slick Rick.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.160
I want to-

52:32.160 --> 52:33.600
G'day, g'day, g'day, g'day, g'day!

52:37.600 --> 52:39.280
Whoa, O.J. Simpson.

52:39.840 --> 52:41.680
Not getting any breaks this morning.

52:41.680 --> 52:43.440
Ed, don't know what's going on with that.

52:45.120 --> 52:45.600
Point.

52:47.360 --> 52:48.720
If you're driving to Sydney today,

52:48.720 --> 52:50.240
stay off the three.

52:53.600 --> 52:55.600
What's the three all about?

52:55.600 --> 52:56.720
Oh, Reggie.

52:56.720 --> 52:58.560
We'll be back with Reggie later.

52:58.560 --> 53:01.600
But first, here's an update about the-

53:02.800 --> 53:03.920
The pinch at the pump.

53:12.640 --> 53:14.000
So answer the question.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.040
Sorry, sorry.

53:15.040 --> 53:18.480
So Slick Rick is not the rapper Slick Rick from the 80s.

53:19.040 --> 53:19.600
He's just-

53:19.600 --> 53:20.800
No, they don't know about that thing.

53:20.800 --> 53:21.840
No, no, no, no, no.

53:21.840 --> 53:23.680
It's spelled with without the C.

53:24.240 --> 53:24.880
All right.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.880
So is there like a radio team?

53:28.720 --> 53:28.960
Yes.

53:30.560 --> 53:31.040
Knew it.

53:32.400 --> 53:33.600
Is it two guys?

53:36.000 --> 53:36.480
It depends.

53:36.480 --> 53:37.840
There's different type of radio stations

53:37.840 --> 53:38.240
that-

53:38.240 --> 53:39.520
And there's different demographics.

53:39.520 --> 53:40.000
Example.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.200
So, I don't know.

53:41.200 --> 53:42.160
It's hard to say.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.600
But yeah, generally two guys.

53:43.600 --> 53:44.320
It's pretty common.

53:45.040 --> 53:45.600
Yep.

53:45.600 --> 53:47.760
You don't know any names offhand like, like,

53:48.800 --> 53:49.520
tube sock and-

53:49.520 --> 53:55.280
Like, monkey whistler, monkey foot.

53:55.280 --> 53:57.200
No, they don't have like DJ or radio names.

53:57.200 --> 53:58.480
It's just like Matt and Joe.

53:59.120 --> 53:59.840
Joe and Matt.

53:59.840 --> 54:00.880
Yeah, we're more advanced.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.600
We're so much more advanced.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.600
Sarah, what is the antipodean

54:05.600 --> 54:07.360
fascination with giving everybody a nickname?

54:07.360 --> 54:08.880
So if your name is Jeff, you're Jeff-o.

54:10.800 --> 54:11.920
Sarah, you have a nickname, right?

54:11.920 --> 54:12.640
What do they call you?

54:14.640 --> 54:15.280
Bertie.

54:15.280 --> 54:15.840
Bertie?

54:15.840 --> 54:16.320
Bertie.

54:16.320 --> 54:17.200
I thought they were Bertie.

54:17.920 --> 54:18.400
Bertie.

54:18.400 --> 54:19.920
My last name's Bert, so Bertie.

54:19.920 --> 54:20.400
Bertie.

54:20.400 --> 54:23.200
Yeah, everybody has to have a diminutive nickname, right?

54:23.840 --> 54:24.320
Yeah, that's-

54:24.320 --> 54:24.960
That's like Steve.

54:24.960 --> 54:25.360
Yeah, I don't-

54:25.360 --> 54:26.640
Yeah, I don't know why they do that.

54:26.640 --> 54:27.760
I think it's just more casual

54:27.760 --> 54:29.520
and we'd just like to be casual, so.

54:29.520 --> 54:30.400
Oh, fuck, wait a minute.

54:30.400 --> 54:31.760
Wasn't there a zoo team in-

54:31.760 --> 54:33.120
Was it Australian?

54:33.120 --> 54:34.240
Those guys that called-

54:34.240 --> 54:35.920
There was like a scandal where they called

54:35.920 --> 54:38.400
and pretended to be a friend of the-

54:38.400 --> 54:38.880
And they-

54:38.880 --> 54:39.280
There was-

54:39.280 --> 54:40.640
It was a horrible thing that happened.

54:40.640 --> 54:41.440
Like, they did a little-

54:41.440 --> 54:43.360
They did a prank about the-

54:43.360 --> 54:45.360
There was the royal baby in England

54:45.360 --> 54:46.960
and they pretended to be a nurse

54:46.960 --> 54:48.000
or something like that or-

54:48.000 --> 54:48.400
Yeah.

54:48.400 --> 54:49.200
Talked to a nurse.

54:50.240 --> 54:50.560
What it-

54:52.160 --> 54:53.200
It went like this.

54:53.200 --> 54:53.680
My cuff-

54:53.680 --> 54:54.160
My cuff-

54:54.160 --> 54:57.440
My cuff link managed to hit a button.

54:57.440 --> 54:57.840
That's true.

54:57.840 --> 54:58.320
It's yes.

54:58.320 --> 54:59.920
It's a pretty sad story.

54:59.920 --> 55:02.080
Basically, there was two DJs

55:02.080 --> 55:03.840
and they called up the hospital

55:03.840 --> 55:05.760
where Kate Middleton was giving birth

55:05.760 --> 55:06.960
and they got through to a nurse

55:06.960 --> 55:07.280
and they said,

55:07.280 --> 55:08.720
oh, we're the queen or someone.

55:08.720 --> 55:09.840
I don't know who they said.

55:09.840 --> 55:10.960
And they said,

55:10.960 --> 55:11.840
oh, what's happening?

55:11.840 --> 55:12.960
And she was like, oh, yeah, yeah.

55:12.960 --> 55:14.240
And gave all this information.

55:15.280 --> 55:16.800
And then they aired it

55:16.800 --> 55:19.120
and then the nurse killed herself.

55:19.920 --> 55:20.400
What?

55:20.400 --> 55:21.200
And she left a note saying-

55:21.200 --> 55:22.560
Yay, Media!

55:22.560 --> 55:24.000
Because of-

55:24.000 --> 55:25.280
Did she gave up the good?

55:25.280 --> 55:26.240
Well, she was humiliated.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.200
She was humiliated.

55:27.200 --> 55:28.240
Thought she would lose her job,

55:28.240 --> 55:29.040
get in big trouble.

55:29.040 --> 55:30.160
And she left a note saying

55:30.160 --> 55:31.680
that these DJs basically had to

55:31.680 --> 55:32.640
take care of her family now

55:32.640 --> 55:33.600
and it was their fault.

55:33.600 --> 55:34.320
Whoa!

55:34.320 --> 55:34.800
Yeah.

55:34.800 --> 55:35.360
And they've only-

55:35.360 --> 55:36.400
Like, I think only one of them

55:36.400 --> 55:37.600
has just gone back to work

55:37.600 --> 55:38.560
like over a year later.

55:38.560 --> 55:38.960
And he's like,

55:38.960 --> 55:40.720
he's like very trepidatiously

55:40.720 --> 55:41.440
his first day of work.

55:41.440 --> 55:47.280
It's a squeaker in the morning.

55:47.280 --> 55:51.440
Looks like it's high of 68.

55:51.440 --> 55:53.440
Bit less of a pitch at the pump, then.

55:56.720 --> 55:57.360
Who are-

56:01.360 --> 56:03.360
Here's Bill Callens.

56:07.360 --> 56:08.480
Yeah, it's funny to ask

56:08.480 --> 56:10.880
because everyone that was affected

56:10.880 --> 56:11.840
was on some island.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.360
We got our own problems over here.

56:17.280 --> 56:19.920
That's horrible for everyone involved.

56:19.920 --> 56:20.640
I remember that.

56:20.640 --> 56:21.120
That stuck out.

56:21.120 --> 56:21.440
And I thought-

56:21.440 --> 56:22.160
What really stuck out was

56:22.160 --> 56:23.120
that they were Australian.

56:23.120 --> 56:24.080
They weren't even like-

56:24.080 --> 56:25.520
Because really honestly,

56:25.520 --> 56:25.920
and not to-

56:25.920 --> 56:27.520
I mean, it's very easy

56:27.520 --> 56:28.560
when something horrible like that

56:28.560 --> 56:30.400
happens to like jump on

56:30.400 --> 56:31.760
whoever was immediately like,

56:31.760 --> 56:33.120
what were you guys thinking?

56:33.120 --> 56:34.640
But they were thinking,

56:34.640 --> 56:36.480
we're Australian DJs.

56:36.480 --> 56:38.160
We shouldn't be able to get away

56:38.160 --> 56:38.880
with any of this.

56:38.880 --> 56:39.520
And they were kind of like

56:39.520 --> 56:40.400
trying to do a prank.

56:40.400 --> 56:41.600
I'm not sticking up for anybody.

56:43.440 --> 56:44.000
Yeah, whatever.

56:44.880 --> 56:46.320
Everyone's on their edge of their seats.

56:46.320 --> 56:49.840
Who's Dan in favor of in this story?

56:51.200 --> 56:51.760
The baby.

56:52.640 --> 56:52.960
Oh, no.

56:52.960 --> 56:54.000
I was just going to say that

56:54.000 --> 56:55.360
apparently in their defense,

56:55.360 --> 56:56.800
they said they didn't want it aired.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.720
And it wasn't their decision

56:58.720 --> 57:00.480
in the end and some higher up.

57:00.480 --> 57:00.880
Oh, nice.

57:00.880 --> 57:01.520
That's true, yeah.

57:01.520 --> 57:02.640
The suits did it.

57:02.640 --> 57:03.120
Yep.

57:03.920 --> 57:05.600
Is it true you guys drive

57:05.600 --> 57:07.040
in the middle of the road?

57:07.040 --> 57:09.040
Yes, yes.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.040
Where does the other side turn?

57:19.040 --> 57:20.320
When they turn right,

57:20.320 --> 57:21.920
like they turn so far right

57:21.920 --> 57:23.040
that they go left,

57:23.040 --> 57:24.240
like it goes around.

57:24.240 --> 57:25.280
All right.

57:25.280 --> 57:30.880
Anyways, it's getting close to a D&D hour.

57:30.880 --> 57:32.800
I want to bring out my lovely fiance

57:32.800 --> 57:33.920
who almost didn't make it tonight.

57:33.920 --> 57:37.920
Erin McAfee.

57:49.760 --> 57:50.240
Hello.

57:50.240 --> 57:50.960
Hello.

57:50.960 --> 57:51.360
Hi.

57:53.520 --> 57:54.640
Oh, there's another mic.

57:54.640 --> 57:56.320
I was told there's a mic on a chair.

57:56.320 --> 57:56.960
Yep, yep, yep.

57:58.400 --> 57:59.040
Nice.

57:59.040 --> 57:59.840
All right.

57:59.840 --> 58:00.720
Thank you for having me

58:00.720 --> 58:01.920
at this town meeting.

58:01.920 --> 58:02.640
No, no problem.

58:02.640 --> 58:03.680
I'm excited.

58:03.680 --> 58:04.960
You know we're going to the moon, right?

58:04.960 --> 58:05.840
I heard.

58:05.840 --> 58:06.880
I heard.

58:06.880 --> 58:08.560
I learned how to play a didgeridoo last night.

58:09.360 --> 58:09.920
Oh, cool.

58:09.920 --> 58:10.160
Yeah.

58:11.920 --> 58:12.640
Good night, everybody.

58:13.920 --> 58:15.360
Erin, don't be racist.

58:16.400 --> 58:17.280
Well, they're not like,

58:17.280 --> 58:18.960
that's really offensive to Australian people

58:18.960 --> 58:20.960
because you're supposed to use those

58:20.960 --> 58:25.360
to call your clan to fight for you.

58:26.720 --> 58:28.720
And then we just think it's like an instrument.

58:28.720 --> 58:29.120
And we're like,

58:29.120 --> 58:32.880
and they're like, who wants to fight?

58:35.680 --> 58:38.800
It's like a false alarm every time they come over.

58:38.800 --> 58:40.560
They get on a Qantas flight and they come over.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.320
I heard the wow, wow.

58:42.320 --> 58:44.080
And we're like, no, we was just having a party, man.

58:44.080 --> 58:44.720
It's burning, man.

58:45.760 --> 58:46.400
Yeah.

58:46.400 --> 58:47.600
Well, thank you, mate.

58:48.160 --> 58:53.920
I learned while in a pool, soup very sober.

58:53.920 --> 58:57.920
And my friend was holding it down for me to play.

58:57.920 --> 58:59.840
And that's, that's how I learned it.

58:59.840 --> 59:00.320
How was it?

59:04.320 --> 59:04.960
Photoshop.

59:07.920 --> 59:08.320
Yeah.

59:08.320 --> 59:09.280
That was a lot of fun.

59:09.280 --> 59:12.080
Also on the way home, in our car, we were,

59:12.080 --> 59:13.840
there was like an hour or not an hour,

59:13.840 --> 59:15.520
about half hour where everyone in the car

59:15.520 --> 59:17.360
got really good at our Australian accents.

59:17.360 --> 59:18.240
And then we started to lose them.

59:18.240 --> 59:20.400
Can I hear your really good Australian accent right now?

59:21.040 --> 59:21.280
Yes.

59:21.280 --> 59:21.840
Yes.

59:23.840 --> 59:24.560
Jeff.

59:24.560 --> 59:25.520
Yeah, talk to Sarah.

59:26.560 --> 59:27.040
Sarah.

59:28.720 --> 59:29.760
No, no, I can do it.

59:31.120 --> 59:33.360
No, that was a deaf Australian person.

59:33.360 --> 59:34.880
That was a deaf Australian person.

59:34.880 --> 59:35.360
More.

59:36.880 --> 59:37.280
Buddy.

59:38.000 --> 59:38.480
Buddy.

59:41.920 --> 59:43.120
Come over later.

59:43.120 --> 59:45.920
We're going to make pizzas on the barbie.

59:47.200 --> 59:50.000
And, and we're going to talk about Joe.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.720
He's been seven all the time.

59:54.400 --> 59:56.160
And we're, and we're proud or concerned.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.480
Sarah, scale of one to 10.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.040
How was that?

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.400
Was that a passable accent?

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.120
It was English.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:05.920
That's fair.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.440
Does anybody really have a barbie in Australia?

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.480
Or is that just like?

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.600
Also, they don't call them shrimps.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.400
They call them prawns.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.440
You don't put a shrimp on a barbie.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.440
Yeah, they don't call them shrimps.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.640
They call them prawns.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.320
Knock it off.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.520
Why are you doing that?

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.600
I'm sorry.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.400
Am I right, Sarah?

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.840
You don't say a shrimp on the barbie.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.400
You would say a prawn.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:26.960
Erin.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.240
Well, yeah, no, I've never,

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.240
my dad's never put a shrimp on the barbie ever.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:30.800
It's a prawn.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.400
Well, that's a, that's a dad thing.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.040
Or even a prawn.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:33.280
No.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.800
Did you guys like collectively say,

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.240
okay, let's stop doing it

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.680
because that's all we're hearing

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.040
every time we go over there.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.200
Yeah, it's a bit cliched now.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:41.760
We're just like, oh.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.720
Yeah, no, but I'll say,

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.920
you don't, you don't barbecue a shrimp,

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.360
but you guys don't even call them shrimps.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.400
You call them prawns, right?

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.200
Prawns, yeah. Yeah, we've been over this.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:49.600
Erin.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.040
Yes, Rob?

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.720
Erin, what songs did you learn

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.680
on the Digery Do?

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.200
I learned Slow Rumbling Wind.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.840
I learned Mummy Opening His Mouth.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.000
I learned Despair.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.760
And I learned Hey, Ricola.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.560
That's something different.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.440
That's an Alpenhorn.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.680
Well, you play it the same way.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.440
It's the same song, different instrument.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:19.680
Is that right?

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.240
Yeah, you have to, you have to relax

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.360
your lips like a,

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.880
like they're not a part of your face.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:27.440
I'll teach you.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.880
So you have to relax your lips

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.600
and then you blow air through your lips.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.720
Like a jump, like.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.200
Get up on the mic.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.160
Get up on the mic there.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:39.920
Great podcast.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.840
Oh, Jim, do you, I'm assuming the answer is no,

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.960
but it'd be so cool

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.680
if it was yes.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:50.240
Is there an Australian cinematic hero

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.080
from the 80s who like comes down to Australia

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.760
and he's not, he's not familiar

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.360
with Australian ways,

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.120
but he plays a banjo and he,

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:00.560
you know, he's like,

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.840
he's like always eating hot dogs.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.640
And then he's like walking around

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.760
Melbourne, but he's like,

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.480
doesn't get it.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.680
And people are like,

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.480
give me your wallet.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.520
And he's like, whoa, that's,

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.320
that's a knife.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.400
Like that really is a knife.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.840
I would, this is a smaller knife.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.720
That's all I have.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.680
And then like, like he,

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.120
because he's like the equivalent,

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.680
you know, of the crocodile dandy.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.840
Do you think it's cool

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.120
that all supervillains want Australia

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.000
when they join forces with aliens?

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.160
Do you?

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.600
Man, what's her problem?

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.280
Right?

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.680
Lex Luthor in the original Superman movie,

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.200
the list goes on and on.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.440
Is your family from Australia?

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.800
Were your parents also from there?

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.280
Like,

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.880
No, they moved there in the 80s.

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.320
They're from their Irish.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:56.720
Irish.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.560
Interesting.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.680
Can we hear your Irish accent?

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.640
Yeah, let's do that.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:01.840
Yeah.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.080
Sarah and Erin,

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.160
I want you guys to have an Irish conversation together.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.760
Okay. Or contest.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.120
Irish, Irish, come.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:17.840
Specifically 80s Irish though.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.080
Let's get magical, magical.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.040
You know, the song that I started the show with,

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.760
was from Sanadu.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.320
Yeah.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.600
Which is, you know, Olivia.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:31.920
Thank you.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.800
I was talking to Sarah,

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.920
but you're welcome.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.960
My wife lived next to Olivia Newton-John.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.440
Is that right?

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:40.720
Yes.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.400
I was on a cruise ship one time,

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.120
doing a comedy show and I was like 25.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.360
And there were these two girls that walked

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.320
like in the middle of the night,

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.840
onto the pool deck and into the jacuzzi.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:52.880
And I was like, oh my god,

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.880
these most beautiful girls in the world.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.240
Then I realized, okay,

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.760
probably well underage.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.360
They were like 15, 16 years old.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.000
Okay.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.720
So I was like, okay, these are little girls.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.200
Then a woman comes out,

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.480
hotter than them by a mile.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:07.920
It was the mother.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.040
It was Olivia Newton-John.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.480
She was fucking dead sexy.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.040
She was like Olivia.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:11.760
Bam.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.480
Huh?

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:12.960
Bam.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.040
So anyway, I'm fucking Olivia Newton-John.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.000
And I mean fucking her.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.560
All right, let's try it.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:23.760
What?

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.160
Baddie.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:25.920
Is this Irish?

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.760
That I'm doing Australian.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.880
No, no, no, you just,

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.360
not your Irish.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:29.760
Irish, Irish.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.800
This is Irish.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.240
Oh, I thought Birdie was going to do

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.080
a Irish and I was going to do Australian.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.120
You're both going to do Irish.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.000
Both Irish.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.200
We're both going to do Irish.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:37.360
Yeah.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:37.920
Yeah.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.480
Okay.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:38.800
Go.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.080
Birdie.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:48.880
Erin.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:56.240
Birdie, I was, I was, I was,

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.000
I was fishing outside the school today.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.960
And I saw a man that looked very

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.080
sad in a suit staring at the children.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.880
He reached his vodka and repetition.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:24.960
Were there yellow moons, green clovers, blue stars?

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:36.800
No, what did you, what did you think about that, Birdie?

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.880
I don't, I don't think he was a dab.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:39.840
Any of the kids, no.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.800
He didn't look like he had any sparkle in his eye.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:51.840
I don't know how to do an Irish accent.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.080
That sounded like one, maybe.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.440
Maybe I was projecting.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.040
Discretion is a better part of Valor.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:05:59.920
I love that about you, sir.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.680
Where's me gold?

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.200
Irish Jerry Seinfeld.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.200
Oh, it's me, McSeinfeld.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.560
Jerry McSeinfeld.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.560
Oh, have you ever noticed that your clovers are never in the washing machine?

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:23.200
Oh, what's up with rainbows?

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.840
How many purple hearts do you need?

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.920
Isn't that for Vietnam?

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.480
What kind of luck is that if you got a purple heart?

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.160
It means you got bad luck, not good.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.200
I just noticed these things.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:51.040
Now, Dan, would you give me Korean, Korean Johnny Carson?

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.560
This is going to be bad.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.680
Korean Johnny Carson.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:07:09.360
South Korea, Johnny Carson.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.320
South Korea, Johnny Carson.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:11.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.640
Have you noticed?

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:22.880
I drive down Burbank today.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.960
You sound like Mr. Brainwashed.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.920
It was so hot in Burma.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.760
How hot was it?

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:42.880
I noticed bird notice eating worms and spit it out so hot.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.880
Russian Johnny Carson.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:56.240
In Burbank, monologue, do you?

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:05.680
This is the worst show I've ever been a part of.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.040
No, no, one more, one more.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.200
Black Popeye.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.440
Let's just make sure I'm in TMZ tomorrow.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.400
Give me some Black Popeye, because I-

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.320
Black Popeye, Black Popeye.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.480
Black Popeye, Black Popeye.

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.480
Black Popeye.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.000
Not doing Black Popeye.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.160
All right, I got American Indian Roseanne Barr.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.920
Native American Roseanne Barr.

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.760
Okay, Canadian Mr. T.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:50.960
Hey, fool, I pity the fool that don't care about their mother.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.280
Whoa, snuck in a Black Popeye over the plate.

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:05.920
Not cool.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:10.000
Let's say that there was a movie called Black Popeye,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.160
and Robert Altman made it.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:15.920
And it was the full cast, but Popeye was Black.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.440
Who would be the cast?

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.120
Curtis Fittysent Jackson as Popeye.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:21.680
As Popeye.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.520
Olive Oil.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.360
Iggy is Azalea.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.000
Jada Pinkett.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.080
Jada Pinkett.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:30.720
Zola Oil.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.520
Black Olive Oil.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.000
Tiny Lister as Brutus.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:34.560
That's good.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.680
Brut, Brut, Brut, Brut.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.240
What's a Bruto?

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:36.720
What's his name?

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:37.440
Bruto.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.480
Tiny Lister?

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.440
Yeah, if he's still got it.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.400
Tiny Lister, yeah.

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.600
Still got it.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.560
Never lost it.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.600
Who's Poop Deck Pappy?

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.000
Morgan Freeman, for sure.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.040
Morgan Freeman, if I can put it.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:47.360
No.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.560
Are you talking now or then?

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.040
Oh, then, I guess.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:52.080
Red Fox.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.280
Red Fox?

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:53.840
Oh, Red Fox.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.760
We could sell this tomorrow.

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.800
If it were 30 years ago.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.280
Exactly.

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.440
All right, so.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.640
We could sell this yesterday.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.960
All right, so you'd be Red Fox as a Poop Deck Pappy.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.800
No, no, no, no.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.520
I'm not going to be there.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.560
All right.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.600
Jeff, please do all the characters.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.880
Hispanic Hogan's Heroes.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.200
Hogan, you dick!

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.440
All right, great.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.600
Yo, you locked us up in your homes?

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.960
Fucking let us out, dick!

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.640
I know some things.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.120
I don't know why you would know more than this.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.080
All right, okay.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.840
Jump down your bed.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.200
I'm sorry, Davis.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:37.680
I didn't.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:38.960
Eskimo Hitler.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:39.760
Eskimo Hitler?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:42.880
Eskimo Hitler.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.200
He's cold, but he's mad.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:53.920
He's really cold.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.880
He's cold, but he's mad.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.400
All right.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:02.480
Well, welcome to the Puerto Rican Churchill.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.440
I feel like my heart is shivering.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.520
Everything's getting nervous.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.200
Give me some Puerto Rican Churchill.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.920
I speak softly in homes and carry big stick homes.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.680
That's Roosevelt, you fucking liar.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.720
All right, fine.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.320
Alligator Lincoln.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.880
Abraham Lincoln, but he's an alligator.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.440
Alligator.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.160
He's an alligator.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.120
Has an alligator.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:38.480
Okay, first score, seven eggs ago.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.640
Seven eggs ago?

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.120
How do you think Crock-n-Roll's Bizarre Time?

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.320
Alligators.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.480
My eggs, all right.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.440
Sarah, give me,

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:55.760
I want, let's see, Dan, give her one.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:56.480
Give Sarah one.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.120
Throw one on her.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.240
Elvis as a robot.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:05.920
Robot Elvis, Sarah.

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:08.880
Okay.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:25.280
Okay, Sarah, just say, you ain't nothing but a hound dog and a robot voice.

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.640
You are no longer a hound, all right.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.200
That was actually a really good Elvis, yeah.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.040
All right, yeah.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.760
Okay, so we should probably roll into the D&D.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.240
What do we got?

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.600
We got everybody we need.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.000
So we should probably say goodbye to, good night to Sarah.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.280
No, Rob, you got to play D&D.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.160
She was a bartender.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.760
She's walking around with like 200 bucks.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.640
No, she can stay, but we can bring somebody else to play.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.280
I thought I was going to help Spencer tonight.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.000
Oh.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.680
Right now we should have enough people for D&D in general, right?

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.000
I mean, four players.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.280
We talked in the green room about Rob being the dungeon master's helper.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.960
I don't think that Spencer was involved in that conversation.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.120
No, I think it would be cool.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.760
Let's try it out.

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.000
Rob as Spencer's assistant.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.160
Well, then we'd need another player.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.120
Is Woolly Roberts here?

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.360
Woolly Roberts come to the stage.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:21.920
Would you join us?

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.920
All right, so we're saying goodbye to Sarah.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.720
Thanks, Sarah.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.520
Thank you, Sarah.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.560
Thank you, Sarah.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:36.160
But Sarah, if I want another drink, you'll still be in the room, right?

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.000
No, she's done.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.400
Sarah's over.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:41.680
Wow.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.880
My reign has begun.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.000
I think earlier we were trying to talk about Skyscraper Skip, right?

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:49.760
Skyscraper.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.120
Yay.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.040
Woolly Roberts, everybody, from the Real Life Sci-Fi, what's it called?

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.480
The Real Life Sci-Fi podcast, which is quite fucking good fun.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:06.640
So I dig that. Also, Woolly is the clan leader of my Clash of Clans clan, and he is...

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.760
So you've got to come up with a better title for that position.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.520
What about Grand Dragon?

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.040
Dungeons and Grand Dragons.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:27.360
All right, so Spencer or Rob, as Spencer's assistant, it's your job to dispense the

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.200
character sheets for us.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:29.440
Yes.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.000
I heard someone gasp at that.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.920
Erin, you weren't here last week, but Demorge played Dignity Sarsgard to great effect as Obama.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:47.040
And I'm assuming that Willie will be Chris de Burgh.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.440
There's no way he's doing that, right?

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.680
There's no way. I mean, I got Sharpie.

01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.160
I don't know whose that is.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.080
So Rob, look at the names on the top of them.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.760
That one's Dan, yep.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.680
Adventure. This is for Dan.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.440
Head up to Dan.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.080
This is a nightmare.

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.240
Rob, you're doing it wrong. You're doing it wrong.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.960
This is an edit point for Dustin.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.680
Spencer, do Turtle George Washington?

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:22.800
Uh, let's see. What did George Washington do?

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.760
He sailed across the Seven Seas.

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.720
Yes, that was exactly what he did.

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.440
Let's...

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.720
For you and the booth, I'm a...

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.280
Murderer.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.720
I'm swapping mics so that my...

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.480
That's my way of reaching Sharp, so...

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:35.600
There we go.

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.920
On Christmas Day.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.280
All right, so edit point back in.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:39.840
All right, Spencer, we have...

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.560
That happened, right?

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.040
Didn't they murder a bunch of British people on Christmas?

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:43.360
No.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:53.120
No. Either way, either way, Grace7Truth.org, Grace7Truth.org.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.680
Also, while this is being all ridiculous,

01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.840
I'm going to be up in Pittsburgh, I think,

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.240
September 19th or something that weekend.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.200
You have dates now?

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.160
I have a date.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.920
This is the first date I'll ever have.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.440
Last one, too.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:08.720
I'll be at...

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.320
This thing is called Knights of the Arcade.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.040
It's basically an elongated version of the D&D

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.560
pot thing that we do here,

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.720
but they wanted me to come guess it up.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.160
Elongated?

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:21.600
Yeah, it's like...

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.440
The whole session is like a D&D.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.240
So it's 10 hours?

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.600
It's like 10 hours.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.520
It's a real marathon,

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.360
but we provide free water,

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.720
and it's a great time.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.560
If any of you guys who live in LA are out in Philadelphia...

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.840
What did I say, Pittsburgh?

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:38.400
Pittsburgh.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.760
I don't know where places are.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.200
Home of the sandwich.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.640
What?

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.600
Home of the sandwich.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.600
It's by the Monongahila and the...

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.720
Whatever the fuck, Rivers.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.240
Home of the sandwich.

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.600
All right, so Spencer,

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.680
Willie, you're going to be Christopher.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.480
He's a rogue and a thief,

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.800
and he wrote one hit.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.160
He wrote Lady in Red.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.360
Aaron has become Dignity Sarsgaard,

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.120
who last time was Obama, our president.

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.760
Spencer, do you want to take us away?

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.080
I feel like maybe Rob should take it away.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.440
Yeah.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.120
Read that first top paragraph.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.560
So, I don't have my glasses.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.960
Oh, man, get ready.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:29.600
We are ready.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.200
When last we met our heroes,

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.600
we're just outside the juicery,

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.160
where...

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.520
I can't pronounce that word.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.160
What is that?

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:42.960
Darm von.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.360
Darm von, the drunken knight accused

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.360
the local priest of misdeeds

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.800
and fell upon his own blade.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.840
Father Tinder reacted by calling off

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:52.800
the Jewish tourer,

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:55.360
wanting to inform the wife and the kids,

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.240
but Sharpie insisted that they do it,

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.000
sparing him the trouble

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.200
and headed to Mrs...

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:02.640
Darm von.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:02.880
Don...

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.400
Darm von.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.200
Oh, shit, I scrolled down.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.640
Take over, tag out.

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.720
Mrs. Darm von's home,

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.760
where they broke the news

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:16.800
and looked for clues,

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:19.280
convinced that the father was up to no good.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.120
Meanwhile, Dignity and Chris de Burgh

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.640
went back to the constabulary

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.160
and met with Spizzbulb,

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.000
Bulb, the gnome they had saved.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.080
They were immediately suspicious of Spizzbulb

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.200
when thoughts sought to flee,

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.480
but the party reunited

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.520
after Mrs. Darm von

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.440
spermed Sharpie's advances.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.560
With Sharpie and Quark,

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.520
the gang retired and conspired

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.920
and drew up a plan to break

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.360
into Father Tinder's house,

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.920
hoping to find incriminating evidence.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.840
But what would our heroes uncover?

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.440
What evils may they face?

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.520
What laws would they be breaking?

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.120
Find out now, time.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:52.720
Teamwork!

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.560
You know, you never realize

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.880
that you think they might be good at something

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.320
until you see someone else.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.440
What, what, what the?

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.560
I didn't bring my glasses.

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.080
You sure didn't, you sure didn't.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.240
I can't read with the shape that small.

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.120
You sure can't.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:11.520
What kind of...

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.320
It's not fair.

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.000
It's not fair.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:14.400
No, it's God.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.800
You don't do notes in the middle of a show.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.440
Oh, I do.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:19.360
Who's not fair?

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:19.920
It's not cool.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.440
The college hears themselves as

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.040
assistant Dungeon Master.

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:23.760
Assistant?

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.040
Not Dungeon Master?

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.480
Bring...

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.760
You said my glasses.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.080
I didn't know I was coming up.

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.280
You didn't tell me.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.320
Yeah, I didn't tell him.

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.600
I snuck him in.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:34.720
I just, you know.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.600
All right, Suspenser.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.680
It's me and

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.120
Chris de Burgh

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.000
or Dignity breaking into the house right now.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:42.640
What's happening?

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.960
You guys, you guys are all, yeah.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:45.920
Okay.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.280
So it's just nighttime.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.120
You guys just left Spizzbulb's house.

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.040
He gave you a black bundle of cloth

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.080
and you guys were gonna sneak into Tinder's house.

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.920
And the bundle of cloth,

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.440
he didn't specify what it was.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.280
He said use this in case of emergency,

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.200
but also if you use it by the border

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.320
or by the barrier,

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.360
that bad things would happen.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.560
Don't leave town with it, I think.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.920
It'll break, yeah.

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:07.360
If the barrier's turned on.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.760
But it'll be good in case of emergency

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.440
within the boundaries of that thing.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.160
That's what he said.

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.760
He didn't really say that much about it,

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.240
to be honest.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.200
But that was the implication.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:15.680
Yep.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.560
That was the inference.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:19.760
Okay, so where are we standing right now?

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.400
You guys are right outside of Spizzbulb's tower,

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.240
just kind of in Rosebook in general.

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.440
It's really late at night,

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.120
like maybe one o'clock, you know.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.880
Well, you and Chris de Burgh

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.080
are the stealthy ones.

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:34.080
So, I mean, I could come with,

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.440
but I should keep a perimeter.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.040
But we're about to break into

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.240
Father Tender's crib right now, right?

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.200
Right, yeah.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.800
Okay, so it's me and...

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:42.880
And DeBerg.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.000
And Chris de Burgh.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.600
We're gonna go in and break into this guy's house.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:48.400
We think he has a power shard.

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.440
And we're gonna go break into this guy's house.

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.920
I have a teleport cape.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.200
I can't do Kumail, sorry.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.160
Can I bring somebody with me?

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:01.600
I want you to commit to doing a bad Kumail, I suppose.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.680
Commit to being a bad Pakistani.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.480
Who has a teleport cape?

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.360
According to my gear, I've got a teleport cape.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.080
I feel like you must have Dan's item sheet.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.400
How did that happen?

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:14.960
I don't know.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.200
What kind of circus are you running here?

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.000
Oh, goodness.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.040
Sorry, I just...

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.440
Chris de Burgh definitely doesn't have one of those.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.000
Yep.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.920
All right, so, Chris, here's the deal.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.760
I examine the house to look for entrances and exits and stuff.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.600
You see the juicery?

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.760
It's a low-ceiling, rectangular building

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.080
attached to a larger cylindrical building.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.000
That's like a normal house,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.640
so it's like the juicery is attached to the house.

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.520
You see the juicery?

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.760
It's got these fine stained glass windows

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.800
depicting roses and fruits and decanters and mugs

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.160
in great detail.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.320
The rest of the building is dressed in roses

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.320
as is tradition around Rosebook.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.720
So, one of the buildings is where the juice is made.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.560
The other one is where Tinder is.

01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:58.960
The fudges.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:21:59.360
Yeah.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.520
That's around the corner.

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.280
One's for milk and one's for lemonade.

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:03.760
Yeah.

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.160
If you go around the corner, I think it's fudges.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.040
That's like fudges.

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.880
If I put on my goggles of night, do I see anything else?

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.280
You can see all sorts of stuff.

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.800
That was Rob Schrab helping.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.840
Eeeeeee.

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.200
So, yeah, you put on your goggles of night

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.280
and you can see clearly in the darkness,

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.600
you can see into the juicery where metal and wooden devices

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.160
lie dormant inside the juicery.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.840
I go towards the dwelling where Father Tinder lives.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:38.960
All right, you do that.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.040
You see, well, I mean, they're attached.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.080
It's like the same building.

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:42.400
Okay.

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.600
There's two parts of it.

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.280
Christopher, you probably have a...

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.680
I can turn invisible.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.280
You can turn invisible?

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:49.680
Yeah.

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.320
Well, do that, but also you have probably a Thieves kit

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.360
where you can break into,

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.480
silently break into like a lock and open a door, right?

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.040
Okay.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.080
Hey, yeah.

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.120
Guys, remember, Sharpie, what are you doing here?

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.880
I can't go any further than this.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.240
You're going to wait by the van.

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.520
I can't go any further.

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.720
He had it in his breast pocket.

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.680
Like he patted his breast when he was talking about God's day.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.600
Okay, but I'm slinking back.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:13.840
Okay.

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.080
We go up to the door.

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.120
Chris, oh, pick that lock.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:19.760
That's God's day.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.760
I'm going to turn invisible, pick the lock,

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:24.720
and then look for a breast pocket.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.080
So a prom night.

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.000
That's what they call...

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:30.880
That's Steve Tom.

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.160
That's him turning invisible.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.000
What's him picking the lock?

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:39.760
What?

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:49.920
What's him picking the lock sound like?

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.920
And just like that, the lock is open.

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.280
Roger Huebner is in the house.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:56.640
The lock was a cat's mouth.

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:02.720
Rob, can you open the door,

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:14.160
but also do a chainsaw and a lawn mower at the same time?

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:14.960
Pretty amazing.

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.440
That's a joke for three people.

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:19.680
I don't get it.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:23.040
There was a sound effects guy at Comedy Sports in Milwaukee,

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.440
and he's passed now.

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:25.920
He was a...

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:26.880
Hilarious.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.680
He would do sound effects on them.

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.120
The referee for Comedy Sports would say,

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.120
Roger could do three sound effects at the same time,

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:35.200
but the three sound effects were always...

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.480
Like, give me the three sound effects.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.400
This is what it sounded like every night.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.320
Okay, give me three sound effects.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.840
The three sound effects are...

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.280
Roger, I'm going to...

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.360
It was...

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.640
I'm trying to think of what the three were.

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:48.880
It was...

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.400
I'm going to start a vacuum cleaner,

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.880
and then I'm going to start an electric can opener,

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.080
and then a chainsaw.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:58.560
All right.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.000
I think you're going to have to act it out for me to do mine.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.920
So here we go, starting with the vacuum cleaner.

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.280
Electric can opener.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:12.640
Chainsaw.

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.920
Amazing!

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.280
People would go crazy.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.640
If you've never heard a man hum,

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.560
then hum louder, then fart.

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.160
Well, it's nice that he has a legacy.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.800
R.A.P., wherever you are.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.000
Rest in peace, Roger Haberler.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.320
He died in the sound booth.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.000
Oh, really?

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.360
Did he really?

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.680
He died on the job?

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:56.800
Yeah.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.760
Did they record it?

01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.480
No.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.760
And I'm not making a joke about this.

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.200
This is not funny at all!

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.280
Stop down and be emotional about this.

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.880
They buried him with his microphone.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.080
That's great.

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.240
I got to meet him, and I heard him do the thing in the sound effect,

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.680
and I was like, that's fucking great.

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.200
And they called him Mr. Voice, right?

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.560
Mr. Voice?

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.640
I think that's the only thing he didn't have.

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.840
I think he did. Mr. Sound Effects, probably. Mr. Mouth?

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.400
Mouth.

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:27.920
We called our guy Comedy Sports on A, Mr. Voice.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.360
Mouth and a microphone alone.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.760
But he was like, he would make...

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.400
A lot of the sound effects sound as wet.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.440
Yeah.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.960
So I'm going to make a peanut butter sandwich.

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.240
They sound very fart-like.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:42.880
Yes.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:44.080
That's the peanut butter sandwich.

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.400
All right, so Spencer...

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.080
You want...

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.280
Christopher?

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.960
Would you want to unlock the door again?

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:51.280
Yes.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:51.840
Yes.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:52.480
Ah, I...

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.000
Christopher, we've already opened the door, right?

01:26:59.040 --> 01:26:59.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.000
I don't know.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.640
Okay, so I creep in and examine the surroundings inside the doorway.

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:08.640
Yeah, yeah, you do that.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.920
And inside you see several strange contraptions.

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.280
Wooden racks with handles and gears and great wheels.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.680
The walls of the juicery are lined with barrels,

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.320
each with roses affixed to the lids and sides.

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.520
You see drums of apples, oranges, grapes,

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.000
raspberries, bananas, pineapples,

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.040
and even the most sinister fruit of all, the pear.

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.160
There's a small wooden hatch in the floor

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.600
and a small wooden barred gate

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.000
joining the juicery and the house part of the building.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.640
I go to the hatch and tell Chris to try to quietly open it.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:41.120
Which one?

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:41.680
Which one?

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.160
The hatch.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:42.800
In the floor?

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.120
Yes.

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:43.760
All right.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:44.480
Yeah, okay.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.560
I'm going to quietly open it

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.320
and then drop my robot baby in there.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:49.840
Okay.

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:52.960
Just that's, I'm not discouraging that at all,

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:55.200
but I mean, it's made of metal

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:56.720
and dropping that would make noise.

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.880
I mean, do it anyway.

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:01.920
We're trying to break in at night to rob a shard

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:04.000
off a guy's sleeping breast pocket.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.440
But what would it sound like?

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.280
You don't know it might not be that loud.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.680
We can't afford to make noises right now, Chris.

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.960
It might not be that loud.

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:21.760
We open the hatch and this is the hatch

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.240
that adjoins the juicery to the house.

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.240
Well, if it's the hatch in the floor, it doesn't.

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:28.640
There's a door and a hatch.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:30.560
We go to the door.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.520
I want the shard.

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.560
I don't care about the juicery.

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:33.440
All right.

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.240
You open, wait, wait, you go to the door?

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.040
Yes.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.480
You go to the door.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:39.120
It's locked.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.120
Chris, use your thieves kit.

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.560
I'd like to use my thieves kit

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:47.760
and unlock the door while admiring my dragon dick.

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:48.960
Yeah.

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.000
Well, it's not on you.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.320
It's just, I think it's in your bag or whatever.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.240
I'll still look at it.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:54.480
Yeah.

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:56.080
It gives you focus.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.480
It's like an energy drink.

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.760
But yeah, well, that's not, I mean, that's a weird reaction.

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.960
Anyway, you do it.

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:05.600
It opens.

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.080
Chris, Chris, you've got your,

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:16.240
your goggles on, your low light vision stuff.

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:17.760
Yeah.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.320
Lead the way.

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.040
Tell me what you see.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.920
I lead the way and tell Jeff what I see.

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:25.040
Quark.

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.160
That's right.

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.040
What is that noise?

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:29.840
That's his vision.

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.040
That's his little light goggles.

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.080
Those sound different.

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.880
This room is a combination sitting in dining room,

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.400
a wooden chair or a wooden table with chairs dominates half

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.680
and a small fireplace with nicer cushion chairs dominates

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.560
the other half.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:48.400
You see a small door and also a small enclosed stairwell

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.760
leading to the second floor.

01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:53.280
The cushions from the chairs.

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.440
We're going to attach those to our shoes.

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:55.920
All right.

01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:56.240
Okay.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:02.240
We, we, we make, we, we, Rob.

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.040
What does that sound like?

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.560
We fashion cushion shoes.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.520
Optimus Prime just came in.

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:14.240
Yeah.

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:18.240
All right.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.560
You guys are playing a CD-ROM video game for kids from the 90s.

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:23.680
All right.

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.720
I feel like he was probably sleeping upstairs

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.880
because the bedroom and the house like this would probably be upstairs.

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:38.080
I, I, I, I use my ears, my, my, my, my Noma here is to,

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:40.240
to detect where the snoring is coming from Spencer.

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.320
It's coming from upstairs.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:42.640
All right.

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:47.200
I, I, I creep, I creep up first and I draw,

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:51.200
and I, I, I draw, um, what's my smallest weapon?

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.560
I draw like a, like a dagger or something.

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:53.680
Probably a dagger, yeah.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:53.840
Yeah.

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.840
I, I draw a dagger and walk up the stairs.

01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:58.480
Okay.

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:01.440
So before you can get up those stairs, you hear,

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.120
you hear a noise.

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.000
The stomping of feet and the breaking of glass.

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:06.960
Actually.

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:13.840
Smash, reverse order.

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:16.000
You hear smashing a glass and then,

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.320
and then, and then the breaking of the feeding.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:22.480
That's what you hear.

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.680
That sounded much better.

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:25.680
I'm sorry folks.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:28.080
Then from upstairs you hear a, no, no.

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:39.920
No, no, no.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.560
Oh, he's good.

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:45.360
Um, I, I, I charge up the stairs and kick in the door.

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:49.440
Upstairs you find Father Tinder, Tinder,

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.520
sprawled out on the floor covered in blood

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.440
that streams from his mouth and face.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:54.080
What?

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.440
He groans weakly.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:59.440
Are you saying that we've fucking missed this

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.360
because we tied cushions to our feet?

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.560
He, he groans weakly.

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:07.600
As if in pain.

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.320
Do we see, do we see the attacker?

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.840
Uh, wait, do you?

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:15.520
Yep.

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:19.600
A shadowy figure wielding a thin fencing foil

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.680
is escaping through the broken window

01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:23.360
and out to the juicery roof.

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:25.680
I lunge toward him with my dagger in hand

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:28.800
as fast as I can to try to apprehend him and stab him.

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:29.360
All right.

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:32.560
Uh, yeah, you, uh, which, what did you draw?

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.040
Dagger.

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:33.360
Okay.

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:34.640
What's the damage on that?

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.360
Do I have a dagger?

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.240
I don't even know.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:38.960
It's 1d4 if it's not, if it's non-magic.

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:41.200
Well, actually it's 1d3 since you're small.

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:43.840
Um, yeah, I don't have a dagger in my inventory,

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:46.320
but I'm assuming I've stolen so many knives.

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.200
All right.

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.840
Leaping after the foe, you catch yourself

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:52.000
on a piece of broken shattered glass

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.480
that's on the floor and you slip and fall

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:56.240
and you stab yourself in the stomach.

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:56.640
What?

01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:01.120
Three damage to yourself and you fall flat on your face.

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.160
Did you roll a one?

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:02.960
Yeah, I sure did.

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:03.840
Piece of shit.

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:04.960
I need new dice.

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:07.600
I, uh, straight up need new dice.

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:08.800
I must do, I'd like to do,

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.080
can I do multiple things?

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.680
Can I, um, maybe?

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.160
I saw something about blinding.

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.960
You have a blinding bomb, I think, maybe?

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:20.000
I throw a blinding bomb at him, use my sneak attack,

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
and then become invisible.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
All right, well, you can't sneak attack him.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
And then I go by Roth IRA.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
And I provide for my family.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
And I, and I, and I live a full life.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
And wait until I can sell high.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
And I have a beautiful funeral.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Well, you can't sneak attack him

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
because, uh, he, he's not like, he's aware of you somehow.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
You're already invisible already

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
because you made yourself invisible before.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
It's true.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Can I use the, uh, can I intensify wins

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
and push him, try to push him back

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
into the window he's sneaking out of?

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
You can, you can do that.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
But, uh, yeah.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
What does it sound like?

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
It would sound pretty interesting, I'm sure.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
The wins are about that fierce.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
It doesn't really affect him at all.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:20.000
I have to ask at this point, uh, if I,

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I'm outside, I'm, I'm positioned at a,

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000
being the microchip to this Punisher Comics adventure.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Yeah.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Like, am I seeing somebody coming out a window?

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Curiously, you didn't see, uh,

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
you didn't see anyone sneak onto the property or whatever.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
But wait, we're,

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Oh, I didn't see anything.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I don't think my thoughts are audible.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
But, uh,

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
You don't see anything.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
You don't see anything,

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
but you do hear the shattering of glass

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
as the windows being broken.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
It's on the far side of the building.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Sounds like something's breaking over there.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
At that point, I remember our signal.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
What was our signal? I would do what?

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Silver dollar. Silver dollar.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Silver dollar. Silver dollar.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
But I say twice, right?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
You say it a bunch, but in a panic.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
I forget the code.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Avenger.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Silver dollar.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
It means Avenger's going to go, like,

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
fly around to the place of the sound.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
I want Avenger to do, like, a little drone surveillance.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Avenger's a helicopter.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Um, yeah.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Avenger comes back.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
He's like, I saw a small thing

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
running off.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
You don't come back to me. I'm following you.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Oh, sorry about that.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Spencer, from where I'm standing,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
am I able to see the guy?

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
No, it's on the other side of the building

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
where you guys are standing.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Do I notice anything strange

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
of somebody who's spent a lot of time

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
in good old Rose Book?

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Not other than hearing the shattering

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
of glass on the other side of the glass.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Mesh.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Alright, well, I stand

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
and I stew

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
because this is a conundrum.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
I want to protect these people,

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
but they're also stealing.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
So I feel very guilty.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Guilt.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
And I take a gold piece

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
out of my pocket.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I put it in my mouth and spit it up into the air

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
and hit it on my heel and then throw it on the ground.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Alright.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I'm running. I'm running to a Avenger.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I'm using Avenger to, like,

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
we had an agreement with Avenger.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
I'm not...

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
My character isn't my weight.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
You don't have to make it sound like

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
a kid from a hot dog commercial.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
That's how they sell hot dogs.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
I didn't lose my ice cream at a storm drain.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000
You can stow the tubas.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Thank you.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
My character's built like Stephen Merchant

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
just for the record.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
I had a deal with Avenger.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Avenger's following the thing

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
faster than I can.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I'm following Avenger.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
You have a deal.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Okay, so you give chase.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Until you see what looks

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
like a massive ice crystal

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
in the middle of the street,

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
you find six armed guards standing

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
frozen in a combination of terror

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
and magic.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Shimmering force energy

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
kind of traps them in place

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
and they can't move at all in case

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
there's a glowing glass life substance.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I mean, this is about

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
what I predicted, if I'm honest.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I note

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
that distraction, but I continue on.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
I'm chasing the...

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
You continue on

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
towards Mrs. Darne Vaughn's house.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Welcome.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Let's cut to the inside

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
of the house.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
What's happened in there?

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
The attacker that killed

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
or at least tried to assail

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Father Tinder has left the building.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Oh, he's gone.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Is that who Sharpie is chasing right now?

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Yes.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I get up off of my ass

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
and I examine Father Tinder

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
to see if the shard is still in his breast pocket.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
You don't find any breast pockets.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Is he alive?

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Yeah, he's grown in weekly.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I say, Father Tinder, what happened?

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I was attacked by...

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
It was that goddamn gnome.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Fizzbulb?

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I don't know his name. Fizzbam?

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Stefan?

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
It's Fizzbulb. He attacked you?

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Oh, man, yeah.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Are you okay?

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
I'm a gnome, but I'm on your side, man.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Don't murder me.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
You come to finish the job.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Um, I fuck him.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Um...

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
For real, though?

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Yeah, I fuck him.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I grab him and I say,

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Father Tinder, in your weekend state...

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
In your weekend state...

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
I'm going to tell you this.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I never liked you.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I fucking never liked you to begin with.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I think you've been dishonest with us

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
from the fucking outset.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
So I...

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I hold him kind of tenderly,

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
like Patrick Swayze style, by the head.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
And I just... I just missionary fuck him.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
I intensify the winds

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
while this is going on.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I hear what's going on

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
down on the ground,

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
and I run into the tower

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
to stop it.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
You burst in and see a grizzly scene unfolding

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
before you.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Gnome! Gnome, you didn't do this.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Look at me.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Gnome, look at me.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
I'm looking at you.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Don't look at me.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Alright, look at the ground.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
I'm looking at you while fucking

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Father Tinder right now.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Alright, fine. I'm going to look.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Father Tinder, don't fight me.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Help me.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Help me.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
I want you to reach into the bottom part of your soul,

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
and I want you to just...

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
I already am. Please don't.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
I want you to stir up

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
the seeds of goodness.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I want you to...

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
I already am.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
No.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
He's about to be filled with my seeds of goodness.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Stop talking. Stop it.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Alright, I just... Please, please don't do this.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
You're going to...

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
It's too late. It's already happened.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
I want you to intervene

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
and pull Quark

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
off of poor Mr. Tinder.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Father, alright.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
He comes right out with a pop.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
You've rested him out.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Father Tinder, I know that

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
nothing that I can say can repair

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
the damage that has been done,

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
but at night

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I want you to look

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
for your seeds

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
of healing.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I start fucking him again.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
I kick him you off again.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I lie on top of Father Tinder

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
like a sweet...

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
No, you don't.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
You're dominated physically

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
by dignity.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Yeah, and so I flip you over

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
and I turn you on your stomach.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
I'm trying to fuck everybody right now.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I'm fucking anything that moves.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
I'm on top of you

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
just shushing in your ear

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
and I use...

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
I'm trying to fuck it.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Where's the diplomacy?

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I use diplomacy.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I go into barbarian fuck rage.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
No, I said mine first.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Fuck rage.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
You...

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
You...

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
You...

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
You...

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
You do that

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
going into a barbarian rage

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
and maybe it's the stab wound

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
you've just inflicted,

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
but you still are too weak

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
and small.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
I use...

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I use diplomacy

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
and I get

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
my face right in your tiny little

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
baby ear

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
and I say,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
look,

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
if you mess with me again

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I'm going to take your dreams.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
I'm going to eat your dreams.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I'm going to feed them.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
I cast who gives a shit.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Alright, thanks, Jeff.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I'm going to...

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
So I use diplomacy

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
to convince him

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
that I'm not to be trifled with.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Well, being in a barbarian rage

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
he can't hear reason, I'm afraid.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Okay, so I'm going to...

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I'm just going to tie...

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Is there a closet in the room or anything?

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Okay, I'm going to throw him in the closet.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
I'm right over here, in the closet.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
No, no, no, not Father Tender.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I'm going to...

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
I'm going to...

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I'm going to throw

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
quirk into the closet

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
and then I'm going...

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Put him in here with me!

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I see you have something called magic bracers.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Could I use that to keep the door closed?

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
They're just armor.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
They're like magical armor.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
The door up against the...

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
The bed up against the door.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
I say to Dignity Sarsgard, who we just met,

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
look,

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
we never liked this guy.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
There's a power shard that's been stolen, I think,

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
by somebody else. We have bigger fish to fry.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
There's no reason fighting in here.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
We should go get the person we're getting.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Also,

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Fuck Father Tender, he's an asshole.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
He's never been good to anybody.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I think he's probably one of the bad people in town.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Let's go rape this.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Whoever said that,

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
I'm going to come over there and rape you right now.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Live action,

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
fucking role-playing. I'm going to larp,

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
rape you right now.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Oh boy.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Oh yeah, rape you now.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Alright, let's have a little

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
meanwhile outside.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Yes, okay, alright. I'm running and chasing the guy.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
You're running and chasing!

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
That's how it sounds!

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
You find yourself outside

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Darmvan household.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
The Darmvan household.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
You see that one of the walls,

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
the wall nearest you has a massive hole in its

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
side. It's a strange,

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
pentagonal shape that must have been cut

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
by one of the sharpest blades in history.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
It's so clean this cut.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Massive chunks of

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
hewn stone lie in the grass

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
on the ground.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
I guess that's what grass is.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I wasn't already outside the Darmvan house.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
No, you were heading towards there.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
That was your heading.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Well, I just want to continue to chase

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
the entity. Well, it looks like that's where

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
it's gone. It's gone to the...

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Oh, the Darmvan...

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
I'm sorry, I got confused there. I apologize.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Okay, oh, I charge

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
a lot through the pentagonal...

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I got confused about Darmvan. Yeah, okay.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Sorry about that. I charge through that

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
pentagonal

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
egress. How does that sound?

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Not that ego. Well, that's wrong.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Inside... What were you doing?

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
No, you're good.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Hang back. Okay.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Inside is a scene of... Standing by.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Inside is a scene of

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
devastation. Everything is a skew

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
or exploded or cut in half.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Furniture, walls, doors,

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
all more bikes.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
These oddly clean

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
cuts.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Those things don't make sounds.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
There's things that don't make sounds.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Most things don't make sounds, I'd say.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
But these do.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
A lot of smell. I feel like

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
my position on this was clear. A lot of your favorite movies

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
would be ruined by this.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
If every clue in

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
7 was like, I'm a fat guy,

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
if it's dead, I'm a head in a box.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
What's in the box? I told you I'm a head.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Those weren't podcasts.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
They sure weren't.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
John Doe has the upper hand. I'm his upper hand!

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Oh!

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I'm up here!

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Notes after the show.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
After the show.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
So, yeah, all those things I just said.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Everything is just a strewn and cut

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
in half and into pieces. You see,

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
a splintered door appears to be one

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
of the only things not hacked to pieces.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Instead, maybe just exploded

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
or smashed somehow.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Mrs. Darvott! You hear no response.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Mrs. Darvott, I go to the door

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
and kick at it.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Inside, you see a grisly sight.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
The corpse

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
of Mrs. Darvott.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Jesus Christ!

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
In a mound of silvery-forced

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
energy!

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Really?

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Oh, yuck!

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Oh, shit!

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Oh, yuck!

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
There we go.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Spencer just took away Rob's mic.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
In cased in a mound

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
of silvery-forced energy

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
dripping with blood, her head clean

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
cut off at the neck.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
You see another small body lying on the floor,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
a pillar of force extending out of the

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
cracked ground where the head should be.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Blood spills across the floor

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
and standing in the window sill

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
as the small shadowy figure.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Here you can recognize him clearly.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
It's Spisbull, the gnome, all in black

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
ninja gear.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Spisbull, fuck!

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
You fuckers!

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
That's what you get!

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Yeah?

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Well, here's what you get. Fireball!

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Okay, so

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
he stands stock still

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
completely laughing and not able to

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
dodge, but as your fireball

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
impacts where his face should be, you see

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
a dazzling flash of white

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
light and in an instant it's gone,

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
disappeared and he looks happy.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
You see a crackle and a

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
fizz as a sort of white shimmering

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
barrier kind of shimmers out of

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
existence in front of him.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Fuck! All right.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
You fuckers!

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I use my teleport cape to teleport to behind

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:52.000
him. All right, you do that.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
And then

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I... Just give me one second.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Give me one second.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Fuck, I don't have any fucking... Make it big

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
because we're close to the end. I need

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
like a diffuse magic kind of thing.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
I don't have anything like that.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
I just...

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I'm behind him. I'm successfully behind

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
him. I'm just going to

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
try to cause fear on him.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
All right. You do that.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
And I go, hey!

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Hey!

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Hey!

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
He turns around

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
seemingly unaffected by

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
your action. Fuck!

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
He's not afraid. He... Your dice

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
are broken, man. Yeah, no, they're fucked up.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
I'll take some dice if anyone has them.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
But he

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
waves his hands in a magical manner and

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
you see a sheet, a rectangular

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
sheet of force energy start to

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
pull a lesson to existence

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
above his hand.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
It gets bigger.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
I run.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
You run. Yeah.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
He launches it directly.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Someone actually has dice. He launches it

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
directly at you and you dodge

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
out of the way.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
It smashes and slices a clean

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
cut through a wall

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
and continues going on. Chop!

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Meanwhile, outside

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
or wherever, what are you guys doing?

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
I've jumped out of the window

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
stopping, uh, raping, uh...

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Wait, did that actually happen?

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
No, I never got in the closet.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
You were physically

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
forced into it. Yeah, I

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
break out and follow

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
the trail of action towards

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
where the guy... Does he break out?

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I pushed the bed up against the

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
close door. No, you

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
break your wrist.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
So it's not just my dice.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
It's not just my dice. That was

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
a one. Yeah.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
I jumped out of the... So Dignity

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Strasgard has put me in the closet when I'm trying to help

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
my friend Sharpie out? Well, you were trying to rape someone.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Yes, that's why I put you in the closet.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Because you were being so helpful.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
But yeah. Batteries hit in the door.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
You break your wrist. You were doing shit.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Well, she's a paladin. Yeah, but she's an asshole. They're like police.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
I don't like her. Well, I mean, a police wouldn't let

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
that happen. I don't like the police.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I don't like police. Fuck the police.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
But you know what? TV dramas are about

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
them. Yeah.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
I don't watch those shows. Not about rapists.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
I don't rape people. I just fuck people.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
I use my climbing kit and my fast

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
stealth and try to follow the trail.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
You do that. You follow the trail.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I follow behind. Am I agile enough

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
to follow behind? Oh yeah, totally.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
I'm in the closet making a private

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
decree to kill Dignity Strasgard

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
under any circumstances.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I make her my own target.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Well, your promise is so powerful that

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
the door opens.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
That time I got a turn.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
I don't know what's happening today

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
with these days.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I also apologize before I left. Is that cool?

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Yeah, no. That happened.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
The guy that Jeff was fucking...

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
I yell out. We have to help Sharpie right now.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
He's alone. We have to... We're ahead

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
of you. We're doing that. Yeah, you're great.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
I love this argument that I stopped you raping

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
so I'm a bad person.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Yeah, so you guys are all converging

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
on the location.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
But who knows what will happen

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
in the future?

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
No, don't fucking fucking...

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
cliffhanger us now.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
We have to have an actual cliffhanger.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Well, it seems like a cliffhanger.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
You're kind of racing towards this deadly murderer who's...

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
But Dan is there, right? Sharpie is there.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
And he's escaping. He's running away in terror

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
last I checked. Oh, stop!

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Leave me alone!

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Oh, stop! Stop it!

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
I'm running away! Stop!

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Ow! Stop!

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Stop it! Please! Please!

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I was just running.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Please, I'm running so fast!

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
I'm running! I'm running! Stop it!

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Oh, God! Please!

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Oh, please! Stop!

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Ow! Ow!

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Ow, my ass!

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
My ass! Please, stop!

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Stop it!

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Stop it! You guys are cool.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Thank you for coming to Harmon Channel, everybody.
