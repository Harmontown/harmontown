{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:29.000\nYou can be louder than that if you want to, and now, the mayor of the city of New York.\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:35.000\nThe mayor of Harmontown, Den Harbour!\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:37.000\nThank you.\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:39.000\nYou're very, very kind.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:41.000\nThank you.\n\n00:41.000 --> 01:02.000\nYou know, it's our new home. If you're here for the third time, you see there's an evolution taking place. You should be honored to be part of it. You should be honored to be waiting for things. Why is he still looking at his phone if there's an evolution? Why can't he? Because the future hasn't happened. I don't have a fucking...\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:06.000\nYou should put your phone notes on the screen behind you.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:12.000\nWell, the people can just see... Exactly. Okay.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:20.000\nIt'll speed things up.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:22.000\nWhat have I done?\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:26.000\nI mean, this isn't really what I... Okay.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.000\nIt's a bit of a nature video right now.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:38.000\nI mean, I don't even know... You don't even know... Okay. No, this is stupid. Let me just... It doesn't matter, because I'm not going to talk that much, and then I'm going to bring up...\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:51.000\nBecause we have a show chock full of entertainment, and you guys are so lucky to be here, and you're... Yeah, you're plotting your own good fortune.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:53.000\nThat's a great thing to apply.\n\n01:53.000 --> 02:01.000\nThat's what people should apply. Like, I mean, gone are the days when you would applaud the entertainment itself.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:10.000\nNow you just applaud your own privilege and just go, like, we are lucky to be here. I was told that by the fake news.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:17.000\nSo here's the thing. All right. Let me just try to blow through some stuff that deserves more than being blown through.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:23.000\nI'm drunk. I came up drunk. I usually get drunk during the show.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:33.000\nBecause I was with my friend Joel Hodgson, who was celebrating with his Kickstarter supporters, the Mystery Science Theater accomplishment that happened on Kickstarter.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nSo many funny people attached.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:47.000\nAnd I was dragged out and whored off to no offense to whores. But I had a great time, because you're just surrounded with people.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:51.000\nIt's like, what? I got to hold court. That's what they call it. I held court.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:56.000\nTalking to people that have no choice but to stop talking when I interrupt them.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:06.000\nWell, I'm interested in this video game. Yeah, here's the thing about video games. Okay, dance talking. I thought this game is better than this one.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nWell, you're a fat, rich windbag, so I guess that's true.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:16.000\nBut we talked about so much stuff that I feel like I don't really have much show in me.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:20.000\nSo I think we'll try to get it.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nYeah, here we go.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:30.000\nSo we weren't here last week, because I went on vacation. It was my girlfriend's birthday. I went to Tulum, Mexico, the most amazing place in the world.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:38.000\nIt doesn't need my help. It's already beautiful. It's monetized. It's fine. But it's gorgeous there.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:48.000\nAnd I got high on the beach, and Cody went to get a drink, and here's what happened to me. Here's why I'm now going to be a perfect person.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:59.000\nFirst of all, it all starts with Trump, because we're all feeling the same thing, which is that we're all now living in a new space where we're like, no wrong answers.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:13.000\nWhich is not just a glib thing to say. It's true that we were living in a world where we were wondering if we were drinking too much coffee, or if we were saving enough for our retirement, or if our mortgage payments meant this, or should I have kids, or should I have kids?\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:22.000\nWhat's my favorite color? And then a rapist Nazi became president, and he did it by tweeting horrible things. He didn't do it by tricking anyone.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:28.000\nHe just went like, I'm a rapist Nazi, and everyone went, well, sometimes that's better than a woman. Yay!\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:39.000\nAnd our nightmare just marched forward. And all of the walls came down, and I'm not saying it's a good thing, and I'm not saying we needed that to happen,\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:51.000\nbut I am saying that at least we can find the positivity in that when it's like, when your paradigm shatters, you are on the verge of new epiphanies that don't have to do with how much coffee you're drinking.\n\n04:51.000 --> 05:03.000\nYou have no choice now, but to get up every morning and think about God, and whether he exists, whether he's a she, you're out of shit, you're an idiot if you're thinking about coffee.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:21.000\nThere's a fucking Nazi in the White House. So anyways, is he affecting it now? Is he affecting the thing? No, he's not. He has a problem.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:28.000\nHe can't speak. He's not a professional entertainer. He gets wound up.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:46.000\nI was on a daybed overlooking the beautiful Tulum ocean. I got high, Cody went to go get drinks, and I started doing this thing that I do when I'm happy, which is I go back over my life and I torture myself.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:58.000\nI don't think this is just a Midwest thing, but there's such a fine line between gratitude and I'm about to get cancer, because gratitude means I have it so good.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:07.000\nOh, I should really appreciate how good I have it. To me, being from Wisconsin, that is identical to saying I'm about to get cancer.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:22.000\nAnd it's also identical to saying, oh, I don't deserve this because I've been such a piece of shit. And so I'm just sitting there looking over the ocean and I'm going back over my life because my girlfriend's gone and I can't hold her hand anymore and I can't be distracted by these things that slow me down as my therapist says,\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:31.000\nrun on your engine, not on the pistons. So I start running on the pistons, and I'm going back over my life. And I'm going, well, why did Sarah Silverman fire you?\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:45.000\nWell, because you're a fucking idiot because you did this. Why did you do that with Chevy Chase? Why did you get fired from community? Why couldn't you just tow the line at Kung Fu Panda?\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:50.000\nHow many times have we all said that?\n\n06:50.000 --> 07:06.000\nWell, for most people, it's code. And so normally that's an exercise of just like, oh, you're out of the moment, you're fucked up, now you were happy, so you went back through your life and now you're torturing yourself.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:24.000\nBut I followed through on it and I was like, okay, so there's a version of me that didn't get fired, Season 4 community, there's a version of me that didn't fuck up, that knew better on the Sarah Silverman show. There's a version of me that was like, knew while working on Kung Fu Panda that no one cares about story structure.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:48.000\nThey don't know that if a panda is born entitled to win, that that makes him a villain. It doesn't matter. I made different choices. I swiped a laminate at DreamWorks the animation and went to work every day and went, you know your movie's shitty, right?\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:56.000\nAnd they kept going like, well, it's probably gonna be pretty good. And I kept going, these guys don't know what they're talking about.\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:09.000\nSo anyways, suffice to say, I have regrets. I could have serviced the fans better. Season 4 community, if I hadn't had a fucking meltdown, if I hadn't taken myself so seriously.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:19.000\nSo I'm going over all of these decisions every fucking moment, but here's what happens. So I go, okay, so there's that version of me, there's that version of me, there's that version of me.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:26.000\nSo that guy's got more money, that guy's working on a better show, that guy transitioned, he's a woman now, you're welcome.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:42.000\nLike whatever, all of the choices I could have made. And I'm like, okay, so all of you guys, what do you want? What are you going for?\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:49.000\nOne of you has a Tesla, one of you has Spielberg and your Rolodex, there was these things called Rolodexes.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:56.000\nWhat do all of you want? And then I was like, I think all of them want to be on a beach in Tulum.\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:00.000\nAnd then my girlfriend came in and I was like, holy shit, that's my girlfriend.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:07.000\nAnd I was like, whoa, and I was like, oh, it is a simulation, it's a simulation, I'm in a cutscene.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:22.000\nBecause it's a sandbox open world game, but then there's a braiding point, because it doesn't matter what you do in a good game, you come to a point where the designer said,\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:30.000\nyeah, but then you end up at this specific point where you sit on a beach and you go, this is who I am.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:39.000\nAnd the women know this is sliding doors that I'm describing. Maybe not the women in our audience.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:46.000\nBut that's what I'm saying. It was an epiphany, I don't care if you understand it.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:52.000\nThere's no way to react to an epiphany that registers to me as I nailed my epiphany.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:59.000\nYou were saying that you had so much fucking fun, you had some broke flashbacks to when life was rough.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:04.000\nWell, that's also true. Well, no, here's what you know, I am broke right now, or I was broke for a little bit.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:09.000\nLike my checking balance was so low that I was like feeling middle class.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nEw, disgusting.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:22.000\nNot one, but two of my assistants had to take me aside and warn me that my checking account balance was so low.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nDo you know how that feels?\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:28.000\nI was just trying to mitigate Steve a little bit.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:33.000\nThey don't do that unless they're worried they're not going to get paid.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nI was like, why did you take me aside?\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:42.000\nThey're like, because you were in front of the electronics guy who was like installing shit in your house and he might stop.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:48.000\nBut you know, whatever, and then a check came in. Let's not get distracted.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:56.000\nLike, here's the thing. But it's not the thing. I'm tired of saying here's the thing. I don't know the thing.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:04.000\nI, it, like, I, I'm, like, okay.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:10.000\nSo, like, like, if you, here's what I realized.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:16.000\nI started going, okay, so let's say Elon Musk is right. And it's an, I know it's not his idea, but that we're a simulation.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nSo we're playing a game.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:24.000\nOkay, so all games are based on deprivation of something like you spin a kid around.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:30.000\nOh, they don't know how to stand. Wouldn't it be funny if they pinned a tail on something?\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:36.000\nThere's no party game where you give the kid a tail and a donkey with a tail slot and you go like, well, good.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nSo you're, you're not an idiot.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:46.000\nWe, we purposely deprive people of things. We put boxes on our heads and we watch each other in turn like flounder around.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:54.000\nSo if, if, if, if life is a simulation, like, what if it's a party game? What if we're each taking turns and what if, what if, what if, knock it off?\n\n11:54.000 --> 12:02.000\nYou piece of shit. You fucking impoverished piece of garbage you.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:10.000\nWhat did I do wrong to let you in here? See, I, I lost it.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:16.000\nIn those moments when you video game, yes, thank you.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:32.000\nWhen you're sad, when you're in love, when you've been dumped, when you're angry, when you're feeling racist, when you're feeling angry, when you're, when you're too tall, when you're too short, when you're, when you're having these heightened experiences.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:43.000\nIf you imagine that it's a bit, how, how can I imagine that my crippling pain is a bit, Dan? My healthcare just got gutted.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:47.000\nWell, okay, I'll get to you in a second.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:57.000\nThere are people, if you imagine philosophically, and this is something that even an atheist can imagine without violating your atheism, because it's not an actual religion, it's just a philosophy.\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:06.000\nJust imagine a party full of people watching you with a box on your head going, look at them. Look at them go.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:09.000\nOh shit, he's onto us. He's onto it.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:15.000\nLike when you look into the eyes of your lover and you go like, this is where I, this is, this is it. This is where I'm meant to be.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:19.000\nAnd then they go like, oh, but they're also not mad at you for blowing it.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:23.000\nLike if you're just jerking off and playing Minecraft for three days, they're, they're not like, he's losing.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:29.000\nLike it's, there's no wrong way to do it. It's like one of those, like it's a party game.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:34.000\nI just wanted to get that out. I don't care. You're too dumb to get it.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.000\nThat's not true.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nIt's like Roy and Rick and Morty.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nYeah.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:43.000\nIt's exactly like that.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:47.000\nNo, I know, I know it's not a new concept or it's not something that we haven't explored already.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:55.000\nThe emotional epiphany is just the imagination that like instead of Rick watching you play Roy, what if it was like people you loved?\n\n13:55.000 --> 14:03.000\nWhat if every time I look at Spencer, like either Spencer's an AI that's like designed to pull certain behaviors out of me,\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:09.000\nor Spencer is like, represents an octopus Spencer that's like, like part of my species.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:13.000\nBut in either case, like I can look at Spencer and go like, I get it.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:21.000\nLike it's just a, we're just fucking around. And then you just, you can hear like a choir of octopus angels going, yay.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:24.000\nI don't know. I give up. I give up.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:27.000\nWe have a lot of show. I'm sorry.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nWell, you'll figure it out. Don't know.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:30.000\nNo.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:31.000\nOh yeah.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:32.000\nYeah.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nNo.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:34.000\nYes.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:42.000\nOh yeah. You deserve it because you literally went away, came back so happy, you didn't even know what the fuck to talk about.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nI had a good vacation.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nYeah.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nDon't patronize me.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:56.000\nAnd that is all right. You ain't got to feel bad about that.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nI saw get out.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:04.000\nAwesome.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nYeah.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nIt was good. It's a pretty good movie.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:11.000\nAll right. We got a lot of show solicitors.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nIt was a really good movie.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nWe were just talking about it over there while we were waiting to come out.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nSo I'm all talked out about get out.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nBut you've already seen it.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:28.000\nOur next guest created Mystery Science Theater 3000.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:35.000\nJoel Hodgson is here.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nHi Joel. Sorry.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:40.000\nHey y'all.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:45.000\nOkay. Take me up, Dan.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nSorry I took so long.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:50.000\nThat's okay. Show me what you're seeing tonight. Let's go.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nWhat? What do you mean?\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\nWhat's going on in your heart?\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:54.000\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:55.000\nOh wait. You just did that.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:56.000\nYeah, I did.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:57.000\nYou did that? Okay.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:05.000\nYeah. So, I mean, the reason we were together tonight is because you've recently resurrected MST.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:12.000\nThank you.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:13.000\nAnd you did it through crowdfunding.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nAnd what is it on Netflix?\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:16.000\nWhat's the...\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:17.000\nIt's on Netflix. Yeah.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nThere's 14 new Mystery Science theaters.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nAnd they're all just dumped out there.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nYou can just watch them.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:22.000\nThey're right. Yeah.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:23.000\nThey came out like three or four weeks ago.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:24.000\nAll right.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:25.000\nI didn't feel like...\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nI don't think any of my jokes got used.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:27.000\nYeah.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:31.000\nReptileberry Cherry Sores is yours.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:32.000\nYeah.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:33.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nI don't like my voice.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.000\nI did it like a lot of funny...\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:43.000\nI honestly deliberately didn't look at who wrote what, so I didn't want to get into this.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:46.000\nWell, as long as the fans are happy.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:47.000\nI think so.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nI meant a lot that you got involved, man.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nIt got a lot of press.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nYou were really like...\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nI don't know who would really know this.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:55.000\nI don't know if you know this.\n\n16:55.000 --> 17:02.000\nLike when I moved from Milwaukee to Los Angeles, even before I did, because we met at Comic-Con,\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:11.000\nlike when I was selling comic books, you were a person that I recognized from television\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nthat Schrab and I, therefore, when we...\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:20.360\nYou were so nice to us, treated us like equals, and therefore, when we moved to L.A., we had\n\n17:20.360 --> 17:24.400\nyour number and were hanging out with you, and you were still treating us like equals\n\n17:24.400 --> 17:31.000\nand kind of mentoring us because we were from the Midwest moving to this weird city and\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:39.000\nyou were also from the Midwest and had been there a little longer and were truly...\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:49.000\nThe stuff that you told us probably definitely helped a lot.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:53.000\nJust the idea of like, everyone out here is a fucking idiot, man.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nWait a minute, you're doing...\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nYou really got to accept that.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:02.000\nYou're like, shit, like the secret to happiness is like the day you wake up and you're like,\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:06.000\nholy shit, everyone's fucking dumb.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nYou might be embellishing there, I'm not sure.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:10.000\nYeah, I remember that lesson.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nWell, you guys were adorable, man.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:16.000\nWhen I met you and Schrab, I just, you know, had to be friends.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.000\nYou guys were great.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:21.000\nI got just as much from you guys as you got from me.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:28.000\nI want to talk about crowdfunding because you just did this thing and we did crowdfunding\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nwith Anomaly, so we worked with Kickstarter.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:35.000\nThere's actually, you have a friend here who, he's more qualified to talk about it.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nYeah.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:39.000\nCould we do a Kickstarter for me to remember his name?\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nHis name is Ivan Asquith.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nLet's bring him up.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:46.000\nBefore we do, I want to just kind of prep the audience for him.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:49.000\nHe has a mole on his forehead that's like the size of a basket.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:52.000\nIf you look at it, he flips out.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nIt's not fun.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nThat's why he got into Kickstarter.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:59.000\nBut Ivan has so much to do with the success of our Kickstarter.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:05.000\nI worked with him every day on it and he really helped me so much in understanding how to\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:11.000\nwork with a, you know, we had 50,000 backers and we gave them updates almost on a weekly\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:17.000\nlevel and he was, we collaborated together and how to talk to them and how to keep them\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:23.000\nabreast of what we were working on with MST and he's just probably, he's writing the book\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.000\non how to do this.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:25.000\nHe's an expert on it.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:31.000\nAnd he's, aside from doing our Kickstarter campaign, he's responsible for all the other\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:37.000\ntop Kickstarter campaigns like Veronica Mars and Reading Rainbow and Super Troopers 2.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\nSo he's really an expert at it.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nSo it's Ivan Asquith.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nYou want to come on up, Ivan?\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:53.000\nSee, I'm doing it Carson style where I move down and then he moves over.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nYou told them about the mole on my phone.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nYeah, sorry.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nIt's weird.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nGo ahead, just flash it.\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nYeah.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nI just think it's weird.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nThere's no mole, you idiots.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:11.000\nI mean, it unavoidably sounds like a weird keynote, like we're at some Silicon Valley company\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:16.000\nnow, like introducing you because you didn't create Batman or like design the Rainbow and\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:25.000\nReading Rainbow, but you've figured out in an emerging age, you're a piece of shit.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:30.280\nYou're a spontaneously evolved person in a new food chain that hasn't had time to become\n\n20:30.280 --> 20:35.320\nold, which is like crowdfunding, there's a tightrope here.\n\n20:35.320 --> 20:40.440\nWe did a Kickstarter with Anomalysa and I'll be the first to admit, we didn't know what\n\n20:40.440 --> 20:41.440\nwe were doing.\n\n20:41.440 --> 20:43.080\nWe fucked up in a lot of ways.\n\n20:43.080 --> 20:48.200\nYou need to update and all this stuff, but how much are you allowed to talk about the\n\n20:48.200 --> 20:53.040\nZach Braf thing, not to throw him under the bus and shit on him, but to talk about him\n\n20:53.040 --> 20:59.720\nis like a milestone of crowdfunding where the consciousness had to change.\n\n20:59.720 --> 21:00.720\nYou know what?\n\n21:00.720 --> 21:03.920\nI think it's easier to just get him to talk about his world view, like how he looks at\n\n21:03.920 --> 21:04.920\nit rather than using Zach Braf.\n\n21:04.920 --> 21:06.480\nJoel's going to take all my questions for me.\n\n21:06.480 --> 21:10.360\nYeah, but I just, I want you to do that and then you can come back around to it if you\n\n21:10.360 --> 21:11.360\nwant to.\n\n21:11.360 --> 21:13.360\nI just, I can come back around to it.\n\n21:13.360 --> 21:15.360\nI think it's the Zach Braf thing.\n\n21:15.360 --> 21:22.080\nOh no, okay, yeah, look, look, pretend I never said anything, but if I didn't say anything,\n\n21:22.080 --> 21:24.280\nit's not like you just start talking.\n\n21:24.280 --> 21:26.880\nYou have to be, yeah, something has to be said to you.\n\n21:26.880 --> 21:30.400\nHe can start talking at the drop of a hat, believe me.\n\n21:30.400 --> 21:31.400\nWhat's that?\n\n21:31.400 --> 21:32.880\nHe can talk at the drop of a hat.\n\n21:32.880 --> 21:33.880\nHe's ready to let go.\n\n21:33.880 --> 21:34.880\nLet's go ahead and get that started.\n\n21:34.880 --> 21:35.880\nThis is weird for anybody else.\n\n21:35.880 --> 21:36.880\nJust me.\n\n21:36.880 --> 21:40.280\nI guess we'll start with Zach Braf and then we'll work our way back around.\n\n21:40.280 --> 21:43.240\nNo, don't, don't, no, we're going to come around to Zach Braf.\n\n21:43.240 --> 21:45.680\nSo in like 1960s, Zach Braf was born.\n\n21:45.680 --> 21:46.680\nAwesome.\n\n21:46.680 --> 21:47.680\nI think we've covered that.\n\n21:47.680 --> 21:48.680\nNow let's just see what you do.\n\n21:48.680 --> 21:54.800\nJoel's theory is that it's okay for you to just start talking about your world view.\n\n21:54.800 --> 21:57.880\nAnd I'd like you to do that just to prove him wrong.\n\n21:57.880 --> 22:00.960\nYou'd like me to do it to prove him wrong or right?\n\n22:00.960 --> 22:02.120\nWell, no, prove him right.\n\n22:02.120 --> 22:03.120\nOh, right.\n\n22:03.120 --> 22:06.040\nMake that your goal.\n\n22:06.040 --> 22:09.800\nMy speculation is you will prove him wrong.\n\n22:09.800 --> 22:11.720\nMy world view or my crowd world view?\n\n22:11.720 --> 22:12.720\nJust start talking about your world view.\n\n22:12.720 --> 22:13.720\nExplain your world view.\n\n22:13.720 --> 22:14.720\nExplain your world view.\n\n22:14.720 --> 22:15.720\nExplain your world view.\n\n22:15.720 --> 22:18.720\nThat's how all good interviews start.\n\n22:18.720 --> 22:20.720\nSo in the beginning, there was Dan Harmon.\n\n22:20.720 --> 22:23.240\nIs that what I'm supposed to...\n\n22:23.240 --> 22:24.240\nThat's your world view?\n\n22:24.240 --> 22:25.240\nYeah.\n\n22:25.240 --> 22:26.240\nHe told me at dinner that he's...\n\n22:26.240 --> 22:28.440\nHow does that relate to the Zach Braf thing?\n\n22:28.440 --> 22:36.960\nGet the Zach Braf thing out of the way because it's really fucking up Dan.\n\n22:36.960 --> 22:38.800\nSo what was the question?\n\n22:38.800 --> 22:39.800\nWorld view.\n\n22:39.800 --> 22:40.800\nWorld view.\n\n22:40.800 --> 22:41.800\nWas Zach Braf's world view?\n\n22:41.800 --> 22:42.800\nNo.\n\n22:42.800 --> 22:44.640\nWhat's your world view?\n\n22:44.640 --> 22:45.640\nThat's a big question.\n\n22:45.640 --> 22:46.640\nIt is.\n\n22:46.640 --> 22:47.640\nOkay.\n\n22:47.640 --> 22:48.640\nWell, then let me...\n\n22:48.640 --> 22:49.640\nJoel was wrong.\n\n22:49.640 --> 22:50.640\nIs that what you want me to say?\n\n22:50.640 --> 22:51.640\nYes.\n\n22:51.640 --> 22:52.640\nThank you.\n\n22:52.640 --> 22:53.640\nJoel was wrong.\n\n22:53.640 --> 22:55.240\nI can make money so I can make something.\n\n22:55.240 --> 22:56.240\nNope.\n\n22:56.240 --> 22:57.240\nRight.\n\n22:57.240 --> 22:59.560\nSo explain the new...\n\n22:59.560 --> 23:01.520\nWhat's the nuance that we learned there?\n\n23:01.520 --> 23:02.520\nSo the...\n\n23:02.520 --> 23:06.080\nI think the big misconception on Kickstarter is that people are giving money because they\n\n23:06.080 --> 23:08.360\nwant to do somebody a favor and it's not.\n\n23:08.360 --> 23:12.400\nUsually, if it's going well, people feel like you're doing them a favor by making this thing\n\n23:12.400 --> 23:13.760\npossible that they want.\n\n23:13.760 --> 23:15.360\nLike, I think...\n\n23:15.360 --> 23:18.320\nSo I had a conversation with Zach Braf's team when they were in the middle of their\n\n23:18.320 --> 23:19.320\ncampaign.\n\n23:19.320 --> 23:21.440\nI had a much weirder conversation with like Lee's team.\n\n23:21.440 --> 23:22.440\nThat's interesting.\n\n23:22.440 --> 23:23.960\nThey're Braf's people.\n\n23:23.960 --> 23:24.960\nYeah.\n\n23:24.960 --> 23:25.960\nWell, I...\n\n23:25.960 --> 23:26.960\nIt was.\n\n23:26.960 --> 23:27.960\nWe talked about my world view.\n\n23:27.960 --> 23:28.960\nMostly.\n\n23:28.960 --> 23:31.960\nSo you can ask him what it is if you ever have him on.\n\n23:31.960 --> 23:32.960\nNo.\n\n23:32.960 --> 23:33.960\nI mean, I think the...\n\n23:33.960 --> 23:38.560\nI was telling you just before we came up that maybe his fault, maybe not, but Zach\n\n23:38.560 --> 23:41.480\nBraf's campaign is kind of like the cautionary tale for people now.\n\n23:41.480 --> 23:45.440\nNot just because he was like one of the first people to come on and he came just after Veronica\n\n23:45.440 --> 23:48.920\nMars, which was a weird moment for everybody because Kickstarter's kind of seen as this\n\n23:48.920 --> 23:52.800\nspace where like people who have no resources can suddenly make a good pitch to everybody\n\n23:52.800 --> 23:55.000\nand see if they want to give them some resources.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.520\nAnd instead, Veronica Mars is this thing owned by Warner Brothers who have a decent\n\n23:58.520 --> 24:01.840\nnumber of resources, usually.\n\n24:01.840 --> 24:06.280\nAnd people were like, why the fuck is Kickstarter asking or why is Warner Brothers asking people\n\n24:06.280 --> 24:08.720\nto give money for this thing that they could easily fund.\n\n24:08.720 --> 24:13.160\nSo right after that succeeded, Zach Braf was kind of like next out the gate and the problem\n\n24:13.160 --> 24:17.640\nwas he didn't have a very good explanation in most people's opinion for why he was asking\n\n24:17.640 --> 24:21.000\nfor money when it was really clear on like Scrub's fuck you money that he could have\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:24.880\njust funded the entire thing himself on one episode salary, or at least that was what\n\n24:24.880 --> 24:26.880\neverybody thought.\n\n24:26.880 --> 24:30.400\nAnd it got worse after he actually got the money.\n\n24:30.400 --> 24:32.360\nHe got what he was looking for.\n\n24:32.360 --> 24:36.200\nAnd then it started getting worse for him because the main argument for why he wanted\n\n24:36.200 --> 24:39.320\nmoney was he wanted creative freedom and people were like, but you have your own money, that\n\n24:39.320 --> 24:41.560\nis creative freedom.\n\n24:41.560 --> 24:46.600\nAnd he used everybody else's money, but then as I was telling you, the thing started to\n\n24:46.600 --> 24:50.440\ngo sour when the first update that he sent everybody, you know, to tell them how much\n\n24:50.440 --> 24:54.520\nhe appreciated the money that he really needed from them, was on a GoPro video shot on the\n\n24:54.520 --> 25:00.360\nback of his jet ski, with like a cool hit indie soundtrack.\n\n25:00.360 --> 25:01.440\nI'm not even kidding.\n\n25:01.440 --> 25:06.160\nAnd then the second one was a little better, it was a GoPro from the back of a motorcycle.\n\n25:06.160 --> 25:07.720\nStill not kidding.\n\n25:07.720 --> 25:12.920\nBut you know, and I think the kind of really bad moment for him was that he, I think he\n\n25:12.920 --> 25:15.840\nthought of it just like every other project he had gotten funded, he's like, I have the\n\n25:15.840 --> 25:16.840\nmoney now.\n\n25:16.840 --> 25:17.840\nNow it's my thing.\n\n25:17.840 --> 25:18.840\nI do what I want with it.\n\n25:18.840 --> 25:22.400\nAnd there wasn't necessarily a clear sense that he owed all these people who had given\n\n25:22.400 --> 25:23.400\nfive.\n\n25:23.400 --> 25:28.480\nBasically what you're doing is you're breaking up the five people who normally are paid by\n\n25:28.480 --> 25:30.040\na corporation.\n\n25:30.040 --> 25:34.640\nThese fat cats, you're breaking them up into possibly hundreds of thousands of people and\n\n25:34.640 --> 25:37.560\nthat collectively they're now your Weinstein.\n\n25:37.560 --> 25:43.120\nYou actually work for them and you owe them these updates and you owe them for granted\n\n25:43.120 --> 25:44.120\nis like the problem, right?\n\n25:44.120 --> 25:46.920\nAnd I think people don't necessarily, it's misleading to think that people mostly care\n\n25:46.920 --> 25:47.920\nabout the rewards.\n\n25:47.920 --> 25:51.720\nWhat they mostly care about is not being treated like they're a nuisance to you after they\n\n25:51.720 --> 25:53.520\nmade this thing possible.\n\n25:53.520 --> 25:59.880\nSo in his case, the like really bad moment was at Sundance when Wish I Was Here premiered\n\n25:59.880 --> 26:04.400\nand not only were his backers not given a heads up that it was going to be premiering, but\n\n26:04.400 --> 26:07.320\nI think the New York Times got a photo of one of his backers who had given a couple thousand\n\n26:07.320 --> 26:10.400\ndollars standing in front of the theater because they hadn't been able to get a ticket, holding\n\n26:10.400 --> 26:14.480\nup a cardboard sign like a homeless person saying, backer from Kickstarter will pay for\n\n26:14.480 --> 26:16.680\ntickets to my own movie.\n\n26:16.680 --> 26:17.680\nAnd yeah, it didn't go over well.\n\n26:17.680 --> 26:23.200\nI'm sure there's probably people in this audience with some, there's got to be with\n\n26:23.200 --> 26:24.200\nanomalies.\n\n26:24.200 --> 26:26.720\nYou actually took over for anomalies.\n\n26:26.720 --> 26:28.220\nWe got called to the tail.\n\n26:28.220 --> 26:30.000\nCan we talk about his world view now?\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:31.000\nOkay.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:32.000\nJust get that out of the way.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:36.040\nAll right, but I'm telling you while you were in the bathroom, I checked in on his world\n\n26:36.040 --> 26:37.040\nview.\n\n26:37.040 --> 26:38.040\nHe is so racist.\n\n26:38.040 --> 26:41.040\nBut I saw, I saw it get out.\n\n26:41.040 --> 26:43.200\nIt's one of the new racists.\n\n26:43.200 --> 26:45.800\nIt's like a nineties band.\n\n26:45.800 --> 26:46.800\nYeah.\n\n26:46.800 --> 26:53.680\nBut you, that's the interesting thing about you is you, by the way, you don't work for\n\n26:53.680 --> 26:54.680\nKickstarter.\n\n26:54.680 --> 26:55.680\nNo.\n\n26:55.680 --> 26:56.680\nYou're kind of a freelancer.\n\n26:56.680 --> 27:01.320\nThat's what's interesting to me is that, that's the healthy part of capitalism is that\n\n27:01.320 --> 27:06.640\ncrowd sourcing popped up, which is vastly superior in my opinion.\n\n27:06.640 --> 27:11.240\nWhat about ethics and karma and like, Oh, give the people their TV and movies.\n\n27:11.240 --> 27:16.720\nIt's just more efficient to say to people, Hey, I'm thinking of making a night writer\n\n27:16.720 --> 27:19.320\nreboot.\n\n27:19.320 --> 27:24.520\nI need $5 million to do what I have in mind.\n\n27:24.520 --> 27:31.520\nIf enough people and only if enough people are so interested in it that they can pledge\n\n27:31.520 --> 27:36.120\nthe money in advance to see it, then I can make it.\n\n27:36.120 --> 27:39.160\nWell, this is, I mean, that's the amazing thing about the studio system, right?\n\n27:39.160 --> 27:41.520\nLike everyone racks their brains and worries about getting fired because they're like,\n\n27:41.520 --> 27:43.160\nHow do we figure out what the audience likes?\n\n27:43.160 --> 27:46.960\nNobody knows what the audience likes, except of course the audience, if you just ask them.\n\n27:46.960 --> 27:47.960\nRight.\n\n27:47.960 --> 27:50.440\nWhich you now can with it by clicking it and, and, and, right.\n\n27:50.440 --> 27:53.160\nYou can find out whether anybody would want to show up for the thing that you want to\n\n27:53.160 --> 27:54.160\nmake.\n\n27:54.160 --> 27:55.160\nAnd if they don't, you don't have to waste your time on it.\n\n27:55.160 --> 27:58.600\nI mean, this is what you were saying, you know, before earlier this evening is it's\n\n27:58.600 --> 27:59.600\nnice.\n\n27:59.600 --> 28:02.640\nIt's not that you're begging people for money, which is what some people think it is.\n\n28:02.640 --> 28:06.560\nThat you're finding out before you put two years of your life into doing a new project,\n\n28:06.560 --> 28:08.600\nwhether anybody gives a fuck about that project.\n\n28:08.600 --> 28:09.600\nRight.\n\n28:09.600 --> 28:12.680\nIt's also good creatively too, because you have to build board a few ideas.\n\n28:12.680 --> 28:17.280\nSo I think it, it's actually helped me kind of like put forward what are the new things\n\n28:17.280 --> 28:21.240\nin MST or what, what can I show you about it?\n\n28:21.240 --> 28:23.360\nThat's kind of an innovation or a feature.\n\n28:23.360 --> 28:24.760\nWell, because we're kind of spoiled.\n\n28:24.760 --> 28:29.560\nWe do, we're coming from a world where like those are the suits and like it's easy for\n\n28:29.560 --> 28:34.280\nus to look at them as mommy and daddy and we're creative and if only I could have, if\n\n28:34.280 --> 28:39.360\nyou would just let me stop doing math homework and start doing this thing that I really want\n\n28:39.360 --> 28:41.080\nto do, then I'd do it.\n\n28:41.080 --> 28:45.400\nBut the truth is, yeah, no one wants to write an outline.\n\n28:45.400 --> 28:48.320\nNo one wants to figure out what the fuck you're going to do.\n\n28:48.320 --> 28:53.960\nAnd it's, it is that I, that's, I didn't want to throw BRAF under the bus.\n\n28:53.960 --> 28:59.520\nI wanted to use him as a, I think that was an interesting thing that we went through\n\n28:59.520 --> 29:04.360\nall those years ago where it was like, oh Kickstarter started and it was like, oh, this\n\n29:04.360 --> 29:09.120\nguy doesn't have a finger and he wants to come up with a prosthetic finger that all\n\n29:09.120 --> 29:12.920\nthe prosthetic companies won't allow him to make.\n\n29:12.920 --> 29:13.920\nCan I have money?\n\n29:13.920 --> 29:17.440\nAnd it was easy to think of it as like, oh, that's what crowdfunding is.\n\n29:17.440 --> 29:22.920\nIt's us revolting against the system and funding things that couldn't exist otherwise.\n\n29:22.920 --> 29:26.360\nAnd see, that's, that's, if you want like the closest thing I have to a worldview, because\n\n29:26.360 --> 29:27.560\nI don't have a worldview.\n\n29:27.560 --> 29:30.880\nBut I have a view on like- Just say it's your worldview and let's move on.\n\n29:30.880 --> 29:34.880\nSo my worldview is basically that like, in this space, the thing that interests me about\n\n29:34.880 --> 29:35.880\nit is not the money.\n\n29:35.880 --> 29:39.360\nLike the money's the least interesting part of crowdfunding and I get kind of like itchy\n\n29:39.360 --> 29:43.000\nand pissed off when people are like, oh, that guy's a crowdfunding guru.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:45.480\nWhich is what Joel and I makes a point of telling everybody when he introduces me to\n\n29:45.480 --> 29:46.480\nthem.\n\n29:46.480 --> 29:49.320\nBecause to me, the like, the money isn't the interesting part, the, the fact that the\n\n29:49.320 --> 29:53.760\ncrowd at large has the chance to say, this is what we want and we're tired of people ignoring\n\n29:53.760 --> 29:56.760\nus when we say we'd rather, you know, it's the, it's the Futurama meme.\n\n29:56.760 --> 29:57.760\nLike shut up and take my money.\n\n29:57.760 --> 29:58.760\nYeah.\n\n29:58.760 --> 30:03.600\nWell, because the, the, the people that, capitalism and populism are, it's not like they're removed\n\n30:03.600 --> 30:04.600\nfrom each other.\n\n30:04.600 --> 30:07.640\nIt's not like people that want to make money are constantly going, oh, what all those people\n\n30:07.640 --> 30:09.160\nwant is so disgusting to me.\n\n30:09.160 --> 30:10.160\nThey use it.\n\n30:10.160 --> 30:11.160\nThey throw it in the face of people.\n\n30:11.160 --> 30:13.960\nThey go, well, the people wanted it.\n\n30:13.960 --> 30:16.560\nSo it's like, just connect those wires, whatever.\n\n30:16.560 --> 30:19.600\nWhy am I explaining this to a nation of people that already know?\n\n30:19.600 --> 30:20.600\nAll right.\n\n30:20.600 --> 30:25.360\nSo your worldview is basically like, I know you voted for Trump.\n\n30:25.360 --> 30:32.200\nYou explained to me, it's part of being a racist.\n\n30:32.200 --> 30:34.560\nWe have cards that instruct us.\n\n30:34.560 --> 30:35.640\nWe have limited chairs.\n\n30:35.640 --> 30:39.360\nIs there anything that, because I want to bring up our actual guests.\n\n30:39.360 --> 30:47.320\nI want, I want Joel to stay because I value his, his disruption, the, the, but, but you\n\n30:47.320 --> 30:49.280\nI'm going to trade for other people.\n\n30:49.280 --> 30:53.640\nSo I, it's, it's okay.\n\n30:53.640 --> 30:54.640\nHe can take it.\n\n30:54.640 --> 30:55.640\nIt's a simulation.\n\n30:55.640 --> 30:56.640\nSo it's totally.\n\n30:56.640 --> 30:57.640\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n30:57.640 --> 30:58.640\nYeah.\n\n30:58.640 --> 30:59.640\nIt's, it's fun.\n\n30:59.640 --> 31:04.640\nYou and I will talk when you're ready for 60s in a movie.\n\n31:04.640 --> 31:05.640\nYeah.\n\n31:05.640 --> 31:06.640\nSee that.\n\n31:06.640 --> 31:07.640\nWell, okay.\n\n31:07.640 --> 31:10.000\nSo there's a thing I can't do.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:11.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:14.840\nPost Veronica Mars world, like, like I feel sometimes I feel like not getting off the\n\n31:14.840 --> 31:15.840\nstage.\n\n31:15.840 --> 31:21.000\nWell, I feel, I do feel like people go there and go, how come Dan doesn't love community?\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.040\nHow come he doesn't want to help us out?\n\n31:23.040 --> 31:28.040\nBecause if he did, wouldn't he just jump on the internet and say, who wants to pay me\n\n31:28.040 --> 31:30.520\na dollar, a ticket?\n\n31:30.520 --> 31:34.200\nI need $40 million to make the community movie and all the stuff.\n\n31:34.200 --> 31:43.040\nIt's like, I, I, the, like the, can you tell me why I'm not doing that in a way that will\n\n31:43.040 --> 31:48.200\nmake some people like feel less like I, it's like a symphony, not liking.\n\n31:48.200 --> 31:51.480\nI could guess a bunch of different reasons and I can tell you like why Joss Whedon doesn't\n\n31:51.480 --> 31:55.160\ndo it with Firefly, which is the other one besides you that people keep asking for.\n\n31:55.160 --> 31:58.400\nAnd that's the, just because the possibility is there, doesn't mean that it's necessarily\n\n31:58.400 --> 32:00.720\nwhat you want to do with the next chunk of your life, or it doesn't mean that there's\n\n32:00.720 --> 32:03.880\na story you want to tell just because people want a story told.\n\n32:03.880 --> 32:06.720\nLike if you had an idea and you had no other way to do it and you were itching to tell\n\n32:06.720 --> 32:10.320\nthat story, then maybe you'd be looking at it, but to do it just because it's what people\n\n32:10.320 --> 32:13.640\nare clamoring for doesn't mean that you're going to get excited enough to make something\n\n32:13.640 --> 32:14.640\nright.\n\n32:14.640 --> 32:16.880\nSo you're saying the reason there's not a community movie is because Dan doesn't like\n\n32:16.880 --> 32:21.680\nthe community.\n\n32:21.680 --> 32:23.600\nThat's pretty, that's, that's my worldview.\n\n32:23.600 --> 32:26.360\nI heard it's because I'm like Joss Whedon.\n\n32:26.360 --> 32:27.360\nThat's what I heard.\n\n32:27.360 --> 32:30.800\nI feel like you, your simulation is glitching.\n\n32:30.800 --> 32:34.000\nOh no.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:37.520\nI didn't raise any money to remember your name.\n\n32:37.520 --> 32:38.520\nSo that's okay.\n\n32:38.520 --> 32:39.520\nI haven't asked it.\n\n32:39.520 --> 32:41.020\nIt's still Ivan.\n\n32:41.020 --> 32:42.020\nWhat is it?\n\n32:42.020 --> 32:43.020\nIvan.\n\n32:43.020 --> 32:44.020\nOkay.\n\n32:44.020 --> 32:53.480\nWell, is there anything I want to honor you because you came up and stuck your neck out\n\n32:53.480 --> 32:54.800\nand like put up with this.\n\n32:54.800 --> 33:00.520\nSo is there anything from your worldview that like you want to plug anything, tip anybody\n\n33:00.520 --> 33:04.800\noff to any, any like fucking projects you're cooking up?\n\n33:04.800 --> 33:09.720\nIs there a Knight Rider series that needs people to click on or any projects?\n\n33:09.720 --> 33:14.600\nUh, I mean, I'm supposed to talk to Justin about something.\n\n33:14.600 --> 33:15.600\nReally?\n\n33:15.600 --> 33:16.600\nOh shit.\n\n33:16.600 --> 33:17.600\nMaybe.\n\n33:17.600 --> 33:21.720\nAbout the fact that I'm always out of the loop on Justin projects.\n\n33:21.720 --> 33:24.360\nI'm, I'm, no comment.\n\n33:24.360 --> 33:34.200\nWhat are you supposed to talk about Justin about, what is he, what is he up to now?\n\n33:34.200 --> 33:35.880\nFirst you hold back on the Zach Braff.\n\n33:35.880 --> 33:39.320\nNow you're holding back on Justin.\n\n33:39.320 --> 33:42.400\nWe want to know what is Rick and where are you being deprived of that it needs to be\n\n33:42.400 --> 33:43.400\ncrowdfunded.\n\n33:43.400 --> 33:45.880\nIt's so, it's a fucking virtual reality project.\n\n33:45.880 --> 33:46.880\nIsn't it?\n\n33:46.880 --> 33:47.880\nHe's obsessed.\n\n33:47.880 --> 33:51.760\nI, I genuinely don't know what he wants to talk about.\n\n33:51.760 --> 33:56.280\nHe might just want to introduce you to like a porn star or something.\n\n33:56.280 --> 33:57.280\nIf there's money in it.\n\n33:57.280 --> 33:58.280\nYeah.\n\n33:58.280 --> 33:59.280\nYeah.\n\n33:59.280 --> 34:00.280\nYou got to come over to my house.\n\n34:00.280 --> 34:06.800\nIt's going to be great.\n\n34:06.800 --> 34:09.040\nThose pickups never end well.\n\n34:09.040 --> 34:11.160\nI never get invited anymore.\n\n34:11.160 --> 34:13.480\nOh, it's all right.\n\n34:13.480 --> 34:15.480\nThere'll still be a season four.\n\n34:15.480 --> 34:17.160\nWe'll figure it out.\n\n34:17.160 --> 34:18.160\nAll right.\n\n34:18.160 --> 34:21.760\nWell, so let's, let's, let's thank Ivan for, for sharing.\n\n34:21.760 --> 34:27.320\nI've been asked with, okay.\n\n34:27.320 --> 34:28.320\nOkay.\n\n34:28.320 --> 34:33.680\nAnd let's, let's, let's, let's, let's immediately now because I, I've eaten into their time.\n\n34:33.680 --> 34:37.880\nLet's, let's, let's bring up Robert Evans and Magenta Vaughn and we'll tell you.\n\n34:37.880 --> 34:47.640\nAll right, sorry you guys, I don't know what, I guess I, I apologize too much.\n\n34:47.640 --> 34:48.640\nYeah.\n\n34:48.640 --> 34:51.360\nFor all you know, it's part of the format of the show for me to not bring up that one.\n\n34:51.360 --> 34:52.360\nUm, all right.\n\n34:52.360 --> 34:55.760\nSo first let's just, I'd like you to explain your worldview.\n\n34:55.760 --> 35:00.480\nUh, it's shit except for the stuff that's not, and that stuff's all right.\n\n35:00.480 --> 35:03.360\nThat's what I think sometimes.\n\n35:03.360 --> 35:08.600\nWe weren't talking about upstairs just to skip around because I'm a bad interviewer.\n\n35:08.600 --> 35:09.800\nYou just came back from the Middle East.\n\n35:09.800 --> 35:10.800\nYou were in Iraq specifically?\n\n35:10.800 --> 35:11.800\nIraq and Turkey.\n\n35:11.800 --> 35:12.800\nYeah.\n\n35:12.800 --> 35:13.800\nBut mostly Iraq.\n\n35:13.800 --> 35:16.240\nUh, so really right in the Middle East.\n\n35:16.240 --> 35:17.240\nYeah.\n\n35:17.240 --> 35:18.240\nRight in the middle.\n\n35:18.240 --> 35:20.880\nWe had to cross the, the Tigris to get where we were going.\n\n35:20.880 --> 35:24.560\nUm, the part, when the Middle East isn't prepared properly and it's the first place\n\n35:24.560 --> 35:26.080\nthat's like cold.\n\n35:26.080 --> 35:28.080\nUm, okay.\n\n35:28.080 --> 35:33.200\nUm, but you were talking about like Rick and Morty fans.\n\n35:33.200 --> 35:34.200\nYeah.\n\n35:34.200 --> 35:35.200\nIn Iraq?\n\n35:35.200 --> 35:36.200\nWas it Iraq?\n\n35:36.200 --> 35:37.200\nYeah.\n\n35:37.200 --> 35:38.200\nIt was Iraq.\n\n35:38.200 --> 35:39.200\nUm, yeah.\n\n35:39.200 --> 35:41.320\nAnd we were talking about the fact that somebody, somebody quoted you, you take it so that someone's\n\n35:41.320 --> 35:42.320\ntalking other than me.\n\n35:42.320 --> 35:43.320\nYeah.\n\n35:43.320 --> 35:45.760\nSo we, uh, we've got a couple of friends out there and one of them is this guy I R who's\n\n35:45.760 --> 35:51.120\nlike 27 years old and his day job is taking journalists from Erbil, which is a safe city\n\n35:51.120 --> 35:55.400\nin Northern Iraq to Mosul, which is the city where all the ISIS guys are.\n\n35:55.400 --> 35:59.080\nSo like one day he'll be in college studying for his business degree and the next day he'll\n\n35:59.080 --> 36:02.560\nbe like taking sniper fire with the guys from vice or the guys from the New Yorker or the\n\n36:02.560 --> 36:06.360\nguys from the New York times or the Guardian, like he's worked with everybody that's done\n\n36:06.360 --> 36:07.360\nanything out there.\n\n36:07.360 --> 36:08.360\nUm, and so.\n\n36:08.360 --> 36:09.360\nFake news.\n\n36:09.360 --> 36:10.360\nWhat's that?\n\n36:10.360 --> 36:11.360\nFake news.\n\n36:11.360 --> 36:12.360\nDefinitely.\n\n36:12.360 --> 36:13.360\nSounds like fake news.\n\n36:13.360 --> 36:14.360\nYeah.\n\n36:14.360 --> 36:15.360\nOkay.\n\n36:15.360 --> 36:16.360\nHe's where the fake news comes from.\n\n36:16.360 --> 36:17.360\nAll right.\n\n36:17.360 --> 36:18.360\nGotcha.\n\n36:18.360 --> 36:21.400\nSo this guy, like he's a, he's a perfectly normal dude.\n\n36:21.400 --> 36:25.240\nWe'll talk about the Simpsons or whatever, just like Facebook, like he loves, like he,\n\n36:25.240 --> 36:29.920\nhe, he, he shot a mannequin challenge video with members of the Iraqi army, like, well,\n\n36:29.920 --> 36:31.880\nthey were, while they were under sniper fire.\n\n36:31.880 --> 36:34.800\nLike he went up to these guys and was like, I want, there's this thing called the mannequin\n\n36:34.800 --> 36:37.120\nchallenge and I want to do it with you.\n\n36:37.120 --> 36:39.480\nAnd they were like, no, that's the dumbest idea in the world.\n\n36:39.480 --> 36:42.080\nBut then he described it and they're like, oh, well, that's what we're supposed to do\n\n36:42.080 --> 36:44.440\nunder sniper fire.\n\n36:44.440 --> 36:45.440\nIt's decidedly not.\n\n36:45.440 --> 36:46.440\nOh, okay.\n\n36:46.440 --> 36:47.440\nCause they're like this.\n\n36:47.440 --> 36:48.440\nYeah.\n\n36:48.440 --> 36:49.440\nThey're, they're standing.\n\n36:49.440 --> 36:50.440\nIt was dangerous.\n\n36:50.440 --> 36:51.440\nOh God.\n\n36:51.440 --> 36:52.440\nThat's awful.\n\n36:52.440 --> 36:56.640\nCould you imagine anything more horrible than a mannequin challenge video where midway\n\n36:56.640 --> 36:57.640\nthrough it?\n\n36:57.640 --> 36:58.640\nI mean, we've got it.\n\n36:58.640 --> 36:59.960\nWe can show it later if you want.\n\n36:59.960 --> 37:00.960\nOkay.\n\n37:00.960 --> 37:01.960\nIt ends horribly.\n\n37:01.960 --> 37:02.960\nNo.\n\n37:02.960 --> 37:03.960\nThat one doesn't end horribly.\n\n37:03.960 --> 37:04.960\nNo.\n\n37:04.960 --> 37:05.960\nPlease God.\n\n37:05.960 --> 37:06.960\nI don't want to see this.\n\n37:06.960 --> 37:10.640\nWe're going to, we're going to delineate a visual chapter of the show for our audio\n\n37:10.640 --> 37:15.960\nonly participants so that we can either edit it out or they can plug their eyes.\n\n37:15.960 --> 37:20.600\nBut, but yeah, I just, I don't want to pepper the show with a, with a ton of visuals, but,\n\n37:20.600 --> 37:26.120\nbut, uh, so all right, well, anyways, but just to finish that random thought, when we\n\n37:26.120 --> 37:30.120\nleave, I give this guy like my copies of Rick and Morty seasons one and two and he sends\n\n37:30.120 --> 37:33.600\nme like a Facebook message the day we get back and he's like, this is the show I've\n\n37:33.600 --> 37:34.600\nbeen waiting for all my life.\n\n37:34.600 --> 37:36.640\nThis is the best thing I've ever watched.\n\n37:36.640 --> 37:39.920\nAnd he posts like a Rick meme to his Facebook, like Rick looking sad because he had like\n\n37:39.920 --> 37:42.240\na tough day at school like the next day.\n\n37:42.240 --> 37:45.520\nAnd one of his friends who we'd met on the trip who also leads journalists up to the\n\n37:45.520 --> 37:48.640\nfront line immediately posted, nobody belongs anywhere.\n\n37:48.640 --> 37:51.800\nUh, you know, that whole quote, like everyone's going to die.\n\n37:51.800 --> 37:52.800\nLet's go watch TV.\n\n37:52.800 --> 37:53.800\nRight.\n\n37:53.800 --> 37:57.480\nBecause if you, if you've grown up as a kid and Iraq your entire life, like you're\n\n37:57.480 --> 38:01.120\ntuned into the same global media cultures, everybody in this room, like we've all watched\n\n38:01.120 --> 38:04.160\ntime cop and commando and whatever in community.\n\n38:04.160 --> 38:07.600\nBut like also sometimes your friends explode because that's just like the nature of the\n\n38:07.600 --> 38:08.600\nworld you live in.\n\n38:08.600 --> 38:10.760\nLike I are, we'd be talking with him about like bullshit.\n\n38:10.760 --> 38:13.320\nAnd then randomly he'd mention, Oh, sorry, my suspension's messed up.\n\n38:13.320 --> 38:17.280\nThere was a car bomb and I got stuck in traffic and it blew up next to my car.\n\n38:17.280 --> 38:22.280\nSo the suspension's all fucked like, so they're, they're perfectly set up for that kind of\n\n38:22.280 --> 38:26.360\nhumor where it's like the, the, the darkness makes it feel right to them.\n\n38:26.360 --> 38:27.360\nLike they don't.\n\n38:27.360 --> 38:28.360\nI heard that.\n\n38:28.360 --> 38:29.360\nI thought that was it.\n\n38:29.360 --> 38:35.320\nCause that reminded me of a thing my therapist was talking about, which was, uh, uh, she\n\n38:35.320 --> 38:41.720\nwatched something, I think it was documentary about women in war, um, and not, not meaning\n\n38:41.720 --> 38:47.200\nwomen that put on a Kevlar vest and go out there like Vasquez and aliens, but, uh, uh,\n\n38:47.200 --> 38:52.720\nin traditional cultures where the men go away and then the boys go away and then, and meanwhile\n\n38:52.720 --> 39:01.800\nthere's just, uh, rubble and, uh, need to continue as if life will continue after whatever's\n\n39:01.800 --> 39:03.300\ngoing on.\n\n39:03.300 --> 39:11.560\nAnd the psychological capacity of nurturers, uh, to be like, I don't fucking care about\n\n39:11.560 --> 39:12.980\nthis war.\n\n39:12.980 --> 39:18.640\nThis kid needs to learn the alphabet and he's not going to learn it or she, uh, if it's\n\n39:18.640 --> 39:28.240\nthe wrong place to be inclusive, uh, they're not going to learn it, uh, uh, if I'm so passionate\n\n39:28.240 --> 39:30.760\nabout the God damn struggle that's going on.\n\n39:30.760 --> 39:33.600\nIt's like, it, it, there's something about that.\n\n39:33.600 --> 39:37.240\nI guess I related that to the idea that when you said that you said there's, if there's\n\n39:37.240 --> 39:41.560\na kid somewhere where everything's blowing up and they're quoting that line from Rick\n\n39:41.560 --> 39:48.400\nand Morty, which believe me, when I write Rick and Morty and I like, I go to that nihilistic\n\n39:48.400 --> 39:55.760\nplace, I do it with difficulty because I feel like first world kid, I feel like I'm part\n\n39:55.760 --> 40:02.080\nof the problem and not the solution sometimes, but it's like, because it's like kids, kids,\n\n40:02.080 --> 40:05.320\nkids already feel like life means nothing.\n\n40:05.320 --> 40:07.920\nLike that's called being a kid.\n\n40:07.920 --> 40:14.320\nAnd so if your favorite cartoon is also saying life means nothing, I mean, but the alternative\n\n40:14.320 --> 40:16.480\nis to say life means something and then I'd be lying.\n\n40:16.480 --> 40:20.560\nI can't, but it's, but, but it's just like, like, like, so that line where, where Morty\n\n40:20.560 --> 40:26.000\nsays that, I remember, I remember typing that and going like, this is like the idea that\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:30.920\nyou're selling consumerism, basically you're saying like, life means nothing comes down\n\n40:30.920 --> 40:32.360\nand watch TV.\n\n40:32.360 --> 40:36.720\nI was like, ah, this feels a little shitty, but at the same time it just feels, it's,\n\n40:36.720 --> 40:40.320\nit's like he's, he's being a good little brother is what she needs to hear, otherwise\n\n40:40.320 --> 40:43.760\nshe's going to leave home.\n\n40:43.760 --> 40:50.880\nBut hearing that somebody who is, whose life is being torn apart would cat, would, would\n\n40:50.880 --> 40:52.760\nlatch onto that line.\n\n40:52.760 --> 40:56.360\nThen I go, oh, nihilism is like the baseline.\n\n40:56.360 --> 40:58.760\nThe truth is life means nothing.\n\n40:58.760 --> 41:02.720\nIf you, if you're wiping your ass with dollar bills and you say life means nothing, you're\n\n41:02.720 --> 41:04.840\nbeing a piece of shit.\n\n41:04.840 --> 41:08.560\nAnd if you're born in a bomb crater and you say life means nothing, you're actually like\n\n41:08.560 --> 41:11.640\ncentering yourself and getting through shit.\n\n41:11.640 --> 41:14.440\nLike it's not, it's not nihilism if you live with that.\n\n41:14.440 --> 41:18.160\nLike if it's a real possibility that like someone you know could die any day just because\n\n41:18.160 --> 41:21.720\nlike things explode where you live and that's a normal part of life or if you know you're\n\n41:21.720 --> 41:24.120\ngoing to get shot at when you get up in the morning.\n\n41:24.120 --> 41:28.560\nLike it's not nihilism to say, yeah, anyone can die at any point in time, let's enjoy\n\n41:28.560 --> 41:33.040\nourselves for this 22 minutes that we have that we know we're not getting shot at probably\n\n41:33.040 --> 41:34.040\nright now.\n\n41:34.040 --> 41:35.040\nLike that's not nihilistic.\n\n41:35.040 --> 41:39.400\nThat's like, that's like one of the most liberating things in the world is to be like, well I\n\n41:39.400 --> 41:42.960\nknow that right now when I'm watching TV I'm probably pretty safe, I'm going to go out\n\n41:42.960 --> 41:45.760\ntomorrow and maybe die, but that's fucking in the morning.\n\n41:45.760 --> 41:53.640\nYeah, I mean, I really am drunk and I, look, the thing is, what's that?\n\n41:53.640 --> 41:57.200\nOh, you're such a, what does she have to say?\n\n41:57.200 --> 42:05.520\nWe'll be right with you sir, in the meantime, enjoy your poppers.\n\n42:05.520 --> 42:06.520\nThere's poppers?\n\n42:06.520 --> 42:07.520\nThere's poppers tonight.\n\n42:07.520 --> 42:08.520\nSon of a bitch.\n\n42:08.520 --> 42:12.960\nThere's a lot of things I do wrong, among them is also I don't introduce people, I don't\n\n42:12.960 --> 42:19.120\ntell them what's going on, it's like, I, no, it's okay.\n\n42:19.120 --> 42:24.520\nYour cookie's in the mail for caring about her.\n\n42:24.520 --> 42:31.280\nMagenta, what's your, so you guys, like let's get back to the top of the interview and what\n\n42:31.280 --> 42:35.760\nI should say, bypassing your worldview.\n\n42:35.760 --> 42:40.240\nYou guys just came back from the Middle East, where are you the tippy typey, you tap the\n\n42:40.240 --> 42:43.440\nthings and are you photographing things?\n\n42:43.440 --> 42:48.480\nAnd so what, how, are you guys young enough for me to ask how old you are?\n\n42:48.480 --> 42:49.480\n29.\n\n42:49.480 --> 42:52.280\nI'm a millennial.\n\n42:52.280 --> 42:57.000\nEverybody under 40 is now, yeah, because you hear me shitting on millennials all the\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:58.000\ntime.\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:00.920\nI just found out I'm one.\n\n43:00.920 --> 43:02.320\nCan I ask how old you are?\n\n43:02.320 --> 43:03.320\n27.\n\n43:03.320 --> 43:04.320\n27 and 29.\n\n43:04.320 --> 43:05.320\nYeah.\n\n43:05.320 --> 43:16.800\nI, like, so you guys, in the interest of journalism, you go to this place that, like, if you guys\n\n43:16.800 --> 43:26.360\nwere, knock on wood to have something horrible happen to you, like, the worst people in the\n\n43:26.360 --> 43:30.560\nworld would be the ones to say, well, why'd they go over there?\n\n43:30.560 --> 43:35.960\nAnd the best people in the world would only say, oh, they went over there because they\n\n43:35.960 --> 43:37.960\nlove their job.\n\n43:37.960 --> 43:44.320\nLike, nobody would say, well, good thing they went over there, like, so I want to know from\n\n43:44.320 --> 43:51.000\nyou guys, like, because you, you're the verbal one, you're the, not the pigeonhole you guys,\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.120\nbut you're taking pictures, you're writing stuff.\n\n43:53.120 --> 43:54.440\nWe switch now.\n\n43:54.440 --> 43:59.520\nYou're both journalists, you're providing, you're providing an otherwise ignorant world\n\n43:59.520 --> 44:03.840\nwith an eye tore into a part that they otherwise wouldn't see.\n\n44:03.840 --> 44:06.240\nSo why are you doing that?\n\n44:06.240 --> 44:12.800\nI mean, we went over there for the first time because I'd read about this place called Kurdistan,\n\n44:12.800 --> 44:16.680\nwhich is a region in northern Iraq that, if you read the news stories about it, it's supposed\n\n44:16.680 --> 44:21.200\nto be really nice, really stable, really safe, really advanced attitudes for the region towards\n\n44:21.200 --> 44:22.200\nwomen.\n\n44:22.200 --> 44:26.400\nLike, one of the rules is in their parliament, 30% of the seats have to be held by women,\n\n44:26.400 --> 44:30.440\nwhich is twice the representation of women in Congress in the United States, just as\n\n44:30.440 --> 44:32.080\na heads up.\n\n44:32.080 --> 44:35.200\nIt sounds like they're the Dan Harmon of Middle Eastern countries.\n\n44:35.200 --> 44:37.840\nThat's, that's literally on their flag.\n\n44:37.840 --> 44:39.760\nIt's a confusing flag.\n\n44:39.760 --> 44:46.400\nI also force myself to include a certain amount of women in everything I do.\n\n44:46.400 --> 44:47.400\nWhat per se.\n\n44:47.400 --> 44:51.000\nYou're welcome.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:55.840\nSo it was one of those, like, we'd read all these reports, but they're also, like, you\n\n44:55.840 --> 44:59.280\ndon't, you never know what's true about that, especially since, like, there's a lot of people\n\n44:59.280 --> 45:02.720\non the, on the far right who have a lot of investment in Kurdistan, like the myth of\n\n45:02.720 --> 45:05.960\nthat being real and it actually being a really nice place because it's the one era where,\n\n45:05.960 --> 45:09.520\nlike, George Bush's plan worked out.\n\n45:09.520 --> 45:10.520\nSo I didn't know what it was.\n\n45:10.520 --> 45:12.320\nWhat exactly is that real quick?\n\n45:12.320 --> 45:16.560\nDemocracy in Iraq, a safe, nice place where people get to vote and things don't explode\n\n45:16.560 --> 45:17.560\nas much.\n\n45:17.560 --> 45:19.760\nAnd what are the, what are the industries that people are in?\n\n45:19.760 --> 45:20.760\nOil.\n\n45:20.760 --> 45:21.760\nOkay.\n\n45:21.760 --> 45:22.760\nAlmost entirely oil.\n\n45:22.760 --> 45:25.640\nIt's super corrupt up there, the government, which might not be a great thing for when\n\n45:25.640 --> 45:27.640\nI go back to say, but, like, it's, it's,\n\n45:27.640 --> 45:28.640\nOh, they listen.\n\n45:28.640 --> 45:29.640\nThey listen to this show.\n\n45:29.640 --> 45:30.640\nYeah.\n\n45:30.640 --> 45:31.640\nKurdistan.\n\n45:31.640 --> 45:32.640\nIt's a surprising number.\n\n45:32.640 --> 45:33.640\nAll right.\n\n45:33.640 --> 45:36.520\nSo I want to make sure I don't lose something, though, because there's a point.\n\n45:36.520 --> 45:42.280\nI want to go, I want to rewind your play deck to the point before you become the kind of\n\n45:42.280 --> 45:45.760\nperson that wants to go to the Middle East as a journalist.\n\n45:45.760 --> 45:50.680\nAnd I want to, like, I want to frame forward from where you go from being someone that\n\n45:50.680 --> 45:55.120\nhadn't considered that at all to being somebody that was like, I'm going to go over there.\n\n45:55.120 --> 46:00.600\nBecause it's probably one of the easiest decisions in the world for even the smartest, most liberal\n\n46:00.600 --> 46:03.280\npeople to be like, yeah, but then also I don't go over there.\n\n46:03.280 --> 46:05.080\nCan I, can I butt in?\n\n46:05.080 --> 46:08.760\nIt's kind of like, why would you eat meat?\n\n46:08.760 --> 46:14.720\nLike you should probably kill an animal and like know about what's going on in your side\n\n46:14.720 --> 46:15.720\nof your body.\n\n46:15.720 --> 46:20.760\nSo like if millions of other people are living over there, why wouldn't you go there?\n\n46:20.760 --> 46:23.760\nWait, wait, I want to make sure I know the parallel you're drawing.\n\n46:23.760 --> 46:29.480\nBecause it's like, like, like why, I would eat meat because it's the easiest thing to\n\n46:29.480 --> 46:30.480\ndo.\n\n46:30.480 --> 46:31.480\nNo, it's not.\n\n46:31.480 --> 46:32.480\nAlso, can you eat the mic just a bit?\n\n46:32.480 --> 46:33.480\nSorry.\n\n46:33.480 --> 46:34.480\nOh yeah, eat the mic.\n\n46:34.480 --> 46:35.480\nDefinitely eat the mic.\n\n46:35.480 --> 46:36.480\nIt's not me.\n\n46:36.480 --> 46:40.000\nI think you should be willing to do whatever, whatever you're partaking in.\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:44.120\nAnd if you're in the society, buying things as you are, living as you are, contributing\n\n46:44.120 --> 46:48.040\nto the whole world being the way it is, and you're fine with millions of other people\n\n46:48.040 --> 46:51.160\ndying and living through that, like why don't you go check it out, because they're doing\n\n46:51.160 --> 46:52.160\nit.\n\n46:52.160 --> 46:53.160\nRight.\n\n46:53.160 --> 46:57.640\nI, I, I, I know why it's a good thing to do.\n\n46:57.640 --> 47:02.880\nI don't, I, I'm talking to the human beings though, like, like, where do you get to the\n\n47:02.880 --> 47:07.640\npoint where you find the ability to do it, because I know I shouldn't be eating meat.\n\n47:07.640 --> 47:12.520\nI think I'd be happier if I didn't eat meat, but then I, then Tuesday turns into Wednesday\n\n47:12.520 --> 47:13.520\nand Thursday.\n\n47:13.520 --> 47:16.880\nBut like, I should kill an animal and try it and just like, see how it makes you feel\n\n47:16.880 --> 47:17.880\nabout me.\n\n47:17.880 --> 47:18.880\nRight.\n\n47:18.880 --> 47:19.880\nI should, I should, I should.\n\n47:19.880 --> 47:22.480\nThe question also is what makes you brave?\n\n47:22.480 --> 47:23.480\nRight.\n\n47:23.480 --> 47:24.480\nExactly.\n\n47:24.480 --> 47:25.480\nThat's what I'm trying to get at.\n\n47:25.480 --> 47:28.280\nWe all feel like we have a responsibility, but your responsibility is great in that you\n\n47:28.280 --> 47:31.360\nput yourself in danger and come back and tell stories.\n\n47:31.360 --> 47:33.480\nWhat exactly made you do that?\n\n47:33.480 --> 47:34.480\nWhat makes you do that?\n\n47:34.480 --> 47:35.480\nBravery.\n\n47:35.480 --> 47:36.480\nYes.\n\n47:36.480 --> 47:39.480\nIt's pretty fucking brave to go to some place where people are doing bombs and shit.\n\n47:39.480 --> 47:43.200\nYou're just like in an airport and you're like buying your pretzel and drinking beer\n\n47:43.200 --> 47:46.920\nand you like walk onto the runway and you're like getting drunk in the airplane and then\n\n47:46.920 --> 47:52.000\nyou're with other humans and there's dangerous things going around, but like, it's just,\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:55.000\nyou're moving physically to a different part of the world.\n\n47:55.000 --> 48:00.120\nWait, Magenta, sorry, just put, put, always, I want to make sure people hear you.\n\n48:00.120 --> 48:01.120\nOkay.\n\n48:01.120 --> 48:02.120\nSorry.\n\n48:02.120 --> 48:09.200\nBut that's, this is the thing, it's like, can you remember a version of you that didn't\n\n48:09.200 --> 48:14.400\nhave that altruism that wasn't functioning on that level?\n\n48:14.400 --> 48:19.240\nCan you remember a version of you that was selfish and lazy and did what was easy?\n\n48:19.240 --> 48:20.840\nThat's the only version of me.\n\n48:20.840 --> 48:21.840\nWhat changed?\n\n48:21.840 --> 48:23.280\nDid you see something?\n\n48:23.280 --> 48:24.280\nDid you feel something?\n\n48:24.280 --> 48:26.440\nDid you have a dialogue with yourself?\n\n48:26.440 --> 48:28.640\nNo pressure.\n\n48:28.640 --> 48:36.360\nBut I think the reason is because like, if I could just, I'll just babble and derail.\n\n48:36.360 --> 48:37.360\nThis is the thing.\n\n48:37.360 --> 48:40.960\nLike, it is like, there's all these people in the world and then you go like, oh, there's\n\n48:40.960 --> 48:43.360\none of those, there's one of those war journalists.\n\n48:43.360 --> 48:47.520\nOh, they got the vest, they got the camera.\n\n48:47.520 --> 48:52.840\nI just came back from Kublaka, Blaka, oh, what happened there?\n\n48:52.840 --> 48:56.520\nOh, well, there was this guy and then the wheel came off and then there's like, but\n\n48:56.520 --> 48:59.680\nthen we didn't know, we had to get blindfolded, all this stuff.\n\n48:59.680 --> 49:02.400\nAnd the rest of us are thinking deep down inside, we're going like, well, I'll take\n\n49:02.400 --> 49:06.040\nthat information and I'll put it on my coffee mug and I'll use it to bully someone at work\n\n49:06.040 --> 49:09.880\ntomorrow because I want them to vote for someone instead of someone.\n\n49:09.880 --> 49:17.320\nBut deep, deep, deep, deep down, although none of us are soldiers, you guys, you guys\n\n49:17.320 --> 49:25.120\ngo there figuratively and literally, it's truly a risk and it's truly more importantly\n\n49:25.120 --> 49:29.680\na risk that no one would even, that's what I was saying before.\n\n49:29.680 --> 49:36.720\nAnd so I'm just, okay, one more, let me just, the valuable thing about me nitpicking this\n\n49:36.720 --> 49:45.160\nis precisely because if you guys aren't that different from us, if you weren't born special\n\n49:45.160 --> 49:51.400\nand brave, there might be something, there might be something we could, we could think\n\n49:51.400 --> 49:55.200\nwith or maybe some path we could walk down where we end up like acting instead of thinking.\n\n49:55.200 --> 49:57.320\nSo that's why I'm asking.\n\n49:57.320 --> 50:02.880\nI mean, I can say the first war zone we ever reported from was in Eastern Ukraine, it was\n\n50:02.880 --> 50:04.040\nthis town called Avdivka.\n\n50:04.040 --> 50:06.000\nOkay, but before that, no, I'm kidding.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.720\nWe have what I'm getting to, Dan.\n\n50:08.720 --> 50:15.400\nWe want to know, did you get into a fight and it may, what made you, what made you suddenly\n\n50:15.400 --> 50:18.920\nsay, I'm going to do a little bit more than the average person when it comes to getting\n\n50:18.920 --> 50:19.920\nfacts.\n\n50:19.920 --> 50:23.440\nI didn't like cleaning up dead animals and cockroaches and mobile homes.\n\n50:23.440 --> 50:24.760\nThere we go.\n\n50:24.760 --> 50:31.520\nWhen you did it though, did you do it like as a journalist or you're like, I'm standing\n\n50:31.520 --> 50:36.280\nover three dead bodies, roaches, the carnage here right now.\n\n50:36.280 --> 50:38.640\nYou can say, Robert, I didn't mean to.\n\n50:38.640 --> 50:41.640\nI mean, I, like, I get, there's two parts to that question.\n\n50:41.640 --> 50:46.680\nOne of them is that like it's fun, like up until someone gets horrifically injured, it's\n\n50:46.680 --> 50:50.600\na lot of fun out there, like you're moving around, everything's going fast, you're writing\n\n50:50.600 --> 50:54.240\naround in cool vehicles, everyone's really friendly, everything's super funny.\n\n50:54.240 --> 50:59.720\nLike anything that happens in a war zone, like it's hilarious to everybody who's there.\n\n50:59.720 --> 51:03.480\nLike it's just like, at one point we're at this area where like some ISIS snipers had\n\n51:03.480 --> 51:06.680\njust been shooting and they've been shooting rockets back at them and this guy is like\n\n51:06.680 --> 51:10.240\ntrying to load a big rocket and he leans over and all the grenades fall off of his vest\n\n51:10.240 --> 51:14.920\nand down the berm and he's like, it's like, it was like a fucking like slapstick comedy\n\n51:14.920 --> 51:19.400\nmoment as he's like going for all these grenades and he sees we're filming him and he's like,\n\n51:19.400 --> 51:22.400\nyou could tell the guy felt so bad that we caught that moment where he looked like a\n\n51:22.400 --> 51:24.920\nbadass and then he drops his grenades on camera.\n\n51:24.920 --> 51:28.760\nThis brings up an interesting, my mind is scrambling because I have two big questions\n\n51:28.760 --> 51:35.840\noff of that to ask which is, but I think the one I don't want to forget is when, so you're\n\n51:35.840 --> 51:39.920\ntraveling with military people always.\n\n51:39.920 --> 51:41.560\nNo, no, no.\n\n51:41.560 --> 51:42.720\nThey're up at the front.\n\n51:42.720 --> 51:47.080\nYou usually, so all of the war journalism, whether it's vice or the New York Times or\n\n51:47.080 --> 51:50.920\nthe New Yorker or the Guardian or the BBC, anytime you see this report from Iraq, this\n\n51:50.920 --> 51:56.880\nreport from Syria, those guys got in a car with some local person whose primary qualification\n\n51:56.880 --> 52:01.720\nwas speaks good English and knows someone involved in the military in some way there\n\n52:01.720 --> 52:03.480\nand that person led them around.\n\n52:03.480 --> 52:08.360\nThey're called fixers and it's like a little cottage economy that pops up all around.\n\n52:08.360 --> 52:11.840\nI should probably plug, we're raising money for a documentary about some of these guys\n\n52:11.840 --> 52:12.840\ncalled the fixers.\n\n52:12.840 --> 52:19.120\nIt's on Indiegogo, sorry about that.\n\n52:19.120 --> 52:24.040\nBut they, and these guys, they range from like literal war profiteers to where they're\n\n52:24.040 --> 52:28.760\njust like, you're just paying them $600 to drive you to a dangerous place to like actual\n\n52:28.760 --> 52:29.760\ngood journalists.\n\n52:29.760 --> 52:33.040\nLike there's this great New Yorker article that the two people we worked with for this\n\n52:33.040 --> 52:36.440\ndocumentary helped put together where like, this guy from the New Yorker was like, I\n\n52:36.440 --> 52:39.840\nwant to talk to some, I know this battle is going to start for Mosul, I want to talk to\n\n52:39.840 --> 52:43.720\nthese Iraqi special forces and they were like, well actually there's the SWAT team of guys\n\n52:43.720 --> 52:47.580\nthat were put together because they all had someone they know killed by ISIS and so it's\n\n52:47.580 --> 52:50.320\nlike this huge vengeance quest for all of these guys.\n\n52:50.320 --> 52:53.160\nThese are the dudes you should get embedded with and he did and it's a great article\n\n52:53.160 --> 52:55.000\non the New Yorker by Luke Mubleson.\n\n52:55.000 --> 53:00.840\nHe's there, so like, and it's not political the reason I'm asking the question, it's like,\n\n53:00.840 --> 53:12.240\nit's because you guys are, I, if I had a fire person up here, is that, a fire lady?\n\n53:12.240 --> 53:19.640\nIf I had a firefighter up here, which I never have, I'd be like, okay, why would you ever\n\n53:19.640 --> 53:20.920\nrun into a fire?\n\n53:20.920 --> 53:24.880\nAnd I know I get some answer, like, I feel comfortable because I've watched enough Scorsese\n\n53:24.880 --> 53:29.600\nmovies and stuff that I, you know, if they were like, well, my dad was a Southie and\n\n53:29.600 --> 53:34.760\nI said, you know, you got to fight fire, you know, and I'm like, and I'm not, I'm not,\n\n53:34.760 --> 53:39.600\nI'm not saying, I'm not trivializing it or undercutting it, I'm saying like, I can map\n\n53:39.600 --> 53:48.600\nthat in my universe the same way that in pre-Columbian Earth we could go, here there's dragons.\n\n53:48.600 --> 53:57.040\nI've always been fascinated with this archetype where you guys, like, you're, you're going\n\n53:57.040 --> 54:00.840\nand pointing and clicking and you're, and you're writing about and you're interviewing in these\n\n54:00.840 --> 54:06.760\nplaces that all we know about them and all we seem to continue to know about them is\n\n54:06.760 --> 54:10.400\nthat they're a mess and that, and that they're be dragons.\n\n54:10.400 --> 54:17.080\nAnd so I, I, I, I kind of like, I don't want you to compromise your integrity if, if you\n\n54:17.080 --> 54:22.640\nfeel like it makes you sound like a douchebag, but if you were to say to me, you know what,\n\n54:22.640 --> 54:28.800\nat the end of the day, it's just the perfect slot, like, I feel like it's just enough trouble\n\n54:28.800 --> 54:33.200\nand just low enough risk or if you put it on, I'd be like, okay, I got it, I got it.\n\n54:33.200 --> 54:34.200\nIt's not that.\n\n54:34.200 --> 54:38.320\nI think, okay, so this is where I think you're, and I think we're like 99% of people who\n\n54:38.320 --> 54:40.120\nhaven't been to a place like that.\n\n54:40.120 --> 54:42.840\nAnd I think probably most people who go there as part of the military because you only see\n\n54:42.840 --> 54:45.400\na very limited chunk of these countries when you're doing that.\n\n54:45.400 --> 54:48.120\nYou see it through the eyes of, of some of these geopolitical strengths.\n\n54:48.120 --> 54:49.120\nExactly.\n\n54:49.120 --> 54:54.360\nAnd you're in, like, even in a place like Iraq, most of the country is perfectly nice.\n\n54:54.360 --> 54:56.880\nLike geographically, most of the country is nice.\n\n54:56.880 --> 55:01.440\nIraqis are the kindest people to guests that you will ever meet in the world.\n\n55:01.440 --> 55:03.760\nThey will, there were times when we would be, we would be in Mosul.\n\n55:03.760 --> 55:07.640\nSo we're in the most dangerous city on earth probably, like there's all night you're hearing\n\n55:07.640 --> 55:12.160\nthe sounds of gunfire, there's fucking like vehicle based IEDs blowing up and like sending\n\n55:12.160 --> 55:16.720\nmushroom clouds up into the, up into the sky a mile away and you, you drive up to where\n\n55:16.720 --> 55:20.520\nlike just some dudes are bunked down and their job is to pull people out of like collapsed\n\n55:20.520 --> 55:21.520\nbuildings.\n\n55:21.520 --> 55:25.440\nThey got blown up in airstrikes every day and you're like, can we crash here tonight?\n\n55:25.440 --> 55:26.800\nAnd of course you're staying here tonight.\n\n55:26.800 --> 55:27.800\nWe're going to cook you dinner.\n\n55:27.800 --> 55:30.760\nLike we've got all this tea on, like we're getting our tobacco up.\n\n55:30.760 --> 55:32.040\nLet's talk and hang out all night.\n\n55:32.040 --> 55:34.360\nLike you guys will be as safe here as you are anywhere.\n\n55:34.360 --> 55:38.360\nLike if you spend more than like 20 minutes talking to anyone in their house in Iraq,\n\n55:38.360 --> 55:39.760\nthey're going to invite you to stay the night.\n\n55:39.760 --> 55:41.360\nThey're going to invite you to cook food for you.\n\n55:41.360 --> 55:43.280\nThey're going to put out tea for you.\n\n55:43.280 --> 55:47.000\nLike you have to, you have to turn people down from giving you hospitality.\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:51.320\nLike we would be talking to people who'd had family members killed in American airstrikes\n\n55:51.320 --> 55:54.000\nand had a lot of reasons to be angry at the U.S. and they would tell it to you.\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:57.120\nThey'd be like, you know, I have issues with your government, but I don't know that's just\n\n55:57.120 --> 55:58.120\nyour politicians.\n\n55:58.120 --> 56:00.880\nYou're a guest here in my home and I'm going to take the best care of you that you've ever\n\n56:00.880 --> 56:01.880\nhad taken of you.\n\n56:01.880 --> 56:06.080\nLike it's, you don't feel like when people are shooting at you during those limited\n\n56:06.080 --> 56:09.320\nchunks of time and they, they generally are pretty limited temporally.\n\n56:09.320 --> 56:13.520\nThey're, they're, they're in enough supply for me to the extent that it would ever happen.\n\n56:13.520 --> 56:14.520\nYeah.\n\n56:14.520 --> 56:15.520\nA little bit go a long way.\n\n56:15.520 --> 56:19.920\nBut that, that part, that part's like there's, there's fear in that part, but the rest of\n\n56:19.920 --> 56:21.760\nthe time you're not actively terrified.\n\n56:21.760 --> 56:22.760\nI'm sorry.\n\n56:22.760 --> 56:26.440\nWhen we mentioned homelessness one night after we were, thought we were finished filming\n\n56:26.440 --> 56:30.640\nthe documentary, I are the guy that we're, one of the guys we're doing it on.\n\n56:30.640 --> 56:34.960\nHe didn't understand the concept of homelessness and that just blew my mind.\n\n56:34.960 --> 56:35.960\nYeah.\n\n56:35.960 --> 56:39.200\nWe're talking with all these guys whose job again is to pull people out of like burning\n\n56:39.200 --> 56:41.080\nbuildings and whatnot.\n\n56:41.080 --> 56:43.760\nAnd like none of these guys have been paid in two and a half years because they're all\n\n56:43.760 --> 56:46.760\ncivil employees of the city that got taken over by ISIS.\n\n56:46.760 --> 56:49.400\nSo they spent two and a half years living under ISIS control.\n\n56:49.400 --> 56:52.960\nThe city got liberated and now they're doing the same job for the Iraqi government, but\n\n56:52.960 --> 56:56.400\nthey're still not getting paid because the government hasn't reactivated their paychecks.\n\n56:56.400 --> 56:59.000\nAnd we get onto the subject of homelessness in Los Angeles.\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:00.240\nAnd he's like, wait, go back home.\n\n57:00.240 --> 57:01.240\nWhat do you mean homeless people?\n\n57:01.240 --> 57:03.240\nLike, like they have less home?\n\n57:03.240 --> 57:04.240\nYeah.\n\n57:04.240 --> 57:05.240\nWe had to explain it.\n\n57:05.240 --> 57:06.240\nRight.\n\n57:06.240 --> 57:07.240\nWhere are their families?\n\n57:07.240 --> 57:11.840\nI would say that that is blowing my mind and also makes sense because you're like, wait,\n\n57:11.840 --> 57:20.520\nwhere else but a totally entrenched capitalistic first world empire would you go, oh, no home.\n\n57:20.520 --> 57:25.320\nWhat did he do wrong?\n\n57:25.320 --> 57:32.760\nBut is that, God, I don't mean to keep nagging you about this, but is that, why is that?\n\n57:32.760 --> 57:36.880\nLet me pitch you something, say yes or no.\n\n57:36.880 --> 57:45.840\nYou do it because you get the satisfaction of knowing that you've taken the more Keanu\n\n57:45.840 --> 57:49.880\npill from the Matrix than the Pantiliano's pill.\n\n57:49.880 --> 57:54.760\nI can't remember which color is which, but I know one hates women and one hates Pantiliano's.\n\n57:54.760 --> 57:59.120\nSee, well, that's the thing, like you're out there and there's sand in your head and you're\n\n57:59.120 --> 58:03.080\nlike, I'm like, what about the Matrix?\n\n58:03.080 --> 58:04.080\nIs that part of it?\n\n58:04.080 --> 58:06.840\nIs it like kind of like, man, I live in fucking Riyadh.\n\n58:06.840 --> 58:07.840\nPersonality, man.\n\n58:07.840 --> 58:14.320\nLike you're like a weird drone, you know, normal person and like, are you like a weird drone?\n\n58:14.320 --> 58:15.320\nYes.\n\n58:15.320 --> 58:19.000\nNo, me, I'm saying, I'm saying, is that part of the satisfaction of being like, yeah,\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:22.040\nI want to breathe free air, i.e. real air.\n\n58:22.040 --> 58:27.240\nI don't want to, I don't want to be like the actor, Joe Pantiliano, who you should really\n\n58:27.240 --> 58:33.200\nGoogle and appreciate in the Matrix, he's the Judas character who is like, give me the\n\n58:33.200 --> 58:38.720\nstake, give me the, you know, not a new myth, but it was modernized, so I use that to connect\n\n58:38.720 --> 58:39.720\nwith the kids.\n\n58:39.720 --> 58:42.680\nAlso, we kind of think that we're good at adventure.\n\n58:42.680 --> 58:44.760\nAnd so maybe we have a little bit of ego there.\n\n58:44.760 --> 58:48.800\nLike we think that we can get a little bit deeper than the journalist next to us.\n\n58:48.800 --> 58:49.800\nAnd so that's kind of a fun challenge.\n\n58:49.800 --> 58:51.640\nThere's a competitive aspect to it.\n\n58:51.640 --> 58:56.600\nI want to ask that really difficult question that I don't think I would ever have the balls\n\n58:56.600 --> 59:01.200\nto ask a soldier because I feel like I would be, I would actually almost be somehow spiritually\n\n59:01.200 --> 59:02.200\noffensive.\n\n59:02.200 --> 59:14.680\nBut do you guys feel like you're, like, karmically, like, no, not at all, like you get, like you\n\n59:14.680 --> 59:20.720\ngot a little bubble around you, like you're a hobbit and not an elf, like, no, we bought\n\n59:20.720 --> 59:21.720\nmedical kits.\n\n59:21.720 --> 59:27.720\nI'll just kind of, you know, I'm more important, not more important, but more like detached,\n\n59:27.720 --> 59:33.480\nlike, like, like when R2 and C3 people are walking through the spaceship in the beginning\n\n59:33.480 --> 59:36.440\nof the original Star Wars, you should look at that up too.\n\n59:36.440 --> 59:42.400\nI've seen the original Star Wars, I don't know what to believe anymore, but it's like,\n\n59:42.400 --> 59:47.000\nno one shoots a droid, why would you, you know, the answer is because one of them holds\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:48.000\nthe fucking hope.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:53.760\nIs that, is that, like, part of the journalist, like, like, like, fetish maybe?\n\n59:53.760 --> 59:54.760\nNo.\n\n59:54.760 --> 01:00:01.520\nI don't, like, for me, it's, like, I've always liked to travel and stuff, and I like that\n\n01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.520\nfeeling of, like, getting an idea of how, like, tiny you are.\n\n01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.600\nAnd it's also, like, extreme experiences are interesting, and there's nothing more extreme\n\n01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.600\nthan that experience.\n\n01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.200\nThere's nothing more extreme than, like, being in it.\n\n01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.000\nLike, it looks like, like, Mosul right now looks like you see these movies, like, World\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.640\nWar II movies of Stalingrad and stuff, like, what was the, the, the one about the sniper\n\n01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.640\nin there?\n\n01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:22.640\nI don't know.\n\n01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.640\nEnemy at the gates.\n\n01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.960\nLike, it looks, like, it looks like that, so you're seeing all this stuff that, like,\n\n01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.000\nyou never would have imagined seeing with your own eyes, and it's so shocking and weird\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nand fascinating.\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.440\nAnd as, like, a journalist, like, my whole, the whole thing that motivates me is talking\n\n01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.880\nto people with more interesting stories than me.\n\n01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.840\nAnd so that kind of place, like, you, any single person you just walk up to and start\n\n01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.440\ntalking to, they have experiences you can't imagine, they've seen things that I can't\n\n01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.160\neven comprehend, they have, they have a thousand experiences to tell me.\n\n01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.840\nSo, like, normally working, like, when I'm at the Republican National Convention or the\n\n01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.920\nDemocratic Convention, like, doing, like, you walk up to people and most people don't\n\n01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.760\nhave anything interesting, interesting to say, and the people that do have, like, two\n\n01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.760\ninteresting sentences.\n\n01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.800\nLike, you go to a place like that, everybody you talk to has a thousand fascinating things\n\n01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.800\nto say.\n\n01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:09.320\nAnd I would imagine, I don't want to take, but it's, it's the same way with pictures\n\n01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.040\nthere, too, like, anywhere you turn.\n\n01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.760\nThat was the, I was absolutely going to go there.\n\n01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.400\nOh, here's a, yeah, here's a concrete example.\n\n01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.480\nYou're holding up a can, you guys showed me these cans.\n\n01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.840\nThis is just in the department of, if you go far enough in the world, there's shit you\n\n01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.440\nwon't believe, which is, they sell cans of liquor.\n\n01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.680\nThis is canned whiskey.\n\n01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.680\nIt's not, it's not a mixed drink.\n\n01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.520\nLike it's not, it's not a whiskey soda.\n\n01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.720\nIt's not like a little bit of whiskey poured into it.\n\n01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.080\nThis is straight whiskey.\n\n01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:43.480\nAnd there's, it's around for sips, if people want sips, it's not going to push it.\n\n01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:47.080\nThere is a can, there is a can back at the bar that should be open now, if people want\n\n01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.680\nto take little bits of it, and we can pass this around.\n\n01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.680\nIt's God awful.\n\n01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.040\nUm, I'm not, there's, there's no sugarcoating this.\n\n01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.040\nIt's the worst thing to drink.\n\n01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.080\nWe have a hand raised, I'll reward your politeness by giving you the floor.\n\n01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.080\nI'll fall on that grenade.\n\n01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.560\nOh, wait, what?\n\n01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.400\nOh, oh, you just went liquor.\n\n01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.400\nJesus.\n\n01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.720\nAnd you used the worst metaphor ever.\n\n01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.920\nNot that they're soldiers, but like, I mean, that is like,\n\n01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.680\nYou know, Willie Roberts, he found a grenade in Los Feliz.\n\n01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.680\nWhat?\n\n01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.280\nHe just found a grenade somewhere.\n\n01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.160\nThe police came and blew it up.\n\n01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.160\nOh, nice.\n\n01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.160\nAll right.\n\n01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.160\nNext episode.\n\n01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.160\nYeah.\n\n01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.160\nYou would, you would have loved it.\n\n01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:31.600\nI wanted to, we, we, because Magenta, you're, uh, you look for, through a camera while\n\n01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.600\nyou're there.\n\n01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.600\nI'm not pigeonholing you because you said backstage like, well, you'll like to do the,\n\n01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:44.000\nyou want to do the typing too, but, um, or the talking, you guys overlap or the talking\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:53.680\nbut the, okay, but the I, when you're abroad and you're covering war, uh, what, I, I, I,\n\n01:02:53.680 --> 01:03:01.840\nlike you, you be the judge of whether or not it's like, uh, should we, do you want to talk\n\n01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:08.440\nabout it or do you want to show some of the stuff, uh, that you guys brought while you\n\n01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440\ntalk about it?\n\n01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.840\nIs that like a better way to do it?\n\n01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.200\nYou can do that at some point, any, any point you want.\n\n01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:18.000\nCause I think, yeah, it'd probably be an easy thing in the, for the audio podcast listeners.\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.080\nIf we're, let's just look at some stuff and let's just make an edit point here and say,\n\n01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.960\nhey, $5 a month.\n\n01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:31.960\nOh, for the, for the podcast, we should just put in like screaming, just like screeching\n\n01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.320\nand just the solid me undies ad.\n\n01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.320\nYeah.\n\n01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.320\nHere's a, here's a free me undies ad I want to give.\n\n01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.440\nI shit my pants this morning.\n\n01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.920\nWhere were you?\n\n01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:50.200\nBecause of a weekend of drinking nothing but Soylent because my girlfriend is writing.\n\n01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:59.040\nSo she's not around to order pizza with, uh, I, I was so unwilling to throw my me undies\n\n01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.640\naway.\n\n01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:10.760\nI watched them in the sink, which sink that was not an ad for Soylent.\n\n01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.680\nMe undies didn't pay for it.\n\n01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.400\nI just love me undies that much and don't want to throw them away.\n\n01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400\nAll right.\n\n01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.400\nWell, that's convinced me.\n\n01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.400\nHow do I get these underpants?\n\n01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:24.880\nI'll get, uh, you, you, yeah, go to, not those underpants, right?\n\n01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.760\nI'm telling you, they're, it's like, it's, it's, it's incredible.\n\n01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.680\nYou can put them on Kickstarter.\n\n01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.440\nI mean, but that's why, and then I go like, well, so why would I go to Iraq?\n\n01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.800\nThey don't have me undies.\n\n01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.840\nI mean, they, they might have them there.\n\n01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.560\nWell, if we, if we, if we bring freedom to them, of course, you know, what, what I did\n\n01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:46.160\nget over there was a pair, a great pair of Hugo bass underwear.\n\n01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.960\nBut did they have micro modale, a fabric that's three times softer than cotton?\n\n01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960\nNice.\n\n01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.960\nNice.\n\n01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.400\nI, is that a, is that a synthetic fiber?\n\n01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.400\nOh yeah.\n\n01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.160\nIt's made in LA, I think.\n\n01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.640\nYou don't want to wear synthetic fibers and cause when things light on fire around you,\n\n01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.800\nthey can melt to your skin.\n\n01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.160\nIf you get hit by an incendiary, you want to have natural fiber.\n\n01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.680\nWhat's the verdict on the whiskey so far?\n\n01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:12.680\nIt's good.\n\n01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.680\nAll right.\n\n01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.600\nI can't, I can't believe y'all are saying that.\n\n01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.080\nDo you want the actual, this is the actual whiskey.\n\n01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.080\nThis one's different.\n\n01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.080\nIt's not a sweet.\n\n01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.080\nOh man.\n\n01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.080\nOh man.\n\n01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.080\nPart of a faux pas.\n\n01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.080\nAll right.\n\n01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.080\nNo, do it.\n\n01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.080\nNo, go ahead.\n\n01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.440\nAnd let's put a, we'll put a little edit marker somewhere around here.\n\n01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.440\nIf you're...\n\n01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.440\nIt's a mannequin challenge.\n\n01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.440\nIt's pretty funny.\n\n01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.000\nWe're going to, we're going to look at some stuff that only you guys are looking at because\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nyou're here.\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.640\nWe'll describe it to you though.\n\n01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.280\nThere's a feminist American militia one.\n\n01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.280\nStart with the mannequin challenge.\n\n01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.280\nThat was pretty funny.\n\n01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.280\nYeah.\n\n01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.280\nSo this is, so I went to these guys and was like, I want to do this, there's this thing\n\n01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.600\ncalled the mannequin challenge, guys who are in an active war zone.\n\n01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.360\nI want you to do this for me.\n\n01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.360\nAnd they were like, no.\n\n01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.360\nI love it.\n\n01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:59.800\nSo you had the balls to say to them, hey, could you plank for me and...\n\n01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.800\nYeah.\n\n01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:05.000\nYeah, does this sort of thing happen a lot as like people dabbing when grenades are going\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nthrough the air?\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nNo.\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.960\nIce bucket challenge.\n\n01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.480\nSo he tells him to do this and they say, no, but part of his job, like the reason he's\n\n01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:17.400\na good fixer, the reason he can get journalists places is that he just, he meets a lot of\n\n01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:21.000\nofficers and like captains, colonels, generals, and you get their phone numbers.\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.360\nLike it's the Iraqi military is not like the US military.\n\n01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.600\nLike it's all about who you know, you bring people cigarettes and they're your buddy.\n\n01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:31.000\nSo he calls their captain up and he says, I want you to make them do this.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.680\nAnd their captain called them and said, do this.\n\n01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.680\nAnd then they had to do it.\n\n01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.960\nAnd you can tell how pissed they are in the video.\n\n01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:43.440\nIs it going to fuck things up because I don't think Joel's going to be able to contain himself.\n\n01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.440\nYou're what?\n\n01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.600\nHe's going to start making funny riffs during the...\n\n01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:47.600\nI think that's fine.\n\n01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.400\nNo, we all, you all know how this, you all know how the mannequin challenge goes.\n\n01:06:51.400 --> 01:07:01.400\nAll right, well, since I was but you said, of course, see, just like real men, that girl\n\n01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:09.400\nis a real crowd, please, small world, all the friends know me, young boy living like an\n\n01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:17.400\nold kid, release the cash, watch it fall slowly, right girl, still trying to get it, haters\n\n01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.400\nmad for whatever reason.\n\n01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:26.400\nThey're smoking the air, they're drinking, they lose it when the DJ drops and he ain't\n\n01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.400\ngonna lose.\n\n01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:33.400\nGetting so gone, I'm not thinking, what in the world was I thinking today?\n\n01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.400\nNo money to be made.\n\n01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.400\nDamn.\n\n01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:41.400\nRappers ain't shit.\n\n01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.400\nRappers are not shit.\n\n01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:49.400\nIf you have guns in your video and you're trying to act hard and shit, you're not this fucking\n\n01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.400\nhard.\n\n01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.400\nThis is as hard as a fucking hit.\n\n01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.400\nI think you won the mannequin challenge.\n\n01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.400\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:02.400\nIt's weird to think about because when we think of soldiers, we think of army men, we think\n\n01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.400\nof World War II, we think of guys in camouflage holding guns because they're detached from\n\n01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.400\nwhat's going on at home.\n\n01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.400\nAnd what's going on at home is television and Bart Simpson and donuts and that's what\n\n01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.400\nthey're fighting for and all this stuff.\n\n01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:21.400\nSo to be in a third world country and be holding an assault rifle and your orders are to kill\n\n01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:26.400\nanother human being with fast flying pieces of metal that are gonna be projected from\n\n01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:32.400\nyour gun, but to have a phone in your pocket connected to Donald Trump's tweets and stranger\n\n01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.400\nthings, gossip.\n\n01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.400\nI don't know if like, and to have a journalist telling you, hey, do you know what the mannequin\n\n01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.400\nchallenge is?\n\n01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.400\nOh yeah, I know what that is.\n\n01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.400\nI'll do that.\n\n01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.400\nI'm gonna go back to blowing the head off of someone if they do the wrong thing like\n\n01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.400\nappear in front of me.\n\n01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.400\nI want to clarify that was filmed by IR who's our fixer.\n\n01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:52.400\nWe had nothing to do with that.\n\n01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.400\nThat was his purely he was motivated to do that when he was up there.\n\n01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.400\nWait, so you weren't there?\n\n01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.400\nI was not there at that point.\n\n01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.400\nNo, that was in October.\n\n01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.400\nSo he's like, hey, should I do the mannequin challenge?\n\n01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.400\nAnd you're like, you don't have to do that for me.\n\n01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.400\nAnd he's like, no, it'll be great.\n\n01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.400\nOh, he did that for him.\n\n01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.400\nThat was all for IR.\n\n01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:09.400\nHow do you get, how do you get people to trust you?\n\n01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:12.400\nHow do you get people to take you where you need to go to see things?\n\n01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.400\nI mean, it's, it's most about meeting good people.\n\n01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.400\nSo before we went over there, I got the numbers and names of a bunch of different fixers who\n\n01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.400\nare all people who said they could do this for us.\n\n01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:24.400\nAnd then I found people who they were connected to on Twitter who had like the guy that I\n\n01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.400\nwound up reaching out to runs a company that helps recover people who have been kidnapped\n\n01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.400\nand ransomed.\n\n01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:34.400\nSo this guy was a friend of the guy that I was going to work with when it was like a\n\n01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.400\nTwitter buddy of the guy was going to work with.\n\n01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.400\nAnd I was like, hey, did you work with this guy in Iraq?\n\n01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.400\nAnd he said, yes.\n\n01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.400\nSo this guy has like clear credentials.\n\n01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.400\nHe knows what he's doing.\n\n01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.400\nHe's got a record.\n\n01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.400\nI say, can I trust this guy?\n\n01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.400\nAnd he says, yes, I would say you can trust him with your life.\n\n01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.400\nDo people like, do they know you're liberal?\n\n01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.400\nDo they care that their story is going to get told a certain way?\n\n01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:56.400\nI have, I, we, the first time we met, oh, sorry.\n\n01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.400\nI think they're hyper aware around journalists.\n\n01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.400\nOkay.\n\n01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.400\nThey don't want.\n\n01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.400\nBullshit.\n\n01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.400\nSo you have to really sift through it.\n\n01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.400\nAnd how do you do that?\n\n01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.400\nHow do you get to like, we want to know what's really going on?\n\n01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:09.400\nDo you want to talk about the Japanese guy that was there for a week?\n\n01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.400\nYeah.\n\n01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.400\nSo this sets up some of the other footage.\n\n01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.400\nSo like, this kind of dovetails in the topic of fake news.\n\n01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.400\nSo we're there.\n\n01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:21.400\nWe're there one morning and we drive into West Mosul, which is the part of the city\n\n01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.400\nthat's still a big chunk of it's held by ISIS.\n\n01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:27.400\nAnd we get up to the front and our fixers are with us like, there's going to be a\n\n01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.400\ncaravan with a bunch of other journalists and a bunch of Iraqi army guys.\n\n01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.400\nWe need to ride with them up to the front, but we want to escape from them as soon as\n\n01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.400\nwe can so we can run around without handlers and whatnot so we can actually get a good\n\n01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.400\nstory.\n\n01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.400\nSeems like a good idea.\n\n01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.400\nYeah.\n\n01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.400\nYou don't want to be where all the other people with cameras are, but we wound up getting\n\n01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.400\ncorralled into this van and wind up with these guys anyway.\n\n01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.400\nAnd they take us to a section of the front line and where there are five minutes and\n\n01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.400\nthere's one or two sniper shots from ISIS and they just start firing.\n\n01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.400\nThe Iraqi army just starts firing all of the RPGs and these big weapons called\n\n01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.400\nSPG-9s and just shooting everything off.\n\n01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.400\nYou called my name.\n\n01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.400\nYou were talking to me and I was walking through this part that you're supposed to run\n\n01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.400\nthrough, but he said my name so I turned around and I forgot that I'm not supposed to\n\n01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.400\nlike, that's not a good place to stand.\n\n01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.400\nSo I was there for too long so someone started shooting.\n\n01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.400\nBut there was a berm above us.\n\n01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.400\nNobody could hit us, which was the point.\n\n01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.400\nSo this is the point is that we were never in, it was not a real firefight.\n\n01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.400\nWe watched this thing happen and it's incredibly, it looks like a movie, it feels like an\n\n01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.400\nactual fight, and then after it gets done and all these, there's like 20 people filming\n\n01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.400\nit, our fixers turn to us and they're like, you know that was mostly bullshit, right?\n\n01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.400\nLike every morning they lead journalists right here and there's always that, that always happens.\n\n01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.400\nIt's like 1,000 outgoing shots for everyone I'm coming.\n\n01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:43.400\nBut you guys know, that takes me back to this all important point.\n\n01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:54.400\nIt's like you guys do perceive the, like you, do you make peace with the idea like I do\n\n01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:02.400\nwhen I fly on an airplane, period, because it's, that's too much for me to be out of\n\n01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:08.400\nthat much control and to have these savages called flight attendants like in charge of\n\n01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.400\nmy destiny.\n\n01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:19.400\nLike I need to decide before I get on the plane, I might die, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.400\nI hope not to.\n\n01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.400\nYou could argue I expect not to.\n\n01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.400\nI will complain if I start dying.\n\n01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.400\nI will go to my grave dying.\n\n01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.400\nIf I did what you do, I can't do that.\n\n01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.400\nI can't be like, oh, look at that landmine go off.\n\n01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.400\nWait, there's one under me.\n\n01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.400\nI've had it.\n\n01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:45.400\nBut if I get on a United Airlines and a cop starts tasing me because their Christmas discount\n\n01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:50.400\nisn't working or whatever the fuck, I can be like, this is bullshit.\n\n01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.400\nIt might not work, but at least I have that recourse.\n\n01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.400\nThat is a blanket we wrap around ourselves.\n\n01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.400\nWe feel like complaining.\n\n01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:03.400\nWe're never more than one complain away from our mommy grabbing us and going, it's okay.\n\n01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.400\nAnd that's why I continue to eat meat.\n\n01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:12.400\nBecause to continue to do what you did before and to only cry out and to only do things\n\n01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.400\nwhen something's wrong, that's just primatology.\n\n01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:23.400\nAnd that's why I keep harping on that because I truly do wish because I want to know.\n\n01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.400\nThe biggest thing in my mind is I want to know, when you guys look at people like me,\n\n01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.400\ndo you go, you fucking gross piece of shit?\n\n01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.400\nOr are you like, that's the customer.\n\n01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.400\nWell, let's go up.\n\n01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.400\nTake some more pictures of landmines for them.\n\n01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:43.400\nOkay, so here's what you're getting at there is what makes something really scary is not having any control.\n\n01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:48.400\nThey did a series of studies on fighter pilots in Vietnam back during that whole war thing\n\n01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:53.400\nand they found out that, so most of these fighters would have, there's the actual pilot and then there's the navigator.\n\n01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:58.400\nAnd so in the weeks leading up to the mission, the navigator who was planning the mission,\n\n01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.400\nwho was deciding where they were going to go and exactly what was going to happen, had very low stress levels.\n\n01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.400\nAnd the fighter pilot's stress levels spiked because they had no control over anything.\n\n01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:11.400\nAnd then during the actual mission, when they're actually flying, the fighter pilots have zero stress,\n\n01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.400\nbut the navigator's stress spikes because you have no control over that plane.\n\n01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.400\nThat's what makes things scary is the lack of control.\n\n01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.400\nSo when you're in a plane at 30, 40,000 feet, however the fuck high planes go,\n\n01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.400\nI don't have any more ability to affect that than you do.\n\n01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:29.400\nBut like when I'm in Mosul and somebody might shoot at me,\n\n01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:36.400\nI have the ability to run and hide behind a heavy wall or find the biggest Iraqi guy in a body armor and hide behind the wall.\n\n01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.400\nThat's the whole problem though. That's the thing, like when I go in the Batman ride at Six Flags.\n\n01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:46.400\nCompletely perfect parallel.\n\n01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:50.400\nIt's the only parallel I have.\n\n01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:56.400\nWhen they lower a big fucking 90s or more modern like great over you,\n\n01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.400\nlike eating meat by the way, it's like I'm telling you,\n\n01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:04.400\nwhen you have society's fucking permission to be like a piece of garbage,\n\n01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.400\nwhen you're like clank, you're like it's not my fault if anyone gets decapitated on this ride.\n\n01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.400\nI can't, I'm in a Batman harness.\n\n01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.400\nI can't do shit. Scariest roller coaster I ever went on.\n\n01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.400\nThe world's oldest roller coaster is like Six Flags.\n\n01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:27.400\nThe eagle, they put you in a wagon and put a jump rope across your lap.\n\n01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:32.400\nI am now at fault if everyone dies, including myself.\n\n01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.400\nI'm going to fail.\n\n01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.400\nThat to me is, you're saying, you sound like you'd be like,\n\n01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:42.400\nwhoof, hate being in that Batman harness, not enough control.\n\n01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.400\nI'm like, what are you talking about?\n\n01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.400\nGive me a sedative.\n\n01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.400\nWould you rather kill yourself or someone else kill you?\n\n01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.400\nWould I rather kill myself or have someone else kill me?\n\n01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.400\nOkay, I love you.\n\n01:15:53.400 --> 01:16:00.400\nBy the way, I also love our audience who tweeted,\n\n01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.400\nI said we have war journalists fresh back from Middle East\n\n01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:09.400\nand there's a fucking handful of shit that would make Chomsky fumfer.\n\n01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.400\nI want to get to them, but I also want to see photos.\n\n01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.400\nI want to ask, okay, would I rather kill myself or be killed?\n\n01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.400\nI'd rather kill myself.\n\n01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.400\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:29.400\nBut here's the thing.\n\n01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.400\nI think this is really important.\n\n01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:37.400\nThat's an easy question to answer because it's like a credit card bill\n\n01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.400\nthat you buy control.\n\n01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:48.400\nIf you asked me, you have to die at 12 a.m.,\n\n01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:52.400\nis it going to be by your own hand or by a stranger?\n\n01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.400\nWould my answer change?\n\n01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.400\nBecause when you say, would you rather kill yourself or be killed,\n\n01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:00.400\nall I hear is control versus lack of control.\n\n01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:03.400\nInstead of Batman versus old roller coaster, because that doesn't make sense.\n\n01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.400\nYou should want the old roller coaster, not Batman.\n\n01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:10.400\nI want to kill myself because then I get to just be like,\n\n01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.400\nokay, well, maybe today, maybe tomorrow.\n\n01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.400\nGladly pay you for a hamburger.\n\n01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.400\nThat's what we're all doing.\n\n01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.400\nWe're kind of like going like, how are you doing, Joel?\n\n01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.400\nI have an idea.\n\n01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.400\nI was just going to say about being in situations where it's dangerous\n\n01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:30.400\nand there's tension and a threat.\n\n01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.400\nA lot of it is gradual.\n\n01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.400\nYou move into it slowly and you could say your job,\n\n01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.400\nyou could say your job is scary and there's a lot of tension.\n\n01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:42.400\nThere's a lot of money getting thrown around and you have to make a show.\n\n01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:47.400\nAnd for a lot of people, that would be very daunting and you gradually moved into it.\n\n01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.400\nAnd so I think that's one piece of this,\n\n01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:54.400\nis just that you slowly get into more and more dramatic situations\n\n01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.400\nand you always feel like you may have leverage in your pocket like a way.\n\n01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.400\nI felt like when I was working on community,\n\n01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:07.400\nall of a sudden I'm on a network sitcom and I'm surrounded by people who are fucking pros\n\n01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.400\nand I'm coming from it.\n\n01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.400\nI got fired from basic cable.\n\n01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.400\nI wasn't even able to hold myself there.\n\n01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.400\nI'm like, these people are diplomats.\n\n01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.400\nI'm on King's Landing and I'm a fucking wildling.\n\n01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.400\nDo you guys know what that means?\n\n01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.400\nNo, you were out fucking doing important shit.\n\n01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.400\nGame of Thrones is important shit, Dan.\n\n01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.400\nThat's not downplaying the importance of that.\n\n01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.400\nAnd I distinctly recall, because I was like,\n\n01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:39.400\nwell, I've always been a piece of shit that loves having attention paid to me\n\n01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:43.400\nand I did notice that the people I was the most afraid of,\n\n01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.400\nbecause of their business acumen, because of their diplomacy,\n\n01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.400\nbecause of their savvy, when the spotlight would hit me,\n\n01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.400\nthey would shrink away.\n\n01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.400\nThey would be like, don't talk about that.\n\n01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.400\nNo, I don't want to do an interview with them.\n\n01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:04.400\nI'd be like, oh, so if I'm Colonel Sanders, it's my fried chicken.\n\n01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.400\nDoes that make sense?\n\n01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.400\nSo that's an example.\n\n01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.400\nI could picture a firefighter even going like,\n\n01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:18.400\nokay, so, oh, you're scared about the idea of running into a burning building\n\n01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.400\nbecause it's mystical to you.\n\n01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:27.400\nI found something that I've demystified and I can continue to explore it.\n\n01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.400\nThat person's not going to go back and go,\n\n01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:33.400\nbut what about my parcheesy skills?\n\n01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.400\nThat person's going to continue to go like,\n\n01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.400\nI want to grow in that direction.\n\n01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:40.400\nI want to...\n\n01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:46.400\nThat's helping me not hate myself for living on the same earth as you.\n\n01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.400\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.400\nBecause I'm worried I'm not a good person, but now I realize nothing matters.\n\n01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.400\nBut being a good person has nothing to do with doing stuff that's like dangerous\n\n01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.400\nand ill advised.\n\n01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.400\nYou can see that because you traipse over the military zones.\n\n01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.400\nOh, who's the thing?\n\n01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.400\nI live in the matrix. I love my state.\n\n01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.400\nNo, we all live in the same city here.\n\n01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.400\nI get that sometimes around.\n\n01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.400\nNo, you live on earth. You live in reality.\n\n01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.400\nYou're a child of God.\n\n01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.400\nI'm a fat, fucking horrible agent of compromise.\n\n01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.400\nAnd you know that.\n\n01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:22.400\nAnd the fact that you won't admit it makes me hate you.\n\n01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.400\nThere's nothing more without compromise.\n\n01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.400\nKill me.\n\n01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.400\nSo I don't have to kill myself.\n\n01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.400\nI know you know people with guns.\n\n01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.400\nI don't have the balls to get my own.\n\n01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:41.400\nMy 10-day waiting period is plus seven months.\n\n01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.400\nAll right.\n\n01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.400\nLet's roll some of that beautiful bean footage.\n\n01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:51.400\nMagenta, do we have stuff up here that you've photographed?\n\n01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.400\nOkay.\n\n01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.400\nLet's look at...\n\n01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.400\nI want to look at war photography.\n\n01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.400\nYeah, that's what I was starting to walk...\n\n01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.400\nDo you want someone getting shot?\n\n01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.400\nNo.\n\n01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.400\nWhy am I saying no?\n\n01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.400\nI want the part of war where everyone high-fives.\n\n01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.400\nDo you want to do the screening with us in Iraq?\n\n01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.400\nNo, we don't want to do anything.\n\n01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.400\nWe'll keep you safe.\n\n01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.400\nWe'll be a really nice hotel.\n\n01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.400\nThe hotel is really nice.\n\n01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:24.400\nShould we go do a Harmontown in the Middle East?\n\n01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.400\nYeah!\n\n01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.400\nI'm telling you, if you want to go...\n\n01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.400\nWe could talk about this later if you're serious,\n\n01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.400\nbut if you want to do a Harmontown in Arabil,\n\n01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.400\nit is a safer city than Los Angeles.\n\n01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.400\nWhat if we do a Harmontown there and it's 9-11?\n\n01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.400\nThey didn't do 9-11.\n\n01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.400\nI know. I'm just saying. Wouldn't it be weird?\n\n01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:46.400\nSo I was like, it's 9-11.\n\n01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.400\nLet's just look at some pictures.\n\n01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.400\nYou tell me, Magenta,\n\n01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.400\nif you're...\n\n01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.400\nThe average person is like,\n\n01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.400\nI don't even understand any photographer.\n\n01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.400\nI admire all of them.\n\n01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.400\nThey look through a lens and they go,\n\n01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:07.400\nthat's a good picture as opposed to everything else I look at.\n\n01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:11.400\nCan you shed any verbal light on what it is\n\n01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:14.400\nyou're supposed to do when you want to take pictures of shit?\n\n01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.400\nShed that verbal light, y'all.\n\n01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.400\nWell, photography is very different.\n\n01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.400\nWhich is why I have a chance,\n\n01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.400\nbecause I'm a horrible photographer.\n\n01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.400\nI'm not a photographer.\n\n01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.400\nI'm just trying this new thing out that I like.\n\n01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.400\nAnd so you can't have as much control as you want to have,\n\n01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.400\nwhich would be awkward for you, I guess.\n\n01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.400\nWho is that?\n\n01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.400\nIf I was like, I prefer to write\n\n01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:38.400\nin a tank of water hanging upside down.\n\n01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.400\nWhat are the shows that they do on the street?\n\n01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:44.400\nIf my script is like, that's good for a guy\n\n01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.400\nhanging upside down in a tank of water.\n\n01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.400\nIt's like Christian rock.\n\n01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.400\nCan't plan Christian rock?\n\n01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:53.400\nIf you're bad at rock, you're still Christian.\n\n01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.400\nIt doesn't have to be Van Halen.\n\n01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.400\nYou love Christ.\n\n01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.400\nIf you're photographing Iraq,\n\n01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.400\nyou're like, well, there was a guy shooting at me.\n\n01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:07.400\nOr a lady.\n\n01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.400\nIt's a great place to practice.\n\n01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.400\nNo, but I'm sorry.\n\n01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.400\nI got distracted by my fucking dumb shit.\n\n01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:16.400\nBut there is a little bit of truth to that.\n\n01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:20.400\nYou're like, well, I don't want to be Ansel Adams,\n\n01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.400\nbecause I don't know how to deal with that internal.\n\n01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.400\nMy therapist says, run on the engine, not the pistons.\n\n01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.400\nSo when you're photographing in the field,\n\n01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:34.400\nare you like, do you discriminate?\n\n01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.400\nAre you looking?\n\n01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.400\nThat's a good picture.\n\n01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.400\nI'll figure it out later.\n\n01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.400\nSo probably somewhere in between.\n\n01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.400\nI just do whatever I feel like doing,\n\n01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.400\nand he'll be like, look that way,\n\n01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.400\nand then I just start doing that.\n\n01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:52.400\nAnd it's like, and look that way is based on?\n\n01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.400\nWell, some of it's like we're filming a documentary out there.\n\n01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.400\nSo some of it's like, oh, we need footage of this.\n\n01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.400\nOr I'm saying something,\n\n01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.400\nand we want to get them on camera saying this,\n\n01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.400\ncan you get over here?\n\n01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.400\nTalk about the eyes that you see in a lot of those people,\n\n01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:08.400\nand how that little kid you saw in the back of the truck,\n\n01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:11.400\nlike sometimes people's eyes,\n\n01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.400\njust like you see someone and it's like magnetic.\n\n01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.400\nYou just get pulled to them.\n\n01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.400\nIf you want to, you know, if you want to,\n\n01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.400\nbecause it's audio, it's a podcast.\n\n01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.400\nThat's probably not interesting.\n\n01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:27.400\nSome of their eyes are magnetic, I don't know.\n\n01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:32.400\nHave I been, maybe I've been stupid,\n\n01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.400\nbut you're doing all video, are you doing still photographs?\n\n01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.400\nLast time we did photographs,\n\n01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.400\nand so I bought the A6000 and he's like,\n\n01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.400\noh, let's make a documentary.\n\n01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:45.400\nSo we just bought a GoPro in Iraq at the mall\n\n01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.400\nto make the documentary and use the A6000.\n\n01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.400\nSo you're a videographer, I have this 80s thing in my head\n\n01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.400\nwhere it's like James Woods with a vest,\n\n01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.400\nand he's like got film roles.\n\n01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.400\nJames Woods was there.\n\n01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.400\nThe right instant will end up on the cover of time\n\n01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.400\nand change the way people vote.\n\n01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:06.400\nI mean, that's not, it's like you're getting footage\n\n01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.400\nof shit that could also be on the cover\n\n01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.400\nof a Harry Potter version of Time\n\n01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.400\nwhere things on the cover move.\n\n01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.400\nAnd do you ever use stills from your video?\n\n01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.400\nA little bit.\n\n01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.400\nAwesome. Let's take a look.\n\n01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:27.400\nLet's look at, what would you want people to see?\n\n01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.400\nWell, there's three videos that tell a little bit of the story\n\n01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.400\nwe were just talking about.\n\n01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.400\nSo let's start with RPG Fire, which comes from\n\n01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:36.400\nthat first firefight we saw.\n\n01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:41.400\nI just fired an RPG in my HTC Vive at home.\n\n01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.400\nIt's a VR simulator of a...\n\n01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.400\nThen you can tell us how accurate this is.\n\n01:25:48.400 --> 01:26:02.400\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.400\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.400\nThis is fake. This is the fake one.\n\n01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.400\nWeapons and stuff.\n\n01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.400\nThousands of dollars.\n\n01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.400\nThat's like your...\n\n01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.400\nThat's like Gilligan's Island tour.\n\n01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.400\nISIS shot about two rounds at us,\n\n01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:16.400\nand the Iraqi army fired everything that they had back at them.\n\n01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.400\nThey were aiming...\n\n01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.400\nThey were pivoting towards the cameras at points.\n\n01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.400\nYou can see it.\n\n01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.400\nAnd then afterwards, the second video,\n\n01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.400\nthey had a musical number for the cameras.\n\n01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.400\nIt was literally like a Pirates of the Caribbean,\n\n01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.400\nbecause there's 20-some journalists there all filming.\n\n01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.400\nSo at the end of this, there's your little firefight.\n\n01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:35.400\nYou get your 20 minutes of the Iraqi army shooting at ISIS footage.\n\n01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.400\nThen we do a song and a dance,\n\n01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.400\nand then we get you back on the bus.\n\n01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.400\nAnd you're saying, I can't wait to break away from that.\n\n01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.400\nShow me the real Tijuana.\n\n01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.400\nThat's what you're saying.\n\n01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:44.400\nThis is kind of what's going on.\n\n01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.400\nOkay, so have you seen the fucking beheading videos?\n\n01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.400\nWhat happens to journalists that...\n\n01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.400\nIf you're dead, you don't know you're dead,\n\n01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.400\nso why does it matter?\n\n01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.400\nYou know while you're being beheaded,\n\n01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:57.400\nit takes a long time.\n\n01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:58.400\nThey just use a knife.\n\n01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.400\nI put together a video for Cracked before we went out there,\n\n01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.400\nthat was just about ISIS propaganda.\n\n01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:05.400\nSo I had to watch all of their beheading videos,\n\n01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:08.400\nand it was like, yeah, that's a little bit intimidating,\n\n01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.400\nbut at the same time, you're way likelier to get killed in an airstrike,\n\n01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.400\njust because one of them misses the target.\n\n01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.400\nSo that's comforting, kind of.\n\n01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:19.400\nYeah.\n\n01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.400\nI did have a brief feeling.\n\n01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:25.400\nI remember Easter Sunday, you guys were probably over there.\n\n01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:28.400\nIt was like, just because this is how...\n\n01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:35.400\nWhat's his face from North Korea unveiled his nuclear missiles,\n\n01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.400\nand it was Easter Sunday, and we went to a barbecue,\n\n01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:42.400\nand all hipsters had to talk about was the idea of\n\n01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.400\nwhat if a nuclear missile landed on Los Angeles and blew us all up,\n\n01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.400\nand we definitely all agreed that that would be a way better way to go\n\n01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.400\nthan what would happen if North Korea wasn't in the picture,\n\n01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.400\nand Trump just had his run, you know,\n\n01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.400\nbecause the latter would be like,\n\n01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:02.400\noh, I'm gonna have to eat a foot.\n\n01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.400\nYeah.\n\n01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.400\nIt may or may not be my own.\n\n01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.400\nI have to swing someone else's daughter as a weapon.\n\n01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.400\nYou want to slow cook foot.\n\n01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.400\nThat's the real key with a foot,\n\n01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.400\nis you don't want to try too fast to cook that,\n\n01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.400\nbecause you want to let...\n\n01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.400\nYou've got to peel off the cows.\n\n01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.400\nSo those guys took you through there, and they're like...\n\n01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.400\nSo what's their agenda?\n\n01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:26.400\nYou're American journalists, and they want you to say what?\n\n01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.400\nWhat do they want you to say?\n\n01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.400\nWhat do you mean?\n\n01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.400\nWell, if they're staging that stuff...\n\n01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.400\nHillary Clinton started ISIS.\n\n01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.400\nA lot of people think that.\n\n01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.400\nWait, so I say it again, Magenta.\n\n01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.400\nA big popular belief is that Hillary Clinton started ISIS.\n\n01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.400\nWait, so there's nobody over there that's like,\n\n01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:47.400\nwell, if we show you this and that, you'll write that.\n\n01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.400\nNo.\n\n01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.400\nThe Iraqi army guys want you to say\n\n01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.400\nthat the Iraqi army is winning the battle against ISIS,\n\n01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.400\nand they're good dudes.\n\n01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.400\nMost of the guys we met are nice dudes.\n\n01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.400\nI have nothing against...\n\n01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.400\nI was really impressed with a lot of them.\n\n01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.400\nBut they want you...\n\n01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.400\nYou get the same thing, whether you're talking to the Kurdish Peshmerger,\n\n01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.400\nwhich are these ancestral mountain warriors of the Kurds,\n\n01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.400\nor whether you're talking about the Iraqi army,\n\n01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.400\nor the Iraqi federal police, which are basically an army unit.\n\n01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.400\nThey all are like, we love America.\n\n01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.400\nWe're just trying to stop the bad guys.\n\n01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.400\nPlease send us more weapons.\n\n01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.400\nBut don't you get...\n\n01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:20.400\nI recently found out there's three women on the Supreme Court,\n\n01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.400\nand I had made a joke about there being only one.\n\n01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.400\nDid you graduate?\n\n01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.400\nDo you have a 200 IQ?\n\n01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.400\nDon't you worry about going...\n\n01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.400\nThat's another reason I wouldn't go to the Middle East,\n\n01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.400\nbecause I'd be like, I can't point to where we are on a map,\n\n01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.400\nand I don't know anything about anything.\n\n01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.400\nThat's how you learn.\n\n01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.400\nTwo college dropouts right here.\n\n01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.400\nYou learn by just being plunged into it?\n\n01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:45.400\nYeah, guys.\n\n01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:48.400\nYou went over there, and you're like, we'll figure it out.\n\n01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.400\nYeah, well, that's the same.\n\n01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.400\nIt's like what Rick says in the first episode of Rick and Morty.\n\n01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.400\nIt's just like that.\n\n01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:56.400\nYou throw yourself into situations that you don't fully understand,\n\n01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:00.400\nand then you grow as a person because you figure it out, or you don't.\n\n01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:04.400\nI know, but you could have gone to Barna, man.\n\n01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.400\nBut you went to, like, Burning if the shit is on fire.\n\n01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:11.400\nBomb the fuck out, man.\n\n01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.400\nLet's see another one.\n\n01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:16.400\nYou guys should see the song and dance routine they do at the end of this one.\n\n01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:19.400\nIt has dancing or something in there.\n\n01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.400\nThis is when they were...\n\n01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.400\nYeah, the dance number.\n\n01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.400\nHe gives a little speech first.\n\n01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.400\nWe probably don't need to go through the speech.\n\n01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:29.400\nIt's mostly about how they're sweet.\n\n01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:32.400\nYou want to pay attention, because we're going to see this guy again\n\n01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.400\nwith another clip to this dude.\n\n01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.400\nThis is going to be great for all the listeners.\n\n01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.400\nIs that guy have a pencil mustache?\n\n01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.400\nNo, they can't have beards, so they really get crazy.\n\n01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.400\nThe guys that had to shave their beards get big on the mustaches.\n\n01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.400\nThey're not allowed to have beards?\n\n01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.400\nThey didn't, because they look like ISIS.\n\n01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.400\nYeah, I got a lot of shit.\n\n01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.400\nBy the way, they thought he was ISIS every checkpoint.\n\n01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.400\nThey would be putting their hands on their guns, being like,\n\n01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:58.400\nDush, Dush, and it's going to be a while before the beard recovers in Iraq.\n\n01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:01.400\nThe beard is pretty tough there.\n\n01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.400\nThe anti-silver lake over there.\n\n01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:06.400\nSo this guy is the colonel who's in charge of that position,\n\n01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.400\nand his job is like, in the evenings and the afternoon,\n\n01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:13.400\nhe kills ISIS guys, and in the morning, he leads journalists on a tour.\n\n01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:17.400\nAnd that dude behind him is like, you can watch his face during this,\n\n01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.400\nbecause it's really interesting.\n\n01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.400\nHe's like the guy who keeps everyone alive when they're running around.\n\n01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:24.400\nHe was always, whenever people were shooting at us or near shooting at us,\n\n01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:27.400\nthat dude always had his body between magenta and the bullets.\n\n01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.400\nHe's a really cool dude.\n\n01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:33.400\nAya de世界 Dickboarding.\n\n01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:34.400\nHe's flaming him.\n\n01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.400\nThe ISIS people are je Например aiz has came now.\n\n01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.400\nHe never afathled for it again.\n\n01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.400\nHe just faded away.\n\n01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:45.400\nI dint those two rzeczy.\n\n01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.900\nHonestly, he's saying\n\n01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.400\nPoultah!\n\n01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.400\nPoultah!\n\n01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.400\nWe can play football now?\n\n01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:58.400\nCan we start?\n\n01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:13.260\nWhat the fuck was that you said you dropped out and everybody applauded then you're like\n\n01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:18.780\noh he's saying that a thermal gang grenade is what the fuck what do you know you're smart\n\n01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:24.660\nyou're worldly you speak the other languages not mostly just badly it takes it takes a\n\n01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:33.760\nlot to be you and so we all are allowed to not be you of course I

01:33:01.580\nof that I speak a little bit of Kurdish but I my Arabic is terrible I know like eight words\n\n01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:07.020\nit's bad I would I would I would I would get off a plane over there and I would be afraid\n\n01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:11.820\nto use the word Arabic because I would be I would I would assume from what I've lived\n\n01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:18.260\nthrough I would someone go Arabic rude and I'd be like I don't know I don't know you\n\n01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:21.900\nwould you would you would be you'd be off the plane like ten minutes before someone\n\n01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:26.220\nwas like oh this guy clearly needs help I speak English come with me you want to crash\n\n01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:29.900\nand then I'd be like is he gonna rate

01:33:37.860\nthere was a pool guy that was like come do this fucking low-grade ayahuasca with me\n\n01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:42.500\nin my family's village and I spent the entire car ride going they're gonna rape us but\n\n01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:46.940\nthey didn't because everything different is a threat but okay so that's that's that's\n\n01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:51.300\nlike the thing that separates like before we ever went to a war zone we traveled a lot\n\n01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:54.700\nin parts of the world we're like we had experiences we're like you're in the car with the people\n\n01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:57.620\nthat you don't really understand they're like oh is something bad gonna happen is this like\n\n01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:01.540\nthe first 15 minutes of an Eli Roth movie and then we all get cut to pieces like it's\n\n01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:07.380\nsomething terrible and it doesn't always but when it doesn't happen five or six times\n\n01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:11.220\nin a row you're like thinking about that is like you are out doesn't exist but he does\n\n01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:22.460\nyeah but he's just he's just a mediocre director no but that yeah it doesn't matter he's he's\n\n01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:27.900\nprobably not that gifted a writer I don't think he'd disagree with that right his stories\n\n01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:34.460\nlargely have a first act of I'm so glad we're getting onto this subject that guy yeah I want\n\n01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:39.420\nto know what do we what do we need to know that we don't know like what do you see over\n\n01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:43.980\nthere that we might be getting the bullshit story on here's the thing that I do want to\n\n01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:48.340\nmake sure I talk about because I don't want to get off of it there's an anarchist feminist\n\n01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:53.540\nmilitia that are the people who are actually beating ISIS in Syria right now when when\n\n01:34:53.540 --> 01:35:00.180\nwe not surprised when you hear about them on the news you'll hear like the United States\n\n01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:05.380\ngovernment has increased its aid to the SDF the Syrian Democratic Forces 70 ish percent\n\n01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:09.780\nof the Syrian Democratic Forces are a group called the YPG the People's Protection Units\n\n01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:14.700\nthe YPG and their sister unit literally sister unit the YPG which is the female People's\n\n01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:19.420\nProtection Units okay they are when we went to Iraq the first time we started touring\n\n01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:22.860\nall these refugee camps where there were a bunch of Yazidis survivors of the genocide\n\n01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:27.380\nISIS carried out so these are people like I was asking about like oh hey America this\n\n01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:31.380\nis the only time that the US intervened in a timely manner to help stop a genocide like\n\n01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:34.940\never like ISIS started killing these people and we sent in air strikes and I expected\n\n01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:39.500\nthem to be like yeah we're really grateful to the United States for stopping ISIS none\n\n01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:44.180\nof them had that to say they were like no it was the YPG so what happened is during when\n\n01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:48.540\nISIS was on the move and they were expanding in Iraq and expanding in Syria and everybody\n\n01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:52.180\nwas running away the Iraqi army was fleeing from them the Kurdish military was fleeing\n\n01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:55.620\nfrom them all the different Syrian militias were fleeing from and they were they were\n\n01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:59.460\njust growing unchecked like a giant fucking tumor in the middle of all that they're mass\n\n01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:03.460\noccurring the members of this religious sect in Iraq called the Yazidis who live in Mount\n\n01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:09.140\nSinjar and the YPG who is again a feminist anarchist militia here's that that's happening\n\n01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:12.180\nthis is happening they're fighting their own desperate battle against ISIS and getting\n\n01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:17.540\npushed back and they divert divert forces from this battle for survival to invade Iraq\n\n01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:27.140\ndivert you fucking idiot he doesn't even know words this motherfucker just gave away\n\n01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:35.100\nto plot a wander woman so but so these guys these guys and ladies punch a hole in ISIS's\n\n01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:39.700\nlines in Iraq rescue tens of thousands of people avert a genocide and then leave forces\n\n01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:44.340\nbehind to train a militia and the only complaint that we heard the people we talked to there\n\n01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:48.820\nmake about them is that the Yazidis are a very traditional like traditional in the sense\n\n01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:53.140\nthat they don't let women do a lot and they were like well they wouldn't they forced our\n\n01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.980\nwomen to learn how to fight they gave them guns and we didn't want them to give our\n\n01:36:55.980 --> 01:37:00.940\nladies guns and now our women have guns and it's it's frustrating to us that sounds like\n\n01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:06.620\na like an indie movie they're like well you know it is what it is I this is going to sound\n\n01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:10.660\nlike a really loaded liberal question but do you think the reason we're not aware of\n\n01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:16.300\nthat very very marketable phenomenon that would make a really compelling story is you\n\n01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:21.300\nknow do you think that's being filtered out do you think that's a threat to the first\n\n01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:28.660\nworld the idea that women and the men who support them not in a chivalrous way but in\n\n01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:35.220\na fucking like like fuck it way like that that will be the solution like that that's\n\n01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:39.300\nthe last thing anyone wants to hear there's a lot to be scared of in that because like\n\n01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:44.740\nwhen when Rojava is one of the names you'll find them under they don't go by Rojava anymore\n\n01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:48.660\nthey're not a state it's like a democratic it's democracy without a state is the way\n\n01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:52.700\nyou'll hear it described a lot it's a weird system of government that's based around like\n\n01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:57.060\none of the things they do is they elect a man and a woman simultaneously to every political\n\n01:37:57.060 --> 01:38:01.060\nposition and they have to come to an accord before anything can get decided so it's like\n\n01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:06.940\nit is actually a perfect 5050 representation and in some of these towns when they took\n\n01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:11.460\nover from the Syrian government and they were like hey ladies like we have female organizations\n\n01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:15.660\nfor lady journalists we have female military units like we have female farming collectives\n\n01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:19.980\nlike you're free to have a job and do whatever you want participate in politics now there\n\n01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:24.500\nwere some areas where the divorce rate went to like 50% from almost nothing like half women\n\n01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:29.500\nthey're just left their husbands like oh shit I can go do stuff now well fuck this noise\n\n01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:34.180\nlike I'm gonna go do shit so yeah there's definitely an element of it that's it it's\n\n01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:38.620\na threat and there is a reason that you only hear to them referred to as the SDF rather\n\n01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:46.180\nthan a feminist anarchist militia who's rabidly against the idea of states yeah bad ass it's\n\n01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:53.260\nbad ass I wanted to make sure I got in my crazy left wing street I mean there was one\n\n01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:58.380\nquestion is there any pressure from your employers the media to show the Middle East and the\n\n01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:03.580\nspecific different light than you observe but I think that's I mean you're a freelancer\n\n01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:08.780\nI mean no I'm salaried with cracked but they don't pay for us to go we just buy plane tickets\n\n01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:19.460\nthey're like if you can find a bit I thought I don't know what's wrong with my tweet deck\n\n01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:27.020\nI thought I saw some shit that was like you know what tweet tweet deck I'm sweet dick but\n\n01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:32.780\nI always hear that I set up a little filter for the hashtag thing but just what do you\n\n01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:38.060\ngot anything we should know that we don't already know so much to know me give me your\n\n01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:47.300\ntop one as quickly as you possibly can I mean there's this one weird moment no no no god\n\n01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:54.620\ndamn it I am at a podium with a microphone and I asked you a question okay I just got\n\n01:39:54.620 --> 01:40:00.220\none thing to say for everyone here do all the shit that you just like talk about and\n\n01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:03.020\nthen you put it off you don't do it and it's just a fantasy just do it because that's what\n\n01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:07.100\nI did that's what we're doing just do the shit that you wanted to do and it sounds silly\n\n01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:14.380\njust worked away I was worth the weight I knew you had it in you girl I knew you had\n\n01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:20.460\nit in you we still want to know though I still want to know as a as a person who has who\n\n01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:27.620\nis three weeks into having decided to get back on the elliptical I still want to understand\n\n01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:32.460\nwhat it is that put me on it in the first place because I know once I was on it I wanted\n\n01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:37.020\nto stay on it and I know once I got off it it got easy to stay off it but I'm trying\n\n01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:43.180\nto isolate that moment so that we can bottle it put it in a little pill that's like take\n\n01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:48.540\naction because we all know this like we hear it all the time in our own heads and we hear\n\n01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:52.220\nit from the people we admire that they're like hey that thing that you want to do just\n\n01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:59.780\ndo it and it's like how you scared the first time you like wrote up a pilot or wrote with\n\n01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:03.700\nthe first thing that you wrote that you submitted to somebody you respected yeah I had a chance\n\n01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:09.060\nto turn it down it's almost like that the path that led me to where I am ego ego ego\n\n01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:15.460\nlike I was too fucking dumb to know how untalented I was well there you go great okay I played\n\n01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:20.700\na lot of D&D and watch Indiana Jones movies as a kid so that was that was everything I\n\n01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:25.140\nmean it's like it's like okay yeah but it's like it's it's it's something seems scary\n\n01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:29.900\nto someone or even beyond scary if it just seems like this isn't the time to do that\n\n01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:34.540\nI get fucking gotta go to work at Starbucks yeah I gotta go work or I gotta I gotta or\n\n01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:38.620\nit just yeah it's like I got to do shit yesterday and I gotta do shit tomorrow if I even have\n\n01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:44.780\na time to think right now then I owe it to myself to just sit here and think what in\n\n01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:49.060\nthat moment like yeah yeah I'm gonna answer my own question my fucking therapist answered\n\n01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:53.100\nit it's like this never leads anywhere thought doesn't lead to action only action leads to\n\n01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:57.660\naction you said it yourself you just have to do it even though it doesn't it vexes us\n\n01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:02.820\nbecause we're addicted to thought we have a luxury we have we're addicted to safety as\n\n01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:07.460\nwell we're addicted to just like we have the luxury of going that's what we do we're on\n\n01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:13.340\nKing's Landing so we go we can't we can make a difference when we go I'd like that funding\n\n01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:18.740\nto go over here and we mistake that for meaning that as individuals it's okay for us to go\n\n01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:27.220\nwell I've decided I'm a vegan or I've decided I'm left but right of this it's words and\n\n01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:32.900\nit's thoughts whereas the things that everybody in this room knows that all the shit that\n\n01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:38.060\nchanged them is shit that they just did we have so much support like if you're homeless\n\n01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:41.380\nin America you're still gonna have clean water you're still gonna find a toilet you're not\n\n01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:46.340\ngonna starve like you're in America so rely on the community or the culture that we don't\n\n01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:51.220\nhave and miss that week of work even if you get fired to pursue what you want to do because\n\n01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:54.140\nyou're still at the end of the day gonna have a clean place to shit and at least you're\n\n01:42:54.140 --> 01:43:00.900\na step closer to trying something different you're gonna have a clean place to shit no\n\n01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:05.020\nmatter what you're in America it's fine just try some shit I can definitely but to the\n\n01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:08.700\nextent that logic is employed there I can twist that into like okay yeah so I should\n\n01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:13.300\nstay put and like I'm doing great yeah you are you are doing great so I'm not gonna do\n\n01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:16.740\nanything different tomorrow because even if I'm homeless I can shit in a clean no one\n\n01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:21.540\nmakes you happy fuck you guys don't high road me no one's telling me to do anything\n\n01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:26.300\ndifferent we all want

dropped\n\n01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:39.140\nit and I hitched to ride on his U-Haul I've taught you guys I'm golem like I like a ring\n\n01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:47.180\nfell near me and I was like this is precious and then one day it fell away with no matter\n\n01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:51.140\nwhere it fought that's when I move I go well this is less precious I want the precious\n\n01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:56.940\nback like that's all I've ever done that's all I do okay you got it well who doesn't\n\n01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:02.300\nthat describe that doesn't describe you you fucking yeah well it's a whole planet of\n\n01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:07.460\ngolem that's the whole that's not golem when you go to the Middle East golem never goes\n\n01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:14.220\nto the Middle East I mean there's kids that are starving and then you go have some fancy\n\n01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:17.620\nfucking meal at night every night when you're out there like a shit head doing that you're\n\n01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:22.140\njust doubling down on the golem would never do that you'd be like no those kids make me\n\n01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:27.420\nuncomfortable I'm gonna go eat fish in a cave those kids don't have any fish Dan the golem\n\n01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:30.660\ndoesn't care he doesn't want to think about that he wants his precious to think about\n\n01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:35.620\nit we all want our precious no you want photo journalism yeah but that's not feeding the\n\n01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:44.340\nkids that you see over there that's not bad is that place that golems in the middle earth\n\n01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:49.620\nthat's just the goblins mountain golem the worst place is that golem hangs out and mortar\n\n01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:57.460\nbecause that's where he found a comfortable place all right look let's Annie let's just\n\n01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:04.340\naccept that we're all we're all equidistant from transformative human evolution so you\n\n01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:09.500\nguys really aren't that much better than me well why is there not there's real see what\n\n01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:16.420\nabout this and I learned earlier I'm just like John Sweden because I don't make a community\n\n01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:24.820\nmovie I'm fucking nailing it no sorry I it's not like skydivers are better you're not like\n\n01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:29.900\nyelling at skydivers are you just like that's what gets them off I silently judge skydivers\n\n01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:35.740\nI do well why because they needlessly risk death in a world where life is precious that's\n\n01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:42.220\nwhere I find them atrocious people well nobody needs us but you go on roller coasters yeah\n\n01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:50.500\nat least I don't I do it so that my friends don't judge me I'm judging you can I say\n\n01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:54.700\nsomething man I think one thing is that it's about bravery a little bit it's a kind of\n\n01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:59.140\nabout doing good work you know that's what they're doing that's what I know you aspire\n\n01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:03.020\nto do that's like kind of part of your problem is you want to be good at what you do to be\n\n01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:08.500\nglorified well maybe but you also really like know it's edifying for people I mean these\n\n01:46:08.500 -->
