00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
You can be louder than that if you want to, and now, the mayor of the city of New York.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
The mayor of Harmontown, Den Harbour!

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Thank you.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
You're very, very kind.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Thank you.

00:41.000 --> 01:02.000
You know, it's our new home. If you're here for the third time, you see there's an evolution taking place. You should be honored to be part of it. You should be honored to be waiting for things. Why is he still looking at his phone if there's an evolution? Why can't he? Because the future hasn't happened. I don't have a fucking...

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
You should put your phone notes on the screen behind you.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Well, the people can just see... Exactly. Okay.

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
It'll speed things up.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
What have I done?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I mean, this isn't really what I... Okay.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
It's a bit of a nature video right now.

01:28.000 --> 01:38.000
I mean, I don't even know... You don't even know... Okay. No, this is stupid. Let me just... It doesn't matter, because I'm not going to talk that much, and then I'm going to bring up...

01:38.000 --> 01:51.000
Because we have a show chock full of entertainment, and you guys are so lucky to be here, and you're... Yeah, you're plotting your own good fortune.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
That's a great thing to apply.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
That's what people should apply. Like, I mean, gone are the days when you would applaud the entertainment itself.

02:01.000 --> 02:10.000
Now you just applaud your own privilege and just go, like, we are lucky to be here. I was told that by the fake news.

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
So here's the thing. All right. Let me just try to blow through some stuff that deserves more than being blown through.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
I'm drunk. I came up drunk. I usually get drunk during the show.

02:23.000 --> 02:33.000
Because I was with my friend Joel Hodgson, who was celebrating with his Kickstarter supporters, the Mystery Science Theater accomplishment that happened on Kickstarter.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
So many funny people attached.

02:35.000 --> 02:47.000
And I was dragged out and whored off to no offense to whores. But I had a great time, because you're just surrounded with people.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
It's like, what? I got to hold court. That's what they call it. I held court.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
Talking to people that have no choice but to stop talking when I interrupt them.

02:56.000 --> 03:06.000
Well, I'm interested in this video game. Yeah, here's the thing about video games. Okay, dance talking. I thought this game is better than this one.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Well, you're a fat, rich windbag, so I guess that's true.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
But we talked about so much stuff that I feel like I don't really have much show in me.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
So I think we'll try to get it.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah, here we go.

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
So we weren't here last week, because I went on vacation. It was my girlfriend's birthday. I went to Tulum, Mexico, the most amazing place in the world.

03:30.000 --> 03:38.000
It doesn't need my help. It's already beautiful. It's monetized. It's fine. But it's gorgeous there.

03:38.000 --> 03:48.000
And I got high on the beach, and Cody went to get a drink, and here's what happened to me. Here's why I'm now going to be a perfect person.

03:48.000 --> 03:59.000
First of all, it all starts with Trump, because we're all feeling the same thing, which is that we're all now living in a new space where we're like, no wrong answers.

03:59.000 --> 04:13.000
Which is not just a glib thing to say. It's true that we were living in a world where we were wondering if we were drinking too much coffee, or if we were saving enough for our retirement, or if our mortgage payments meant this, or should I have kids, or should I have kids?

04:13.000 --> 04:22.000
What's my favorite color? And then a rapist Nazi became president, and he did it by tweeting horrible things. He didn't do it by tricking anyone.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
He just went like, I'm a rapist Nazi, and everyone went, well, sometimes that's better than a woman. Yay!

04:28.000 --> 04:39.000
And our nightmare just marched forward. And all of the walls came down, and I'm not saying it's a good thing, and I'm not saying we needed that to happen,

04:39.000 --> 04:51.000
but I am saying that at least we can find the positivity in that when it's like, when your paradigm shatters, you are on the verge of new epiphanies that don't have to do with how much coffee you're drinking.

04:51.000 --> 05:03.000
You have no choice now, but to get up every morning and think about God, and whether he exists, whether he's a she, you're out of shit, you're an idiot if you're thinking about coffee.

05:03.000 --> 05:21.000
There's a fucking Nazi in the White House. So anyways, is he affecting it now? Is he affecting the thing? No, he's not. He has a problem.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
He can't speak. He's not a professional entertainer. He gets wound up.

05:28.000 --> 05:46.000
I was on a daybed overlooking the beautiful Tulum ocean. I got high, Cody went to go get drinks, and I started doing this thing that I do when I'm happy, which is I go back over my life and I torture myself.

05:46.000 --> 05:58.000
I don't think this is just a Midwest thing, but there's such a fine line between gratitude and I'm about to get cancer, because gratitude means I have it so good.

05:58.000 --> 06:07.000
Oh, I should really appreciate how good I have it. To me, being from Wisconsin, that is identical to saying I'm about to get cancer.

06:07.000 --> 06:22.000
And it's also identical to saying, oh, I don't deserve this because I've been such a piece of shit. And so I'm just sitting there looking over the ocean and I'm going back over my life because my girlfriend's gone and I can't hold her hand anymore and I can't be distracted by these things that slow me down as my therapist says,

06:22.000 --> 06:31.000
run on your engine, not on the pistons. So I start running on the pistons, and I'm going back over my life. And I'm going, well, why did Sarah Silverman fire you?

06:31.000 --> 06:45.000
Well, because you're a fucking idiot because you did this. Why did you do that with Chevy Chase? Why did you get fired from community? Why couldn't you just tow the line at Kung Fu Panda?

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
How many times have we all said that?

06:50.000 --> 07:06.000
Well, for most people, it's code. And so normally that's an exercise of just like, oh, you're out of the moment, you're fucked up, now you were happy, so you went back through your life and now you're torturing yourself.

07:06.000 --> 07:24.000
But I followed through on it and I was like, okay, so there's a version of me that didn't get fired, Season 4 community, there's a version of me that didn't fuck up, that knew better on the Sarah Silverman show. There's a version of me that was like, knew while working on Kung Fu Panda that no one cares about story structure.

07:24.000 --> 07:48.000
They don't know that if a panda is born entitled to win, that that makes him a villain. It doesn't matter. I made different choices. I swiped a laminate at DreamWorks the animation and went to work every day and went, you know your movie's shitty, right?

07:48.000 --> 07:56.000
And they kept going like, well, it's probably gonna be pretty good. And I kept going, these guys don't know what they're talking about.

07:56.000 --> 08:09.000
So anyways, suffice to say, I have regrets. I could have serviced the fans better. Season 4 community, if I hadn't had a fucking meltdown, if I hadn't taken myself so seriously.

08:09.000 --> 08:19.000
So I'm going over all of these decisions every fucking moment, but here's what happens. So I go, okay, so there's that version of me, there's that version of me, there's that version of me.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
So that guy's got more money, that guy's working on a better show, that guy transitioned, he's a woman now, you're welcome.

08:26.000 --> 08:42.000
Like whatever, all of the choices I could have made. And I'm like, okay, so all of you guys, what do you want? What are you going for?

08:42.000 --> 08:49.000
One of you has a Tesla, one of you has Spielberg and your Rolodex, there was these things called Rolodexes.

08:49.000 --> 08:56.000
What do all of you want? And then I was like, I think all of them want to be on a beach in Tulum.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
And then my girlfriend came in and I was like, holy shit, that's my girlfriend.

09:00.000 --> 09:07.000
And I was like, whoa, and I was like, oh, it is a simulation, it's a simulation, I'm in a cutscene.

09:07.000 --> 09:22.000
Because it's a sandbox open world game, but then there's a braiding point, because it doesn't matter what you do in a good game, you come to a point where the designer said,

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
yeah, but then you end up at this specific point where you sit on a beach and you go, this is who I am.

09:30.000 --> 09:39.000
And the women know this is sliding doors that I'm describing. Maybe not the women in our audience.

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
But that's what I'm saying. It was an epiphany, I don't care if you understand it.

09:46.000 --> 09:52.000
There's no way to react to an epiphany that registers to me as I nailed my epiphany.

09:52.000 --> 09:59.000
You were saying that you had so much fucking fun, you had some broke flashbacks to when life was rough.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
Well, that's also true. Well, no, here's what you know, I am broke right now, or I was broke for a little bit.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
Like my checking balance was so low that I was like feeling middle class.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Ew, disgusting.

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
Not one, but two of my assistants had to take me aside and warn me that my checking account balance was so low.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Do you know how that feels?

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
I was just trying to mitigate Steve a little bit.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
They don't do that unless they're worried they're not going to get paid.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I was like, why did you take me aside?

10:35.000 --> 10:42.000
They're like, because you were in front of the electronics guy who was like installing shit in your house and he might stop.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
But you know, whatever, and then a check came in. Let's not get distracted.

10:48.000 --> 10:56.000
Like, here's the thing. But it's not the thing. I'm tired of saying here's the thing. I don't know the thing.

10:56.000 --> 11:04.000
I, it, like, I, I'm, like, okay.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
So, like, like, if you, here's what I realized.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
I started going, okay, so let's say Elon Musk is right. And it's an, I know it's not his idea, but that we're a simulation.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
So we're playing a game.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
Okay, so all games are based on deprivation of something like you spin a kid around.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
Oh, they don't know how to stand. Wouldn't it be funny if they pinned a tail on something?

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
There's no party game where you give the kid a tail and a donkey with a tail slot and you go like, well, good.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So you're, you're not an idiot.

11:38.000 --> 11:46.000
We, we purposely deprive people of things. We put boxes on our heads and we watch each other in turn like flounder around.

11:46.000 --> 11:54.000
So if, if, if, if life is a simulation, like, what if it's a party game? What if we're each taking turns and what if, what if, what if, knock it off?

11:54.000 --> 12:02.000
You piece of shit. You fucking impoverished piece of garbage you.

12:02.000 --> 12:10.000
What did I do wrong to let you in here? See, I, I lost it.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
In those moments when you video game, yes, thank you.

12:16.000 --> 12:32.000
When you're sad, when you're in love, when you've been dumped, when you're angry, when you're feeling racist, when you're feeling angry, when you're, when you're too tall, when you're too short, when you're, when you're having these heightened experiences.

12:32.000 --> 12:43.000
If you imagine that it's a bit, how, how can I imagine that my crippling pain is a bit, Dan? My healthcare just got gutted.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Well, okay, I'll get to you in a second.

12:47.000 --> 12:57.000
There are people, if you imagine philosophically, and this is something that even an atheist can imagine without violating your atheism, because it's not an actual religion, it's just a philosophy.

12:57.000 --> 13:06.000
Just imagine a party full of people watching you with a box on your head going, look at them. Look at them go.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Oh shit, he's onto us. He's onto it.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
Like when you look into the eyes of your lover and you go like, this is where I, this is, this is it. This is where I'm meant to be.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
And then they go like, oh, but they're also not mad at you for blowing it.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Like if you're just jerking off and playing Minecraft for three days, they're, they're not like, he's losing.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
Like it's, there's no wrong way to do it. It's like one of those, like it's a party game.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
I just wanted to get that out. I don't care. You're too dumb to get it.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
That's not true.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
It's like Roy and Rick and Morty.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
It's exactly like that.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
No, I know, I know it's not a new concept or it's not something that we haven't explored already.

13:47.000 --> 13:55.000
The emotional epiphany is just the imagination that like instead of Rick watching you play Roy, what if it was like people you loved?

13:55.000 --> 14:03.000
What if every time I look at Spencer, like either Spencer's an AI that's like designed to pull certain behaviors out of me,

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
or Spencer is like, represents an octopus Spencer that's like, like part of my species.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
But in either case, like I can look at Spencer and go like, I get it.

14:13.000 --> 14:21.000
Like it's just a, we're just fucking around. And then you just, you can hear like a choir of octopus angels going, yay.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
I don't know. I give up. I give up.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
We have a lot of show. I'm sorry.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Well, you'll figure it out. Don't know.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
No.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Oh yeah.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
No.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Yes.

14:34.000 --> 14:42.000
Oh yeah. You deserve it because you literally went away, came back so happy, you didn't even know what the fuck to talk about.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I had a good vacation.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Yeah.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Don't patronize me.

14:48.000 --> 14:56.000
And that is all right. You ain't got to feel bad about that.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I saw get out.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
Awesome.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Yeah.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It was good. It's a pretty good movie.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
All right. We got a lot of show solicitors.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
It was a really good movie.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
We were just talking about it over there while we were waiting to come out.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
So I'm all talked out about get out.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
But you've already seen it.

15:19.000 --> 15:28.000
Our next guest created Mystery Science Theater 3000.

15:28.000 --> 15:35.000
Joel Hodgson is here.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Hi Joel. Sorry.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Hey y'all.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
Okay. Take me up, Dan.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Sorry I took so long.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
That's okay. Show me what you're seeing tonight. Let's go.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
What? What do you mean?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
What's going on in your heart?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Oh, oh, oh.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Oh wait. You just did that.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah, I did.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
You did that? Okay.

15:57.000 --> 16:05.000
Yeah. So, I mean, the reason we were together tonight is because you've recently resurrected MST.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
Thank you.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
And you did it through crowdfunding.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
And what is it on Netflix?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
What's the...

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
It's on Netflix. Yeah.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
There's 14 new Mystery Science theaters.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
And they're all just dumped out there.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
You can just watch them.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
They're right. Yeah.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
They came out like three or four weeks ago.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
All right.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I didn't feel like...

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I don't think any of my jokes got used.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Yeah.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Reptileberry Cherry Sores is yours.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Absolutely.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I don't like my voice.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
I did it like a lot of funny...

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
I honestly deliberately didn't look at who wrote what, so I didn't want to get into this.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Well, as long as the fans are happy.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
I think so.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I meant a lot that you got involved, man.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
It got a lot of press.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
You were really like...

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I don't know who would really know this.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
I don't know if you know this.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.000
Like when I moved from Milwaukee to Los Angeles, even before I did, because we met at Comic-Con,

17:02.000 --> 17:11.000
like when I was selling comic books, you were a person that I recognized from television

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
that Schrab and I, therefore, when we...

17:13.000 --> 17:20.360
You were so nice to us, treated us like equals, and therefore, when we moved to L.A., we had

17:20.360 --> 17:24.400
your number and were hanging out with you, and you were still treating us like equals

17:24.400 --> 17:31.000
and kind of mentoring us because we were from the Midwest moving to this weird city and

17:31.000 --> 17:39.000
you were also from the Midwest and had been there a little longer and were truly...

17:39.000 --> 17:49.000
The stuff that you told us probably definitely helped a lot.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Just the idea of like, everyone out here is a fucking idiot, man.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Wait a minute, you're doing...

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
You really got to accept that.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
You're like, shit, like the secret to happiness is like the day you wake up and you're like,

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
holy shit, everyone's fucking dumb.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
You might be embellishing there, I'm not sure.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Yeah, I remember that lesson.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Well, you guys were adorable, man.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
When I met you and Schrab, I just, you know, had to be friends.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
You guys were great.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
I got just as much from you guys as you got from me.

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
I want to talk about crowdfunding because you just did this thing and we did crowdfunding

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
with Anomaly, so we worked with Kickstarter.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
There's actually, you have a friend here who, he's more qualified to talk about it.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Yeah.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Could we do a Kickstarter for me to remember his name?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
His name is Ivan Asquith.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Let's bring him up.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
Before we do, I want to just kind of prep the audience for him.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
He has a mole on his forehead that's like the size of a basket.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
If you look at it, he flips out.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
It's not fun.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
That's why he got into Kickstarter.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
But Ivan has so much to do with the success of our Kickstarter.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.000
I worked with him every day on it and he really helped me so much in understanding how to

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
work with a, you know, we had 50,000 backers and we gave them updates almost on a weekly

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
level and he was, we collaborated together and how to talk to them and how to keep them

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
abreast of what we were working on with MST and he's just probably, he's writing the book

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
on how to do this.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
He's an expert on it.

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
And he's, aside from doing our Kickstarter campaign, he's responsible for all the other

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
top Kickstarter campaigns like Veronica Mars and Reading Rainbow and Super Troopers 2.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
So he's really an expert at it.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
So it's Ivan Asquith.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
You want to come on up, Ivan?

19:40.000 --> 19:53.000
See, I'm doing it Carson style where I move down and then he moves over.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
You told them about the mole on my phone.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Yeah, sorry.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
It's weird.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Go ahead, just flash it.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Yeah.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I just think it's weird.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
There's no mole, you idiots.

20:03.000 --> 20:11.000
I mean, it unavoidably sounds like a weird keynote, like we're at some Silicon Valley company

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
now, like introducing you because you didn't create Batman or like design the Rainbow and

20:16.000 --> 20:25.000
Reading Rainbow, but you've figured out in an emerging age, you're a piece of shit.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.280
You're a spontaneously evolved person in a new food chain that hasn't had time to become

20:30.280 --> 20:35.320
old, which is like crowdfunding, there's a tightrope here.

20:35.320 --> 20:40.440
We did a Kickstarter with Anomalysa and I'll be the first to admit, we didn't know what

20:40.440 --> 20:41.440
we were doing.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.080
We fucked up in a lot of ways.

20:43.080 --> 20:48.200
You need to update and all this stuff, but how much are you allowed to talk about the

20:48.200 --> 20:53.040
Zach Braf thing, not to throw him under the bus and shit on him, but to talk about him

20:53.040 --> 20:59.720
is like a milestone of crowdfunding where the consciousness had to change.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.720
You know what?

21:00.720 --> 21:03.920
I think it's easier to just get him to talk about his world view, like how he looks at

21:03.920 --> 21:04.920
it rather than using Zach Braf.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.480
Joel's going to take all my questions for me.

21:06.480 --> 21:10.360
Yeah, but I just, I want you to do that and then you can come back around to it if you

21:10.360 --> 21:11.360
want to.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.360
I just, I can come back around to it.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.360
I think it's the Zach Braf thing.

21:15.360 --> 21:22.080
Oh no, okay, yeah, look, look, pretend I never said anything, but if I didn't say anything,

21:22.080 --> 21:24.280
it's not like you just start talking.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.880
You have to be, yeah, something has to be said to you.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.400
He can start talking at the drop of a hat, believe me.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.400
What's that?

21:31.400 --> 21:32.880
He can talk at the drop of a hat.

21:32.880 --> 21:33.880
He's ready to let go.

21:33.880 --> 21:34.880
Let's go ahead and get that started.

21:34.880 --> 21:35.880
This is weird for anybody else.

21:35.880 --> 21:36.880
Just me.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.280
I guess we'll start with Zach Braf and then we'll work our way back around.

21:40.280 --> 21:43.240
No, don't, don't, no, we're going to come around to Zach Braf.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.680
So in like 1960s, Zach Braf was born.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.680
Awesome.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.680
I think we've covered that.

21:47.680 --> 21:48.680
Now let's just see what you do.

21:48.680 --> 21:54.800
Joel's theory is that it's okay for you to just start talking about your world view.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.880
And I'd like you to do that just to prove him wrong.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.960
You'd like me to do it to prove him wrong or right?

22:00.960 --> 22:02.120
Well, no, prove him right.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.120
Oh, right.

22:03.120 --> 22:06.040
Make that your goal.

22:06.040 --> 22:09.800
My speculation is you will prove him wrong.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.720
My world view or my crowd world view?

22:11.720 --> 22:12.720
Just start talking about your world view.

22:12.720 --> 22:13.720
Explain your world view.

22:13.720 --> 22:14.720
Explain your world view.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.720
Explain your world view.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.720
That's how all good interviews start.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.720
So in the beginning, there was Dan Harmon.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.240
Is that what I'm supposed to...

22:23.240 --> 22:24.240
That's your world view?

22:24.240 --> 22:25.240
Yeah.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.240
He told me at dinner that he's...

22:26.240 --> 22:28.440
How does that relate to the Zach Braf thing?

22:28.440 --> 22:36.960
Get the Zach Braf thing out of the way because it's really fucking up Dan.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.800
So what was the question?

22:38.800 --> 22:39.800
World view.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.800
World view.

22:40.800 --> 22:41.800
Was Zach Braf's world view?

22:41.800 --> 22:42.800
No.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.640
What's your world view?

22:44.640 --> 22:45.640
That's a big question.

22:45.640 --> 22:46.640
It is.

22:46.640 --> 22:47.640
Okay.

22:47.640 --> 22:48.640
Well, then let me...

22:48.640 --> 22:49.640
Joel was wrong.

22:49.640 --> 22:50.640
Is that what you want me to say?

22:50.640 --> 22:51.640
Yes.

22:51.640 --> 22:52.640
Thank you.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.640
Joel was wrong.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.240
I can make money so I can make something.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.240
Nope.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.240
Right.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.560
So explain the new...

22:59.560 --> 23:01.520
What's the nuance that we learned there?

23:01.520 --> 23:02.520
So the...

23:02.520 --> 23:06.080
I think the big misconception on Kickstarter is that people are giving money because they

23:06.080 --> 23:08.360
want to do somebody a favor and it's not.

23:08.360 --> 23:12.400
Usually, if it's going well, people feel like you're doing them a favor by making this thing

23:12.400 --> 23:13.760
possible that they want.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.360
Like, I think...

23:15.360 --> 23:18.320
So I had a conversation with Zach Braf's team when they were in the middle of their

23:18.320 --> 23:19.320
campaign.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.440
I had a much weirder conversation with like Lee's team.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.440
That's interesting.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.960
They're Braf's people.

23:23.960 --> 23:24.960
Yeah.

23:24.960 --> 23:25.960
Well, I...

23:25.960 --> 23:26.960
It was.

23:26.960 --> 23:27.960
We talked about my world view.

23:27.960 --> 23:28.960
Mostly.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.960
So you can ask him what it is if you ever have him on.

23:31.960 --> 23:32.960
No.

23:32.960 --> 23:33.960
I mean, I think the...

23:33.960 --> 23:38.560
I was telling you just before we came up that maybe his fault, maybe not, but Zach

23:38.560 --> 23:41.480
Braf's campaign is kind of like the cautionary tale for people now.

23:41.480 --> 23:45.440
Not just because he was like one of the first people to come on and he came just after Veronica

23:45.440 --> 23:48.920
Mars, which was a weird moment for everybody because Kickstarter's kind of seen as this

23:48.920 --> 23:52.800
space where like people who have no resources can suddenly make a good pitch to everybody

23:52.800 --> 23:55.000
and see if they want to give them some resources.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.520
And instead, Veronica Mars is this thing owned by Warner Brothers who have a decent

23:58.520 --> 24:01.840
number of resources, usually.

24:01.840 --> 24:06.280
And people were like, why the fuck is Kickstarter asking or why is Warner Brothers asking people

24:06.280 --> 24:08.720
to give money for this thing that they could easily fund.

24:08.720 --> 24:13.160
So right after that succeeded, Zach Braf was kind of like next out the gate and the problem

24:13.160 --> 24:17.640
was he didn't have a very good explanation in most people's opinion for why he was asking

24:17.640 --> 24:21.000
for money when it was really clear on like Scrub's fuck you money that he could have

24:21.000 --> 24:24.880
just funded the entire thing himself on one episode salary, or at least that was what

24:24.880 --> 24:26.880
everybody thought.

24:26.880 --> 24:30.400
And it got worse after he actually got the money.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.360
He got what he was looking for.

24:32.360 --> 24:36.200
And then it started getting worse for him because the main argument for why he wanted

24:36.200 --> 24:39.320
money was he wanted creative freedom and people were like, but you have your own money, that

24:39.320 --> 24:41.560
is creative freedom.

24:41.560 --> 24:46.600
And he used everybody else's money, but then as I was telling you, the thing started to

24:46.600 --> 24:50.440
go sour when the first update that he sent everybody, you know, to tell them how much

24:50.440 --> 24:54.520
he appreciated the money that he really needed from them, was on a GoPro video shot on the

24:54.520 --> 25:00.360
back of his jet ski, with like a cool hit indie soundtrack.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.440
I'm not even kidding.

25:01.440 --> 25:06.160
And then the second one was a little better, it was a GoPro from the back of a motorcycle.

25:06.160 --> 25:07.720
Still not kidding.

25:07.720 --> 25:12.920
But you know, and I think the kind of really bad moment for him was that he, I think he

25:12.920 --> 25:15.840
thought of it just like every other project he had gotten funded, he's like, I have the

25:15.840 --> 25:16.840
money now.

25:16.840 --> 25:17.840
Now it's my thing.

25:17.840 --> 25:18.840
I do what I want with it.

25:18.840 --> 25:22.400
And there wasn't necessarily a clear sense that he owed all these people who had given

25:22.400 --> 25:23.400
five.

25:23.400 --> 25:28.480
Basically what you're doing is you're breaking up the five people who normally are paid by

25:28.480 --> 25:30.040
a corporation.

25:30.040 --> 25:34.640
These fat cats, you're breaking them up into possibly hundreds of thousands of people and

25:34.640 --> 25:37.560
that collectively they're now your Weinstein.

25:37.560 --> 25:43.120
You actually work for them and you owe them these updates and you owe them for granted

25:43.120 --> 25:44.120
is like the problem, right?

25:44.120 --> 25:46.920
And I think people don't necessarily, it's misleading to think that people mostly care

25:46.920 --> 25:47.920
about the rewards.

25:47.920 --> 25:51.720
What they mostly care about is not being treated like they're a nuisance to you after they

25:51.720 --> 25:53.520
made this thing possible.

25:53.520 --> 25:59.880
So in his case, the like really bad moment was at Sundance when Wish I Was Here premiered

25:59.880 --> 26:04.400
and not only were his backers not given a heads up that it was going to be premiering, but

26:04.400 --> 26:07.320
I think the New York Times got a photo of one of his backers who had given a couple thousand

26:07.320 --> 26:10.400
dollars standing in front of the theater because they hadn't been able to get a ticket, holding

26:10.400 --> 26:14.480
up a cardboard sign like a homeless person saying, backer from Kickstarter will pay for

26:14.480 --> 26:16.680
tickets to my own movie.

26:16.680 --> 26:17.680
And yeah, it didn't go over well.

26:17.680 --> 26:23.200
I'm sure there's probably people in this audience with some, there's got to be with

26:23.200 --> 26:24.200
anomalies.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.720
You actually took over for anomalies.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.220
We got called to the tail.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.000
Can we talk about his world view now?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Okay.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Just get that out of the way.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.040
All right, but I'm telling you while you were in the bathroom, I checked in on his world

26:36.040 --> 26:37.040
view.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.040
He is so racist.

26:38.040 --> 26:41.040
But I saw, I saw it get out.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.200
It's one of the new racists.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.800
It's like a nineties band.

26:45.800 --> 26:46.800
Yeah.

26:46.800 --> 26:53.680
But you, that's the interesting thing about you is you, by the way, you don't work for

26:53.680 --> 26:54.680
Kickstarter.

26:54.680 --> 26:55.680
No.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.680
You're kind of a freelancer.

26:56.680 --> 27:01.320
That's what's interesting to me is that, that's the healthy part of capitalism is that

27:01.320 --> 27:06.640
crowd sourcing popped up, which is vastly superior in my opinion.

27:06.640 --> 27:11.240
What about ethics and karma and like, Oh, give the people their TV and movies.

27:11.240 --> 27:16.720
It's just more efficient to say to people, Hey, I'm thinking of making a night writer

27:16.720 --> 27:19.320
reboot.

27:19.320 --> 27:24.520
I need $5 million to do what I have in mind.

27:24.520 --> 27:31.520
If enough people and only if enough people are so interested in it that they can pledge

27:31.520 --> 27:36.120
the money in advance to see it, then I can make it.

27:36.120 --> 27:39.160
Well, this is, I mean, that's the amazing thing about the studio system, right?

27:39.160 --> 27:41.520
Like everyone racks their brains and worries about getting fired because they're like,

27:41.520 --> 27:43.160
How do we figure out what the audience likes?

27:43.160 --> 27:46.960
Nobody knows what the audience likes, except of course the audience, if you just ask them.

27:46.960 --> 27:47.960
Right.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.440
Which you now can with it by clicking it and, and, and, right.

27:50.440 --> 27:53.160
You can find out whether anybody would want to show up for the thing that you want to

27:53.160 --> 27:54.160
make.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.160
And if they don't, you don't have to waste your time on it.

27:55.160 --> 27:58.600
I mean, this is what you were saying, you know, before earlier this evening is it's

27:58.600 --> 27:59.600
nice.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.640
It's not that you're begging people for money, which is what some people think it is.

28:02.640 --> 28:06.560
That you're finding out before you put two years of your life into doing a new project,

28:06.560 --> 28:08.600
whether anybody gives a fuck about that project.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
Right.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.680
It's also good creatively too, because you have to build board a few ideas.

28:12.680 --> 28:17.280
So I think it, it's actually helped me kind of like put forward what are the new things

28:17.280 --> 28:21.240
in MST or what, what can I show you about it?

28:21.240 --> 28:23.360
That's kind of an innovation or a feature.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.760
Well, because we're kind of spoiled.

28:24.760 --> 28:29.560
We do, we're coming from a world where like those are the suits and like it's easy for

28:29.560 --> 28:34.280
us to look at them as mommy and daddy and we're creative and if only I could have, if

28:34.280 --> 28:39.360
you would just let me stop doing math homework and start doing this thing that I really want

28:39.360 --> 28:41.080
to do, then I'd do it.

28:41.080 --> 28:45.400
But the truth is, yeah, no one wants to write an outline.

28:45.400 --> 28:48.320
No one wants to figure out what the fuck you're going to do.

28:48.320 --> 28:53.960
And it's, it is that I, that's, I didn't want to throw BRAF under the bus.

28:53.960 --> 28:59.520
I wanted to use him as a, I think that was an interesting thing that we went through

28:59.520 --> 29:04.360
all those years ago where it was like, oh Kickstarter started and it was like, oh, this

29:04.360 --> 29:09.120
guy doesn't have a finger and he wants to come up with a prosthetic finger that all

29:09.120 --> 29:12.920
the prosthetic companies won't allow him to make.

29:12.920 --> 29:13.920
Can I have money?

29:13.920 --> 29:17.440
And it was easy to think of it as like, oh, that's what crowdfunding is.

29:17.440 --> 29:22.920
It's us revolting against the system and funding things that couldn't exist otherwise.

29:22.920 --> 29:26.360
And see, that's, that's, if you want like the closest thing I have to a worldview, because

29:26.360 --> 29:27.560
I don't have a worldview.

29:27.560 --> 29:30.880
But I have a view on like- Just say it's your worldview and let's move on.

29:30.880 --> 29:34.880
So my worldview is basically that like, in this space, the thing that interests me about

29:34.880 --> 29:35.880
it is not the money.

29:35.880 --> 29:39.360
Like the money's the least interesting part of crowdfunding and I get kind of like itchy

29:39.360 --> 29:43.000
and pissed off when people are like, oh, that guy's a crowdfunding guru.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.480
Which is what Joel and I makes a point of telling everybody when he introduces me to

29:45.480 --> 29:46.480
them.

29:46.480 --> 29:49.320
Because to me, the like, the money isn't the interesting part, the, the fact that the

29:49.320 --> 29:53.760
crowd at large has the chance to say, this is what we want and we're tired of people ignoring

29:53.760 --> 29:56.760
us when we say we'd rather, you know, it's the, it's the Futurama meme.

29:56.760 --> 29:57.760
Like shut up and take my money.

29:57.760 --> 29:58.760
Yeah.

29:58.760 --> 30:03.600
Well, because the, the, the people that, capitalism and populism are, it's not like they're removed

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
from each other.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.640
It's not like people that want to make money are constantly going, oh, what all those people

30:07.640 --> 30:09.160
want is so disgusting to me.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.160
They use it.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.160
They throw it in the face of people.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.960
They go, well, the people wanted it.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.560
So it's like, just connect those wires, whatever.

30:16.560 --> 30:19.600
Why am I explaining this to a nation of people that already know?

30:19.600 --> 30:20.600
All right.

30:20.600 --> 30:25.360
So your worldview is basically like, I know you voted for Trump.

30:25.360 --> 30:32.200
You explained to me, it's part of being a racist.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.560
We have cards that instruct us.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.640
We have limited chairs.

30:35.640 --> 30:39.360
Is there anything that, because I want to bring up our actual guests.

30:39.360 --> 30:47.320
I want, I want Joel to stay because I value his, his disruption, the, the, but, but you

30:47.320 --> 30:49.280
I'm going to trade for other people.

30:49.280 --> 30:53.640
So I, it's, it's okay.

30:53.640 --> 30:54.640
He can take it.

30:54.640 --> 30:55.640
It's a simulation.

30:55.640 --> 30:56.640
So it's totally.

30:56.640 --> 30:57.640
It doesn't matter.

30:57.640 --> 30:58.640
Yeah.

30:58.640 --> 30:59.640
It's, it's fun.

30:59.640 --> 31:04.640
You and I will talk when you're ready for 60s in a movie.

31:04.640 --> 31:05.640
Yeah.

31:05.640 --> 31:06.640
See that.

31:06.640 --> 31:07.640
Well, okay.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.000
So there's a thing I can't do.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
That's the thing.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.840
Post Veronica Mars world, like, like I feel sometimes I feel like not getting off the

31:14.840 --> 31:15.840
stage.

31:15.840 --> 31:21.000
Well, I feel, I do feel like people go there and go, how come Dan doesn't love community?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.040
How come he doesn't want to help us out?

31:23.040 --> 31:28.040
Because if he did, wouldn't he just jump on the internet and say, who wants to pay me

31:28.040 --> 31:30.520
a dollar, a ticket?

31:30.520 --> 31:34.200
I need $40 million to make the community movie and all the stuff.

31:34.200 --> 31:43.040
It's like, I, I, the, like the, can you tell me why I'm not doing that in a way that will

31:43.040 --> 31:48.200
make some people like feel less like I, it's like a symphony, not liking.

31:48.200 --> 31:51.480
I could guess a bunch of different reasons and I can tell you like why Joss Whedon doesn't

31:51.480 --> 31:55.160
do it with Firefly, which is the other one besides you that people keep asking for.

31:55.160 --> 31:58.400
And that's the, just because the possibility is there, doesn't mean that it's necessarily

31:58.400 --> 32:00.720
what you want to do with the next chunk of your life, or it doesn't mean that there's

32:00.720 --> 32:03.880
a story you want to tell just because people want a story told.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.720
Like if you had an idea and you had no other way to do it and you were itching to tell

32:06.720 --> 32:10.320
that story, then maybe you'd be looking at it, but to do it just because it's what people

32:10.320 --> 32:13.640
are clamoring for doesn't mean that you're going to get excited enough to make something

32:13.640 --> 32:14.640
right.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.880
So you're saying the reason there's not a community movie is because Dan doesn't like

32:16.880 --> 32:21.680
the community.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.600
That's pretty, that's, that's my worldview.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.360
I heard it's because I'm like Joss Whedon.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.360
That's what I heard.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.800
I feel like you, your simulation is glitching.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.000
Oh no.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.520
I didn't raise any money to remember your name.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.520
So that's okay.

32:38.520 --> 32:39.520
I haven't asked it.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.020
It's still Ivan.

32:41.020 --> 32:42.020
What is it?

32:42.020 --> 32:43.020
Ivan.

32:43.020 --> 32:44.020
Okay.

32:44.020 --> 32:53.480
Well, is there anything I want to honor you because you came up and stuck your neck out

32:53.480 --> 32:54.800
and like put up with this.

32:54.800 --> 33:00.520
So is there anything from your worldview that like you want to plug anything, tip anybody

33:00.520 --> 33:04.800
off to any, any like fucking projects you're cooking up?

33:04.800 --> 33:09.720
Is there a Knight Rider series that needs people to click on or any projects?

33:09.720 --> 33:14.600
Uh, I mean, I'm supposed to talk to Justin about something.

33:14.600 --> 33:15.600
Really?

33:15.600 --> 33:16.600
Oh shit.

33:16.600 --> 33:17.600
Maybe.

33:17.600 --> 33:21.720
About the fact that I'm always out of the loop on Justin projects.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.360
I'm, I'm, no comment.

33:24.360 --> 33:34.200
What are you supposed to talk about Justin about, what is he, what is he up to now?

33:34.200 --> 33:35.880
First you hold back on the Zach Braff.

33:35.880 --> 33:39.320
Now you're holding back on Justin.

33:39.320 --> 33:42.400
We want to know what is Rick and where are you being deprived of that it needs to be

33:42.400 --> 33:43.400
crowdfunded.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.880
It's so, it's a fucking virtual reality project.

33:45.880 --> 33:46.880
Isn't it?

33:46.880 --> 33:47.880
He's obsessed.

33:47.880 --> 33:51.760
I, I genuinely don't know what he wants to talk about.

33:51.760 --> 33:56.280
He might just want to introduce you to like a porn star or something.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.280
If there's money in it.

33:57.280 --> 33:58.280
Yeah.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.280
Yeah.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.280
You got to come over to my house.

34:00.280 --> 34:06.800
It's going to be great.

34:06.800 --> 34:09.040
Those pickups never end well.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.160
I never get invited anymore.

34:11.160 --> 34:13.480
Oh, it's all right.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.480
There'll still be a season four.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.160
We'll figure it out.

34:17.160 --> 34:18.160
All right.

34:18.160 --> 34:21.760
Well, so let's, let's, let's thank Ivan for, for sharing.

34:21.760 --> 34:27.320
I've been asked with, okay.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.320
Okay.

34:28.320 --> 34:33.680
And let's, let's, let's, let's, let's immediately now because I, I've eaten into their time.

34:33.680 --> 34:37.880
Let's, let's, let's bring up Robert Evans and Magenta Vaughn and we'll tell you.

34:37.880 --> 34:47.640
All right, sorry you guys, I don't know what, I guess I, I apologize too much.

34:47.640 --> 34:48.640
Yeah.

34:48.640 --> 34:51.360
For all you know, it's part of the format of the show for me to not bring up that one.

34:51.360 --> 34:52.360
Um, all right.

34:52.360 --> 34:55.760
So first let's just, I'd like you to explain your worldview.

34:55.760 --> 35:00.480
Uh, it's shit except for the stuff that's not, and that stuff's all right.

35:00.480 --> 35:03.360
That's what I think sometimes.

35:03.360 --> 35:08.600
We weren't talking about upstairs just to skip around because I'm a bad interviewer.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.800
You just came back from the Middle East.

35:09.800 --> 35:10.800
You were in Iraq specifically?

35:10.800 --> 35:11.800
Iraq and Turkey.

35:11.800 --> 35:12.800
Yeah.

35:12.800 --> 35:13.800
But mostly Iraq.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.240
Uh, so really right in the Middle East.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.240
Yeah.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.240
Right in the middle.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.880
We had to cross the, the Tigris to get where we were going.

35:20.880 --> 35:24.560
Um, the part, when the Middle East isn't prepared properly and it's the first place

35:24.560 --> 35:26.080
that's like cold.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.080
Um, okay.

35:28.080 --> 35:33.200
Um, but you were talking about like Rick and Morty fans.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.200
Yeah.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.200
In Iraq?

35:35.200 --> 35:36.200
Was it Iraq?

35:36.200 --> 35:37.200
Yeah.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.200
It was Iraq.

35:38.200 --> 35:39.200
Um, yeah.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.320
And we were talking about the fact that somebody, somebody quoted you, you take it so that someone's

35:41.320 --> 35:42.320
talking other than me.

35:42.320 --> 35:43.320
Yeah.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.760
So we, uh, we've got a couple of friends out there and one of them is this guy I R who's

35:45.760 --> 35:51.120
like 27 years old and his day job is taking journalists from Erbil, which is a safe city

35:51.120 --> 35:55.400
in Northern Iraq to Mosul, which is the city where all the ISIS guys are.

35:55.400 --> 35:59.080
So like one day he'll be in college studying for his business degree and the next day he'll

35:59.080 --> 36:02.560
be like taking sniper fire with the guys from vice or the guys from the New Yorker or the

36:02.560 --> 36:06.360
guys from the New York times or the Guardian, like he's worked with everybody that's done

36:06.360 --> 36:07.360
anything out there.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.360
Um, and so.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.360
Fake news.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.360
What's that?

36:10.360 --> 36:11.360
Fake news.

36:11.360 --> 36:12.360
Definitely.

36:12.360 --> 36:13.360
Sounds like fake news.

36:13.360 --> 36:14.360
Yeah.

36:14.360 --> 36:15.360
Okay.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.360
He's where the fake news comes from.

36:16.360 --> 36:17.360
All right.

36:17.360 --> 36:18.360
Gotcha.

36:18.360 --> 36:21.400
So this guy, like he's a, he's a perfectly normal dude.

36:21.400 --> 36:25.240
We'll talk about the Simpsons or whatever, just like Facebook, like he loves, like he,

36:25.240 --> 36:29.920
he, he, he shot a mannequin challenge video with members of the Iraqi army, like, well,

36:29.920 --> 36:31.880
they were, while they were under sniper fire.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.800
Like he went up to these guys and was like, I want, there's this thing called the mannequin

36:34.800 --> 36:37.120
challenge and I want to do it with you.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.480
And they were like, no, that's the dumbest idea in the world.

36:39.480 --> 36:42.080
But then he described it and they're like, oh, well, that's what we're supposed to do

36:42.080 --> 36:44.440
under sniper fire.

36:44.440 --> 36:45.440
It's decidedly not.

36:45.440 --> 36:46.440
Oh, okay.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.440
Cause they're like this.

36:47.440 --> 36:48.440
Yeah.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.440
They're, they're standing.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.440
It was dangerous.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.440
Oh God.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.440
That's awful.

36:52.440 --> 36:56.640
Could you imagine anything more horrible than a mannequin challenge video where midway

36:56.640 --> 36:57.640
through it?

36:57.640 --> 36:58.640
I mean, we've got it.

36:58.640 --> 36:59.960
We can show it later if you want.

36:59.960 --> 37:00.960
Okay.

37:00.960 --> 37:01.960
It ends horribly.

37:01.960 --> 37:02.960
No.

37:02.960 --> 37:03.960
That one doesn't end horribly.

37:03.960 --> 37:04.960
No.

37:04.960 --> 37:05.960
Please God.

37:05.960 --> 37:06.960
I don't want to see this.

37:06.960 --> 37:10.640
We're going to, we're going to delineate a visual chapter of the show for our audio

37:10.640 --> 37:15.960
only participants so that we can either edit it out or they can plug their eyes.

37:15.960 --> 37:20.600
But, but yeah, I just, I don't want to pepper the show with a, with a ton of visuals, but,

37:20.600 --> 37:26.120
but, uh, so all right, well, anyways, but just to finish that random thought, when we

37:26.120 --> 37:30.120
leave, I give this guy like my copies of Rick and Morty seasons one and two and he sends

37:30.120 --> 37:33.600
me like a Facebook message the day we get back and he's like, this is the show I've

37:33.600 --> 37:34.600
been waiting for all my life.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.640
This is the best thing I've ever watched.

37:36.640 --> 37:39.920
And he posts like a Rick meme to his Facebook, like Rick looking sad because he had like

37:39.920 --> 37:42.240
a tough day at school like the next day.

37:42.240 --> 37:45.520
And one of his friends who we'd met on the trip who also leads journalists up to the

37:45.520 --> 37:48.640
front line immediately posted, nobody belongs anywhere.

37:48.640 --> 37:51.800
Uh, you know, that whole quote, like everyone's going to die.

37:51.800 --> 37:52.800
Let's go watch TV.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.800
Right.

37:53.800 --> 37:57.480
Because if you, if you've grown up as a kid and Iraq your entire life, like you're

37:57.480 --> 38:01.120
tuned into the same global media cultures, everybody in this room, like we've all watched

38:01.120 --> 38:04.160
time cop and commando and whatever in community.

38:04.160 --> 38:07.600
But like also sometimes your friends explode because that's just like the nature of the

38:07.600 --> 38:08.600
world you live in.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.760
Like I are, we'd be talking with him about like bullshit.

38:10.760 --> 38:13.320
And then randomly he'd mention, Oh, sorry, my suspension's messed up.

38:13.320 --> 38:17.280
There was a car bomb and I got stuck in traffic and it blew up next to my car.

38:17.280 --> 38:22.280
So the suspension's all fucked like, so they're, they're perfectly set up for that kind of

38:22.280 --> 38:26.360
humor where it's like the, the, the darkness makes it feel right to them.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.360
Like they don't.

38:27.360 --> 38:28.360
I heard that.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.360
I thought that was it.

38:29.360 --> 38:35.320
Cause that reminded me of a thing my therapist was talking about, which was, uh, uh, she

38:35.320 --> 38:41.720
watched something, I think it was documentary about women in war, um, and not, not meaning

38:41.720 --> 38:47.200
women that put on a Kevlar vest and go out there like Vasquez and aliens, but, uh, uh,

38:47.200 --> 38:52.720
in traditional cultures where the men go away and then the boys go away and then, and meanwhile

38:52.720 --> 39:01.800
there's just, uh, rubble and, uh, need to continue as if life will continue after whatever's

39:01.800 --> 39:03.300
going on.

39:03.300 --> 39:11.560
And the psychological capacity of nurturers, uh, to be like, I don't fucking care about

39:11.560 --> 39:12.980
this war.

39:12.980 --> 39:18.640
This kid needs to learn the alphabet and he's not going to learn it or she, uh, if it's

39:18.640 --> 39:28.240
the wrong place to be inclusive, uh, they're not going to learn it, uh, uh, if I'm so passionate

39:28.240 --> 39:30.760
about the God damn struggle that's going on.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.600
It's like, it, it, there's something about that.

39:33.600 --> 39:37.240
I guess I related that to the idea that when you said that you said there's, if there's

39:37.240 --> 39:41.560
a kid somewhere where everything's blowing up and they're quoting that line from Rick

39:41.560 --> 39:48.400
and Morty, which believe me, when I write Rick and Morty and I like, I go to that nihilistic

39:48.400 --> 39:55.760
place, I do it with difficulty because I feel like first world kid, I feel like I'm part

39:55.760 --> 40:02.080
of the problem and not the solution sometimes, but it's like, because it's like kids, kids,

40:02.080 --> 40:05.320
kids already feel like life means nothing.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.920
Like that's called being a kid.

40:07.920 --> 40:14.320
And so if your favorite cartoon is also saying life means nothing, I mean, but the alternative

40:14.320 --> 40:16.480
is to say life means something and then I'd be lying.

40:16.480 --> 40:20.560
I can't, but it's, but, but it's just like, like, like, so that line where, where Morty

40:20.560 --> 40:26.000
says that, I remember, I remember typing that and going like, this is like the idea that

40:26.000 --> 40:30.920
you're selling consumerism, basically you're saying like, life means nothing comes down

40:30.920 --> 40:32.360
and watch TV.

40:32.360 --> 40:36.720
I was like, ah, this feels a little shitty, but at the same time it just feels, it's,

40:36.720 --> 40:40.320
it's like he's, he's being a good little brother is what she needs to hear, otherwise

40:40.320 --> 40:43.760
she's going to leave home.

40:43.760 --> 40:50.880
But hearing that somebody who is, whose life is being torn apart would cat, would, would

40:50.880 --> 40:52.760
latch onto that line.

40:52.760 --> 40:56.360
Then I go, oh, nihilism is like the baseline.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.760
The truth is life means nothing.

40:58.760 --> 41:02.720
If you, if you're wiping your ass with dollar bills and you say life means nothing, you're

41:02.720 --> 41:04.840
being a piece of shit.

41:04.840 --> 41:08.560
And if you're born in a bomb crater and you say life means nothing, you're actually like

41:08.560 --> 41:11.640
centering yourself and getting through shit.

41:11.640 --> 41:14.440
Like it's not, it's not nihilism if you live with that.

41:14.440 --> 41:18.160
Like if it's a real possibility that like someone you know could die any day just because

41:18.160 --> 41:21.720
like things explode where you live and that's a normal part of life or if you know you're

41:21.720 --> 41:24.120
going to get shot at when you get up in the morning.

41:24.120 --> 41:28.560
Like it's not nihilism to say, yeah, anyone can die at any point in time, let's enjoy

41:28.560 --> 41:33.040
ourselves for this 22 minutes that we have that we know we're not getting shot at probably

41:33.040 --> 41:34.040
right now.

41:34.040 --> 41:35.040
Like that's not nihilistic.

41:35.040 --> 41:39.400
That's like, that's like one of the most liberating things in the world is to be like, well I

41:39.400 --> 41:42.960
know that right now when I'm watching TV I'm probably pretty safe, I'm going to go out

41:42.960 --> 41:45.760
tomorrow and maybe die, but that's fucking in the morning.

41:45.760 --> 41:53.640
Yeah, I mean, I really am drunk and I, look, the thing is, what's that?

41:53.640 --> 41:57.200
Oh, you're such a, what does she have to say?

41:57.200 --> 42:05.520
We'll be right with you sir, in the meantime, enjoy your poppers.

42:05.520 --> 42:06.520
There's poppers?

42:06.520 --> 42:07.520
There's poppers tonight.

42:07.520 --> 42:08.520
Son of a bitch.

42:08.520 --> 42:12.960
There's a lot of things I do wrong, among them is also I don't introduce people, I don't

42:12.960 --> 42:19.120
tell them what's going on, it's like, I, no, it's okay.

42:19.120 --> 42:24.520
Your cookie's in the mail for caring about her.

42:24.520 --> 42:31.280
Magenta, what's your, so you guys, like let's get back to the top of the interview and what

42:31.280 --> 42:35.760
I should say, bypassing your worldview.

42:35.760 --> 42:40.240
You guys just came back from the Middle East, where are you the tippy typey, you tap the

42:40.240 --> 42:43.440
things and are you photographing things?

42:43.440 --> 42:48.480
And so what, how, are you guys young enough for me to ask how old you are?

42:48.480 --> 42:49.480
29.

42:49.480 --> 42:52.280
I'm a millennial.

42:52.280 --> 42:57.000
Everybody under 40 is now, yeah, because you hear me shitting on millennials all the

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
time.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.920
I just found out I'm one.

43:00.920 --> 43:02.320
Can I ask how old you are?

43:02.320 --> 43:03.320
27.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.320
27 and 29.

43:04.320 --> 43:05.320
Yeah.

43:05.320 --> 43:16.800
I, like, so you guys, in the interest of journalism, you go to this place that, like, if you guys

43:16.800 --> 43:26.360
were, knock on wood to have something horrible happen to you, like, the worst people in the

43:26.360 --> 43:30.560
world would be the ones to say, well, why'd they go over there?

43:30.560 --> 43:35.960
And the best people in the world would only say, oh, they went over there because they

43:35.960 --> 43:37.960
love their job.

43:37.960 --> 43:44.320
Like, nobody would say, well, good thing they went over there, like, so I want to know from

43:44.320 --> 43:51.000
you guys, like, because you, you're the verbal one, you're the, not the pigeonhole you guys,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.120
but you're taking pictures, you're writing stuff.

43:53.120 --> 43:54.440
We switch now.

43:54.440 --> 43:59.520
You're both journalists, you're providing, you're providing an otherwise ignorant world

43:59.520 --> 44:03.840
with an eye tore into a part that they otherwise wouldn't see.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.240
So why are you doing that?

44:06.240 --> 44:12.800
I mean, we went over there for the first time because I'd read about this place called Kurdistan,

44:12.800 --> 44:16.680
which is a region in northern Iraq that, if you read the news stories about it, it's supposed

44:16.680 --> 44:21.200
to be really nice, really stable, really safe, really advanced attitudes for the region towards

44:21.200 --> 44:22.200
women.

44:22.200 --> 44:26.400
Like, one of the rules is in their parliament, 30% of the seats have to be held by women,

44:26.400 --> 44:30.440
which is twice the representation of women in Congress in the United States, just as

44:30.440 --> 44:32.080
a heads up.

44:32.080 --> 44:35.200
It sounds like they're the Dan Harmon of Middle Eastern countries.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.840
That's, that's literally on their flag.

44:37.840 --> 44:39.760
It's a confusing flag.

44:39.760 --> 44:46.400
I also force myself to include a certain amount of women in everything I do.

44:46.400 --> 44:47.400
What per se.

44:47.400 --> 44:51.000
You're welcome.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.840
So it was one of those, like, we'd read all these reports, but they're also, like, you

44:55.840 --> 44:59.280
don't, you never know what's true about that, especially since, like, there's a lot of people

44:59.280 --> 45:02.720
on the, on the far right who have a lot of investment in Kurdistan, like the myth of

45:02.720 --> 45:05.960
that being real and it actually being a really nice place because it's the one era where,

45:05.960 --> 45:09.520
like, George Bush's plan worked out.

45:09.520 --> 45:10.520
So I didn't know what it was.

45:10.520 --> 45:12.320
What exactly is that real quick?

45:12.320 --> 45:16.560
Democracy in Iraq, a safe, nice place where people get to vote and things don't explode

45:16.560 --> 45:17.560
as much.

45:17.560 --> 45:19.760
And what are the, what are the industries that people are in?

45:19.760 --> 45:20.760
Oil.

45:20.760 --> 45:21.760
Okay.

45:21.760 --> 45:22.760
Almost entirely oil.

45:22.760 --> 45:25.640
It's super corrupt up there, the government, which might not be a great thing for when

45:25.640 --> 45:27.640
I go back to say, but, like, it's, it's,

45:27.640 --> 45:28.640
Oh, they listen.

45:28.640 --> 45:29.640
They listen to this show.

45:29.640 --> 45:30.640
Yeah.

45:30.640 --> 45:31.640
Kurdistan.

45:31.640 --> 45:32.640
It's a surprising number.

45:32.640 --> 45:33.640
All right.

45:33.640 --> 45:36.520
So I want to make sure I don't lose something, though, because there's a point.

45:36.520 --> 45:42.280
I want to go, I want to rewind your play deck to the point before you become the kind of

45:42.280 --> 45:45.760
person that wants to go to the Middle East as a journalist.

45:45.760 --> 45:50.680
And I want to, like, I want to frame forward from where you go from being someone that

45:50.680 --> 45:55.120
hadn't considered that at all to being somebody that was like, I'm going to go over there.

45:55.120 --> 46:00.600
Because it's probably one of the easiest decisions in the world for even the smartest, most liberal

46:00.600 --> 46:03.280
people to be like, yeah, but then also I don't go over there.

46:03.280 --> 46:05.080
Can I, can I butt in?

46:05.080 --> 46:08.760
It's kind of like, why would you eat meat?

46:08.760 --> 46:14.720
Like you should probably kill an animal and like know about what's going on in your side

46:14.720 --> 46:15.720
of your body.

46:15.720 --> 46:20.760
So like if millions of other people are living over there, why wouldn't you go there?

46:20.760 --> 46:23.760
Wait, wait, I want to make sure I know the parallel you're drawing.

46:23.760 --> 46:29.480
Because it's like, like, like why, I would eat meat because it's the easiest thing to

46:29.480 --> 46:30.480
do.

46:30.480 --> 46:31.480
No, it's not.

46:31.480 --> 46:32.480
Also, can you eat the mic just a bit?

46:32.480 --> 46:33.480
Sorry.

46:33.480 --> 46:34.480
Oh yeah, eat the mic.

46:34.480 --> 46:35.480
Definitely eat the mic.

46:35.480 --> 46:36.480
It's not me.

46:36.480 --> 46:40.000
I think you should be willing to do whatever, whatever you're partaking in.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.120
And if you're in the society, buying things as you are, living as you are, contributing

46:44.120 --> 46:48.040
to the whole world being the way it is, and you're fine with millions of other people

46:48.040 --> 46:51.160
dying and living through that, like why don't you go check it out, because they're doing

46:51.160 --> 46:52.160
it.

46:52.160 --> 46:53.160
Right.

46:53.160 --> 46:57.640
I, I, I, I know why it's a good thing to do.

46:57.640 --> 47:02.880
I don't, I, I'm talking to the human beings though, like, like, where do you get to the

47:02.880 --> 47:07.640
point where you find the ability to do it, because I know I shouldn't be eating meat.

47:07.640 --> 47:12.520
I think I'd be happier if I didn't eat meat, but then I, then Tuesday turns into Wednesday

47:12.520 --> 47:13.520
and Thursday.

47:13.520 --> 47:16.880
But like, I should kill an animal and try it and just like, see how it makes you feel

47:16.880 --> 47:17.880
about me.

47:17.880 --> 47:18.880
Right.

47:18.880 --> 47:19.880
I should, I should, I should.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.480
The question also is what makes you brave?

47:22.480 --> 47:23.480
Right.

47:23.480 --> 47:24.480
Exactly.

47:24.480 --> 47:25.480
That's what I'm trying to get at.

47:25.480 --> 47:28.280
We all feel like we have a responsibility, but your responsibility is great in that you

47:28.280 --> 47:31.360
put yourself in danger and come back and tell stories.

47:31.360 --> 47:33.480
What exactly made you do that?

47:33.480 --> 47:34.480
What makes you do that?

47:34.480 --> 47:35.480
Bravery.

47:35.480 --> 47:36.480
Yes.

47:36.480 --> 47:39.480
It's pretty fucking brave to go to some place where people are doing bombs and shit.

47:39.480 --> 47:43.200
You're just like in an airport and you're like buying your pretzel and drinking beer

47:43.200 --> 47:46.920
and you like walk onto the runway and you're like getting drunk in the airplane and then

47:46.920 --> 47:52.000
you're with other humans and there's dangerous things going around, but like, it's just,

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
you're moving physically to a different part of the world.

47:55.000 --> 48:00.120
Wait, Magenta, sorry, just put, put, always, I want to make sure people hear you.

48:00.120 --> 48:01.120
Okay.

48:01.120 --> 48:02.120
Sorry.

48:02.120 --> 48:09.200
But that's, this is the thing, it's like, can you remember a version of you that didn't

48:09.200 --> 48:14.400
have that altruism that wasn't functioning on that level?

48:14.400 --> 48:19.240
Can you remember a version of you that was selfish and lazy and did what was easy?

48:19.240 --> 48:20.840
That's the only version of me.

48:20.840 --> 48:21.840
What changed?

48:21.840 --> 48:23.280
Did you see something?

48:23.280 --> 48:24.280
Did you feel something?

48:24.280 --> 48:26.440
Did you have a dialogue with yourself?

48:26.440 --> 48:28.640
No pressure.

48:28.640 --> 48:36.360
But I think the reason is because like, if I could just, I'll just babble and derail.

48:36.360 --> 48:37.360
This is the thing.

48:37.360 --> 48:40.960
Like, it is like, there's all these people in the world and then you go like, oh, there's

48:40.960 --> 48:43.360
one of those, there's one of those war journalists.

48:43.360 --> 48:47.520
Oh, they got the vest, they got the camera.

48:47.520 --> 48:52.840
I just came back from Kublaka, Blaka, oh, what happened there?

48:52.840 --> 48:56.520
Oh, well, there was this guy and then the wheel came off and then there's like, but

48:56.520 --> 48:59.680
then we didn't know, we had to get blindfolded, all this stuff.

48:59.680 --> 49:02.400
And the rest of us are thinking deep down inside, we're going like, well, I'll take

49:02.400 --> 49:06.040
that information and I'll put it on my coffee mug and I'll use it to bully someone at work

49:06.040 --> 49:09.880
tomorrow because I want them to vote for someone instead of someone.

49:09.880 --> 49:17.320
But deep, deep, deep, deep down, although none of us are soldiers, you guys, you guys

49:17.320 --> 49:25.120
go there figuratively and literally, it's truly a risk and it's truly more importantly

49:25.120 --> 49:29.680
a risk that no one would even, that's what I was saying before.

49:29.680 --> 49:36.720
And so I'm just, okay, one more, let me just, the valuable thing about me nitpicking this

49:36.720 --> 49:45.160
is precisely because if you guys aren't that different from us, if you weren't born special

49:45.160 --> 49:51.400
and brave, there might be something, there might be something we could, we could think

49:51.400 --> 49:55.200
with or maybe some path we could walk down where we end up like acting instead of thinking.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.320
So that's why I'm asking.

49:57.320 --> 50:02.880
I mean, I can say the first war zone we ever reported from was in Eastern Ukraine, it was

50:02.880 --> 50:04.040
this town called Avdivka.

50:04.040 --> 50:06.000
Okay, but before that, no, I'm kidding.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.720
We have what I'm getting to, Dan.

50:08.720 --> 50:15.400
We want to know, did you get into a fight and it may, what made you, what made you suddenly

50:15.400 --> 50:18.920
say, I'm going to do a little bit more than the average person when it comes to getting

50:18.920 --> 50:19.920
facts.

50:19.920 --> 50:23.440
I didn't like cleaning up dead animals and cockroaches and mobile homes.

50:23.440 --> 50:24.760
There we go.

50:24.760 --> 50:31.520
When you did it though, did you do it like as a journalist or you're like, I'm standing

50:31.520 --> 50:36.280
over three dead bodies, roaches, the carnage here right now.

50:36.280 --> 50:38.640
You can say, Robert, I didn't mean to.

50:38.640 --> 50:41.640
I mean, I, like, I get, there's two parts to that question.

50:41.640 --> 50:46.680
One of them is that like it's fun, like up until someone gets horrifically injured, it's

50:46.680 --> 50:50.600
a lot of fun out there, like you're moving around, everything's going fast, you're writing

50:50.600 --> 50:54.240
around in cool vehicles, everyone's really friendly, everything's super funny.

50:54.240 --> 50:59.720
Like anything that happens in a war zone, like it's hilarious to everybody who's there.

50:59.720 --> 51:03.480
Like it's just like, at one point we're at this area where like some ISIS snipers had

51:03.480 --> 51:06.680
just been shooting and they've been shooting rockets back at them and this guy is like

51:06.680 --> 51:10.240
trying to load a big rocket and he leans over and all the grenades fall off of his vest

51:10.240 --> 51:14.920
and down the berm and he's like, it's like, it was like a fucking like slapstick comedy

51:14.920 --> 51:19.400
moment as he's like going for all these grenades and he sees we're filming him and he's like,

51:19.400 --> 51:22.400
you could tell the guy felt so bad that we caught that moment where he looked like a

51:22.400 --> 51:24.920
badass and then he drops his grenades on camera.

51:24.920 --> 51:28.760
This brings up an interesting, my mind is scrambling because I have two big questions

51:28.760 --> 51:35.840
off of that to ask which is, but I think the one I don't want to forget is when, so you're

51:35.840 --> 51:39.920
traveling with military people always.

51:39.920 --> 51:41.560
No, no, no.

51:41.560 --> 51:42.720
They're up at the front.

51:42.720 --> 51:47.080
You usually, so all of the war journalism, whether it's vice or the New York Times or

51:47.080 --> 51:50.920
the New Yorker or the Guardian or the BBC, anytime you see this report from Iraq, this

51:50.920 --> 51:56.880
report from Syria, those guys got in a car with some local person whose primary qualification

51:56.880 --> 52:01.720
was speaks good English and knows someone involved in the military in some way there

52:01.720 --> 52:03.480
and that person led them around.

52:03.480 --> 52:08.360
They're called fixers and it's like a little cottage economy that pops up all around.

52:08.360 --> 52:11.840
I should probably plug, we're raising money for a documentary about some of these guys

52:11.840 --> 52:12.840
called the fixers.

52:12.840 --> 52:19.120
It's on Indiegogo, sorry about that.

52:19.120 --> 52:24.040
But they, and these guys, they range from like literal war profiteers to where they're

52:24.040 --> 52:28.760
just like, you're just paying them $600 to drive you to a dangerous place to like actual

52:28.760 --> 52:29.760
good journalists.

52:29.760 --> 52:33.040
Like there's this great New Yorker article that the two people we worked with for this

52:33.040 --> 52:36.440
documentary helped put together where like, this guy from the New Yorker was like, I

52:36.440 --> 52:39.840
want to talk to some, I know this battle is going to start for Mosul, I want to talk to

52:39.840 --> 52:43.720
these Iraqi special forces and they were like, well actually there's the SWAT team of guys

52:43.720 --> 52:47.580
that were put together because they all had someone they know killed by ISIS and so it's

52:47.580 --> 52:50.320
like this huge vengeance quest for all of these guys.

52:50.320 --> 52:53.160
These are the dudes you should get embedded with and he did and it's a great article

52:53.160 --> 52:55.000
on the New Yorker by Luke Mubleson.

52:55.000 --> 53:00.840
He's there, so like, and it's not political the reason I'm asking the question, it's like,

53:00.840 --> 53:12.240
it's because you guys are, I, if I had a fire person up here, is that, a fire lady?

53:12.240 --> 53:19.640
If I had a firefighter up here, which I never have, I'd be like, okay, why would you ever

53:19.640 --> 53:20.920
run into a fire?

53:20.920 --> 53:24.880
And I know I get some answer, like, I feel comfortable because I've watched enough Scorsese

53:24.880 --> 53:29.600
movies and stuff that I, you know, if they were like, well, my dad was a Southie and

53:29.600 --> 53:34.760
I said, you know, you got to fight fire, you know, and I'm like, and I'm not, I'm not,

53:34.760 --> 53:39.600
I'm not saying, I'm not trivializing it or undercutting it, I'm saying like, I can map

53:39.600 --> 53:48.600
that in my universe the same way that in pre-Columbian Earth we could go, here there's dragons.

53:48.600 --> 53:57.040
I've always been fascinated with this archetype where you guys, like, you're, you're going

53:57.040 --> 54:00.840
and pointing and clicking and you're, and you're writing about and you're interviewing in these

54:00.840 --> 54:06.760
places that all we know about them and all we seem to continue to know about them is

54:06.760 --> 54:10.400
that they're a mess and that, and that they're be dragons.

54:10.400 --> 54:17.080
And so I, I, I, I kind of like, I don't want you to compromise your integrity if, if you

54:17.080 --> 54:22.640
feel like it makes you sound like a douchebag, but if you were to say to me, you know what,

54:22.640 --> 54:28.800
at the end of the day, it's just the perfect slot, like, I feel like it's just enough trouble

54:28.800 --> 54:33.200
and just low enough risk or if you put it on, I'd be like, okay, I got it, I got it.

54:33.200 --> 54:34.200
It's not that.

54:34.200 --> 54:38.320
I think, okay, so this is where I think you're, and I think we're like 99% of people who

54:38.320 --> 54:40.120
haven't been to a place like that.

54:40.120 --> 54:42.840
And I think probably most people who go there as part of the military because you only see

54:42.840 --> 54:45.400
a very limited chunk of these countries when you're doing that.

54:45.400 --> 54:48.120
You see it through the eyes of, of some of these geopolitical strengths.

54:48.120 --> 54:49.120
Exactly.

54:49.120 --> 54:54.360
And you're in, like, even in a place like Iraq, most of the country is perfectly nice.

54:54.360 --> 54:56.880
Like geographically, most of the country is nice.

54:56.880 --> 55:01.440
Iraqis are the kindest people to guests that you will ever meet in the world.

55:01.440 --> 55:03.760
They will, there were times when we would be, we would be in Mosul.

55:03.760 --> 55:07.640
So we're in the most dangerous city on earth probably, like there's all night you're hearing

55:07.640 --> 55:12.160
the sounds of gunfire, there's fucking like vehicle based IEDs blowing up and like sending

55:12.160 --> 55:16.720
mushroom clouds up into the, up into the sky a mile away and you, you drive up to where

55:16.720 --> 55:20.520
like just some dudes are bunked down and their job is to pull people out of like collapsed

55:20.520 --> 55:21.520
buildings.

55:21.520 --> 55:25.440
They got blown up in airstrikes every day and you're like, can we crash here tonight?

55:25.440 --> 55:26.800
And of course you're staying here tonight.

55:26.800 --> 55:27.800
We're going to cook you dinner.

55:27.800 --> 55:30.760
Like we've got all this tea on, like we're getting our tobacco up.

55:30.760 --> 55:32.040
Let's talk and hang out all night.

55:32.040 --> 55:34.360
Like you guys will be as safe here as you are anywhere.

55:34.360 --> 55:38.360
Like if you spend more than like 20 minutes talking to anyone in their house in Iraq,

55:38.360 --> 55:39.760
they're going to invite you to stay the night.

55:39.760 --> 55:41.360
They're going to invite you to cook food for you.

55:41.360 --> 55:43.280
They're going to put out tea for you.

55:43.280 --> 55:47.000
Like you have to, you have to turn people down from giving you hospitality.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.320
Like we would be talking to people who'd had family members killed in American airstrikes

55:51.320 --> 55:54.000
and had a lot of reasons to be angry at the U.S. and they would tell it to you.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.120
They'd be like, you know, I have issues with your government, but I don't know that's just

55:57.120 --> 55:58.120
your politicians.

55:58.120 --> 56:00.880
You're a guest here in my home and I'm going to take the best care of you that you've ever

56:00.880 --> 56:01.880
had taken of you.

56:01.880 --> 56:06.080
Like it's, you don't feel like when people are shooting at you during those limited

56:06.080 --> 56:09.320
chunks of time and they, they generally are pretty limited temporally.

56:09.320 --> 56:13.520
They're, they're, they're in enough supply for me to the extent that it would ever happen.

56:13.520 --> 56:14.520
Yeah.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.520
A little bit go a long way.

56:15.520 --> 56:19.920
But that, that part, that part's like there's, there's fear in that part, but the rest of

56:19.920 --> 56:21.760
the time you're not actively terrified.

56:21.760 --> 56:22.760
I'm sorry.

56:22.760 --> 56:26.440
When we mentioned homelessness one night after we were, thought we were finished filming

56:26.440 --> 56:30.640
the documentary, I are the guy that we're, one of the guys we're doing it on.

56:30.640 --> 56:34.960
He didn't understand the concept of homelessness and that just blew my mind.

56:34.960 --> 56:35.960
Yeah.

56:35.960 --> 56:39.200
We're talking with all these guys whose job again is to pull people out of like burning

56:39.200 --> 56:41.080
buildings and whatnot.

56:41.080 --> 56:43.760
And like none of these guys have been paid in two and a half years because they're all

56:43.760 --> 56:46.760
civil employees of the city that got taken over by ISIS.

56:46.760 --> 56:49.400
So they spent two and a half years living under ISIS control.

56:49.400 --> 56:52.960
The city got liberated and now they're doing the same job for the Iraqi government, but

56:52.960 --> 56:56.400
they're still not getting paid because the government hasn't reactivated their paychecks.

56:56.400 --> 56:59.000
And we get onto the subject of homelessness in Los Angeles.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.240
And he's like, wait, go back home.

57:00.240 --> 57:01.240
What do you mean homeless people?

57:01.240 --> 57:03.240
Like, like they have less home?

57:03.240 --> 57:04.240
Yeah.

57:04.240 --> 57:05.240
We had to explain it.

57:05.240 --> 57:06.240
Right.

57:06.240 --> 57:07.240
Where are their families?

57:07.240 --> 57:11.840
I would say that that is blowing my mind and also makes sense because you're like, wait,

57:11.840 --> 57:20.520
where else but a totally entrenched capitalistic first world empire would you go, oh, no home.

57:20.520 --> 57:25.320
What did he do wrong?

57:25.320 --> 57:32.760
But is that, God, I don't mean to keep nagging you about this, but is that, why is that?

57:32.760 --> 57:36.880
Let me pitch you something, say yes or no.

57:36.880 --> 57:45.840
You do it because you get the satisfaction of knowing that you've taken the more Keanu

57:45.840 --> 57:49.880
pill from the Matrix than the Pantiliano's pill.

57:49.880 --> 57:54.760
I can't remember which color is which, but I know one hates women and one hates Pantiliano's.

57:54.760 --> 57:59.120
See, well, that's the thing, like you're out there and there's sand in your head and you're

57:59.120 --> 58:03.080
like, I'm like, what about the Matrix?

58:03.080 --> 58:04.080
Is that part of it?

58:04.080 --> 58:06.840
Is it like kind of like, man, I live in fucking Riyadh.

58:06.840 --> 58:07.840
Personality, man.

58:07.840 --> 58:14.320
Like you're like a weird drone, you know, normal person and like, are you like a weird drone?

58:14.320 --> 58:15.320
Yes.

58:15.320 --> 58:19.000
No, me, I'm saying, I'm saying, is that part of the satisfaction of being like, yeah,

58:19.000 --> 58:22.040
I want to breathe free air, i.e. real air.

58:22.040 --> 58:27.240
I don't want to, I don't want to be like the actor, Joe Pantiliano, who you should really

58:27.240 --> 58:33.200
Google and appreciate in the Matrix, he's the Judas character who is like, give me the

58:33.200 --> 58:38.720
stake, give me the, you know, not a new myth, but it was modernized, so I use that to connect

58:38.720 --> 58:39.720
with the kids.

58:39.720 --> 58:42.680
Also, we kind of think that we're good at adventure.

58:42.680 --> 58:44.760
And so maybe we have a little bit of ego there.

58:44.760 --> 58:48.800
Like we think that we can get a little bit deeper than the journalist next to us.

58:48.800 --> 58:49.800
And so that's kind of a fun challenge.

58:49.800 --> 58:51.640
There's a competitive aspect to it.

58:51.640 --> 58:56.600
I want to ask that really difficult question that I don't think I would ever have the balls

58:56.600 --> 59:01.200
to ask a soldier because I feel like I would be, I would actually almost be somehow spiritually

59:01.200 --> 59:02.200
offensive.

59:02.200 --> 59:14.680
But do you guys feel like you're, like, karmically, like, no, not at all, like you get, like you

59:14.680 --> 59:20.720
got a little bubble around you, like you're a hobbit and not an elf, like, no, we bought

59:20.720 --> 59:21.720
medical kits.

59:21.720 --> 59:27.720
I'll just kind of, you know, I'm more important, not more important, but more like detached,

59:27.720 --> 59:33.480
like, like, like when R2 and C3 people are walking through the spaceship in the beginning

59:33.480 --> 59:36.440
of the original Star Wars, you should look at that up too.

59:36.440 --> 59:42.400
I've seen the original Star Wars, I don't know what to believe anymore, but it's like,

59:42.400 --> 59:47.000
no one shoots a droid, why would you, you know, the answer is because one of them holds

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
the fucking hope.

59:48.000 --> 59:53.760
Is that, is that, like, part of the journalist, like, like, like, fetish maybe?

59:53.760 --> 59:54.760
No.

59:54.760 --> 01:00:01.520
I don't, like, for me, it's, like, I've always liked to travel and stuff, and I like that

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.520
feeling of, like, getting an idea of how, like, tiny you are.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.600
And it's also, like, extreme experiences are interesting, and there's nothing more extreme

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.600
than that experience.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.200
There's nothing more extreme than, like, being in it.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.000
Like, it looks like, like, Mosul right now looks like you see these movies, like, World

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.640
War II movies of Stalingrad and stuff, like, what was the, the, the one about the sniper

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.640
in there?

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:22.640
I don't know.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.640
Enemy at the gates.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.960
Like, it looks, like, it looks like that, so you're seeing all this stuff that, like,

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.000
you never would have imagined seeing with your own eyes, and it's so shocking and weird

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
and fascinating.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.440
And as, like, a journalist, like, my whole, the whole thing that motivates me is talking

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.880
to people with more interesting stories than me.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.840
And so that kind of place, like, you, any single person you just walk up to and start

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.440
talking to, they have experiences you can't imagine, they've seen things that I can't

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.160
even comprehend, they have, they have a thousand experiences to tell me.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.840
So, like, normally working, like, when I'm at the Republican National Convention or the

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.920
Democratic Convention, like, doing, like, you walk up to people and most people don't

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.760
have anything interesting, interesting to say, and the people that do have, like, two

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.760
interesting sentences.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.800
Like, you go to a place like that, everybody you talk to has a thousand fascinating things

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.800
to say.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:09.320
And I would imagine, I don't want to take, but it's, it's the same way with pictures

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.040
there, too, like, anywhere you turn.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.760
That was the, I was absolutely going to go there.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.400
Oh, here's a, yeah, here's a concrete example.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.480
You're holding up a can, you guys showed me these cans.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.840
This is just in the department of, if you go far enough in the world, there's shit you

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.440
won't believe, which is, they sell cans of liquor.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.680
This is canned whiskey.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.680
It's not, it's not a mixed drink.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.520
Like it's not, it's not a whiskey soda.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.720
It's not like a little bit of whiskey poured into it.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.080
This is straight whiskey.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:43.480
And there's, it's around for sips, if people want sips, it's not going to push it.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:47.080
There is a can, there is a can back at the bar that should be open now, if people want

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.680
to take little bits of it, and we can pass this around.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.680
It's God awful.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.040
Um, I'm not, there's, there's no sugarcoating this.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.040
It's the worst thing to drink.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.080
We have a hand raised, I'll reward your politeness by giving you the floor.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.080
I'll fall on that grenade.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.560
Oh, wait, what?

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.400
Oh, oh, you just went liquor.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.400
Jesus.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.720
And you used the worst metaphor ever.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.920
Not that they're soldiers, but like, I mean, that is like,

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.680
You know, Willie Roberts, he found a grenade in Los Feliz.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.680
What?

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.280
He just found a grenade somewhere.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.160
The police came and blew it up.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.160
Oh, nice.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.160
All right.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.160
Next episode.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.160
Yeah.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.160
You would, you would have loved it.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:31.600
I wanted to, we, we, because Magenta, you're, uh, you look for, through a camera while

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.600
you're there.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.600
I'm not pigeonholing you because you said backstage like, well, you'll like to do the,

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:44.000
you want to do the typing too, but, um, or the talking, you guys overlap or the talking

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:53.680
but the, okay, but the I, when you're abroad and you're covering war, uh, what, I, I, I,

01:02:53.680 --> 01:03:01.840
like you, you be the judge of whether or not it's like, uh, should we, do you want to talk

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:08.440
about it or do you want to show some of the stuff, uh, that you guys brought while you

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440
talk about it?

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.840
Is that like a better way to do it?

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.200
You can do that at some point, any, any point you want.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:18.000
Cause I think, yeah, it'd probably be an easy thing in the, for the audio podcast listeners.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.080
If we're, let's just look at some stuff and let's just make an edit point here and say,

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.960
hey, $5 a month.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:31.960
Oh, for the, for the podcast, we should just put in like screaming, just like screeching

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.320
and just the solid me undies ad.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.320
Yeah.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.320
Here's a, here's a free me undies ad I want to give.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.440
I shit my pants this morning.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.920
Where were you?

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:50.200
Because of a weekend of drinking nothing but Soylent because my girlfriend is writing.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:59.040
So she's not around to order pizza with, uh, I, I was so unwilling to throw my me undies

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.640
away.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:10.760
I watched them in the sink, which sink that was not an ad for Soylent.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.680
Me undies didn't pay for it.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.400
I just love me undies that much and don't want to throw them away.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400
All right.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.400
Well, that's convinced me.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.400
How do I get these underpants?

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:24.880
I'll get, uh, you, you, yeah, go to, not those underpants, right?

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.760
I'm telling you, they're, it's like, it's, it's, it's incredible.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.680
You can put them on Kickstarter.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.440
I mean, but that's why, and then I go like, well, so why would I go to Iraq?

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.800
They don't have me undies.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.840
I mean, they, they might have them there.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.560
Well, if we, if we, if we bring freedom to them, of course, you know, what, what I did

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:46.160
get over there was a pair, a great pair of Hugo bass underwear.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.960
But did they have micro modale, a fabric that's three times softer than cotton?

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960
Nice.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.960
Nice.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.400
I, is that a, is that a synthetic fiber?

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.400
Oh yeah.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.160
It's made in LA, I think.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.640
You don't want to wear synthetic fibers and cause when things light on fire around you,

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.800
they can melt to your skin.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.160
If you get hit by an incendiary, you want to have natural fiber.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.680
What's the verdict on the whiskey so far?

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:12.680
It's good.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.680
All right.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.600
I can't, I can't believe y'all are saying that.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.080
Do you want the actual, this is the actual whiskey.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.080
This one's different.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.080
It's not a sweet.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.080
Oh man.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.080
Oh man.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.080
Part of a faux pas.

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.080
All right.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.080
No, do it.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.080
No, go ahead.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.440
And let's put a, we'll put a little edit marker somewhere around here.

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.440
If you're...

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.440
It's a mannequin challenge.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.440
It's pretty funny.

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.000
We're going to, we're going to look at some stuff that only you guys are looking at because

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
you're here.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.640
We'll describe it to you though.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.280
There's a feminist American militia one.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.280
Start with the mannequin challenge.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.280
That was pretty funny.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.280
Yeah.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.280
So this is, so I went to these guys and was like, I want to do this, there's this thing

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.600
called the mannequin challenge, guys who are in an active war zone.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.360
I want you to do this for me.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.360
And they were like, no.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.360
I love it.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:59.800
So you had the balls to say to them, hey, could you plank for me and...

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.800
Yeah.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:05.000
Yeah, does this sort of thing happen a lot as like people dabbing when grenades are going

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
through the air?

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
No.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.960
Ice bucket challenge.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.480
So he tells him to do this and they say, no, but part of his job, like the reason he's

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:17.400
a good fixer, the reason he can get journalists places is that he just, he meets a lot of

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:21.000
officers and like captains, colonels, generals, and you get their phone numbers.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.360
Like it's the Iraqi military is not like the US military.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.600
Like it's all about who you know, you bring people cigarettes and they're your buddy.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:31.000
So he calls their captain up and he says, I want you to make them do this.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.680
And their captain called them and said, do this.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.680
And then they had to do it.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.960
And you can tell how pissed they are in the video.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:43.440
Is it going to fuck things up because I don't think Joel's going to be able to contain himself.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.440
You're what?

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.600
He's going to start making funny riffs during the...

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:47.600
I think that's fine.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.400
No, we all, you all know how this, you all know how the mannequin challenge goes.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:07:01.400
All right, well, since I was but you said, of course, see, just like real men, that girl

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:09.400
is a real crowd, please, small world, all the friends know me, young boy living like an

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:17.400
old kid, release the cash, watch it fall slowly, right girl, still trying to get it, haters

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.400
mad for whatever reason.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:26.400
They're smoking the air, they're drinking, they lose it when the DJ drops and he ain't

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.400
gonna lose.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:33.400
Getting so gone, I'm not thinking, what in the world was I thinking today?

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.400
No money to be made.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.400
Damn.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:41.400
Rappers ain't shit.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.400
Rappers are not shit.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:49.400
If you have guns in your video and you're trying to act hard and shit, you're not this fucking

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.400
hard.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.400
This is as hard as a fucking hit.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.400
I think you won the mannequin challenge.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:02.400
It's weird to think about because when we think of soldiers, we think of army men, we think

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.400
of World War II, we think of guys in camouflage holding guns because they're detached from

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.400
what's going on at home.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.400
And what's going on at home is television and Bart Simpson and donuts and that's what

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.400
they're fighting for and all this stuff.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:21.400
So to be in a third world country and be holding an assault rifle and your orders are to kill

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:26.400
another human being with fast flying pieces of metal that are gonna be projected from

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:32.400
your gun, but to have a phone in your pocket connected to Donald Trump's tweets and stranger

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.400
things, gossip.

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.400
I don't know if like, and to have a journalist telling you, hey, do you know what the mannequin

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.400
challenge is?

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.400
Oh yeah, I know what that is.

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.400
I'll do that.

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.400
I'm gonna go back to blowing the head off of someone if they do the wrong thing like

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.400
appear in front of me.

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.400
I want to clarify that was filmed by IR who's our fixer.

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:52.400
We had nothing to do with that.

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.400
That was his purely he was motivated to do that when he was up there.

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.400
Wait, so you weren't there?

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.400
I was not there at that point.

01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.400
No, that was in October.

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.400
So he's like, hey, should I do the mannequin challenge?

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.400
And you're like, you don't have to do that for me.

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.400
And he's like, no, it'll be great.

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.400
Oh, he did that for him.

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.400
That was all for IR.

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:09.400
How do you get, how do you get people to trust you?

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:12.400
How do you get people to take you where you need to go to see things?

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.400
I mean, it's, it's most about meeting good people.

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.400
So before we went over there, I got the numbers and names of a bunch of different fixers who

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.400
are all people who said they could do this for us.

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:24.400
And then I found people who they were connected to on Twitter who had like the guy that I

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.400
wound up reaching out to runs a company that helps recover people who have been kidnapped

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.400
and ransomed.

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:34.400
So this guy was a friend of the guy that I was going to work with when it was like a

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.400
Twitter buddy of the guy was going to work with.

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.400
And I was like, hey, did you work with this guy in Iraq?

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.400
And he said, yes.

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.400
So this guy has like clear credentials.

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.400
He knows what he's doing.

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.400
He's got a record.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.400
I say, can I trust this guy?

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.400
And he says, yes, I would say you can trust him with your life.

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.400
Do people like, do they know you're liberal?

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.400
Do they care that their story is going to get told a certain way?

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:56.400
I have, I, we, the first time we met, oh, sorry.

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.400
I think they're hyper aware around journalists.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.400
Okay.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.400
They don't want.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.400
Bullshit.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.400
So you have to really sift through it.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.400
And how do you do that?

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.400
How do you get to like, we want to know what's really going on?

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:09.400
Do you want to talk about the Japanese guy that was there for a week?

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.400
Yeah.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.400
So this sets up some of the other footage.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.400
So like, this kind of dovetails in the topic of fake news.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.400
So we're there.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:21.400
We're there one morning and we drive into West Mosul, which is the part of the city

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.400
that's still a big chunk of it's held by ISIS.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:27.400
And we get up to the front and our fixers are with us like, there's going to be a

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.400
caravan with a bunch of other journalists and a bunch of Iraqi army guys.

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.400
We need to ride with them up to the front, but we want to escape from them as soon as

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.400
we can so we can run around without handlers and whatnot so we can actually get a good

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.400
story.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.400
Seems like a good idea.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.400
Yeah.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.400
You don't want to be where all the other people with cameras are, but we wound up getting

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.400
corralled into this van and wind up with these guys anyway.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.400
And they take us to a section of the front line and where there are five minutes and

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.400
there's one or two sniper shots from ISIS and they just start firing.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.400
The Iraqi army just starts firing all of the RPGs and these big weapons called

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.400
SPG-9s and just shooting everything off.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.400
You called my name.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.400
You were talking to me and I was walking through this part that you're supposed to run

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.400
through, but he said my name so I turned around and I forgot that I'm not supposed to

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.400
like, that's not a good place to stand.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.400
So I was there for too long so someone started shooting.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.400
But there was a berm above us.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.400
Nobody could hit us, which was the point.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.400
So this is the point is that we were never in, it was not a real firefight.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.400
We watched this thing happen and it's incredibly, it looks like a movie, it feels like an

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.400
actual fight, and then after it gets done and all these, there's like 20 people filming

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.400
it, our fixers turn to us and they're like, you know that was mostly bullshit, right?

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.400
Like every morning they lead journalists right here and there's always that, that always happens.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.400
It's like 1,000 outgoing shots for everyone I'm coming.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:43.400
But you guys know, that takes me back to this all important point.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:54.400
It's like you guys do perceive the, like you, do you make peace with the idea like I do

01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:02.400
when I fly on an airplane, period, because it's, that's too much for me to be out of

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:08.400
that much control and to have these savages called flight attendants like in charge of

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.400
my destiny.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:19.400
Like I need to decide before I get on the plane, I might die, blah, blah, blah.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.400
I hope not to.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.400
You could argue I expect not to.

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.400
I will complain if I start dying.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.400
I will go to my grave dying.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.400
If I did what you do, I can't do that.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.400
I can't be like, oh, look at that landmine go off.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.400
Wait, there's one under me.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.400
I've had it.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:45.400
But if I get on a United Airlines and a cop starts tasing me because their Christmas discount

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:50.400
isn't working or whatever the fuck, I can be like, this is bullshit.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.400
It might not work, but at least I have that recourse.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.400
That is a blanket we wrap around ourselves.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.400
We feel like complaining.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:03.400
We're never more than one complain away from our mommy grabbing us and going, it's okay.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.400
And that's why I continue to eat meat.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:12.400
Because to continue to do what you did before and to only cry out and to only do things

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.400
when something's wrong, that's just primatology.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:23.400
And that's why I keep harping on that because I truly do wish because I want to know.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.400
The biggest thing in my mind is I want to know, when you guys look at people like me,

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.400
do you go, you fucking gross piece of shit?

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.400
Or are you like, that's the customer.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.400
Well, let's go up.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.400
Take some more pictures of landmines for them.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:43.400
Okay, so here's what you're getting at there is what makes something really scary is not having any control.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:48.400
They did a series of studies on fighter pilots in Vietnam back during that whole war thing

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:53.400
and they found out that, so most of these fighters would have, there's the actual pilot and then there's the navigator.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:58.400
And so in the weeks leading up to the mission, the navigator who was planning the mission,

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.400
who was deciding where they were going to go and exactly what was going to happen, had very low stress levels.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.400
And the fighter pilot's stress levels spiked because they had no control over anything.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:11.400
And then during the actual mission, when they're actually flying, the fighter pilots have zero stress,

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.400
but the navigator's stress spikes because you have no control over that plane.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.400
That's what makes things scary is the lack of control.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.400
So when you're in a plane at 30, 40,000 feet, however the fuck high planes go,

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.400
I don't have any more ability to affect that than you do.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:29.400
But like when I'm in Mosul and somebody might shoot at me,

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:36.400
I have the ability to run and hide behind a heavy wall or find the biggest Iraqi guy in a body armor and hide behind the wall.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.400
That's the whole problem though. That's the thing, like when I go in the Batman ride at Six Flags.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:46.400
Completely perfect parallel.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:50.400
It's the only parallel I have.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:56.400
When they lower a big fucking 90s or more modern like great over you,

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.400
like eating meat by the way, it's like I'm telling you,

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:04.400
when you have society's fucking permission to be like a piece of garbage,

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.400
when you're like clank, you're like it's not my fault if anyone gets decapitated on this ride.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.400
I can't, I'm in a Batman harness.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.400
I can't do shit. Scariest roller coaster I ever went on.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.400
The world's oldest roller coaster is like Six Flags.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:27.400
The eagle, they put you in a wagon and put a jump rope across your lap.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:32.400
I am now at fault if everyone dies, including myself.

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.400
I'm going to fail.

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.400
That to me is, you're saying, you sound like you'd be like,

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:42.400
whoof, hate being in that Batman harness, not enough control.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.400
I'm like, what are you talking about?

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.400
Give me a sedative.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.400
Would you rather kill yourself or someone else kill you?

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.400
Would I rather kill myself or have someone else kill me?

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.400
Okay, I love you.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:16:00.400
By the way, I also love our audience who tweeted,

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.400
I said we have war journalists fresh back from Middle East

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:09.400
and there's a fucking handful of shit that would make Chomsky fumfer.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.400
I want to get to them, but I also want to see photos.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.400
I want to ask, okay, would I rather kill myself or be killed?

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.400
I'd rather kill myself.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:29.400
But here's the thing.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.400
I think this is really important.

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:37.400
That's an easy question to answer because it's like a credit card bill

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.400
that you buy control.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:48.400
If you asked me, you have to die at 12 a.m.,

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:52.400
is it going to be by your own hand or by a stranger?

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.400
Would my answer change?

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.400
Because when you say, would you rather kill yourself or be killed,

01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:00.400
all I hear is control versus lack of control.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:03.400
Instead of Batman versus old roller coaster, because that doesn't make sense.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.400
You should want the old roller coaster, not Batman.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:10.400
I want to kill myself because then I get to just be like,

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.400
okay, well, maybe today, maybe tomorrow.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.400
Gladly pay you for a hamburger.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.400
That's what we're all doing.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.400
We're kind of like going like, how are you doing, Joel?

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.400
I have an idea.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.400
I was just going to say about being in situations where it's dangerous

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:30.400
and there's tension and a threat.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.400
A lot of it is gradual.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.400
You move into it slowly and you could say your job,

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.400
you could say your job is scary and there's a lot of tension.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:42.400
There's a lot of money getting thrown around and you have to make a show.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:47.400
And for a lot of people, that would be very daunting and you gradually moved into it.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.400
And so I think that's one piece of this,

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:54.400
is just that you slowly get into more and more dramatic situations

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.400
and you always feel like you may have leverage in your pocket like a way.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.400
I felt like when I was working on community,

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:07.400
all of a sudden I'm on a network sitcom and I'm surrounded by people who are fucking pros

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.400
and I'm coming from it.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.400
I got fired from basic cable.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.400
I wasn't even able to hold myself there.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.400
I'm like, these people are diplomats.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.400
I'm on King's Landing and I'm a fucking wildling.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.400
Do you guys know what that means?

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.400
No, you were out fucking doing important shit.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.400
Game of Thrones is important shit, Dan.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.400
That's not downplaying the importance of that.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.400
And I distinctly recall, because I was like,

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:39.400
well, I've always been a piece of shit that loves having attention paid to me

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:43.400
and I did notice that the people I was the most afraid of,

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.400
because of their business acumen, because of their diplomacy,

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.400
because of their savvy, when the spotlight would hit me,

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.400
they would shrink away.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.400
They would be like, don't talk about that.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.400
No, I don't want to do an interview with them.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:04.400
I'd be like, oh, so if I'm Colonel Sanders, it's my fried chicken.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.400
Does that make sense?

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.400
So that's an example.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.400
I could picture a firefighter even going like,

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:18.400
okay, so, oh, you're scared about the idea of running into a burning building

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.400
because it's mystical to you.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:27.400
I found something that I've demystified and I can continue to explore it.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.400
That person's not going to go back and go,

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:33.400
but what about my parcheesy skills?

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.400
That person's going to continue to go like,

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.400
I want to grow in that direction.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:40.400
I want to...

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:46.400
That's helping me not hate myself for living on the same earth as you.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.400
What are you talking about?

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.400
Because I'm worried I'm not a good person, but now I realize nothing matters.

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.400
But being a good person has nothing to do with doing stuff that's like dangerous

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.400
and ill advised.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.400
You can see that because you traipse over the military zones.

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.400
Oh, who's the thing?

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.400
I live in the matrix. I love my state.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.400
No, we all live in the same city here.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.400
I get that sometimes around.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.400
No, you live on earth. You live in reality.

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.400
You're a child of God.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.400
I'm a fat, fucking horrible agent of compromise.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.400
And you know that.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:22.400
And the fact that you won't admit it makes me hate you.

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.400
There's nothing more without compromise.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.400
Kill me.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.400
So I don't have to kill myself.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.400
I know you know people with guns.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.400
I don't have the balls to get my own.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:41.400
My 10-day waiting period is plus seven months.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.400
All right.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.400
Let's roll some of that beautiful bean footage.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:51.400
Magenta, do we have stuff up here that you've photographed?

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.400
Okay.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.400
Let's look at...

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.400
I want to look at war photography.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.400
Yeah, that's what I was starting to walk...

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.400
Do you want someone getting shot?

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.400
No.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.400
Why am I saying no?

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.400
I want the part of war where everyone high-fives.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.400
Do you want to do the screening with us in Iraq?

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.400
No, we don't want to do anything.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.400
We'll keep you safe.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.400
We'll be a really nice hotel.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.400
The hotel is really nice.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:24.400
Should we go do a Harmontown in the Middle East?

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.400
Yeah!

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.400
I'm telling you, if you want to go...

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.400
We could talk about this later if you're serious,

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.400
but if you want to do a Harmontown in Arabil,

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.400
it is a safer city than Los Angeles.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.400
What if we do a Harmontown there and it's 9-11?

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.400
They didn't do 9-11.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.400
I know. I'm just saying. Wouldn't it be weird?

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:46.400
So I was like, it's 9-11.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.400
Let's just look at some pictures.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.400
You tell me, Magenta,

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.400
if you're...

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.400
The average person is like,

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.400
I don't even understand any photographer.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.400
I admire all of them.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.400
They look through a lens and they go,

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:07.400
that's a good picture as opposed to everything else I look at.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:11.400
Can you shed any verbal light on what it is

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:14.400
you're supposed to do when you want to take pictures of shit?

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.400
Shed that verbal light, y'all.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.400
Well, photography is very different.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.400
Which is why I have a chance,

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.400
because I'm a horrible photographer.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.400
I'm not a photographer.

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.400
I'm just trying this new thing out that I like.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.400
And so you can't have as much control as you want to have,

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.400
which would be awkward for you, I guess.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.400
Who is that?

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.400
If I was like, I prefer to write

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:38.400
in a tank of water hanging upside down.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.400
What are the shows that they do on the street?

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:44.400
If my script is like, that's good for a guy

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.400
hanging upside down in a tank of water.

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.400
It's like Christian rock.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.400
Can't plan Christian rock?

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:53.400
If you're bad at rock, you're still Christian.

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.400
It doesn't have to be Van Halen.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.400
You love Christ.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.400
If you're photographing Iraq,

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.400
you're like, well, there was a guy shooting at me.

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:07.400
Or a lady.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.400
It's a great place to practice.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.400
No, but I'm sorry.

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.400
I got distracted by my fucking dumb shit.

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:16.400
But there is a little bit of truth to that.

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:20.400
You're like, well, I don't want to be Ansel Adams,

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.400
because I don't know how to deal with that internal.

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.400
My therapist says, run on the engine, not the pistons.

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.400
So when you're photographing in the field,

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:34.400
are you like, do you discriminate?

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.400
Are you looking?

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.400
That's a good picture.

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.400
I'll figure it out later.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.400
So probably somewhere in between.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.400
I just do whatever I feel like doing,

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.400
and he'll be like, look that way,

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.400
and then I just start doing that.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:52.400
And it's like, and look that way is based on?

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.400
Well, some of it's like we're filming a documentary out there.

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.400
So some of it's like, oh, we need footage of this.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.400
Or I'm saying something,

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.400
and we want to get them on camera saying this,

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.400
can you get over here?

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.400
Talk about the eyes that you see in a lot of those people,

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:08.400
and how that little kid you saw in the back of the truck,

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:11.400
like sometimes people's eyes,

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.400
just like you see someone and it's like magnetic.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.400
You just get pulled to them.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.400
If you want to, you know, if you want to,

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.400
because it's audio, it's a podcast.

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.400
That's probably not interesting.

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:27.400
Some of their eyes are magnetic, I don't know.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:32.400
Have I been, maybe I've been stupid,

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.400
but you're doing all video, are you doing still photographs?

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.400
Last time we did photographs,

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.400
and so I bought the A6000 and he's like,

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.400
oh, let's make a documentary.

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:45.400
So we just bought a GoPro in Iraq at the mall

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.400
to make the documentary and use the A6000.

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.400
So you're a videographer, I have this 80s thing in my head

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.400
where it's like James Woods with a vest,

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.400
and he's like got film roles.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.400
James Woods was there.

01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.400
The right instant will end up on the cover of time

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.400
and change the way people vote.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:06.400
I mean, that's not, it's like you're getting footage

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.400
of shit that could also be on the cover

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.400
of a Harry Potter version of Time

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.400
where things on the cover move.

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.400
And do you ever use stills from your video?

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.400
A little bit.

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.400
Awesome. Let's take a look.

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:27.400
Let's look at, what would you want people to see?

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.400
Well, there's three videos that tell a little bit of the story

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.400
we were just talking about.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.400
So let's start with RPG Fire, which comes from

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:36.400
that first firefight we saw.

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:41.400
I just fired an RPG in my HTC Vive at home.

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.400
It's a VR simulator of a...

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.400
Then you can tell us how accurate this is.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:26:02.400
What the fuck?

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.400
What the fuck?

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.400
This is fake. This is the fake one.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.400
Weapons and stuff.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.400
Thousands of dollars.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.400
That's like your...

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.400
That's like Gilligan's Island tour.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.400
ISIS shot about two rounds at us,

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:16.400
and the Iraqi army fired everything that they had back at them.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.400
They were aiming...

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.400
They were pivoting towards the cameras at points.

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.400
You can see it.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.400
And then afterwards, the second video,

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.400
they had a musical number for the cameras.

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.400
It was literally like a Pirates of the Caribbean,

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.400
because there's 20-some journalists there all filming.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.400
So at the end of this, there's your little firefight.

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:35.400
You get your 20 minutes of the Iraqi army shooting at ISIS footage.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.400
Then we do a song and a dance,

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.400
and then we get you back on the bus.

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.400
And you're saying, I can't wait to break away from that.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.400
Show me the real Tijuana.

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.400
That's what you're saying.

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:44.400
This is kind of what's going on.

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.400
Okay, so have you seen the fucking beheading videos?

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.400
What happens to journalists that...

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.400
If you're dead, you don't know you're dead,

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.400
so why does it matter?

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.400
You know while you're being beheaded,

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:57.400
it takes a long time.

01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:58.400
They just use a knife.

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.400
I put together a video for Cracked before we went out there,

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.400
that was just about ISIS propaganda.

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:05.400
So I had to watch all of their beheading videos,

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:08.400
and it was like, yeah, that's a little bit intimidating,

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.400
but at the same time, you're way likelier to get killed in an airstrike,

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.400
just because one of them misses the target.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.400
So that's comforting, kind of.

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:19.400
Yeah.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.400
I did have a brief feeling.

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:25.400
I remember Easter Sunday, you guys were probably over there.

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:28.400
It was like, just because this is how...

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:35.400
What's his face from North Korea unveiled his nuclear missiles,

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.400
and it was Easter Sunday, and we went to a barbecue,

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:42.400
and all hipsters had to talk about was the idea of

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.400
what if a nuclear missile landed on Los Angeles and blew us all up,

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.400
and we definitely all agreed that that would be a way better way to go

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.400
than what would happen if North Korea wasn't in the picture,

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.400
and Trump just had his run, you know,

01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.400
because the latter would be like,

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:02.400
oh, I'm gonna have to eat a foot.

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.400
Yeah.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.400
It may or may not be my own.

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.400
I have to swing someone else's daughter as a weapon.

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.400
You want to slow cook foot.

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.400
That's the real key with a foot,

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.400
is you don't want to try too fast to cook that,

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.400
because you want to let...

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.400
You've got to peel off the cows.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.400
So those guys took you through there, and they're like...

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.400
So what's their agenda?

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:26.400
You're American journalists, and they want you to say what?

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.400
What do they want you to say?

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.400
What do you mean?

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.400
Well, if they're staging that stuff...

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.400
Hillary Clinton started ISIS.

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.400
A lot of people think that.

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.400
Wait, so I say it again, Magenta.

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.400
A big popular belief is that Hillary Clinton started ISIS.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.400
Wait, so there's nobody over there that's like,

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:47.400
well, if we show you this and that, you'll write that.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.400
No.

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.400
The Iraqi army guys want you to say

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.400
that the Iraqi army is winning the battle against ISIS,

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.400
and they're good dudes.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.400
Most of the guys we met are nice dudes.

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.400
I have nothing against...

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.400
I was really impressed with a lot of them.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.400
But they want you...

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.400
You get the same thing, whether you're talking to the Kurdish Peshmerger,

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.400
which are these ancestral mountain warriors of the Kurds,

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.400
or whether you're talking about the Iraqi army,

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.400
or the Iraqi federal police, which are basically an army unit.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.400
They all are like, we love America.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.400
We're just trying to stop the bad guys.

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.400
Please send us more weapons.

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.400
But don't you get...

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:20.400
I recently found out there's three women on the Supreme Court,

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.400
and I had made a joke about there being only one.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.400
Did you graduate?

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.400
Do you have a 200 IQ?

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.400
Don't you worry about going...

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.400
That's another reason I wouldn't go to the Middle East,

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.400
because I'd be like, I can't point to where we are on a map,

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.400
and I don't know anything about anything.

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.400
That's how you learn.

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.400
Two college dropouts right here.

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.400
You learn by just being plunged into it?

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:45.400
Yeah, guys.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:48.400
You went over there, and you're like, we'll figure it out.

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.400
Yeah, well, that's the same.

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.400
It's like what Rick says in the first episode of Rick and Morty.

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.400
It's just like that.

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:56.400
You throw yourself into situations that you don't fully understand,

01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:00.400
and then you grow as a person because you figure it out, or you don't.

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:04.400
I know, but you could have gone to Barna, man.

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.400
But you went to, like, Burning if the shit is on fire.

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:11.400
Bomb the fuck out, man.

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.400
Let's see another one.

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:16.400
You guys should see the song and dance routine they do at the end of this one.

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:19.400
It has dancing or something in there.

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.400
This is when they were...

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.400
Yeah, the dance number.

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.400
He gives a little speech first.

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.400
We probably don't need to go through the speech.

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:29.400
It's mostly about how they're sweet.

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:32.400
You want to pay attention, because we're going to see this guy again

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.400
with another clip to this dude.

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.400
This is going to be great for all the listeners.

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.400
Is that guy have a pencil mustache?

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.400
No, they can't have beards, so they really get crazy.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.400
The guys that had to shave their beards get big on the mustaches.

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.400
They're not allowed to have beards?

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.400
They didn't, because they look like ISIS.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.400
Yeah, I got a lot of shit.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.400
By the way, they thought he was ISIS every checkpoint.

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.400
They would be putting their hands on their guns, being like,

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:58.400
Dush, Dush, and it's going to be a while before the beard recovers in Iraq.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:01.400
The beard is pretty tough there.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.400
The anti-silver lake over there.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:06.400
So this guy is the colonel who's in charge of that position,

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.400
and his job is like, in the evenings and the afternoon,

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:13.400
he kills ISIS guys, and in the morning, he leads journalists on a tour.

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:17.400
And that dude behind him is like, you can watch his face during this,

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.400
because it's really interesting.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.400
He's like the guy who keeps everyone alive when they're running around.

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:24.400
He was always, whenever people were shooting at us or near shooting at us,

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:27.400
that dude always had his body between magenta and the bullets.

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.400
He's a really cool dude.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:33.400
Aya de世界 Dickboarding.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:34.400
He's flaming him.

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.400
The ISIS people are je Например aiz has came now.

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.400
He never afathled for it again.

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.400
He just faded away.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:45.400
I dint those two rzeczy.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.900
Honestly, he's saying

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.400
Poultah!

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.400
Poultah!

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.400
We can play football now?

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:58.400
Can we start?

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:13.260
What the fuck was that you said you dropped out and everybody applauded then you're like

01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:18.780
oh he's saying that a thermal gang grenade is what the fuck what do you know you're smart

01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:24.660
you're worldly you speak the other languages not mostly just badly it takes it takes a

01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:33.760
lot to be you and so we all are allowed to not be you of course I mean nobody trusts

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:37.680
me with a budget Dan so what did that guy look like what character do you look like

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:44.920
he looked like flea which one the little dance the lead guy looked like old flea oh from

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:56.220
him did you pick up did you pick up no we had it in translator who gave me the gist

01:32:56.220 --> 01:33:01.580
of that I speak a little bit of Kurdish but I my Arabic is terrible I know like eight words

01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:07.020
it's bad I would I would I would I would get off a plane over there and I would be afraid

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:11.820
to use the word Arabic because I would be I would I would assume from what I've lived

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:18.260
through I would someone go Arabic rude and I'd be like I don't know I don't know you

01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:21.900
would you would you would be you'd be off the plane like ten minutes before someone

01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:26.220
was like oh this guy clearly needs help I speak English come with me you want to crash

01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:29.900
and then I'd be like is he gonna rate me he's gonna rate me he wouldn't rape you I went

01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:33.860
to Fiji and I couldn't fucking relax like I told the story of this thing it was like

01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:37.860
there was a pool guy that was like come do this fucking low-grade ayahuasca with me

01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:42.500
in my family's village and I spent the entire car ride going they're gonna rape us but

01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:46.940
they didn't because everything different is a threat but okay so that's that's that's

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:51.300
like the thing that separates like before we ever went to a war zone we traveled a lot

01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:54.700
in parts of the world we're like we had experiences we're like you're in the car with the people

01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:57.620
that you don't really understand they're like oh is something bad gonna happen is this like

01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:01.540
the first 15 minutes of an Eli Roth movie and then we all get cut to pieces like it's

01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:07.380
something terrible and it doesn't always but when it doesn't happen five or six times

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:11.220
in a row you're like thinking about that is like you are out doesn't exist but he does

01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:22.460
yeah but he's just he's just a mediocre director no but that yeah it doesn't matter he's he's

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:27.900
probably not that gifted a writer I don't think he'd disagree with that right his stories

01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:34.460
largely have a first act of I'm so glad we're getting onto this subject that guy yeah I want

01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:39.420
to know what do we what do we need to know that we don't know like what do you see over

01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:43.980
there that we might be getting the bullshit story on here's the thing that I do want to

01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:48.340
make sure I talk about because I don't want to get off of it there's an anarchist feminist

01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:53.540
militia that are the people who are actually beating ISIS in Syria right now when when

01:34:53.540 --> 01:35:00.180
we not surprised when you hear about them on the news you'll hear like the United States

01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:05.380
government has increased its aid to the SDF the Syrian Democratic Forces 70 ish percent

01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:09.780
of the Syrian Democratic Forces are a group called the YPG the People's Protection Units

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:14.700
the YPG and their sister unit literally sister unit the YPG which is the female People's

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:19.420
Protection Units okay they are when we went to Iraq the first time we started touring

01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:22.860
all these refugee camps where there were a bunch of Yazidis survivors of the genocide

01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:27.380
ISIS carried out so these are people like I was asking about like oh hey America this

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:31.380
is the only time that the US intervened in a timely manner to help stop a genocide like

01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:34.940
ever like ISIS started killing these people and we sent in air strikes and I expected

01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:39.500
them to be like yeah we're really grateful to the United States for stopping ISIS none

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:44.180
of them had that to say they were like no it was the YPG so what happened is during when

01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:48.540
ISIS was on the move and they were expanding in Iraq and expanding in Syria and everybody

01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:52.180
was running away the Iraqi army was fleeing from them the Kurdish military was fleeing

01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:55.620
from them all the different Syrian militias were fleeing from and they were they were

01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:59.460
just growing unchecked like a giant fucking tumor in the middle of all that they're mass

01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:03.460
occurring the members of this religious sect in Iraq called the Yazidis who live in Mount

01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:09.140
Sinjar and the YPG who is again a feminist anarchist militia here's that that's happening

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:12.180
this is happening they're fighting their own desperate battle against ISIS and getting

01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:17.540
pushed back and they divert divert forces from this battle for survival to invade Iraq

01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:27.140
divert you fucking idiot he doesn't even know words this motherfucker just gave away

01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:35.100
to plot a wander woman so but so these guys these guys and ladies punch a hole in ISIS's

01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:39.700
lines in Iraq rescue tens of thousands of people avert a genocide and then leave forces

01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:44.340
behind to train a militia and the only complaint that we heard the people we talked to there

01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:48.820
make about them is that the Yazidis are a very traditional like traditional in the sense

01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:53.140
that they don't let women do a lot and they were like well they wouldn't they forced our

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.980
women to learn how to fight they gave them guns and we didn't want them to give our

01:36:55.980 --> 01:37:00.940
ladies guns and now our women have guns and it's it's frustrating to us that sounds like

01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:06.620
a like an indie movie they're like well you know it is what it is I this is going to sound

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:10.660
like a really loaded liberal question but do you think the reason we're not aware of

01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:16.300
that very very marketable phenomenon that would make a really compelling story is you

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:21.300
know do you think that's being filtered out do you think that's a threat to the first

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:28.660
world the idea that women and the men who support them not in a chivalrous way but in

01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:35.220
a fucking like like fuck it way like that that will be the solution like that that's

01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:39.300
the last thing anyone wants to hear there's a lot to be scared of in that because like

01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:44.740
when when Rojava is one of the names you'll find them under they don't go by Rojava anymore

01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:48.660
they're not a state it's like a democratic it's democracy without a state is the way

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:52.700
you'll hear it described a lot it's a weird system of government that's based around like

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:57.060
one of the things they do is they elect a man and a woman simultaneously to every political

01:37:57.060 --> 01:38:01.060
position and they have to come to an accord before anything can get decided so it's like

01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:06.940
it is actually a perfect 5050 representation and in some of these towns when they took

01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:11.460
over from the Syrian government and they were like hey ladies like we have female organizations

01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:15.660
for lady journalists we have female military units like we have female farming collectives

01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:19.980
like you're free to have a job and do whatever you want participate in politics now there

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:24.500
were some areas where the divorce rate went to like 50% from almost nothing like half women

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:29.500
they're just left their husbands like oh shit I can go do stuff now well fuck this noise

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:34.180
like I'm gonna go do shit so yeah there's definitely an element of it that's it it's

01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:38.620
a threat and there is a reason that you only hear to them referred to as the SDF rather

01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:46.180
than a feminist anarchist militia who's rabidly against the idea of states yeah bad ass it's

01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:53.260
bad ass I wanted to make sure I got in my crazy left wing street I mean there was one

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:58.380
question is there any pressure from your employers the media to show the Middle East and the

01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:03.580
specific different light than you observe but I think that's I mean you're a freelancer

01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:08.780
I mean no I'm salaried with cracked but they don't pay for us to go we just buy plane tickets

01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:19.460
they're like if you can find a bit I thought I don't know what's wrong with my tweet deck

01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:27.020
I thought I saw some shit that was like you know what tweet tweet deck I'm sweet dick but

01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:32.780
I always hear that I set up a little filter for the hashtag thing but just what do you

01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:38.060
got anything we should know that we don't already know so much to know me give me your

01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:47.300
top one as quickly as you possibly can I mean there's this one weird moment no no no god

01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:54.620
damn it I am at a podium with a microphone and I asked you a question okay I just got

01:39:54.620 --> 01:40:00.220
one thing to say for everyone here do all the shit that you just like talk about and

01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:03.020
then you put it off you don't do it and it's just a fantasy just do it because that's what

01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:07.100
I did that's what we're doing just do the shit that you wanted to do and it sounds silly

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:14.380
just worked away I was worth the weight I knew you had it in you girl I knew you had

01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:20.460
it in you we still want to know though I still want to know as a as a person who has who

01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:27.620
is three weeks into having decided to get back on the elliptical I still want to understand

01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:32.460
what it is that put me on it in the first place because I know once I was on it I wanted

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:37.020
to stay on it and I know once I got off it it got easy to stay off it but I'm trying

01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:43.180
to isolate that moment so that we can bottle it put it in a little pill that's like take

01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:48.540
action because we all know this like we hear it all the time in our own heads and we hear

01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:52.220
it from the people we admire that they're like hey that thing that you want to do just

01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:59.780
do it and it's like how you scared the first time you like wrote up a pilot or wrote with

01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:03.700
the first thing that you wrote that you submitted to somebody you respected yeah I had a chance

01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:09.060
to turn it down it's almost like that the path that led me to where I am ego ego ego

01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:15.460
like I was too fucking dumb to know how untalented I was well there you go great okay I played

01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:20.700
a lot of D&D and watch Indiana Jones movies as a kid so that was that was everything I

01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:25.140
mean it's like it's like okay yeah but it's like it's it's it's something seems scary

01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:29.900
to someone or even beyond scary if it just seems like this isn't the time to do that

01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:34.540
I get fucking gotta go to work at Starbucks yeah I gotta go work or I gotta I gotta or

01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:38.620
it just yeah it's like I got to do shit yesterday and I gotta do shit tomorrow if I even have

01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:44.780
a time to think right now then I owe it to myself to just sit here and think what in

01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:49.060
that moment like yeah yeah I'm gonna answer my own question my fucking therapist answered

01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:53.100
it it's like this never leads anywhere thought doesn't lead to action only action leads to

01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:57.660
action you said it yourself you just have to do it even though it doesn't it vexes us

01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:02.820
because we're addicted to thought we have a luxury we have we're addicted to safety as

01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:07.460
well we're addicted to just like we have the luxury of going that's what we do we're on

01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:13.340
King's Landing so we go we can't we can make a difference when we go I'd like that funding

01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:18.740
to go over here and we mistake that for meaning that as individuals it's okay for us to go

01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:27.220
well I've decided I'm a vegan or I've decided I'm left but right of this it's words and

01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:32.900
it's thoughts whereas the things that everybody in this room knows that all the shit that

01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:38.060
changed them is shit that they just did we have so much support like if you're homeless

01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:41.380
in America you're still gonna have clean water you're still gonna find a toilet you're not

01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:46.340
gonna starve like you're in America so rely on the community or the culture that we don't

01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:51.220
have and miss that week of work even if you get fired to pursue what you want to do because

01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:54.140
you're still at the end of the day gonna have a clean place to shit and at least you're

01:42:54.140 --> 01:43:00.900
a step closer to trying something different you're gonna have a clean place to shit no

01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:05.020
matter what you're in America it's fine just try some shit I can definitely but to the

01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:08.700
extent that logic is employed there I can twist that into like okay yeah so I should

01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:13.300
stay put and like I'm doing great yeah you are you are doing great so I'm not gonna do

01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:16.740
anything different tomorrow because even if I'm homeless I can shit in a clean no one

01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:21.540
makes you happy fuck you guys don't high road me no one's telling me to do anything

01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:26.300
different we all want season four the bottom line is yeah like there it is how you met

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:33.020
Joel I was I move what what I because I moved you just fucking did it you moved I was dropped

01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:39.140
it and I hitched to ride on his U-Haul I've taught you guys I'm golem like I like a ring

01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:47.180
fell near me and I was like this is precious and then one day it fell away with no matter

01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:51.140
where it fought that's when I move I go well this is less precious I want the precious

01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:56.940
back like that's all I've ever done that's all I do okay you got it well who doesn't

01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:02.300
that describe that doesn't describe you you fucking yeah well it's a whole planet of

01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:07.460
golem that's the whole that's not golem when you go to the Middle East golem never goes

01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:14.220
to the Middle East I mean there's kids that are starving and then you go have some fancy

01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:17.620
fucking meal at night every night when you're out there like a shit head doing that you're

01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:22.140
just doubling down on the golem would never do that you'd be like no those kids make me

01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:27.420
uncomfortable I'm gonna go eat fish in a cave those kids don't have any fish Dan the golem

01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:30.660
doesn't care he doesn't want to think about that he wants his precious to think about

01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:35.620
it we all want our precious no you want photo journalism yeah but that's not feeding the

01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:44.340
kids that you see over there that's not bad is that place that golems in the middle earth

01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:49.620
that's just the goblins mountain golem the worst place is that golem hangs out and mortar

01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:57.460
because that's where he found a comfortable place all right look let's Annie let's just

01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:04.340
accept that we're all we're all equidistant from transformative human evolution so you

01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:09.500
guys really aren't that much better than me well why is there not there's real see what

01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:16.420
about this and I learned earlier I'm just like John Sweden because I don't make a community

01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:24.820
movie I'm fucking nailing it no sorry I it's not like skydivers are better you're not like

01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:29.900
yelling at skydivers are you just like that's what gets them off I silently judge skydivers

01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:35.740
I do well why because they needlessly risk death in a world where life is precious that's

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:42.220
where I find them atrocious people well nobody needs us but you go on roller coasters yeah

01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:50.500
at least I don't I do it so that my friends don't judge me I'm judging you can I say

01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:54.700
something man I think one thing is that it's about bravery a little bit it's a kind of

01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:59.140
about doing good work you know that's what they're doing that's what I know you aspire

01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:03.020
to do that's like kind of part of your problem is you want to be good at what you do to be

01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:08.500
glorified well maybe but you also really like know it's edifying for people I mean these

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:12.780
guys are watching your shows when they're in a dangerous place I'm recognizing that I

01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:20.340
do good work yeah I feel glorious okay well that's all I got what I mean I how many writers

01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:29.700
do you think say they do it to be glorified you're right I am special yeah thank you Spencer

01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:36.100
I owe it to the world to share my worldview well it's I think I think it's about time

for us to wrap up I thank you guys so much for coming in here and thank you Ivan is Ivan

01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:11.180

01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:23.060
