00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This show was filmed on location at Brazos Hall during South by Southwest, sponsored by Yahoo!

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Please put your hands together for the rap stylings of your mayor, Mr. Dan Harlan!

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
From the day I saw your face

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Oopsie, I did fucked up

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Toot, toot, beep, beep, toot, toot, toot, toot, family

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
We are in Austin, toot, toot, toot

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Put your woman in the basket with a laundry and a shoe

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
My name is MC John

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
My name is MC John

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm here to mow the lawn

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I put your panties on

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
When you're out and the lights aren't on

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I sneaked into your room

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
I was inside your room

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Okay, stop

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Terrible

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Off to a terrible start

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Terrible, misogynist, to horrible, clinically disgusting show

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
You can't rhyme room with anything but womb

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
And no one wants to think about the womb when you're in a sexual way

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
The womb is its own thing

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
You don't want it to associate it with the sexual act

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
You want to associate it with life

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
And Texas

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Thanks for having us back

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Austin, the Portland of Texas, as I call it

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
You guys are fantastic

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Thanks for waiting around and coming here

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
We're here in Austin because we're premiering

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
our sixth season of my little show, Community

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
There's a little bit of overlap there between the audiences

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
for Community and the podcast

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
How many people here are strictly here just for Community?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
By applause

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
It's a podcast, don't raise your hands

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
That doesn't get us anywhere

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Okay, how many people here are just die-hard Harmontown fans

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
and don't give a shit about Community?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
You know what I'm saying?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Don't give a shit about Community

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
I'm just trying to find the polls here

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
You're trying to stir shit up

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
You want a rumble

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
What'd you say, sir?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Okay

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
The talk-back format might not work as well

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
We found Texan shy Adam Goldberg

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Wait, no! What's that?

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
The postman only rings once

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Also, you don't have a doorbell

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
He's yelling

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I don't know what that saying means

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
I got nothing, so it's going to be a bad show

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
but we'll be done about 8.30

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Wait, look at all of the...

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I just walked in the back door and came out here

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
and more money has been spent

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
promoting Community in this room

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
than in five years

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
And by that, I mean there's two vinyl signs

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
and some balloons

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
which is huge

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
It's a 500% increase in the marketing budget

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
for our show

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
It's pretty crazy

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Yahoo has been a very strange experience

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
for everybody on that sad little show

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
that has really become accustomed to...

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I don't know if I'm supposed to address the sirens

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
or just ignore them

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I don't know what a master performer would do

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
work the sirens into the thing

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
I don't know, the sirens are here

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
What are you doing out here?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
What's all this?

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
It's a police officer

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Anthony jesslenick had a pretty good one

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
He was doing a thing and the siren goes outside

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
You can barely hear it on the recording

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
and he says, that's how hard I'm killing

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I just stole some guys' joke

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
You credited him

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
What was I talking about?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Oh, Yahoo's great

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
You're saying it was strange for the cast

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It's been a weird experience for them

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
They're being treated like a cast of a TV show?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, I mean...

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
You would think it was 1995

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
and that we were getting a free rating

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
or something in the way that Yahoo

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
talks to the cast and stuff

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
They talk about doing Emmy campaigns

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
and promoting the show and stuff like that

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
I've told this story before

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
but Kathy Sabat, the CMO

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
of Yahoo came to the set and visited

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
and she was like, gathered the cast around

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
and was just filling them in on what we were going to be doing this year

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
and ten minutes into it

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
she noticed that they were being really quiet

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
and she was like, are you guys...

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
am I offending you or something?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
and then Ken Jong went, really sincerely

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
you have to understand, no one's ever talked to us like this before

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
and it was really sad and delightful

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
but it is like, there's no enemies now

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
and I don't know if it's going to have a positive

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
or a negative impact on the contents of the show

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
because I just work on it

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
and now all of a sudden it's like

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
okay, well...

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I have no...

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah, if there's no Death Star

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
there's no Darth Vader up there

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
why leave Tatooine, man?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah, why not just make a show

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
about going to Mos Eisley

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
and when that guy says like

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
I don't like you either, you go like

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
well, why don't you get to know me?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
and then you just like move into an apartment with him

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
and the...

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
there could be structural issues with this season

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
is what I'm saying

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
we got a B plus in Entertainment Weekly

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
No, no

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I sleep on my office couch

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
this is an A minus show

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I don't know what they give AAs to

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
How many nights a week are you sleeping on the office couch?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
All of them?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Literally all like week

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
like Erin just like

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
just hit a tipping point where she was like

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
we either had to

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
identify this as a problem

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
and therefore solve it with divorce

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
or we had to like look at this as like

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
this is what it's going to be

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
until we're done shooting

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
and so like there'll be days where I just like

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
okay, going to sleep on the couch

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
and then I'll wake up and work on the show

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
but now I feel self-conscious talking about that

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
because you're going to watch it and you're going to be like

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
you slept on your couch?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
It's just a karate kid joke

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I could have got home by

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
three at least

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
alright but

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I want to

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I want to bring out Spencer right away

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Dan, I'm going to start from the top

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
You ready?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I know you have troubles with the intro here

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
No, it's like you're going to start right away

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I can wait one bar

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I can wait one bar

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
as long as you want

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
State the one wherever you

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
It's always on the one man

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Spencer make yourself comfortable

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I like that they've given you a nice

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Barcelona chair

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Is that what you call this? Is this a Barcelona chair?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I believe it's a reproduction of what they used to call

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
a Barcelona chair

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Who is it by Miller or Knoll or something

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Oh well this is an Ikea article

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
No, it's not an original one

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I think they call it a Flonox

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
A Flonox

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
They call it a Stubnortz

08:10.000 --> 08:38.000
Alright Dan, Spencer rap

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Okay stop it

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
You're right

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You're right

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
What's happening up here is entertainment

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
You're right

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
You're not going to burst that bubble

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
You are certainly right to applaud and woo for that

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
That certainly wasn't what would have happened

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
if your uncle had come up here

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
with a drink in his hand

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
This is nothing like just one of your weddings

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
What's going on

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
It's actual entertainment

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
that's worthy of being broadcast and paid for

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
You're absolutely right

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
So you're still rockin'

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
the flannel

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
even though it's a little arid out here

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Oh it's quite arid out here Dan

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
That sigh wasn't for you

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
It was for me

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Are we going to

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
play something tonight

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I don't care

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
I was thinking maybe we could start off

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
with some checkers

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
move into some tag

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
We'll figure it out

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Do you have a B in your bonnet

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
politically, socially, or economically?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Oh man

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I don't know

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Okay so I listened to this radio station

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
that's big claim to fame

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
as they're always talking about how commercial

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
free they are

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Well every commercial break

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
they say commercial free

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
It's stupid as fuck

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
but the worst thing is they go commercial free

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
starting now

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
they play one song and then they do two minutes of commercials

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
That's literally the opposite of commercial free

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And this is the selling point of the station

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
is that they're commercial free

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
They're saying they're commercial free

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
but there are commercials

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
They're saying they're commercial free one song

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
before playing a three minute block of commercials

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
More commercials than music

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Bullshit

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
So they're just letting you know the commercials are over

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
for the time being

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
But you'd also know that

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
if you started hearing the song being played

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Why are you listening to radio

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
You're a star child

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Why do you even know about radio?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
You know

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Sometimes my

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Apple watch is broken

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
It was really tragic

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
when the Apple watch got announced

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Are you gonna get an Apple watch?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
No, it's pretty dumb if we're honest

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Too soon

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
It's all about that

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Galaxy wear

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Is that what they call

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Samsung

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
wrist

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
We're not in some way

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
affiliated with Samsung today

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Are we?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I know sometimes that happens

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Good riff

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
about the Uber

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
sexual harassment

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
The president of Uber said

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
you're welcome for the catering

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Oh shit

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I didn't even have any of that catering

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I sat in front of a guy

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
on the flight out here

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I walked on the plane

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
and the first guy I see Robert Duvall sitting on the plane

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
that was very cool

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
and he looked bummed out, he didn't like it

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
He looked like he was not happy to be coming to South by Southwest

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
What do you think that would sound like

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
if Robert Duvall was bummed out on a plane?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I'm on a big, big titted plane

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
It's a big titted plane

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
But then I go back

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
and I'm sitting way back in steerage

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
and there's two guys behind me

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
and I

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
it was like sitting in front of two abeds

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
from community

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
and they were out abetting each other

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
so I did this, cool, cool, cool

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
and one of the guys worked for Samsung

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I know that because he said it nine fucking

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
thousand times during that time

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
at one point actually I got him and said

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
do you guys mind

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
they were talking full, like, louder than I'm talking

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
right now on a plane full of adult people

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
How loud

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
in comparison to how loud

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
the audience is talking right now

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
are they talking?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Oh

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Can you

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
have

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Every time we come to South by Southwest

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
we're always somehow in a room

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
where there's an auction happening

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Are we at a fud ruckers?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
What the fuck is going on?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I don't understand

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Are we double booked?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Is there a bachelor party?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I know it can't be anyone's fault

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
but who the fuck is talking?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
What is going on?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
The last time we did it

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
we booked it and I thought oh I guess that's

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
this room like the last place it's all brick

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
and glass and nothing but reflective surfaces

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
and it's

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
The last place there was an excuse because

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
it was literally just a hotel lobby

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
like anyone could be there

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
like I don't know how people get in

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
but apparently there's a lot of trouble

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
from some people trying to get in so

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
there's no excuse

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
We could come down hard on these people

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
and say it could be quiet but then we'd have to replace that silence

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
with entertainment

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
That's the thing, that's why I don't complain

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
because I'm not going to be like hey shut up over there

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I'm trying to do what

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
you're doing

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
but in a more

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
entitled way

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
We're being heckled by the people that want

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
to listen

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I can't

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I can't

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I can't

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
That emperor is naked

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
If you don't know, I mean, come on

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Wait, come on, what are you doing?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Are you on the staff?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Oh you're just wearing a

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Okay

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
What the fuck is happening?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I feel like

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Harmontown has crossed a threshold

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
We've been so laissez-faire

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
about letting the

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Hey everybody at the bar, shut the fuck up

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
It's not going to work

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I love you, I love you

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
If you want to be a part of it, come up

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
and grab a mic, let's meet you

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Sightline guy, get on stage

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
South by Southwest

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Going to meet a person

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
How are you? Your name is Jordan

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I see you on your tag

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Is it on?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
We're on

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
How are you guys doing? My name is Jordan

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
What's your Twitter account?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Don't tell them not to boo you

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Apologies, apologies

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Boo if you like

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Don't boo him

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I'm sorry

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I shouldn't tell you what to do

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Alright Jordan, why are you at South by Southwest?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I'm at South by Southwest

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
because me and my partner

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Ryan Brown, we are starting an alcohol delivery app

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
It's called Top Shell

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Are you just up here to plug your own shit right now?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
He asked me

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
He asked me

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Wait, wait, wait Jordan

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I'm going to ask you a question, I want you to be very honest with me

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Yes sir

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
You were standing over on the sidelines, standing up

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
on the stage right edge of the stage

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
and you said tweet me, are you giving me a tweet shout out

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
No, no, I asked for his Twitter handle

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
so we could tweet him

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
So you could tweet him? Yes

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Because that would get Dan what, a million more followers

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
or what happened?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
No, no, I said I liked him

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
because I thought he was funny

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And at the moment you get on stage

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
you start shilling your product

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
No, not at all

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I don't know how much of a crime that is

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
South by Southwest

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
has been infiltrated by capitalist interests

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
the secret's out

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
There's not a lot of people here

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
for the spiritual

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
edification of it

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
You've got to give me some fairness here

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
You did ask me, didn't you? Yes, it's an honest answer

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
You're here because of this product

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I feel ironically compelled

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
to stick up for anybody who's being

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I feel like we

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
let you on stage in the same way the Germans

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
let the troops at Normandy on the beach

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I feel like

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
you were coming up here

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
No matter how

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
that was too soon, I'm sorry

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
disagree, I thought it was

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I feel like we have been ambushed here, Dan

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I'd like to hear more about his alcohol

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
distribution app that

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Who doesn't like

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
to drink, right?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
We're all drinking here? I don't like a drink

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
What do I do with your app?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I don't drink

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Yeah, so

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
What's in it for me?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Do you do weed? What's that?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
You should do weed

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
We do do weed

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Eventually

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
We're not there yet

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
What is the app?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Is it like a yummy.com

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
like you deliver booze to people?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
So you get on the app

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
We connect with your local liquor stores

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
and we display their inventory

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
on your iPhone

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
So basically you can scroll through

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
say I want a bottle of Jamison, a six-pack

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
and we bring it to you in under an hour

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
So whether you live in Texas

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
or wherever

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Now you're not the one driving

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
when they bring it, right? No, we actually

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Because you've been using this app all day

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Yes!

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Which is fine, like you're a spokesman for it

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I've been walking, Uber is awesome

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Yeah, so

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
it's like one of those

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
it's another one of those, not to trivialize it

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
It's another kind of peer-to-peer

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
No, that's not the word

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It's a fucking thing that delivers

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
alcohol

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It's like a

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
pink elephant or I don't know what's

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
local or what's, what was the

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
gizmodo

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
bling bling

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Grubhub, Grubhub, Grubhub

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
It's like Grubhub for booze!

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Why is there a show tonight

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
like an episode of Price is Right? Everyone's yelling shit out

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Hey, come on!

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
It's an infomercial

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Now I don't know about you, but

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
every time I want to get drunk

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I'm always too far away from the booze

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
There you go

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Great, yeah

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Alright, well thank you Jordan for

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Jordan, Jordan

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I'm going to let you guys get back to the show

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I really do appreciate you guys

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Jordan real quick, Jordan real quick

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
We'll give you a plug, what's the name of the app again?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Top Shelf

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
You can follow us on Instagram

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
We're just at Top Shelf

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Okay, Jordan's pretty simple

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Jordan, you're a booze delivery professional

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Right? Oh, oh yeah

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Lots of training

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
And we allowed you up on stage

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
We plugged your product, right?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Now Jordan, do me a favor

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I know, I have like a double bullet ride on the rocks

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Go grab me a drink

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Will you get it for Jeff?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
The reputation of your company is on the line

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I'm on the way baby

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
We're timing him, time him

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Someone's going to stop watch

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Play some music

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
How long it takes him to bring you liquor

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Look, he's really doing it

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Hey Jordan, tick tock

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
We're getting a lot of gestures

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Oh

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Looks like new media has failed us again

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Well my name is Top Shelf

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
You ain't getting a motherfucking drink

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
No way, I can't get you a booze

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Can't get you a drink

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Jesus Christ

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I didn't ask for a goddamn beer

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Jordan, I asked for a bullet ride

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
On the rocks

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
This is

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Jack Daniels on the rocks, go Jordan

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Go

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Jack Daniels

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
No liquor here guys

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Cheers

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Jordan, you know you should do

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
If there's no whiskey here, you should use your app

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Unfortunately, our app is not live

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Until this next Friday

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Wait, I gotta

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Just Jeff

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
No

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I'm not waiting six days for a drink Jordan

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
You are the Uber of booze apps

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
We have launched, we've asked Apple

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
They rejected

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Our advance

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
We tried to make it

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
But we're coming

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Well my grandpa lied about his age so he could fight in World War II

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
We're American

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I don't know what that means

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Alright Jordan, give me that beer

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Thank you for Jordan everybody

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Jordan and Top Shelf

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Come on, it's a weird world

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
And it's a new generation

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Taking the battle to the streets

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
There's 300 million of us

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And our economy is going to be fine

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Because it's in those hands

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Our nation has determined

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
It refuses to lift things

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Manufacture things, export things

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
But we're on it, we're an innovation

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Economy

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Dreamers, that's going to pay the rent

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Can I just say

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Did anyone else find it weird that his business

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Only had an Instagram account

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Like I feel like you start with Twitter

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Facebook, right

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Instagram is

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I don't know, I don't know

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Alright, I got a special guest

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
That I wanted to chat with

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Let's bring him up first

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Ladies and gentlemen

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
My partner

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
The shelf to my Top Shelf

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Dot com

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Who years ago

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
At South by Southwest said

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Let's come up with an app that delivers

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Entertainment to people upon request

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
So we started making this show together

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Please welcome

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
The other executive producer of

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Community, Chris McKenna

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
There he is

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
Coming from the day I met Chris McKenna

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I knew he was the one

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Look at this leisurely walk of the stage

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
He's a giant Irish man

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
That lacks the fun

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Family, family, family

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Chris McKenna's here

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Chris McKenna's here

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Take a mic at any seat you like

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Yes

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Hey Jordan, he just gave me a sip of whiskey

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Jordan, he has another podcast to ambush

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Is it on?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Is that guy just walking around town

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Storming stages?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Check

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
There's a tiny switch there

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
But my hands are full

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Check

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Tiny, delicate fingers of Jeff Davis

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Thank you

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Chris McKenna, I like the way that

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
That was just a sip

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
It was not for you

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Get an app

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I thought you were just setting it down

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Sure

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Somebody keep your eye on the time

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Can we bring Harmon Dino

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Hybrid up on stage real quick in the front row

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Will you come up on stage sir?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Can we get Dan?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Reading Rainbow

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
You're just talking about that guy

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Only if he wants to

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Do you want to come up on stage

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Or at least just stand up

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
This guy looks a little bit if Dan Harmon

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
and Dino Stamatopoulos had a child together

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
If

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Barbara and some community and Dan

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Had a love child

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I can fiddle with that mic

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Here Dan

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Rainbow

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Yeah

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Jeff is saying we're feeding this

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
On video right, so some people can

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
This is exciting, no it's not a live stream

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Today Dan

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
So Jeff is saying you look like

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
If me and Dino had a baby

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Alright

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
She knows

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
What's your name?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Use the mic

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Yeah

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Like an ice cream

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Is it working?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Also you were brought on stage

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Because of how you look

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
That's working

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
You got a

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Reading Rainbow shirt

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Yup

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
It's Jordan

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Reading Rainbow

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Jordan's back everybody

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
He's got to be in his backpack

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Oh

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Jordan just brought me

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
A full bottle of bullet rye whiskey

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I take it all back

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
That was pretty quick

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
There's another app

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Called the Austin police

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
You know

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
That don't allow that by the way

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
As you notice there's no kettle up here

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Or even Tito's

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I'm allowed to receive gifts if I don't open them up on stage

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
It's unopened so that should be fine

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Alright

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Well thank you Mike

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Unless you have something you'd like to plug

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I think you should

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Thank you Jordan

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
That'll be all

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
Jordan, wait, table 5 needs bread

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
That's Jeff's joke

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Thank you Mike

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Mike's got an app too

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Alright

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Who wants to ask Chris McKenna

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
A question about community

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Dan is going out into the audience

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
With his little baby run

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Raise your hand if you've got a question

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
For Chris McKenna

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Executive producer of community

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Alright

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I like this guy

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
What's your question for Chris McKenna

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Who's made community what it is

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
What's your favorite episode

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Boring

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
What is your favorite episode

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
You mean of community or just any TV show of all time

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Obviously of community

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
The French diplomacy episode of news radio

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Okay, alright, moving on

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
This guy's

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Second

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Dungeons & Dragons

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
My wife and I, we tweet, we do whatever we can

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
To the sponsors of the community

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
In the past, we still want to do it moving forward

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
So moving forward

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
What can the fans do to help support community

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
As we rock on

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I get asked that so often

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
That you're getting tired

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Of hearing my response

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I have no idea

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I love it and watch it

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Are people supposed to just watch TV

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
When did we let them trick us

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Into thinking that we needed to work for our television

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Like a bunch of fucking proletes

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
In an Orwell novel

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
1984

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Dan, name another

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Orwell animal farm

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Moby Dick, bitch

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
No, honestly

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Yahoo said when they came on

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Look, tell everyone to back off

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Back the fuck off

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
This is all us

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Tell the fans

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Just watch it

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I hope you guys enjoy it

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
And if you love it, talk about it

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
With your friends

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
We don't want to enlist you guys

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Just love it

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
But when you do talk about it, don't do that thing with your face

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
You know what I'm talking about

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
You don't

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
What's your question

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
And answer

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
A themed period

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I hope it's about Wieners

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
What's your favorite physical feature

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Of Dan Harmon

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
It is about Wieners

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
That's good

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
You don't even have to answer, Chris

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I'm doing a montage in my head

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
All of them

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I want to take every element

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And then do this to it

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
You put the dead eyes

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
I think the dead

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
The dead stare

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Let's mix up the all male

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
With a female question

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I bet it's going to have eyelashes and a pink bow

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
This question

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Is there any

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
You can muster what

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
It's kind of related

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Did you watch Gillian Jacobs on Girls?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I have not seen Gillian on Girls

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
But I love the idea of her being on it

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
No, I did not

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Did you see Gillian on Girls?

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I did not

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
That really was a female question

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Yeah, I know

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
I felt like a stereotype

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Will you say hey to Megan

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Because she's dying that she's not here

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Will you say hey to Megan

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Because she's dying that she's not here

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
All right, hey Megan

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
We miss you

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
We know you're that thing going on

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
We're all pulling for you

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Some of us

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
More than less

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
But anyway, Megan

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Call me

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Wow, this is really

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Yeah, this is working out

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
This is Gans, right?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
By the way, the show is so much better offstage

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I don't know why

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
All right, let's get Hanson Patton as well to ask

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
If you were in front of a room full of people

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
And had to rank the Rocky Training Montages

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
From worst to best

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
What would you do?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Oh boy

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I'd rack my brain for all the Rocky Montages

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I guess

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
The one with the chicken?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Yeah, the chicken one's got to be the best one

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
But then you had

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
The Carl Weathers one

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I like the one on the beach

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
On the Venice Beach

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
What about the one where they're intercutting it with Ivan Drago

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
And Rocky's like doing like

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Out in the snow doing real shit

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Like high-tech 1990s

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Or late 1980s

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Punches a robot in the steroid

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
It's at the height of like

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Ragonomics, it's like we're the underdogs

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Because the Russians have all of this

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Amazing equipment

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
And poor little American Rocky

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Has to train with a stick

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
If you've ever seen

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
The Russian arcade games

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
You know

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
They were all like top flight

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
On top of all of their electronics

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
We really like

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
I think we all miss the Cold War now

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Even people that weren't born during it

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Because they must watch like movies and TV

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
From the Cold War era and go man that was so

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Simple and innocent

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
There was just a bunch of other white people

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
You were kind of mad at

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
And so you made spy thrillers about it

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
The only people that got hurt

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Were people that their countries were too hard to pronounce

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
To be on the news

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
It was great

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
To watch movies

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Supposed to be suddenly worried about

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Like ducking and covering

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Right? Yeah

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
The idea that the world was at stake every

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
All day because it was just about coke and Pepsi

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
So simple

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
And then those towers came down

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Oh that's funny

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
What a generation

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Or the wall came down

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
And then it was like movies like

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I don't know what is it the dream team

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Yeah dream team I think

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Was a response to the Berlin Wall

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Coming down I'm pretty sure

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Night breeders?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
I think it's just night breed

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
They don't care nobody cares

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
That ends the segment

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Ask Chris McKenna a question

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I'm so sorry

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
No it's just they don't

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
They don't care about night breed I've talked to them about it

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
They don't care and they don't care about

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Race either that's really frustrating

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Speaking of how are you sir

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
You're raising your hand

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
How many meow meow beans

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Does Dan Harmon get

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Okay that's a bonus question

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
For you how many meow meow beans

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Well

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I don't know

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
It's kind of a gotcha question

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
It is because you know he's a man of the people

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
So we should be a one or a two

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Right

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
But he's a secret elitist so

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Six

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Alright now that definitely

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Ends the segment

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Why you pointed at him

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
You had a really good question

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
He has

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
He pointed at his beard

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Chris are you going to be playing

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Shadowrun tonight

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Oh

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Oh

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I wish I could take a picture

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Oh wait I've seen

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I know the answer that sir

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
We're actually going to bring Jordan back up

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Is that the book I keep on seeing you with

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
I would love to

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I've not been invited

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Do you guys notice how unanimously the crowd

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Instantly didn't like Jordan when he came up

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
A unanimous booing right off the bat

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I don't know

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I don't know if this show has ever had a villain

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
But that guy seems like

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Absolutely

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
The show's had a lot of villains but he really took the cake

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
He was hard-bucked there from Die Hard

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
I feel like we're trading down

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Because last time I was in Austin here

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
We had the guy that came up and talked about Bitcoin

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
And he was amazing

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
And he smelled good but he was doing the same thing

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
That Jordan was doing

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Yeah but he was dynamic and awesome

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And he smelled like delicious candy too

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Yeah

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
It has to be observed that the guy

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
He slid into that role and then he came back

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
And when everybody

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
He came back with his backpack and then everyone was like

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Waaaboo

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
And we never felt more alive

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
The coolest thing about the Top Shelf app

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Is that I'm not paying for this whiskey

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
It's totally free

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I've been a community since season one

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
If there's anything that you need

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
To be more alive, it's a villain

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Yeah

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
You absolutely need a villain

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
You've been surrounded by them

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
By communities

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Yes, and Harmontown needs a villain

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
It makes it better

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
There's no villain at Yahoo

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
There's no overlord that you're fighting against

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
No, we're scraping around looking for one

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
There was a security guard

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
That was bugging us for a while

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
And there's that guy who won't

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
That's some low-stakes potatoes

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
There's a guy who won't steam clean the floors

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Fuck that guy

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
There is a guy

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
At CBS Radford that says

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
That we keep pouring our coffee on the concrete

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
And he doesn't want to steam clean the concrete

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Because we pour our coffee on it

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
He's insane

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Can you imagine if a janitor was like

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I saw that guy litter, I'm not gonna do my job anymore

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Also, nobody pours coffee on concrete

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
He's making it up

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
That's where the garbage guy puts

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
The garbage bags and all the garbage juice leaks

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Under that spot

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
We're the ones that are there 24 hours a day

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Concrete steamer can

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Fuck off

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I mean, I'd steam clean

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
They could pay me to steam clean the concrete

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I'd do it for fun, it sounds fucking amazing

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I know

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Doesn't it sound fun just to do once

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Being a DJ or a teacher

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Just do it for an hour, steam clean concrete

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
It sounds really cool

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Okay, maybe I'm wrong

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
No, you're absolutely right

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I'd also like to tar a driveway

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Tar a driveway?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Yeah, just for like 20 minutes

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Just the tar, no asphalt on top

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Just lay the tar down

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
This is amazing, I don't know

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
What do you do, if I don't put anything underneath

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I believe tar is the adhesive

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
That holds the top surface

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
And what's the top surface made out of

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Just driveway material?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
It's cement, isn't it?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
What can't be

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
See, this is amazing

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
You don't put rebar on a driveway, madam

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Rebar?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
There's rebar in a driveway?

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Really?

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Superhighway?

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Think about it, bars are heavy

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Sorry

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
You're right

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
If you have

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
One more thing to say about rebar

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
You have to come up

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Do you have more opinions about rebar?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
No

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I took too long to explain that

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I was just saying

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
You'd have to come up if you

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
You appear to have a walker

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I don't know that we could get you up on stage for that thing

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Are you wounded? What happened?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
My spine is collapsing

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Your spine is collapsing?

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Now you have to come up

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
No, you can't

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Sorry, I don't know how much you can hear

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
What you can't hear

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
This young lady started talking about rebar pipe

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
You can't hear you

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
She has a walking device

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
She has it because her spine is collapsing

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
This is a story

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
That we want to hear

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Just sit at the edge of the stage

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Stand with her

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
We're getting you a mic

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Are you comfortable there?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
We're not making you do things that

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
What's your name?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Annie

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Annie's spine is collapsing

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
What does that mean?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I have something called

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Degenerative Spinal Stenosis

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
What happened was

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
In December, I stopped being able

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
To walk

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
That really sucked

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Was there an event

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
That Stephen Hawking story

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Where he's walking down the stairs

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
There's one moment where you're like

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I really wish it was more interesting

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
I fell down in my hallway

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I was carrying some laundry

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Stephen Hawking was just a stairwell

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
You're just as interesting as him

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
That's perfect

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
You're walking in your hallway

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
And then you lost your ability to walk

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Literally

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
I was stuck there for a few hours

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I was in so much pain I couldn't move

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I also have something called sciatica

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
And when I get it I also can't walk

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
So I was thinking that's what it was

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
So I had to crawl to a phone

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Which was really fun

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
With your arms like Stephen Segal

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
It was like war zone

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Without all the excitement

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Then I went to the hospital

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
And I was in the hospital for a few weeks

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
And they said

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
The stenosis thing

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Which is a phrase I've heard

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
You know that sound I make when I laugh

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
They think

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
That's like

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
It has something to do with cartilage

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Getting thinner or something

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
In the back

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
You know how old people bend over

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
As they get older and they're leaning

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
You see them on their walkers

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
And they look like they're all hunched

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
That's actually because their spines are falling apart

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Because the cartilage

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Why am I getting so clinical?

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
What's the payoff of me understanding it?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
I got it! Good night!

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Phone's coming together

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
The important thing is the emotional side

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
How old are you?

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I'm 30

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Even if you were 70

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
It's too long to find out one day

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
That walking is behind you

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
No, totally

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
They don't want to operate on me

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Because I'm young

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Because they can fuck that up

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
And I would never be able to do anything

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Ever again

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
They could paralyze me with the surgery

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
That I would need to correct this

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
So now

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
What's the word prognosis?

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
What can you expect?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Well

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I have to keep going to physical therapy

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Using this beautiful thing

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
And

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I take a lot of pain medication

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I get a lot of injections into my spine

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Is it going to get worse and worse?

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Yeah, it's degenerative

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
It's not going to get any better

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
I can make the symptoms better

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Can I actually have a sip of this?

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I was just going to tell you

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Jordan's giving you a free account to Top Shelf

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
When it's actually working

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
I would really need that, frankly

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
It is the least we can do

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
With medications, I get dry mouth really easily

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
And now you're talking to me

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
You said you could pill mouth

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Sorry, I misheard that

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
I take a lot of medications

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
So I can dry hump easily

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
That's not what she said

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Also true

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
The doctors will not operate under there

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Worried they could affect her ability to dry hump

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
That's the last thing that

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
That's the last thing I really want

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
If I couldn't dry hump anymore

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Life wouldn't be worth living

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Are you a dry hump fan?

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
You like your dry humping?

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I think it's underrated

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I think it is

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
If you get a good dry hump

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
That's a good night

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Absolutely

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
If you get a good dry hump

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
That can almost be better than good oral sex

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I agree

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I think you're probably impressing people a lot

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
With your radiance

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
In the face of something that a lot of people could use

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
As an excuse to be a pretty crabby person

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Thank you

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
That's all that dry humping

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I do my best not to be an asshole

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
If there's anything we could do

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
In the context of a show

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
That otherwise has no direction anyway

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
We would actually be thankful

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
If you just gave us something to do

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Is there anything

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Some kind of fantasy

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
On this like the podcast?

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Yeah

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I'm a master improviser

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I can create scene work

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Worlds within worlds

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Aw man

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I'd love to see you guys

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Improvise like a character ship

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Like

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Creating fan fiction on

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Have you ever seen the erotic fan fiction live thing

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
That happens in LA?

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
No

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Erotic fan fiction live?

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Yeah it's like a podcast thing

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
It's somewhere

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
So it's like somebody is like

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Skully and then someone's like

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Kirk and they just get on stage together

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Exactly it's like

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I think it's also competitive

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
It's like competitive erotic fan fiction

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Like what this is

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I'd like to see you and Chris

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Do a little erotic community fan fiction

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Yeah I would totally love that

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
And I think we should

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Use your favorite characters

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Who do you want to see us do?

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Well okay so

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
I actually am in costume

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Right now my favorite character is Annie

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Oh your name is Annie

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
You're gonna say you're kind of dressed like Annie

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Yes it's true it's sad but true

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I have a blog actually

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
About Annie's costumes

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
It's literally Annie's clothes

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Have you had that for years and years?

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
No I actually just recently started it

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Because I've been cosplaying Annie for years

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
What did you think about season 5

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Annie?

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I fucking hate pants and I want them to die

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I'm in such a difficult position

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
There because I love Annie the way she

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Always was but I also don't want to

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I don't want to freeze her in time

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Dresses and cardigans

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
It's such a winning combination

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
And now silk shirts what the fuck

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Damn

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Like

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
I did a blog post

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Of the whole season 6 promo

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
That was just released the age of yahoo thing

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Like almost every single frame

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Is a silk shirt

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Do you know how hot silk shirts are?

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Ridiculous

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
First of all I'll just say

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Nobody was more pained than me

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
To tell Annie to stop dressing

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Like the way that we met her

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
But I felt like I was liking it for the wrong reasons

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
And so I

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Like I felt like she was supposed to grow

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Up because and I felt like

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I would see people that were watching the show

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
They're growing up with Annie and they're like

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
I didn't want her to continue to be like this thing

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
But okay so here's the thing

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Because your spine is collapsing

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
And because you're a good person

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
And because you like her

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
For the right reasons

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Now I have the excuse to say

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
We have two episodes left to do

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
For the finale

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Annie will start wearing

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Mid like above the knee

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Floral

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Just dictate it and take it down

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
And I'll go to wardrobe

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
Yes

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
We can do this this is very easy

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
They have a room full of clothes

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
And you can just dictate

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I have a patent paper and

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
This is fans effecting change

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
So okay from top to bottom

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
What do you want start with the hair

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Actually my only real request

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Would be that I find out where you buy her clothes

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Because like the big thing

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
With cosplaying right now is buying the same things

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
That they have on the show

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
This is actually the same sweater

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
She wore in this episode

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Well we can

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
We'll figure that out

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I'm sure wardrobe would love to honestly

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Like they

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Literally just nice dress

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Nice cardigan not too low cut

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
She's not a whore

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
She wore a back brace

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Annie be specific

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Give us a color so that when you watch that episode

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
You know that you actually have the same

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I think it should definitely be yahoo purple

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
A yahoo purple

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
You know maybe a little honda blue

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Like something

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Like yellow

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Like a purple cardigan

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Purple cardigan

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Floral dress

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
And flats

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Flats and tights obviously

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
If so desired

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
I mean might as well

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
I don't want to step on anyone's toes creatively

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Yeah I mean I wouldn't I'm not going to stand in the way of

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
I think

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Alright

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
So you'll see the finale

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
This is like a dream coming true

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
You have to remember that

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
You have to remember that

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Chris has to remember that

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
I don't have to do anything

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I'll talk to you guys

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
I'll remind you

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
So we're all watching the finale of that season

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
And we see Annie in purple and yellow

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
It's because Annie here

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Yes because a real Annie

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Who gave everything

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Yes

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Alright well let's have a hand for Annie

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Thank you

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Thank you very much

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
You're so sweet thank you

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
I hope to God

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
That when something bad starts happening to me

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I can start to become

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
A good person miraculously

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
What about Rebar

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
I don't know she knows about that

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
We didn't want to like corner her about Rebar

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
At that moment

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Aaron is here

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
My wife

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
My wife

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Look at this dress

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
You're like a creamsicle

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
You look like a creep

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Like a creeper

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Minecraft

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
How does she look

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
A creamsicle

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Aren't creamsicles orange

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Are creamsicles green

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Creamsicles are green

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Sometimes

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Really?

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
No they're orange

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I got a little distracted

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
How is everybody doing

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Wait now stop it

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Creamsicles are any color they need to be

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
But they're defined by having cream

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
In the middle of them

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
I disagree I think creamsicles are orange

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
With cream in the middle

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Are all creamsicles orange

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
That's a very tepid response

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
There's some cherry ones

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
But there's not any lime creamsicles

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Originally it was an orange and white affair

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
But I think they might have added other flavors down the road

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
But not green though

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I've never seen a green creamsicle

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
That's what I'm saying

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
They're orange

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Alright this guy

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Yeah high five

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I came here in a petty cab

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Oh yeah?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Because I couldn't get a ride out

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
This guy's got a green creamsicle motherfucker

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Oh shit

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
But this looks like a kind of

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I don't know that looks like some black market shit

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I came here in a petty cab

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Because I couldn't get a ride

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
And the petty cab had to go

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Across the bat bridge

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
While people were gathering to watch the bats

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
And it was a nightmare

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Because I felt like I was doing some

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Weird performance art because I was wearing this dress

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
They're waiting for the bats but you're the only thing

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
That they're getting

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
And then I heard

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Oh princess

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Princess coming through

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
And I got so bad that I started

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Kind of like holding my leg

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
To imply that maybe

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Yeah that I was hurt

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Oh but I wouldn't give for a collapsing spine

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
I'm kidding she liked it

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
She got it

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
By the way a lot of Annie's clothes are from H&M

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Yes and Forever 21

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
And recently and more recently

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
J Crew

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
But you don't like that stuff

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
The recent stuff

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
It's my fault

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I'm sorry

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Oh man

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
So you guys are all employees at Yahoo?

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Cool

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
I heard resounding yeses

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
I know you're not I'm just kidding

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
If you want

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Can we talk just about

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
How hard it is to be married to me

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
While I'm working on the show

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
So that Chris can feel better

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Tell me about it

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
We're kind of both married to Dan

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Chris is on his second kid

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Work wife

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Our pilot

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
I mean it's like

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
It's a big theme of this year

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Between me and Chris who are just

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Running the show without any kind of

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
We're not like oh then there's

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
That other guy that helps us and so

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
We're just kind of like not home at all

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
And

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I just wanted to uncork that entertainment

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Fountain

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I assume it's the same as

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Being married to like a sailor

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Who's off at sea

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
It's very similar

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
When you watch the show

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Are you gonna be like

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
No but I'm saying when you watch it

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
It doesn't premiere until March 17th

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
On Yahoo

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
When you watch it

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I'm really

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
There's a syndrome that happens where

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I haven't been home in three days

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
And then I can either come home for the fourth day

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Or I can stay and try to make the show

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Worth not having been home for three days

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Because I keep picturing you watching the show

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
And going

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
That's exactly what goes through my mind

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
All the time

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
When I miss my children's birthdays

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
I go like

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
I'm like oh if she laughs a lot

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Then she'll forget

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Right?

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Or when your son Charlie is in a flop house

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
And someone's like community's on

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
He's like yeah it's real good isn't it

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
It's worth it isn't it

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
As he's trying to hide his swastika tattoo

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Oh look they're doing a karate

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Kid joke

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Great while he's getting

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
A big bang theory tattoo on his ass

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Or something

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Yeah Charlie McKenna

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Is going to be like the biggest big

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Bang theory fan in the world

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I doubt I'll watch it

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
I was the biggest fan of World War II Japanese

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I doubt I'll watch it

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
With a creative eye

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I'm sure I'll just be very supportive

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
But I will say that a couple days ago

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
My dad and I were talking

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Like it was after like a string

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Of you not being home for four or five days

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
And Chris I don't want to like

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Belittle you not seeing your kids

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
But we have two dogs

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
And

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
That's more difficult than children

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I know thank you

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I'm just kidding

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Every time I feel sad that Dan's not there

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
To see the dogs grow up I'm like oh no

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
They're human beings

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I actually do like I'm not doing it to be

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Like I

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
For exactly the reason like sometimes Aaron

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Will send me the hostage pictures of the dog

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Like the dogs are being cute

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
And I will just like copy and paste

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
A video of your kid

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I put it back but I am just

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
It does make me feel better

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
His first time on the potty and stuff

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Because dogs never learn to talk

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
It's harder

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Like your kids really slowly becoming

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Something that can take care of himself

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
What would you do if one of our dogs

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Did manage to talk

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
And you weren't there for it

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Big deal

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I'd be sad

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Really quick I was talking to my dad

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
The other day and my dad's like

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
My dad is obsessed with Dan

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
When is community premiering

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
And this is after like five days

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Of you not being home and I'm like

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Can you just not talk about her right now

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I said her

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
She referred to the show as her

54:06.000 --> 54:12.000
You guys are checked out

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
It is very loud

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Oh you guys

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Can't hear

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
There's mingling

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Happening at the bottom

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
The speakers are not pointed towards

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
The frontist of Rose is probably the problem

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I'm up here just now

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I was having a great time

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I didn't know you couldn't hear me

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I was like patting myself on the back

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
For ignoring the sound

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I'm such a good performer

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Because I'm supposed to care about that

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
But they can't hear that

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
And then they're

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
But

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
I'm very very excited

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
About community and it's going to be

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
It's going to be great

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Do you guys see that Jeff has walked off

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Stage and is now

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Grumble grumble grumble

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
I got a treatment for respect of a pilot

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Of a thing

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
I got a new app

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
It's called creepy stone guy on stage

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
I come into your podcast

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Who was it

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
At South by Southwest

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
That said to another person at South by Southwest

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Will you please meet me

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
To talk business

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
At the Harmontown show

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Here's where it is

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Here's what time it starts

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Dan it's Jeff Davis

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I'm reporting live from the back of the bar

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
You can't hear shit back here

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
It's very noisy back here Dan

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Hey Jeff what's going on

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
There's a lot of people going grumble grumble

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Mumble grumbles

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
How you doing back here what's your name miss

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
You are here right

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
What's your name

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Stephanie how old are you Stephanie

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I'm not handsome

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
I'm sorry I came on too hard

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
You guys have no booze back here it's just beer and wine

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
That's terrible

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
We got to get more of that top shelf booze

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
And get everybody fucked up

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Right now

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Drinks are on Stephanie

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Free one round on Stephanie everybody

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
A round of beer and wine

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
It's an open bar

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
It's an open bar

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Yeah I think that's the problem

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Mumbling riffraff

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Mumbling in

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
It's not going to last long

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
You push down on it like a cyst

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
And it drains

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
It fills back up

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
They're having their cake and eating it too

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
They're listening to the podcast kind of

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
I don't mention it because

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I thought I would be being selfish

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
By mentioning it because I thought only

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
From my last experience I thought

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
It's something I can hear but they can't hear

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I could talk about this all day

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
So anyways

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Community is going to be

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Bad

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
And it's okay because I love you

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
No

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
It's going to be great

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Dan how are you going to make it up here

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
When the community is done being written

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
What are you going to do to make it up all the time

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
You've missed together

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Well now that I'm dressing Annie for Annie

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I think I kind of like

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Can I make a request?

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Can you come home for dinner once a year?

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Is that okay?

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
The finale of Community

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Can you hug me?

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Hi

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Purple cardigan and a yellow floral dress

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
It's very

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Thank you

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
What is your name and do you have a job that keeps you

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Away

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Oh wait

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Oh hi Jeremy

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Sorry

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
I'm just giggling because he was answering

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Ernestly

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Yeah

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Yeah

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
It's great

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
He's doing great

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I can't imagine a world where I watch

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Community looking for some reason

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Why that's not, that's silly

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
It's going to be great

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
I mean it's my favorite show

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I love how it's about

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Just like friends playing pranks

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
And there's the Asian guy

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
That's a ghost

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
And there's

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
The personality

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
It's sometimes a black woman

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
And sometimes a blonde woman

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
And it's just fascinating

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
It's like no exit

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
You're John Paul Sartre

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
I tell her stuff about the show

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
That you guys don't know

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
The whole thing is taking place

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
In a bag of

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Purell

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
That at the end of it

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Wipes his hands with it and goes

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Ew

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
How do you feel about Purell

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Everybody on stage

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
I feel like it doesn't belong in bags

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Yeah

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
I don't believe in germs

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I don't like germophobia

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I think it's silly

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
You don't believe in germs

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
I don't believe in making room

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
For them in society

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
I think that human beings are

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Primates

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
We've been here a really long time

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
We were born into a world of germs

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
And when we disinfect

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Each other and ourselves

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Compulsively

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
We're just moving sand around

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
A beach and making a problem

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
It's just very interesting coming from the man

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Who will only drink bottled water

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
He gave me the same speech when my five month old

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Had the croop

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
I heard she had the croop

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
I wasn't there

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
That's not the same as being scared of germs

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
It's insane

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
We're all constantly

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
When you go into the bathroom

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
I bet this doesn't happen in the women's room

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
But in the men's room

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
There's always a

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Ragged, grody

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Threaded hand towel

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Threaded through the door

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Handle

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
By some jackass

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Who thought he was the most important person

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
In the world and that you were a piece of filth

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
So he's not going to touch the bathroom door

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I don't understand what you mean

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
The bathroom that when you leave the men's room

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
A stall door?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
No, the bathroom door

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
So there's like this

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
He doesn't care about his fucking gross napkin

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Hanging

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And being on the floor

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
The bathroom's a shit-sty because people who are afraid of germs

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
They license themselves to make everything

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Disgusting and filthy

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
There's like a crap and piss everywhere

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Because everyone's not sitting on the toilet seat

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And spraying their gross poop everywhere

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
So you put your fucking ass on the piece of plastic

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
That you share with the person next to you

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
They're not a monster

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
You are a germ!

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
You're made of germs

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
You're a blob of flesh

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
And blood

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
You crawl out of the ocean, you carry it with you

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
You're festooned with mites

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And lice and fucking micro bugs

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And grow up

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And get over yourself

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
And share with others

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I don't mind germophobia

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Unless it's somebody's identity

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Or personality

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
When they make it a thing

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Yeah, no one wants to hang out with someone

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Who's defined by their fear of anything

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I do have a problem though

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I just spend a lot of time in bars

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And guys don't wash their hands

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
But the same guys, they see you

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
They're just determined to shake your hand

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I just saw you grab your dick and not wash your hands

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I don't want to shake your fucking hand

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
That's gross

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
I'll touch your dick, fine

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
If you want him to touch your dick

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
He'll absolutely, well he's coming up

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
To make you touch his dick

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Meet you Annie, we're going to dry hump

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
We're going to touch your dick, it's going to be great

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
There's a human being here

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Should you come up here just to

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Because you probably

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So Dan, talk about

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
The creation of the human being

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I was in there for it

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I was always obsessed

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
With the idea of race, believe it or not

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And the idea of

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Racism being

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Something that people want to avoid

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And then the idea of avoiding racism

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Slowly becoming the most racist

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Activity you could ever engage in

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Because you have to start actually

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Talking about race as if it's like this palette

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Of paint

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
People are like, we have to

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I don't know, I was just always fascinated with it

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Oh no, oh nice

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Oh, he can't talk

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
6,000

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Fan points

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Refusal to speak

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Genuinely, genuinely afraid

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Well it's supposed to, that's the neat thing

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Isn't it? Yeah, no it is

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It's a neat thing, but it's effective

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It is really scary

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
For those of you here tonight

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Who haven't seen the show

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
It's a really funny joke

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
That I wrote once

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
It's funny

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
It'd be funny if all these people

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Talking were guerrilla marketers

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
For our community

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
They're all going like, you gotta check out the show

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
There's a good show, you know the show he's talking about

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I don't know, I don't know

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Gile soap, Gile soap, Gile soap

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Who's that guy? Get him!

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
My question about the people

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
That are here at this bar

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Is this their favorite bar

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
This is their cheers

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Open bar is their favorite bar

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Oh yeah

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
They found an open bar and they're not leaving

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I'm gonna go down to the pub love

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I'll be back after a pint

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Be careful you know

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
They're doing a podcast down there tonight

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Oh love

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
You know how you get when you go down to the pub

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
There's a podcast going on

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
You're in the back

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
It's fine, we can all live together

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I just want me pint

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Don't forget your lanyard

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Yay!

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Oh yes

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Forgot me lanyard

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Oh a bit of the same Miguel

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Oh Andy are you doing tonight my friend

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Oh good Miguel

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I'm the Spanish Scottish guy

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Oh what's all this then

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Oh they're doing a podcast

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
As they tend to do

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I'm the Spanish

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
When will it end

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Well I missed it

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
You could just be a publican and have a bar

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And the people could come in and have a drink

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And there wouldn't be any podcast going on

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
You know sorry

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Sorry to cut off your improv there

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I feel like this guy probably doesn't watch community

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Do you watch community

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
What was your favorite character

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Not allowed to say this is a different guy than before

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I'm not saying this was the same guy

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I'm saying this is a guy who doesn't watch community

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
This is the podcast

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
This is an insane turn

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Time out

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Okay so I'll speak for the human being

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
He's saying time out so are you a fan of community

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I don't

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
We gotta let him whisper to you

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
No you can whisper to me

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I just feel like this would be

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Okay

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
The easiest way to murder us

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
The human being's favorite character

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Is Abed

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Not a real character

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
You're just making that up

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Human being can I translate

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Your physical movement

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Spencer do you have a question for a human being

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Yeah

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Look towards me I'm your translator

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
But don't look right at me

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
This is how I die

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I mean he's not carrying any weapons

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
We'd be able to tell

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
This is the podcast

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Human being

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Why is Abed your favorite character

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Can you explain through movement to me

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Well where do I begin

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Let's see

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
How do I make this make sense

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Through a lot of time

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And squares

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Back in the beginning of

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Oh angry everybody else understands

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Talking

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Talking about the past

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And about our stories

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Our personal let's go back a little bit

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Erin you dumb bitch

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Fuck you Erin

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I'm out

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
No I'm back

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Talking

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
About

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
TV

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I like how he talks about TV

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
And he uses TV to

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Reflect human interactions

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And it makes me feel more

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
You're going to die at midnight

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
That's what he does

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
That's what he does

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Let's have a hand for the human being number

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Thank you

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Thank you sir

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Madam the human being

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Human being

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Do you think there's something to the idea

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Of

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
That box that he was miming

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
The television Abed's

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Proclivity for or propensity or need

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
To study humanity

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Through that lens

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
The idea of separation

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
The idea of nylon fetishry

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
The idea of

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
The body being like encased

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
In like

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
A kind of coating of safe material

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
I don't know

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Yes

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Tactile like squeeze machines

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Temple Grandin

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
What's a squeeze machine

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Temple Grandin

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
You haven't seen the Temple Grandin HBO movie

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
What's Temple Grandin

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Oh bro

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
It's the best bar in Austin

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
It is amazing

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
You haven't been to Temple Grandin on Rainy Street

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
You don't have to talk to anybody

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
You just go in and you get wrapped in gauze

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
And people pour drinks on you

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Temple Grandin is a

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
When you first go in there they tell you

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
You can't have a drink because the drink you're ordering

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Has never been heard of before

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
But then people start to believe in you

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Because your brain just thinks different

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Temple Grandin changed the way that we treat

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Animals and slaughterhouses and did a lot

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Wait

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Didn't Upton Sinclair do that

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Well in a way

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
He just pointed it out and then he was like goodbye

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Upton Sinclair was about protecting

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
People from the health

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Issues

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Right

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Temple Grandin actually was saying

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
We are being enormously cruel to these

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Animals

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
And it's costing us money

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
It's a good thing we fixed all those problems

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
She's a savant and an amazing

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Genius who has done a lot

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Those balloons in the back are really cool

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
They're like dip and dots

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Upton Sinclair

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Kind of like the purell of the meatpacking

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Industry

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Yeah he was afraid of germs

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Some germs are bad

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
When you're eating

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
You came up pretty hard

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
On germ people

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I just mean the everyday

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
If you're out and about

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And you die of a germ

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I'll give you a million dollars

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Does that include everything?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Like if you

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Go in the bathroom right now with a q-tip

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Rub the q-tip on any toilet seat

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
And put it in a petri dish

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
And see what grows

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Then take the same q-tip

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Well not the same one

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Take a different q-tip, rub it on your armpit

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Rub that in a petri dish

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And does it know about Ebola or

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I know about Ebola, it doesn't fucking

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
It's not gonna be in a toilet seat

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
These things that kill you

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
They live inside liquid

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
That's why in those sci-fi movies

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
About everyone dying

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
They have to go airborne

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
That's a big thing

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Alright whatever you guys

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Everyone be afraid, see where it gets you

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Remember Super Volcano

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Remember that week

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
There's a Super Volcano under Yellowstone

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Who gives a shit?

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
What are you gonna die happy?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
As somebody who shares a bed with you

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Can I request that you

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Don't lick anything out of a toilet seat

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Or that you take a little bit of care

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Even if you don't believe in it

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
By the way

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Dan and I share a couch

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I don't know what you're talking about

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Also you got dressed together this morning

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
You look great

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
You look good

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Do we play Shadowrun

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
In a weird

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Echoey barn?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
We're gonna have to play a high energy Shadowrun

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
To match the room tone

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I'm up in the air about this

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
As a producer of a podcast

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
At the very least

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
We should hold off a bit

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Maybe get some raps out of the way

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
And then do

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
A big burst

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Of role playing

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
That's really high energy

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Alright seriously

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I'm gonna do the best fucking rap

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
It's not a joke

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I'm gonna rap

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
It's gonna be the best rap

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Everyone's gonna freak out

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
But I can't think about it

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
It's gonna be so good

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
You're gonna be like he didn't think about it

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Just empty your head

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
And don't

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Dan?

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
A suggestion Dan

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
No don't make a suggestion

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Not a lyrical suggestion

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
A physical suggestion

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Like last time when you were rapping out in the street

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Maybe test how far the limits of this microphone

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Do we know how far the signal

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
How far does that receiver go

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Just to the back of the seats

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
We have someone that knows that kind of thing

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
We'll see

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
We'll see

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Are you ready Dan?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Yo Yo Yo Yo Yo Yo Yo

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I got the flow in the science

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Yo Yo Yo Yo Yo

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Get ready for the best rap Dan Harmon has ever done

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
2015 South by Southwest

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Austin Texas

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Storm clouds

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Lightning rain

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I fucked your mama till I felt the pain

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I walked streets

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I saw your dad

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I said fuck your mama and it wasn't bad

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
He said you and I

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
We should be friends

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
We could be friends until the end

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Because we both fucked your mama and she's my wife

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So now I fucked your mama all my life

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
And we we're both married to your mom

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I'm talking about major Tom level sci-fi

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Blast it off into the space

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
So fuck your mama in her eye and everything on her face

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
That sounded gross

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I'm so sorry

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Yo Yo

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
My name is Kevin Johnson

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I am a different character

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
What the fuck

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Get the fuck out of here

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Yo

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I'm Kevin Johnson

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
What?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Strange development

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
My name is Kevin Johnson and I'm here to say

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Every rap that I do is in a Kevin way

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I go hip to the hop to the Kevin to the tip

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I fucked your mama from her nose to her lip

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Kevin Johnson

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Not much different, just lower octave

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Get out of here

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Austin style

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Texas

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Sand

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Cactus

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Big land

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Houston

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Can suck my dick

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Yeah

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Don't have to rhyme when they applaud

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Houston can suck my dick

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Dallas

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Fuck you

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
You're just a TV show

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I fucked your mama so hard

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
She enjoyed it

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
We're dating now

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
We're committed

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I truly love her

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I'm committed to her

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
It's called beyond sexuality

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I don't even care anymore

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I consider your mama a fucking partner in my life

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
If she got sick, I would never leave

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Fuck your mama so hard

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
I would never leave her

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
She's my partner

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Sometimes she goes to the bathroom at an airport

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
And I look at her photo

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I miss her so much

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I fucking love your mama

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.000
I would spend my life fucking here

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Dan Harmon, everybody

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Thank you

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I'm not going to look back at the standing O

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I don't even know

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Oh, shit

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
They sat quickly

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
That was great

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Yeah

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
That was great

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
I've graduated physically to a new thing

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Where I don't bother to try to...

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Did you ever notice that?

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I used to go like that

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
But now I'm just slowly going like this

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I am a toddler, I know

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I recognize it

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
As you get older

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
You start to treat your ledges like big stairs

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Because it's the way to preserve your dignity

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Because if I were to go into committing to it being a thing

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Then I would go like this

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And then I'd be like, I can't

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I'm just going to do it Louis Anderson style now

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000
It's only at that moment that you chose to preserve your dignity for us

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Yeah, thank you

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
These things go on in your head

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
They don't reflect reality

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Pretty nice set

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Dan, do you want to do some stand-up set riffing?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Do you want to riff the set for us?

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I want to take advantage of the set with a good musical cue

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Aaron, clear their sight lines

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Here we go

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Do you want to rap me or what do you want to do?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Something dramatic and sci-fi

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Sci-fi? Alright

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:43.000
From the beginning of the Quantum Cosmos

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Entertainment has subsisted on one wavelength alone

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:57.000
The division between entertainer and the entertained

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Now that barrier is shattered with a new show

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
One reaching into your mind

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Making you part of the wonderment

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
That's not really going anywhere

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Alright

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.000
You are losing your craving for cigarettes

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
You are thinking about stepping outside for a smoke

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
This device has no power over you

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
You are a sexual assertive being

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Your board meeting is going to go well

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Whether or not you eat the bagel

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
You can be thin

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
You can be decisive

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
You can run a company

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
You just aren't yet

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Don't smoke

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Stop eating

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Skip the ranch

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Seize the day

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I thought that was building

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Futuristic weight loss anti-smoking guy

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
You're right, you're right, you're right

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
That was entertainment

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I think four people actually went out to get a smoke during that

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I made them think about it

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I thought about it

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I quit smoking when I was 32

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Remember smoking? Who smokes here?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Yay

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Oh, yeah

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Oh, yeah, we took a photo together earlier in the day

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I don't even...

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I think it was in your other hand

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
He's just trying to play to the crowd

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
No, you're cool, man, he's cool

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Everyone give him stuff

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
What's the thing you can do with this many people that you can't do?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Play Duck Duck Goose

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Some people want to play Duck Duck Goose

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
It's the worst game ever made

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
I want to see if you could crowd surf all the way down one row

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
and then all the way back up the other side

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
No, we can't crowd surf

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Not with that attitude, you can't

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
You could conduct an orchestra you could assign

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
You could do that summer camp thing

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
That's what I was thinking

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
You guys are really into Snickers

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
but you guys are really into Doritos

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
I don't know

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Not unless they pay us

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
We got to figure out an ending point

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.000
so we can move on with our celebration of community

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
We're moments away from playing Shadowrun

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I know, but...

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
We have to just commit to making it a really high energy chapter of Shadowrun

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Last time I think we just got in the car and went to a thing

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
We didn't do shit

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I mean, you did... I don't know

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Let's not dwell on the past

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
It's true

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
So this is like an action set piece for playing Shadowrun

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
because we just pulled away from the...

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Well, I don't want to tell Spencer his business

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Yeah, what are we talking about?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:31.000
This is a lot of competition from the infusion bar

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Why don't you guys sell drinks?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I just don't think the shushing helps

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
I appreciate the sentiment

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
It just doesn't seem effective is the only thing

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
What's your name?

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Jessica has volunteered to go over to the bar and yell at people

01:20:46.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Let's hear it for Jessica, everybody

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Jessica is circling around the back

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I don't want to be a defeatist

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
but I want to point out that this is why our show had low ratings

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
just because you're always hearing from the person that's telling you

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
to take it more seriously

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
You know, and then like Parks and Rec

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
you can just hang out and talk and watch it

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Hey, I'd like a drink and I love Parks and Rec

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
and then it's like, no, shut up, listen

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Fuck you

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Flip

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
All right

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Jessica, don't give up yet, you're doing good

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
You've done good

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Jessica

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Get over there, Jessica, make some enemies

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Make people upset with you

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
She's got help, we have another woman coming to help her

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Why don't we all go to the bar and do the show over there

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Why don't we all take everybody over to the bar

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
and we'll just all go to the bar

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I would think that they would come over here and talk

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And he goes up like, guys, do you mind, really?

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I think that

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
My spine and my enthusiasm is collapsing right now

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I think the thing to do would be the opposite of telling them not to talk

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
The thing to do would probably go down there and

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
tell them to talk

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Okay

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Welcome to Secrets and Lies

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Featuring the people in the bar

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Hi gentlemen, hey, are you guys talking about apps?

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
We are

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
You are? What kind of apps do you have?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Well, we're about to Instagram a picture of all you all on the stage

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Great, great, keep it down, hi, hi, how you doing?

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
You look like you're in a rock band

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Are you in a rock band?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Yeah, actually I am

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
What's the name of your band?

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Yeah, the funk master

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Cool, keep it down

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000
How are you guys? I think that covers it

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Wait, where's the rumbling?

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
There's a rumbling back here

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Hey, hey, hey, where are your kids?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
I don't have kids

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Well, exactly

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I don't know, keep it down

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
You guys are doing great, you're beautiful, beautiful

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
I don't know, I don't know if that worked

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
But you at any time could be on the show for a time

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
All right, all right

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I mean, I think it works, but it's going to, it's going to, the half life of that

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
What was the way that you got up?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Yeah, yeah

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Well, I have to fill that chunk

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Oh dear, oh no, oh baby

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Oh no, oh

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
And I can't bend down to help her

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Dry hump, dry hump opportunity

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Oh, I'm out, thank you

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
All right

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Good job, baby

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
All right

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
We've cleared, we've cleared

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Now that we've gotten that kind of silence

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Let's earn it with our 9-Eleven song

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I think I just made it worse

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Maybe I was a little me and another

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Like what the fuck was that?

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
If you're talking during this, then you're glad 9-Eleven happened

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
It's okay, it's okay, they're having a good time

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Because I'm singing a 9-Eleven song

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
I'm just saying

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Don't come down

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Stay up

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Stay towers

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Why can't it be

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000
9-10 again?

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Why did it ever be 9-Eleven?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Freedom, speech,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
terrors, reach

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Pakistan must be behind this

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Foreign strife

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Liberated life

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I'm calling to you

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000
But I can't hear your name

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Oh 9-Eleven

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Why can't you be 9-10 again?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000
9-Eleven

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:08.000
When will you be 9-Eleven 12?

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:17.000
When will I stop breathing?

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Freedom, I saw your body in the sunlight

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:32.000
I saw you, but you couldn't reach my hand

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Dan, is this going to go on for a long time?

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Because I don't want to be on stage for this

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Do not like this

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Evil, get back in the zone

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Yes

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Space, space, space

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Space, rocket, 9-Eleven

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Vaccinations, leukemia, cancer

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.000
AIDS, 9-Eleven

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Don't talk during this

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Send a message to your children

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000
What will we leave behind

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:38.000
If we talk during the 9-Eleven segment of a show?

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Where will we change?

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Where will we grow?

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I want to touch God's body

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:53.000
I want to be Trent Reznor

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I want to touch your body

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I want a 9-Eleven

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:11.000
What if we're all animals inside?

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:17.000
What if fucking and Jesus open wide?

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Offensive things are good

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Offensive things are art

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I want a 9-Eleven

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I want a 9-Your Heart

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
9-Eleven

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Vaccines

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Autism

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000
9-Eleven

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Autism

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000
9-Eleven

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:06.000
All right, should we do like a...

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Thanks guys

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Thank you

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I loved it

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000
You wouldn't have thought so hard to prove me wrong if I hadn't said anything

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000
That is a 37% standing ovation

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:28.000
That's the 37% that's going to keep us on the air, buddy

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000
That's the 30% of our audience that can hear what we're doing up here

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000
This is like pockets of weird acoustics

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I would have preferred if everyone had stood up just 37%

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Can you guys do that right now?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Standing Prout

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
There we go

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
That was easily 60 plus percent

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Did you say, Dan, at one point that you want to touch God's pony?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
His body

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
What did you think I said?

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I thought you said you want to touch God's pony

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
That's cute

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
How do you 9 someone's 11?

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
I know that you want a 9-My-Eleven

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Physically, what is the procedure?

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And now the suits come out and they want their explanations

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And they want their affidavits, but it's fucking art

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:28.000
You don't explain it, you spit it, and you move on, or else people die

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I don't know what it means, grandpa

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I'm just saying, before I signed up for having my 11-9, I want to know exactly what I'm signing up for

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
You'll know

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
You'll know what's going to happen tonight

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Can you 11-9? Could you go backwards and reverse engineer?

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Yes, I'm going to 11-9 tonight

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000
That's how they say it, that's how that song was released in Europe

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Because they just get confused because it's not that

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Because they would call September 11th, 11-9

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Oh, that's right, they would have

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.000
No one's ever talked about that

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
They must be so confused

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:13.000
On November 9th, they seem to be just hanging out

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Apparently not that big a deal to them

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Wait, on 9-11, is there visual celebrations that Europeans would see?

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Yeah, you know, like...

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Everyone's like, yeah, towers fall again

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I thought it was great

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Now, is that you doing Trent Rissner or Jim Morrison? It was kind of somewhere in between

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
But it came through me and it was fucking amazing

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:45.000
You got... Have we ever had standing ovations during a show before?

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I don't know that we have

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:52.000
No, unless you count the Oscars that I won an Emmy for

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
That got a standing ovation

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:00.000
That wasn't really me performing, that was Hugh Jackman doing when I wrote

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:07.000
But Sean Penn stood up and he doesn't even like the country, so it's like, kind of found his joy

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Alright, I say Spencer, let's play some badass high-action shadow

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Oh, you have a question, sir?

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
What's up?

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I'm sorry about you, you brought Sean Penn

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000
You brought Sean Penn, and I'm Mexican, so I really want to know what you thought of what he said during the Oscars

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And furthermore, I would like to know what you think about drug dealing in Mexico

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:34.000
This guy's Mexican and he wanted to know...

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.000
What did Sean Penn say? Are you talking about like the...

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.000
He said that he made the joke about the guy who doesn't have a green card or something like that

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000
He was just joking, right? He was just... I think they were just pals, yeah

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Do you want to come up here and talk about it?

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Because you can

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Mexican-Harmenian!

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.000
You didn't even do the knee crawl, he just stood right up

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.000
So you were just... I didn't see that part of the Oscars

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
So Sean Penn made a joke and was it offensive to...

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
You didn't see the last award, the best movie award?

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
I wasn't up for anything

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Fair enough, fair enough

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Sean Penn made it... Did you just make an offhand joke or was he being political?

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Well, I think it was an offhand joke, but there was so much debate on Twitter that he was super racist and whatever

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
He was just like, who gave this guy a green card?

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.000
It sounded like to me that he... I think he even knows the guy and he was making a joke about how hard we are on immigration

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I think I didn't even have a green card

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I think he was making... he was being ironic, right?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
He was doing a bit, like he was doing his impression of a conservative

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
I remember when we forgave him for beating the shit out of Madonna

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
What's that?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Penn beat the shit out of Madonna

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I'm not sure about that, but...

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
What was your name? Sorry, I don't get your name

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Eric

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
We've met three times

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Where's your green card?

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Actually, last time I asked you about your advice on me trying to get a green card so I could stay here and work

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:11.000
You said, you know, sometimes you'll just have to admit that maybe you'll die under a bridge, but you'll die doing what you love

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
That's what you said to me

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Yes

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Yeah

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
That's true

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I think you kind of...

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Eric, thank you so much, sir

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Alright, Eric, Eric, Eric the Mexican, is that politically incorrect too?

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
It's a nationality

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Mucho gusto, señor

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Síntate

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Alright, Spencer

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Do we have our character sheets?

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Oh, I got them

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Or should we just freestyle without us? Should we just go from the hip?

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.000
No, no, we'll do it by the books

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:53.000
What I meant was you got to imagine yourself dying under a bridge doing what you love and if that's okay with you then you should keep doing what you're doing

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Dan, have you ever had fantasies about being in a band or fronting a band?

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
About me in a band?

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Yes, have you ever had a fantasy about being in a band?

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Sorry

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:15.000
What the bar don't know is that they're really going to be missing out on four people playing a role-playing game

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
It's entertainment dynamites

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
We're going to make it amazing though

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
It's a jungle over there

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Alright, Spencer, are you good to go on this?

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Sure, yeah

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Alright, so I guess Chris is going to be playing Dr. Friend, I imagine?

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Yeah, Chris is playing Dr. Friend

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Alright, you guys ready for some fucking hard ass...

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Take no prisoners

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Futuristic RPG bullshit, Austin, Texas style

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Alright

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Spencer, if you would, would you please get us up to speed?

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Yup

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
It's just bursting through

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Today's Harmontown Recap was brought to you by Twitter user Let'sBeSapin

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Last time on Harmontown Shadowrun

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Our heroes continued their quest to capture Baldwin Brown as they drove their truck full of BTL chips to a small wooden house

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Led by Eve's Spirit Eagle

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Upon arrival, Eve's attempt to astrally project into the house was thwarted by a strong mana barrier

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:27.000
The fearless gym nightblade, the charming Mercy O'Donnell, and foreign hordegaard took matters into their own hands

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:33.000
The threesome infiltrated the rickety old house only to be met with a rickety old woman

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Hordegaard distracted the woman as Mercy and Nightblade entered the basement to find two sleeping figures

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Meanwhile, back at the truck, Eve and Dr. Friend explored their feelings for each other and shared a tender kiss while the Johnson sat by awkwardly

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Will our gang find Baldwin Brown?

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Will Hordegaard enjoy coffee with the old woman?

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000
What will happen to Eve and Dr. Friend's budding relationship?

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Find out on Harmon Run Shadow Town

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Alright

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:16.000
So again, just to give credit where credit's due, a guy on Twitter named Let'sMeSapin wrote that for me

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000
So I didn't write it

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000
So that's a new thing, if you can write a Shadowrun recap

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Yeah, if you want to write a Shadowrun recap and it's good, I'll read it because it's extra work that I won't have to do

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
That's great, that's awesome

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Fantastic

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Alright, so who's in the house right now?

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
So right now we have Gym Nightblade and Mercy in the house as well as Hordegaard who doesn't exist

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:49.000
So Gym Nightblade and Mercy O'Donnell are downstairs in the basement, they're peering into a darkened room where two sleeping figures appear to be sleeping

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Meanwhile Eve and Friend are in the truck outside of the house

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Who am I with?

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
You're with Jeff Davis, Eve

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I get on the com link and I say Mercy, Nightblade, what's going on in the house? Give me the situation

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Alright, we got two dozers underground

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000
We haven't discussed what to do yet but I think we should calmly arouse them

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000
I'm gonna take a closer look at them

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Okay

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:28.000
You take a closer look at them, they don't seem to be moving, you just see, it looks kind of like just these still figures next to each other in bed

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Almost like a rose of dirt

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Okay, I blow really hard in their faces

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Okay

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
They wake up with a start

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Huh, what? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Can you start screaming? They're screaming

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
I stun baton

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Alright, what's your club's plus agility?

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
God damn it

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
What do they look like Spencer?

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000
They look like an old balding man and a young goatee wearing boy

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
I mean not boy, teenager

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
I don't know

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Say again, a teenager with a what?

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
20 year old guy with a goatee and a balding man

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000
You want, it's fucking balding, god damn it, what?

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Do they look healthy? Clubs 3, unarmed 3, is that what you want?

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
No, agility is the other one

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Agility 5

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000
You hit him, right in the thing

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:31.000
But he doesn't seem to be bothered by it, he's just sleepy, he's getting stunned, he's like, oh my god, Jesus Christ

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Is it Baldwin Brown?

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Yeah

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Gentlemen, okay, I'm gonna use, I'm gonna use Con

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Okay

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Gentlemen, we've been sent here by Brian McMahon, what's his name?

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
What?

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Baldwin Brown

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000
We've been sent here by Baldwin Brown, but we can't find him, can you tell us where he is?

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
That's me, and you're never gonna catch me alive

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Drone, attack, attack, drone, attack

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Okay, so is the young guy a drone?

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
What?

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
The old man's a drone

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
No

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Who is talking?

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000
The old man

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
The old man

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Baldwin Brown is the guy you're talking to

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Yeah, I just realized, did we all know that?

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Don't cover the mic with your hands

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Did we all know that?

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
No, we found out

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:30.000
You see a metallic sphere float up into the air, it must be this drone, it turns a turret towards you mercy, and it fires several bullets

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Uh oh

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Oh, but you dodge, you dodge nimbly out of the way of the drone

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I run out of the room

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Okay, you run out of the room

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Right

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Leaving Nightblade alone

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Can I shoot it?

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
The drone?

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Yeah

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Yeah

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
What's your pistols plus agility?

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Pistols is two plus two, agility is five

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Alright

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000
You hit the drone, and you pierce its, what do you call it?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Armor shell, the bullet, you hear it reflecting inside the armor shell of the machine, and the drone falls to the ground with a crash, it must have been pretty cheap

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Yeah

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Can I just like, like I just want to restrain this guy immediately

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Okay, Baldwin

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Okay, you start grappling with Baldwin Brown, and you go to the floor, you're rolling around each other, and the goatee wearing guys are like

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Alright you motherfuckers, knock this off right now, or I'm gassing this whole place

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000
No fighting, no fighting in here, no fighting, no fighting

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Bitch

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
If I stop fighting, are you gonna drone me?

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:55.000
No, you killed the drone bitch

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Okay, can I run back in and use my wireless knife on the kid?

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Uh, do you just want to like stab him with it?

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Yeah

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Uh, yeah, what's your knives, or what's your blades plus agility?

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Um, so it's, so the wireless knife thing is 3P5

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
No, your blade skill, it's a skill

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Oh blade skills, right

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Yeah

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Uh, 4, and my agility is 6

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Okay, you stab at him with the knife, but with an inhuman cyborg like reflex, he dril- he jumps to the side faster than your eyes can see

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.000
And he disarms the blade, now he's holding the knife

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Alright everybody

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I got the knife bitch

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Stop it, everybody cool it, cool it

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000
I'm getting off of Baldwin Brown, and I'm like, I'm raising my hands

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Meanwhile, in the truck, guy, uh, doctor, we should get in there, it sounds like they're having trouble in there

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
You sure you don't need some healing?

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000
You don't need any healing?

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Um, yeah, yeah, you could heal me a bit, I could take a bit of quick healing

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Can I heal Eve a little?

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Yeah, Eve is healed for a bit of damage

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I healed you

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Okay, you know, doc, you're no fighter, we need you alive, stay in the truck, guard the BTL chips, I'm going in

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Perfect

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I run toward the house

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Alright, you enter the house, you see an old lady sitting on the couch in the front room enjoying a coffee with a dwarf, oh hordegaard

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000
I have some, I taste some of the coffee

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Alright

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
I go downstairs in the basement

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Okay, you see what's happening, you see Baldwin Brown and Dan kind of, or not Dan, sorry, sorry Dan

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Jim Nightblade staring at each other like something's gonna go down and you see a young man with goatee holding a knife as if he's gonna attack people with it

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Hey guys, this is Baldwin Brown, let's get this motherfucker and get the fuck out of here

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Alright, hold it, hold it, hold it

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Okay, can I use negotiation?

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Yeah, what are you trying to negotiate?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Uh, a sit down

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Okay

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Say words to that effect

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Alright

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, come on, we're all

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.000
We're all doing the same thing here, let's just calm down, put down the knife

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
And let's talk for a second, alright?

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I'm gonna calm down, but I'm not gonna put down the knife, I feel like you just

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Fair, fair, fair

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
So let's talk

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Alright, what are you doing here?

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Uh, we would like to have a moment alone with Mr. Brown

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
This is my house, bitch, you're in my basement

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Well, we can take him outside to outside your house

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I don't think he wants that

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Alright, so here's the thing, I have a gun

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Which shoots the equivalent of tiny knives

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And you're holding the only bullet that you have

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Oh, you think so, do you?

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Well, I don't wanna, the reason why I got off of your friend is because I don't think that we have to do

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000
We have to kill each other in order to resolve this

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Well, I just feel like, you know, when you start fights while we're sleeping

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Your intentions might be other than that

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Hey, Nightblade, why are we talking with these guys?

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Let's just take Nightblade and get him out of here

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Uh, I shoot a Force V stun bolt at the guy with the knife

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
At the guy with the knife?

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Ooooooooooyzak!

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Alright, you hit him right in the face with a stun bolt, he goes down cold

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Yeah

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.000
I stand over his stun body and go, who's the bitch now, bitch?

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.000
And I take his knife and I throw it into a dartboard and it's a bullseye and I go, fuck yeah

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.000
And then I sheepishly take it out because it's mine and I put it back in my bag

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I feel like my healing helped

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Over the come, like I say, thanks, doc!

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Oh yeah, do you need a death touch for anything?

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Not just yet

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Do I have like zip cuffs or anything like that?

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.000
No, one of you might have handcuffs or something

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I don't

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
And there's always rope, I've got rope!

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I toss Nightblade some rope

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Alright, I use the rope to fake cuff him

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000
You use the rope

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Oh, can I use a taser dart?

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Uh, sure

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I use a taser dart and I try to put it in, uh, in, uh, McMahon's

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Wait, we can talk about this, we can talk about this

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000
You don't have got a taser dart in me

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Alright, so we're cool?

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I mean, no, I'm tied up in my friend's house and you just knocked him out

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000
We're gonna solve that problem, you're coming with us

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Let's get him in the truck and get the hell out of here, we gotta get to that

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Johnson will be pleased, Johnson's waiting in the truck for us, we'll get our money and we'll be done with this crap

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.000
And I use my skill of, uh, etiquette

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:02.000
And I say to him, like, it's going to be fine, we're gonna take care of you

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Just, just be cool

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
And we'll be cool

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Alright, okay

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I'm resigned to this

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Alright, he's resigned

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Alright, let's get him out of the truck, we'll give him the Baldwin, they can take the truck, the BTLs, we'll get an Uber home

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.000
You head back to the truck where you meet with Johnson, he's like, uh, hi, hey

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Hey

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Here he is, Johnson, we got your man, we got your BTLs

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I guess that's, uh, mission accomplished

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
We did our job, right?

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Yeah, that's only some

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:42.000
I'm really proud of staying in the truck and helping you guys out as much as I did

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
You know, Doc, you helped

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
I just appreciate your energy, it's calming and cool

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:53.000
So, Johnson, pony up the dough, we'll just call, uh, we'll call it a job accomplished

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:01.000
I mean, you guys were way late on delivering the Baldwin Brown, I feel like that's not, you know, it's not what we agreed on

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000
We're gonna use, okay, I'm gonna use Khan

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Okay

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I walk up to the Johnson

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Hey, uh, first of all, you smell great

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Second of all, I want to remind you that halfway through our mission, you told us that it was totally appropriate for us to take a little extra time

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
And actually, that's what you preferred

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Huh

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Don't you remember?

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
If you don't remember, you're an idiot

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Do you wanna be an idiot?

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
No, no I don't

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Alright

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I guess here's your money

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Thank you

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Yeah! How much do we get? How much do we, guys, count it up, what do we get again? I forget

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
1500

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
It was 5,000 a piece

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
5,000 a piece? That's gonna really low cost

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Alright

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
I buy a new hat

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:55.000
So, uh, I guess we give him the truck with the BTL chips in it and Baldwin Brown

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:03.000
And I go over to the Johnson and say, look, I know you don't want a lot of questions about stuff, but why do you want this guy so bad?

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Why do you want this guy so bad?

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Let me tell you in song

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
No, um, you know, that's none of your goddamn business

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Whoa, easy

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Alright, um, I guess because it's time to start wrapping this up, we all huddle up, which is a thing that we all do at the end of a successful shadow run

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:36.000
And then Mercy leads us in our traditional little, like, chant that we do when we run a shadow properly

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Yeah

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
We fought hard

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
We fought hard

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
We fought good

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
We fought good

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
We believe in truth

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
We believe in truth

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Get out of my truck

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000
And then we do this weird finger thing, da da da da da

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.000
And let's go bowling

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Bowling

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Cut to a montage of everyone bowling

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Also, let's all stick around and watch the premiere of season 6, episode 1 of Keep It Down

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
That's Harmon-John, thanks for coming

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Chris McKenna was our guest, Spencer Crittenden, Erin McGathy, Jeff Davis

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Everybody, I want to see a 37% standing ovation

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
5%

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000
5%

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
0%

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
102%

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
102%

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Thank you everybody, Chris McKenna, Spencer Crittenden, Erin McGathy, I'm Jeff Davis

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
How about one more time for Annie over here

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Our human being back there

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.000
What big loud boo for Jordan

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
I'm Jeff Davis, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Thank you very much for coming

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Did you get any of that?

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
It's a good show

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Oh
