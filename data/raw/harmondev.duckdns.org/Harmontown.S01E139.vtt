04:31.000\nI just stole some guys' joke\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:34.000\nYou credited him\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.000\nWhat was I talking about?\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nOh, Yahoo's great\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nYou're saying it was strange for the cast\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nIt's been a weird experience for them\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nThey're being treated like a cast of a TV show?\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nYeah, I mean...\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nYou would think it was 1995\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nand that we were getting a free rating\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nor something in the way that Yahoo\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\ntalks to the cast and stuff\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:57.000\nThey talk about doing Emmy campaigns\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nand promoting the show and stuff like that\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:02.000\nI've told this story before\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:05.000\nbut Kathy Sabat, the CMO\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nof Yahoo came to the set and visited\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nand she was like, gathered the cast around\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:12.000\nand was just filling them in on what we were going to be doing this year\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nand ten minutes into it\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nshe noticed that they were being really quiet\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nand she was like, are you guys...\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nam I offending you or something?\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nand then Ken Jong went, really sincerely\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:25.000\nyou have to understand, no one's ever talked to us like this before\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:30.000\nand it was really sad and delightful\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:33.000\nbut it is like, there's no enemies now\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:36.000\nand I don't know if it's going to have a positive\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nor a negative impact on the contents of the show\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nbecause I just work on it\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:42.000\nand now all of a sudden it's like\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nokay, well...\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nI have no...\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nYeah, if there's no Death Star\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nthere's no Darth Vader up there\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nwhy leave Tatooine, man?\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\nYeah, why not just make a show\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nabout going to Mos Eisley\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nand when that guy says like\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nI don't like you either, you go like\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nwell, why don't you get to know me?\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nand then you just like move into an apartment with him\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nand the...\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nthere could be structural issues with this season\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nis what I'm saying\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nwe got a B plus in Entertainment Weekly\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nNo, no\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nI sleep on my office couch\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nthis is an A minus show\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nI don't know what they give AAs to\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nHow many nights a week are you sleeping on the office couch?\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nAll of them?\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nLiterally all like week\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nlike Erin just like\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\njust hit a tipping point where she was like\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nwe either had to\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nidentify this as a problem\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nand therefore solve it with divorce\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nor we had to like look at this as like\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nthis is what it's going to be\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nuntil we're done shooting\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nand so like there'll be days where I just like\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nokay, going to sleep on the couch\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nand then I'll wake up and work on the show\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nbut now I feel self-conscious talking about that\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nbecause you're going to watch it and you're going to be like\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nyou slept on your couch?\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nIt's just a karate kid joke\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nI could have got home by\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nthree at least\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nalright

Is this a Barcelona chair?\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nI believe it's a reproduction of what they used to call\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\na Barcelona chair\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nWho is it by

right\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nYou're not going to burst that bubble\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nYou are certainly right to applaud and woo for that\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nThat certainly wasn't what would have happened\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nif your uncle had come up here\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nwith a drink in his hand\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nThis is nothing like just one of your weddings\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nWhat's going on\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nIt's actual entertainment\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nthat's worthy of being broadcast and paid for\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nYou're absolutely right\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nSo you're still rockin'\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nthe flannel\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\neven though it's a little arid out here\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nOh it's quite arid out here Dan\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:30.000\nThat sigh wasn't for you\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nIt was for me\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nAre we going to\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nplay something tonight\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nI don't care\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nI was thinking maybe we could start off\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nwith some checkers\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nmove into some tag\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nWe'll figure it out\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nDo you have a B in your bonnet\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\npolitically, socially, or economically?\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nOh man\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nI don't know\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nOkay so I listened to this radio station\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nthat's big claim to fame\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nas they're always talking about how commercial\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nfree they are\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nWell every commercial break\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nthey say commercial free\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nIt's stupid as fuck\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nbut the worst thing is they go commercial free\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nstarting now\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nthey play one song and then they do two minutes of commercials\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nThat's literally the opposite of commercial free\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nAnd this is the selling point of the station\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nis that they're commercial free\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nThey're saying they're commercial free\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nbut there are commercials\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nThey're saying they're commercial free one song\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nbefore playing a three minute block of commercials\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nMore commercials than music\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nBullshit\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nSo they're just letting you know the commercials are over\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nfor the time being\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nBut you'd also know that\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nif you started hearing the song being played\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nWhy are you listening to radio\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nYou're a star child\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nWhy do you even know about radio?\n\n10:48.000 -->

21:22.000\nOur advance\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nWe tried to make it\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nBut we're coming\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nWell my grandpa lied about his age so he could fight in World War II\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nWe're American\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nI don't know what that means\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nAlright Jordan, give me that beer\n\n21:34.000 -->

fine\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nBecause it's in those hands\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nOur nation has determined\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nIt refuses to lift things\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nManufacture things, export things\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nBut we're on it, we're an innovation\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\nEconomy\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:04.000\nDreamers, that's going to

male\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nWith a female question\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nI bet it's going to have eyelashes and a pink bow\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nThis question\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nIs there any\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nYou can muster what\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nIt's kind of related\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nDid you watch Gillian Jacobs on Girls?\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nI have not seen Gillian on Girls\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nBut I love the idea of her being on it\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nNo, I did not\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nDid you see Gillian on Girls?\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nI did not\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nThat really was a female question\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nYeah, I know\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nI felt like a stereotype\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nWill you say hey to Megan\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nBecause she's dying that she's not here\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nWill you say hey to Megan\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nBecause she's dying that she's not here\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nAll right, hey Megan\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nWe miss you\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nWe know you're that thing going on\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nWe're all pulling for you\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nSome of us\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nMore than less\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nBut anyway, Megan\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nCall me\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nWow, this is really\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nYeah, this is working out\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nThis is Gans, right?\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nBy the way, the show is so much better offstage\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nI don't know why\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nAll right, let's get Hanson Patton as well to ask\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nIf you were in front of a room full of people\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nAnd had to rank the Rocky Training Montages\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nFrom worst to best\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nWhat would you do?\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nOh boy\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nI'd rack my brain for all the Rocky Montages\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nI guess\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nThe one with the chicken?\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nYeah, the chicken one's got to be the best one\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nBut then you had\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nThe Carl Weathers one\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nI like the one on the beach\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nOn the Venice Beach\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nWhat about the one where they're intercutting it with Ivan Drago\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nAnd Rocky's like doing like\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\nOut in the snow doing real shit\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nLike high-tech 1990s\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nOr late 1980s\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nPunches a robot in the steroid\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nIt's at the height of like\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nRagonomics, it's like we're the underdogs\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nBecause the Russians have all of this\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nAmazing equipment\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nAnd poor little American Rocky\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nHas to train with a stick\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nIf you've ever seen\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nThe Russian arcade games\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nYou know\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nThey were all like top flight\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nOn top of all of their electronics\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nWe really like\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nI think we all miss the Cold War now\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nEven people that weren't born during it\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nBecause they must watch like movies and TV\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:58.000\nFrom the Cold War era and go man that was so\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:00.000\nSimple and innocent\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nThere was just a bunch of other white people\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nYou were kind of mad at\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nAnd so you made spy thrillers about it\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nThe only people that got hurt\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nWere people that their countries were too hard to pronounce\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nTo be on the news\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.000\nIt was great\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nTo watch movies\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nSupposed to be suddenly worried about\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nLike ducking and covering\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nRight? Yeah\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nThe idea that the world was at stake every\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nAll day because it was just about coke and Pepsi\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:28.000\nSo simple\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nAnd then those towers came down\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nOh that's funny\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nWhat a generation\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nOr the wall came down\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nAnd then it was like movies like\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nI don't know what is it the dream team\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nYeah dream team I think\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nWas a response to the Berlin Wall\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nComing down I'm pretty sure\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nNight breeders?\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nI think it's just night breed\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nThey don't care nobody cares\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nThat ends the segment\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nAsk Chris McKenna a question\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nI'm so sorry\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nNo it's just they don't\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nThey don't care about night breed I've talked to them about it\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nThey don't care and they don't care about\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nRace either that's really frustrating\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nSpeaking of how are you sir\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nYou're raising your hand\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nHow many meow meow beans\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nDoes Dan Harmon get\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nOkay that's a bonus question\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nFor you how many meow meow beans\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nWell\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nI don't know\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nIt's kind of a gotcha question\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nIt is because you know he's a man of the people\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nSo we should be a one or a two\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nRight\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nBut he's a secret elitist so\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nSix\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nAlright now that definitely\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:40.000\nEnds the segment\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nWhy you pointed at him\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:44.000\nYou had a really good question\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nHe has\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.000\nHe pointed at his beard\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nChris are you going to be playing\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:52.000\nShadowrun tonight\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.000\nOh\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\nOh\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nI wish I could take a picture\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nOh wait I've seen\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nI know the answer that sir\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nWe're actually going to bring Jordan back up\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nIs that the book I keep on seeing you with\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nI would love to\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nI've not been invited\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nDo you guys notice how unanimously the crowd\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nInstantly didn't like Jordan when he came up\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nA unanimous booing right off the bat\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nI don't know\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nI don't know if this show has ever had a villain\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nBut that guy seems like\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nAbsolutely\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nThe show's had a lot of villains but he really took the cake\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nHe was hard-bucked there from Die Hard\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nI feel like we're trading down\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nBecause last time I was in Austin here\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nWe had the guy that came up and talked about Bitcoin\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nAnd he was amazing\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nAnd he smelled good but he was doing the same thing\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nThat Jordan was doing\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nYeah but he was dynamic and awesome\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nAnd he smelled like delicious candy too\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nYeah\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nIt has to be observed that the guy\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nHe slid into that role and then he came back\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nAnd when everybody\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nHe came back with his backpack and then everyone was like\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nWaaaboo\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nAnd we never felt more alive\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nThe coolest thing about the Top Shelf app\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nIs that I'm not paying for this whiskey\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nIt's totally free\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:06.000\nI've been a community since season one\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:08.000\nIf there's anything that you need\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:10.000\nTo be more alive, it's a villain\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nYeah\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nYou absolutely need a villain\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:16.000\nYou've been surrounded by them\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nBy communities\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nYes, and Harmontown needs a villain\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\nIt makes it better\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nThere's no villain at Yahoo\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nThere's no overlord that you're fighting against\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nNo, we're scraping around looking for one\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nThere was a security guard\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nThat was bugging us for a while\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:34.000\nAnd there's that guy who won't\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nThat's some low-stakes potatoes\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nThere's a guy who won't steam clean the floors\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nFuck that guy\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nThere is a guy\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nAt CBS Radford that says\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nThat we keep pouring our coffee on the concrete\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nAnd he doesn't want to steam clean the concrete\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nBecause we pour our coffee on it\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nHe's insane\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nCan you imagine if a janitor was like\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nI saw that guy litter, I'm not gonna do my job anymore\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nAlso, nobody pours coffee on concrete\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\nHe's making it up\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nThat's where the garbage guy puts\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nThe garbage bags and all the garbage juice leaks\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:06.000\nUnder that spot\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nWe're the ones that are there 24 hours a day\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nConcrete steamer can\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nFuck off\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nI mean, I'd steam clean\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nThey could pay me to steam clean the concrete\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nI'd do it for fun, it sounds fucking amazing\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nI know\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nDoesn't it sound fun just to do once\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nBeing a DJ or a teacher\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nJust do it for an hour, steam clean concrete\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nIt sounds really cool\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nOkay, maybe I'm wrong\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nNo, you're absolutely right\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nI'd also like to tar a driveway\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nTar a driveway?\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nYeah, just for like 20 minutes\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nJust the tar, no asphalt on top\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\nJust lay the tar down\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nThis is amazing, I don't know\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nWhat do you do, if I don't put anything underneath\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nI believe tar is the adhesive\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.000\nThat holds the top surface\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nAnd what's the top surface made out of\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nJust driveway material?\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nIt's cement, isn't it?\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nWhat can't be\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nSee, this is amazing\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nYou don't put rebar on a driveway, madam\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nRebar?\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nThere's rebar in a driveway?\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nReally?\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nSuperhighway?\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nThink about it, bars are heavy\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nSorry\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nYou're right\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nIf you have\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nOne more thing to say about rebar\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nYou have to come up\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nDo you have more opinions about rebar?\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nNo\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nI took too long to explain that\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\nI was just saying\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\nYou'd have to come up if you\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:34.000\nYou appear to have a walker\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nI don't know that we could get you up on stage for that thing\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nAre you wounded? What happened?\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\nMy spine is collapsing\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:42.000\nYour spine is collapsing?\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:44.000\nNow you have to come up\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nNo, you can't\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nSorry, I don't know how much you can hear\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nWhat you can't hear\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nThis young lady started talking about rebar pipe\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nYou can't hear you\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:56.000\nShe has a walking device\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nShe has it because her spine is collapsing\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nThis is a story\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nThat we want to hear\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nJust sit at the edge of the stage\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nStand with her\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:10.000\nWe're getting you a mic\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nAre you comfortable there?\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:14.000\nWe're not making you do things that\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:16.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\nAnnie\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nAnnie's spine is collapsing\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nI have something called\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:26.000\nDegenerative Spinal Stenosis\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nWhat happened was\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.000\nIn December, I stopped being able\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nTo walk\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:34.000\nThat really sucked\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nWas there an event\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nThat Stephen Hawking story\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nWhere he's walking down the stairs\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nThere's one moment where you're like\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nI really wish it was more interesting\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:46.000\nI fell down in my hallway\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nI was carrying some laundry\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:50.000\nStephen Hawking was just a stairwell\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:52.000\nYou're just as interesting as him\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:54.000\nThat's perfect\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.000\nYou're walking in your hallway\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nAnd then you lost your ability to walk\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nLiterally\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nI was stuck there for a few hours\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.000\nI was in so much pain I couldn't move\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:06.000\nI also have something called sciatica\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nAnd when I get it I also can't walk\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:10.000\nSo I was thinking that's what it was\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nSo I had to crawl to a phone\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nWhich was really fun\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\nWith your arms like Stephen Segal\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\nIt was like war zone\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nWithout all the excitement\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:22.000\nThen I went to the hospital\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:24.000\nAnd I was in the hospital for a few weeks\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:26.000\nAnd they said\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:28.000\nThe stenosis thing\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nWhich is a phrase I've heard\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\nYou know that sound I make when I laugh\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\nThey think\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:36.000\nThat's like\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:38.000\nIt has something to do with cartilage\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:40.000\nGetting thinner or something\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:42.000\nIn the back\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nYou know how old people bend over\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.000\nAs they get older and they're leaning\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:48.000\nYou see them on their walkers\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:50.000\nAnd they look like they're all hunched\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nThat's actually because their spines are falling apart\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\nBecause the cartilage\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nWhy am I getting so clinical?\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nWhat's the payoff of me understanding it?\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nI got it! Good night!\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nPhone's coming together\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nThe important thing is the emotional side\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nHow old are you?\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nI'm 30\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.000\nEven if you were 70\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nIt's too long to find out one day\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.000\nThat walking is behind you\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nNo, totally\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\nThey don't want to operate on me\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:20.000\nBecause I'm young\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nBecause they can fuck that up\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:24.000\nAnd I would never be able to do anything\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:26.000\nEver again\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:28.000\nThey could paralyze me with the surgery\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nThat I would need to correct this\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nSo now\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\nWhat's the word prognosis?\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nWhat can you expect?\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:38.000\nWell\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:40.000\nI have to keep going to physical therapy\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nUsing this beautiful thing\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nAnd\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nI take a lot of pain medication\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nI get a lot of injections into my spine\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\nIs it going to get worse and worse?\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nYeah, it's degenerative\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nIt's not going to get any better\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nI can make the symptoms better\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nCan I actually have a sip of this?\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\nI was just going to tell you\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:02.000\nJordan's giving you a free account to Top Shelf\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:04.000\nWhen it's actually working\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nI would really need that, frankly\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\nIt is the least we can do\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nWith medications, I get dry mouth really easily\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:12.000\nAnd now you're talking to me\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:14.000\nYou said you could pill mouth\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.000\nSorry, I misheard that\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:18.000\nI take a lot of medications\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nSo I can dry hump easily\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nThat's not what she said\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nAlso true\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:26.000\nThe doctors will not operate under there\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\nWorried they could affect her ability to dry hump\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nThat's the last thing that\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:32.000\nThat's the last thing I really want\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:34.000\nIf I couldn't dry hump anymore\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:36.000\nLife wouldn't be worth living\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nAre you a dry hump fan?\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\nYou like your dry humping?\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nI think it's underrated\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nI think it is\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nIf you get a good dry hump\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nThat's a good night\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.000\nAbsolutely\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:52.000\nIf you get a good dry hump\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:54.000\nThat can almost be better than good oral sex\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.000\nI agree\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:58.000\nI think you're probably impressing people a lot\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:00.000\nWith your radiance\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nIn the face of something that a lot of people could use\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:04.000\nAs an excuse to be a pretty crabby person\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nThank you\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:10.000\nThat's all that dry humping\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:14.000\nI do my best not to be an asshole\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nIf there's anything we could do\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:18.000\nIn the context of a show\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:20.000\nThat otherwise has no direction anyway\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nWe would actually be thankful\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:24.000\nIf you just gave us something to do\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:26.000\nIs there anything\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:28.000\nSome kind of fantasy\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nOn this like the podcast?\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\nYeah\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nI'm a master improviser\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nI can create scene work\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nWorlds within worlds\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:40.000\nAw man\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:42.000\nI'd love to see you guys\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:44.000\nImprovise like a character ship\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:46.000\nLike\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nCreating fan fiction on\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nHave you ever seen the erotic fan fiction live thing\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nThat happens in LA?\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:54.000\nNo\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nErotic fan fiction live?\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nYeah it's like a podcast thing\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:00.000\nIt's somewhere\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:02.000\nSo it's like somebody is like\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:04.000\nSkully and then someone's like\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:06.000\nKirk and they just get on stage together\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nExactly it's like\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nI think it's also competitive\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nIt's like competitive erotic fan fiction\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nLike what this is\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nI'd like to see you and Chris\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\nDo a little erotic community fan fiction\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nYeah I would totally love that\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:22.000\nAnd I think we should\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.000\nUse your favorite characters\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:26.000\nWho do you want to see us do?\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\nWell okay so\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nI actually am in costume\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nRight now my favorite character is Annie\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nOh your name is Annie\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.000\nYou're gonna say you're kind of dressed like Annie\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:38.000\nYes it's true it's sad but true\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nI have a blog actually\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:42.000\nAbout Annie's costumes\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nIt's literally Annie's clothes\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nHave you had that for years and years?\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\nNo I actually just recently started it\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nBecause I've been cosplaying Annie for years\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nWhat did you think about season 5\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nAnnie?\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nI fucking hate pants and I want them to die\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nI\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\nI'm in such a difficult position\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:02.000\nThere because I love Annie the way she\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nAlways was but I also don't want to\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nI don't want to freeze her in time\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:08.000\nDresses and cardigans\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.000\nIt's such a winning combination\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nAnd now silk shirts what the fuck\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nDamn\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\nLike\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nI did a blog post\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nOf the whole season 6 promo\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nThat was just released the age of yahoo thing\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nLike almost every single frame\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nIs a silk shirt\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.000\nDo you know how hot silk shirts are?\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nRidiculous\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.000\nFirst of all I'll just say\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:34.000\nNobody was more pained than me\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:36.000\nTo tell Annie to stop dressing\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.000\nLike the way that we met her\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:40.000\nBut I felt like I was liking it for the wrong reasons\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\nAnd so I\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nLike I felt like she was supposed to grow\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nUp because and I felt like\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nI would see people that were watching the show\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nThey're growing up with Annie and they're like\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nI didn't want her to continue to be like this thing\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nBut okay so here's the thing\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nBecause your spine is collapsing\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nAnd because you're a good person\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nAnd because you like her\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nFor the right reasons\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nNow I have the excuse to say\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nWe have two episodes left to do\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nFor the finale\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nAnnie will start wearing\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nMid like above the knee\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nFloral\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nJust dictate it and take it down\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:18.000\nAnd I'll go to wardrobe\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:22.000\nYes\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:24.000\nWe can do this this is very easy\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nThey have a room full of clothes\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:28.000\nAnd you can just dictate\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:30.000\nI have a patent paper and\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nThis is fans effecting change\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.000\nSo okay from top to bottom\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:36.000\nWhat do you want start with the hair\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\nActually my only real request\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nWould be that I find out where you buy her clothes\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nBecause like the big thing\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nWith cosplaying right now is buying the same things\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nThat they have on the show\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nThis is actually the same sweater\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nShe wore in this episode\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nWell we can\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.000\nWe'll figure that out\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nI'm sure wardrobe would love to honestly\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nLike they\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nLiterally just nice dress\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nNice cardigan not too low cut\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.000\nShe's not a whore\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\nShe wore a back brace\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nAnnie be specific\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nGive us a color so that when you watch that episode\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nYou know that you actually have the same\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nI think it should definitely be yahoo purple\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nA yahoo purple\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nYou know maybe a little honda blue\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nLike something\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\nLike yellow\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.000\nLike a purple cardigan\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:26.000\nPurple cardigan\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nFloral dress\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nAnd flats\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nFlats and tights obviously\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nIf so desired\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:36.000\nI mean might as well\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nI don't want to step on anyone's toes creatively\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nYeah I mean I wouldn't I'm not going to stand in the way of\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nI think\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nAlright\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nSo you'll see the finale\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nThis is like a dream coming true\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\nYou have to remember that\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nYou have to remember that\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.000\nChris has to remember that\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:56.000\nI don't have to do anything\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nI'll talk to you guys\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nI'll remind you\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\nSo we're all watching the finale of that season\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nAnd we see Annie in purple and yellow\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nIt's because Annie here\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nYes because a real Annie\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nWho gave everything\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nYes\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nAlright well let's have a hand for Annie\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nThank you\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nThank you very much\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nYou're so sweet thank you\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nI hope to God\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\nThat when something bad starts happening to me\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:26.000\nI\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nI can start to become\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nA good person miraculously\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nWhat about Rebar\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nI don't know she knows about that\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nWe didn't want to like corner her about Rebar\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:38.000\nAt that moment\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:40.000\nAaron is here\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nMy wife\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nMy wife\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nLook at this dress\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nYou're like a creamsicle\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\nYou look like a creep\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nLike a creeper\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:12.000\nMinecraft\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\nHow does she look\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\nA creamsicle\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nAren't creamsicles orange\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:20.000\nAre creamsicles green\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nCreamsicles are green\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nSometimes\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nReally?\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nNo they're orange\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\nI got a little distracted\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:32.000\nHow is everybody doing\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:34.000\nWait now stop it\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nCreamsicles are any color they need to be\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:38.000\nBut they're defined by having cream\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\nIn the middle of them\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:42.000\nI disagree I think creamsicles are orange\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\nWith cream in the middle\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nAre all creamsicles orange\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:48.000\nThat's a very tepid response\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:50.000\nThere's some cherry ones\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:52.000\nBut there's not any lime creamsicles\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:54.000\nOriginally it was an orange and white affair\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\nBut I think they might have added other flavors down the road\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nBut not green though\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nI've never seen a green creamsicle\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:02.000\nThat's what I'm saying\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nThey're orange\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nAlright this guy\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nYeah high five\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nI came here in a petty cab\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nOh yeah?\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nBecause I couldn't get a ride out\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nThis guy's got a green creamsicle motherfucker\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nOh shit\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nBut this looks like a kind of\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nI don't know that looks like some black market shit\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nI came here in a petty cab\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nBecause I couldn't get a ride\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nAnd the petty cab had to go\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\nAcross the bat bridge\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nWhile people were gathering to watch the bats\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\nAnd it was a nightmare\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.000\nBecause I felt like I was doing some\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nWeird performance art because I was wearing this dress\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nThey're waiting for the bats but you're the only thing\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nThat they're getting\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nAnd then I heard\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.000\nOh princess\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nPrincess coming through\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:54.000\nAnd I got so bad that I started\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nKind of like holding my leg\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nTo imply that maybe\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nYeah that I was hurt\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nOh but I wouldn't give for a collapsing spine\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\nI'm kidding she liked it\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\nShe got it\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nBy the way a lot of Annie's clothes are from H&M\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:12.000\nYes and Forever 21\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:14.000\nAnd recently and more recently\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nJ Crew\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nBut you don't like that stuff\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:20.000\nThe recent stuff\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nIt's my fault\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nI'm sorry\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:26.000\nOh man\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:28.000\nSo you guys are all employees at Yahoo?\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:30.000\nCool\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nI heard resounding yeses\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nI know you're not I'm just kidding\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nIf you want\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\nCan we talk just about\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.000\nHow hard it is to be married to me\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nWhile I'm working on the show\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nSo that Chris can feel better\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nTell me about it\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nWe're kind of both married to Dan\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nChris is on his second kid\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.000\nWork wife\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nOur pilot\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nI mean it's like\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nIt's a big theme of this year\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nBetween me and Chris who are just\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nRunning the show without any kind of\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nWe're not like oh then there's\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nThat other guy that helps us and so\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:10.000\nWe're just kind of like not home at all\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:12.000\nAnd\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.000\nI just wanted to uncork that entertainment\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:16.000\nFountain\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:18.000\nI assume it's the same as\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:20.000\nBeing married to like a sailor\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nWho's off at sea\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nIt's very similar\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nWhen you watch the show\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nAre you gonna be like\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nNo but I'm saying when you watch it\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nIt doesn't premiere until March 17th\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nOn Yahoo\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nWhen you watch it\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nI'm really\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nThere's a syndrome that happens where\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nI haven't been home in three days\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nAnd then I can either come home for the fourth day\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:46.000\nOr I can stay and try to make the show\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:48.000\nWorth not having been home for three days\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:50.000\nBecause I keep picturing you watching the show\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:52.000\nAnd going\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nThat's exactly what goes through my mind\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.000\nAll the time\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\nWhen I miss my children's birthdays\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:00.000\nI go like\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nI'm like oh if she laughs a lot\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nThen she'll forget\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nRight?\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\nOr when your son Charlie is in a flop house\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.000\nAnd someone's like community's on\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nHe's like yeah it's real good isn't it\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nIt's worth it isn't it\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nAs he's trying to hide his swastika tattoo\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nOh look they're doing a karate\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nKid joke\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nGreat while he's getting\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nA big bang theory tattoo on his ass\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nOr something\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nYeah Charlie McKenna\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nIs going to be like the biggest big\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nBang theory fan in the world\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nI doubt I'll watch it\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:36.000\nI was the biggest fan of World War II Japanese\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nI doubt I'll watch it\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nWith a creative eye\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nI'm sure I'll just be very supportive\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nBut I will say that a couple days ago\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nMy dad and I were talking\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nLike it was after like a string\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nOf you not being home for four or five days\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nAnd Chris I don't want to like\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\nBelittle you not seeing your kids\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nBut we have two dogs\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nAnd\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nThat's more difficult than children\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nI know thank you\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\nI'm just kidding\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nEvery time I feel sad that Dan's not there\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.000\nTo see the dogs grow up I'm like oh no\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.000\nThey're human beings\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nI actually do like I'm not doing it to be\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nLike I\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nFor exactly the reason like sometimes Aaron\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nWill send me the hostage pictures of the dog\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nLike the dogs are being cute\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nAnd I will just like copy and paste\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\nA video of your kid\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nI put it back but I am just\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nIt does make me feel better\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nHis first time on the potty and stuff\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nBecause dogs never learn to talk\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nIt's harder\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:36.000\nLike your kids really slowly becoming\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:38.000\nSomething that can take care of himself\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nWhat would you do if one of our dogs\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nDid manage to talk\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:44.000\nAnd you weren't there for it\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nBig deal\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nI'd be sad\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nReally quick I was talking to my dad\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nThe other day and my dad's like\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nMy dad is obsessed with Dan\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nWhen is community premiering\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nAnd this is after like five days\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nOf you not being home and I'm like\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nCan you just not talk about her right now\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nI said her\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\nShe referred to the show as her\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:12.000\nYou guys are checked out\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nIt is very loud\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nOh you guys\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.000\nCan't hear\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nThere's mingling\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nHappening at the bottom\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nThe speakers are not pointed towards\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nThe frontist of Rose is probably the problem\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\nI'm up here just now\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.000\nI was having a great time\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:32.000\nI didn't know you couldn't hear me\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nI was like patting myself on the back\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nFor ignoring the sound\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:38.000\nI'm such a good performer\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nBecause I'm supposed to care about that\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:42.000\nBut they can't hear that\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nAnd then they're\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nBut\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nI'm very very excited\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.000\nAbout community and it's going to be\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:52.000\nIt's going to be great\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nDo you guys see that

hard\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:56.000\nYou guys have no booze back here it's just beer and wine\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nThat's terrible\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\nWe got to get more of that top shelf booze\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:02.000\nAnd get everybody fucked up\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.000\nRight now\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nDrinks are on Stephanie\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:08.000\nFree one round on

think that's the problem\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:18.000\nMumbling riffraff\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\nMumbling in\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:22.000\nIt's not going to last long\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.000\nYou push down on it like a cyst\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:26.000\nAnd it drains\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.000\nIt fills back up\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:30.000\nThey're having their cake and eating it too\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nThey're listening to the podcast kind of\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:34.000\nI don't mention it because\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:36.000\nI thought I would be being selfish\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:38.000\nBy mentioning it because I thought only\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:40.000\nFrom my last experience I thought\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nIt's something I can hear but they can't hear\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\nI could talk about this all day\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:46.000\nSo anyways\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:48.000\nCommunity is going to be\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:50.000\nBad\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.000\nAnd it's okay because I love you\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:54.000\nNo\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\nIt's going to be great\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:58.000\nDan how are you going to make it up here\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:00.000\nWhen the community is done being written\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:02.000\nWhat are you going to do to make it up all the time\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:04.000\nYou've missed together\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:06.000\nWell now that I'm dressing Annie for Annie\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:08.000\nI think I kind of like\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:10.000\nCan I make a request?\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:12.000\nCan you come home for dinner once a year?\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:14.000\nIs that okay?\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:16.000\nThe finale of Community\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:18.000\nCan you hug me?\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:20.000\nHi\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:22.000\nPurple cardigan and a yellow floral dress\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:28.000\nIt's very\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:30.000\nThank you\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\nWhat is your name and do you have a job that keeps you\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:34.000\nAway\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:36.000\nOh wait\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:38.000\nOh hi Jeremy\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:40.000\nSorry\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:42.000\nI'm just giggling because he was answering\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:44.000\nErnestly\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:46.000\nYeah\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nYeah\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:50.000\nIt's great\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:52.000\nHe's doing great\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:54.000\nI can't imagine a world where I watch\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.000\nCommunity looking for some reason\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:58.000\nWhy that's not, that's silly\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:00.000\nIt's going to be great\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:02.000\nI mean it's my favorite show\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nI love how it's about\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:06.000\nJust like friends playing pranks\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:08.000\nAnd there's the Asian guy\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.000\nThat's a ghost\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:12.000\nAnd there's\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:14.000\nThe personality\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:16.000\nIt's sometimes a black woman\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:18.000\nAnd sometimes a blonde woman\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:20.000\nAnd it's just fascinating\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:22.000\nIt's like no exit\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:24.000\nYou're John Paul Sartre\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:26.000\nI tell her stuff about the show\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\nThat you guys don't know\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.000\nThe whole thing is taking place\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:32.000\nIn a bag of\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:34.000\nPurell\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nThat at the end of it\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\nWipes his hands with it and goes\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:40.000\nEw\n\n58:40.000 --> 58:42.000\nHow do you feel about Purell\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:44.000\nEverybody on stage\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:46.000\nI feel like it doesn't belong in bags\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:48.000\nYeah\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nI don't believe in germs\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:52.000\nI don't like germophobia\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:54.000\nI think it's silly\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:56.000\nYou don't believe in germs\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:58.000\nI don't believe in making room\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:00.000\nFor them in society\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.000\nI think that human beings are\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:04.000\nPrimates\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.000\nWe've been here a really long time\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:08.000\nWe were born into a world of germs\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:10.000\nAnd when we disinfect\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:12.000\nEach other and ourselves\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:14.000\nCompulsively\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:16.000\nWe're just moving sand around\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.000\nA beach and making a problem\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:20.000\nIt's just very interesting coming from the man\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.000\nWho will only drink bottled water\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:26.000\nHe gave me the same speech when my five month old\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:28.000\nHad the croop\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nI heard she had the croop\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:32.000\nI wasn't there\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:36.000\nThat's not the same as being scared of germs\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nIt's insane\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\nWe're all constantly\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:42.000\nWhen you go into the bathroom\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:44.000\nI bet this doesn't happen in the women's room\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:46.000\nBut in the men's room\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:48.000\nThere's always a\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nRagged, grody\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:52.000\nThreaded hand towel\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:54.000\nThreaded through the door\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:56.000\nHandle\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:58.000\nBy some jackass\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nWho thought he was the most important person\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nIn the world and that you were a piece of filth\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nSo he's not going to touch the bathroom door\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nI don't understand what you mean\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nThe bathroom that when you leave the men's room\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nA stall door?\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nNo, the bathroom door\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nSo there's like this\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nHe doesn't care about his fucking gross napkin\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nHanging\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nAnd being on the floor\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nThe bathroom's a shit-sty because people who are afraid of germs\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nThey license themselves to make everything\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nDisgusting and filthy\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nThere's like a crap and piss everywhere\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nBecause everyone's not sitting on the toilet seat\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nAnd spraying their gross poop everywhere\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nSo you put your fucking ass on the piece of plastic\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nThat you share with the person next to you\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nThey're not a monster\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nYou are a germ!\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nYou're made of germs\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nYou're a blob of flesh\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nAnd blood\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nYou crawl out of the ocean, you carry it with you\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nYou're festooned with mites\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nAnd lice and fucking micro bugs\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nAnd grow up\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nAnd get over yourself\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nAnd share with others\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nI don't mind germophobia\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nUnless it's somebody's identity\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nOr personality\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nWhen they make it a thing\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nYeah, no one wants to hang out with someone\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nWho's defined by their fear of anything\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nI do have a problem though\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nI just spend a lot of time in bars\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000\nAnd guys don't wash their hands\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nBut the same guys, they see you\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nThey're just determined to shake your hand\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nI just saw you grab your dick and not wash your hands\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nI don't want to shake your fucking hand\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nThat's gross\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nI'll touch your dick, fine\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nIf you want him to touch your dick\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nHe'll absolutely, well he's coming up\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nTo make you touch his dick\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nMeet you Annie, we're going to dry hump\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nWe're going to touch your dick, it's going to be great\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nThere's a human being here\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000\nShould you come up here just to\n\n01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nBecause you probably\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nSo Dan, talk about\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000\nThe creation of the human being\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nI was in there for it\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nI was always obsessed\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nWith the idea of race, believe it or not\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nAnd the idea of\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nRacism being\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nSomething that people want to avoid\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nAnd then the idea of avoiding racism\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nSlowly becoming the most racist\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nActivity you could ever engage in\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nBecause you have to start actually\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nTalking about race as if it's like this palette\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nOf paint\n\n01:02:20.000 -->

lens\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nThe idea of separation\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nThe idea of nylon fetishry\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nThe idea of\n\n01:07:28.000 -->

haven't been to Temple Grandin on Rainy Street\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nYou don't have to talk to anybody\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000\nYou just go in and you get wrapped in gauze\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nAnd people pour drinks on you\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nTemple Grandin is a\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nWhen you first go in there they tell you\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nYou can't have a drink because the drink you're ordering\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nHas never been heard of before\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nBut then people start to believe in you\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nBecause your brain just thinks different\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nTemple Grandin changed the way that we treat\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nAnimals and slaughterhouses and did a lot\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nWait\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nDidn't Upton Sinclair do that\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nWell in a way\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000\nHe just pointed it out and then he was like goodbye\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nUpton Sinclair was about protecting\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nPeople from the health\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nIssues\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nRight\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nTemple Grandin actually was saying\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nWe are being enormously cruel to these\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nAnimals\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nAnd it's costing us money\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nIt's a good thing we fixed all those problems\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nShe's a savant and an amazing\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nGenius who has done a lot\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nThose balloons in the back are really cool\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nThey're like dip and dots\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nUpton Sinclair\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nKind of like the purell of the meatpacking\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nIndustry\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nYeah he was afraid of germs\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nSome germs are bad\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000\nWhen you're eating\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nYou came up pretty hard\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nOn germ people\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nI just mean the everyday\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nIf you're out and about\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nAnd you die of a germ\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nI'll give you a million dollars\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nDoes that include everything?\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nLike if you\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nGo in the bathroom right now with a q-tip\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nRub the q-tip on any toilet seat\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nAnd put it in a petri dish\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nAnd see what grows\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nThen take the same q-tip\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nWell not the same one\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nTake a different q-tip, rub it on your armpit\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nRub that in a petri dish\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000\nAnd does it know about Ebola or\n\n01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nI

It was kind of somewhere in between\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nBut it came through me and it was fucking amazing\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nYou got... Have we ever had standing ovations during a show before?\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nI don't know that we have\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:52.000\nNo, unless you count the Oscars that I won an Emmy for\n\n01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nThat got a standing ovation\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:00.000\nThat wasn't really me performing, that was Hugh Jackman doing when I wrote\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nBut Sean Penn stood up and he doesn't even like the country, so it's like, kind of found his joy\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nAlright, I say Spencer, let's play some badass high-action shadow\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nOh, you have a question, sir?\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nWhat's up?\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nI'm sorry about you, you brought Sean Penn\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nYou brought Sean Penn, and I'm Mexican, so I really want to know what you thought of what he said during the Oscars\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nAnd furthermore, I would like to know what you think about drug dealing in Mexico\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nThis guy's Mexican and he wanted to know...\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.000\nWhat did Sean Penn say? Are you talking about like the...\n\n01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.000\nHe said that he made the joke about the guy who doesn't have a green card or something like that\n\n01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nHe was just joking, right? He was just... I think they were just pals, yeah\n\n01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nDo you want to come up here and talk about it?\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000\nBecause you can\n\n01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.000\nMexican-Harmenian!\n\n01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.000\nYou didn't even do the knee crawl, he just stood right up\n\n01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.000\nSo you were just... I didn't see that part of the Oscars\n\n01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nSo Sean Penn made a joke and was it offensive to...\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nYou didn't see the last award, the best movie award?\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000\nI wasn't up for anything\n\n01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000\nFair enough, fair enough\n\n01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nSean Penn made it... Did you just make an offhand joke or was he being political?\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nWell, I think it was an offhand joke, but there was so much debate on Twitter that he was super racist and whatever\n\n01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000\nHe was just like, who gave this guy a green card?\n\n01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.000\nIt sounded like to me that he... I think he even knows the guy and he was making a joke about how hard we are on immigration\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000\nI think I didn't even have a green card\n\n01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nI think he was making... he was being ironic, right?\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nHe was doing a bit, like he was doing his impression of a conservative\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nI remember when we forgave him for beating the shit out of Madonna\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nWhat's that?\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nPenn beat the shit out of Madonna\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nI'm not sure about that, but...\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nWhat was your name? Sorry, I don't get your name\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000\nEric\n\n01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nWe've met three times\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nWhere's your green card?\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nActually, last time I asked you about your advice on me trying to get a green card so I could stay here and work\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nYou said, you know, sometimes you'll just have to admit that maybe you'll die under a bridge, but you'll die doing what you love\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000\nThat's what you said to me\n\n01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nYes\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000\nYeah\n\n01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nThat's true\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nI think you kind of...\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000\nEric, thank you so much, sir\n\n01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nAlright, Eric, Eric, Eric the Mexican, is that politically incorrect too?\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nIt's a nationality\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nMucho gusto, señor\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000\nSíntate\n\n01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000\nAlright, Spencer\n\n01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000\nDo we have our character sheets?\n\n01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000\nOh, I got them\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nOr should we just freestyle without us?
