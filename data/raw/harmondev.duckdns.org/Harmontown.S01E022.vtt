WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is once again in session.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Oh, yes.

00:20.000 --> 00:29.000
Would you please be so kind as to bow down and worship the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
Yo, yo, yo, hip to the hop, got the best rap, ever got the best rap

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna start the rap now

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Gonna rap about this, gonna rap rap that, gonna rap town

00:56.000 --> 01:10.840
I was trying really hard. I was just explaining to the cameras in the green room. I was like,

01:10.840 --> 01:16.960
okay, I got nothing. I'm not gonna say fuck your mama. I want to scrape my brain like

01:16.960 --> 01:23.800
dry toast and just like, yeah, well, it didn't happen. Just wrapped about rapping better.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.800
But that's a good first step. Like they say, if you want to quit drinking first step is

01:26.800 --> 01:31.640
to go, I drink too much. Was it the beat? So I'm saying right now, I rap a lot about

01:31.640 --> 01:36.760
fucking your mama. Maybe next week it'll change. Do you think there were... No, that

01:36.760 --> 01:40.240
beat was badass. You know, you liked that one. I was like... No, that one was really

01:40.240 --> 01:46.480
good. Yeah. I really liked it. Was there like a banjo in there? I don't know if there was

01:46.480 --> 01:54.920
a banjo. I felt like I kept picturing Kermit the Frog on a log, like fucking... Kermit,

01:54.920 --> 02:03.120
yeah, I catch the flies, I'm in a swamp now, gonna mump and fries. I can't do it. I'm thinking

02:03.120 --> 02:08.520
too much about fucking people's mamas and like, I won't be able to do it. Let's not

02:08.520 --> 02:21.360
start the show cataloging my inadequacies. Let's talk about Christmas. Santa Claus is

02:21.360 --> 02:28.200
here tonight. We got gay Santa Claus in the house. Look over here, you see a very tired

02:28.200 --> 02:38.600
Cupid. I thought it would never end. Wait, no, that comes after Christmas. You mean Cupid

02:38.600 --> 02:46.040
from Valentine's Day or Cupid the Rain? Yeah, I was further confusing. I meant from Valentine's

02:46.040 --> 02:55.940
Day. Just edit it all out. This will probably be our Christmas show because we're like seven

02:55.940 --> 03:03.240
weeks behind in terms of when we record and when we broadcast. I don't listen to him.

03:03.240 --> 03:09.120
The master does his work and then steps away from it. It's nice. The Dowdy Jing. It seems

03:09.120 --> 03:22.880
like a bigger crowd tonight. Maybe it's because Chevy Chase is not a kid. That was mean. That

03:22.880 --> 03:28.080
was just mean. I told you guys he called back and he wanted to do it, but he couldn't do

03:28.080 --> 03:31.640
it. Did you call him today? You said you're going to call him. I texted him. He couldn't

03:31.640 --> 03:37.440
do it. I also, hey, while we're at it, I also texted Bob Odenkirk. Okay, also cannot do

03:37.440 --> 03:55.400
it. Yeah. Also, Sid Caesar couldn't make it tonight. But hey, I fucked your mama. I got

03:55.400 --> 04:07.960
a new dance. It's not just side to side. Now you got a front to back little kicky thing.

04:07.960 --> 04:15.680
It's the, I'm afraid to look at the audience dance. I think I might have, here's the thing,

04:15.680 --> 04:27.520
I rarely do this, but I over or underestimated. I ordered too many drinks. I didn't calculate

04:27.520 --> 04:35.160
it right. So if I were a pilot and this were an airline, you should get off the plane. But

04:35.160 --> 04:39.240
you only paid $10. I promise I will try not to make it awkward. I didn't drink more than

04:39.240 --> 04:42.240
you would normally drink. You just did it too quickly? Yeah, I think that's what it

04:42.240 --> 04:47.600
was. Yeah, because the service there was so bad, glacial, so bad that I, when the guy

04:47.600 --> 04:52.440
came, how bad was it? It was, it was so bad that I kind of passed it because I was like,

04:52.440 --> 04:58.520
yeah, I'll have two more and the bill. You know, you ever do that when you're like, well,

04:58.520 --> 05:05.840
these things take so long, give me three now. And then they'll come like when I want them.

05:05.840 --> 05:13.120
And then they all came and I was like, but I have to admire the fortitude that you've

05:13.120 --> 05:16.480
showed by pouring yourself another one in the green room right before you walked out

05:16.480 --> 05:23.880
on stage. That's just habit. You know why? That's why. I mean, really, that's habit.

05:23.880 --> 05:37.240
It's not funny. I've been kind of stressed out. It's six days before Christmas for me.

05:37.240 --> 05:43.200
On the 17th of December, Erin McGathy and Rob Schrab and his girlfriend, wife, Kate

05:43.200 --> 05:49.520
Freund and I leave for London. So December 17th, that's well after everybody shuts down

05:49.520 --> 05:55.320
in Los Angeles. And so it's December 10th right now, something around there. I have

05:55.320 --> 06:06.520
six days to write a pilot for CBS, a pilot for Fox, and pack. Got to pack some fingerless

06:06.520 --> 06:11.680
gloves and research figure pudding. Aren't you the guy that was just boasting that you

06:11.680 --> 06:16.200
wrote Heat Vision and Jack at 36 hours? Yeah, that was at a different, much more joyful

06:16.200 --> 06:22.320
time in my life. That was when I didn't know the rules of television. I don't know, I don't

06:22.320 --> 06:27.640
know, whatever. I'm not, I'm not, these are... What are the rules of television, Dan? Always

06:27.640 --> 06:43.160
be closing. Right. Think dog. Could there be a dog in it? And when possible, ask yourself

06:43.160 --> 06:50.440
like, what would this be like according to Jim? I don't know, I don't know what the

06:50.440 --> 06:56.640
rule, you called my bluff. Congratulations. Call, I don't know how to write television.

06:56.640 --> 07:05.080
I never have. But... You got six days to write. Six days to write two pilots. Oh, there's

07:05.080 --> 07:10.720
a TV show. Dan Harmon's got 16. That's a movie, that's a movie. But that's more of a bravo,

07:10.720 --> 07:16.200
yeah. Like, maybe it'll be fun, but... Don't look down at bravo, you're gonna be writing

07:16.200 --> 07:21.840
for bravo one day. You're gonna be writing for bravo January. Right when I come back

07:21.840 --> 07:27.760
and Fox and CBS are like, hey, welcome back from London. What the fuck? And I go, sorry,

07:27.760 --> 07:34.960
I gotta go on tour. Okay, we have two notes. You're fired and you're never hired again.

07:34.960 --> 07:51.880
Okay, I'll address that. In Minnesota. Doesn't matter, I don't care. Christmas. I'm stalling.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.320
Saw the Avengers movie for the second time, but actually for the first time because I

07:55.320 --> 08:03.000
kept sleeping through it. Actually, I liked it a lot. I don't know who I'm talking to.

08:03.000 --> 08:13.840
Maybe not 92% rotten tomatoes liked it, but I like the Avengers. Okay, done. Also, I'm

08:13.840 --> 08:19.280
not gonna roll into one that's gonna put a barrier between us. Here's the second of

08:19.280 --> 08:24.560
three. Also, I was quite fond of the Total Recall Remake. I thought it was, I don't know

08:24.560 --> 08:29.600
if you call it a remake or not, but whatever. It was starting to, starting to ruffle feathers.

08:29.600 --> 08:36.760
But I think it can coexist with the Verhoeven Classic. They were both good. I liked watching

08:36.760 --> 08:42.160
Arnold run around Mars with the three titties and give the people their air. I also like

08:42.160 --> 08:47.600
watching What's His Name, not know that What's His Name was not his wife and what's her name

08:47.600 --> 08:54.680
actually was. That's why my one note is all the women look the same, but I have what used

08:54.680 --> 09:01.000
to be called Asperger's, which has now been removed from the diagnostic manual. I'm slightly

09:01.000 --> 09:08.200
autistic, so make one a redhead. If your movie has two women in it, always make one a redhead

09:08.200 --> 09:18.360
or make a Maria Conchita Alonso. Now, here's the point where we reach an impasse and we'll

09:18.360 --> 09:27.960
work through it. I liked Cloud Atlas. I would say, I would say Harmontown 50-50 on that

09:27.960 --> 09:33.160
one. Yeah. Okay. So Total Recall kind of was, okay, I put that in the wrong order. I liked

09:33.160 --> 09:37.640
Cloud Atlas. It was, it's weird. Like every, you're never more than five minutes in Cloud

09:37.640 --> 09:40.800
Atlas because there's a lot of, for those of you who haven't seen it and I won't spoil

09:40.800 --> 09:46.320
anything. I don't know if it's possible to spoil anything. It ends revealing humanity

09:46.320 --> 09:54.920
is amazing and goes on forever into the stars. But if you think about it, that's what Green

09:54.920 --> 10:03.880
Eggs and Ham revealed. So no big row to hoe there. But Cloud Atlas, because their whole

10:03.880 --> 10:08.000
shtick is reincarnation, I'm assuming it's based on some book series that made a better

10:08.000 --> 10:12.520
meal out of this. So then it's time to commit it to film and, you know, like, well, we want

10:12.520 --> 10:17.040
to create the sense. So there's, people are being reincarnated and that we're all kind

10:17.040 --> 10:20.280
of intersecting with each other and playing different roles in our lives. There's a lot

10:20.280 --> 10:26.920
of prosthesis, a lot of, like, six actors. And then there's like, you know, Tom Hanks

10:26.920 --> 10:31.240
will be like hanging out as a fisherman going like, it's hard to catch this fish. And then

10:31.240 --> 10:37.760
like, it'll go like, Geneva, 1814. And he's like playing a piano, but he's got like a

10:37.760 --> 10:43.080
weird nose. But then Holly Berry comes in, even though she worked on the fishing dock,

10:43.080 --> 10:49.440
but now she's like, you better compose that concerto, right? Every time they come in, they

10:49.440 --> 10:54.400
have a different forehead, a different, like, they have like, like, zany zappers on, or

10:54.400 --> 11:03.480
like a weird chin. You're never more than five minutes in Cloud Atlas from going, whoa!

11:03.480 --> 11:07.600
And that's not what you're supposed to do. The Cloud Atlas, you're supposed to spend

11:07.600 --> 11:16.720
the whole time going, oh, but you're constantly going, what did it mean, more or less jarring

11:16.720 --> 11:20.640
to just cast different people in those roles. But if you, for us to catch on that that was

11:20.640 --> 11:21.640
the reincarnated.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.880
Well, you never would catch on because there's too much to tell about. I bet in the, in the

11:25.880 --> 11:32.720
move, in the book, I'm sure you don't need rubber noses and the same actor to indicate

11:32.720 --> 11:37.880
to you that this person, I have no idea, did anyone read the book or book series? We got

11:37.880 --> 11:41.880
it, we got a, we got a, we got one hand, we have two, two gals here who read the book.

11:41.880 --> 11:42.880
All right.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.880
Is it, well, whatever, I don't know what to ask.

11:44.880 --> 11:49.080
Somebody gave me that book years ago and I feel like it's true, like, I liked not reading

11:49.080 --> 11:58.000
the book more than not seeing the movie.

11:58.000 --> 12:08.680
Oh, I made a joke. I joke about a book.

12:08.680 --> 12:09.680
Please reserve that.

12:09.680 --> 12:15.560
No problem. If you want to say where I have nothing to say, I don't know, that cat's out

12:15.560 --> 12:20.520
of the bag. Sorry I got you drunk tonight. I'm going to make it up to you.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.800
You seem exactly as drunk as you are every Harmontown.

12:23.800 --> 12:28.640
I guess I can tell. I don't know. I always, like, I have nights where I'm like, they

12:28.640 --> 12:33.840
can tell. Like, I, and I, and then I project that on to, like, if I'm talking and I go

12:33.840 --> 12:38.120
like, Hey, come on, it's Christmas. Hey, what's the deal with ornaments? And then I'll hear

12:38.120 --> 12:44.200
like a, oh, and then I'll go, she knows I'm drunk. She knows I'm too drunk. I'm not going

12:44.200 --> 12:47.200
to look at her.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
But uh,

12:48.200 --> 12:49.200
That was a guy.

12:49.200 --> 12:59.120
You pointed at the guy. Drunk. Can't, can't see anybody. It's all because of the waiter

12:59.120 --> 13:04.160
at the pikey. Another interesting thing about the pikey, if you're a local, we can edit

13:04.160 --> 13:09.280
this out because who in Boston's going to care about this. But uh, go over to the pikey.

13:09.280 --> 13:16.480
It's a kitty corner ish from here. It used to be the coach and horses and then it turned

13:16.480 --> 13:22.440
into this, this place. Uh, well, the big highlight for me is, uh, uh, alternate timelines. Givi

13:22.440 --> 13:27.480
Jeff Davis, uh, works there. There's like a guy, if you ever go in, he, he wears like

13:27.480 --> 13:33.840
these beige suits and he, he looks, he looks a lot like Jeff. It kind of like spends too

13:33.840 --> 13:38.200
much time on making his hair look like he didn't spend any time on it. And like,

13:38.200 --> 13:41.600
But if he like was from like 10s year is from like 85.

13:41.600 --> 13:46.640
Yeah. He's getting vaguely, very vaguely multi-ethnic. Like you don't know where from

13:46.640 --> 13:50.720
where it's like, like his mom was, you know, worked on the docs of his dad was a minister

13:50.720 --> 13:58.120
from, uh, but he's a, yeah, he's very, very creepy, very creepy version of Jeff Davis.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.520
But there's also a very lovely guy up front. There's a black dude named hallelujah, which

14:01.520 --> 14:04.920
is an awesome name. Yeah. Hallelujah is a good name.

14:04.920 --> 14:13.800
Seems like cheating in the, in the name. Okay. My name's awesome. Let's all, let's all just

14:13.800 --> 14:18.680
go fuck ourselves. All right. My name's butterfly. Like some of us have to hunker down and be

14:18.680 --> 14:24.840
John or hallelujah is not cool, but I don't want to jump all over this guy. Never met

14:24.840 --> 14:38.960
him. Already jealous. Uh, I, uh, oh shit, you're fucked up. Yeah. Should I pick you

14:38.960 --> 14:45.720
a slower beat to rap to a slow beat to rap? Like a slow rap, like a slow regretful rap.

14:45.720 --> 14:59.840
I feel like maybe what it, you know, I usually go with the stationary mic stand, but maybe

14:59.840 --> 15:04.720
maybe like, I should loosen up so that you can't tell. I think that I think the mics

15:04.720 --> 15:10.760
in a stand like helps you know how drunk I am. But if I, if the whole thing's moving

15:10.760 --> 15:17.200
then you can't tell, right? I seem sober now. Give it some of that, give it some of that

15:17.200 --> 15:32.840
dame cook karate moves. You know, dame cook it up. Let's try the slower beat. Yo, yo, slow

15:32.840 --> 15:43.480
rap, you know, a slow rap, you know, a slow rap. No, that didn't work. You just kept

15:43.480 --> 15:50.280
saying slow rap. Well, I, I've worked my way into it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:50.280 --> 15:57.640
Slow rap. Like if you're just going to keep saying slow rap, I will clear this room.

15:57.640 --> 16:05.520
All right. I need to start immediately. No, no, no, no. He's into it. He's into it. Slow

16:05.520 --> 16:13.560
rap. Yeah. Yeah. You've made that quite clear. Am I allowed? Yeah. Yeah. Slow rap. Yeah.

16:13.560 --> 16:23.520
Slow rap. Cities coast to coast. Gotta motherfucker knows the most. Gotta put your mama on some

16:23.520 --> 16:31.280
toast. I gotta go to fuck your mama's ghost. I gotta, because I fucked her to death. I

16:31.280 --> 16:39.000
gotta did too much crystal meth. I fucked your, I fucked your mama to death. And then I fucked

16:39.000 --> 16:46.800
her, fucked her harder to death. I gotta fuck your mama in a slow rap. Fuck your mama slow

16:46.800 --> 16:54.480
as crap. Fuck your mama all over the stage. Fuck your mama. I'm a third level mage. I

16:54.480 --> 17:02.800
gotta put some cast in a spell. Fuck your mama up from heaven to hell. Fuck your mama like

17:02.800 --> 17:17.400
my name was Snoop. Fuck your mama in the button felt poop. No, weird. There's a disconnect

17:17.400 --> 17:24.160
here. And I'm supposed to rap about that. We found your tempo and also found your audience.

17:24.160 --> 17:31.640
Who are you guys? Did all the colleges get off for Christmas? Like all of a sudden, like

17:31.640 --> 17:37.080
we're fucking like this is amazing. You felt her poop when you fucked her. Where have you

17:37.080 --> 17:41.920
guys been? You know, Dan, they've been at college and they miss their mothers. You brought

17:41.920 --> 17:48.000
them back home. Sick of hearing about Kierkegaard. Just feel someone's poop. There's no place

17:48.000 --> 18:00.960
like home for the holidays. So I guess the hobbit's gonna be three movies. Well, someone's

18:00.960 --> 18:09.480
not okay. Who said okay? You're into it. All right. Can you come up? Do you want to come

18:09.480 --> 18:17.360
up and talk about it? He asked you would you get up on stage? Because the audience isn't

18:17.360 --> 18:25.600
Mike's for the podcast. We don't bully people here. We don't make fun of people for coming

18:25.600 --> 18:30.880
up. I just like to hear people and meet people. Have you been here before last week? Oh,

18:30.880 --> 18:40.760
okay. Does this work? Yeah. I'm not that tall. Yeah, you are. I'm as tall as you. Are you

18:40.760 --> 18:47.880
like a height arexic? You are exactly that tall. It's pointed at your mouth. Dan, Dan.

18:47.880 --> 18:53.920
I used to work at a rehab center and they would in the eating disorder unit, they would

18:53.920 --> 19:00.360
do this. Like they told me this. They for anorexic women, they had this therapy technique where

19:00.360 --> 19:05.040
they would have them draw how big they thought their body was, and then lay them down in

19:05.040 --> 19:10.600
it and take a picture of them. Like, what is this? Sesame Street? Is that how anorexial

19:10.600 --> 19:16.280
works really? You can actually just think that your physical body is it? Anyways, I don't

19:16.280 --> 19:24.440
know. What's your name? Who's the villain? What's your name? Phil. That's okay. You don't

19:24.440 --> 19:29.960
have to be Thor. Phil, I'm gonna have to do this because tonight is a no Mike stand night.

19:29.960 --> 19:35.760
You're gonna have to, Dan, cook this. There you go. Put that Mike stand away. Yeah. I'm

19:35.760 --> 19:41.400
enforcing the no Mike stand rule. All right. We're all like, there's not much to talk about

19:41.400 --> 19:46.080
with the Hobbit. It's probably gonna be nine hours. It's probably gonna be extended to

19:46.080 --> 19:51.560
12 hours. But okay, I read the Hobbit. Yeah. I did not so much read the Lord of the Rings

19:51.560 --> 19:56.400
trilogy, but it was a, the Lord of the Rings trilogy was a trilogy in book form. Yes. So

19:56.400 --> 20:01.240
they made a movie for each book. The Hobbit was one book. Yep. So if they make a, where

20:01.240 --> 20:07.640
the red fern grows movie and they make it three movies, we get to go, what is the first

20:07.640 --> 20:12.720
movie going to be about the red fern growing? Are they never going to get to the Coonhounds

20:12.720 --> 20:22.720
dying? I mean, they can kind of stretch it. Spoilers, sorry. The Coonhounds die. I mean,

20:22.720 --> 20:26.720
there's, there's a lot to stretch with that movie. There's, there's a war that just happens

20:26.720 --> 20:32.560
to be only like 50 pages from what I remember. Yeah. And they're making Anna Karenina one

20:32.560 --> 20:38.600
movie. That book is long. That's like a 900 page book, 1200 page book. I read that thing.

20:38.600 --> 20:44.560
You could make 18 movies out of that. Oh, it's true. Well, I said, are you, are you,

20:44.560 --> 20:48.080
will you accept that you're up here in defense of the Hobbit being three movies in the face

20:48.080 --> 20:54.800
of a society that is crying out? Why not, why not merge these kill bills into one 90 minute

20:54.800 --> 21:02.480
thing? Like, kill billboards. And you're saying the reason why, I mean, I would call it kill

21:02.480 --> 21:07.440
billboards. Like I just found out five minutes ago and I'm already defending this. You just,

21:07.440 --> 21:13.400
I told you. Yeah. You found out from me that the Hobbit's three movies. I thought it was

21:13.400 --> 21:25.400
true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm Nikki Fink. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Deadline Hollywood news

21:25.400 --> 21:32.640
comes from me to your neighborhood. I got the ear to the Hollywood ground. I got some

21:32.640 --> 21:39.880
new scoops from the Hobbit I found. I heard the date line LA is three movies. Oh, shit.

21:39.880 --> 21:47.640
Some people think it's not groovy, but motherfucker, MC Phil's all right with it. Now we're going

21:47.640 --> 21:52.480
to fight with it. Stupid. But you told me it was four movies. I would have been okay

21:52.480 --> 21:58.400
with it. Okay. So your, your point being prolong the enjoyment rather than have to sit through

21:58.400 --> 22:03.760
the like, like, like they make 50,000 shitty movies a year. When Peter Jackson's behind

22:03.760 --> 22:08.640
the camera and the content is, is he directing them? Yes, I hope so. Certainly not going

22:08.640 --> 22:16.600
to ask you. I know where you get your news. You're saying as long as Peter Jackson's behind

22:16.600 --> 22:20.320
the camera and they're, and they're in New Zealand and there's, and there's, and there's,

22:20.320 --> 22:25.840
and they're dealing with that awesome original like material, you'll watch it forever. Yeah.

22:25.840 --> 22:29.240
Like, you know, you hope that every movie is eight hours long and there's one a week.

22:29.240 --> 22:33.560
I saw King Kong in theaters. I'm like, I may have thought that was a half hour long, like

22:33.560 --> 22:40.400
maybe two and a half hours too long, but I still saw it. Right. All right. Well, all

22:40.400 --> 22:44.560
right. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to, it's hard to tell them to fuck off. I've never read

22:44.560 --> 22:49.760
Tolkien, but I really like the Lord of the Rings films. And I, I don't mind it being

22:49.760 --> 22:54.480
prolonged entertainment if they're all good. Well, certainly the appeal of the Tolkien

22:54.480 --> 23:03.800
universe, if I can call it that. No, you may not, sir. Let's ask Janet Tolkien. Absolutely

23:03.800 --> 23:13.400
no. Yeah, I heard she's the black sheep of the family. I heard half of the Silmarillion

23:13.400 --> 23:25.200
when upper nose. Half of the money. Like that was it. Not this half. That was it. That was a deep cut Tolkien reference.

23:25.200 --> 23:34.920
All right. Well, okay. I mean, yeah, the appeal of the Tolkieniverse is the texture. The feel

23:34.920 --> 23:41.960
that you're there, but I'm serious. Like, let's see. Have you read the Hobbit? Yes. So, so let's break

23:41.960 --> 23:46.640
the Hobbit up into three parts. Breaking the Hobbit up into three parts. Where do you think the first

23:46.640 --> 23:52.720
movie is going to end? Like, probably when they reach the dragon, probably you probably, no, no, no.

23:52.720 --> 24:00.680
Wait, dinner is when it will end at the dinner. And the second movie will begin with Jesus Christ,

24:00.680 --> 24:06.680
so many dishes. I can't believe we ate all of that lasagna. But we should think about fighting a

24:06.680 --> 24:12.720
dragon. And so it came to pass that they thought about fighting a dragon. Dan, this guy here has a

24:12.720 --> 24:18.440
pretty good opinion about where he thinks the first break. Oh, Jesus, this guy? Yeah. All right. You

24:18.440 --> 24:22.680
told me you were gonna rate my soul last week. Yeah, we did it. We did a bit. You were very good. Thank

24:22.680 --> 24:30.160
you. Remind us of your name, please. Ben, my name's Ben. Ben, welcome back. Ben. Thank you. Last week,

24:30.160 --> 24:37.560
we kept pretending he was Greg Barrett, and then he was at the show. For my understanding of it,

24:37.560 --> 24:42.320
which is fairly limited as well, it's that the third movie is actually going to be another book that

24:42.320 --> 24:53.840
comes between the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings series. No, am I wrong? Get up here. Come on. No,

24:53.840 --> 24:59.440
you stay. Stay. Because this is how the first Hobbit movie is going to be. As far as I understand

24:59.440 --> 25:04.600
the book, it's just a bunch of fucking dwarfs, like, like, crowding into a hobbit. Hey, I'm here. Let's

25:04.600 --> 25:09.880
go ahead. That's going to be the whole movie. We're halfway through the first movie. Is the first

25:09.880 --> 25:17.440
movie just going to be a Tom Bombadil movie? I don't know. I don't know. I get it. Tom Bombadil was

25:17.440 --> 25:22.040
cut out of the first Lord of the Rings, and a lot of fanboys got very upset. This character was cut

25:22.040 --> 25:27.560
out. The original plan for the Hobbit movies was there was going to be, the Hobbit was going to be

25:27.560 --> 25:31.600
one movie, and then there was going to be a second movie, which was going to bridge the Hobbit with

25:31.600 --> 25:37.240
the Lord of the Rings, which people got upset about because there's no literary reference to

25:37.240 --> 25:46.000
bridge. I don't remember the name of it. I don't remember the name of it, but there is a book that

25:46.000 --> 25:58.480
took, what's it called? Get up here. Get on stage. Somebody Instagram this immediately. This is

25:58.480 --> 26:04.880
Falcom and Malcolm and Tookin and Pookin. Are you guys talking about the Lost Tales? Is that what

26:04.880 --> 26:11.040
you're talking about? No. There was that compendium of that Christopher Tolkien found in, I'll shut

26:11.040 --> 26:19.480
it up. That's Mormon. All right. Unrelated. Again, my knowledge is as limited as these gentlemen,

26:19.480 --> 26:33.080
but there's a bunch of... Everyone keeps saying that, but... Terry. Get up here. We're getting a

26:33.080 --> 26:40.160
bigger stage. Okay. They're breaking the Hobbit into three movies. Wait a second. There's a guy

26:40.160 --> 26:48.040
who's a bartender from the pikey. Okay. The first movie is the travel to Smog, the dragon, and then

26:48.040 --> 26:52.400
the second movie is all about fighting the dragon. And then the third movie is about Dale and the

26:52.400 --> 26:57.000
battle of the five armies. And they're taking additional information from the Simerillian to

26:57.000 --> 27:02.280
fill in when Gandalf left for 90 pages and then came back and they're just making it up based off

27:02.280 --> 27:07.040
of like 20 minutes or 20 pages of him being like, oh, I thought Sauron, blah, blah, blah. That might

27:07.040 --> 27:15.960
be kind of cool. When he fights Sauron, the wizard or whatever, they fill that in and they're

27:15.960 --> 27:21.400
going to show it instead. So they get all the way to the precipice of fighting Smog. But they don't

27:21.400 --> 27:27.520
actually do it. But that first Lord of the Rings movie, they didn't get a lot done, but it was very

27:27.520 --> 27:33.720
exciting. Yeah, it's mostly walking. So they fight Smog the whole second movie, which would be pretty

27:33.720 --> 27:39.760
badass. I've actually never read the book. Guaranteed you Empire Strikes Back. He's never read it. That's

27:39.760 --> 27:45.560
all right. He doesn't have to. If this was about literature, this wouldn't be a billion dollar

27:45.560 --> 27:57.200
industry. How much have you guys read today? But all right, so what's your name, hero, from the

27:57.200 --> 28:03.040
middle audience? My name is Tyler. Tyler. You've never read the books, but you know more than

28:03.040 --> 28:10.480
these guys who have clearly read these books. Well, I saw that like 1988 cartoon that has the hobbits back

28:10.480 --> 28:21.480
then. Did Ralph Bakshi direct that? Yes. See, that's all I know about talking. You guys get so mad when

28:21.480 --> 28:27.080
you agree with things. I grew up on that stuff, like seeing it and not knowing it from, yeah, I was

28:27.080 --> 28:33.000
just like being disturbed by it, like that and Watership Down. I'm afraid to watch it again

28:33.000 --> 28:40.960
in adulthood. All right. Well, it's cool that you wore a Newsy cap because you really brought extra

28:40.960 --> 28:47.800
and made us know all about it. There are fanboys that are here. I just had to come represent, I guess.

28:47.800 --> 28:54.840
All right. Well, I guess let's have a hand for the Fellowship of Looking Forward to the Hobbit.

28:54.840 --> 29:11.840
Next week is going to be Jane Austen, ladies. Yeah, sharpen your corrections. Don't know. All right.

29:11.840 --> 29:20.760
That was exciting. It gets exciting fast here. You never know what's going to happen. I can't believe

29:20.760 --> 29:30.120
that. There are guys shaking each other's hands. The Newsy guy went and sat down and then the guy in

29:30.120 --> 29:37.040
front of him turned around and was like, thank you for whatever you did. You represent something up

29:37.040 --> 29:44.600
there. I don't know what you said. They might work together, but I want to think that he was like,

29:44.600 --> 29:51.360
thank you so much for what you said. It was so brave. It reminds me of my jury duty story. Did

29:51.360 --> 29:55.520
I ever tell my jury duty story up here when I was in Milwaukee? If you didn't wait before podcast

29:55.520 --> 30:00.600
time and probably before. I'm going to breeze through it really fast. I tell the story as much as you

30:00.600 --> 30:04.760
do probably because this is the greatest, greatest day of my life. It was the only day when I was as

30:04.760 --> 30:10.000
much a hero as the Hobbits and the Bobbits. Will you give me a favor? Will you take this five minute

30:10.000 --> 30:16.760
story and break it up over three podcasts? Get us into your current driving two jury days. The first

30:16.760 --> 30:22.520
one takes you to me showing up at the courthouse and then I insert a whole scene where, yeah,

30:22.520 --> 30:36.120
Sean Astin says, think about it this way. You're right. This is a good ending. I went to jury

30:36.120 --> 30:42.240
duty. The year is 1972. Close. It was like 90 something. I was still in Milwaukee. It was a very

30:42.240 --> 30:48.840
young, spry little child, little writer and improviser living in Milwaukee. I went to jury

30:48.840 --> 30:54.600
duty. Never gone to jury duty before. You spend the whole time. You get quickly indoctrinated into

30:54.600 --> 30:59.760
the culture of, I got to get out of here. We're the suckers. We got to get out of here. People

30:59.760 --> 31:05.480
explaining it to you. No one's going like, congratulations on jury duty. They know that

31:05.480 --> 31:10.160
they need to ingratiate themselves to you by saying, sorry, you're at jury duty. They're right

31:10.160 --> 31:18.600
to do that. It's a drag if you're over 12. It might be exciting for someone who still thinks

31:18.600 --> 31:23.480
pencils might be spaceships. You could maybe occupy yourself. Everyone else wants to kill

31:23.480 --> 31:32.960
themselves. You spend the whole time getting called and not called. You're told you're on the

31:32.960 --> 31:39.520
precipice of getting dismissed. We were so close to, me and my group, we were so close to getting

31:39.520 --> 31:45.560
out and then we got called for this case. We're like, fuck you. At that point, you go through

31:45.560 --> 31:51.600
phases where you go, I kind of actually, I don't want to seem uncool to my peers here, but I actually

31:51.600 --> 31:56.840
kind of think it would be cool if I got called in and someone murdered someone and I had to decide

31:56.840 --> 32:00.560
you murdered someone. You have these thoughts in your head. I'm going to be a juror. It's going to

32:00.560 --> 32:05.480
be amazing. But then you, that quickly fades and you go, I got to get out of here. Please let me,

32:05.480 --> 32:11.760
I'm so close. And then they call you and you have to go and you shuffle into the courtroom. And we

32:11.760 --> 32:17.320
end up in the jury box and it's all kind of random. And I ended up the juror number one. I was like

32:17.320 --> 32:24.080
sitting in the front. It's kind of randomly arranged. And it's, there's this kid sitting there.

32:24.080 --> 32:32.720
It looked like he was like 16 years old. No idea how old he was, but yes, the defendant. I checked

32:32.720 --> 32:45.960
the judge. Sorry. No, I will edit out whatever bored you. I just, I just, yeah. Slow. Slow story.

32:45.960 --> 32:52.440
Sorry. No, no, it's not a slow story. I just, go ahead. Turns out the kid was like a, it was like a

32:52.440 --> 32:59.960
pot, like possession thing. This kid lived in the outskirts of Wisconsin. And he was walking down a

32:59.960 --> 33:05.440
highway. They, they give you all the details of the case. And he was, he was walking down like a

33:05.440 --> 33:14.920
county highway in his like little rural area of the, of the, of the, you know, free fire zone. Sector

33:14.920 --> 33:21.600
seven, where there's probably nothing to do but smoke pot. And he, a cop started coming, probably

33:21.600 --> 33:27.840
to the only cop where he lives. And he, the kid like had a pipe and it had a little bit of resin in

33:27.840 --> 33:34.680
it. And he, he like chucked his pipe into like a bunch of corn. Like a walkie is just why he was a

33:34.680 --> 33:40.440
cop coming and kind of went like this. Cop like stopped and got out and went through the corn and

33:40.440 --> 33:47.160
found the pipe and, and, and took the kid in and, and at some point the kid apparently, this is why

33:47.160 --> 33:55.520
he's my hero must have exercised his right to trial by jury because here I am now and, and, and, and

33:55.520 --> 34:00.800
these other people and, and, and they, so they explain the details of the case. And then they go,

34:00.800 --> 34:04.680
they say the thing that's like, if I'm sure most of you have been in jury duty, there's like that

34:04.680 --> 34:12.480
moment where they go, does anyone feel like they wouldn't be able to be in partial in this case? And

34:12.480 --> 34:17.320
then like, you see like the Jehovah's Witness lady, raise your hand and you watch her get to walk the

34:17.320 --> 34:21.760
fuck out. And you're like, where is Jehovah's Witness? Like you're like, you're trying to like,

34:21.760 --> 34:25.480
and then the, and then the person who was a victim of a, because they have witness in the name.

34:26.960 --> 34:31.160
It used to be this, this has changed now, by the way, because I just recently did jury duty in LA

34:31.160 --> 34:35.680
and they were like, fuck you, fuck all of that. Like there, there, there's a portcullis comes down

34:35.680 --> 34:41.120
and they're like, nice try, asshole. But back then it was like someone went, I'm a Jehovah's Witness,

34:41.120 --> 34:45.680
get the fuck out. I can't sit in judgment of others. And then someone else, I was a victim of a violent

34:45.680 --> 34:50.960
crime, fuck you. My friends at cop, go fuck yourself, get out, go home, go play Nintendo. And

34:50.960 --> 34:57.000
you're like, well, and so this one was like handed to me on a silver platter, because the truth is

34:57.000 --> 35:02.160
like, of course, I'm not going to judge this impartially, like leave the kid alone. It's like,

35:02.160 --> 35:08.600
like he might end up being a senator if you don't bust him now for a fucking dumb ass pipe full of

35:08.600 --> 35:13.080
a stupid thing that goes out of the ground. It's like, arrest the cop, throw him off a cliff.

35:13.080 --> 35:19.160
Like, I'm sure neither choice will measurably improve society, but there's a better chance that if

35:19.160 --> 35:27.720
the cop like exploded, I'm in part, I'm not impartial. That's my point. I'm partial. I have a

35:27.720 --> 35:35.800
feeling and a cop killer. I don't mean that. I just mean that they exploded. If you're a police

35:35.800 --> 35:43.600
officer, I don't drive a silver Prius. I don't really, I'm not like, there's a lot of great people

35:43.600 --> 35:47.040
who are cops and whatever. I don't mean that. And you would like to see them explode apparently.

35:47.040 --> 35:57.200
I meant like biologically like sci-fi wise. I didn't mean like, like, like El Ceda. See what

35:57.200 --> 36:02.080
societies become. This story takes place in a different universe before a lot of things went

36:02.080 --> 36:08.280
down. The judge goes, does anyone think that they wouldn't be able to be impartial about this?

36:08.280 --> 36:13.720
And my hand shot up like a rocket because I was like, holy shit, I actually can't be impartial.

36:13.720 --> 36:19.080
I'm going to get out of jury duty. I raised it and everyone kind of chuckled, like, who was this

36:19.080 --> 36:26.240
young man's hand sure went up fast? And I was the, I was, I was juror number one, which made me the

36:26.240 --> 36:30.600
jury foreman should it actually go to the thing. And then they're like, okay, sir, what's your

36:30.600 --> 36:36.320
problem? And I said, well, I just don't, I don't think that this law should be a law. So I think

36:36.320 --> 36:39.640
that any kind of legal proceeding about it the whole time, I'm going to be thinking like, well,

36:39.640 --> 36:43.920
let's just get out of here. And I think that makes me like, I'm not going to be able to be

36:43.920 --> 36:50.720
impartial because I, it's a, I don't, I don't, I don't see the crime here. And, and they're like,

36:50.720 --> 36:55.320
well, no, but it is a crime. We didn't ask you if you think it should be a crime. We asked you if,

36:55.320 --> 36:59.760
if, if you think you could judge him in part, like they started really really laying into me.

36:59.760 --> 37:04.680
And I was like, well, yeah, but I'm telling you, like the customer is always right. You asked the

37:04.680 --> 37:11.080
question. Like, do you think that I would be able to judge it impartially? Like, like, who are you

37:11.080 --> 37:17.880
going to believe over me when I say no? And what better answer than because I don't, because I

37:17.880 --> 37:21.880
think this is a plant that grows out of the ground. And I don't think he was hurting anybody. And I

37:21.880 --> 37:25.960
don't, I think that, you know, it's your business. If you, you know, the larger society wants to

37:25.960 --> 37:30.480
have a big war and like some kind of controlled substance. And I can't step into that because

37:30.480 --> 37:35.680
that's a big mess. But I see a kid and I see a dumb pipe and I see a lot of ways to time. And I

37:35.680 --> 37:39.680
want to get out of here. And I think it's like, you know, I just kind of like answered honestly.

37:39.680 --> 37:45.680
And then, but then they, they kept like, then the prosecutor got up and was like, no, I want to ask

37:45.680 --> 37:49.480
him a question. Now, but don't you understand that it's illegal? It's yes, but I don't think it

37:49.480 --> 37:54.480
should be. I don't think it should be. I don't know how many times to say this. And so we went back

37:54.480 --> 38:02.840
and forth for like 10 minutes. It was crazy. And I'm not exaggerating. Like, I hope you can trust me

38:02.840 --> 38:07.120
by now to know that like, I wouldn't exaggerate. Like I told you, I shoved a sharpie pen at my

38:07.120 --> 38:14.480
ass. I don't like, if this story involved me being less than amazing, I would tell you the weird

38:14.480 --> 38:19.600
thing is I was awesome in this story. It was an accident. They made me awesome. I just went back

38:19.600 --> 38:24.960
and forth with them. And, and, and so then they're like, fine, whatever. And then so then because I

38:24.960 --> 38:32.320
was juror number one, and everyone watched that happen, then they go, okay, let's move on. Does

38:32.320 --> 38:37.640
anyone else feel that they would be in part not be able to be impartial and like eight hands went

38:37.640 --> 38:45.360
up, including and I'm not kidding. It was like a fucking like, like romcom, like an old, old woman,

38:45.360 --> 38:51.080
like a really old, like, brought knitting to jury duty, like, like not ironically, winota rider,

38:51.080 --> 38:58.000
who knitting, but like, like, like, like knitting like her clothes for things like for cat, like,

38:58.000 --> 39:04.080
raised her hand like everybody and they went down like, okay, now, what about you? And I was like,

39:04.080 --> 39:09.320
well, I think it's, you know, I guess like the young man said like, and then everybody they went

39:09.320 --> 39:14.480
down. I was like, well, I guess it's like he said, I guess. And every and the judge was like this is

39:14.480 --> 39:20.800
like clapping his hand. Because humanity is a resource. It's like so you like green in the

39:20.800 --> 39:27.440
courthouse, like they need to flood these channels with human fucking bodies. And and and you can

39:27.440 --> 39:33.600
revolt and go, no, we you need us to technically make the courthouses work. We don't want to be here.

39:33.600 --> 39:38.800
We want to poop on you. It's in the Constitution. You're they tell you when you go to jury duty

39:38.800 --> 39:42.240
that you're only there to judge the evidence. But in the Constitution, it actually says no,

39:42.240 --> 39:47.520
you're also there to judge the validity of the law. You're there because you are the law. You're

39:47.520 --> 39:51.280
judge dread. You are allowed to say, what if I don't like the law? They go, that's not what we're

39:51.280 --> 39:54.880
doing. They go, well, the Constitution says otherwise. And if you say, if you, by the way,

39:54.880 --> 40:01.120
if you want to get out of jury duty, stand and go, what's the court's stance on jury veto? They go,

40:01.120 --> 40:07.360
see you later. They will validate your parking and give you a fucking bean burrito. And so all

40:07.360 --> 40:11.760
this, everyone's got it was late in the day. And everyone's going like, I think what the young

40:11.760 --> 40:18.480
man said, I was like, he wasn't hurting anyone. And the judge went, guys, and the two lawyers came

40:18.480 --> 40:28.080
up, and they all walked away. They all left. And then, and then they went to the kid who was

40:28.080 --> 40:36.800
sitting there. Now, nobody but the jury, the jury just sitting there. Like, are you smoking a big

40:36.800 --> 40:42.960
cigar at this point? Not quite. Well, yeah, I guess in my head, I am. But like, but, but this is

40:42.960 --> 40:46.960
the thing that reminds me of that moment when the guy turned and congratulate because the old

40:46.960 --> 40:54.080
woman who was sitting in front of me, she turned in her chair and she put her ginger paper, a

40:54.080 --> 41:01.280
wonderful hallmark hand on my thigh and said, I just want to tell you, I think what you did was

41:01.280 --> 41:14.960
very brave. I love getting high and I want to get out of jury duty. And I'm, I'm also brave.

41:15.840 --> 41:21.120
Amazing jackpot. And everyone was like, yeah, yeah, I was afraid to say something because I was

41:21.120 --> 41:24.320
afraid, you know, it's like, it's a courthouse. And then they're going to come to your house. So

41:24.320 --> 41:28.640
like, do you guys comfortable living in that society? You really think that if you're in

41:28.640 --> 41:32.720
Trudy and said, well, I got a problem with this, that you'd go home and there'd be a cop going,

41:32.720 --> 41:40.640
wow, smarty pants. Sounds like you like the reefer. Now we got your name and number.

41:40.640 --> 41:48.400
We'll shut you down, Herman. Stay away from the pool hall. Make that happen sooner than later if

41:48.400 --> 41:52.480
you think that's possible. But that's, but now that's what's closer to the world we live in now

41:52.480 --> 41:57.520
for certain. Probably. Yeah. Well, because you sure can't get out of jury duty anymore. But and so

41:57.520 --> 42:03.040
like, I want, I want, I want the, the, so the judge comes back with the lawyers, everybody,

42:03.040 --> 42:14.000
the kid is going, he's got a big giant smile on his face. And the judge says, so what happened is

42:14.000 --> 42:23.920
it's late in the day. And we, we just sort of settled the matter in chambers. And so there's

42:23.920 --> 42:29.600
no more case. And you guys are free to go, but I would like to talk to you in the hallway.

42:29.600 --> 42:34.720
The judge said, to get the jurors. Yeah. Like, well, can you please meet me around front?

42:34.720 --> 42:39.440
I'd like to talk to you for a moment. So you're all free to go and get up out of the

42:39.440 --> 42:45.600
juror box and we all walk over to the doorway where the judge in his little robe, big robe,

42:45.600 --> 42:51.360
sorry, society, and his crown, can't, can't, can't came over. And he got, it's like,

42:51.360 --> 42:54.960
you guys are free to go. I just want to let you know, you know, I don't approve of what you did

42:54.960 --> 43:06.720
in there, but I approve of the system that let you do it. I think it's amazing that you're able

43:06.720 --> 43:10.160
to do it. And that's, you know, a lot of people don't understand that's what the justice system

43:10.160 --> 43:15.280
is based on is your ability to do what you did. And I don't, you know, I think, I think something

43:15.280 --> 43:20.640
bad happened in there technically, but that's my own personal point of view. As a, as a, as a legal,

43:20.640 --> 43:25.920
as a legal person, I admire what happened in there. I mean, I don't, but I do. And it was like,

43:25.920 --> 43:32.880
shut up. He was basically saying, as far as I could understand, I don't want to, I should be

43:32.880 --> 43:37.600
illegal, but you guys are legally allowed to override. Yeah, exactly. Like, like, like, like,

43:37.600 --> 43:44.160
why don't you take that 15 year old kid and ruin his life for smoking weed? Because you're,

43:44.160 --> 43:51.440
because Thomas Jefferson said you could fuck off. Like, he was like mad, but like also didn't want

43:51.440 --> 43:55.920
to make his forefathers mad. Like, so weird. Well, he was a guy that actually read the

43:55.920 --> 43:59.680
constitution. And when you go to the, I went to jury, dude, I've been there a couple of times.

43:59.680 --> 44:04.640
And the first time I was there, I was like, I don't know, I was in college, maybe 18 years old.

44:04.640 --> 44:08.480
And I was sitting there in a daily courthouse down there. I don't know if you guys have been

44:08.480 --> 44:14.320
there, but it's, it's a bummer. And I'm sitting there and there was this bunch of people that

44:14.320 --> 44:18.080
sit in there. Some people are really happy about it. They got their juror badges on. They're really

44:18.080 --> 44:22.880
excited about it. This is my civic duty. I get to be involved. Like, that's totally fine. If you

44:22.880 --> 44:27.120
want to be there, that's a good juror, probably. Someone that wants to be there. I really, I'm

44:27.120 --> 44:31.440
interested. I would like to check this out and hope I get a good case. A lot of people are like,

44:31.440 --> 44:34.960
I got a kid, I got a babysit later on, I got to go to school. And like, how do I get out of this

44:34.960 --> 44:40.400
thing? Well, there was a silent radio going by at the speed of sound. Like a little red, you know,

44:40.400 --> 44:46.080
digital thing going by. And it was all in mumbo jumbo legalese saying like, in the event that

44:48.080 --> 44:52.400
Latin terms and stuff like that. And I read it once and I waited for it to cycle through again.

44:52.400 --> 44:57.360
It's also where the snack bar is and where the restrooms are. And I grabbed this woman next to

44:57.360 --> 45:02.640
me. It's like, you know, housewifey lady next to me. I'm like, read this with me. And tell me if

45:02.640 --> 45:05.920
you think this is what it's saying. And what it said is, if you don't feel like you should be here,

45:05.920 --> 45:11.040
you can walk up Hill Street. And if you have the blues by being here right now, you can walk up

45:11.040 --> 45:16.240
Hill Street. And you go to the fourth floor of a thing and you can say, you can throw out a form.

45:16.800 --> 45:22.160
And I read it three or four times. And I just got up and walked out. And like some guys like,

45:23.040 --> 45:30.240
whoa, where you going, man? I'm like, I read that thing. I've been trying to read that thing for

45:30.240 --> 45:37.200
half an hour, but me too. It's like, I picture it as like green matrix characters. You can read that?

45:37.200 --> 45:44.320
Yeah. But yeah, but like the silent radio, like it goes by and says a pizza, hard number is like,

45:44.320 --> 45:47.680
it goes by too fast. Like no one's going to get your delivery number on the silent radio out in

45:47.680 --> 45:54.400
front of hard times pizza. It goes by too fast. And so I got in the elevator and then like,

45:54.400 --> 45:58.000
there was really like a hand stop, the elevator from closing and there were like seven people

45:58.000 --> 46:03.360
that were like, we're coming with you. And then like other people saw that we all got in and

46:03.360 --> 46:07.920
there's people are getting out and they were coming toward us. So we walk up a block across

46:07.920 --> 46:11.760
like Hill and whatever that is, hope or something like that. And we walk up the street and then we

46:11.760 --> 46:15.680
go on a thing and we go and elevator and we look behind us and there's 15, 20 other people come

46:17.200 --> 46:27.760
and they're like, and I was so I didn't want to be there. So we go up to the fourth floor of the

46:27.760 --> 46:33.280
place and an elevator door open and a bunch of like women mostly that work there and a little

46:33.280 --> 46:37.520
cubicles saw the elevator open and they saw 20 people come out. And they was like,

46:41.520 --> 46:49.600
once a month, somebody reads that fucker. Another Pied Piper. So they give you a form and says,

46:49.600 --> 46:54.080
why don't you want to be here? And you can say, you can say this, you can say that. There's like

46:54.080 --> 46:59.600
two lines. If you if it's not one of the four things they give you as reasons, you can say why.

46:59.600 --> 47:03.760
And I was like, I don't believe the way the criminal justice like operates in the system,

47:03.760 --> 47:07.840
operates. I went in this big like, you know, Emma Goldman, like, I think like, it's like,

47:07.840 --> 47:13.120
like, the system's on trial. And I was like, I wrote on the back of it and filled it up.

47:14.320 --> 47:18.960
Okay, this guy's going to be a bad juror. So I get there and they read through your stuff and

47:18.960 --> 47:23.200
this woman, she says black lady, she had like, like, like, like, you know, crosses and very, like, a

47:23.200 --> 47:28.240
very Christian black lady, like, very, very nice and very tired of her job. And she I said that,

47:28.240 --> 47:33.520
she goes, All right, Jeff, she's looking at it. She's reading, she's like, she's reading the French.

47:35.440 --> 47:39.440
And she's he's like, turns over to the other side, she's got this, I just dense writing,

47:40.400 --> 47:46.640
like Chaucer on the back. And she reads, she gets like halfway through, she goes, Jeff,

47:46.640 --> 47:51.360
Jeff, I can't give them this, they're going to make you be a juror, just go in there, tell them

47:51.360 --> 47:54.480
you don't want to be there, they'll probably let you out of it. I go, I don't want to spend the

47:54.480 --> 48:00.480
rest of my week, like, going to jury juror selection and doing like, I don't want to be here. And

48:00.480 --> 48:05.920
like, I can't say that. And I go, What can I say? What can I write on this piece of paper that gets

48:05.920 --> 48:17.040
me out of it? And she goes, and she stands up a little bit and looks over. She's so sick of me. And

48:17.040 --> 48:23.520
the job. And she says, she looks back down, like she makes your nose wasn't just say religious,

48:24.560 --> 48:35.120
I'm like, Religious, she's just right religious on the card. I thought, Religious, like Jeff,

48:35.120 --> 48:41.840
Davis sign it. So I had John Hancocked it. And she goes, you're free to go. I'm like,

48:42.800 --> 48:46.240
tell everybody that she's like, if we told everybody that there wouldn't be any juries

48:46.240 --> 48:51.840
in there anymore. Now you can't so I got another summons 10 years later, I thought I thought I was

48:51.840 --> 48:57.360
off to the books forever. I thought that was, you know, that guy was like done with that. No,

48:57.360 --> 49:02.160
they changed the system. I got the jury thing again, and I wrote religious this and that and

49:02.160 --> 49:07.760
then you got another thing back that said, get your ass in here. Nice try or go to jail. So I

49:07.760 --> 49:13.920
got beside I went online and I read about juror veto and I was prepared for that one. But fortunately,

49:13.920 --> 49:18.880
I actually had a thing. But I went in the last I would do juror. By the way, I would do jury duty

49:18.880 --> 49:23.040
now. I'm not that busy anymore. I would do it. I'd be interested. I think that's how I felt is

49:23.040 --> 49:28.400
like the same way I feel about software piracy. Like I stole my ass a lot of Adobe shit. So if I

49:28.400 --> 49:34.800
need Photoshop, I made enough money off of using Photoshop for free. Like they if I have it, like

49:34.800 --> 49:40.000
they get it and we all it all worked out for all of us in the end. Like when I was two when it went,

49:40.000 --> 49:46.800
you know, when that $5 a day wasn't going to cover my rent. Yeah, I was like fuck jury duty. But

49:46.800 --> 49:51.520
now I'm like, Okay, this will be I'll go in. I'll do my duty. It's a duty. Like if nobody did it,

49:51.520 --> 49:55.600
what the fuck are you gonna do? What about that kid who's got caught smoking pot by a dick cop?

49:55.600 --> 50:00.320
Like, like, there's a kid out there, you could make a difference. So I so I went into the LA

50:00.320 --> 50:05.760
Superior Court, and I went through two days of this business. And and I'm not it was just funny

50:05.760 --> 50:10.640
because the, you know, went through all this thing. And I was like, like, my heart was pumping,

50:10.640 --> 50:15.440
I'm like, am I going to try to get out of it? Am I going to like try to say I won't be impartial?

50:15.440 --> 50:20.080
But I watched them pick off one by one. And by pick off, I mean, not pick off, like, like,

50:20.080 --> 50:27.040
people tried to get out of jury duty. It just said, like, no, it's a religious. And they're

50:27.040 --> 50:33.760
like, fuck you sit down. Welcome to the jury. And how about you, man? But it got disturbing

50:33.760 --> 50:41.600
because there was a woman who stood up and said like, like, I'm a writer and sometimes an actor

50:42.560 --> 50:47.520
have even dabbled in directing. I think I can tell a lady faking being the victim of a violent

50:47.520 --> 50:54.240
crime and not wanting to be a part of this and being emotionally traumatized by it. And she was

50:54.240 --> 51:02.160
either Meryl Streep or was I watched a woman get abused a second time by the system, because she

51:02.160 --> 51:07.520
was like, I just can't she was fucked up about it, because they tell you the details of the crime.

51:07.520 --> 51:12.240
We got this guy stabbed this guy, and then this thing happened. And she's like, I can't do this.

51:12.240 --> 51:15.920
I've been through this before. This is not this is not what she's already been on the panel when

51:15.920 --> 51:22.240
they're saying they really she's on the panel. Oh, so this is real juror slash. Yeah. And it was

51:22.240 --> 51:27.440
okay. Good. Sit back down. And it was like, like nobody got let go. They did not do any of that

51:27.440 --> 51:32.160
business. And I was in the elevator with her. And I turned to her was an awkward moment because

51:32.160 --> 51:37.920
I didn't I turned to her and I said, like, I can't believe they didn't let you go. And she

51:37.920 --> 51:44.480
responded to me like, like really emotionally. So like, I wasn't trying to get let go. I was just

51:44.480 --> 51:49.280
being honest. Like, like, I she thought that I was saying like, yeah, jury duty, right? Fuck this

51:49.280 --> 51:53.200
shit. But I can't believe they didn't buy that. You know, like, you know what I mean? Like, like,

51:53.200 --> 51:57.920
like, I felt like I was part of the I was like, no, I just meant like, I can't believe the government

51:57.920 --> 52:04.240
is terrible and raped you in there. But but it felt like I was God, God, it was the worst. But at

52:04.240 --> 52:08.000
the end of it. So I'm not like, okay, I'm doing jury duty, because I just watch this lady get

52:08.000 --> 52:17.360
trounced, like, I'm not going to go up there and go, no, no, no, I'm racist. I'm not doing it.

52:18.560 --> 52:23.600
I'm just so I can tweet it. And like, because that lady is going to be haunting me for the

52:23.600 --> 52:28.560
rest of my life. That that jury duty is duty. So I saw it. So that better be the name of this

52:28.560 --> 52:40.160
podcast. So I so I hunkered down for the due diligence. And we end the whole day. And then I

52:40.160 --> 52:45.120
go home, I'm busy as fuck. I'm like, I got to go back. It's a bummer to have to go downtown. It's

52:45.120 --> 52:50.320
blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, first world problems. But I go back, and I'm there. And we

52:50.320 --> 52:54.720
show up and we're waiting outside the courtroom. And we wait and we wait and we wait. And the guy

52:54.720 --> 53:02.160
comes out at a certain point goes like, there's been a development. And you can go to lunch.

53:02.160 --> 53:07.280
So I went to lunch. This was the day that the space shuttle was being flown all around LA. I

53:07.280 --> 53:11.040
don't know if this is an important part of the story. But it was an odd experience for me because

53:11.040 --> 53:16.640
I had no idea. I was on jury duty. It was just like, like, I got to get a drink. It's it's 11am.

53:16.640 --> 53:22.320
And I've never I never hang out downtown. So I'm just like walking. I looked on my

53:22.320 --> 53:28.240
para street and you go have you have a margarita. I looked on my phone for martini icons and was

53:28.240 --> 53:33.920
like following it. And as I'm walking across this park, there's like this industrial park.

53:35.440 --> 53:42.000
It was like a zombie movie. Like, everyone was like looking at a fixed point in the sky. And I

53:42.000 --> 53:48.080
kept like nine times I kept looking for like a suicide jumper. And there was never anything I

53:48.080 --> 53:51.520
just kept walking. I was like, maybe this is what happens to people when they work downtown. Like,

53:51.520 --> 53:56.560
maybe they maybe they're like cattle. Maybe they're just grazing freedom. Like, they're just looking

53:56.560 --> 54:02.240
at the moon. Like, what would it be like there? You could live in a crater and

54:03.760 --> 54:09.920
like, no one would ever fuck with you. Just keep looking at it. Just suck it up into my eyeballs

54:09.920 --> 54:16.240
for another six hours of data entry. And I finally couldn't stand it. It was like, what? I just stopped

54:16.240 --> 54:22.800
this one lady. I was like, it didn't stop her. She stopped me. Whatever. Harmon. There's a footnote

54:22.800 --> 54:26.960
session. The the I said, what are you what is everybody looking at? I'm really sorry. And

54:26.960 --> 54:34.640
she's like, you don't know. I was like, I don't know. It's just like the space shuttle's coming.

54:35.680 --> 54:42.320
I was like, what do you mean it's coming? Like, what? What do you mean? I still didn't understand.

54:42.320 --> 54:49.920
The Williamsburg wagons. They got honey. They got scarves. I did a new scarf from Neptune.

54:49.920 --> 54:54.160
Like, I was like, I thought, did they decommission that fucking thing? I go, what? What do you mean?

54:54.160 --> 55:00.000
It's why is it coming to Los Angeles? What is it doing here? And, and, but I was like,

55:00.000 --> 55:06.800
space shuttle's coming. And I just, I just kept walking between people and went into an empty

55:06.800 --> 55:11.200
like P.F. Changs or something. It was like, give me everything you have behind the bar.

55:11.200 --> 55:15.280
Because I had to go back to jury duty. Watch that figured it out on the TV. They're like,

55:15.280 --> 55:19.280
oh, they're taking the space shuttle everywhere. They're flying it all around all over the goddamn

55:19.280 --> 55:24.720
place for some reason. Some weird while that while you were there, I was, uh, I got a text from

55:25.440 --> 55:29.760
Dino and you saying the space shuttle's flying around. Right. And Dino was saying he was at the

55:29.760 --> 55:33.520
drawing room, our little local bar. It flew right over the drawing. And I was like, what as I live,

55:33.520 --> 55:38.960
you know, like, you know, half a mile quarter mile from there. I'm like, I didn't hear it go by.

55:38.960 --> 55:43.040
And so I was sitting on my toilet taking a shit as you know, as one does. And I, uh, and I hear

55:46.080 --> 55:49.760
and I was like, please let my phone be here. And I grabbed my phone, pulled the blinds up,

55:49.760 --> 55:54.720
and I have a shot I put on Instagram of the space shuttle flying over my bathroom window.

55:56.240 --> 56:00.560
I just watched it on the news. Everyone in the bar was like watching in the TV and they're

56:00.560 --> 56:05.440
going, it's coming. It's coming. And then they would, they would, they kept running out. I was

56:05.440 --> 56:11.280
like, it's looked better on the TV, like way better. I don't know. No, it looked pretty cool.

56:11.280 --> 56:15.120
But I have friends that were like on downtown. There's a cash register here now. It was really

56:15.120 --> 56:19.600
low. They saw that thing, incredibly low. So I go because they were tooling it. I mean, I guess

56:19.600 --> 56:22.960
that's kind of cool that they were like just showing it off. I was like, fuck you to the rest

56:22.960 --> 56:26.800
of the city is that bid to have it in their museum. And it was like, we've got your space shuttle,

56:26.800 --> 56:31.680
fucker. It was like LA going like, yeah, it's cool to be in LA. There's more here than just riots.

56:31.680 --> 56:40.480
There's, there's, there's, there's outer space. Hey, hey, hey, black people, we may, we may expand

56:40.480 --> 56:49.440
out so much that, that you, you, you stop being the victims of crime. Okay. That was reverse

56:49.440 --> 56:55.760
rate. I was, I was being Ellen Alda about that. The, so I go back, I traipse my corpse back to the

56:55.760 --> 57:02.880
courthouse and, and we wait again for another like hour and a half. It's like, so, so to recap here,

57:02.880 --> 57:09.360
like the whole, like from morning to lunch, like we were just waiting and something weird happened

57:09.360 --> 57:13.680
and the bailiff just told us to fuck off and go have lunch and come back. So we all come back.

57:13.680 --> 57:19.120
So now I've been downtown all day. I come back, we wait another hour, the bailiff comes out and

57:19.120 --> 57:24.800
goes like, or I'm sorry, he goes, come on in guys and we all shuffle in and we knew someone was

57:24.800 --> 57:30.240
fishy because he didn't tell us like six, seven, four, go to the left. Like there was no, it was

57:30.240 --> 57:35.200
just like, get in here assholes. And so we all shuffled in and sat down and the judge was like,

57:35.200 --> 57:45.360
well, uh, uh, Johnny, Johnny Carson, this is weird wild stuff, but you're free to go. It was,

57:45.360 --> 57:51.120
he didn't explain anything. It was like, you're free to go. Okay. All right. It was like, what

57:51.120 --> 57:56.080
happened yesterday? They were at the elevators and, uh, I saw one of the attorneys and they tell you

57:56.080 --> 58:01.200
don't talk to the attorneys until after the case. And so as I said, one of them waiting for the

58:01.200 --> 58:06.960
elevator, the case is over, right? So can I ask you what happened? And, uh, and the prosecutor

58:06.960 --> 58:13.600
looked at the DEA. Am I getting those terms right? Uh, probably assisted DEA. Uh, well, yeah, I'm

58:13.600 --> 58:19.440
sure it wasn't, uh, yeah, Sam Waterston wasn't there. Uh, I just mean the two, there were the

58:19.440 --> 58:23.360
two opposing attorneys and they kind of looked at each other like, as if to ask themselves like,

58:23.360 --> 58:28.400
is it okay to answer the question? And then, and then said, yeah, uh, he didn't show up.

58:29.680 --> 58:34.320
So this, this kid who needed a translator in court cause he was like, it was like,

58:34.320 --> 58:38.480
it was a gang thing. Like he stabbed somebody and I'm assuming I'm allowed to talk about this

58:38.480 --> 58:43.920
now. I'm not blowing the roof off of this thing. There was a stabbing and blah, blah, blah. And

58:43.920 --> 58:47.600
he had a translator in the courtroom and the translators could only work in shifts. So there

58:47.600 --> 58:51.840
was like always some James Carville guy walking in and trading on, like tagging out. It was the most,

58:51.840 --> 58:56.800
it was the weirdest thing in the world. This kid just sat there for a day, wasted my fucking time.

58:56.800 --> 59:01.680
Don't stab me kid if you're listening. Uh, and then the next day he was like, I'm gonna fuck this.

59:02.720 --> 59:09.680
Like he just left. He just boned out. Yeah. I guess it's what I'd do if I stabbed someone

59:10.560 --> 59:14.960
or didn't and everyone thought I did. Maybe he's, maybe he stole the space shuttle. He might have,

59:14.960 --> 59:18.960
it might have been him in the space shuttle. All right, stupid jury duty. We spent the whole

59:18.960 --> 59:23.600
night talking about jury duty. Uh, real quick, when I was sitting in the big, like when you sit

59:23.600 --> 59:26.320
up in the gallery out there and they're saying like, who has conflicts? Who has this? And you

59:26.320 --> 59:30.240
all write it down. You hope you get kicked out. And they're going to, I have a thing. I'm going

59:30.240 --> 59:35.680
out of town as a vacation. Yeah. When are you going? Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Stay. Oh, you,

59:35.680 --> 59:41.120
you can go. You have a, you're taking care of an elderly woman. You can leave. So people were

59:41.120 --> 59:46.080
going, some people were kind of on hold and she comes to me and I had all these improv show dates

59:46.080 --> 59:51.200
like traveling around doing improv comedy. I wrote them all down. I was already contracted to go.

59:51.200 --> 59:55.920
And so this judge and she was kind of this tough lady and she's like, all right, Jeff Davis says,

59:55.920 --> 59:58.960
you're going to be out of town through January this and that and that, then February, blah, blah,

59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.240
and that's, that's, that's about half of the dates and things. She's, what do you do? I go, I said,

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:10.480
do comedy shows. And she's like, what kind of comedy shows? Like improvisation. There's like

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.800
a hundred people in there who have interesting lines or, you know, mundane lines or whatever.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:19.280
And like, you heard a lot of, like a lot of very specific shit. This is, this is a new one. Yeah,

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.680
it's pretty amazing. I kept recording it because I was like, shit, I work like for hours coming up

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.880
with, you know, people are standing up like, like, like, weird, like, so specific, you can't write

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.320
it. And so she goes, and she goes, like, are you an actor? I go, yeah. And she goes,

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:41.440
are you going to be famous, Mr. Davis? And I said, yes, your honor.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.240
And she goes, get out of here. Get out of here. All right. All right. That's it. Good night,

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:59.520
folks. Before we bring Spencer up, Adam, we were not talking to you.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:05.600
All right. Adam, no, well, I asked Adam to bring his roommate here. Oh, okay. I'm sorry,

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.600
Adam. That was probably Adam has a weird relationship with his roommate that I want to

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:15.600
explore. Adam has a weird relationship with me. Adam is going to bring humanity up his roommate.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:22.960
And we're going to get to the bottom of why things are so uncomfortable between us in the

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:42.880
apartment called Earth. I was in the I was in the green room with with our friend that does not

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:50.320
exist. Documentarian Neil Berkeley. Yes. World famous. Why on the wall, he does not exist. He's

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:54.800
not making a movie about us going on tour. He does not exist. He's not a person that is going

01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:00.000
to be in the movie. So everything I say about it. But I wanted to talk like he was shooting me

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.360
and he asked questions. You know, he wants information. He's like, so what do you think?

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.400
What do you think you're going to do tonight or something? He's not that lame. I don't remember

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.880
what he's asking me. But I was going like, yeah, well, the thing is, we were doing this and I've

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.560
always thought that you should do this and I want to try this. And there was a point where he said,

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:26.080
maybe mischaracterizing it, but this is how I perceived it. He went like, so is this how you

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:34.160
really talk? Is this who you really are? Like he was kind of like he's like a documentarian who's

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.960
going like, wait a minute, what the fuck's going on? Are you are you always this retarded?

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:49.600
No, he didn't say that. I was like, is this how you talk? And I was like, I think so. I don't

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.240
know. I'm perfectly willing to accept that it's not. I don't know. There's a camera on me and

01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:02.560
I'm talking. And I was like, you know, you're very, very loquacious. That's all. I didn't want to

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:07.920
throw him into the bus. I wanted to talk about my anxieties that that causes. Right. What do you

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.280
do when someone asks you that? Is this how you really talk? I thought I couldn't tell what you

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.840
were going to say. Like he was making fun of a stammer or no, no, no, no, no. I think he meant like

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:25.120
I was always on. Who said that? Fuck you. I'm kidding. Not fuck you. Who said that though? Oh,

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:30.560
oh, Jesus said that. That's what I thought he meant. Jesus called out always on. That's what

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.960
I thought he meant. Like that's what I was like, I guess it's possible I may be overly conscious

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:40.320
of the camera. I am talking after all to a camera. So I'm probably not acting completely like I

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:47.440
normally would. So that's what I, but I was, it threw me and it made me wonder if I'm a human

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:53.120
being or not. Right. What was the verdict? I don't know. I don't have no idea. How am I supposed

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:57.040
to know? You think I mean, eventually we're going to be, that camera is going to be up your nose

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.360
for almost three weeks. Yeah, and I'll get used to it. Yeah. But I don't think that was his issue.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.680
He wasn't, he, because we talked about it. I was like, what the fuck? Because I'm self-obsessed.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:11.040
I'm like, what did you mean? Tell me everything. What did you mean? And he said, no, it's just,

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:14.640
you know, you're very, he said, loquacious, which is something my mom always used to call me.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:18.720
How did I segue out of Adam and his roommate? I just wanted to say, talk about it.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:24.160
Oh, okay. That was Adam. Fuck Adam. I was just saying before we bring Spencer up,

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.320
because it's 9.20. I just, I was just thinking of this thing that happened before the show.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.920
Yeah. Well, what, you know, what are you saying that I'm not normal? No, no. I think you're very

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:43.680
normal. I mean, I don't, I talk how I talk. It's not, so I'm just trying, I'm just trying to express

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:52.880
myself. And you do. I, which funny, but everybody, like, I'm nervous about the way I talk, because I

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:57.280
talk way too fast. I would love to talk slower. And when I listen to the podcast, I think you're

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:04.160
way more articulate than I am, because I'm talking at a mile a minute. Yeah. We, we both have our

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:08.160
little modulations of when we're talking well and talking poorly. Yeah. Tonight's a bad night for me,

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:15.040
but that's, that's beside the point. I disagree. I was just, I just, it made me wonder. Yeah. I've

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:22.240
just obsessed with myself and like, I was like, Oh, do I am I, what was I, it's not important.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.720
I think he's just a really good documentarian. He's got under your skin. Well, yeah. Is that what

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.560
they're supposed to do? He's going to break you down. He's going to turn you inside out like a

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:39.440
sock. He's really great. He's really great at that. Yeah. He's a powerful presence to have. I like,

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:43.280
I like, I like him. It's interesting because he's not just a guy with a camera. He's like,

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.800
he knows what he's doing. Like he's, he has opinions about something. He's up your ass.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.680
He doesn't, he's not going to, he's not, he gives no quarter to your ass.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:57.840
He raped you, didn't he? He touched me. He started touching me and I was like,

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.720
like, what are you doing? And he's like, no, did you get in the light? And he's like,

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:05.280
touching my cheek. And he kind of pushed it. It's like, you look beautiful that way.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:10.000
And I was like, I don't know. Is this, I think this is the documentary. This is Neil Berkeley,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.600
famous documentarian. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he doesn't, he's not shooting this thing. He's not a

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:18.720
character in it, but he was like, he's like, and then he's like, take your shirt off. And I was

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.000
crying. And I was like, do you understand I'm crying because you're doing this? And he's like,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.800
yeah, you're beautiful when you cry. And then out of nowhere, I said, I have no idea. Like,

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:35.040
he had a beach ball. Like, like, how do you fully inflate it, handed me a beach ball. I was just

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:39.440
like, no, no, no, no, play with it. Play with it. Like, what do you, what do you fuck her out at

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.560
the beach? Play with it. I, I, I, it was fucked up. I just wanted to talk to you about it because

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:50.240
I'll forget about it tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. But I mean, it was a pink camera with like no lens and

01:06:50.240 --> 01:07:05.840
like ridges. Damn, that's a dildo. Why is that too far? I don't know. You guys are customers

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:11.280
always right. Whatever you guys think is entertainment is up to you. But earlier, I will remind you that

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:16.480
I said I felt someone's poop by fucking them in the butt and you were, you acted like Dean Cooke

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:24.560
was out here. And that you were fans of Dean Cooke. Anyways, Spencer time, Spencer time.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.600
Spencer, our dungeon master, extraordinary.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:40.720
Saunter is towards his throne with a satchel. His satchel is unfurled with the power of a million

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:46.800
brimlocks. I like that you're rapper. You said that you were a level three mage. What was that?

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.800
Yeah, that was which we are. We leveled up or we leveled up. So can I talk to more than one

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.440
squirrel a day now, Spencer? No, that's racial. It doesn't go by a level.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:09.840
So Spencer, did you get off of work? Yeah, okay. I got, I got the 10th from the 31st off. So if

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:14.240
we're within those dates, I'm good. Otherwise, I might like have to dive out earlier. No,

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.280
10 of the 31st puts you right. Well, there you go. Thick of things.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.760
Spencer will be joining us on Harmon Channel tour.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:29.920
Justin Marshall, our podcast producer is going to endeavor to release our podcast daily. Right.

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.760
So that people might follow the. So you guys won't be left out. And then we're gonna try to

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:40.720
make a big party happen when we come back. So we're in on the 31st of January, we're in, we're

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.440
at sketch fest in San Francisco, which is our, no offense, Los Angeles, but you'll probably all

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:51.040
agree because you're from Los Angeles, our favorite city, San Francisco. We love it. And

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.080
we were going to be there for a sketch fest and do, do our final tour show there. But then

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.200
then we'll be back here in LA and we're going to try to put together like a big thing. We should

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:07.920
have a big like homecoming. At the Wiltern. Yeah, sure. I don't know. Whatever. We'll just stack

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:15.600
homeless people and make a, make a stage out of them and just walk all over them and just go,

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:26.480
it's good to be back. There were less of these in Montana. Squishy here.

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:33.840
But at any rate, I mean, I think we will talk about what we learned and what we, what we didn't

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:39.360
learn. Also, I mean, I don't imagine anybody would, but should anybody happen to see us at a gig

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.600
that that's here tonight or comes to our shows here, if we're out in the road, come in or dish

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.880
yourselves. It'd be nice to see you like if. Oh, absolutely. Of course. Nice to meet any like

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.600
traveling Armenians that come, come meet us. Speaking of, speaking of Armenians, I saw the

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.200
harm, the Armenian you the other day. I saw Armenian Dan Harmon. And I sing a whole song

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:04.880
about Armenian Harmon. Armenian Harmon. See you away from me. He looked an awful lot like you.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:10.560
And he was almost definitely Armenian. I can't imagine there's much of a line between me and

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:15.920
Armenian me. Like, I think I could pass pretty easily for Armenian men. It's, it's, it's a hair's

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:23.520
breadth. Yeah. Spencer, how you doing over there? I'm doing, doing pretty, pretty good. Yeah,

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.720
you look like it. Thanks. Thanks. I'm always happy to see you, Spencer. You're a welcome

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:35.360
addition here. It's good to have you. I'm glad to be enjoyed by you guys. Are you, are you ready

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:41.520
to be in a tour bus with us for God knows how long? Yeah. I don't usually do things and that sounds

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:47.840
like a thing. It's a, a tour bus is a great place to do it. This is almost certainly a thing. So

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.960
it's going to be very exciting for you. Yeah. It's a change of pace. In addition of things.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.160
You'll be, you'll be doing what you normally do at 70 extra miles per hour.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.200
Master baiting. Oh, the plot thickens.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:12.960
Yeah. Dress for movement, Spencer. That is going to be a thing, isn't it? We're going to be together

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:18.240
for, I didn't even thought about that. I know. Yeah. We're all going to be fucking sucking on that

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:24.720
trip. It doesn't take long. Yeah. I'm going to watch Oz. I'm going to wear your ass like a hat,

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:35.600
Spencer. I've seen, I've seen enough movies to know some, some shaws are going to get shanked.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.400
Oh, wait, what did Goldberg want? Goldberg brought his roommate, I feel. Can we just,

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:47.440
can we sneak him up real quick? Sure. If that were possible. Is that an oxymoron?

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:50.480
Can we sneak Adam Goldberg? Adam Goldberg, everyone. Welcome back, would you?

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:56.320
I'm measured applause for the return of Adam Goldberg. I asked you to bring your roommate.

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.600
And I asked you to bring back that plate I gave you last night. Do you have the plate?

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:05.440
Yeah, I don't. But in my, in my defense, it's a very passive aggressive move to hand someone a big

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:11.360
heavy plate full of baked goods and then ask for the plate back when they're nowhere near their

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:19.600
plate holding device. I actually gleefully left it like in a public restroom. I couldn't, I couldn't

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.640
wait for you to ask for it back. So I could explain to you your 24 year old ass. No, you don't do

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:28.320
that Adam. You don't hand someone a big heavy plate full of baked things unless you want to kiss

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.920
the plate goodbye. It is defense. You gleefully leave lots of things in public restrooms.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:40.960
But also not a valuable plate. I don't care. I should have taken a picture of it.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:49.680
A bunch of half eaten cookies and just like two brownies like upside down. That dessert trade

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:55.520
traveled over 80 miles by the time it got to you from beautiful Agora Hills, California.

01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:01.840
You're a diabolical person. I brought you snacks. That's a weird way to bring the diabolical into

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:08.720
it. It's not, but you didn't bring like a hot, like wonderful tray of home books things. You add

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:15.040
them. You're mad at me because I didn't bring you home cooked snacks. No, Adam. Talk to my roommate

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:28.880
who's a chef. Can we get a round of applause? Did you just throw to an audience intro?

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:38.880
All right. Adam Goldberg's roommate.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:51.520
He just walked out the back door. Adam's been given a terrible latitude in an apartment

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.360
town. I'm not sure I'm crazy about it. Adam Goldberg's roommate.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:01.520
I do have a name. But I just want to say from that title alone, everyone's already on your side.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.920
You're like Joan of Arc. Please welcome Hitler's therapist.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:26.320
What is your name? Anastasia. Anastasia. Ooh, prettiest name ever.

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:32.000
I've used that a lot. It's people's middle names like in comedy writing.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.280
Sarah Silverman's middle name and the Sarah Silverman program was Anastasia

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:40.240
and Pierce Hawthorne on community's middle name was Pierce Anastasia Hawthorne.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.400
Doesn't that mean something like resurrection or something like that?

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.160
You know, you're one of the first people to just point that out. It's true.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:51.760
Oh, I've read out of Karenena. What's the origin of Anastasia?

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:57.680
It's actually from two Greek words that mean resurrection. It's a pretty common

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.040
Greek and Russian name, just not here. I don't know why I keep looking at my

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:05.520
Dudges and Dragons character sheet. It says you have a bag of holding.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.480
We'll be right back. Not a good interviewer. I'm not good.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.320
If there's an edge of the pool within reach, I will grab it.

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:25.680
What's on your mind, Anastasia? What brings you up here? What brings you up on stage?

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:34.160
It seems to have disappeared. No, let's ask her. You have Adam Goldberg's roommate

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.080
on stage. What do we have a weird relationship with? I didn't know.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.720
Well, I just assumed. You know why I thought it was weird? Because you'd never been here

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:47.920
before and Adam is like a regular. That's an understatement. So you would never come here.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.880
So what's that about? That's not a judgment of us, right?

01:15:52.880 --> 01:16:01.360
No, no, I can't see you guys. No, it's not that. No, my schedule is fucked up. I'm a cook,

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:07.280
so I work when other people play, and this is usually an issue. I work on Fridays. I work

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:12.560
on Saturdays. Can we ask where you work? Yeah. We don't have to. If you don't want to say it.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:18.480
No, no, no, it's cool. I used to crow about it. I worked for Wolfgang Putt catering until about

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:26.960
a month ago, and I now work at the USC Radisson. There's an upscale sports bar there called McKay's.

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:31.760
Wait, USC, meaning University of Southern California? Yes, the USC Radisson.

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.600
Yes, they do many things well. I don't think they should be managing hotels.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:39.680
Yeah, it seems weird. That's a weird amalgam of higher education.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:42.720
Are you a cook or chef? Have you studied?

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:49.360
Technically, I'm a cook. You're not a chef unless you manage a staff.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:54.960
As a technically, chefs don't really do a whole lot of cooking as a result, but go on.

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.400
What's the weirdest thing you've ever caught Adam Goldberg wearing?

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.600
You should probably be asking me that question.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.200
All right, what's the weirdest thing you've been caught wearing by Adam Goldberg?

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:14.320
You brought it up on a staff list. I assume that's why I was here.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.000
No, you are here purely to embarrass Adam Goldberg, in my opinion.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.360
All right, that's a good story. No, what was it? Yeah, what?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.120
At the risk of, I don't know, I'm just starting to feel kind of naked right now,

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:36.320
so give me a moment. Do you want me to throw something?

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.280
I haven't ingested enough booze to be social right now.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.680
Pour a drink. Dan, give it up. Do you drink vodka? Do you want vodka?

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:49.680
Oh, sure. After today, I could use a drink.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.400
Today was fucked up. You haven't been here to the show before, but I put a sharpie pen up my butt

01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:04.880
once. And not recently, I'm getting your ice, but I just mean the bar is low as far as human

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.200
dignity. You don't need to... Yeah, don't stick your finger in that cup. I'm good.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:14.400
Oh, because you're a cook, you know. I'm in the red zone with my bacteria.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:21.120
I can get you a fresh cup and... It's cool. I've seen her. I've dealt with her story, but...

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:25.120
Here's your ice cup. Thank you.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:38.560
Spencer... Wow. Dan Porter is seven ounces of vodka over my finger.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:46.080
All right, but there must be an embarrassing thing I could tell you to put you at ease.

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:50.800
Okay, it's not really embarrassing, at least not to me, but it was probably so for Adam.

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:59.280
Anyway, I'm kind of hesitant to call this a kink. It's not really a kink. It's not really a fetish.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:07.840
This is no one. Because I don't get off on it. That's the thing. But... But I may.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.240
I can't believe you don't come here every week. This is your home. This is where you belong.

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:24.560
I'm starting to feel that way now. I'm glad. Okay, so I've been into... I can show you...

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:29.120
Well, okay, Zen Tai for a while. Some of you might already know what that is.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:37.920
Zen Tai? Zen Tai. Yes. Is that related to Hen Tai? No, it's not. There are a lot of

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:46.880
sound-alike words in Japanese. This is... I'll say. Clean up your act, Asians. You've been warned.

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:52.640
I'm like, are you actually pointing at any? I may be. Who knows? Can't throw a cat without

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:59.280
hitting one on this side of town. Misha, you here? Misha? Hey, Misha. Oh, should I miss Misha?

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:06.080
Anyways, what is it? What is it? All right, so they're basically head-to-toe spandex suits.

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:13.120
Oh, okay. Well, that's a cousin of... You want to come on the Harmontown Tour too?

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:19.280
If I could get off work for long enough, I would love to. That's the thing. I can't. I'm like...

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.880
Whenever they're paying, we'll double it. What's up? Whenever they're paying you, we'll double it.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.720
I might have to take you up on that offer. Okay, I didn't think it was going to go that well.

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:35.200
I'm like, I work in a restaurant where they're trying to make magic with seven people.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:40.640
Now, when you put on these little spandex suits, do you go about town? Do you wander around on the

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:47.040
hunt? Yeah, I do. Wait, under your clothes? Or just... You mean like... Not... Well, yeah,

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:51.360
I'm wearing clothes over them. Okay, so that's your little secret. You've got a little sexy

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.400
spandexy outfit on. It's not really a secret if your head is covered. Yeah, it's over your face.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.480
Yes. So do you rob banks?

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:10.000
No, actually. Well, you go out of the house in a full spandex head-to-toe suit. I do.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:17.760
And just go, just hit cookaroo and just walk around. Just because I feel like it. Oh, yeah,

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:21.680
cool. Just go about your business. Pretty much. That's awesome. And what's the reaction to people

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:27.680
that you're running to? Strangely enough, as long as I don't make a huge deal about it,

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:34.400
no one else does either. There are occasionally, like, I don't know, there is occasionally genuine

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:46.880
alarm, like... Ninja! Ninja! Like, I remember ordering, like, a couple weeks ago, I ordered a

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:52.080
pumpkin spice latte from the Starbucks, the Tarzan. So you go, it's not just a stroller on the

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:57.520
block. Are you wearing anything else? Are you wearing anything else but just the head-to-toe

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:02.400
spandex? Well, this is a mesh suit, so I have to wear shit under it. I mean, over it. It's mesh.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:07.760
Yes. Okay, so you got some, you got some knickers underneath it. Something.

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.840
Fill me in here, Anastasia. This is new. I'm not, okay. Okay, so you dressed up like... I mentioned

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:20.240
that. I mean, I was like, I'm not going there, but... So you went to Starbucks and... Yeah,

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.720
I'm not interested. I got some serious Googling to do tonight.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:32.160
But I wear clothes over it, so I'm not like... It's A-N-A-S-T-A... Well, yeah, what is it really?

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:36.080
I wouldn't know what it's called, because the amazing thing about that, I love that the internet,

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:44.320
like, like, it, like, you encounter people now, you get to go. There's gonna be, like, 500 people

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:51.120
that listen to you, and 40 of them are gonna go, wait, me too! And like, how do I, like,

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:57.760
there's a thing? There's a subreddit? So what? Yeah, I would be surprised. What's the, what's the,

01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:04.880
would you say it's called? Zentai. And it's, look at the Z? Yes. And you're saying it's not a,

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:09.040
necessarily a sexual thing for you. Not for me. It seems to be for a little bit. It's kind of like,

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:14.400
like, comfort, like, like, maybe like a... More or less. What's the, what's the, what's the fulfillment

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:22.960
of that for you? Like, what is that? What itch does that scratch? You put it out. It's basically a,

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:28.640
it's either a meditative thing for me, or it's, I used to call them hug suits, because I'm like,

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:34.080
if I'm feeling like shit, I don't know, just... Right. Feeling tightly enclosed. Like, enclosed,

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.920
yeah. There's a thing, I have a big nylon fetish. I like, I, you haven't been here. Welcome aboard.

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:46.000
So you're familiar with encasement? Yes, encasement, yes. Sorry, did I call it?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.720
It's related. Yes, it's like, like, if you take... Spencer, take five.

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.560
If you, if you, if you take, if you take nylon...

01:23:52.560 --> 01:24:07.440
If you, if you take nylon fetishry to, to, yeah, it's like, like, you, like, like, yeah, there's people,

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.240
like, you, there's people who want the whole body encased in it. And I remember when I was a kid,

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:18.240
when I was watching Batman, and I'm pretty convinced that Yvonne Craig, who played the

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.240
bad girl on the Adam West Batman series, I'm pretty sure she has everything to do with everything

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:28.480
for me. Because she had this red wig, and she, she was like, she looked good. And, and, and

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:34.640
everyone on that show was wearing a nylon something or spandex something. And there was also a lot of

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:42.400
like, like, oh, Batman, I've tied you to Robin and Batgirl again. Like, I'm gonna put you in

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.120
this sausage machine, and you're gonna have to, I bet you'll never get out. And no matter how hard

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:54.000
you wriggle, and like, I remember being a really little kid and like, watching Batman, and like,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.400
like, putting myself in between a bunch of pillows and like, like, like, kind of like, like, like,

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:03.360
wriggling around and like, feeling the comfort. And then I saw that Temple Grandin movie on HBO,

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:11.840
where she, she made herself a squeeze machine. Oh, dude, that Temple Grandin movie is fucking

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:18.080
badass. Like, it's amazing. You got everyone asked to see it. It's the most amazing thing I've

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:28.560
ever seen in my life. Period. Not as good as Batman Rising. So Batman, there's a new squeeze machine.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:38.240
I was wondering what it would break first, your spirit, or your body.

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:46.640
All right, sorry. So have we cured you of Zentai yet, Anastasia? No. But like, the, the, the idea

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:52.640
of like, like, tight, like, yeah. Yeah. And I, there's, I think there's like, people who like,

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.120
oh, I like to wear tube socks, like, like really tight, like people, like, like, I want things

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:03.520
squeezing me and putting pressure on me, like, like, like, relaxes you. It's weird, but it does.

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:09.040
I think my, I mean, I'm not, I'm not saying it's to be glib or, or, or right, but I feel like suits

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:12.960
for me, there's a kind of an encasement kind of thing. Like, I love the feeling of being wrapped

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.960
up in a suit. It's like pajamas, and it's like, it's kind of like armor in a way. I feel very safe

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:24.000
and secure in a suit. Well, we fit you pretty well, actually. Don't take that the wrong way.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:31.440
All right. Well, my pants just leveled up. Trying to make Spencer back in on this matter.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:38.320
All right. I'm told I have that effect. What is it? What is it? What does Adam eat by default?

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:43.840
Like, what's, what's on his side of the fridge? Yeah. Like, no, no, what's on the coffee table?

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.720
Like, like, like, like just empty blank wrappers. What, like, like, what does he always just eat?

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:56.080
Oh, God. I can't even answer this one of only because it's wood.

01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:03.920
And you're, you're afraid he'll be outed as like some kind of no, no. Nothing but neighbors.

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:08.640
This is like, I mean, that's how we got Adam Goldberg's roommate up here. And I don't know.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.760
I don't know. She's being very good. She's being more soft revelatory than, than Adam.

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.720
No, that's great. It's very noble of you. But, but also I want, like, what, what does he do?

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:21.280
There's got to be one thing. What can we do? That's never going to happen.

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:29.920
Should I bring Eric Eitel over? And no, I, I just want, we want to tease him about one thing,

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:35.120
like, like one specific thing. Does he have like a porcelain bulldog that sits on his desk?

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.560
Hey, Skyfall, take it easy.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.320
Is he like, what does he, what does he watch? What's his favorite?

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:46.800
I'm actually the weirder one here. I, I'm just, that's almost impossible.

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:55.600
I mean, I'm, I'm, for God's sake, I'm a cook and I hardly ever cook. So whatever food is in the

01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:02.320
fridge is usually his. Um, he eats at this point, he eats a much more varied diet than I do. I'm

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.880
like, I subsist on whatever leftovers I can get from the restaurant, despite being able to afford

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:14.160
more than that. I just don't have time. Goldberg continues to elude us. He's normal. Oh my God.

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:18.640
We're going to get you. He's not normal. We're going to bring his mother up next week and she's

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.840
going to be like, I don't know. I felt something down there. And then it was just, I heard a

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:30.720
skateboard and he was gone. God damn it. I want to deal with, is he, is he Soviet? What is,

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:37.680
what does he want from us? Uh, all right. Well, anything, anything, I don't know what to say.

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.160
This, anything you want to plug while you're up here? You get to, you get to, you've been very

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:47.520
gracious and very revelatory. Anything you want to say to America, not America, that was,

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:50.800
that's presumptuous. Anything you want to say to the thousand people who was on the show?

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:52.640
350.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:59.120
That would have been my college radio DJ days. Tell your dad, you're sorry I didn't call him

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:05.760
on Father's Day or anything. Oh God. Um, God, I'm,

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:12.480
I put you on the spot. I do. I'm a bad interviewer. No, hardly. It's just, I,

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.200
it's something I don't really have an answer to. I'm like, anything I want America to know.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.800
I mean, if you had needs, you couldn't live with Adam Goldberg.

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:31.360
What was mean? I go, I go where the, I go where the, you know, the pellet gives me the honey,

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.560
you know? I find that making fun of Adam gets me laughs. So do you, do you owe him money?

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:40.080
Does he have something on you? Is there some sort of weird blackmail thing going on right now?

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:44.160
Besides what I told you about, now everyone else knows about, not really.

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.920
And Starbucks, you just wanted to Starbucks. You don't care. No, no, not, not just Starbucks,

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:52.800
Harvard. Have you and Adam, have you and Adam ever made up? No.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:00.080
Will they? Oh, I know you were entertaining thoughts at one point.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:05.680
Yeah. Oh, here we go. Does he, does he, does he play video games? Does he?

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:09.920
Yeah, but how is that strange? I'm like, no, I just want to, in details,

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:14.000
does he throw knives at a board? Like, like, he's home all day.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.240
I'm like the perfect roommate because I'm never home.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.640
All right. Well, thanks, thanks, Adam. That was, that was fascinating.

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:26.080
Anastasia. Anastasia. Anastasia.

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:34.160
Thank you so much for coming up and, and bearing your humanity to us and resurrecting

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:39.760
Adam's character on this show. Once again. Yeah. Once you have, I said, okay,

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:43.840
God damn it, we really fucked up. We went too long. It's too late. No problem.

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:50.160
All right, Spencer. Spencer. All right, Spencer. Dungeons and Dragons, speed round. Time for a

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.400
Dungeons and Dragons. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quicky.

01:30:54.400 --> 01:31:01.920
It's a special segment where we play Dungeons and Dragons in 10 minutes and get the fuck out of

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:07.360
here. Sorry. Dungeons and Dragons introduction segment. After tussling with a gelatinous cube

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:14.160
in a pit. No, our heroes came upon a horrendous scene. A vicious barbarian raid on the White

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:20.240
Skull Knoll village. It was here that Sharpie's father, Lord Mango Buttsalot, revealed himself,

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:26.480
hurtling headlong at the party. Swords and spells flew as the forces clashed. But when the dust

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:31.680
settled, the barbarian Lord lies sleeping on the floor, suffering from a face full of magic.

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:37.040
There our adventurers stand in the wreckage of the White Skull Camp as dawn breaks on the

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:42.400
grassy hills of the Butz Peninsula. So if you recall, you're standing in the wreckage of this

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:47.200
Knoll village, right? And he like, you knocked him out. Yeah, you're like going to draw a

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:53.200
violent head or something. And we took him out systematically. And now he's sleeping it off.

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:56.080
And you're figuring you were you're thinking about taking his anchor.

01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:03.600
I remember. And we love he was wielding an anchor, which is awesome. Go. Speed round.

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:09.200
Level three. Yeah, I got a new thing called power attack. I'm excited about that.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.240
Power attack. I didn't say I want a power attack.

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:18.880
Are you describing power attack? I would have if you didn't stop me.

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:25.120
I thought just by mentioning I was going to kill the Sharpie Buttsalot by accident.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.440
Please tell me. No, it's fine. The moment's gone. We'll come back to it. Oh, shit.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:36.960
As Lord Buttsalot sleeps on the floor, you notice several barbarian warriors suddenly creep out of

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:46.400
hiding. Oh, shit. Power attack. They seem weary. Oh, wait. McGathey's Friman, Friman Summonen's

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:54.800
cinnamon must say cinnamon mustache. Sorry, Aaron. Can you can you can you can you play your character?

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:58.400
Speed come up. I'm sorry. I am the guy.

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:06.800
McGathey, everybody. As Malorean Sedona, which Vace Panos tells me, Sedona is Armenian for Satan.

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:14.640
I love cinnamon mustache. All right, sorry, sorry. So is that where somebody shits in your chest?

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:21.760
There's barbarians coming out of the out of the bushes. They seem weary and relieved.

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:31.600
They approach you calling out. Hey, hey. Hey, easy with the magic. Hey, man, only using as much as I

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.800
have to. Thanks for knocking out our war chief. He gets kind of crazy, you know, when he's raging.

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.120
Hey, listen, how's it going? How's it going? You should have been to dinner on Tuesday nights.

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:47.840
I'm his son. Sharpie, Sharpie Buttsalot. Sharpie Buttsalot. Nice to meet you. I am

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.080
live by Leonard. We've actually met before. Oh, right. Yeah, just an ages past. Well, I was a little drunk.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:59.360
Well, so you guys. Yeah. I'm talking to the barbarians.

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.080
So you're you're you're I came to I came to stop you because you're headed for the

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:14.960
you're headed to talk to the dwarves, right? No, see, that was just a clever ruse to throw them

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:18.480
off our trail. We really came here to this no village to wipe it out.

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:27.280
Yeah, the plot thickens. Damn, I can't keep up with this shit. And I also have to confess,

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:35.280
I've never single thing on any of these. Never ever. Like sometimes we're up against the wall

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:47.520
and I'll go like a snake handler. And I get lucky. But we're level three now. So I'm gonna try to

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:50.960
but these are these are ostensibly people who were on their side because this is these

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.120
these are friends of your sleeping father, right? These are my peeps. Yeah, those are your peeps

01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:02.960
ostensibly ostensibly. I asked these barbarians as a barbarian myself. I greet them with my

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:09.680
with with the old barbarian handshake. All right. For the podcast listeners, Jeff is giving a very

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:14.880
elaborate handshake, right? For the package, specifically, you you the first person on the

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.840
left holds their hands together as if in prayer. The other person does the same and holds their

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:27.600
hands 90 degrees, right? And they they bisect each other's fingers, and then look through each other's

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:38.960
hands and chuckle. It's a goodie. Yes, yes, we did expect you. You see, Yerch, he was here before

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:51.120
he told us you'd be coming. Aha. Well, we're here. Again, thank you for killing or not killing our

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:56.800
barbarian Lord. Please don't loot his body. It's important to us. So hey, it couldn't be more

01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:05.200
important to me. I mean, he came me. Now, when he wakes, when he wakes up, is that what do we how

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:09.040
do we get him on our side? Will he wake up in a better mood? Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was raging,

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.360
you know, he was drunk. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was drunk. I'm trying to wrap my mind around and I'm

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:23.120
so sorry. I ask questions. It's fine. You guys weren't headed towards any dwarves at all. No,

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:28.320
you see, the dwarves are our enemies, but that was not the intention of this mission. Oh, that's

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.160
what you told everyone you were going to go do, and then you're going to go on a secret assassination

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:35.840
mission. We were really looking for something. Well, what's going down with the dwarves? I'm

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:41.280
distressed by all this talk. I mean, forever, human and dwarf have been inextricably bound

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:51.120
by humanoidness. I have no problems with dwarves per se, but the Hammerbeard tribe themselves,

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:56.640
they're very warlike. They're martial. They're not normal dwarves. They've been trying to overtake

01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:04.000
these planes for years. You said they're bad dwarves. Yeah, I'd say so. Take your word for it.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.880
You said you were here to find something. What were you specifically here to find? You see,

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:14.000
that's actually classified. I think only Mango knows. Let's wake him up. Yeah, you want to wake

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.120
him up? I grabbed some water from a nearby well and splashed it on his face. You splashed it on his

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:28.320
face. He wakes up with a start. What? Sharpie, sharpie, it's you. What are you doing here?

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:43.120
I... Happy Father's Day. I want my cake. What if I'm... What are you doing here? I came to visit

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:48.320
you. I was out in the field and I was trying to work up my mage powers and I had an epiphany that

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:54.000
I should come in a tone with you. Finally come to take a run at your old man, hey? That's very brave.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.120
No, brah. No. Dad, I'm not going to take a run at you. You're a barbarian. I just wanted to be

01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:11.440
a wizard. Like, I came to take a run at your feelings. Your words strike a chord and his

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:21.200
face softens. He says, you know, back when I used to beat you. It was because I thought magic would

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:32.400
make you weak. But now I realize magic is strength. Magic is the universe. I shunned magic. But now

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:39.280
I realize magic is power. It binds my tribe and crushes my enemies underfoot. And that's why I've

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.920
been pursuing these fragments. Perhaps you've heard of them. They're called the Fragments of Power.

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:50.720
Don't we have one of those fragments? I whisper to Sharpie.

01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:05.840
It's kind of an Abbott and Costello kind of... I think we have two of them. Dad, I think we have

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:11.200
two of them. You think? Fragments. Well, we had one and then... Don't lie to your father, Sharpie.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:20.320
Well, I just can't keep track. Dad, I'm an alcoholic. And often our adventures occur

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:27.040
late in the evening when I've crossed a threshold. We'll show them to me. I pull out my dick and

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:36.640
balls. And then I say, just kidding. Not those fragments. We had two fragments, right? We had

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.080
the one that we got from the... The one that you had and the one you stole from Darkstar, yeah.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:48.960
Yeah. I pull them out. You whip them out. He inspects the dazzling crystals. He says,

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:53.680
yes, yes, these will do nicely. And he takes them from you. Well, what dad? Do you want to...

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:57.200
Okay, I'm sorry. He attempts to take them from you. And I go, ah, whoa.

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:04.480
You were just... He just rolled the dice? You're much quicker than him and pull the

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:09.280
the stones back. His face contorts with rage. I jump in front of Sharpie and say,

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.640
listen, we just met you and I know you're his father, but if you want what we've fought so

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:20.800
hard to gain, we will exact a price for them. Jesus. He looks at you with a new understanding

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:26.080
and then you see behind him approaching. Yerch, the gnoll. He's slinking up. He's holding a haunch

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:33.120
of meat and he's munching on it. A haunch of what? Of meat. A haunch of... I ask him if he likes his

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:41.520
what is eating. Yes, yes, he does. On closer inspection, you realize it's the leg of a gnoll.

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:48.400
Oh, I take an arrow and I shoot it at his shoe, so it just hits the shoe into the ground,

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:56.080
but not his foot. The severed foot or his personal foot, the one he owned. His personal foot,

01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:01.360
but I don't hurt him. I just keep him. Like a bug that I'm tax-curing. Ben,

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:06.800
sir, did you give me a power attack to use on Mulrainee Sidhanna? Because I'm fucking this close.

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:12.800
You guys make the action, I mean. Okay, so you shoot at his foot, at his foot, or near his foot.

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:20.320
Just to keep him. It seems like the right thing to do. Well, it does miss. He looks at you with

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:25.520
anger. He approaches mango without you guys talking. He approaches mango and they turn

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:28.880
their backs to you and whisper to one another. You see him pull something out of his pocket.

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:32.880
It looks kind of like your crystal, but it's a deep blood red. He hands it to him.

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:40.560
Dad, listen, you said that you have a newfound respect for magic, so I would hope that that

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:46.880
would be a entree into a newfound respect for your son's vocation and a newfound respect for

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:52.400
the potential destruction that magic can cause. These two shards that we've uncovered,

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:58.320
you know, we got them from shitty people who were corrupted by their power and, you know,

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.440
we just need to make sure, I'm all four gathering all of them, to keep them out of the hands of

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:12.560
the shitty. So let's not get all grabby. He seems a bit calmed by your speech, you know. You always

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:17.840
had a way to convince him sometimes. What happens if you combine all these shards together? What

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:24.000
is the force that that creates? You see the fragments of power about fragments of the tapestry

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:32.720
of fate. You can imagine the universe as the reflection of the light. That light is magic.

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:37.760
The light comes through the tapestry of fate and projects our reality. But these

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:43.040
forge, they determine what the reality is. With the fragments in hand, one can determine

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:48.160
whatever reality they wish and will it into being. We can change the tapestry with the

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:54.640
shards? With the fragments of power, you are the tapestry. Now do we have three of the four or

01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.960
all four now? You guys personally have two. One of them's the one you found and one of them's a

01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:04.160
pretty large one that you purified from the Admiral Darkstar. You saw that red one, maybe.

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.480
So that's probably number three. Yeah, he might have other ones he hasn't told you about. I'll

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:14.320
carry it because I'm very strong. Which one? The large one. You'd have to ask Sharpie for that.

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:20.880
He owns it right now. You can carry it. I was just trying to help. Yeah, that's fine. I say that we

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:25.520
combine these three. Look Sharpie, I pull Sharpie and Mulrainee aside and say like, here's the deal.

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:28.560
We don't know what's going to happen when all four of these are together and who's going to control

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:33.680
them. But I say at least let's make sure that we as good people are involved when the four are

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:38.240
united and we can cross that bridge and we come to it. Let's unite these three and then go after

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:45.440
the fourth one together. Right, but first we've got to purify this red one. Dad, your crystal,

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:53.040
your shards, red. I don't think it's supposed to be. What do you know of these stones? Have you

01:43:53.040 --> 01:44:00.960
studied them? Well, I've got some hands on experience. I've taken two of them and I think

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:09.200
I purified one of them. I was, again, very drunk. I'm not coming to you as a proud man, Dad. I'm

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:16.160
coming to you as a guy with two shards and I'm saying yours is red and I think that when there

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:27.760
are different colors they should be purified. None of you. Take it easy. If I've learned

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:36.000
one thing on this adventure, different colors should be purified. Can I try to purify your red

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:44.800
crystal, Dad? I don't know what this purification process might do. Do you know what this is?

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:49.600
Well, it ain't going to make them less magical. Do you know that? Yes.

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:59.520
You say reasonably unconvincingly. Oh, you convince them.

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:03.920
Okay.

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:11.920
I thought it was climatic and unclimatic at the same time. Oh, yeah, you fucking nailed it.

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:19.040
But you know, you fucking did it. That's how it goes. He hands you the red crystal. Did I

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:24.080
purify the last one? Yeah, but you don't know what that means. I mean, you haven't like done

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:29.920
tests on an unpurified versus a purified. Yeah, but I can't, what did I do last time to remember

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.840
when we got you touched them together and one of them turned from like dark colored to like bright

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:40.480
dad. Oh, okay. That's really all you know. I turned my back and I go home. I just put the three

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:48.960
together. Is that from Temple of Doom? No, it's from gibberish. Okay. You notice the red one

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:56.240
glows and it actually turns the larger one red. Oh, let's just hope that red is good.

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:59.680
Let's commit to this. Maybe red's good.

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:09.280
Doesn't sound good. May I use Alchemist's fire to examine the color of the stones?

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:14.080
Alchemist's fire is a magical bag containing reagents that when exposed to air burst into

01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:19.920
flame. It's essentially an ascendiary device. All right, sorry. Why don't you shoot more arrows

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:26.400
at people's feet? Why did you do that? Did you think he was going to eat a chicken leg?

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:32.320
She just knows she has arrows and she keeps shooting them all the time with people.

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:35.280
No, I thought he was going to run away, so I just wanted to keep him still.

01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:40.320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Adventure.

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:48.160
Sure, don't tell. Mango calls. What's good? What's going on? You took my thing.

01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:54.880
I was just doing a thing. So what happened? The red one turned another one red?

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:59.120
Yeah. So we have one purified one and two red ones? Yes. So I think it's probably dangerous

01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:03.680
to combine all three of these together. It might very well be. I said we find the fourth one and

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:10.480
maybe there might very well be more than four. Can I rate Ranger for the fourth one? Ranger.

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:20.400
Here. You range unsuccessfully. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm sorry.

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.720
I throw one of my seven knives at the moon.

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.480
It can't hurt to try.

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:42.240
All right. Dad. What would you think about taking these things to someone that would

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:50.800
know better than us what their potential dangers are? You want to know what their potential dangers

01:47:50.800 --> 01:48:03.280
are? Check this out. He grabs his red crystal from your hand and he swallows it. Nothing happens.

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:14.240
Nothing. Nothing happens. This is true power. All right. Swallow your red one. This is why I

01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:27.680
left home. I never said he was sane. He might be crazy. Dad, is that the first time you've

01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:34.400
ever done that? No, no. This is my third. You've swallowed the second one's the hardest. Oh,

01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:39.840
so he's got one more inside him already. He's two more. Two more. He's the third one he swallowed.

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:47.040
So, okay. So, Dad, what can you do having swallowed this? Soon. Soon you'll see.

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.840
Are we supposed to cut him open and get those things? That's a lot. How much do you

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:56.320
pair? He presents his belly. He presents his belly. That's a joke. I could use,

01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:01.760
could I use my arrow to do surgery that's painless and then? Yeah, yeah, you're totally. That's,

01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:09.520
what's your surgery rating? That's heel skill. Heel skill? I think you're like a

01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:18.320
plus nine to heal. Dad, I'm really taken aback by your behavior. I'm not surprised. You know nothing

01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:22.640
of the fragments. You know nothing of the tapestry. You know nothing of true magic. Can we get the

01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:26.960
fellowship of the nerds up here to help us out and tell us what to do? Yeah, I know. I know a

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:31.920
corruptive magic when I see it. So, but he's not trying to go for my fragments, right? I thought

01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:39.280
I might too. Not yet. Although he does occasionally eye them. Yes. I've seen this before. Swallow

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.520
yours too and then it'll be as equal. It'll be like a toning with them. No, I'll just have two

01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:50.000
fucking unused fragments and like, he'll kill me. I don't know what to do. This seems like a great.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.880
Oh, he said detect magic. Detect a magic. You have two stones, one that's purified and one that's

01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:02.320
not purified. So why don't you detect magic and see which is stronger?

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:14.000
It's a luan that she uses. What does detect magic detect? Detect magic allows you to see

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.800
auras emanating out of things that are magical. As you focus harder, those auras become more

01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:24.480
distinct and determine the nature of such magic. Can I tell something that's more magical from

01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:30.560
something that's less magical? Yes. Okay. Because this guy's a hero. Listen to that guy. I will

01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:41.200
detect, cast Detect Magic on my dead stomach and on the shards in my hands. You sense several auras

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:48.320
of magic. One's coming from the stone in your hand. One's coming from the larger stone that's

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:56.080
been turned red now. A huge auras emanating out of Lord Buttsalot and a sizable auras emanating from

01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:09.280
Jeff's pocket. Well, that we knew about. You know what I'm saying about a gnome with a big sword.

01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:16.080
You notice Lord Buttsalot is emanating a magic of intense chaos and anger and power.

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:20.240
Well, I have magic too. Yeah, you can't see it though, Sue. I mean,

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:22.800
unless he says something to you, you have no idea this is happening.

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:31.840
All right. I'm going into the panic mode. So what's next, Dad? Where were you headed next?

01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:37.920
We take this fight to the dwarves. You see, the dwarves have fragments too. They want ours. We

01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:42.560
need to wipe them out before they finish their war plans and decimate my lands.

01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:48.960
Where do you think they are? The dwarves, the mountains that they live in. You see, they're

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:57.280
using dwarves like mountains. Yeah, no, I know they do. Do I know that I have an emanating

01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:06.720
thing? Okay, sorry, sorry, Jeff. Uh, uh, shit. Well, I mean, we were the shows way too late.

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:13.600
We're missing a piece. Uh, what? There are pieces in existence. You have a few of them.

01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:17.440
So right now are we trying to are we trying to find a missing piece or we're trying to

01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:20.720
figure out what's happening? You're talking to your dad or you're talking to his dad.

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:24.480
He seems to want to get the ones from the dwarves or maybe just kill the dwarves.

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:28.160
Let's unite forces and kill the dwarves and combine these shards together.

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:37.920
Yes, a barbarian after my own heart. Two arrows. Two arrows at the dwarves. Two arrows well

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:45.760
served. Wait, is she just trying to kill me? No, no, no, at the dwarves. Oh, you keep shooting

01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:51.280
arrows at everything. You just said kill the dwarves and I, yes, Anna do and said, yeah,

01:52:51.280 --> 01:53:00.880
let's kill the dwarves. Okay. How do I please you? It's a very good question. How many arrows?

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:07.520
Hi. Okay. All right. I just once bitten twice shy. We've never gone this late. We have to find a

01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:14.640
place to stop the show, but it's, I say that you make a big proclamation to, to me, to Mulraine,

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:21.760
and to your, to Lord Buttsalot about what, about like, just like Peter Jackson's breaking up the

01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:27.600
hobbit and to Shariax, I say you find a way to end this non act break in a great flourish

01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:31.920
in a way that you would end, you would break up the hobbit into one third.

01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:37.280
Right. And then as I recall from the Lord of the Rings, the thing that one character did was,

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:43.440
did you ever notice when it seems like a story is bad that it actually turns out it's good?

01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:47.920
Because there'll be another story. And then the other guy was like, yeah, I guess you're right.

01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:53.840
And then they ended the movie. That was how the, but we can't do that here. More craftsmanship.

01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:54.960
I just did it. It didn't work.

01:53:54.960 --> 01:54:14.240
We want to thank Spencer all for being up here. Thank you, Spencer. Yeah, come on.

01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:20.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Erin McAfee, Mulraine Sedona, thank you for being here.

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:28.160
Crystal Shards. Crystal Shards got power. Power going down to the hour. Got a fragment of this,

01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:34.400
got a fragment of that. Fuck your mama's dog. Fuck your mama's cat. Fuck your mama in a known

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:39.520
village. Fuck your mama in a pussy-eyed pillage. Fuck your mama with an axe. Fuck your mama with

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:44.960
a hammer. Fuck your mama and made her start to stammer. She was like, oh, that's good.

01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:51.600
