{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:15.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Harmontown is once again in session.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:20.000\nOh, yes.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:29.000\nWould you please be so kind as to bow down and worship the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:39.000\nYo, yo, yo, hip to the hop, got the best rap, ever got the best rap\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:44.000\nGot the best rap, ever gonna, best rap gonna rap, best ever gonna rap\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:49.000\nTo the best, gonna best rap ever got the well, start to rap now\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:52.000\nGonna, gonna, gonna, gonna start the rap now\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:56.000\nGonna rap about this, gonna rap rap that, gonna rap town\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:10.840\nI was trying really hard. I was just explaining to the cameras in the green room. I was like,\n\n01:10.840 --> 01:16.960\nokay, I got nothing. I'm not gonna say fuck your mama. I want to scrape my brain like\n\n01:16.960 --> 01:23.800\ndry toast and just like, yeah, well, it didn't happen. Just wrapped about rapping better.\n\n01:23.800 --> 01:26.800\nBut that's a good first step. Like they say, if you want to quit drinking first step is\n\n01:26.800 --> 01:31.640\nto go, I drink too much. Was it the beat? So I'm saying right now, I rap a lot about\n\n01:31.640 --> 01:36.760\nfucking your mama. Maybe next week it'll change. Do you think there were... No, that\n\n01:36.760 --> 01:40.240\nbeat was badass. You know, you liked that one. I was like... No, that one was really\n\n01:40.240 --> 01:46.480\ngood. Yeah. I really liked it. Was there like a banjo in there? I don't know if there was\n\n01:46.480 --> 01:54.920\na banjo. I felt like I kept picturing Kermit the Frog on a log, like fucking... Kermit,\n\n01:54.920 --> 02:03.120\nyeah, I catch the flies, I'm in a swamp now, gonna mump and fries. I can't do it. I'm thinking\n\n02:03.120 --> 02:08.520\ntoo much about fucking people's mamas and like, I won't be able to do it. Let's not\n\n02:08.520 --> 02:21.360\nstart the show cataloging my inadequacies. Let's talk about Christmas. Santa Claus is\n\n02:21.360 --> 02:28.200\nhere tonight. We got gay Santa Claus in the house. Look over here, you see a very tired\n\n02:28.200 --> 02:38.600\nCupid. I thought it would never end. Wait, no, that comes after Christmas. You mean Cupid\n\n02:38.600 --> 02:46.040\nfrom Valentine's Day or Cupid the Rain? Yeah, I was further confusing. I meant from Valentine's\n\n02:46.040 --> 02:55.940\nDay. Just edit it all out. This will probably be our Christmas show because we're like seven\n\n02:55.940 --> 03:03.240\nweeks behind in terms of when we record and when we broadcast. I don't listen to him.\n\n03:03.240 --> 03:09.120\nThe master does his work and then steps away from it. It's nice. The Dowdy Jing. It seems\n\n03:09.120 --> 03:22.880\nlike a bigger crowd tonight. Maybe it's because Chevy Chase is not a kid. That was mean. That\n\n03:22.880 --> 03:28.080\nwas just mean. I told you guys he called back and he wanted to do it, but he couldn't do\n\n03:28.080 --> 03:31.640\nit. Did you call him today? You said you're going to call him. I texted him. He couldn't\n\n03:31.640 --> 03:37.440\ndo it. I also, hey, while we're at it, I also texted Bob Odenkirk. Okay, also cannot do\n\n03:37.440 --> 03:55.400\nit. Yeah. Also, Sid Caesar couldn't make it tonight. But hey, I fucked your mama. I got\n\n03:55.400 --> 04:07.960\na new dance. It's not just side to side. Now you got a front to back little kicky thing.\n\n04:07.960 --> 04:15.680\nIt's the, I'm afraid to look at the audience dance. I think I might have, here's the thing,\n\n04:15.680 --> 04:27.520\nI rarely do this, but I over or underestimated. I ordered too many drinks. I didn't calculate\n\n04:27.520 --> 04:35.160\nit right. So if I were a pilot and this were an airline, you should get off the plane. But\n\n04:35.160 --> 04:39.240\nyou only paid $10. I promise I will try not to make it awkward. I didn't drink more than\n\n04:39.240 --> 04:42.240\nyou would normally drink. You just did it too quickly? Yeah, I think that's what it\n\n04:42.240 --> 04:47.600\nwas. Yeah, because the service there was so bad, glacial, so bad that I, when the guy\n\n04:47.600 --> 04:52.440\ncame, how bad was it? It was, it was so bad that I kind of passed it because I was like,\n\n04:52.440 --> 04:58.520\nyeah, I'll have two more and the bill. You know, you ever do that when you're like, well,\n\n04:58.520 --> 05:05.840\nthese things take so long, give me three now. And then they'll come like when I want them.\n\n05:05.840 --> 05:13.120\nAnd then they all came and I was like, but I have to admire the fortitude that you've\n\n05:13.120 --> 05:16.480\nshowed by pouring yourself another one in the green room right before you walked out\n\n05:16.480 --> 05:23.880\non stage. That's just habit. You know why? That's why. I mean, really, that's habit.\n\n05:23.880 --> 05:37.240\nIt's not funny. I've been kind of stressed out. It's six days before Christmas for me.\n\n05:37.240 --> 05:43.200\nOn the 17th of December, Erin McGathy and Rob Schrab and his girlfriend, wife, Kate\n\n05:43.200 --> 05:49.520\nFreund and I leave for London. So December 17th, that's well after everybody shuts down\n\n05:49.520 --> 05:55.320\nin Los Angeles. And so it's December 10th right now, something around there. I have\n\n05:55.320 --> 06:06.520\nsix days to write a pilot for CBS, a pilot for Fox, and pack. Got to pack some fingerless\n\n06:06.520 --> 06:11.680\ngloves and research figure pudding. Aren't you the guy that was just boasting that you\n\n06:11.680 --> 06:16.200\nwrote Heat Vision and Jack at 36 hours? Yeah, that was at a different, much more joyful\n\n06:16.200 --> 06:22.320\ntime in my life. That was when I didn't know the rules of television. I don't know, I don't\n\n06:22.320 --> 06:27.640\nknow, whatever. I'm not, I'm not, these are... What are the rules of television, Dan? Always\n\n06:27.640 --> 06:43.160\nbe closing. Right. Think dog. Could there be a dog in it? And when possible, ask yourself\n\n06:43.160 --> 06:50.440\nlike, what would this be like according to Jim? I don't know, I don't know what the\n\n06:50.440 --> 06:56.640\nrule, you called my bluff. Congratulations. Call, I don't know how to write television.\n\n06:56.640 --> 07:05.080\nI never have. But... You got six days to write. Six days to write two pilots. Oh, there's\n\n07:05.080 --> 07:10.720\na TV show. Dan Harmon's got 16. That's a movie, that's a movie. But that's more of a bravo,\n\n07:10.720 --> 07:16.200\nyeah. Like, maybe it'll be fun, but... Don't look down at bravo, you're gonna be writing\n\n07:16.200 --> 07:21.840\nfor bravo one day. You're gonna be writing for bravo January. Right when I come back\n\n07:21.840 --> 07:27.760\nand Fox and CBS are like, hey, welcome back from London. What the fuck? And I go, sorry,\n\n07:27.760 --> 07:34.960\nI gotta go on tour. Okay, we have two notes. You're fired and you're never hired again.\n\n07:34.960 --> 07:51.880\nOkay, I'll address that. In Minnesota. Doesn't matter, I don't care. Christmas. I'm stalling.\n\n07:51.880 --> 07:55.320\nSaw the Avengers movie for the second time, but actually for the first time because I\n\n07:55.320 --> 08:03.000\nkept sleeping through it. Actually, I liked it a lot. I don't know who I'm talking to.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:13.840\nMaybe not 92% rotten tomatoes liked it, but I like the Avengers. Okay, done. Also, I'm\n\n08:13.840 --> 08:19.280\nnot gonna roll into one that's gonna put a barrier between us. Here's the second of\n\n08:19.280 --> 08:24.560\nthree. Also, I was quite fond of the Total Recall Remake. I thought it was, I don't know\n\n08:24.560 --> 08:29.600\nif you call it a remake or not, but whatever. It was starting to, starting to ruffle feathers.\n\n08:29.600 --> 08:36.760\nBut I think it can coexist with the Verhoeven Classic. They were both good. I liked watching\n\n08:36.760 --> 08:42.160\nArnold run around Mars with the three titties and give the people their air. I also like\n\n08:42.160 --> 08:47.600\nwatching What's His Name, not know that What's His Name was not his wife and what's her name\n\n08:47.600 --> 08:54.680\nactually was. That's why my one note is all the women look the same, but I have what used\n\n08:54.680 --> 09:01.000\nto be called Asperger's, which has now been removed from the diagnostic manual. I'm slightly\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:08.200\nautistic, so make one a redhead. If your movie has two women in it, always make one a redhead\n\n09:08.200 --> 09:18.360\nor make a Maria Conchita Alonso. Now, here's the point where we reach an impasse and we'll\n\n09:18.360 --> 09:27.960\nwork through it. I liked Cloud Atlas. I would say, I would say Harmontown 50-50 on that\n\n09:27.960 --> 09:33.160\none. Yeah. Okay. So Total Recall kind of was, okay, I put that in the wrong order. I liked\n\n09:33.160 --> 09:37.640\nCloud Atlas. It was, it's weird. Like every, you're never more than five minutes in Cloud\n\n09:37.640 --> 09:40.800\nAtlas because there's a lot of, for those of you who haven't seen it and I won't spoil\n\n09:40.800 --> 09:46.320\nanything. I don't know if it's possible to spoil anything. It ends revealing humanity\n\n09:46.320 --> 09:54.920\nis amazing and goes on forever into the stars. But if you think about it, that's what Green\n\n09:54.920 --> 10:03.880\nEggs and Ham revealed. So no big row to hoe there. But Cloud Atlas, because their whole\n\n10:03.880 --> 10:08.000\nshtick is reincarnation, I'm assuming it's based on some book series that made a better\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.520\nmeal out of this. So then it's time to commit it to film and, you know, like, well, we want\n\n10:12.520 --> 10:17.040\nto create the sense. So there's, people are being reincarnated and that we're all kind\n\n10:17.040 --> 10:20.280\nof intersecting with each other and playing different roles in our lives. There's a lot\n\n10:20.280 --> 10:26.920\nof prosthesis, a lot of, like, six actors. And then there's like, you know, Tom Hanks\n\n10:26.920 --> 10:31.240\nwill be like hanging out as a fisherman going like, it's hard to catch this fish. And then\n\n10:31.240 --> 10:37.760\nlike, it'll go like, Geneva, 1814. And he's like playing a piano, but he's got like a\n\n10:37.760 --> 10:43.080\nweird nose. But then Holly Berry comes in, even though she worked on the fishing dock,\n\n10:43.080 --> 10:49.440\nbut now she's like, you better compose that concerto, right? Every time they come in, they\n\n10:49.440 --> 10:54.400\nhave a different forehead, a different, like, they have like, like, zany zappers on, or\n\n10:54.400 --> 11:03.480\nlike a weird chin. You're never more than five minutes in Cloud Atlas from going, whoa!\n\n11:03.480 --> 11:07.600\nAnd that's not what you're supposed to do. The Cloud Atlas, you're supposed to spend\n\n11:07.600 --> 11:16.720\nthe whole time going, oh, but you're constantly going, what did it mean, more or less jarring\n\n11:16.720 --> 11:20.640\nto just cast different people in those roles. But if you, for us to catch on that that was\n\n11:20.640 --> 11:21.640\nthe reincarnated.\n\n11:21.640 --> 11:25.880\nWell, you never would catch on because there's too much to tell about. I bet in the, in the\n\n11:25.880 --> 11:32.720\nmove, in the book, I'm sure you don't need rubber noses and the same actor to indicate\n\n11:32.720 --> 11:37.880\nto you that this person, I have no idea, did anyone read the book or book series? We got\n\n11:37.880 --> 11:41.880\nit, we got a, we got a, we got one hand, we have two, two gals here who read the book.\n\n11:41.880 --> 11:42.880\nAll right.\n\n11:42.880 --> 11:44.880\nIs it, well, whatever, I don't know what to ask.\n\n11:44.880 --> 11:49.080\nSomebody gave me that book years ago and I feel like it's true, like, I liked not reading\n\n11:49.080 --> 11:58.000\nthe book more than not seeing the movie.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:08.680\nOh, I made a joke. I joke about a book.\n\n12:08.680 --> 12:09.680\nPlease reserve that.\n\n12:09.680 --> 12:15.560\nNo problem. If you want to say where I have nothing to say, I don't know, that cat's out\n\n12:15.560 --> 12:20.520\nof the bag. Sorry I got you drunk tonight. I'm going to make it up to you.\n\n12:20.520 --> 12:23.800\nYou seem exactly as drunk as you are every Harmontown.\n\n12:23.800 --> 12:28.640\nI guess I can tell. I don't know. I always, like, I have nights where I'm like, they\n\n12:28.640 --> 12:33.840\ncan tell. Like, I, and I, and then I project that on to, like, if I'm talking and I go\n\n12:33.840 --> 12:38.120\nlike, Hey, come on, it's Christmas. Hey, what's the deal with ornaments? And then I'll hear\n\n12:38.120 --> 12:44.200\nlike a, oh, and then I'll go, she knows I'm drunk. She knows I'm too drunk. I'm not going\n\n12:44.200 --> 12:47.200\nto look at her.\n\n12:47.200 --> 12:48.200\nBut uh,\n\n12:48.200 --> 12:49.200\nThat was a guy.\n\n12:49.200 --> 12:59.120\nYou pointed at the guy. Drunk. Can't, can't see anybody. It's all because of the waiter\n\n12:59.120 --> 13:04.160\nat the pikey. Another interesting thing about the pikey, if you're a local, we can edit\n\n13:04.160 --> 13:09.280\nthis out because who in Boston's going to care about this. But uh, go over to the pikey.\n\n13:09.280 --> 13:16.480\nIt's a kitty corner ish from here. It used to be the coach and horses and then it turned\n\n13:16.480 --> 13:22.440\ninto this, this place. Uh, well, the big highlight for me is, uh, uh, alternate timelines. Givi\n\n13:22.440 --> 13:27.480\nJeff Davis, uh, works there. There's like a guy, if you ever go in, he, he wears like\n\n13:27.480 --> 13:33.840\nthese beige suits and he, he looks, he looks a lot like Jeff. It kind of like spends too\n\n13:33.840 --> 13:38.200\nmuch time on making his hair look like he didn't spend any time on it. And like,\n\n13:38.200 --> 13:41.600\nBut if he like was from like 10s year is from like 85.\n\n13:41.600 --> 13:46.640\nYeah. He's getting vaguely, very vaguely multi-ethnic. Like you don't know where from\n\n13:46.640 --> 13:50.720\nwhere it's like, like his mom was, you know, worked on the docs of his dad was a minister\n\n13:50.720 --> 13:58.120\nfrom, uh, but he's a, yeah, he's very, very creepy, very creepy version of Jeff Davis.\n\n13:58.120 --> 14:01.520\nBut there's also a very lovely guy up front. There's a black dude named hallelujah, which\n\n14:01.520 --> 14:04.920\nis an awesome name. Yeah. Hallelujah is a good name.\n\n14:04.920 --> 14:13.800\nSeems like cheating in the, in the name. Okay. My name's awesome. Let's all, let's all just\n\n14:13.800 --> 14:18.680\ngo fuck ourselves. All right. My name's butterfly. Like some of us have to hunker down and be\n\n14:18.680 --> 14:24.840\nJohn or hallelujah is not cool, but I don't want to jump all over this guy. Never met\n\n14:24.840 --> 14:38.960\nhim. Already jealous. Uh, I, uh, oh shit, you're fucked up. Yeah. Should I pick you\n\n14:38.960 --> 14:45.720\na slower beat to rap to a slow beat to rap? Like a slow rap, like a slow regretful rap.\n\n14:45.720 --> 14:59.840\nI feel like maybe what it, you know, I usually go with the stationary mic stand, but maybe\n\n14:59.840 --> 15:04.720\nmaybe like, I should loosen up so that you can't tell. I think that I think the mics\n\n15:04.720 --> 15:10.760\nin a stand like helps you know how drunk I am. But if I, if the whole thing's moving\n\n15:10.760 --> 15:17.200\nthen you can't tell, right? I seem sober now. Give it some of that, give it some of that\n\n15:17.200 --> 15:32.840\ndame cook karate moves. You know, dame cook it up. Let's try the slower beat. Yo, yo, slow\n\n15:32.840 --> 15:43.480\nrap, you know, a slow rap, you know, a slow rap. No, that didn't work. You just kept\n\n15:43.480 --> 15:50.280\nsaying slow rap. Well, I, I've worked my way into it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\n\n15:50.280 --> 15:57.640\nSlow rap. Like if you're just going to keep saying slow rap, I will clear this room.\n\n15:57.640 --> 16:05.520\nAll right. I need to start immediately. No, no, no, no. He's into it. He's into it. Slow\n\n16:05.520 --> 16:13.560\nrap. Yeah. Yeah. You've made that quite clear. Am I allowed? Yeah. Yeah. Slow rap. Yeah.\n\n16:13.560 --> 16:23.520\nSlow rap. Cities coast to coast. Gotta motherfucker knows the most. Gotta put your mama on some\n\n16:23.520 --> 16:31.280\ntoast. I gotta go to fuck your mama's ghost. I gotta, because I fucked her to death. I\n\n16:31.280 --> 16:39.000\ngotta did too much crystal meth. I fucked your, I fucked your mama to death. And then I fucked\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:46.800\nher, fucked her harder to death. I gotta fuck your mama in a slow rap. Fuck your mama slow\n\n16:46.800 --> 16:54.480\nas crap. Fuck your mama all over the stage. Fuck your mama. I'm a third level mage.

Fuck your mama in the button felt poop. No, weird. There's a disconnect\n\n17:17.400 --> 17:24.160\nhere. And I'm supposed to rap about that. We found your tempo and also found your audience.\n\n17:24.160 --> 17:31.640\nWho are you guys? Did all the colleges get off for Christmas? Like all of a sudden, like\n\n17:31.640 --> 17:37.080\nwe're fucking like this is amazing. You felt her poop when you fucked her. Where have you\n\n17:37.080 --> 17:41.920\nguys been? You know, Dan, they've been at college and they miss their mothers. You brought\n\n17:41.920 --> 17:48.000\nthem back home. Sick of hearing about Kierkegaard. Just feel someone's poop. There's no place\n\n17:48.000 --> 18:00.960\nlike home for the holidays. So I guess the hobbit's gonna be three movies. Well, someone's\n\n18:00.960 --> 18:09.480\nnot okay. Who said okay? You're into it. All right. Can you come up? Do you want to come\n\n18:09.480 --> 18:17.360\nup and talk about it? He asked you would you get up on stage? Because the audience isn't\n\n18:17.360 --> 18:25.600\nMike's for the podcast. We don't bully people here. We don't make fun of people for coming\n\n18:25.600 --> 18:30.880\nup. I just like to hear people and meet people. Have you been here before last week? Oh,\n\n18:30.880 --> 18:40.760\nokay. Does this work? Yeah. I'm not that tall. Yeah, you are. I'm as tall as you. Are you\n\n18:40.760 --> 18:47.880\nlike a height arexic? You are exactly that tall. It's pointed at your mouth. Dan, Dan.\n\n18:47.880 --> 18:53.920\nI used to work at a rehab center and they would in the eating disorder unit, they would\n\n18:53.920 --> 19:00.360\ndo this. Like they told me this. They for anorexic women, they had this therapy technique where\n\n19:00.360 --> 19:05.040\nthey would have them draw how big they thought their body was, and then lay them down in\n\n19:05.040 --> 19:10.600\nit and take a picture of them. Like, what is this? Sesame Street? Is that how anorexial\n\n19:10.600 --> 19:16.280\nworks really? You can actually just think that your physical body is it? Anyways, I don't\n\n19:16.280 --> 19:24.440\nknow. What's your name? Who's the villain? What's your name? Phil. That's okay. You don't\n\n19:24.440 --> 19:29.960\nhave to be Thor. Phil, I'm gonna have to do this because tonight is a no Mike stand night.\n\n19:29.960 --> 19:35.760\nYou're gonna have to, Dan, cook this. There you go. Put that Mike stand away. Yeah. I'm\n\n19:35.760 --> 19:41.400\nenforcing the no Mike stand rule. All right. We're all like, there's not much to talk about\n\n19:41.400 --> 19:46.080\nwith the Hobbit. It's probably gonna be nine hours. It's probably gonna be extended to\n\n19:46.080 --> 19:51.560\n12 hours. But okay, I read the Hobbit. Yeah. I did not so much read the Lord of the Rings\n\n19:51.560 --> 19:56.400\ntrilogy, but it was a, the Lord of the Rings trilogy was a trilogy in book form. Yes. So\n\n19:56.400 --> 20:01.240\nthey made a movie for each book. The Hobbit was one book. Yep. So if they make a, where\n\n20:01.240 --> 20:07.640\nthe red fern grows movie and they make it three movies, we get to go, what is the first\n\n20:07.640 --> 20:12.720\nmovie going to be about the red fern growing? Are they never going to get to the Coonhounds\n\n20:12.720 --> 20:22.720\ndying? I mean, they can kind of stretch it. Spoilers, sorry. The Coonhounds die. I mean,\n\n20:22.720 --> 20:26.720\nthere's, there's a lot to stretch with that movie. There's, there's a war that just happens\n\n20:26.720 --> 20:32.560\nto be only like 50 pages from what I remember. Yeah. And they're making Anna Karenina one\n\n20:32.560 --> 20:38.600\nmovie. That book is long. That's like a 900 page book, 1200 page book. I read that thing.\n\n20:38.600 --> 20:44.560\nYou could make 18 movies out of that. Oh, it's true. Well, I said, are you, are you,\n\n20:44.560 --> 20:48.080\nwill you accept that you're up here in defense of the Hobbit being three movies in the face\n\n20:48.080 --> 20:54.800\nof a society that is crying out? Why not, why not merge these kill bills into one 90 minute\n\n20:54.800 --> 21:02.480\nthing? Like, kill billboards. And you're saying the reason why, I mean, I would call it kill\n\n21:02.480 --> 21:07.440\nbillboards. Like I just found out five minutes ago and I'm already defending this. You just,\n\n21:07.440 --> 21:13.400\nI told you. Yeah. You found out from me that the Hobbit's three movies. I thought it was\n\n21:13.400 --> 21:25.400\ntrue. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm Nikki Fink. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Deadline Hollywood news\n\n21:25.400 --> 21:32.640\ncomes from me to your neighborhood. I got the ear to the Hollywood ground. I got some\n\n21:32.640 --> 21:39.880\nnew scoops from the Hobbit I found. I heard the date line LA is three movies. Oh, shit.\n\n21:39.880 --> 21:47.640\nSome people think it's not groovy, but motherfucker, MC Phil's all right with it. Now we're going\n\n21:47.640 --> 21:52.480\nto fight with it. Stupid. But you told me it was four movies. I would have been okay\n\n21:52.480 --> 21:58.400\nwith it. Okay. So your, your point being prolong the enjoyment rather than have to sit through\n\n21:58.400 --> 22:03.760\nthe like, like, like they make 50,000 shitty movies a year. When Peter Jackson's behind\n\n22:03.760 --> 22:08.640\nthe camera and the content is, is he directing them? Yes, I hope so. Certainly not going\n\n22:08.640 --> 22:16.600\nto ask you. I know where you get your news. You're saying as long as Peter Jackson's behind\n\n22:16.600 --> 22:20.320\nthe camera and they're, and they're in New Zealand and there's, and there's, and there's,\n\n22:20.320 --> 22:25.840\nand they're dealing with that awesome original like material, you'll watch it forever. Yeah.\n\n22:25.840 --> 22:29.240\nLike, you know, you hope that every movie is eight hours long and there's one a week.\n\n22:29.240 --> 22:33.560\nI saw King Kong in theaters. I'm like, I may have thought that was a half hour long, like\n\n22:33.560 --> 22:40.400\nmaybe two and a half hours too long, but I still saw it. Right. All right. Well, all\n\n22:40.400 --> 22:44.560\nright. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to, it's hard to tell them to fuck off. I've never read\n\n22:44.560 --> 22:49.760\nTolkien, but I really like the Lord of the Rings films. And I, I don't mind it being\n\n22:49.760 --> 22:54.480\nprolonged entertainment if they're all good. Well, certainly the appeal of the Tolkien\n\n22:54.480 --> 23:03.800\nuniverse, if I can call it that. No, you may not, sir. Let's ask Janet Tolkien. Absolutely\n\n23:03.800 --> 23:13.400\nno. Yeah, I heard she's the black sheep of the family. I heard half of the Silmarillion\n\n23:13.400 --> 23:25.200\nwhen upper nose. Half of the money. Like that was it. Not this half. That was it. That was a deep cut Tolkien reference.\n\n23:25.200 --> 23:34.920\nAll right. Well, okay. I mean, yeah, the appeal of the Tolkieniverse is the texture. The feel\n\n23:34.920 --> 23:41.960\nthat you're there, but I'm serious. Like, let's see. Have you read the Hobbit? Yes. So, so let's break\n\n23:41.960 --> 23:46.640\nthe Hobbit up into three parts. Breaking the Hobbit up into three parts. Where do you think the first\n\n23:46.640 --> 23:52.720\nmovie is going to end? Like, probably when they reach the dragon, probably you probably, no, no, no.\n\n23:52.720 --> 24:00.680\nWait, dinner is when it will end at the dinner. And the second movie will begin with Jesus Christ,\n\n24:00.680 --> 24:06.680\nso many dishes. I can't believe we ate all of that lasagna. But we should think about fighting a\n\n24:06.680 --> 24:12.720\ndragon. And so it came to pass that they thought about fighting a dragon. Dan, this guy here has a\n\n24:12.720 --> 24:18.440\npretty good opinion about where he thinks the first break. Oh, Jesus, this guy? Yeah. All right. You\n\n24:18.440 --> 24:22.680\ntold me you were gonna rate my soul last week. Yeah, we did it. We did a bit. You were very good. Thank\n\n24:22.680 --> 24:30.160\nyou. Remind us of your name, please. Ben, my name's Ben. Ben, welcome back. Ben. Thank you. Last week,\n\n24:30.160 --> 24:37.560\nwe kept pretending he was Greg Barrett, and then he was at the show. For my understanding of it,\n\n24:37.560 --> 24:42.320\nwhich is fairly limited as well, it's that the third movie is actually going to be another book that\n\n24:42.320 --> 24:53.840\ncomes between the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings series. No, am I wrong? Get up here. Come on. No,\n\n24:53.840 --> 24:59.440\nyou stay. Stay. Because this is how the first Hobbit movie is going to be. As far as I understand\n\n24:59.440 --> 25:04.600\nthe book, it's just a bunch of fucking dwarfs, like, like, crowding into a hobbit. Hey, I'm here. Let's\n\n25:04.600 --> 25:09.880\ngo ahead. That's going to be the whole movie. We're halfway through the first movie. Is the first\n\n25:09.880 --> 25:17.440\nmovie just going to be a Tom Bombadil movie? I don't know. I don't know. I get it. Tom Bombadil was\n\n25:17.440 --> 25:22.040\ncut out of the first Lord of the Rings, and a lot of fanboys got very upset. This character was cut\n\n25:22.040 --> 25:27.560\nout. The original plan for the Hobbit movies was there was going to be, the Hobbit was going to be\n\n25:27.560 --> 25:31.600\none movie, and then there was going to be a second movie, which was going to bridge the Hobbit with\n\n25:31.600 --> 25:37.240\nthe Lord of the Rings, which people got upset about because there's no literary reference to\n\n25:37.240 --> 25:46.000\nbridge. I don't remember the name of it. I don't remember the name of it, but there is a book that\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:58.480\ntook, what's it called? Get up here. Get on stage. Somebody Instagram this immediately. This is\n\n25:58.480 --> 26:04.880\nFalcom and Malcolm and Tookin and Pookin. Are you guys talking about the Lost Tales? Is that what\n\n26:04.880 --> 26:11.040\nyou're talking about? No. There was that compendium of that Christopher Tolkien found in, I'll shut\n\n26:11.040 --> 26:19.480\nit up. That's Mormon. All right. Unrelated. Again, my knowledge is as limited as these gentlemen,\n\n26:19.480 --> 26:33.080\nbut there's a bunch of... Everyone keeps saying that, but... Terry. Get up here. We're getting a\n\n26:33.080 --> 26:40.160\nbigger stage. Okay. They're breaking the Hobbit into three movies. Wait a second. There's a guy\n\n26:40.160 --> 26:48.040\nwho's a bartender from the pikey. Okay. The first movie is the travel to Smog, the dragon, and then\n\n26:48.040 --> 26:52.400\nthe second movie is all about fighting the dragon. And then the third movie is about Dale and the\n\n26:52.400 --> 26:57.000\nbattle of the five armies. And they're taking additional information from the Simerillian to\n\n26:57.000 --> 27:02.280\nfill in when Gandalf left for 90 pages and then came back and they're just making it up based off\n\n27:02.280 --> 27:07.040\nof like 20 minutes or 20 pages of him being like, oh, I thought Sauron, blah, blah, blah. That might\n\n27:07.040 --> 27:15.960\nbe kind of cool. When he fights Sauron, the wizard or whatever, they fill that in and they're\n\n27:15.960 --> 27:21.400\ngoing to show it instead. So they get all the way to the precipice of fighting Smog. But they don't\n\n27:21.400 --> 27:27.520\nactually do it. But that first Lord of the Rings movie, they didn't get a lot done, but it was very\n\n27:27.520 --> 27:33.720\nexciting. Yeah, it's mostly walking. So they fight Smog the whole second movie, which would be pretty\n\n27:33.720 --> 27:39.760\nbadass. I've actually never read the book. Guaranteed you Empire Strikes Back. He's never read it. That's\n\n27:39.760 --> 27:45.560\nall right. He doesn't have to. If this was about literature, this wouldn't be a billion dollar\n\n27:45.560 --> 27:57.200\nindustry. How much have you guys read today? But all right, so what's your name, hero, from the\n\n27:57.200 --> 28:03.040\nmiddle audience? My name is Tyler. Tyler. You've never read the books, but you know more than\n\n28:03.040 --> 28:10.480\nthese guys who have clearly read these books. Well, I saw that like 1988 cartoon that has the hobbits back\n\n28:10.480 --> 28:21.480\nthen. Did Ralph Bakshi direct that? Yes. See, that's all I know about talking. You guys get so mad when\n\n28:21.480 --> 28:27.080\nyou agree with things. I grew up on that stuff, like seeing it and not knowing it from, yeah, I was\n\n28:27.080 --> 28:33.000\njust like being disturbed by it, like that and Watership Down. I'm afraid to watch it again\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:40.960\nin adulthood. All right. Well, it's cool that you wore a Newsy cap because you really brought extra\n\n28:40.960 --> 28:47.800\nand made us know all about it. There are fanboys that are here. I just had to come represent, I guess.\n\n28:47.800 --> 28:54.840\nAll right. Well, I guess let's have a hand for the Fellowship of Looking Forward to the Hobbit.\n\n28:54.840 --> 29:11.840\nNext week is going to be Jane Austen, ladies. Yeah, sharpen your corrections. Don't know. All right.\n\n29:11.840 --> 29:20.760\nThat was exciting. It gets exciting fast here. You never know what's going to happen. I can't believe\n\n29:20.760 --> 29:30.120\nthat. There are guys shaking each other's hands. The Newsy guy went and sat down and then the guy in\n\n29:30.120 --> 29:37.040\nfront of him turned around and was like, thank you for whatever you did. You represent something up\n\n29:37.040 --> 29:44.600\nthere. I don't know what you said. They might work together, but I want to think that he was like,\n\n29:44.600 --> 29:51.360\nthank you so much for what you said. It was so brave. It reminds me of my jury duty story. Did\n\n29:51.360 --> 29:55.520\nI ever tell my jury duty story up here when I was in Milwaukee? If you didn't wait before podcast\n\n29:55.520 --> 30:00.600\ntime and probably before. I'm going to breeze through it really fast. I tell the story as much as you\n\n30:00.600 --> 30:04.760\ndo probably because this is the greatest, greatest day of my life. It was the only day when I was as\n\n30:04.760 --> 30:10.000\nmuch a hero as the Hobbits and the Bobbits. Will you give me a favor? Will you take this five minute\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:16.760\nstory and break it up over three podcasts? Get us into your current driving two jury days. The first\n\n30:16.760 --> 30:22.520\none takes you to me showing up at the courthouse and then I insert a whole scene where, yeah,\n\n30:22.520 --> 30:36.120\nSean Astin says, think about it this way. You're right. This is a good ending. I went to jury\n\n30:36.120 --> 30:42.240\nduty. The year is 1972. Close. It was like 90 something. I was still in Milwaukee. It was a very\n\n30:42.240 --> 30:48.840\nyoung, spry little child, little writer and improviser living in Milwaukee. I went to jury\n\n30:48.840 --> 30:54.600\nduty. Never gone to jury duty before. You spend the whole time. You get quickly indoctrinated into\n\n30:54.600 --> 30:59.760\nthe culture of, I got to get out of here. We're the suckers. We got to get out of here. People\n\n30:59.760 --> 31:05.480\nexplaining it to you. No one's going like, congratulations on jury duty. They know that\n\n31:05.480 --> 31:10.160\nthey need to ingratiate themselves to you by saying, sorry, you're at jury duty. They're right\n\n31:10.160 --> 31:18.600\nto do that. It's a drag if you're over 12. It might be exciting for someone who still thinks\n\n31:18.600 --> 31:23.480\npencils might be spaceships. You could maybe occupy yourself. Everyone else wants to kill\n\n31:23.480 --> 31:32.960\nthemselves. You spend the whole time getting called and not called. You're told you're on the\n\n31:32.960 --> 31:39.520\nprecipice of getting dismissed. We were so close to, me and my group, we were so close to getting\n\n31:39.520 --> 31:45.560\nout and then we got called for this case. We're like, fuck you. At that point, you go through\n\n31:45.560 --> 31:51.600\nphases where you go, I kind of actually, I don't want to seem uncool to my peers here, but I actually\n\n31:51.600 --> 31:56.840\nkind of think it would be cool if I got called in and someone murdered someone and I had to decide\n\n31:56.840 --> 32:00.560\nyou murdered someone. You have these thoughts in your head. I'm going to be a juror. It's going to\n\n32:00.560 --> 32:05.480\nbe amazing. But then you, that quickly fades and you go, I got to get out of here. Please let me,\n\n32:05.480 --> 32:11.760\nI'm so close. And then they call you and you have to go and you shuffle into the courtroom. And we\n\n32:11.760 --> 32:17.320\nend up in the jury box and it's all kind of random. And I ended up the juror number one. I was like\n\n32:17.320 --> 32:24.080\nsitting in the front. It's kind of randomly arranged. And it's, there's this kid sitting there.\n\n32:24.080 --> 32:32.720\nIt looked like he was like 16 years old. No idea how old he was, but yes, the defendant. I checked\n\n32:32.720 --> 32:45.960\nthe judge. Sorry. No, I will edit out whatever bored you. I just, I just, yeah. Slow. Slow story.\n\n32:45.960 --> 32:52.440\nSorry. No, no, it's not a slow story. I just, go ahead. Turns out the kid was like a, it was like a\n\n32:52.440 --> 32:59.960\npot, like possession thing. This kid lived in the outskirts of Wisconsin. And he was walking down a\n\n32:59.960 --> 33:05.440\nhighway. They, they give you all the details of the case. And he was, he was walking down like a\n\n33:05.440 --> 33:14.920\ncounty highway in his like little rural area of the, of the, of the, you know, free fire zone. Sector\n\n33:14.920 --> 33:21.600\nseven, where there's probably nothing to do but smoke pot. And he, a cop started coming, probably\n\n33:21.600 --> 33:27.840\nto the only cop where he lives. And he, the kid like had a pipe and it had a little bit of resin in\n\n33:27.840 --> 33:34.680\nit. And he, he like chucked his pipe into like a bunch of corn. Like a walkie is just why he was a\n\n33:34.680 --> 33:40.440\ncop coming and kind of went like this. Cop like stopped and got out and went through the corn and\n\n33:40.440 --> 33:47.160\nfound the pipe and, and, and took the kid in and, and at some point the kid apparently, this is why\n\n33:47.160 --> 33:55.520\nhe's my hero must have exercised his right to trial by jury because here I am now and, and, and, and\n\n33:55.520 --> 34:00.800\nthese other people and, and, and they, so they explain the details of the case. And then they go,\n\n34:00.800 --> 34:04.680\nthey say the thing that's like, if I'm sure most of you have been in jury duty, there's like that\n\n34:04.680 --> 34:12.480\nmoment where they go, does anyone feel like they wouldn't be able to be in partial in this case? And\n\n34:12.480 --> 34:17.320\nthen like, you see like the Jehovah's Witness lady, raise your hand and you watch her get to walk the\n\n34:17.320 --> 34:21.760\nfuck out. And you're like, where is Jehovah's Witness? Like you're like, you're trying to like,\n\n34:21.760 --> 34:25.480\nand then the, and then the person who was a victim of a, because they have witness in the name.\n\n34:26.960 --> 34:31.160\nIt used to be this, this has changed now, by the way, because I just recently did jury duty in LA\n\n34:31.160 --> 34:35.680\nand they were like, fuck you, fuck all of that. Like there, there, there's a portcullis comes down\n\n34:35.680 --> 34:41.120\nand they're like, nice try, asshole. But back then it was like someone went, I'm a Jehovah's Witness,\n\n34:41.120 --> 34:45.680\nget the fuck out. I can't sit in judgment of others. And then someone else, I was a victim of a violent\n\n34:45.680 --> 34:50.960\ncrime, fuck you. My friends at cop, go fuck yourself, get out, go home, go play Nintendo. And\n\n34:50.960 --> 34:57.000\nyou're like, well, and so this one was like handed to me on a silver platter, because the truth is\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:02.160\nlike, of course, I'm not going to judge this impartially, like leave the kid alone. It's like,\n\n35:02.160 --> 35:08.600\nlike he might end up being a senator if you don't bust him now for a fucking dumb ass pipe full of\n\n35:08.600 --> 35:13.080\na stupid thing that goes out of the ground. It's like, arrest the cop, throw him off a cliff.\n\n35:13.080 --> 35:19.160\nLike, I'm sure neither choice will measurably improve society, but there's a better chance that if\n\n35:19.160 --> 35:27.720\nthe cop like exploded, I'm in part, I'm not impartial. That's my point. I'm partial. I have a\n\n35:27.720 --> 35:35.800\nfeeling and a cop killer. I don't mean that. I just mean that they exploded. If you're a police\n\n35:35.800 --> 35:43.600\nofficer, I don't drive a silver Prius. I don't really, I'm not like, there's a lot of great people\n\n35:43.600 --> 35:47.040\nwho are cops and whatever. I don't mean that. And you would like to see them explode apparently.\n\n35:47.040 --> 35:57.200\nI meant like biologically like sci-fi wise. I didn't mean like, like, like El Ceda. See what\n\n35:57.200 --> 36:02.080\nsocieties become. This story takes place in a different universe before a lot of things went\n\n36:02.080 --> 36:08.280\ndown. The judge goes, does anyone think that they wouldn't be able to be impartial about this?\n\n36:08.280 --> 36:13.720\nAnd my hand shot up like a rocket because I was like, holy shit, I actually can't be impartial.\n\n36:13.720 --> 36:19.080\nI'm going to get out of jury duty. I raised it and everyone kind of chuckled, like, who was this\n\n36:19.080 --> 36:26.240\nyoung man's hand sure went up fast? And I was the, I was, I was juror number one, which made me the\n\n36:26.240 --> 36:30.600\njury foreman should it actually go to the thing. And then they're like, okay, sir, what's your\n\n36:30.600 --> 36:36.320\nproblem? And I said, well, I just don't, I don't think that this law should be a law. So I think\n\n36:36.320 --> 36:39.640\nthat any kind of legal proceeding about it the whole time, I'm going to be thinking like, well,\n\n36:39.640 --> 36:43.920\nlet's just get out of here. And I think that makes me like, I'm not going to be able to be\n\n36:43.920 --> 36:50.720\nimpartial because I, it's a, I don't, I don't, I don't see the crime here. And, and they're like,\n\n36:50.720 --> 36:55.320\nwell, no, but it is a crime. We didn't ask you if you think it should be a crime. We asked you if,\n\n36:55.320 --> 36:59.760\nif, if you think you could judge him in part, like they started really really laying into me.\n\n36:59.760 --> 37:04.680\nAnd I was like, well, yeah, but I'm telling you, like the customer is always right. You asked the\n\n37:04.680 --> 37:11.080\nquestion. Like, do you think that I would be able to judge it impartially? Like, like, who are you\n\n37:11.080 --> 37:17.880\ngoing to believe over me when I say no? And what better answer than because I don't, because I\n\n37:17.880 --> 37:21.880\nthink this is a plant that grows out of the ground. And I don't think he was hurting anybody. And I\n\n37:21.880 --> 37:25.960\ndon't, I think that, you know, it's your business. If you, you know, the larger society wants to\n\n37:25.960 --> 37:30.480\nhave a big war and like some kind of controlled substance. And I can't step into that because\n\n37:30.480 --> 37:35.680\nthat's a big mess. But I see a kid and I see a dumb pipe and I see a lot of ways to time. And I\n\n37:35.680 --> 37:39.680\nwant to get out of here. And I think it's like, you know, I just kind of like answered honestly.\n\n37:39.680 --> 37:45.680\nAnd then, but then they, they kept like, then the prosecutor got up and was like, no, I want to ask\n\n37:45.680 --> 37:49.480\nhim a question. Now, but don't you understand that it's illegal? It's yes, but I don't think it\n\n37:49.480 --> 37:54.480\nshould be. I don't think it should be. I don't know how many times to say this. And so we went back\n\n37:54.480 --> 38:02.840\nand forth for like 10 minutes. It was crazy. And I'm not exaggerating. Like, I hope you can trust me\n\n38:02.840 --> 38:07.120\nby now to know that like, I wouldn't exaggerate. Like I told you, I shoved a sharpie pen at my\n\n38:07.120 --> 38:14.480\nass. I don't like, if this story involved me being less than amazing, I would tell you the weird\n\n38:14.480 --> 38:19.600\nthing is I was awesome in this story. It was an accident. They made me awesome. I just went back\n\n38:19.600 --> 38:24.960\nand forth with them. And, and, and so then they're like, fine, whatever. And then so then because I\n\n38:24.960 --> 38:32.320\nwas juror number one, and everyone watched that happen, then they go, okay, let's move on. Does\n\n38:32.320 --> 38:37.640\nanyone else feel that they would be in part not be able to be impartial and like eight hands went\n\n38:37.640 --> 38:45.360\nup, including and I'm not kidding. It was like a fucking like, like romcom, like an old, old woman,\n\n38:45.360 --> 38:51.080\nlike a really old, like, brought knitting to jury duty, like, like not ironically, winota rider,\n\n38:51.080 --> 38:58.000\nwho knitting, but like, like, like, like knitting like her clothes for things like for cat, like,\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:04.080\nraised her hand like everybody and they went down like, okay, now, what about you? And I was like,\n\n39:04.080 --> 39:09.320\nwell, I think it's, you know, I guess like the young man said like, and then everybody they went\n\n39:09.320 --> 39:14.480\ndown. I was like, well, I guess it's like he said, I guess. And every and the judge was like this is\n\n39:14.480 --> 39:20.800\nlike clapping his hand. Because humanity is a resource. It's like so you like green in the\n\n39:20.800 --> 39:27.440\ncourthouse, like they need to flood these channels with human fucking bodies. And and and you can\n\n39:27.440 --> 39:33.600\nrevolt and go, no, we you need us to technically make the courthouses work. We don't want to be here.\n\n39:33.600 --> 39:38.800\nWe want to poop on you. It's in the Constitution. You're they tell you when you go to jury duty\n\n39:38.800 --> 39:42.240\nthat you're only there to judge the evidence. But in the Constitution, it actually says no,\n\n39:42.240 --> 39:47.520\nyou're also there to judge the validity of the law. You're there because you are the law. You're\n\n39:47.520 --> 39:51.280\njudge dread. You are allowed to say, what if I don't like the law? They go, that's not what we're\n\n39:51.280 --> 39:54.880\ndoing. They go, well, the Constitution says otherwise. And if you say, if you, by the way,\n\n39:54.880 --> 40:01.120\nif you want to get out of jury duty, stand and go, what's the court's stance on jury veto? They go,\n\n40:01.120 --> 40:07.360\nsee you later. They will validate your parking and give you a fucking bean burrito. And so all\n\n40:07.360 --> 40:11.760\nthis, everyone's got it was late in the day. And everyone's going like, I think what the young\n\n40:11.760 --> 40:18.480\nman said, I was like, he wasn't hurting anyone. And the judge went, guys, and the two lawyers came\n\n40:18.480 --> 40:28.080\nup, and they all walked away. They all left. And then, and then they went to the kid who was\n\n40:28.080 --> 40:36.800\nsitting there. Now, nobody but the jury, the jury just sitting there. Like, are you smoking a big\n\n40:36.800 --> 40:42.960\ncigar at this point? Not quite. Well, yeah, I guess in my head, I am. But like, but, but this is\n\n40:42.960 --> 40:46.960\nthe thing that reminds me of that moment when the guy turned and congratulate because the old\n\n40:46.960 --> 40:54.080\nwoman who was sitting in front of me, she turned in her chair and she put her ginger paper, a\n\n40:54.080 --> 41:01.280\nwonderful hallmark hand on my thigh and said, I just want to tell you, I think what you did was\n\n41:01.280 --> 41:14.960\nvery brave. I love getting high and I want to get out of jury duty. And I'm, I'm also brave.\n\n41:15.840 --> 41:21.120\nAmazing jackpot. And everyone was like, yeah, yeah, I was afraid to say something because I was\n\n41:21.120 --> 41:24.320\nafraid, you know, it's like, it's a courthouse. And then they're going to come to your house. So\n\n41:24.320 --> 41:28.640\nlike, do you guys comfortable living in that society? You really think that if you're in\n\n41:28.640 --> 41:32.720\nTrudy and said, well, I got a problem with this, that you'd go home and there'd be a cop going,\n\n41:32.720 --> 41:40.640\nwow, smarty pants. Sounds like you like the reefer. Now we got your name and number.\n\n41:40.640 --> 41:48.400\nWe'll shut you down, Herman. Stay away from the pool hall. Make that happen sooner than later if\n\n41:48.400 --> 41:52.480\nyou think that's possible. But that's, but now that's what's closer to the world we live in now\n\n41:52.480 --> 41:57.520\nfor certain. Probably. Yeah. Well, because you sure can't get out of jury duty anymore. But and so\n\n41:57.520 --> 42:03.040\nlike, I want, I want, I want the, the, so the judge comes back with the lawyers, everybody,\n\n42:03.040 --> 42:14.000\nthe kid is going, he's got a big giant smile on his face. And the judge says, so what happened is\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:23.920\nit's late in the day. And we, we just sort of settled the matter in chambers. And so there's\n\n42:23.920 --> 42:29.600\nno more case. And you guys are free to go, but I would like to talk to you in the hallway.\n\n42:29.600 --> 42:34.720\nThe judge said, to get the jurors. Yeah. Like, well, can you please meet me around front?\n\n42:34.720 --> 42:39.440\nI'd like to talk to you for a moment. So you're all free to go and get up out of the\n\n42:39.440 --> 42:45.600\njuror box and we all walk over to the doorway where the judge in his little robe, big robe,\n\n42:45.600 --> 42:51.360\nsorry, society, and his crown, can't, can't, can't came over. And he got, it's like,\n\n42:51.360 --> 42:54.960\nyou guys are free to go. I just want to let you know, you know, I don't approve of what you did\n\n42:54.960 --> 43:06.720\nin there, but I approve of the system that let you do it. I think it's amazing that you're able\n\n43:06.720 --> 43:10.160\nto do it. And that's, you know, a lot of people don't understand that's what the justice system\n\n43:10.160 --> 43:15.280\nis based on is your ability to do what you did. And I don't, you know, I think, I think something\n\n43:15.280 --> 43:20.640\nbad happened in there technically, but that's my own personal point of view. As a, as a, as a legal,\n\n43:20.640 --> 43:25.920\nas a legal person, I admire what happened in there. I mean, I don't, but I do. And it was like,\n\n43:25.920 --> 43:32.880\nshut up. He was basically saying, as far as I could understand, I don't want to, I should be\n\n43:32.880 --> 43:37.600\nillegal, but you guys are legally allowed to override. Yeah, exactly. Like, like, like, like,\n\n43:37.600 --> 43:44.160\nwhy don't you take that 15 year old kid and ruin his life for smoking weed? Because you're,\n\n43:44.160 --> 43:51.440\nbecause Thomas Jefferson said you could fuck off. Like, he was like mad, but like also didn't want\n\n43:51.440 --> 43:55.920\nto make his forefathers mad. Like, so weird. Well, he was a guy that actually read the\n\n43:55.920 --> 43:59.680\nconstitution. And when you go to the, I went to jury, dude, I've been there a couple of times.\n\n43:59.680 --> 44:04.640\nAnd the first time I was there, I was like, I don't know, I was in college, maybe 18 years old.\n\n44:04.640 --> 44:08.480\nAnd I was sitting there in a daily courthouse down there. I don't know if you guys have been\n\n44:08.480 --> 44:14.320\nthere, but it's, it's a bummer. And I'm sitting there and there was this bunch of people that\n\n44:14.320 --> 44:18.080\nsit in there. Some people are really happy about it. They got their juror badges on. They're really\n\n44:18.080 --> 44:22.880\nexcited about it. This is my civic duty. I get to be involved. Like, that's totally fine. If you\n\n44:22.880 --> 44:27.120\nwant to be there, that's a good juror, probably. Someone that wants to be there. I really, I'm\n\n44:27.120 --> 44:31.440\ninterested. I would like to check this out and hope I get a good case. A lot of people are like,\n\n44:31.440 --> 44:34.960\nI got a kid, I got a babysit later on, I got to go to school. And like, how do I get out of this\n\n44:34.960 --> 44:40.400\nthing? Well, there was a silent radio going by at the speed of sound. Like a little red, you know,\n\n44:40.400 --> 44:46.080\ndigital thing going by. And it was all in mumbo jumbo legalese saying like, in the event that\n\n44:48.080 --> 44:52.400\nLatin terms and stuff like that. And I read it once and I waited for it to cycle through again.\n\n44:52.400 --> 44:57.360\nIt's also where the snack bar is and where the restrooms are. And I grabbed this woman next to\n\n44:57.360 --> 45:02.640\nme. It's like, you know, housewifey lady next to me. I'm like, read this with me. And tell me if\n\n45:02.640 --> 45:05.920\nyou think this is what it's saying. And what it said is, if you don't feel like you should be here,\n\n45:05.920 --> 45:11.040\nyou can walk up Hill Street. And if you have the blues by being here right now, you can walk up\n\n45:11.040 --> 45:16.240\nHill Street. And you go to the fourth floor of a thing and you can say, you can throw out a form.\n\n45:16.800 --> 45:22.160\nAnd I read it three or four times. And I just got up and walked out. And like some guys like,\n\n45:23.040 --> 45:30.240\nwhoa, where you going, man? I'm like, I read that thing. I've been trying to read that thing for\n\n45:30.240 --> 45:37.200\nhalf an hour, but me too. It's like, I picture it as like green matrix characters. You can read that?\n\n45:37.200 --> 45:44.320\nYeah. But yeah, but like the silent radio, like it goes by and says a pizza, hard number is like,\n\n45:44.320 --> 45:47.680\nit goes by too fast. Like no one's going to get your delivery number on the silent radio out in\n\n45:47.680 --> 45:54.400\nfront of hard times pizza. It goes by too fast. And so I got in the elevator and then like,\n\n45:54.400 --> 45:58.000\nthere was really like a hand stop, the elevator from closing and there were like seven people\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:03.360\nthat were like, we're coming with you. And then like other people saw that we all got in and\n\n46:03.360 --> 46:07.920\nthere's people are getting out and they were coming toward us. So we walk up a block across\n\n46:07.920 --> 46:11.760\nlike Hill and whatever that is, hope or something like that. And we walk up the street and then we\n\n46:11.760 --> 46:15.680\ngo on a thing and we go and elevator and we look behind us and there's 15, 20 other people come\n\n46:17.200 --> 46:27.760\nand they're like, and I was so I didn't want to be there. So we go up to the fourth floor of the\n\n46:27.760 --> 46:33.280\nplace and an elevator door open and a bunch of like women mostly that work there and a little\n\n46:33.280 --> 46:37.520\ncubicles saw the elevator open and they saw 20 people come out. And they was like,\n\n46:41.520 --> 46:49.600\nonce a month, somebody reads that fucker. Another Pied Piper. So they give you a form and says,\n\n46:49.600 --> 46:54.080\nwhy don't you want to be here? And you can say, you can say this, you can say that. There's like\n\n46:54.080 --> 46:59.600\ntwo lines. If you if it's not one of the four things they give you as reasons, you can say why.\n\n46:59.600 --> 47:03.760\nAnd I was like, I don't believe the way the criminal justice like operates in the system,\n\n47:03.760 --> 47:07.840\noperates. I went in this big like, you know, Emma Goldman, like, I think like, it's like,\n\n47:07.840 --> 47:13.120\nlike, the system's on trial. And I was like, I wrote on the back of it and filled it up.\n\n47:14.320 --> 47:18.960\nOkay, this guy's going to be a bad juror. So I get there and they read through your stuff and\n\n47:18.960 --> 47:23.200\nthis woman, she says black lady, she had like, like, like, like, you know, crosses and very, like, a\n\n47:23.200 --> 47:28.240\nvery Christian black lady, like, very, very nice and very tired of her job. And she I said that,\n\n47:28.240 --> 47:33.520\nshe goes, All right, Jeff, she's looking at it. She's reading, she's like, she's reading the French.\n\n47:35.440 --> 47:39.440\nAnd she's he's like, turns over to the other side, she's got this, I just dense writing,\n\n47:40.400 --> 47:46.640\nlike Chaucer on the back. And she reads, she gets like halfway through, she goes, Jeff,\n\n47:46.640 --> 47:51.360\nJeff, I can't give them this, they're going to make you be a juror, just go in there, tell them\n\n47:51.360 --> 47:54.480\nyou don't want to be there, they'll probably let you out of it. I go, I don't want to spend the\n\n47:54.480 --> 48:00.480\nrest of my week, like, going to jury juror selection and doing like, I don't want to be here. And\n\n48:00.480 --> 48:05.920\nlike, I can't say that. And I go, What can I say? What can I write on this piece of paper that gets\n\n48:05.920 --> 48:17.040\nme out of it? And she goes, and she stands up a little bit and looks over. She's so sick of me. And\n\n48:17.040 --> 48:23.520\nthe job. And she says, she looks back down, like she makes your nose wasn't just say religious,\n\n48:24.560 --> 48:35.120\nI'm like, Religious, she's just right religious on the card. I thought, Religious, like Jeff,\n\n48:35.120 --> 48:41.840\nDavis sign it. So I had John Hancocked it. And she goes, you're free to go. I'm like,\n\n48:42.800 --> 48:46.240\ntell everybody that she's like, if we told everybody that there wouldn't be any juries\n\n48:46.240 --> 48:51.840\nin there anymore. Now you can't so I got another summons 10 years later, I thought I thought I was\n\n48:51.840 --> 48:57.360\noff to the books forever. I thought that was, you know, that guy was like done with that. No,\n\n48:57.360 --> 49:02.160\nthey changed the system. I got the jury thing again, and I wrote religious this and that and\n\n49:02.160 --> 49:07.760\nthen you got another thing back that said, get your ass in here. Nice try or go to jail. So I\n\n49:07.760 --> 49:13.920\ngot beside I went online and I read about juror veto and I was prepared for that one. But fortunately,\n\n49:13.920 --> 49:18.880\nI actually had a thing. But I went in the last I would do juror. By the way, I would do jury duty\n\n49:18.880 --> 49:23.040\nnow. I'm not that busy anymore. I would do it. I'd be interested. I think that's how I felt is\n\n49:23.040 --> 49:28.400\nlike the same way I feel about software piracy. Like I stole my ass a lot of Adobe shit. So if I\n\n49:28.400 --> 49:34.800\nneed Photoshop, I made enough money off of using Photoshop for free. Like they if I have it, like\n\n49:34.800 --> 49:40.000\nthey get it and we all it all worked out for all of us in the end. Like when I was two when it went,\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:46.800\nyou know, when that $5 a day wasn't going to cover my rent. Yeah, I was like fuck jury duty. But\n\n49:46.800 --> 49:51.520\nnow I'm like, Okay, this will be I'll go in. I'll do my duty. It's a duty. Like if nobody did it,\n\n49:51.520 --> 49:55.600\nwhat the fuck are you gonna do? What about that kid who's got caught smoking pot by a dick cop?\n\n49:55.600 --> 50:00.320\nLike, like, there's a kid out there, you could make a difference. So I so I went into the LA\n\n50:00.320 --> 50:05.760\nSuperior Court, and I went through two days of this business. And and I'm not it was just funny\n\n50:05.760 --> 50:10.640\nbecause the, you know, went through all this thing. And I was like, like, my heart was pumping,\n\n50:10.640 --> 50:15.440\nI'm like, am I going to try to get out of it? Am I going to like try to say I won't be impartial?\n\n50:15.440 --> 50:20.080\nBut I watched them pick off one by one. And by pick off, I mean, not pick off, like, like,\n\n50:20.080 --> 50:27.040\npeople tried to get out of jury duty. It just said, like, no, it's a religious. And they're\n\n50:27.040 --> 50:33.760\nlike, fuck you sit down. Welcome to the jury. And how about you, man? But it got disturbing\n\n50:33.760 --> 50:41.600\nbecause there was a woman who stood up and said like, like, I'm a writer and sometimes an actor\n\n50:42.560 --> 50:47.520\nhave even dabbled in directing. I think I can tell a lady faking being the victim of a violent\n\n50:47.520 --> 50:54.240\ncrime and not wanting to be a part of this and being emotionally traumatized by it. And she was\n\n50:54.240 --> 51:02.160\neither Meryl Streep or was I watched a woman get abused a second time by the system, because she\n\n51:02.160 --> 51:07.520\nwas like, I just can't she was fucked up about it, because they tell you the details of the crime.\n\n51:07.520 --> 51:12.240\nWe got this guy stabbed this guy, and then this thing happened. And she's like, I can't do this.\n\n51:12.240 --> 51:15.920\nI've been through this before. This is not this is not what she's already been on the panel when\n\n51:15.920 --> 51:22.240\nthey're saying they really she's on the panel. Oh, so this is real juror slash. Yeah. And it was\n\n51:22.240 --> 51:27.440\nokay. Good. Sit back down. And it was like, like nobody got let go. They did not do any of that\n\n51:27.440 --> 51:32.160\nbusiness. And I was in the elevator with her. And I turned to her was an awkward moment because\n\n51:32.160 --> 51:37.920\nI didn't I turned to her and I said, like, I can't believe they didn't let you go. And she\n\n51:37.920 --> 51:44.480\nresponded to me like, like really emotionally. So like, I wasn't trying to get let go. I was just\n\n51:44.480 --> 51:49.280\nbeing honest. Like, like, I she thought that I was saying like, yeah, jury duty, right? Fuck this\n\n51:49.280 --> 51:53.200\nshit. But I can't believe they didn't buy that. You know, like, you know what I mean? Like, like,\n\n51:53.200 --> 51:57.920\nlike, I felt like I was part of the I was like, no, I just meant like, I can't believe the government\n\n51:57.920 --> 52:04.240\nis terrible and raped you in there. But but it felt like I was God, God, it was the worst. But at\n\n52:04.240 --> 52:08.000\nthe end of it. So I'm not like, okay, I'm doing jury duty, because I just watch this lady get\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:17.360\ntrounced, like, I'm not going to go up there and go, no, no, no, I'm racist. I'm not doing it.\n\n52:18.560 --> 52:23.600\nI'm just so I can tweet it. And like, because that lady is going to be haunting me for the\n\n52:23.600 --> 52:28.560\nrest of my life. That that jury duty is duty. So I saw it. So that better be the name of this\n\n52:28.560 --> 52:40.160\npodcast. So I so I hunkered down for the due diligence. And we end the whole day. And then I\n\n52:40.160 --> 52:45.120\ngo home, I'm busy as fuck. I'm like, I got to go back. It's a bummer to have to go downtown. It's\n\n52:45.120 --> 52:50.320\nblah, blah, blah, blah, you know, first world problems. But I go back, and I'm there. And we\n\n52:50.320 --> 52:54.720\nshow up and we're waiting outside the courtroom. And we wait and we wait and we wait. And the guy\n\n52:54.720 --> 53:02.160\ncomes out at a certain point goes like, there's been a development. And you can go to lunch.\n\n53:02.160 --> 53:07.280\nSo I went to lunch. This was the day that the space shuttle was being flown all around LA. I\n\n53:07.280 --> 53:11.040\ndon't know if this is an important part of the story. But it was an odd experience for me because\n\n53:11.040 --> 53:16.640\nI had no idea. I was on jury duty. It was just like, like, I got to get a drink. It's it's 11am.\n\n53:16.640 --> 53:22.320\nAnd I've never I never hang out downtown. So I'm just like walking. I looked on my\n\n53:22.320 --> 53:28.240\npara street and you go have you have a margarita. I looked on my phone for martini icons and was\n\n53:28.240 --> 53:33.920\nlike following it. And as I'm walking across this park, there's like this industrial park.\n\n53:35.440 --> 53:42.000\nIt was like a zombie movie. Like, everyone was like looking at a fixed point in the sky. And I\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:48.080\nkept like nine times I kept looking for like a suicide jumper. And there was never anything I\n\n53:48.080 --> 53:51.520\njust kept walking. I was like, maybe this is what happens to people when they work downtown. Like,\n\n53:51.520 --> 53:56.560\nmaybe they maybe they're like cattle. Maybe they're just grazing freedom. Like, they're just looking\n\n53:56.560 --> 54:02.240\nat the moon. Like, what would it be like there? You could live in a crater and\n\n54:03.760 --> 54:09.920\nlike, no one would ever fuck with you. Just keep looking at it. Just suck it up into my eyeballs\n\n54:09.920 --> 54:16.240\nfor another six hours of data entry. And I finally couldn't stand it. It was like, what? I just stopped\n\n54:16.240 --> 54:22.800\nthis one lady. I was like, it didn't stop her. She stopped me. Whatever. Harmon. There's a footnote\n\n54:22.800 --> 54:26.960\nsession. The the I said, what are you what is everybody looking at? I'm really sorry. And\n\n54:26.960 --> 54:34.640\nshe's like, you don't know. I was like, I don't know. It's just like the space shuttle's coming.\n\n54:35.680 --> 54:42.320\nI was like, what do you mean it's coming? Like, what? What do you mean? I still didn't understand.\n\n54:42.320 --> 54:49.920\nThe Williamsburg wagons. They got honey. They got scarves. I did a new scarf from Neptune.\n\n54:49.920 --> 54:54.160\nLike, I was like, I thought, did they decommission that fucking thing? I go, what? What do you mean?\n\n54:54.160 --> 55:00.000\nIt's why is it coming to Los Angeles? What is it doing here? And, and, but I was like,\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:06.800\nspace shuttle's coming. And I just, I just kept walking between people and went into an empty\n\n55:06.800 --> 55:11.200\nlike P.F. Changs or something. It was like, give me everything you have behind the bar.\n\n55:11.200 --> 55:15.280\nBecause I had to go back to jury duty. Watch that figured it out on the TV. They're like,\n\n55:15.280 --> 55:19.280\noh, they're taking the space shuttle everywhere. They're flying it all around all over the goddamn\n\n55:19.280 --> 55:24.720\nplace for some reason. Some weird while that while you were there, I was, uh, I got a text from\n\n55:25.440 --> 55:29.760\nDino and you saying the space shuttle's flying around. Right. And Dino was saying he was at the\n\n55:29.760 --> 55:33.520\ndrawing room, our little local bar. It flew right over the drawing. And I was like, what as I live,\n\n55:33.520 --> 55:38.960\nyou know, like, you know, half a mile quarter mile from there. I'm like, I didn't hear it go by.\n\n55:38.960 --> 55:43.040\nAnd so I was sitting on my toilet taking a shit as you know, as one does. And I, uh, and I hear\n\n55:46.080 --> 55:49.760\nand I was like, please let my phone be here. And I grabbed my phone, pulled the blinds up,\n\n55:49.760 --> 55:54.720\nand I have a shot I put on Instagram of the space shuttle flying over my bathroom window.\n\n55:56.240 --> 56:00.560\nI just watched it on the news. Everyone in the bar was like watching in the TV and they're\n\n56:00.560 --> 56:05.440\ngoing, it's coming. It's coming. And then they would, they would, they kept running out. I was\n\n56:05.440 --> 56:11.280\nlike, it's looked better on the TV, like way better. I don't know. No, it looked pretty cool.\n\n56:11.280 --> 56:15.120\nBut I have friends that were like on downtown. There's a cash register here now. It was really\n\n56:15.120 --> 56:19.600\nlow. They saw that thing, incredibly low. So I go because they were tooling it. I mean, I guess\n\n56:19.600 --> 56:22.960\nthat's kind of cool that they were like just showing it off. I was like, fuck you to the rest\n\n56:22.960 --> 56:26.800\nof the city is that bid to have it in their museum. And it was like, we've got your space shuttle,\n\n56:26.800 --> 56:31.680\nfucker. It was like LA going like, yeah, it's cool to be in LA. There's more here than just riots.\n\n56:31.680 --> 56:40.480\nThere's, there's, there's, there's outer space. Hey, hey, hey, black people, we may, we may expand\n\n56:40.480 --> 56:49.440\nout so much that, that you, you, you stop being the victims of crime. Okay. That was reverse\n\n56:49.440 --> 56:55.760\nrate. I was, I was being Ellen Alda about that. The, so I go back, I traipse my corpse back to the\n\n56:55.760 --> 57:02.880\ncourthouse and, and we wait again for another like hour and a half. It's like, so, so to recap here,\n\n57:02.880 --> 57:09.360\nlike the whole, like from morning to lunch, like we were just waiting and something weird happened\n\n57:09.360 --> 57:13.680\nand the bailiff just told us to fuck off and go have lunch and come back. So we all come back.\n\n57:13.680 --> 57:19.120\nSo now I've been downtown all day. I come back, we wait another hour, the bailiff comes out and\n\n57:19.120 --> 57:24.800\ngoes like, or I'm sorry, he goes, come on in guys and we all shuffle in and we knew someone was\n\n57:24.800 --> 57:30.240\nfishy because he didn't tell us like six, seven, four, go to the left. Like there was no, it was\n\n57:30.240 --> 57:35.200\njust like, get in here assholes. And so we all shuffled in and sat down and the judge was like,\n\n57:35.200 --> 57:45.360\nwell, uh, uh, Johnny, Johnny Carson, this is weird wild stuff, but you're free to go. It was,\n\n57:45.360 --> 57:51.120\nhe didn't explain anything. It was like, you're free to go. Okay. All right. It was like, what\n\n57:51.120 --> 57:56.080\nhappened yesterday? They were at the elevators and, uh, I saw one of the attorneys and they tell you\n\n57:56.080 --> 58:01.200\ndon't talk to the attorneys until after the case. And so as I said, one of them waiting for the\n\n58:01.200 --> 58:06.960\nelevator, the case is over, right? So can I ask you what happened? And, uh, and the prosecutor\n\n58:06.960 --> 58:13.600\nlooked at the DEA. Am I getting those terms right? Uh, probably assisted DEA. Uh, well, yeah, I'm\n\n58:13.600 --> 58:19.440\nsure it wasn't, uh, yeah, Sam Waterston wasn't there. Uh, I just mean the two, there were the\n\n58:19.440 --> 58:23.360\ntwo opposing attorneys and they kind of looked at each other like, as if to ask themselves like,\n\n58:23.360 --> 58:28.400\nis it okay to answer the question? And then, and then said, yeah, uh, he didn't show up.\n\n58:29.680 --> 58:34.320\nSo this, this kid who needed a translator in court cause he was like, it was like,\n\n58:34.320 --> 58:38.480\nit was a gang thing. Like he stabbed somebody and I'm assuming I'm allowed to talk about this\n\n58:38.480 --> 58:43.920\nnow. I'm not blowing the roof off of this thing. There was a stabbing and blah, blah, blah. And\n\n58:43.920 --> 58:47.600\nhe had a translator in the courtroom and the translators could only work in shifts. So there\n\n58:47.600 --> 58:51.840\nwas like always some James Carville guy walking in and trading on, like tagging out. It was the most,\n\n58:51.840 --> 58:56.800\nit was the weirdest thing in the world. This kid just sat there for a day, wasted my fucking time.\n\n58:56.800 --> 59:01.680\nDon't stab me kid if you're listening. Uh, and then the next day he was like, I'm gonna fuck this.\n\n59:02.720 --> 59:09.680\nLike he just left. He just boned out. Yeah. I guess it's what I'd do if I stabbed someone\n\n59:10.560 --> 59:14.960\nor didn't and everyone thought I did. Maybe he's, maybe he stole the space shuttle. He might have,\n\n59:14.960 --> 59:18.960\nit might have been him in the space shuttle. All right, stupid jury duty. We spent the whole\n\n59:18.960 --> 59:23.600\nnight talking about jury duty. Uh, real quick, when I was sitting in the big, like when you sit\n\n59:23.600 --> 59:26.320\nup in the gallery out there and they're saying like, who has conflicts? Who has this? And you\n\n59:26.320 --> 59:30.240\nall write it down. You hope you get kicked out. And they're going to, I have a thing. I'm going\n\n59:30.240 --> 59:35.680\nout of town as a vacation. Yeah. When are you going? Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Stay. Oh, you,\n\n59:35.680 --> 59:41.120\nyou can go. You have a, you're taking care of an elderly woman. You can leave. So people were\n\n59:41.120 --> 59:46.080\ngoing, some people were kind of on hold and she comes to me and I had all these improv show dates\n\n59:46.080 --> 59:51.200\nlike traveling around doing improv comedy. I wrote them all down. I was already contracted to go.\n\n59:51.200 --> 59:55.920\nAnd so this judge and she was kind of this tough lady and she's like, all right, Jeff Davis says,\n\n59:55.920 --> 59:58.960\nyou're going to be out of town through January this and that and that, then February, blah, blah,\n\n59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.240\nand that's, that's, that's about half of the dates and things. She's, what do you do? I go, I said,\n\n01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:10.480\ndo comedy shows. And she's like, what kind of comedy shows? Like improvisation. There's like\n\n01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.800\na hundred people in there who have interesting lines or, you know, mundane lines or whatever.\n\n01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:19.280\nAnd like, you heard a lot of, like a lot of very specific shit. This is, this is a new one. Yeah,\n\n01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.680\nit's pretty amazing. I kept recording it because I was like, shit, I work like for hours coming up\n\n01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.880\nwith, you know, people are standing up like, like, like, weird, like, so specific, you can't write\n\n01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.320\nit. And so she goes, and she goes, like, are you an actor? I go, yeah. And she goes,\n\n01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:41.440\nare you going to be famous, Mr. Davis? And I said, yes, your honor.\n\n01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.240\nAnd she goes, get out of here. Get out of here. All right. All right. That's it. Good night,\n\n01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:59.520\nfolks. Before we bring Spencer up, Adam, we were not talking to you.\n\n01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:05.600\nAll right. Adam, no, well, I asked Adam to bring his roommate here. Oh, okay. I'm sorry,\n\n01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.600\nAdam. That was probably Adam has a weird relationship with his roommate that I want to\n\n01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:15.600\nexplore. Adam has a weird relationship with me. Adam is going to bring humanity up his roommate.\n\n01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:22.960\nAnd we're going to get to the bottom of why things are so uncomfortable between us in the\n\n01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:42.880\napartment called Earth. I was in the I was in the green room with with our friend that does not\n\n01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:50.320\nexist. Documentarian Neil Berkeley. Yes. World famous. Why on the wall, he does not exist. He's\n\n01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:54.800\nnot making a movie about us going on tour. He does not exist. He's not a person that is going\n\n01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:00.000\nto be in the movie. So everything I say about it. But I wanted to talk like he was shooting me\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.360\nand he asked questions. You know, he wants information. He's like, so what do you think?\n\n01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.400\nWhat do you think you're going to do tonight or something? He's not that lame. I don't remember\n\n01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.880\nwhat he's asking me. But I was going like, yeah, well, the thing is, we were doing this and I've\n\n01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.560\nalways thought that you should do this and I want to try this. And there was a point where he said,\n\n01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:26.080\nmaybe mischaracterizing it, but this is how I perceived it. He went like, so is this how you\n\n01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:34.160\nreally talk? Is this who you really are? Like he was kind of like he's like a documentarian who's\n\n01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.960\ngoing like, wait a minute, what the fuck's going on? Are you are you always this retarded?\n\n01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:49.600\nNo, he didn't say that. I was like, is this how you talk? And I was like, I think so. I don't\n\n01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.240\nknow. I'm perfectly willing to accept that it's not. I don't know. There's a camera on me and\n\n01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:02.560\nI'm talking. And I was like, you know, you're very, very loquacious. That's all. I didn't want to\n\n01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:07.920\nthrow him into the bus. I wanted to talk about my anxieties that that causes. Right. What do you\n\n01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.280\ndo when someone asks you that? Is this how you really talk? I thought I couldn't tell what you\n\n01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.840\nwere going to say. Like he was making fun of a stammer or no, no, no, no, no. I think he meant like\n\n01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:25.120\nI was always on. Who said that? Fuck you. I'm kidding. Not fuck you. Who said that though? Oh,\n\n01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:30.560\noh, Jesus said that. That's what I thought he meant. Jesus called out always on. That's what\n\n01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.960\nI thought he meant. Like that's what I was like, I guess it's possible I may be overly conscious\n\n01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:40.320\nof the camera. I am talking after all to a camera. So I'm probably not acting completely like I\n\n01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:47.440\nnormally would. So that's what I, but I was, it threw me and it made me wonder if I'm a human\n\n01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:53.120\nbeing or not. Right. What was the verdict? I don't know. I don't have no idea. How am I supposed\n\n01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:57.040\nto know? You think I mean, eventually we're going to be, that camera is going to be up your nose\n\n01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.360\nfor almost three weeks. Yeah, and I'll get used to it. Yeah. But I don't think that was his issue.\n\n01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.680\nHe wasn't, he, because we talked about it. I was like, what the fuck? Because I'm self-obsessed.\n\n01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:11.040\nI'm like, what did you mean? Tell me everything. What did you mean? And he said, no, it's just,\n\n01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:14.640\nyou know, you're very, he said, loquacious, which is something my mom always used to call me.\n\n01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:18.720\nHow did I segue out of Adam and his roommate? I just wanted to say, talk about it.\n\n01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:24.160\nOh, okay. That was Adam. Fuck Adam. I was just saying before we bring Spencer up,\n\n01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.320\nbecause it's 9.20. I just, I was just thinking of this thing that happened before the show.\n\n01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.920\nYeah. Well, what, you know, what are you saying that I'm not normal? No, no. I think you're very\n\n01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:43.680\nnormal. I mean, I don't, I talk how I talk. It's not, so I'm just trying, I'm just trying to express\n\n01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:52.880\nmyself. And you do. I, which funny, but everybody, like, I'm nervous about the way I talk, because I\n\n01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:57.280\ntalk way too fast. I would love to talk slower. And when I listen to the podcast, I think you're\n\n01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:04.160\nway more articulate than I am, because I'm talking at a mile a minute. Yeah. We, we both have our\n\n01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:08.160\nlittle modulations of when we're talking well and talking poorly. Yeah. Tonight's a bad night for me,\n\n01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:15.040\nbut that's, that's beside the point. I disagree. I was just, I just, it made me wonder. Yeah. I've\n\n01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:22.240\njust obsessed with myself and like, I was like, Oh, do I am I, what was I, it's not important.\n\n01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.720\nI think he's just a really good documentarian. He's got under your skin. Well, yeah. Is that what\n\n01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.560\nthey're supposed to do? He's going to break you down. He's going to turn you inside out like a\n\n01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:39.440\nsock. He's really great. He's really great at that. Yeah. He's a powerful presence to have. I like,\n\n01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:43.280\nI like, I like him. It's interesting because he's not just a guy with a camera. He's like,\n\n01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.800\nhe knows what he's doing. Like he's, he has opinions about something. He's up your ass.\n\n01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.680\nHe doesn't, he's not going to, he's not, he gives no quarter to your ass.\n\n01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:57.840\nHe raped you, didn't he? He touched me. He started touching me and I was like,\n\n01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.720\nlike, what are you doing? And he's like, no, did you get in the light? And he's like,\n\n01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:05.280\ntouching my cheek. And he kind of pushed it. It's like, you look beautiful that way.\n\n01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:10.000\nAnd I was like, I don't know. Is this, I think this is the documentary. This is Neil Berkeley,\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.600\nfamous documentarian. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he doesn't, he's not shooting this thing. He's not a\n\n01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:18.720\ncharacter in it, but he was like, he's like, and then he's like, take your shirt off. And I was\n\n01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.000\ncrying. And I was like, do you understand I'm crying because you're doing this? And he's like,\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.800\nyeah, you're beautiful when you cry. And then out of nowhere, I said, I have no idea. Like,\n\n01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:35.040\nhe had a beach ball. Like, like, how do you fully inflate it, handed me a beach ball. I was just\n\n01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:39.440\nlike, no, no, no, no, play with it. Play with it. Like, what do you, what do you fuck her out at\n\n01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.560\nthe beach? Play with it. I, I, I, it was fucked up. I just wanted to talk to you about it because\n\n01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:50.240\nI'll forget about it tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. But I mean, it was a pink camera with like no lens and\n\n01:06:50.240 --> 01:07:05.840\nlike ridges. Damn, that's a dildo. Why is that too far? I don't know. You guys are customers\n\n01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:11.280\nalways right. Whatever you guys think is entertainment is up to you. But earlier, I will remind you that\n\n01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:16.480\nI said I felt someone's poop by fucking them in the butt and you were, you acted like Dean Cooke\n\n01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:24.560\nwas out here. And that you were fans of Dean Cooke. Anyways, Spencer time, Spencer time.\n\n01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.600\nSpencer, our dungeon master, extraordinary.\n\n01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:40.720\nSaunter is towards his throne with a satchel. His satchel is unfurled with the power of a million\n\n01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:46.800\nbrimlocks. I like that you're rapper. You said that you were a level three mage. What was that?\n\n01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.800\nYeah, that was which we are. We leveled up or we leveled up. So can I talk to more than one\n\n01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.440\nsquirrel a day now, Spencer? No, that's racial. It doesn't go by a level.\n\n01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:09.840\nSo Spencer, did you get off of work? Yeah, okay. I got, I got the 10th from the 31st off. So if\n\n01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:14.240\nwe're within those dates, I'm good. Otherwise, I might like have to dive out earlier. No,\n\n01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.280\n10 of the 31st puts you right. Well, there you go. Thick of things.\n\n01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.760\nSpencer will be joining us on Harmon Channel tour.\n\n01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:29.920\nJustin Marshall, our podcast producer is going to endeavor to release our podcast daily. Right.\n\n01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.760\nSo that people might follow the. So you guys won't be left out. And then we're gonna try to\n\n01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:40.720\nmake a big party happen when we come back. So we're in on the 31st of January, we're in, we're\n\n01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.440\nat sketch fest in San Francisco, which is our, no offense, Los Angeles, but you'll probably all\n\n01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:51.040\nagree because you're from Los Angeles, our favorite city, San Francisco. We love it. And\n\n01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.080\nwe were going to be there for a sketch fest and do, do our final tour show there. But then\n\n01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.200\nthen we'll be back here in LA and we're going to try to put together like a big thing. We should\n\n01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:07.920\nhave a big like homecoming. At the Wiltern. Yeah, sure. I don't know. Whatever. We'll just stack\n\n01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:15.600\nhomeless people and make a, make a stage out of them and just walk all over them and just go,\n\n01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:26.480\nit's good to be back. There were less of these in Montana. Squishy here.\n\n01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:33.840\nBut at any rate, I mean, I think we will talk about what we learned and what we, what we didn't\n\n01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:39.360\nlearn. Also, I mean, I don't imagine anybody would, but should anybody happen to see us at a gig\n\n01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.600\nthat that's here tonight or comes to our shows here, if we're out in the road, come in or dish\n\n01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.880\nyourselves. It'd be nice to see you like if. Oh, absolutely. Of course. Nice to meet any like\n\n01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.600\ntraveling Armenians that come, come meet us. Speaking of, speaking of Armenians, I saw the\n\n01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.200\nharm, the Armenian you the other day. I saw Armenian Dan Harmon. And I sing a whole song\n\n01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:04.880\nabout Armenian Harmon. Armenian Harmon. See you away from me. He looked an awful lot like you.\n\n01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:10.560\nAnd he was almost definitely Armenian. I can't imagine there's much of a line between me and\n\n01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:15.920\nArmenian me. Like, I think I could pass pretty easily for Armenian men. It's, it's, it's a hair's\n\n01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:23.520\nbreadth. Yeah. Spencer, how you doing over there? I'm doing, doing pretty, pretty good. Yeah,\n\n01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.720\nyou look like it. Thanks. Thanks. I'm always happy to see you, Spencer. You're a welcome\n\n01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:35.360\naddition here. It's good to have you. I'm glad to be enjoyed by you guys. Are you, are you ready\n\n01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:41.520\nto be in a tour bus with us for God knows how long? Yeah. I don't usually do things and that sounds\n\n01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:47.840\nlike a thing. It's a, a tour bus is a great place to do it. This is almost certainly a thing. So\n\n01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.960\nit's going to be very exciting for you. Yeah. It's a change of pace. In addition of things.\n\n01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.160\nYou'll be, you'll be doing what you normally do at 70 extra miles per hour.\n\n01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.200\nMaster baiting. Oh, the plot thickens.\n\n01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:12.960\nYeah. Dress for movement, Spencer. That is going to be a thing, isn't it? We're going to be together\n\n01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:18.240\nfor, I didn't even thought about that. I know. Yeah. We're all going to be fucking sucking on that\n\n01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:24.720\ntrip. It doesn't take long. Yeah. I'm going to watch Oz. I'm going to wear your ass like a hat,\n\n01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:35.600\nSpencer. I've seen, I've seen enough movies to know some, some shaws are going to get shanked.\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.400\nOh, wait, what did Goldberg want? Goldberg brought his roommate, I feel. Can we just,\n\n01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:47.440\ncan we sneak him up real quick? Sure. If that were possible. Is that an oxymoron?\n\n01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:50.480\nCan we sneak Adam Goldberg? Adam Goldberg, everyone. Welcome back, would you?\n\n01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:56.320\nI'm measured applause for the return of Adam Goldberg. I asked you to bring your roommate.\n\n01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.600\nAnd I asked you to bring back that plate I gave you last night. Do you have the plate?\n\n01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:05.440\nYeah, I don't. But in my, in my defense, it's a very passive aggressive move to hand someone a big\n\n01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:11.360\nheavy plate full of baked goods and then ask for the plate back when they're nowhere near their\n\n01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:19.600\nplate holding device. I actually gleefully left it like in a public restroom. I couldn't, I couldn't\n\n01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.640\nwait for you to ask for it back. So I could explain to you your 24 year old ass. No, you don't do\n\n01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:28.320\nthat Adam. You don't hand someone a big heavy plate full of baked things unless you want to kiss\n\n01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.920\nthe plate goodbye. It is defense. You gleefully leave lots of things in public restrooms.\n\n01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:40.960\nBut also not a valuable plate. I don't care. I should have taken a picture of it.\n\n01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:49.680\nA bunch of half eaten cookies and just like two brownies like upside down. That dessert trade\n\n01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:55.520\ntraveled over 80 miles by the time it got to you from beautiful Agora Hills, California.\n\n01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:01.840\nYou're a diabolical person. I brought you snacks. That's a weird way to bring the diabolical into\n\n01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:08.720\nit. It's not, but you didn't bring like a hot, like wonderful tray of home books things. You add\n\n01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:15.040\nthem. You're mad at me because I didn't bring you home cooked snacks. No, Adam. Talk to my roommate\n\n01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:28.880\nwho's a chef. Can we get a round of applause? Did you just throw to an audience intro?\n\n01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:38.880\nAll right. Adam Goldberg's roommate.\n\n01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:51.520\nHe just walked out the back door. Adam's been given a terrible latitude in an apartment\n\n01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.360\ntown. I'm not sure I'm crazy about it. Adam Goldberg's roommate.\n\n01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:01.520\nI do have a name. But I just want to say from that title alone, everyone's already on your side.\n\n01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.920\nYou're like Joan of Arc. Please welcome Hitler's therapist.\n\n01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:26.320\nWhat is your name? Anastasia. Anastasia. Ooh, prettiest name ever.\n\n01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:32.000\nI've used that a lot. It's people's middle names like in comedy writing.\n\n01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.280\nSarah Silverman's middle name and the Sarah Silverman program was Anastasia\n\n01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:40.240\nand Pierce Hawthorne on community's middle name was Pierce Anastasia Hawthorne.\n\n01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.400\nDoesn't that mean something like resurrection or something like that?\n\n01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.160\nYou know, you're one of the first people to just point that out. It's true.\n\n01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:51.760\nOh, I've read out of Karenena. What's the origin of Anastasia?\n\n01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:57.680\nIt's actually from two Greek words that mean resurrection. It's a pretty common\n\n01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.040\nGreek and Russian name, just not here. I don't know why I keep looking at my\n\n01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:05.520\nDudges and Dragons character sheet. It says you have a bag of holding.\n\n01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.480\nWe'll be right back. Not a good interviewer. I'm not good.\n\n01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.320\nIf there's an edge of the pool within reach, I will grab it.\n\n01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:25.680\nWhat's on your mind, Anastasia? What brings you up here? What brings you up on stage?\n\n01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:34.160\nIt seems to have disappeared. No, let's ask her. You have Adam Goldberg's roommate\n\n01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.080\non stage. What do we have a weird relationship with? I didn't know.\n\n01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.720\nWell, I just assumed. You know why I thought it was weird? Because you'd never been here\n\n01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:47.920\nbefore and Adam is like a regular. That's an understatement. So you would never come here.\n\n01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.880\nSo what's that about? That's not a judgment of us, right?\n\n01:15:52.880 --> 01:16:01.360\nNo, no, I can't see you guys. No, it's not that. No, my schedule is fucked up. I'm a cook,\n\n01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:07.280\nso I work when other people play, and this is usually an issue. I work on Fridays. I work\n\n01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:12.560\non Saturdays. Can we ask where you work? Yeah. We don't have to. If you don't want to say it.\n\n01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:18.480\nNo, no, no, it's cool. I used to crow about it. I worked for Wolfgang Putt catering until about\n\n01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:26.960\na month ago, and I now work at the USC Radisson. There's an upscale sports bar there called McKay's.\n\n01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:31.760\nWait, USC, meaning University of Southern California? Yes, the USC Radisson.\n\n01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.600\nYes, they do many things well. I don't think they should be managing hotels.\n\n01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:39.680\nYeah, it seems weird. That's a weird amalgam of higher education.\n\n01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:42.720\nAre you a cook or chef? Have you studied?\n\n01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:49.360\nTechnically, I'm a cook. You're not a chef unless you manage a staff.\n\n01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:54.960\nAs a technically, chefs don't really do a whole lot of cooking as a result, but go on.\n\n01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.400\nWhat's the weirdest thing you've ever caught Adam Goldberg wearing?\n\n01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.600\nYou should probably be asking me that question.\n\n01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.200\nAll right, what's the weirdest thing you've been caught wearing by Adam Goldberg?\n\n01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:14.320\nYou brought it up on a staff list. I assume that's why I was here.\n\n01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.000\nNo, you are here purely to embarrass Adam Goldberg, in my opinion.\n\n01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.360\nAll right, that's a good story. No, what was it? Yeah, what?\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.120\nAt the risk of, I don't know, I'm just starting to feel kind of naked right now,\n\n01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:36.320\nso give me a moment. Do you want me to throw something?\n\n01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.280\nI haven't ingested enough booze to be social right now.\n\n01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.680\nPour a drink. Dan, give it up. Do you drink vodka? Do you want vodka?\n\n01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:49.680\nOh, sure. After today, I could use a drink.\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.400\nToday was fucked up. You haven't been here to the show before, but I put a sharpie pen up my butt\n\n01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:04.880\nonce. And not recently, I'm getting your ice, but I just mean the bar is low as far as human\n\n01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.200\ndignity. You don't need to... Yeah, don't stick your finger in that cup. I'm good.\n\n01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:14.400\nOh, because you're a cook, you know. I'm in the red zone with my bacteria.\n\n01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:21.120\nI can get you a fresh cup and... It's cool. I've seen her. I've dealt with her story, but...\n\n01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:25.120\nHere's your ice cup. Thank you.\n\n01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:38.560\nSpencer... Wow. Dan Porter is seven ounces of vodka over my finger.\n\n01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:46.080\nAll right, but there must be an embarrassing thing I could tell you to put you at ease.\n\n01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:50.800\nOkay, it's not really embarrassing, at least not to me, but it was probably so for Adam.\n\n01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:59.280\nAnyway, I'm kind of hesitant to call this a kink. It's not really a kink. It's not really a fetish.\n\n01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:07.840\nThis is no one. Because I don't get off on it. That's the thing. But... But I may.\n\n01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:16.240\nI can't believe you don't come here every week. This is your home. This is where you belong.\n\n01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:24.560\nI'm starting to feel that way now. I'm glad. Okay, so I've been into... I can show you...\n\n01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:29.120\nWell, okay, Zen Tai for a while. Some of you might already know what that is.\n\n01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:37.920\nZen Tai? Zen Tai. Yes. Is that related to Hen Tai? No, it's not. There are a lot of\n\n01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:46.880\nsound-alike words in Japanese. This is... I'll say. Clean up your act, Asians. You've been warned.\n\n01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:52.640\nI'm like, are you actually pointing at any? I may be. Who knows? Can't throw a cat without\n\n01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:59.280\nhitting one on this side of town. Misha, you here? Misha? Hey, Misha. Oh, should I miss Misha?\n\n01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:06.080\nAnyways, what is it? What is it? All right, so they're basically head-to-toe spandex suits.\n\n01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:13.120\nOh, okay. Well, that's a cousin of... You want to come on the Harmontown Tour too?\n\n01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:19.280\nIf I could get off work for long enough, I would love to. That's the thing. I can't. I'm like...\n\n01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.880\nWhenever they're paying, we'll double it. What's up? Whenever they're paying you, we'll double it.\n\n01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.720\nI might have to take you up on that offer. Okay, I didn't think it was going to go that well.\n\n01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:35.200\nI'm like, I work in a restaurant where they're trying to make magic with seven people.\n\n01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:40.640\nNow, when you put on these little spandex suits, do you go about town? Do you wander around on the\n\n01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:47.040\nhunt? Yeah, I do. Wait, under your clothes? Or just... You mean like... Not... Well, yeah,\n\n01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:51.360\nI'm wearing clothes over them. Okay, so that's your little secret. You've got a little sexy\n\n01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.400\nspandexy outfit on. It's not really a secret if your head is covered. Yeah, it's over your face.\n\n01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.480\nYes. So do you rob banks?\n\n01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:10.000\nNo, actually. Well, you go out of the house in a full spandex head-to-toe suit. I do.\n\n01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:17.760\nAnd just go, just hit cookaroo and just walk around. Just because I feel like it. Oh, yeah,\n\n01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:21.680\ncool. Just go about your business. Pretty much. That's awesome. And what's the reaction to people\n\n01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:27.680\nthat you're running to? Strangely enough, as long as I don't make a huge deal about it,\n\n01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:34.400\nno one else does either. There are occasionally, like, I don't know, there is occasionally genuine\n\n01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:46.880\nalarm, like... Ninja! Ninja! Like, I remember ordering, like, a couple weeks ago, I ordered a\n\n01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:52.080\npumpkin spice latte from the Starbucks, the Tarzan. So you go, it's not just a stroller on the\n\n01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:57.520\nblock. Are you wearing anything else? Are you wearing anything else but just the head-to-toe\n\n01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:02.400\nspandex? Well, this is a mesh suit, so I have to wear shit under it. I mean, over it. It's mesh.\n\n01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:07.760\nYes. Okay, so you got some, you got some knickers underneath it. Something.\n\n01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.840\nFill me in here, Anastasia. This is new. I'm not, okay. Okay, so you dressed up like... I mentioned\n\n01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:20.240\nthat. I mean, I was like, I'm not going there, but... So you went to Starbucks and... Yeah,\n\n01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.720\nI'm not interested. I got some serious Googling to do tonight.\n\n01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:32.160\nBut I wear clothes over it, so I'm not like... It's A-N-A-S-T-A... Well, yeah, what is it really?\n\n01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:36.080\nI wouldn't know what it's called, because the amazing thing about that, I love that the internet,\n\n01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:44.320\nlike, like, it, like, you encounter people now, you get to go. There's gonna be, like, 500 people\n\n01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:51.120\nthat listen to you, and 40 of them are gonna go, wait, me too! And like, how do I, like,\n\n01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:57.760\nthere's a thing? There's a subreddit? So what? Yeah, I would be surprised. What's the, what's the,\n\n01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:04.880\nwould you say it's called? Zentai. And it's, look at the Z? Yes. And you're saying it's not a,\n\n01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:09.040\nnecessarily a sexual thing for you. Not for me. It seems to be for a little bit. It's kind of like,\n\n01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:14.400\nlike, comfort, like, like, maybe like a... More or less. What's the, what's the, what's the fulfillment\n\n01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:22.960\nof that for you? Like, what is that? What itch does that scratch? You put it out. It's basically a,\n\n01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:28.640\nit's either a meditative thing for me, or it's, I used to call them hug suits, because I'm like,\n\n01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:34.080\nif I'm feeling like shit, I don't know, just... Right. Feeling tightly enclosed. Like, enclosed,\n\n01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.920\nyeah. There's a thing, I have a big nylon fetish. I like, I, you haven't been here. Welcome aboard.\n\n01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:46.000\nSo you're familiar with encasement? Yes, encasement, yes. Sorry, did I call it?\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.720\nIt's related. Yes, it's like, like, if you take... Spencer, take five.\n\n01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.560\nIf you, if you, if you take, if you take nylon...\n\n01:23:52.560 --> 01:24:07.440\nIf you, if you take nylon fetishry to, to, yeah, it's like, like, you, like, like, yeah, there's people,\n\n01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.240\nlike, you, there's people who want the whole body encased in it. And I remember when I was a kid,\n\n01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:18.240\nwhen I was watching Batman, and I'm pretty convinced that Yvonne Craig, who played the\n\n01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.240\nbad girl on the Adam West Batman series, I'm pretty sure she has everything to do with everything\n\n01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:28.480\nfor me. Because she had this red wig, and she, she was like, she looked good. And, and, and\n\n01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:34.640\neveryone on that show was wearing a nylon something or spandex something. And there was also a lot of\n\n01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:42.400\nlike, like, oh, Batman, I've tied you to Robin and Batgirl again. Like, I'm gonna put you in\n\n01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.120\nthis sausage machine, and you're gonna have to, I bet you'll never get out. And no matter how hard\n\n01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:54.000\nyou wriggle, and like, I remember being a really little kid and like, watching Batman, and like,\n\n01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.400\nlike, putting myself in between a bunch of pillows and like, like, like, kind of like, like, like,\n\n01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:03.360\nwriggling around and like, feeling the comfort. And then I saw that Temple Grandin movie on HBO,\n\n01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:11.840\nwhere she, she made herself a squeeze machine. Oh, dude, that Temple Grandin movie is fucking\n\n01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:18.080\nbadass. Like, it's amazing. You got everyone asked to see it. It's the most amazing thing I've\n\n01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:28.560\never seen in my life. Period. Not as good as Batman Rising. So Batman, there's a new squeeze machine.\n\n01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:38.240\nI was wondering what it would break first, your spirit, or your body.\n\n01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:46.640\nAll right, sorry. So have we cured you of Zentai yet, Anastasia? No. But like, the, the, the idea\n\n01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:52.640\nof like, like, tight, like, yeah. Yeah. And I, there's, I think there's like, people who like,\n\n01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.120\noh, I like to wear tube socks, like, like really tight, like people, like, like, I want things\n\n01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:03.520\nsqueezing me and putting pressure on me, like, like, like, relaxes you. It's weird, but it does.\n\n01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:09.040\nI think my, I mean, I'm not, I'm not saying it's to be glib or, or, or right, but I feel like suits\n\n01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:12.960\nfor me, there's a kind of an encasement kind of thing. Like, I love the feeling of being wrapped\n\n01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.960\nup in a suit. It's like pajamas, and it's like, it's kind of like armor in a way. I feel very safe\n\n01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:24.000\nand secure in a suit. Well, we fit you pretty well, actually. Don't take that the wrong way.\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:31.440\nAll right. Well, my pants just leveled up. Trying to make Spencer back in on this matter.\n\n01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:38.320\nAll right. I'm told I have that effect. What is it? What is it? What does Adam eat by default?\n\n01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:43.840\nLike, what's, what's on his side of the fridge? Yeah. Like, no, no, what's on the coffee table?\n\n01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.720\nLike, like, like, like just empty blank wrappers. What, like, like, what does he always just eat?\n\n01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:56.080\nOh, God. I can't even answer this one of only because it's wood.\n\n01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:03.920\nAnd you're, you're afraid he'll be outed as like some kind of no, no. Nothing but neighbors.\n\n01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:08.640\nThis is like, I mean, that's how we got Adam Goldberg's roommate up here. And I don't know.\n\n01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.760\nI don't know. She's being very good. She's being more soft revelatory than, than Adam.\n\n01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.720\nNo, that's great. It's very noble of you. But, but also I want, like, what, what does he do?\n\n01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:21.280\nThere's got to be one thing. What can we do? That's never going to happen.\n\n01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:29.920\nShould I bring Eric Eitel over? And no, I, I just want, we want to tease him about one thing,\n\n01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:35.120\nlike, like one specific thing. Does he have like a porcelain bulldog that sits on his desk?\n\n01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.560\nHey, Skyfall, take it easy.\n\n01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.320\nIs he like, what does he, what does he watch? What's his favorite?\n\n01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:46.800\nI'm actually the weirder one here. I, I'm just, that's almost impossible.\n\n01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:55.600\nI mean, I'm, I'm, for God's sake, I'm a cook and I hardly ever cook. So whatever food is in the\n\n01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:02.320\nfridge is usually his. Um, he eats at this point, he eats a much more varied diet than I do. I'm\n\n01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.880\nlike, I subsist on whatever leftovers I can get from the restaurant, despite being able to afford\n\n01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:14.160\nmore than that. I just don't have time. Goldberg continues to elude us. He's normal. Oh my God.\n\n01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:18.640\nWe're going to get you. He's not normal. We're going to bring his mother up next week and she's\n\n01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.840\ngoing to be like, I don't know. I felt something down there. And then it was just, I heard a\n\n01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:30.720\nskateboard and he was gone. God damn it. I want to deal with, is he, is he Soviet? What is,\n\n01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:37.680\nwhat does he want from us? Uh, all right. Well, anything, anything, I don't know what to say.\n\n01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.160\nThis, anything you want to plug while you're up here? You get to, you get to, you've been very\n\n01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:47.520\ngracious and very revelatory. Anything you want to say to America, not America, that was,\n\n01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:50.800\nthat's presumptuous. Anything you want to say to the thousand people who was on the show?\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:52.640\n350.\n\n01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:59.120\nThat would have been my college radio DJ days. Tell your dad, you're sorry I didn't call him\n\n01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:05.760\non Father's Day or anything. Oh God. Um, God, I'm,\n\n01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:12.480\nI put you on the spot. I do. I'm a bad interviewer. No, hardly. It's just, I,\n\n01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.200\nit's something I don't really have an answer to. I'm like, anything I want America to know.\n\n01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.800\nI mean, if you had needs, you couldn't live with Adam Goldberg.\n\n01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:31.360\nWhat was mean? I go, I go where the, I go where the, you know, the pellet gives me the honey,\n\n01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.560\nyou know? I find that making fun of Adam gets me laughs. So do you, do you owe him money?\n\n01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:40.080\nDoes he have something on you? Is there some sort of weird blackmail thing going on right now?\n\n01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:44.160\nBesides what I told you about, now everyone else knows about, not really.\n\n01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.920\nAnd Starbucks, you just wanted to Starbucks. You don't care. No, no, not, not just Starbucks,\n\n01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:52.800\nHarvard. Have you and Adam, have you and Adam ever made up? No.\n\n01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:00.080\nWill they? Oh, I know you were entertaining thoughts at one point.\n\n01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:05.680\nYeah. Oh, here we go. Does he, does he, does he play video games? Does he?\n\n01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:09.920\nYeah, but how is that strange? I'm like, no, I just want to, in details,\n\n01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:14.000\ndoes he throw knives at a board? Like, like, he's home all day.\n\n01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.240\nI'm like the perfect roommate because I'm never home.\n\n01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.640\nAll right. Well, thanks, thanks, Adam. That was, that was fascinating.\n\n01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:26.080\nAnastasia. Anastasia. Anastasia.\n\n01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:34.160\nThank you so much for coming up and, and bearing your humanity to us and resurrecting\n\n01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:39.760\nAdam's character on this show. Once again. Yeah. Once you have, I said, okay,\n\n01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:43.840\nGod damn it, we really fucked up. We went too long. It's too late. No problem.\n\n01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:50.160\nAll right, Spencer. Spencer. All right, Spencer. Dungeons and Dragons, speed round. Time for a\n\n01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.400\nDungeons and Dragons. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quicky.\n\n01:30:54.400 --> 01:31:01.920\nIt's a special segment where we play Dungeons and Dragons in 10 minutes and get the fuck out of\n\n01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:07.360\nhere. Sorry. Dungeons and Dragons introduction segment. After tussling with a gelatinous cube\n\n01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:14.160\nin a pit. No, our heroes came upon a horrendous scene. A vicious barbarian raid on the White\n\n01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:20.240\nSkull Knoll village. It was here that Sharpie's father, Lord Mango Buttsalot, revealed himself,\n\n01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:26.480\nhurtling headlong at the party. Swords and spells flew as the forces clashed. But when the dust\n\n01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:31.680\nsettled, the barbarian Lord lies sleeping on the floor, suffering from a face full of magic.\n\n01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:37.040\nThere our adventurers stand in the wreckage of the White Skull Camp as dawn breaks on the\n\n01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:42.400\ngrassy hills of the Butz Peninsula. So if you recall, you're standing in the wreckage of this\n\n01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:47.200\nKnoll village, right? And he like, you knocked him out. Yeah, you're like going to draw a\n\n01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:53.200\nviolent head or something. And we took him out systematically. And now he's sleeping it off.\n\n01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:56.080\nAnd you're figuring you were you're thinking about taking his anchor.\n\n01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:03.600\nI remember. And we love he was wielding an anchor, which is awesome. Go. Speed round.\n\n01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:09.200\nLevel three. Yeah, I got a new thing called power attack. I'm excited about that.\n\n01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.240\nPower attack. I didn't say I want a power attack.\n\n01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:18.880\nAre you describing power attack? I would have if you didn't stop me.\n\n01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:25.120\nI thought just by mentioning I was going to kill the Sharpie Buttsalot by accident.\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.440\nPlease tell me. No, it's fine. The moment's gone. We'll come back to it. Oh, shit.\n\n01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:36.960\nAs Lord Buttsalot sleeps on the floor, you notice several barbarian warriors suddenly creep out of\n\n01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:46.400\nhiding. Oh, shit. Power attack. They seem weary. Oh, wait. McGathey's Friman, Friman Summonen's\n\n01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:54.800\ncinnamon must say cinnamon mustache. Sorry, Aaron. Can you can you can you can you play your character?\n\n01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:58.400\nSpeed come up. I'm sorry. I am the guy.\n\n01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:06.800\nMcGathey, everybody. As Malorean Sedona, which Vace Panos tells me, Sedona is Armenian for Satan.\n\n01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:14.640\nI love cinnamon mustache. All right, sorry, sorry. So is that where somebody shits in your chest?\n\n01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:21.760\nThere's barbarians coming out of the out of the bushes. They seem weary and relieved.\n\n01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:31.600\nThey approach you calling out. Hey, hey. Hey, easy with the magic. Hey, man, only using as much as I\n\n01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.800\nhave to. Thanks for knocking out our war chief. He gets kind of crazy, you know, when he's raging.\n\n01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.120\nHey, listen, how's it going? How's it going? You should have been to dinner on Tuesday nights.\n\n01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:47.840\nI'm his son. Sharpie, Sharpie Buttsalot. Sharpie Buttsalot. Nice to meet you. I am\n\n01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.080\nlive by Leonard. We've actually met before. Oh, right. Yeah, just an ages past. Well, I was a little drunk.\n\n01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:59.360\nWell, so you guys. Yeah. I'm talking to the barbarians.\n\n01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.080\nSo you're you're you're I came to I came to stop you because you're headed for the\n\n01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:14.960\nyou're headed to talk to the dwarves, right? No, see, that was just a clever ruse to throw them\n\n01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:18.480\noff our trail. We really came here to this no village to wipe it out.\n\n01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:27.280\nYeah, the plot thickens. Damn, I can't keep up with this shit. And I also have to confess,\n\n01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:35.280\nI've never single thing on any of these. Never ever. Like sometimes we're up against the wall\n\n01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:47.520\nand I'll go like a snake handler. And I get lucky. But we're level three now. So I'm gonna try to\n\n01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:50.960\nbut these are these are ostensibly people who were on their side because this is these\n\n01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.120\nthese are friends of your sleeping father, right? These are my peeps. Yeah, those are your peeps\n\n01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:02.960\nostensibly ostensibly. I asked these barbarians as a barbarian myself. I greet them with my\n\n01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:09.680\nwith with the old barbarian handshake. All right. For the podcast listeners, Jeff is giving a very\n\n01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:14.880\nelaborate handshake, right? For the package, specifically, you you the first person on the\n\n01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.840\nleft holds their hands together as if in prayer. The other person does the same and holds their\n\n01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:27.600\nhands 90 degrees, right? And they they bisect each other's fingers, and then look through each other's\n\n01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:38.960\nhands and chuckle. It's a goodie. Yes, yes, we did expect you. You see, Yerch, he was here before\n\n01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:51.120\nhe told us you'd be coming. Aha. Well, we're here. Again, thank you for killing or not killing our\n\n01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:56.800\nbarbarian Lord. Please don't loot his body. It's important to us. So hey, it couldn't be more\n\n01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:05.200\nimportant to me. I mean, he came me. Now, when he wakes, when he wakes up, is that what do we how\n\n01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:09.040\ndo we get him on our side? Will he wake up in a better mood? Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was raging,\n\n01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.360\nyou know, he was drunk. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was drunk. I'm trying to wrap my mind around and I'm\n\n01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:23.120\nso sorry. I ask questions. It's fine. You guys weren't headed towards any dwarves at all. No,\n\n01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:28.320\nyou see, the dwarves are our enemies, but that was not the intention of this mission. Oh, that's\n\n01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.160\nwhat you told everyone you were going to go do, and then you're going to go on a secret assassination\n\n01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:35.840\nmission. We were really looking for something. Well, what's going down with the dwarves? I'm\n\n01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:41.280\ndistressed by all this talk. I mean, forever, human and dwarf have been inextricably bound\n\n01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:51.120\nby humanoidness. I have no problems with dwarves per se, but the Hammerbeard tribe themselves,\n\n01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:56.640\nthey're very warlike. They're martial. They're not normal dwarves. They've been trying to overtake\n\n01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:04.000\nthese planes for years. You said they're bad dwarves. Yeah, I'd say so. Take your word for it.\n\n01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.880\nYou said you were here to find something. What were you specifically here to find? You see,\n\n01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:14.000\nthat's actually classified. I think only Mango knows. Let's wake him up. Yeah, you want to wake\n\n01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.120\nhim up? I grabbed some water from a nearby well and splashed it on his face. You splashed it on his\n\n01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:28.320\nface. He wakes up with a start. What? Sharpie, sharpie, it's you. What are you doing here?\n\n01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:43.120\nI... Happy Father's Day. I want my cake. What if I'm... What are you doing here? I came to visit\n\n01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:48.320\nyou. I was out in the field and I was trying to work up my mage powers and I had an epiphany that\n\n01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:54.000\nI should come in a tone with you. Finally come to take a run at your old man, hey? That's very brave.\n\n01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.120\nNo, brah. No. Dad, I'm not going to take a run at you. You're a barbarian. I just wanted to be\n\n01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:11.440\na wizard. Like, I came to take a run at your feelings. Your words strike a chord and his\n\n01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:21.200\nface softens. He says, you know, back when I used to beat you. It was because I thought magic would\n\n01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:32.400\nmake you weak. But now I realize magic is strength. Magic is the universe. I shunned magic. But now\n\n01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:39.280\nI realize magic is power. It binds my tribe and crushes my enemies underfoot. And that's why I've\n\n01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.920\nbeen pursuing these fragments. Perhaps you've heard of them. They're called the Fragments of Power.\n\n01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:50.720\nDon't we have one of those fragments? I whisper to Sharpie.\n\n01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:05.840\nIt's kind of an Abbott and Costello kind of... I think we have two of them. Dad, I think we have\n\n01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:11.200\ntwo of them. You think? Fragments. Well, we had one and then... Don't lie to your father, Sharpie.\n\n01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:20.320\nWell, I just can't keep track. Dad, I'm an alcoholic. And often our adventures occur\n\n01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:27.040\nlate in the evening when I've crossed a threshold. We'll show them to me. I pull out my dick and\n\n01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:36.640\nballs. And then I say, just kidding. Not those fragments. We had two fragments, right? We had\n\n01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.080\nthe one that we got from the... The one that you had and the one you stole from Darkstar, yeah.\n\n01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:48.960\nYeah. I pull them out. You whip them out. He inspects the dazzling crystals. He says,\n\n01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:53.680\nyes, yes, these will do nicely. And he takes them from you. Well, what dad? Do you want to...\n\n01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:57.200\nOkay, I'm sorry. He attempts to take them from you. And I go, ah, whoa.\n\n01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:04.480\nYou were just... He just rolled the dice? You're much quicker than him and pull the\n\n01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:09.280\nthe stones back. His face contorts with rage. I jump in front of Sharpie and say,\n\n01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.640\nlisten, we just met you and I know you're his father, but if you want what we've fought so\n\n01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:20.800\nhard to gain, we will exact a price for them. Jesus. He looks at you with a new understanding\n\n01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:26.080\nand then you see behind him approaching. Yerch, the gnoll. He's slinking up. He's holding a haunch\n\n01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:33.120\nof meat and he's munching on it. A haunch of what? Of meat. A haunch of... I ask him if he likes his\n\n01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:41.520\nwhat is eating. Yes, yes, he does. On closer inspection, you realize it's the leg of a gnoll.\n\n01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:48.400\nOh, I take an arrow and I shoot it at his shoe, so it just hits the shoe into the ground,\n\n01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:56.080\nbut not his foot. The severed foot or his personal foot, the one he owned. His personal foot,\n\n01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:01.360\nbut I don't hurt him. I just keep him. Like a bug that I'm tax-curing. Ben,\n\n01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:06.800\nsir, did you give me a power attack to use on Mulrainee Sidhanna? Because I'm fucking this close.\n\n01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:12.800\nYou guys make the action, I mean. Okay, so you shoot at his foot, at his foot, or near his foot.\n\n01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:20.320\nJust to keep him. It seems like the right thing to do. Well, it does miss. He looks at you with\n\n01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:25.520\nanger. He approaches mango without you guys talking. He approaches mango and they turn\n\n01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:28.880\ntheir backs to you and whisper to one another. You see him pull something out of his pocket.\n\n01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:32.880\nIt looks kind of like your crystal, but it's a deep blood red. He hands it to him.\n\n01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:40.560\nDad, listen, you said that you have a newfound respect for magic, so I would hope that that\n\n01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:46.880\nwould be a entree into a newfound respect for your son's vocation and a newfound respect for\n\n01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:52.400\nthe potential destruction that magic can cause. These two shards that we've uncovered,\n\n01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:58.320\nyou know, we got them from shitty people who were corrupted by their power and, you know,\n\n01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.440\nwe just need to make sure, I'm all four gathering all of them, to keep them out of the hands of\n\n01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:12.560\nthe shitty. So let's not get all grabby. He seems a bit calmed by your speech, you know. You always\n\n01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:17.840\nhad a way to convince him sometimes. What happens if you combine all these shards together? What\n\n01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:24.000\nis the force that that creates? You see the fragments of power about fragments of the tapestry\n\n01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:32.720\nof fate. You can imagine the universe as the reflection of the light. That light is magic.\n\n01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:37.760\nThe light comes through the tapestry of fate and projects our reality. But these\n\n01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:43.040\nforge, they determine what the reality is. With the fragments in hand, one can determine\n\n01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:48.160\nwhatever reality they wish and will it into being. We can change the tapestry with the\n\n01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:54.640\nshards? With the fragments of power, you are the tapestry. Now do we have three of the four or\n\n01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.960\nall four now? You guys personally have two. One of them's the one you found and one of them's a\n\n01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:04.160\npretty large one that you purified from the Admiral Darkstar. You saw that red one, maybe.\n\n01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.480\nSo that's probably number three. Yeah, he might have other ones he hasn't told you about. I'll\n\n01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:14.320\ncarry it because I'm very strong. Which one? The large one. You'd have to ask Sharpie for that.\n\n01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:20.880\nHe owns it right now. You can carry it. I was just trying to help. Yeah, that's fine. I say that we\n\n01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:25.520\ncombine these three. Look Sharpie, I pull Sharpie and Mulrainee aside and say like, here's the deal.\n\n01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:28.560\nWe don't know what's going to happen when all four of these are together and who's going to control\n\n01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:33.680\nthem. But I say at least let's make sure that we as good people are involved when the four are\n\n01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:38.240\nunited and we can cross that bridge and we come to it. Let's unite these three and then go after\n\n01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:45.440\nthe fourth one together. Right, but first we've got to purify this red one. Dad, your crystal,\n\n01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:53.040\nyour shards, red. I don't think it's supposed to be. What do you know of these stones? Have you\n\n01:43:53.040 --> 01:44:00.960\nstudied them? Well, I've got some hands on experience. I've taken two of them and I think\n\n01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:09.200\nI purified one of them. I was, again, very drunk. I'm not coming to you as a proud man, Dad. I'm\n\n01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:16.160\ncoming to you as a guy with two shards and I'm saying yours is red and I think that when there\n\n01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:27.760\nare different colors they should be purified. None of you. Take it easy. If I've learned\n\n01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:36.000\none thing on this adventure, different colors should be purified. Can I try to purify your red\n\n01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:44.800\ncrystal, Dad? I don't know what this purification process might do. Do you know what this is?\n\n01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:49.600\nWell, it ain't going to make them less magical. Do you know that? Yes.\n\n01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:59.520\nYou say reasonably unconvincingly. Oh, you convince them.\n\n01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:03.920\nOkay.\n\n01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:11.920\nI thought it was climatic and unclimatic at the same time. Oh, yeah, you fucking nailed it.\n\n01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:19.040\nBut you know, you fucking did it. That's how it goes. He hands you the red crystal. Did I\n\n01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:24.080\npurify the last one? Yeah, but you don't know what that means. I mean, you haven't like done\n\n01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:29.920\ntests on an unpurified versus a purified. Yeah, but I can't, what did I do last time to remember\n\n01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.840\nwhen we got you touched them together and one of them turned from like dark colored to like bright\n\n01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:40.480\ndad. Oh, okay. That's really all you know. I turned my back and I go home. I just put the three\n\n01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:48.960\ntogether. Is that from Temple of Doom? No, it's from gibberish. Okay. You notice the red one\n\n01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:56.240\nglows and it actually turns the larger one red. Oh, let's just hope that red is good.\n\n01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:59.680\nLet's commit to this. Maybe red's good.\n\n01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:09.280\nDoesn't sound good. May I use Alchemist's fire to examine the color of the stones?\n\n01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:14.080\nAlchemist's fire is a magical bag containing reagents that when exposed to air burst into\n\n01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:19.920\nflame. It's essentially an ascendiary device. All right, sorry. Why don't you shoot more arrows\n\n01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:26.400\nat people's feet? Why did you do that? Did you think he was going to eat a chicken leg?\n\n01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:32.320\nShe just knows she has arrows and she keeps shooting them all the time with people.\n\n01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:35.280\nNo, I thought he was going to run away, so I just wanted to keep him still.\n\n01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:40.320\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry. Adventure.\n\n01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:48.160\nSure, don't tell. Mango calls. What's good? What's going on? You took my thing.\n\n01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:54.880\nI was just doing a thing. So what happened? The red one turned another one red?\n\n01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:59.120\nYeah. So we have one purified one and two red ones? Yes. So I think it's probably dangerous\n\n01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:03.680\nto combine all three of these together. It might very well be. I said we find the fourth one and\n\n01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:10.480\nmaybe there might very well be more than four. Can I rate Ranger for the fourth one? Ranger.\n\n01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:20.400\nHere. You range unsuccessfully. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm sorry.\n\n01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.720\nI throw one of my seven knives at the moon.\n\n01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.480\nIt can't hurt to try.\n\n01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:42.240\nAll right. Dad. What would you think about taking these things to someone that would\n\n01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:50.800\nknow better than us what their potential dangers are? You want to know what their potential dangers\n\n01:47:50.800 --> 01:48:03.280\nare? Check this out. He grabs his red crystal from your hand and he swallows it. Nothing happens.\n\n01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:14.240\nNothing. Nothing happens. This is true power. All right. Swallow your red one. This is why I\n\n01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:27.680\nleft home. I never said he was sane. He might be crazy. Dad, is that the first time you've\n\n01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:34.400\never done that? No, no. This is my third. You've swallowed the second one's the hardest. Oh,\n\n01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:39.840\nso he's got one more inside him already. He's two more. Two more. He's the third one he swallowed.\n\n01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:47.040\nSo, okay. So, Dad, what can you do having swallowed this? Soon. Soon you'll see.\n\n01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.840\nAre we supposed to cut him open and get those things? That's a lot. How much do you\n\n01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:56.320\npair? He presents his belly. He presents his belly. That's a joke. I could use,\n\n01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:01.760\ncould I use my arrow to do surgery that's painless and then? Yeah, yeah, you're totally. That's,\n\n01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:09.520\nwhat's your surgery rating? That's heel skill. Heel skill? I think you're like a\n\n01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:18.320\nplus nine to heal. Dad, I'm really taken aback by your behavior. I'm not surprised. You know nothing\n\n01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:22.640\nof the fragments. You know nothing of the tapestry. You know nothing of true magic. Can we get the\n\n01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:26.960\nfellowship of the nerds up here to help us out and tell us what to do? Yeah, I know. I know a\n\n01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:31.920\ncorruptive magic when I see it. So, but he's not trying to go for my fragments, right? I thought\n\n01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:39.280\nI might too. Not yet. Although he does occasionally eye them. Yes. I've seen this before. Swallow\n\n01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.520\nyours too and then it'll be as equal. It'll be like a toning with them. No, I'll just have two\n\n01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:50.000\nfucking unused fragments and like, he'll kill me. I don't know what to do. This seems like a great.\n\n01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.880\nOh, he said detect magic. Detect a magic. You have two stones, one that's purified and one that's\n\n01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:02.320\nnot purified. So why don't you detect magic and see which is stronger?\n\n01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:14.000\nIt's a luan that she uses. What does detect magic detect? Detect magic allows you to see\n\n01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.800\nauras emanating out of things that are magical. As you focus harder, those auras become more\n\n01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:24.480\ndistinct and determine the nature of such magic. Can I tell something that's more magical from\n\n01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:30.560\nsomething that's less magical? Yes. Okay. Because this guy's a hero. Listen to that guy. I will\n\n01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:41.200\ndetect, cast Detect Magic on my dead stomach and on the shards in my hands. You sense several auras\n\n01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:48.320\nof magic. One's coming from the stone in your hand. One's coming from the larger stone that's\n\n01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:56.080\nbeen turned red now. A huge auras emanating out of Lord Buttsalot and a sizable auras emanating from\n\n01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:09.280\nJeff's pocket. Well, that we knew about. You know what I'm saying about a gnome with a big sword.\n\n01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:16.080\nYou notice Lord Buttsalot is emanating a magic of intense chaos and anger and power.\n\n01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:20.240\nWell, I have magic too. Yeah, you can't see it though, Sue. I mean,\n\n01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:22.800\nunless he says something to you, you have no idea this is happening.\n\n01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:31.840\nAll right. I'm going into the panic mode. So what's next, Dad? Where were you headed next?\n\n01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:37.920\nWe take this fight to the dwarves. You see, the dwarves have fragments too. They want ours. We\n\n01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:42.560\nneed to wipe them out before they finish their war plans and decimate my lands.\n\n01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:48.960\nWhere do you think they are? The dwarves, the mountains that they live in. You see, they're\n\n01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:57.280\nusing dwarves like mountains. Yeah, no, I know they do. Do I know that I have an emanating\n\n01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:06.720\nthing? Okay, sorry, sorry, Jeff. Uh, uh, shit. Well, I mean, we were the shows way too late.\n\n01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:13.600\nWe're missing a piece. Uh, what? There are pieces in existence. You have a few of them.\n\n01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:17.440\nSo right now are we trying to are we trying to find a missing piece or we're trying to\n\n01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:20.720\nfigure out what's happening? You're talking to your dad or you're talking to his dad.\n\n01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:24.480\nHe seems to want to get the ones from the dwarves or maybe just kill the dwarves.\n\n01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:28.160\nLet's unite forces and kill the dwarves and combine these shards together.\n\n01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:37.920\nYes, a barbarian after my own heart. Two arrows. Two arrows at the dwarves. Two arrows well\n\n01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:45.760\nserved. Wait, is she just trying to kill me? No, no, no, at the dwarves. Oh, you keep shooting\n\n01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:51.280\narrows at everything. You just said kill the dwarves and I, yes, Anna do and said, yeah,\n\n01:52:51.280 --> 01:53:00.880\nlet's kill the dwarves. Okay. How do I please you? It's a very good question. How many arrows?\n\n01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:07.520\nHi. Okay. All right. I just once bitten twice shy. We've never gone this late. We have to find a\n\n01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:14.640\nplace to stop the show, but it's, I say that you make a big proclamation to, to me, to Mulraine,\n\n01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:21.760\nand to your, to Lord Buttsalot about what, about like, just like Peter Jackson's breaking up the\n\n01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:27.600\nhobbit and to Shariax, I say you find a way to end this non act break in a great flourish\n\n01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:31.920\nin a way that you would end, you would break up the hobbit into one third.\n\n01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:37.280\nRight. And then as I recall from the Lord of the Rings, the thing that one character did was,\n\n01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:43.440\ndid you ever notice when it seems like a story is bad that it actually turns out it's good?\n\n01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:47.920\nBecause there'll be another story. And then the other guy was like, yeah, I guess you're right.\n\n01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:53.840\nAnd then they ended the movie. That was how the, but we can't do that here. More craftsmanship.\n\n01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:54.960\nI just did it. It didn't work.\n\n01:53:54.960 --> 01:54:14.240\nWe want to thank Spencer all for being up here. Thank you, Spencer. Yeah, come on.\n\n01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:20.960\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Erin McAfee, Mulraine Sedona, thank you for being here.\n\n01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:28.160\nCrystal Shards. Crystal Shards got power. Power going down to the hour. Got a fragment of this,\n\n01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:34.400\ngot a fragment of that. Fuck your mama's dog. Fuck your mama's cat.

Fuck your mama\n\n01:54:52.960 --> 01:55:00.880\nin the grains. Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody. Sorry, sorry, a little, kind of a\n\n01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:10.640\nlong one.
