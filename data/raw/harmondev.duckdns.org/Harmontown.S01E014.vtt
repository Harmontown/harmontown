WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Yeah, latest show.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
As the groovy, funky, Swedish strains of ace of bass

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
gently wash over your cerebral cortexes,

00:28.000 --> 00:39.000
please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
I think he's seamless, seamless opening tonight.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
For those of you listening in podcast land,

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
there's a 15 minute ordeal trying to get that ace of bass

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
song queued up, had to go to the mayor's iPod.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I think we do that from now on.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
We're using your iPod for ace of bass,

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
but I say from now on, if people in the crowd have a good song,

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
we kick it off with that one.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Until we get sued.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Someone will come in with a Chevy Chase voicemail on their phone

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
and say, open with us.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
You got my phone back?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Oh, shit.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
So welcome.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I would like to thank Jeff Davis for controlling tonight,

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
as he always does.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I have some notes.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I want to apologize.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
For those of you, I assume that if you're coming here

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
and you're laying $10 on the barrel head,

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
then that means that you're probably a Harmontown podcast

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
subscriber.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
And that means that you're probably very upset.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
The last couple of weeks, there has been no new

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Harmontown podcast.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
We're two weeks behind.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I was in North Carolina with Erin.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
Her little brother was getting married in what unfolded

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
into very awkward turn of events, which I may discuss

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
momentarily.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm just looking at my phone here.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I have my Evernote app loaded up.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Things tagged Harmontown.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Some of them are mild complaints that I have.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Some little observations.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Perhaps a pied-de-terre.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
No, that's not an expression that means an apartment.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Sometimes you just throw a three-word French phrase

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
into things to just give a little joie de vivre

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
to a little je ne sais quoi.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Here's a complaint.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
We had some good luck with me complaining about things.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I didn't think that complaining was charismatic,

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
but we had a good time.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
We were complaining about things that I have no right

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
to complain about.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Some would call that a segment of our show.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
My mustache is too absorbent.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I have to trim it.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
I was out of town for 12 days, and I had no trimmer with me.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
It really soaks up quite a bit of vodka, milkshakes,

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
whatever happened to be going into my mouth.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
You don't feel it, because I don't have any nerve endings

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
in my mustache.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
I wish cats do.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
I don't use my mustache to detect the width of openings

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I want to get through.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Is the bummer for you that you're being robbed of vodka

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
and milkshakes?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
That's where that went.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
That's why I'm still sober.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
It's all in my damn mustache.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
No, the bummer is...

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I have no feeling up there.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
If I'm drinking vodka for a while, for instance,

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
just as a crazy hypothetical,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I can't feel it, so it just feels normal.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
But then, if I go to kiss Erin on the head or something,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
it's like a sponge.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
All of a sudden, there's just liquid everywhere all over her head.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
She doesn't complain about it.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
I guess it's nice, because then she smells like vodka.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
I don't know, but I guess there's nothing wrong with it.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Maybe I'll cross that off my complaint list.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Maybe that goes into a bragging column.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Mustache absorption.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
But I trimmed it now, and it's fine.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Moving on.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Any more complaints in here?

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Let's see here.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
Well, here's a couple things.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Last time I did this segment where I complained about things

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I'm not allowed to complain about,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I started talking about airports,

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
because I wanted to get to this one thing I never got to.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
They have these stupid machines.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I talked about this yesterday.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I went there yesterday at the thing, the podcast festival.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
Your girlfriend and our producer.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
There's one guy who raised his hand.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Bummer for you.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I'm just going to say everything again.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
What's up with this Tyler Perry guy?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm making that up.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
What is up with this Tyler Perry guy?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I've never seen him in anything.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I don't know.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
He's now in a movie.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I don't know anything about Tyler Perry.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
I saw the first, I think the first breakout, his clerks.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
What was it called?

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Medea Diary of a Mad Black Woman, I think it was.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
I don't know.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Since then there's been several.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Medea has become the black Ernest.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
She goes to camp.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
She goes to prison.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
She goes to hell.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
She goes to outer space.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
She saves Christmas.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Does she really?

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
One of those is true.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I swear to God, I don't know which one,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
but I know one of them is true.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
She has either saved Christmas or gone to prison.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
No, I think both.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Didn't Medea save Christmas?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
No?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
She's gone to prison.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
She's gone to prison for sure.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
But did she save Christmas?

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Auntie?

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
You can't just ask the one black audience.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
I did it as a joke.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
I knew he didn't know.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
I bet he does.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I bet he does.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Auntie don't know nothing about no Tyler Perry.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
Auntie don't truck with no Tyler.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I was saying to Aaron in the car on the way over

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
because we drove past one of his billboards.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
It must have been rough if you were Tyler Perry's roommate.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
You know there's a lot of post-it notes in that fridge.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Get it?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
No?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Probably labels everything, you know,

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
when his name is the...

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
A guy gave a thumbs down and now is flipping me off.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
And he's wearing like a...

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
It's like a poncho polo shirt with a hood.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Now he put the hood up because he's gangster.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
I don't know what to make of you, sir.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
He gave you thumbs up and then flipped you off?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
No, he gave me thumbs down.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
And then I made eye contact with him

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
and then he just started flipping me the finger.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
This crowd is crazy.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Harmontown's crazy.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Okay, so I don't know where to begin.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Tyler Perry...

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Boy, that landed on its ass.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Hang on.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
So you were saying that Tyler Perry would say

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
this is Tyler Perry's mustard or Tyler Perry's...

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah, it's funny.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
It was too much of a dot connector.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
You know who probably loved that?

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Adam Goldberg probably loved that.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
It was an ass burger joke.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Or as you call it, ass burgers.

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
Adam Goldberg just hangs out now, which is fine, I guess.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
He's a weirdo.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
He's a lovable weirdo.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
I'm a misfit.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Harmontown is about founding a colony of misfits.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Adam Goldberg should have some kind of statue of him somewhere

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
on the moon if we get there.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
But he was hanging out.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
He just popped by the drawing room, our watering hole,

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
and we were hanging out with Eric Idle from Monty Python fame.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
I had to list his credits.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Eric Idle from Monty Python.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
From European vacation.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
Jeff is friends with this comedy icon legend,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
and we were hanging out with him at our local watering hole,

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
and Adam Goldberg was there.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
So we ended up at my house hanging out,

08:17.000 --> 08:24.000
and Adam Goldberg was leaving the house at the same time as Eric Idle,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
and we were like, ah, everybody, goodnight, goodnight everybody, goodnight.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
And Adam turned to Eric Idle and said, hey, it was really nice to meet you.

08:30.000 --> 08:38.000
Do you have a card?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Wait, he just kind of...

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
He just stormed the stage.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
He just stormed the stage.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
I think there's something to be mined from the encounter

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
with what I thought was just a cool old British dude.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
I didn't come here in June to be like,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I'm going to involve myself in Dan Harmon's life,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
but now that I'm...

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
He just stormed the stage and grabbed a microphone.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I've been impugned, Jeff.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
It's a quirky story about you.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Did you deny any part of that story?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Let's flash back.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I have spent...

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Because I can kind of show the tapestry

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
of what you've accused of Asperginess.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
I would much prefer, if we said the word personality,

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I'd like to think that all the social awkwardness is earned

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
rather than diagnosed, which is the only reason I've said,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
I don't have Aspergers on all the various shows

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
where I have defended not having Aspergers.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
So...

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
What do you have?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I'd like to say a great personality

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
which is treated to medication.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
What do you... what do you... what, Ritalin?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Okay, yeah, yeah.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Can I have some?

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah, sure. We'll talk later.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I'm not going to...

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
This is going to be the first live drug deal via podcast.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
You know, Season 2 of Community,

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
heard of it?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Yeah.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Adderall, baby.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Chewing it like candy.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
It's the candy that lets you focus.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
I can say it now. Let that go down for my biopic.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
That was the Johnny Cashier.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I don't think you're a fool on anybody.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Holy smokes.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Dan, have a seat.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Have a seat?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Yeah, let this guy take all.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
This is him.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Adam Goldberg!

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Goldberg Town.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
It's time for us to the regular segment of Harmontown

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
called Goldbergia.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Goldberg, Berg.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
No one online got any of that.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
They should have put their money on the barrel,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
put it in the incinerator.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
So, it's Wednesday night, a few weeks ago.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
I'm killing it.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I'm killing it in the exposition.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I'm killing it.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I go down to House of Pies for a Meetup.com

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
inspired game of Cards Against Humanity.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
And Pies.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I met the creators of that game.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah, they're going to love that cheap plug.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to derail you.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
No, it's a conversation.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I'm not an oddity. I'm a weirdo.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
You can touch the display animal or whatever this is.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Nobody feels sorry for you.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Thank God, because that would take a long time.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
So, I go over to the drawing room.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
I'm like, House of Pies does not serve liquor

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
all they shouldn't.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Go over there.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
And I see Jeff chatting with our dear friend Kate

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
and the cool...

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Yes, please.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Just for the sake of...

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Jeff went to get a drink for himself.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
And Adam, who doesn't have Asperger's at all,

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
somehow interpreted Jeff getting a drink as an offer.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Sure thing, Mr. Goldberg.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Offer to get him a drink.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Oh, you've Tyler parryized it now.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Oh, my God.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
You're a tire, sir.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Thank you, Hope.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
All right, so you're at House of Pies.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I was like, I need to drink some liquor

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
to balance out the good decisions

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
I've been making all night, playing four hours of an offensive card game.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Go over there.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
I meet Jeff, meet some of our good friends over there.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
And it's his birthday.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
It was here, birthday celebration.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Pre-birthday, yeah.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
And there was the coolest British guy I've ever half-talked to

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
because couldn't really hear much of anything at the bar.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I think he introduced himself and said,

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
my name is...

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I was like, that's great.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
I'll wait until someone uses it in conversation later,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
which never happened.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
So after impressing...

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
This is the thing, this is the angle you're playing where you...

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I didn't know shit.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
You didn't know it was Eric Eidel the whole night.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Which is, that looks bad on me.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
I'll admit, that was a mistake.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I think it's, I don't think it's true.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
I know, I just thought, you were dead.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Did it seem like I knew what was...

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
It never seems like you know what's going on.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Oh yeah, you seem so irrationally impolite.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Like you couldn't pick up on social cues.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
So you must not have known who I was

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
or like you were just being yourself in meeting Eric Eidel.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
At what point you pulled out your phone

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
and started reading at the top of your lungs

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
an anti-war poem off of your phone.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
One, it was a loud slam poetry voice.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Two, I am normally loud anyway, so that's hard to distinguish.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Eric Eidel like...

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
He really liked that poem.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I know, I remember looking over at Eric Eidel,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
he had his head bowed and he was just nodding,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
listening to it like he was in a beat, like a poetry slam.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
I like to think that one of the rudels also liked that poem.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
I would like to think that my 10-year-old self

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
could randomly look through a portal

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
and see me sitting in a living room

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
with a guy on a velvet couch looking at a hologram phone

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
going, but my war is not your war, brother.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Screaming at the top of his lungs with Eric Eidel

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
nodding his head in the corner.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
That's the only glimpse you get of your 39-year-old life, Dan Harbin.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
You know who the ruddles are, but you don't know Eric Eidel.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
I would recognize him much more.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It was a mistake on my part,

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
but to think all older Englishmen look like Eric Eidel

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
is equally biased.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
I think that when I started laughing at you,

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
you asked him for his card.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
I said he doesn't have a card, he's Eric Eidel.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
That's when I knew him as Eric Eidel.

14:45.000 --> 14:52.000
And then you went, oh, oh, not by virtue of a natural ability

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
to pick up on it through empathy,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
but now because it's been pronounced.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
I've misstepped, and then you texted Aaron and said,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
sorry about that, I didn't know he was Eric Eidel all night.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I'm going to go ahead and call.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
My theory is that that's a little damage-control

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Goldbergian horseshitery.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
And everyone's going, oh, Adam Goldberg's anything,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
if not honest, like he's an honest person.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
You got Aaron's phone number,

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
so you could send her that text.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
The way you got her phone number was by saying,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
hey, Aaron, I was there when you did this.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
He said, hey, Aaron, I lost my phone.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
My phone broke.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I didn't go, what was your number again?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
And she gave it to you, and then we walked away.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
She's like, he never had my number.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Both true, both true.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
You're a diabolical...

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
And I lost my phone.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
You're diabolical.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
Hey, I think it's just been a long con,

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
this whole personality thing that you've been faking,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
just to slowly take over Harmontown.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
He's not an unintelligent man, obviously.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
We know that. Who's to say he's not evil?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Like, he could be...

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
We don't know, we don't know.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
He's out on Adam Goldberg.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I have no rejoinder to defend myself from the accusation

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
of being scheming and evil,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
but I'd like to defend and say that

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
your accusation of me being competent

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
is far afield.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
What sort of incompetent making me make you a drink?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I thought you were...

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
You're much taller than me.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I don't know if you can tell on podcast land,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Jeff has about three or four vertical feet on me.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
And horizontal, if you know what I'm talking about.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
You have a three-foot dick.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Three-foot four inches.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
You just look like a T-square.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Adam, as long as you're up here,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
the last time you were up on stage,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I was in a blackout drunk,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I heard the recording of it,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
and I have some questions, including,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
what's wrong with your spine?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
That's just muscular...

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
That's a mixture of long-term muscular dystrophy,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
which I'm going to fall victim to in 30 years,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
and a little bit of scoliosis.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I didn't know you could make...

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
You're not allowed to pity me.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
That's the rule. We fucking are.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
How does muscular dystrophy work?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
A muscular dystrophy is a process

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
where eventually you lose nerve tissue,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
you lose muscle tissue

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
in a way that it doesn't regenerate.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Eventually you lose a lot of lower body function.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
In severe cases, you just can't use your muscles.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
So you know that you have it?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I know that it's hereditary,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
and my dad has it pretty bad.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
It's in the car.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Is it a thing that comes on, like diabetes,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
like you don't have it now,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
but you're just saying you're highly at risk for it?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I'm at risk for it.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
In that, just being in front of a monitor

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
for the past 14 years.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
And then there's just scoliosis thrown into boot,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
like a little garnish.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
I got the real, you know, the 2-7 offsuit.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Just to make sure your spine doesn't make it through the gauntlet.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
It looks like a question mark,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
and the question is,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
how did Adam miss that social cue?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah, there could be a little show about you

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
called, What's Up with Adam?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
And you could be the question mark

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
at the end of the title sequence.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Is that his segment?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
You're leaning up against the M and Adam,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
and kind of like, I don't know, you tell me.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Adam's spine is so crooked,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
it makes Jeff look straight.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
That's forgetting 50 retweets

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
for a picture of me doing this

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
and saying it's the face of Asperger's.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Leading my brother to call me furiously,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
is that guy Jeff bullying you?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
I can take him.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
I did not say it was the face of Asperger's.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I said it was a Harmontown Asperger's fight

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
or something like that.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
It's not like I haven't re-read it.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Asperger's!

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
With anger and evil!

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I'm evil! That was the twist!

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I'm sorry if I bullied you, I love you.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
I was like, oh, this guy who's cool,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Otto, he's Eric Eidel,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
and I tried to play it off cool

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
as we walked down to the cab

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
where he was taking a cab.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Good sentence construction there.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
I said, oh, I meant, did you have a birthday card

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
for Jeff whose birthday is coming up?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Why do you say birthday like Will Smith?

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
You spell it with an F instead of a TH.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Like, welcome to Earth.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Yeah, welcome to birth.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
You don't have a speech impediment.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
You just say birthday, Rob.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I used to. I worked that one out.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I used to not be able to tell the difference

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
but it was, it was terrible.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
What did you say? Let me think of a word with TH in it.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Oh, now I will mispronounce it.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I can't even say it.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
So just don't get me started on, like,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
theory and the whack.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Now that I'm highly aware of it.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
No, no, no, it's fine. This is we're having a good time.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I feel like, is anybody ever seen the movie,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
The Music Man?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I feel like this is a weird deleted scene.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Definitely.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
You just hang out with the cat.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Now, what's your deal?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Are you going to sing Gary and Diana?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Hell, we're learning so much about you.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Thanks for making the band.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
All right, well, that's just the clarification of the story.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I'm going to go sit over Yonder.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
All right, it's Adam Goldberg, everybody.

20:38.000 --> 20:49.000
An unremarkable name for a very remarkable young lad

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
with a, with a, with a, with a,

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
be set upon spine according to him.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
We should bring up our guest.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
We should bring up our guest pretty soon.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Let's start off by welcoming back

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
our Dungeon Master, Spencer, everybody.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Oh, yeah, let's bring him up.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
For those of you just tuning in,

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
we are well into a campaign of Dungeons and Dragons,

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
and we have the Dungeon Master to the stars, Spencer.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
What's your last name, Spencer?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Crittenden.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Just go with Spencer, it's fine.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
That seems like, that seems like...

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I didn't choose it.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
That sounds like you're like young Chevy Chase's bit,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
like of making up a name.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Crittenden.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
It's just trailing off.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
We have a special treat tonight.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
We have a guest in the house tonight.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Yeah, yeah, we're going to have him come up

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
and play, play, play D&D with us.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Airport security.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Just a, just a, just a quick thing,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
because I've been traveling a lot lately,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
and we're going through the airport.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Please welcome airport security, everybody.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
North Carolina.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Here's the thing, okay, security.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
You go through, you take off your shoes,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
you take off your belt, you put your wallet in the thing,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
you got everything in your pocket,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
you put it all in your bag, your laptop,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
put it in a separate thing, put the shoes through the thing.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
You go through the thing,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
and then the only thing that I don't understand

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
about it is at the very end,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
when the things come out in the conveyor belt,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
you're through the whole thing,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
and then you're grabbing your belt and your shoes,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
and you're like, there's always some dick

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
that's like, like, like, come up,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
people, you gotta, you gotta keep it moving.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Like, like, like, always.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I get so fucking mad, because you know,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
you can't, you can't like, tell them what a dick

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
they're being, because it's, you know,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
they'll just arrest you, you're a terrorist, if you go,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
you're a dick. Like, what, what, what are you,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
why are they surprised they're the,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
was it expedience, your goal now?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
You just fucking, what are you talking about?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
I'm half naked, I got all my shit in the fucking thing.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
You're at, ooh, what's going on?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Why is everything so slow around here?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Because of you!

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Are you crazy?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Maybe take my shoes off.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I want to murder you.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
And I haven't allowed to say it.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Go to court.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
They'll come arrest you.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
A guy tweeted that he was going to blow up an airport

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
and they went to his house and are, like,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
because he was at the airport when he tweeted it,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
but then they like, had to figure out who he was

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
and they went to his house and like,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
There's a hockey referee just got busted for making that

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
like, oh, I got a bomb and they put me,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
he's in jail.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Fuck you, fuck you, man, fuck you.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
The reason why it's illegal to joke

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
that you have a bomb, I guess,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
is so that you can't kind of like,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
figure it, like walk into an airport and go like,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I have a bomb, I have a bomb.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
They just don't want to, you know,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
you can't, okay, fine.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
So you can't, you can't fuck around

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
with that kind of conversation in an airport

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
because it'll throw a monkey wrench into

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
the TSA's works.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Not a government agency,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
private company.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Nothing in the Constitution

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
about any of this going on.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
By the way,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
do we really think that

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Al-Qaeda is going like,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
all right, good job on 9-11.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Let's do another one.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Another 9-11.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
They'll never see that coming.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
How do we do it?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Let's do 9-12.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
They're not retarded.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I'm sorry, retarded people.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
My sister's retarded.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
The Al-Qaeda is retarded,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
and by that I mean that they are capable

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
of anything.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
Nice save.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
But I also don't want

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
to go to Guantanamo Bay

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
for saying that.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
It gets really confusing.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Political correctness merged with the new

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Patriot Act.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
You're in Guantanamo Bay.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Why are you here? I said Al-Qaeda was retarded.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
But no, you don't understand.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Retarded people are special.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
They're courageous.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
They can do anything.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
You're not allowed to say that about a terrorist.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
They're cowards.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
They are jealous of our way of life.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
They accidentally knocked down

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
the two biggest buildings in the world

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
with a box cutter.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
They're completely

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
ineffective. They should be totally ignored.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Please welcome to the stage Steve Agee.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I tried to earlier, man.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I tried to.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I don't like...

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I am a control freak. I like to bring

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
the guests up.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
You hate flying, right?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
You kind of Goldberg-ed me a little.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Steve Agee, it's our friend Steve Agee.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Steve Agee, do you have any thoughts about the airport?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Oh my god, why do they call it flying?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
More like waiting to fly, am I right?

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Wrong song, Jeff.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
We discovered a thing

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
at the yesterday's show

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
at this podcast festival.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Agee does hack stand-up

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
and then Jeff just plays a music cue

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
after each joke.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
And it's pretty fun.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Let's try it out.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
How about this heat?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I was masturbating yesterday

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
and shot a load of sweat.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
It's like

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
laughing.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
The picture is coming

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
out of little doors.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
You don't know until the end.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Dan, do a joke now about airport security.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Oh Jesus, these guys

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
you know

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
they

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
they

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I don't know

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Steve, you're up.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
So they don't serve

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
peanuts anymore.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I was on the flight and they didn't even serve food

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
and I noticed in my seat

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
in front of me they didn't even have barf bags.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I was like, why not the barf bags?

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
They don't serve food anymore.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
We'll be right back.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
There's some heavy dancing going on over there.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I like just

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
gentle leg kicks.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
It's a new thing

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I like doing.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
So Steve, you're going to play Dungeons & Dragons

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
with us?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I'd love to try.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Have you ever played before?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Nor have I until this campaign.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Yeah, well we've become really good at it.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
really honestly it's embarrassing to say

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
but the last show that we did

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
where troops came up and we played D&D

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
again there's been a show since then

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
but we didn't play

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
D&D in the last game

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
or the last show, right?

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
We skipped it

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
and Spencer had

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
a beard

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
opening

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
to speak at.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Congratulations by the way.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
It's a huge honor.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
There was a new beard opening

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
across town

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
and he had to

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
cut the ribbon

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
with his beard

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
scissors.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
It's something

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
he thought he'd be on time

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
because they usually go very fast

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
because as you know

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
the beard scissors are very sharp

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
because they're not used

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
for anything but cutting ribbons.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
They don't cut their beards with them.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Otherwise you wouldn't have a beard.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Is that me?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Aaron's calling me.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
What?

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Aaron's calling and texting

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
wondering if her character is going to be in this game.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Wow.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
She called you from the second row?

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
That's an argument

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
for turning your phone off

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
during a show.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
But then how would we have known

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
that Aaron wanted to be on stage?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Yeah.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
What are we supposed to just guess that?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
You could knock me over

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
the feather right now.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Our heroes

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
had been camping in the Connie Forest.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
As they awoke, they realized

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
their unicorn compatriot had vanished.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Heading deeper into the forest,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
tensions ran high without the soothing

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
relief of Tylenol with codeine.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
In a fit of confusion

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
and self-doubt, Sharpie left his friends

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
and got all reflective and deep

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
while looking into a lake.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Resolving to confront his daddy issues

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
after ending the dark influence

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
of Admiral Darkstar, Sharpie and Quark

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
renewed their adventurers pact

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
and with a new sense of confidence and purpose

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
plunged into the heart of the Forest of Shadows.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I think I had this in my regular life.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
As I get older

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I could just consult with you

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
each day.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
What happened yesterday, Spencer?

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Dan Harmon went to the bank because he needed to get

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
a cashier's receipt for a sex toy.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
A cashier's receipt?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
What?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
What are you talking about, Spencer?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
I don't know.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I just followed you around.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I blazed a doobie in the parking lot.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
A doobie.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
A beard doobie.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I don't know what...

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Shut up, Dan. Just shut up.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Dan Harmon.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Shut up.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
All right, now talk.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Sorry.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Really gold-burgan it up here, man.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
All right, so...

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Do you have a bunch of characters?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Yeah, yeah. Let's get our characters in hand.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Dennis from Rockford, Illinois.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
How's it going? Are you enjoying the show?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Love it. Thank you.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
You said your girlfriend didn't want to come with you, right?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
She's out of work.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Oh, she didn't come with you to LA?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Right.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
This is Jeff.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Hey, Dan. You're doing great up there, man.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Thanks, buddy.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Turn your fucking phone off.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Hello?

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I put it on speaker.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I thought it would get weird.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Like an infinity mirror.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Let's try it.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
This is like the early days of...

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Shit, now Aaron's calling.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Oh, sorry. I have Aaron on the other line.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Oh, shit.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Hello, Aaron?

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
No, this is me.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Wait, let me switch over.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Aaron?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Yeah.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Can you hold on? I have Jeff on the other line.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I'll give you the calls.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Okay.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Steve, give me a call with you.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Hello? Aaron?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Hello?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Hi.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
How are you guys doing?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Are we breaking the podcast right now?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Are we breaking the podcast right now?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
If Alexander Graham Bell had seen this day coming...

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Wait, hang on, hang on.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I got Steve Agee coming in.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Hello?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Hey, Jeff, what are you guys doing over there?

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
What are you guys doing over there?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
We're...

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
doing the stupidest bit of all time.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Oh, yeah.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I can see it.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Are we all on the same call?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Yeah.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Whoa!

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Hey, you guys, I have a bit for you

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
from my Evernote bit file

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
for Harmonar.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Uh...

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Hold on a second.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Did you guys know that

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
in high school,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
uh...

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
famous Austrian physicist

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Erwin Schrodinger,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
uh...

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
his prom date

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
left with a veterinarian?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Yeah.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Yeah.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Adam, Adam, you like that?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Yeah.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I'm just gonna come on stage

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
for my characters by that.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Yeah, that's cool.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
All right, come on up.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
All right.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Erin McGathy.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Wow.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
In Adam Goldbergian fashion,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
just storm the stage whenever you want, everybody.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Just come on up.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
You know, we should just turn this

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
the show around and then we'll be the audience.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I am usually the one

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
that is the most entertained at these shows.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I should be called the audience.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Uh...

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
That was bullshit, right?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
The phone thing? We tried it. It was worth a try.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Did it work? What do you mean?

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Did that pay off? Was that good?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I don't know.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
It was a concept.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
It was certainly worth trying.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
We don't want to go to the moon

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
and not have tried that.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Yeah, we need to know how things work

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
when we get up there.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Are you here on one call? Can someone call you?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
We might have had a tiger by the tail right there.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Um...

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Talk about it more.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I didn't invite you up here at Coxsucker.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Did you call her a Coxsucker?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I did.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Uh...

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
I don't know.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I was going to say thank you and then I grossed myself out.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
One step ahead of you.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Uh...

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Uh...

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Yeah, Schrodinger, get it? Because he's famous for...

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
The cat.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
The box.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
You know that at one point, some girl he liked,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
married a veterinarian or something.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
That's all I'm saying.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
I'm going to use my physics powers

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
to hold a cat's life

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
in the palm of my hand

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
for all of eternity.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Cat 101?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Well, uh...

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Do we start playing Dungeons & Dragons now?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
The Thick Tall Trees.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Ah!

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
The Thick Tall Trees give way to spindly

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
the blambles and the packed dirt

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
and loam of the forest fade into muddy swamps

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
as you follow the path.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Deep within dark stars set

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
desecration you'd embark.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
That was stupid.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
The sounds of wildlife

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
die off and all is quiet save

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
an occasional clacking rustle

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
and the ripples of water lapping at rotting tree trunks.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Sharpie!

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Yes, Quirk? How are you?

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
It's been a couple weeks.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Yeah.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
It seems like weeks

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
since I knew what the hell was going on.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Yeah. Well, when you're walking

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
is this described?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
You know, time can fly.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Right.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Refresh my memory

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
on Admiral Darkstar.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
He's an...

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Admiral Darkstar is off.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
My voice trails off as

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Spencer's V.O. comes in.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
The corrupting influence of Admiral Darkstar

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
and his dark cult

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
have wrought terrible destruction on the forest

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
transforming it into the forest of shadows.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
You hope to assault his ziggurat

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
in hopes of dethroning him

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
and ending his dark...

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Sharpie, I know what a ziggurat is

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
but just for everybody else

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
that doesn't know what a ziggurat is.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Just refresh.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
A ziggurat is a pyramidal temple

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
used for the worship of ancient cultures.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Thanks, Sharpie.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
No problem.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I examine my surroundings, Spencer.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
You see a wooden sign

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
hanging from a blackened husk of a tree

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
standing in the middle of the muddy path.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
It is adorned with a black skull

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
and a black star.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Under the sign, you see a pile of corpses.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
But wait.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
We see the sign first before the corpses?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
You love signs.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Not too bothered about that.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I saw the sign

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
and it opened up my mind.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
I saw the sign.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Full circle.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Adam Goldberg is freaking out right now.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
There's so many dots are being connected.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
A stirring comes within the corpses.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Don't bully him then.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
It may be a survivor.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
He extricates himself

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
from the pile of corpses and stands.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
He's wearing plate armor

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
and holding the golden seal

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
of Pelor.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Speak, survivor!

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
That's you.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Hey, I'm Marcus Goldberg.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I'm sorry.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I'm Goldbright.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Goldbright.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I'm a Jew.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
A magical Jew.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
A human Jew.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Please help me.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I mean, don't help me with being Jewish.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I'm laying in a pile of corpses.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Help me.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Do you want us to sit shim?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
That's a...

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
That's a Jewish reference.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Oh, it's Maris.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Not Marcus.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Maris Goldbright.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Maris Goldbright.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Surely, new friend.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I lift him with my great strength

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
and I hug him

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
as I'm lifting him.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
You hug him successfully.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
How do you feel about that?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
What's with your overzealous friend

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
here, fellas?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
You're asking me?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
You're asking me?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Have you

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
seen Admiral Darkstar

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
or any of his minions?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Yeah, they're the ones

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
that caused all this bullshit

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
that I'm laying here in.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
How is it, my friend,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Maris Goldbright?

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Yep.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Yes.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
How is it that you are the lone survivor

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
of this travesty?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I'm a coward

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
and I hid beneath the bodies

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
for safety.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I took my best friend

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
and laid his corpse over me.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Who's lapping now,

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
the sole survivor?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Well, it was cowardly of you to do that,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
but so brave to tell us.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Surely, you would like to join us

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
in avenging the death of your friends.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
I'll

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
stand behind you, of course.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Yes, I would like to help avenge.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
We're going to get so many letters

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
from synagogues.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Look at that.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Mr. Harmon,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
could your cowardly

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Jewish character

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
have participated

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
a little?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
No, maybe he redeems himself.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Yeah, well, we don't know. I'm just keeping my eye on that

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
as a potential

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
special interest group disaster.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
You notice there's been no black people

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
in this adventure, so...

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
By the way, that's your own perception.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I never mentioned race. If you read into that,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
that's not me.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
That's the weirdest applause ever.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Dungeon Snap.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Well, I don't know.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
My character is male

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
and I've always thought of him as

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
black.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
All right, well, that's Tia.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
It sounds like a bit. It's not a bit.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
This stuff wouldn't come to light if I didn't bring it up,

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
but then I get crucified. That's the story of my life.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
By the way, I thought this said level 2 hymen.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
But it doesn't.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
It's so much less breakable than a level 1.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I have a level 2 hymen.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
True story, I still have my hymen.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Did you know that?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
This armor class is

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
impenetrable.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
My vorpal dick can't even get through it.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Stick is a button.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
That's not...

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
I was yassanding in a way that wasn't

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
an insult. I'm kidding.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
It's like a horse was a

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
log and then that log

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
was blessed by God. That's dance dick.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I'm sorry.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
There's even the paths around us.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Past the blacken tree,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
you see a massive construction

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
of sticks, mud and bones

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
with a gated graveyard to the south.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
This is Darkstar Ziggurat.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Past the wrought iron fence

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
of the graveyard, you see figures cloaked

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
in black digging with shovels and hauling

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
corpses. You see an ornate wooden door

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
entering into the Ziggurat.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Past the north wall, you see

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
the glow of perhaps a fire.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Ziggurat?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
We're out of their vision

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
cones. You're like peering behind

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
this tree. You're pretty far off.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
They haven't noticed you. They're inside

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
a fenced area. I know this isn't in my nature

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
but I'm recommending we hide.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
You always recommend it.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Alright, thank you. I second that.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I know where there's a pile of corpses

41:42.000 --> 41:48.000
we can hide under you guys.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Maris. Maris Goldbrite.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Dress yourself in corpses

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
and move slowly closer

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
so they won't know what it is.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Go hide yourself in a pile

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
of corpses and examine the gate.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Alright.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
What?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
It's like, you know,

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
when you dress like a bush

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
and you slowly move closer to something.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Right, but you want them to be

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
It's a cemetery.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
It's a pile of bodies.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
They won't think anything about it.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
But the dead bodies will be moving.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Only when they're not looking.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Does he have super strength?

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Why don't you do this?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Okay.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I clad myself

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
with all of the corpses

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
and slowly

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
in a red light green light fashion

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
move a camouflage

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
towards the gate of the cemetery.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I don't understand.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I want to get a closer look.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
You hide yourself

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
into the pile of bodies

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
and manage to shift it

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
ever slowly towards the gate of the cemetery.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Sweet.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Approaching the front gate.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
You notice that no one has taken notice of you.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
See? Guys, get over here.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Shhh.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I grab some bodies

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
and I put them on my body.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
And I put them on my body.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
And I do the same.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Except I do it

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
cooler.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
You manage to put

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
one body

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
on top of your own

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
and rush over towards...

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I say this is one of those situations

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
like in a movie where, you know,

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
like if we can take one of these guys out,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
you know, we take their robes.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Am I close enough to see these dark figures

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
in robes? You can see them.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
They seem unusually pale

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
and thin.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Can you...

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Dan, don't you have to detect evil

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
or detect magic or some kind of thing like that?

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Yeah, but we know they're evil and magic.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
That's metagaming.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
You don't know that.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
They could just be in a goth band.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
An alternative lifestyle.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I'm trying to look for like a charm spell or something.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I apropos of nothing give

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
quirk a

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
present.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
What present?

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
It's a bow

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
that is shaped like a space.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I took tea and I

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
stained fabric

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
with a shadow.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Quirk falls asleep.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
You don't have any fabric.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
You can get some at the store later.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
What are these guys doing?

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
They're digging or...

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
They're digging and hauling corpses into the ziggurat.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Are there any of them that are away from

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
the larger amount of them that are vulnerable

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
to some kind of like a little ambush,

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
a little subterfuge,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
a little hoken poke?

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
You see one about five foot

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
off of the hole in the fence.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
You might be able to dash over there

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
and take them out before anyone notices.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I'm going to try to cast sleep...

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Is the sleep spell...

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Is that a ranged thing?

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Can I cast sleep on somebody?

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Yeah, you can get up close to them and cast them.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
I'm going to try to put this guy to sleep.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
All right.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
All right, he successfully...

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
No, he does not successfully

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
save, making him fall asleep.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
He falls asleep.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
That was a real roller coaster ride.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
You do not have

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
no aids.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I examine his bodies

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
or anything left in his clothing

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
in his body. I examine that.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
You see a rotting belt. It doesn't seem

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
to wash.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Quirk throws up till he dies.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Oh, I'm just kidding.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
All right, well, I got the robe on.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
I'm in disguise.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Go infiltrate, Sharpie.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I'm going to infiltrate.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
I watch the behavior of my

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
cohorts...

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
cohorts and quotes.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
You notice a market difference between

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
types of cohorts.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
One moves stiffly, slowly,

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
unnoticing of others.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
The other seems pretty normal,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
hauling corpses into the ziggurat

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
and looking about like regular people.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
We got some walking dead shit going on here.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Yeah?

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I say to myself...

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Not knowing what walking dead shit is.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I emulate the movements of the stiff

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
stiff ones.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
You successfully emulate the movements.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
You walk among the walkers.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Looking good, Sharpie!

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Sharpie, get up to that ziggurat

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
and word, you approach

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
the door of the ziggurat. It is open.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
All right.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
I open the

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
door to the ziggurat. It's already open.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
You

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
peer inside the ziggurat and see a large

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
stone entry hall.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Several coat racks stand in the hall.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
I know that's a trick.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I'm supposed to hang up the robe, but that's my disguise.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Holding several black cloaks.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I'm going to grab a couple of them.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Yeah, bring them to us.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Let's say three.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
There is a cultist in the room watching.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Do you try to do this sneakily or do you just

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
like...

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
looking directly at him?

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
He's really eyeballing me.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
He hasn't taken much notice of you,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
but perhaps if you took a few cloaks, he might.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
You think to yourself...

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Sharpie, bring Morris,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Goldbright in and tell him that he's

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
here to pick up a dry cleaning.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Tell him it's...

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
I'm going to try to cast

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Charm Person on him.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Okay. You cast Charm Person.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
He regards you with high interest

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
as if you are a trusted friend or ally.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
How are you doing?

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
How can I help you?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Need cloaks.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Well, there's tons of cloaks.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
You should grab several.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Just three is fine.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Are you thirsty?

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Huh?

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Would you like a drink?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Yeah, I guess.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
He procures three cloaks

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
and a drink and puts them in a bag

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
for you.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Thank you.

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
Uh, how's Tracy?

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Like, I'm so glad you remembered

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
this is why we're close friends.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
She's doing well, as am I.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Uh, well, uh,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
same shit, different day.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
You know that Admiral Darkstar

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
always creating undead

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
and taking power naps.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
I'll catch you on the flip-flop.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Have a good time.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I, I stiffly exit the cigarette

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
and go back to my real compatriots,

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
not in quotes.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
You managed to do this with wall escaping notice.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Who's impressed now?

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
That was pretty good.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Thank you.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Nice to see you be brave.

49:02.000 --> 49:12.000
What took you so long?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
It's cold out here, you know.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Marisk, you stop eating my bagel.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I'm an indoor person.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I teach these guys how to walk

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
stiffly in a hilarious

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Shaun of the Dead

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
montage.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
You think you managed to communicate

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
the proper manner

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
and walk.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
And that's how you do it.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Where should we go now?

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Into the cigarette.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
We enter the cigarette,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
donning the cloaks that Sharpie has brought

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
and adopting the mannerisms of the dead.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
You managed to waltz right in

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
past all the undead and guards.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
You're going to see a guy

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
in the injury wound.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
It's cool, he's with me.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
I examine the cigarette.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
It's the outside

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
inside.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
You were in the entry hall.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Blue candles lined the walls and sconces.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
There are three doors,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
one on each wall of the squared room.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Oh, and the door you came in.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Four doors, sorry guys.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Triangles are square.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Wait, what?

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
There's three other doors.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
There are three other doors against the wall.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
All right.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I approach the door on the far left.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
You approach the door

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
on the far left.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
I watch your approach

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
the door on the far left.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
You witness the approaching

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
of the door.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I examine his witness.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
The examination of the witness

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
for his success.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
I write down a journal entry about what it was like

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
to approach the door.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
The journal entry is enthralling.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I tremble.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
The tremble is

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
pitiable.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
try to open

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
the door.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Do you want to hear, do you want to listen

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
at the door perhaps?

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
No, no, no.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Go, go.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
You open the door holding,

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
wearing the cloak.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I listen.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
You listen to the sounds of people murmuring

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
and sitting.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
You hear their seats.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
I hear people sitting.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
You're half-elf ears.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
You hear the sitting of the people

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
in the room.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Just so I know for reference,

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Spencer, what does sitting sound like?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
If you could just do it with your mouth.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
All right.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I was holding the mic near my butt

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
for the pod last week.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Everyone, people are talking in there

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
quietly and sitting.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Oh, I vote for that.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
I'm so

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
tired.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
I'd love a seat.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
You know what?

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Morris, I still feel like

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
something's going to really pay off.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
I think you're going to save the day somehow.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
He better, I'm telling you.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
We're going to get sued.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
That's another stereotype, isn't it?

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
I'm just

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
making it worse.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
We're going to get

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
mileage off cocktailed.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I examine the door in the middle.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
You hear the sounds of dull scraping

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
as if something is being

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
drugged across a stone floor.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
I don't like that.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
What are we hoping to hear? Happy birthday?

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
We're looking for the door.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
I listened to the third door on the right.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
You hear silence.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Well, that's a start.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I open the third door.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
The silent one.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
The walls are draped in black wall hangings

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
and rows of pews made of red

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
stained wood sit empty facing

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
an obsidian podium.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Doubtless, the cultists listen to many a mad raving

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
or dazzling lecture in this room.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
A large golden statue

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
stands well behind the podium.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
It's a human in plate mail

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
wielding a black sword, but the statue

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
is missing its head. You don't know

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
what statement the sculptor was trying to make.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Morris, you've been an art critic, an art fan.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Did this speak to you at all, the statue?

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Well, I'm a human.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I recognize it's one of my kind.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I don't like the fact that he's missing a head.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Thank you.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I walk to the statue

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
and examine it.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
It is a large nine foot tall statue.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
You can't see on top of its head

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
because it doesn't have one.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Hey, Quark, crawl up there

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
and see if there's a button where its head should be.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
I crawl on Sharpie's shoulders

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
to examine the top of the statue.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
You can see a setting

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
as if something is supposed to fit in there.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Like a dick, right?

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Gentleman.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
There's a door on the other side of the room.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I examine the door.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
It is made of wood.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
You do not approve of its design.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Fellas.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Noop.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Yeah, it's like that shitty belt I saw earlier.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
I examined the other thing.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Tackiest cigarette ever.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
What does the fitting look like in the head?

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
It looks circular with a square peg.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Circular with a square peg.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Wait, is it a button

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
or it has a square peg in it?

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
It's a circular divot

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
with a square peg protruding.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Guys, all we got to do is find a head

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
with a peg sticking out of the neck.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Thanks, Morris.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
We have to fix the head

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
like a Lego piece and get it out.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Yeah, sure.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
We got to go find that head.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
It's got to be on the other side of this wooden door

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
that you hate.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Guys, I hate this door, but can we go through it?

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Let's listen at it.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Don't forget what we learned about doors.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
We listened at the door behind the statue.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Standing at the door,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
you can't help but shake the perceptible

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
smell of foul rotting decay.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
You hear the same scraping sounds

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
as if something is being dragged

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
across a stone floor.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Spencer, this is getting really scary.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Better join to that middle room with the scraping

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
and the dragging.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Spencer, do I have any arrows?

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
You should have 12 arrows left.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Okay.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I want to open the door because I have these arrows.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
All right, guys, I'm going to open the door.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
You ready your arrows?

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Okay, I ready my arrows.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
And then when I open the door, I'll just...

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
I'll ready my spear.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
By the way, I have a spear.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
There you go.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
And then you get ready to charge in there

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
in a berserker rage.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I'm going to open the door and in one movement

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I'll be kind of behind it just because

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
someone's got to open the door.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
A wave of noxious stench

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
blasts through the door frame.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
See an assortment of bones.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
It looks like a snake but is made out of

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
the fused ribcages of what appears to be

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
at least 40 men.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
The head of the snake is not a snake head

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
but instead a golden skull

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
of a human.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Its eyes are set with emeralds

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
and around its neck hangs a golden chain

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
with an emerald setting.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Is the snake alive? Is it moving?

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
It is moving about the floor creating a loud

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
grating sound.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I attacked a snake with my sword.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Drawing your sword and lunging at the snake.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
You strike at its back.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Everything's ruined.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
You strike the back

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
of the snake.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Your sword rings against its bone

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
thing.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
You strike a crack.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
It takes

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
11 damage.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Is that good? That's pretty good.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Alright.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I shoot

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
an arrow

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
at the...

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
It's like a golf tournament.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Jeff Davis has swung at the

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
human centipede monster.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
11 points.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Like a 7 sword?

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Or is that an 8?

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
What sword do you think

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
he used on that one?

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
get out from behind the door so I can get into this

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
melee with some of my trademark spells

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
like Ray of Frost, Magic Missile, and the like.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
You head into the door

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
as Mulraine is knocking an arrow.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
She loses it. It flies past your head

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
directly at the snake.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Sorry.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
You hit the snake critically.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
It is a critical hit.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Right.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
But a ratings disaster.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
That was like Dane Cook's arrow.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Your arrow lodges

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
in the neck of the snake.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
It hits for 14 damage.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
The snake falls apart

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
into bone pieces.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
The golden skull

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
bounces to your feet.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
I looked at Quark for a nod of respect.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
You know what, kid?

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
You're alright.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Alright. This is great.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Hey Morris, you like gold?

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Go grab that head.

58:34.000 --> 58:40.000
I inspect the head with my loop.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
That's terrible.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
It's easily worth at least 50 platinum pieces.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Let's take it, guys.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Into the other room

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
and put it on top of the statue.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
I take the head, jump up on

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Sharpie's shoulders, and place the head

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
on top of the statue.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
You do that, but in the other room,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
and do that successfully,

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
the head fits perfectly

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
onto the shoulders of the statue.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
You hear a far-off grinding,

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
and the statue slowly turns,

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
revealing a staircase

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
upwards.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Good time to quit.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
You want to set up camp

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
at the base of the staircase?

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
And just tell some stories?

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
We'll just pause it, and then we'll

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
pick things up from there next week.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
We'll hit a pause. Spencer, everybody.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Yeah, there you go.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Alright. Erin McGathy is Mulraine Saddam.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Hey Zach, usually that clock is lit up.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
What are we looking at?

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
What have we done here tonight? What's the damage?

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
We've entered

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
that portion of our show

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
where we're forever in search

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
of an ending.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
What have we got here?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I didn't tell, I said this yesterday,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
but there's only one guy that was here yesterday.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So I was in Asheville, North Carolina

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
for this very awkward wedding.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And I don't want to say awkward wedding,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
in case the brighter groom

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
are listening. Aaron's little brother, Michael,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
is a delightful little guy,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
and his lovely wife, Bonnie.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Congratulations to them.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I think because of

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
lack of resources and

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
busy schedules and things,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
they put their wedding in the hands

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
of

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
what I really have no problem

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
characterizing as an evil southern family.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
This is just

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
family that's like

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
friends of the

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
bride, but they're like not related

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
biologically to anybody, but there were more

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
of them at the wedding

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
than anybody else.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
It was like Dallas, they owned everything

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
and they hated everyone

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and they were just there to watch the wedding

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
disappoint them.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
It was a really, really weird experience.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
They also hosted the

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
wedding rehearsal dinner at their house,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
but they all ate inside

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
and it was very cold out

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
and they built a fire for us, like cavemen.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
And we were just

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
welcome, you're welcome to be out there

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
and there's coolers full of beer

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
and we were just these weird

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
visit Goths camping outside their house

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
and they invited us in for one

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
game.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
They had researched, they probably

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Googled weddings or something and

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
they invited us in

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
for into the indoors

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
for a

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
wedding game where

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
the bride and groom had to sit back to back

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
and remove one shoe each

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
and they said they're each holding

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
a shoe and sitting back to back and then

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
all the guests had written questions on

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
an index card, like

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
who's going to clean the toilets

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
and then they each hold

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
up one of the shoes, either theirs

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
or the spouse's.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Dumb.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Just dumb. You know, these wedding games are dumb.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
There's a fucked up

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
wedding games. If you've ever gone to a reception

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
or I went to a wedding in Milwaukee where

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
they played this wedding game where the

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
groom was blindfolded

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
and the bridesmaids

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
were all lined up

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
with the bride sitting

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
in chairs and he had

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
to try to

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
guess

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
which woman was his

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
by feeling their legs.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Yeah.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
That's a recipe

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
for success.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It's felt very Japanese.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I was like, are we

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
in Tokyo?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Are we going to start drinking pee in a minute?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Imagine a wedding.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I kept thinking, I was at the

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
wedding reception because it was very

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
there was no music. It was just kind of

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
fluorescent lit and

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
it was very fast and furious

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
there was a guy that introduced

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
the bride and groom at the reception

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
and he went like, all right

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
here they are

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
the bride and groom.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
It was like

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
we were all hostages.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
It was so weird. I kept expecting

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I was thinking like

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
this would be a great cold open of a pilot

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
if you were at

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
a wedding reception or there's something just

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
off about it and you don't know what it is

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
and then someone would run in and go

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
the perimeter's breached.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
There's walkers and the tripwires

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
you know and everyone

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
would run over to a table full of guns

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
and like suit up.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It turns out it's 2038

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
we're in a free fire zone and

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
we were witnessing a brief

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
futile attempt to emulate

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
a golden age society

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
as everyone's actually just

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
race marines.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Do you want to get married?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Yeah.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
What would your ideal wedding be like?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Can you envision that?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
It'll have probably a Raiders of the

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Lost Ark theme I think.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
That would be awesome.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Where the audience, the guests

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
will be invited to help me find

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
a new way of life together

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
that has been

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
that the Nazis

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
are also trying to get to

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
and if they play their cards right

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
by the end of it it's like thank you

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
my wife and I

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
thank you so much for helping.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Thank God the Nazis didn't get married instead.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Which character

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
would be the minister

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
or the efficient?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Belak.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Because he's not so different

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
you and I.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
That's how he would start it.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
We're not so different you and I Dan Harmon.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
We're not men of God

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
but

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
we believe in

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
value, our artifacts.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I don't know about that.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I would have an arc to my wedding.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I would want to be a protagonist.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I would learn how to get married.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I would start by going

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
this is bullshit.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
All I need is my blaster on my side.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I don't believe in no force.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
So you're just going to be all Harrison Ford movies?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Yeah.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And then the third act I just kick someone

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
out of the plane.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I believe in the force now.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Belak.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Yeah, it would be a Harrison Ford wedding.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Would you get a bullet in the brain

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
and forget how to love?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Yeah, that would be the second act.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Ritz.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
One of our men would come and kill your wife

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
as soon as you were married.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I didn't kill my wife.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
In all seriousness,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I would like to have

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
something to the ceremony where

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
they say speak now or forever.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Yeah, they do that business.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It's become a joke now.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
But it would be nice to have somebody come in

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
that was dressed

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
as a purple monster or something

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
and go like, I don't want this wedding

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
to happen.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I'm lack of love.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Lack of love, get out of here.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I'm going to marry this woman.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Not if I have anything to do with it.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Then you wrestle in the aisle.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
That would be cool.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
So you're saying you're never going to get married?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I just need to find a woman

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
who's willing to have her brother

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
dress like a purple monster.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Do you envision yourself being married

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
at any point?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Yeah.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Are you a romantic fellow?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Nope.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
You don't think of yourself as romantic?

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I just want it for the tax benefits.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
We don't picture ourselves dying either,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
we know what's going to happen.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
It just happens.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Everybody gets married.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Yeah, eventually.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Babies don't get married.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Sometimes they die.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Sometimes a baby dies

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
without ever knowing what love is.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Oh, I'm lying?

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It's truth.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Cemetery's are full of unmarried, dead babies.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
It's true.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I'm sorry.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Once again, I'm...

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I don't approve of this.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
It's horrible.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
They should have thought about that.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I brought this up for some reason.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I can't remember what it was.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
We went on a ghost tour.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
What the fuck?

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Why did they bring this up?

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
We were in North Carolina.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
We were there for the wedding.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I'm so sorry.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
You went on a ghost tour.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
We went on a ghost tour.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
We went on a walking ghost tour of Asheville.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Was it a ghost adventure?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
It was a ghost adventure.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It was like a ghost hunter thing.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Were there two guys with tribal tattoos next to you?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
No, it was just this hippie lady

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
with more socks and sandals and a windbreaker.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Was it outside?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Because they don't have any money,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
so you're just walking around just pointing at buildings.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Everybody goes, get out of here.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
She's like, I don't know what his problem is.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
You keep pointing at his church

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
and telling people that someone got murdered there.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Like, beat it.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Get a job, you hippie.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
She should say that those guys are ghosts.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
This house is haunted by a guy that hates you on his property.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
She did try to characterize that

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
and other things as paranormal.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
We walked past a place and she's like,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
every business that opens here

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
goes away within two weeks.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I'm like, yeah, there's no parking.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
It's a terrible location.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
It's not a ghost story.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Ghost hunters traipsing through your property.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
It's like the ghost of our economy

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
is haunting.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I'm like, oh, Rada, this is still trickling down

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
from the Reagan days.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
She gave Aaron

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
an actual meter

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
and said,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
these detect ghosts.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Also,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I don't know,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I don't know,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I don't know,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I don't know.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Also electricity

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
and water

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
and temperature variation.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
So, you know, use your own discretion.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
It really is just like a random

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
it is next to a building.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I got a ghost building

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
power line fire hydrant or sidewalk here.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
So that was her tool.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
But she looked the most like a ghost buster

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
on that thing because at least it was beeping

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
and lighting up.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I got a thermometer.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
One of those laser thermometers.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
She gave it to me.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Temperature variations can't,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
when there's ghosts, it can be very cold

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
and all this stuff.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
So a thermometer can actually be a valuable thing.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I'm down with that.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I'd never had one of these laser thermometers

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
and I pointed it across the street and was like,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
hey, how do these things work anyway?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I don't mean how do they detect ghosts.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
How do they read temperature

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
from across the street?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
That's really wild. She's like, you know what?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
I don't really know.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I thought that was hilariously funny.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
You're giving me a thermometer

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
and saying you can use it to detect ghosts.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Hey, how does it work as a thermometer? I don't know.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I don't know.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
There's a ghost in the machine.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Adam Goldberg clapped for that.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:12.000
So you are fucked, my friend.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Then the other girl,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
what is the girl that was the only person

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
that was actually into the whole thing?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
What did she get? What was her tool?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Oh, she had another ghost meter.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
The girls got ghost meters.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
It was two couples.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Two couples.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I got a thermometer

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
and then the remaining guy,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
this poor fucker,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
he got dowsing rods.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
He got two sticks

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
that moved together

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
if there's a ghost or water

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
or for electricity around.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Or if they got too heavy

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
for him to hold anymore.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
He was like using them.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I'm going to guess that because you didn't open

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
this show with this story,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I'm going to guess you didn't see any ghosts.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
We did not.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
She encouraged us to take a lot of pictures

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
and then

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
you take pictures of high ghost areas

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
and then you look at them

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
and then you see a blob of them

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
and you go, oh, it was a ghost.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Orbs.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Yeah, I used to be a ghost owner.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
No big deal.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Obviously, the tour

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
was designed at an age before Google

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
because she would walk past a building and go,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
yeah, 13 people jumped off of that building

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
during the depression and you just pull up your phone

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
and go, no.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
No one ever jumped off that building.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I'm a ridiculous person.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Are you guys familiar with the show Ghost Adventures

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
and Zac Baggins at Toast?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Anyone? My applause?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I tweeted Zac Baggins before I went on this

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Ghost Adventure for advice and he said,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
don't fart.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
No.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
It's like

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
it's like spraying off

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
in the jungle.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I guess Ghost Hate Farts is what he was saying.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Is that why he doesn't see any ghosts

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
on his show?

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Like going to Arby's

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
before a

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Ghost Adventure?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
That show is so fucking ridiculous.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I love it.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Can we get Baggins on the show?

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
No, he'd never do that.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
He's a ghost hunter, of course.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
We can get him on the show.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Tell him there's a ghost at Nerdmelt.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Tell him

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
comedy dies here every night.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
They say you can still hear

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Dana Gould's

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
set

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
howling on the old number nine.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Anyways,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
honestly, I really don't

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
remember why I brought up North Carolina.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
It was an awkward

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
wedding reception. The Jackson family,

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
if you're listening, you can go fuck yourselves.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Just bad people.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Don't ever...

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
The next person that has a wedding rehearsal dinner,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
they're going to be so confused

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
by how many questions I have before I show up.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I'm going to be like, are you sure it's okay if I come?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Am I welcome?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Because I've never felt so unwelcome

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
in a wedding rehearsal in my life.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Oh, the stupid wedding game

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
where they're holding up the shoes.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Everyone has to write down a thing on an index card

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
and ask a question.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I wrote three drafts of my question.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I thought very hard about it.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Who's going to be the first to fart in bed?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Who's going to clean the toilets?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Who's going to

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
file the taxes?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I wrote, it is the year 2038.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Nuclear Armageddon has occurred.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
There are bands of mutant raiders

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
encroaching on your territory

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
to take your last can of beans.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Which of the two of you is most likely to be the first

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
to use lethal force

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
to protect your resources?

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I think they saw the question

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
and they didn't ask it.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
What's this, a novel?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
They didn't ask it.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I didn't want them to.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
They would have butchered it.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Aaron went out and grabbed the question

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
and shared it with her brother.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Now there's a question.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I've been answering about farts all night

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
holding up a shoe.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
That's a good question.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Thank you, Michael, McGathey.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I agree.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I should be a writer.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Everybody who dresses

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Jareth for Halloween from Labyrinth.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Do you know about this?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Dan and Aaron and I

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
were all dressing as Jareth from Labyrinth.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
David Bowie's character.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
We encourage everybody to come.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
What's our show on your Halloween 29th?

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
We have two shows in the proximity of Halloween.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
We have a show on the 22nd of October.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
And then we have a show on the 29th.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
So we say the 29th

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
is going to be our Halloween Harmontown.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
We encourage you to come as Jareth David Bowie's

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
character from Labyrinth.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
All the Jareths, we're all going to go take over

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
some bar. We're all going to go somewhere.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
We'll figure it out.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I want 900 Jareths to walk into a bar.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
We're going to sing Dance Muppet Dance.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
What's the dance magic dance?

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Dance magic dance.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
It's a Halloween Jareth.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
It's a Halloween Jareth.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I want to

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
dress like

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Jareth for Halloween.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
It's a pretty good Bowie.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
It's not bad. It's not bad at all.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Can you do it early Bowie?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
It's better than Sean Connery.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Most things down here

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
don't react well to bullets.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Sean Connery Bowie.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I Netflix

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
the great just because of

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
your impression of Liam Neeson.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
They don't care about Netflix.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
They're not herbivores.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
They don't stream

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
direct-to-video.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
They don't see proceeds from video on demand.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
It's only available for a limited window

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
that the writers kill the greed of two.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
They don't get residuals.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
They just want to eat you.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Let's figure out how to end this thing.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Quick improv scene.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I'm coming to your

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
store. Steve Agee has a

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
what kind of store?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I heard pickles.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Pickle store.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Dan, just so you know,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I have my finger on the play button

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
for Xanadu.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
It's ready to go.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I can tell the difference between a pity laugh

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
or I want to go home so I'm going to

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
pretend that was funny enough to close the show.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I won't do it. The more you do that,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
the more I'll punish you.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
You'll be here all night.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
We will close the show

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
on a genuine, sincere,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
joyous eruption and nothing more.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Nothing less, sorry.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Steve Agee has a pickle store

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
and I am a

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I'm an Amish farmer.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:32.000
He farms Amish people.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Welcome to Pickles.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I noticed you spelled it

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
P-I-K-K-Y-L-Z

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
exclamation point, exclamation point.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
My father started the business

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
and he was a halfway.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Oh, so it's not charming.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
He's just dumb.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
It's just stupid.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Well, I guess I'll take

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
two standard dills,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
a

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
a sweet

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
basket

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
and can I get a jar of relish?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Just then, the owner of Pickles,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
the old man who created the store,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Adam Goldberg,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
enters the Pickles store.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Why have we got a customer?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Oh, fuck.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Hey, Dad.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Hey, relish man,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
here for your relish?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Dad, he wants a

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
relish basket.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I'll just want, upsell him, upsell him.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
We only get like five customers a week.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I can, I can hear you.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Can he hear me?

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Yeah, he could see you too, Dad.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
There are a lot of,

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
did he make fun of the sign?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
He wasn't impressed with the sign, Dad.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Did you tell him why this?

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Did you call me a something?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Half-wit, yeah.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
I am a three-quarter-wit.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
He's a three-quarter-wit, I'm sorry.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I am in the room

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
and I won't be upsold.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
I heard you say,

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
upsell him.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I came here for Pickles.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I feel like I have a load.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
We got two dills, he said.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Yeah, I'm already ordering a shitload of Pickles.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
That is a shitload.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
That is...

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Have you joined the membership club?

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
We send a little...

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I don't want to get any junk mail.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
It's mostly recipes

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
and it's mostly the same recipes.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
How to turn a cucumber in Pickles.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Things take a decidedly romantic turn somehow.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
There's a membership has its benefits.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
No.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Oh, alright, alright.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Adam Goldberg closes

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
his second episode of Harventshaw.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Alright.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Adam Goldberg.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
and then...

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Steve A.G., everybody.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.560
And then, and then, and then, and then.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.500
And then, and then, and then, and then.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.460
And then, and then, and then, and then, and then.

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.060
Also, I wanna thank Casey Levine,

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.460

Mo Fethel, babon, side director.

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.060
Jeff Davis!

Our artist, Dan Cheruzzi.

Our website designer.

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:17.880
One more time for Steve A.D., everybody.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:21.080
I've been Jeff Davis.

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:24.720

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.720
God bless you. Thank you very much for coming. We'll see you next week.
