{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:10.000\nYeah, latest show.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:20.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:24.000\nAs the groovy, funky, Swedish strains of ace of bass\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:28.000\ngently wash over your cerebral cortexes,\n\n00:28.000 --> 00:39.000\nplease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:46.000\nI think he's seamless, seamless opening tonight.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:49.000\nFor those of you listening in podcast land,\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:52.000\nthere's a 15 minute ordeal trying to get that ace of bass\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:57.000\nsong queued up, had to go to the mayor's iPod.\n\n00:57.000 --> 00:59.000\nI think we do that from now on.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:01.000\nWe're using your iPod for ace of bass,\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:04.000\nbut I say from now on, if people in the crowd have a good song,\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:05.000\nwe kick it off with that one.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:07.000\nUntil we get sued.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:10.000\nSomeone will come in with a Chevy Chase voicemail on their phone\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:12.000\nand say, open with us.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:14.000\nYou got my phone back?\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:16.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:18.000\nSo welcome.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.000\nI would like to thank Jeff Davis for controlling tonight,\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:26.000\nas he always does.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:27.000\nI have some notes.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:28.000\nI want to apologize.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:30.000\nFor those of you, I assume that if you're coming here\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:32.000\nand you're laying $10 on the barrel head,\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:35.000\nthen that means that you're probably a Harmontown podcast\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:36.000\nsubscriber.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:38.000\nAnd that means that you're probably very upset.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:40.000\nThe last couple of weeks, there has been no new\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:42.000\nHarmontown podcast.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:43.000\nWe're two weeks behind.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:45.000\nI was in North Carolina with Erin.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:51.000\nHer little brother was getting married in what unfolded\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:57.000\ninto very awkward turn of events, which I may discuss\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:58.000\nmomentarily.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nI'm just looking at my phone here.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:02.000\nI have my Evernote app loaded up.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.000\nThings tagged Harmontown.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:07.000\nSome of them are mild complaints that I have.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:10.000\nSome little observations.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:12.000\nPerhaps a pied-de-terre.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:19.000\nNo, that's not an expression that means an apartment.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:22.000\nSometimes you just throw a three-word French phrase\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:25.000\ninto things to just give a little joie de vivre\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:28.000\nto a little je ne sais quoi.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:30.000\nHere's a complaint.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:33.000\nWe had some good luck with me complaining about things.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nI didn't think that complaining was charismatic,\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:37.000\nbut we had a good time.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:39.000\nWe were complaining about things that I have no right\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:40.000\nto complain about.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:44.000\nSome would call that a segment of our show.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:48.000\nMy mustache is too absorbent.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nI have to trim it.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:54.000\nI was out of town for 12 days, and I had no trimmer with me.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:59.000\nIt really soaks up quite a bit of vodka, milkshakes,\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:03.000\nwhatever happened to be going into my mouth.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:06.000\nYou don't feel it, because I don't have any nerve endings\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:07.000\nin my mustache.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:11.000\nI wish cats do.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:17.000\nI don't use my mustache to detect the width of openings\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nI want to get through.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nIs the bummer for you that you're being robbed of vodka\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nand milkshakes?\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:24.000\nThat's where that went.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:25.000\nThat's why I'm still sober.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:27.000\nIt's all in my damn mustache.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:32.000\nNo, the bummer is...\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:34.000\nI have no feeling up there.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:37.000\nIf I'm drinking vodka for a while, for instance,\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:41.000\njust as a crazy hypothetical,\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nI can't feel it, so it just feels normal.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:49.000\nBut then, if I go to kiss Erin on the head or something,\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:51.000\nit's like a sponge.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:55.000\nAll of a sudden, there's just liquid everywhere all over her head.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nShe doesn't complain about it.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:01.000\nI guess it's nice, because then she smells like vodka.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:04.000\nI don't know, but I guess there's nothing wrong with it.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:06.000\nMaybe I'll cross that off my complaint list.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:10.000\nMaybe that goes into a bragging column.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:13.000\nMustache absorption.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nBut I trimmed it now, and it's fine.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nMoving on.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nAny more complaints in here?\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.000\nLet's see here.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:28.000\nWell, here's a couple things.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nLast time I did this segment where I complained about things\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.000\nI'm not allowed to complain about,\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nI started talking about airports,\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:36.000\nbecause I wanted to get to this one thing I never got to.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nThey have these stupid machines.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nI talked about this yesterday.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nI went there yesterday at the thing, the podcast festival.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:49.000\nYour girlfriend and our producer.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nThere's one guy who raised his hand.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:52.000\nBummer for you.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nI'm just going to say everything again.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:58.000\nWhat's up with this Tyler Perry guy?\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nI'm making that up.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nWhat is up with this Tyler Perry guy?\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:03.000\nI've never seen him in anything.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:04.000\nI don't know.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:06.000\nHe's now in a movie.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nI don't know anything about Tyler Perry.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:12.000\nI saw the first, I think the first breakout, his clerks.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:13.000\nWhat was it called?\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:16.000\nMedea Diary of a Mad Black Woman, I think it was.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.000\nI don't know.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nSince then there's been several.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:22.000\nMedea has become the black Ernest.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nShe goes to camp.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:25.000\nShe goes to prison.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:26.000\nShe goes to hell.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.000\nShe goes to outer space.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nShe saves Christmas.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:31.000\nDoes she really?\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:33.000\nOne of those is true.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nI swear to God, I don't know which one,\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:36.000\nbut I know one of them is true.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:40.000\nShe has either saved Christmas or gone to prison.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nNo, I think both.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nDidn't Medea save Christmas?\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:44.000\nNo?\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nShe's gone to prison.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nShe's gone to prison for sure.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nBut did she save Christmas?\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:53.000\nAuntie?\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nYou can't just ask the one black audience.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:57.000\nI did it as a joke.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:00.000\nI knew he didn't know.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:01.000\nI bet he does.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nI bet he does.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nAuntie don't know nothing about no Tyler Perry.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:11.000\nAuntie don't truck with no Tyler.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nI was saying to Aaron in the car on the way over\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nbecause we drove past one of his billboards.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:18.000\nIt must have been rough if you were Tyler Perry's roommate.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:21.000\nYou know there's a lot of post-it notes in that fridge.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nGet it?\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:23.000\nNo?\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nProbably labels everything, you know,\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:30.000\nwhen his name is the...\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:34.000\nA guy gave a thumbs down and now is flipping me off.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nAnd he's wearing like a...\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:40.000\nIt's like a poncho polo shirt with a hood.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:44.000\nNow he put the hood up because he's gangster.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nI don't know what to make of you, sir.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nHe gave you thumbs up and then flipped you off?\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\nNo, he gave me thumbs down.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nAnd then I made eye contact with him\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:54.000\nand then he just started flipping me the finger.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nThis crowd is crazy.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:00.000\nHarmontown's crazy.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nOkay, so I don't know where to begin.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nTyler Perry...\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nBoy, that landed on its ass.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:06.000\nHang on.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nSo you were saying that Tyler Perry would say\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nthis is Tyler Perry's mustard or Tyler Perry's...\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:11.000\nYeah, it's funny.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nIt was too much of a dot connector.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\nYou know who probably loved that?\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:18.000\nAdam Goldberg probably loved that.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:22.000\nIt was an ass burger joke.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:25.000\nOr as you call it, ass burgers.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:32.000\nAdam Goldberg just hangs out now, which is fine, I guess.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nHe's a weirdo.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nHe's a lovable weirdo.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:38.000\nI'm a misfit.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:42.000\nHarmontown is about founding a colony of misfits.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:45.000\nAdam Goldberg should have some kind of statue of him somewhere\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\non the moon if we get there.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:48.000\nBut he was hanging out.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:51.000\nHe just popped by the drawing room, our watering hole,\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:55.000\nand we were hanging out with Eric Idle from Monty Python fame.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nI had to list his credits.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nEric Idle from Monty Python.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:04.000\nFrom European vacation.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:10.000\nJeff is friends with this comedy icon legend,\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nand we were hanging out with him at our local watering hole,\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.000\nand Adam Goldberg was there.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nSo we ended up at my house hanging out,\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:24.000\nand Adam Goldberg was leaving the house at the same time as Eric Idle,\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:27.000\nand we were like, ah, everybody, goodnight, goodnight everybody, goodnight.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nAnd Adam turned to Eric Idle and said, hey, it was really nice to meet you.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:38.000\nDo you have a card?\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nWait, he just kind of...\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nHe just stormed the stage.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nHe just stormed the stage.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:48.000\nI think there's something to be mined from the encounter\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:52.000\nwith what I thought was just a cool old British dude.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:56.000\nI didn't come here in June to be like,\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nI'm going to involve myself in Dan Harmon's life,\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nbut now that I'm...\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:03.000\nHe just stormed the stage and grabbed a microphone.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nI've been impugned, Jeff.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nIt's a quirky story about you.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nDid you deny any part of that story?\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nLet's flash back.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nI have spent...\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\nBecause I can kind of show the tapestry\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nof what you've accused of Asperginess.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:23.000\nI would much prefer, if we said the word personality,\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:26.000\nI'd like to think that all the social awkwardness is earned\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nrather than diagnosed, which is the only reason I've said,\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nI don't have Aspergers on all the various shows\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nwhere I have defended not having Aspergers.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:35.000\nSo...\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nWhat do you have?\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nI'd like to say a great personality\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:42.000\nwith attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nwhich is treated to medication.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nWhat do you... what do you... what, Ritalin?\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\nOkay, yeah, yeah.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nCan I have some?\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:51.000\nYeah, sure. We'll talk later.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nI'm not going to...\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nThis is going to be the first live drug deal via podcast.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nYou know, Season 2 of Community,\n\n09:58.000 --> 09:59.000\nheard of it?\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:00.000\nYeah.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nAdderall, baby.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nYeah.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\nChewing it like candy.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nIt's the candy that lets you focus.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nI can say it now. Let that go down for my biopic.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nThat was the Johnny Cashier.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:16.000\nI don't think you're a fool on anybody.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nHoly smokes.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nDan, have a seat.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:20.000\nHave a seat?\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nYeah, let this guy take all.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nThis is him.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:29.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Adam Goldberg!\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.000\nGoldberg Town.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:33.000\nIt's time for us to the regular segment of Harmontown\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:37.000\ncalled Goldbergia.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nGoldberg, Berg.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nNo one online got any of that.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nThey should have put their money on the barrel,\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:47.000\nput it in the incinerator.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:50.000\nSo, it's Wednesday night, a few weeks ago.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:54.000\nI'm killing it.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nI'm killing it in the exposition.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nI'm killing it.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:01.000\nI go down to House of Pies for a Meetup.com\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\ninspired game of Cards Against Humanity.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:05.000\nAnd Pies.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nI met the creators of that game.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nYeah, they're going to love that cheap plug.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nSorry, I didn't mean to derail you.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nNo, it's a conversation.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nI'm not an oddity. I'm a weirdo.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:20.000\nYou can touch the display animal or whatever this is.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nNobody feels sorry for you.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:25.000\nThank God, because that would take a long time.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nSo, I go over to the drawing room.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nI'm like, House of Pies does not serve liquor\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:31.000\nall they shouldn't.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:32.000\nGo over there.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:35.000\nAnd I see Jeff chatting with our dear friend Kate\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nand the cool...\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nYes, please.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nJust for the sake of...\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:49.000\nJeff went to get a drink for himself.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:54.000\nAnd Adam, who doesn't have Asperger's at all,\n\n11:54.000 --> 12:00.000\nsomehow interpreted Jeff getting a drink as an offer.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nSure thing, Mr. Goldberg.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nOffer to get him a drink.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nOh, you've Tyler parryized it now.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nOh, my God.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nYou're a tire, sir.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nThank you, Hope.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nAll right, so you're at House of Pies.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nI was like, I need to drink some liquor\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nto balance out the good decisions\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:25.000\nI've been making all night, playing four hours of an offensive card game.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\nGo over there.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:29.000\nI meet Jeff, meet some of our good friends over there.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nAnd it's his birthday.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nIt was here, birthday celebration.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:34.000\nPre-birthday, yeah.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:38.000\nAnd there was the coolest British guy I've ever half-talked to\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:42.000\nbecause couldn't really hear much of anything at the bar.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nI think he introduced himself and said,\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nmy name is...\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nI was like, that's great.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nI'll wait until someone uses it in conversation later,\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nwhich never happened.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nSo after impressing...\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nThis is the thing, this is the angle you're playing where you...\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:57.000\nI didn't know shit.\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:00.000\nYou didn't know it was Eric Eidel the whole night.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:03.000\nWhich is, that looks bad on me.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nI'll admit, that was a mistake.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nI think it's, I don't think it's true.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:09.000\nI know, I just thought, you were dead.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nDid it seem like I knew what was...\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:14.000\nIt never seems like you know what's going on.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:17.000\nOh yeah, you seem so irrationally impolite.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nLike you couldn't pick up on social cues.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nSo you must not have known who I was\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:26.000\nor like you were just being yourself in meeting Eric Eidel.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nAt what point you pulled out your phone\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nand started reading at the top of your lungs\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nan anti-war poem off of your phone.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:36.000\nOne, it was a loud slam poetry voice.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:40.000\nTwo, I am normally loud anyway, so that's hard to distinguish.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nEric Eidel like...\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:42.000\nHe really liked that poem.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nI know, I remember looking over at Eric Eidel,\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nhe had his head bowed and he was just nodding,\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:49.000\nlistening to it like he was in a beat, like a poetry slam.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:53.000\nI like to think that one of the rudels also liked that poem.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:56.000\nI would like to think that my 10-year-old self\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\ncould randomly look through a portal\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nand see me sitting in a living room\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:04.000\nwith a guy on a velvet couch looking at a hologram phone\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:09.000\ngoing, but my war is not your war, brother.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nScreaming at the top of his lungs with Eric Eidel\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nnodding his head in the corner.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:19.000\nThat's the only glimpse you get of your 39-year-old life, Dan Harbin.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:22.000\nYou know who the ruddles are, but you don't know Eric Eidel.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.000\nI would recognize him much more.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nIt was a mistake on my part,\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:31.000\nbut to think all older Englishmen look like Eric Eidel\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nis equally biased.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:39.000\nI think that when I started laughing at you,\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\nyou asked him for his card.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nI said he doesn't have a card, he's Eric Eidel.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nThat's when I knew him as Eric Eidel.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:52.000\nAnd then you went, oh, oh, not by virtue of a natural ability\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:56.000\nto pick up on it through empathy,\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nbut now because it's been pronounced.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:01.000\nI've misstepped, and then you texted Aaron and said,\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nsorry about that, I didn't know he was Eric Eidel all night.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nI'm going to go ahead and call.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:08.000\nMy theory is that that's a little damage-control\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:11.000\nGoldbergian horseshitery.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:14.000\nAnd everyone's going, oh, Adam Goldberg's anything,\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:17.000\nif not honest, like he's an honest person.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.000\nYou got Aaron's phone number,\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:23.000\nso you could send her that text.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:27.000\nThe way you got her phone number was by saying,\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nhey, Aaron, I was there when you did this.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nHe said, hey, Aaron, I lost my phone.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nMy phone broke.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nI didn't go, what was your number again?\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nAnd she gave it to you, and then we walked away.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nShe's like, he never had my number.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nBoth true, both true.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nYou're a diabolical...\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nAnd I lost my phone.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nYou're diabolical.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:51.000\nHey, I think it's just been a long con,\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:54.000\nthis whole personality thing that you've been faking,\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\njust to slowly take over Harmontown.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:00.000\nHe's not an unintelligent man, obviously.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:03.000\nWe know that.

artifacts.\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nI don't know about that.\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nI would have an arc to my wedding.\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nI would want to be a protagonist.\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nI would learn how to get married.\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000\nI would start by going\n\n01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nthis is bullshit.\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nAll I need is my blaster on my side.\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nI don't believe in no force.\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nSo you're just going

plane.\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000\nI believe in the force now.\n\n01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000\nBelak.\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000\nYeah, it would be a Harrison Ford wedding.\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nWould you get a bullet in the brain\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000\nand forget how to love?\n\n01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nYeah, that would be the second act.\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nRitz.\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nOne of our men would come and kill your wife\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nas soon as you were married.\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nI didn't kill my wife.\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nIn all seriousness,\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nI would like to have\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nsomething to the ceremony where\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nthey say speak now or forever.\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nYeah, they do that business.\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nIt's become a joke now.\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nBut it would be nice to have somebody come in\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nthat was dressed\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000\nas a purple monster or something\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nand go like, I don't want this wedding\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000\nto happen.\n\n01:05:50.000 -->

if I have anything to do with it.\n\n01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nThen you wrestle in the aisle.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nThat would be cool.\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nSo you're saying you're never going to get married?\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nI just need to find a woman\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nwho's willing to have her brother\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000\ndress like a purple monster.\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nDo you envision yourself being married\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nat any point?\n\n01:06:14.000 -->

romantic?\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nI just want it for the tax benefits.\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nWe don't picture ourselves dying either,\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nwe know what's going to happen.\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nIt just happens.\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nEverybody gets married.\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nYeah, eventually.\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nBabies don't get married.\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nSometimes they die.\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nSometimes a baby dies\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nwithout ever knowing what love is.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nOh, I'm lying?\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nIt's truth.\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nCemetery's are full of unmarried, dead babies.\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nIt's true.\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nOnce again, I'm...\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nI don't approve of this.\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nIt's horrible.\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nThey should have thought about that.\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000\nI brought this up for some reason.\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nI can't remember what it was.\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nWe went on a ghost tour.\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nWhy did they bring this up?\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000\nWe were in North Carolina.\n\n01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nWe were there for the wedding.\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nYou went on a ghost tour.\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nWe went on a ghost tour.\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nWe went on a walking ghost tour of Asheville.\n\n01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nWas it a ghost adventure?\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nIt was a ghost adventure.\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nIt was like a ghost hunter thing.\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nWere there two guys with tribal tattoos next to you?\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000\nNo, it was just this hippie lady\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nwith more socks and sandals and a windbreaker.\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nWas it outside?\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nBecause they don't have any money,\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nso you're just walking around just pointing at buildings.\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nEverybody goes, get out of here.\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nShe's like, I don't know what his problem is.\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nYou keep pointing at his church\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nand telling people that someone got murdered there.\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nLike, beat it.\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nGet a job, you hippie.\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nShe should say that those guys are ghosts.\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nThis house is haunted by a guy that hates you on his property.\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nShe did try to characterize that\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nand other things as paranormal.\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nWe walked past a place and she's like,\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nevery business that opens here\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000\ngoes away within two weeks.\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nI'm like, yeah, there's no parking.\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nIt's a terrible location.\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nIt's not a ghost story.\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nGhost hunters traipsing through your property.\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nIt's like the ghost of our economy\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nis haunting.\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000\nI'm like, oh, Rada, this is still trickling down\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nfrom the Reagan days.\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nShe gave Aaron\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nan actual meter\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nand said,\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nthese detect ghosts.\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nAlso,\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nI don't know,\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nI don't know,\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nI don't know,\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nAlso electricity\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nand water\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nand temperature variation.\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nSo, you know, use your own discretion.\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nIt really is just like a random\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nit is next to a building.\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nI got a ghost building\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000\npower line fire hydrant or sidewalk here.\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nSo that was her tool.\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nBut she looked the most like a ghost buster\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000\non that thing because at least it was beeping\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nand lighting up.\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nI got a thermometer.\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nOne of those laser thermometers.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nShe gave it to me.\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nTemperature variations can't,\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nwhen there's ghosts, it can be very cold\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nand all this stuff.\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nSo a thermometer can actually be a valuable thing.\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nI'm down with that.\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nI'd never had one of these laser thermometers\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nand I pointed it across the street and was like,\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000\nhey, how do these things work anyway?\n\n01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nI don't mean how do they detect ghosts.\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nHow do they read temperature\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000\nfrom across the street?\n\n01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nThat's really wild. She's like, you know what?\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000\nI don't really know.\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000\nI thought that was hilariously funny.\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000\nYou're giving me a thermometer\n\n01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000\nand saying you can use it to detect ghosts.\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000\nHey, how does it work as a thermometer?
