00:20.000\nMusic\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:21.000\nPretty groovy\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:30.000\nHarmontown is now in session\n\n00:30.000 --> 00:42.000\nSpencer Crankton, everybody, Spencer\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:58.000\nThank you\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:01.000\nWe've had a string of some pretty action-packed episodes\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:03.000\nWe've had a lot of crazy guests\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:06.000\nWe've had too much show for too many shows\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:09.000\nSo let's slow it down tonight\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:12.000\nLet's just relax and have a bad show\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:15.000\nBecause we're all tired\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:18.000\nAnd there's nobody coming\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.000\nAnd I don't have anything to talk about\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:22.000\nI came here directly from the Great Minds set\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:23.000\nAs did you, Spencer?\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:29.000\nYes, yes, we did\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:32.000\nToday we shot with Gillian Jacobs from Community\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:37.000\nShe played Ada Lovelace, the mother of programming\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:40.000\nAda Lovelace, or is it Lovelace?\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:42.000\nAda Lovelace\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:44.000\nNo, Ada Lovelace\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nDo the British pronounce Lovelace Lovelace?\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:50.000\nI think they pronounce a lot of things a lot of ways\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:53.000\nAll I know is she's the mother of modern computing\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:56.000\nShe wrote the very first lines of code\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:59.000\nYeah, the first algorithm\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:02.000\nThere were no computers yet, she wrote an algorithm\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:05.000\nYou go, girl!\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:09.000\nThat's all I got\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:12.000\nI still, you know, some classic observations\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:16.000\nI still wish they made a pill that could make your fingernails stop growing\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:20.000\nI'm just never going to clip these things on schedule\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:22.000\nWhat else is going on?\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:26.000\nBoy, that vice president's up those old tricks\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:29.000\nYes, Jeff?\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\nDo you have really long fingernails right now?\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nYou know, they're dirty, gross claws\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nYou should bite them\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:37.000\nI don't want to get a bite\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:38.000\nBite them\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:41.000\nNo, I've never been tempted to do that\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:42.000\nDo it\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:43.000\nNo\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:45.000\nDo it right now\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:46.000\nNo\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:48.000\nDo it in front of this audience\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:51.000\nThis is exactly how the Donner party started\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:54.000\nIt was cold and they were locked in a cabin\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nSomeone's like, ah, God, I'm sorry\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nYou should bite your nails, Gloria\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nBite them, bite them, now keep biting\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nNow let us help\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:05.000\nI'm Gloria Donner\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:08.000\nThe first person eaten\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:11.000\nAt the Donner party\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:19.000\nYou guys saw that Hannibal prequel where they, uh, yeah, alright\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:23.000\nWhere they like walk you through how, yeah, I've talked about that\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nThe Donner party thing reminded me of that\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nBecause essentially part of Hannibal's, Hannibal Lecter's origin\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:32.000\nIs that he's like a little kid under the table at an Ursatz Donner party\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:35.000\nThat he's like under a table watching\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nThat's his first experience in life is that sometimes people eat people\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:42.000\nLike they walk you through bit by bit, piece by piece\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:46.000\nLike how you could become Hannibal Lecter from being you\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:49.000\nThey remove all the fun out of the character\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:52.000\nIt's just like, hey, could happen to you, you could be Hannibal Lecter\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nHe's not Peter Parker\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:59.000\nWe weren't going to that for that\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:02.000\nHe was bitten by a radioactive hungry person\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:08.000\nI could give you some iPad app recommendations\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:10.000\nThey're not funny ones though\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:14.000\nI don't want to start any more beefs with any more Franko's\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nI'm playing a game called Knights of Pen and Paper 2\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I played the first one\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:26.000\nIt's a great sequel to a great, if you like, role-playing games and like turn-based combat\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\nIt's that\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nIt's that and it's a great sequel\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:33.000\nWhat classes are you running, Dan, for the people at home?\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:41.000\nI have a lab rat wizard\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:46.000\nBoy, don't, I have a goth\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:49.000\nA goth girl like a\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nThat's not a class\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nSortie herder\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:00.000\nShe's got a big sword, I think she's a\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nEspecially, especially, you play the game too, I know\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nI've played it, yeah, yeah\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:08.000\nWhat do you, what do you play?\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nWhat are your characters?\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nYou don't have a camera over there\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:16.000\nSchrab's doing a thing\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.000\nIs there any camera that can see that?\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:30.000\nJeff just closed the door on Schrab\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nSorry, I'm going to fill you in on the backstory\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:38.000\nThe show has a phantom zone and\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:42.000\nOur general zods are sentenced there when they\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:45.000\nTry to usurp the son of Krypton\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:48.000\nNow he's sulking, he's sulking\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nAlright, alright, let's bring him out\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nRob Schrab's here again\n\n05:52.000 --> 06:06.000\nOh, damn it!\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:20.000\nHey, Rob\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nHello\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nHow you doing, man?\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nI'm doing alright, Jeffrey, how are you?\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nI'm fair to Midland\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:32.000\nWhat's, uh, take us to your day, Rob\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nWhat'd you have for breakfast?\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nHmm, hmm\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nWhat did I have for breakfast?\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:43.000\nI had, um, um\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nAre you a breakfast guy?\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nNot really, no, I have a, I have a\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nHow come every time someone dies\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nYou text me that you love me?\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nAm I supposed to say I love you too?\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nWhat, was it Prince?\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nWow, I don't want to say it's personal, actually\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nWe lost a friend's\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nI'm giving you a through line for your biopic\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nIt's just a runner, is that?\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nBut is it, am I supposed to, is it after I die\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nOr people go, he should have, he should have\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nHe should have loved Schrab back\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nIt's like, you know\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nWas it Patton's wife?\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nWell, Jesus\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nYes, there was a death, there was a death\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nClose to the, close to the dex\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nAnd, uh, every time though\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nI'm saying it doesn't matter, it's a famous person\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nIt's a friend, it's like every time\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nI love you, you should take better care of\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nWell, you don't say you should take better care of yourself\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nI did, I did once\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nBut you're like, I'm really concerned\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nThe subtext is that I'm doing something wrong\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nBy living\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nNo, that is not, that is not\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nNo\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nWhat is it, what is going on there?\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nI want you to know I love you\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nAt those moments\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nRobin Williams dies, I love you Dan\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nYeah\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nDavid Bowie, I love you Dan\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nPrince\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nPrince\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nWhat do you, what do you think I'm going to do?\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nHave a platinum record?\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nI wish you would write better records\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nFirst\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nI just, I just\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nIn those moments\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nWhen you lose something special\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nYou know, you just, you start\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nTaking account\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nOf\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:36.000\nYou shouldn't be insulted by it\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nOr offended or hurt\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nI'm confused by it\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nI feel like the audience just\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nOdd and then laughed at themselves\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nAnd they were right\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nFair enough\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nNo, no, we got this bit going on\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nThat we don't like each other\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nAnd I want you to know that it's not true\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nWell\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nWhen someone special dies for you, Rob\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nYou think of the people special close to you\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nYeah\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nAnd you think of maybe the distance\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nThe gulf between you and Dan\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nThere's a lot of gulf\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nThat go closer together\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nYeah, which look at, look at physically\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nHow I could\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nCould not be further away\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nYou could scoot, you could scoot two stools closer\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nYeah, no\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nWell, what, what, okay, okay\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nI can't do this\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nWell\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nWe don't have a show, so why don't we do\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nA little holodeck scene where\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nYou're not working\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nOn the Lego 2 movie for seven and a half years\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nAnd I'm not working on\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\n950 projects for 900 years\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nOh, wow, biggest fan\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nI'm getting the fuck out of this shit\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nI've seen the hologram\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nBeck\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nFuck that\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nTomorrow morning's blog entry starts\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nI have colitis\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nIt's hard\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nI struggle with it all the time\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nAnd my entire life people have been asking\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nWhy are you going to the bathroom\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nColitis\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nI'm getting the fuck out\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nAll right, so where do we take us\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.000\nTo the holodeck\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nWhere do we fade in?\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nIt probably takes a lot of fucking\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nIf you sit in the front row and you have to\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nGet up, it probably, you're probably like\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nHoly shit, she's probably already\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nBeen through the whole thing\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nOf like, god damn it\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nI'm gonna have to do it, I'm gonna have to get up\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nShe's like an old timey reporter\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nWhere she has to go to the phone booth and go\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nOh my god\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nI got a hot story\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nAll right, yeah, no\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nThere's Schrab.every time\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nSomeone dies, I get a text\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nI'm trying to give you\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nLike an Edward runner\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nBella Lagosi calling\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nWhat are you setting up biopics for?\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nJust love me\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nI'm trying, dude\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nBut you're putting me on the spot\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nLittle bad\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nLet's holodeck it, okay, let's holodeck\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nLet's pretend\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nLet's holodeck it out\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nLet's holodeck like we used to\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nLet's holodeck it, give me some water\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nThrow me that one in the middle, all right, thanks\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nAll right\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nOkay, there we go\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nDon't make it that kind of show\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nIt's not\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nIt's supposed to be a thoughtful show\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nThis came here because we rejected\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nThe concept of catching something is important\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nIt's about connection, Dan\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nIt's about human connection\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nAll right, so if we're gonna holodeck it\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nWhere do you want to fade in\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nInto this holodeck?\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nShe's back\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nShe's back\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nShe's wiping her seat down\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nShe spilled cranberry juice\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nShe spilled cranberry juice, Dan\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nIt's not that big of a deal\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nShe's wearing black\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nWho cares?\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nShe's spilling cranberry juice, Dan\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nWe all know it's not that big of a deal\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nI know that's code for period\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nOh shit, is that right?\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:22.000\nYes, I've got my cranberry juice\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nAll right\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nI have to go to the bathroom\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nI haven't had a girlfriend in so long\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nI don't know this\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nI don't know these code words\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nAll right, so holodeck\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nFriendship with Schrab\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nWhere are we fading in to solve these problems?\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nThis is programmed to make me look bad\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nNo, no, it's programmed to call your bluff\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nBecause when I get a text that says\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nI love you, only when people die\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nIt's like to me\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nThe unspoken thing\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nIs like, we don't see each other enough\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nWe don't have a close enough relationship\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nYou eat too much, you drink too much\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nBut I've said that\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:00.000\nHere, out loud, I've said those words\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nI don't have to have\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nI don't have to do some kind of sleight of hand with a text\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nI say that to your face\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nYeah, so why can't you just text Prince died?\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nI write\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nRIP Prince\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nWhat do you want?\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nThen you say, I love you, Dan\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nIt's like so loaded\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nOkay, well, fine\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nWhat do you...\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nNo, I sound like a dick\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nGun to your head, what do you want?\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nYou want me to stop too?\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nAh, fuck you\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nNo, gun to your head, you want me to keep doing it\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nAlright, look, gun to your head\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nVirtual fishing boat\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:48.000\nVirtual fishing boat\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nShut up, shut up you scared the fucker\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.000\nShut up\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nShut up, you scared the fish\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nShut up\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nIs that the soundtrack?\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nIt's a whale\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nIt's foggy\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nIt's foggy\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nSo it's good that we finally got this moment\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nAlone\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nTo be best friends\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nFishing together\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nSo that we can finally hang out\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nAnd love each other\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nRetired and this is it\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nThank God\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nNone of us worked really hard until we dropped dead\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nWithout warning\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nThank God we did that\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nNow we can enjoy this sunshine\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nAnd this fish\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nThink of...\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nThink of what we would have...\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nI mean, oof\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nI made you something\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nYeah\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nYeah\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nClose your eyes\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nHold out your hand\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nIt's my shit\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nThe fuck\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nWhat the fuck, what the fuck\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nJetski\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nIt's detachable\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:52.000\nSon of a bitch\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nNo, no, no, no\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:06.000\nHelicopter\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nSay you don't love me anymore\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nStop telling me you love me\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:32.000\nI love you, dad\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nI wrote it\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nI did\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nI'm so sorry\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nI'm just gonna land some of my angel wings\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nDon't have to\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nFlap so much\n\n16:54.000 --> 17:04.000\nCan we get back to fishing, please?\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:08.000\nDad killed you and you still want to hang out with him and fish with him?\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.000\nI put shit in his hand\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nHe killed himself\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nYeah\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nI gave him an out\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nAlright, that didn't work\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nAlright, well I hope you enjoyed\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nThis level of show\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nAlright, next guest\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nDo you not want to be loved by Rob?\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nYou just don't want to be loved when people die\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nAnd that's when you feel loved by him most\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:38.000\nMakes him uncomfortable, it makes him uncomfortable to hear\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:42.000\nAre you loving him more when famous people die than other ones?\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nNo, when anybody dies\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nWhen just death is happening\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:52.000\nI'm like that with Kate, I'm like that with Lolly, I'm like that with a lot of people\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:58.000\nAnd Dan, you feel you don't want to be loved only when mortality is the thing\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nMakes him uncomfortable, it makes him uncomfortable\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nWell, he doesn't put anyone\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nThe same thing with my mom\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:08.000\nShe'll like send me a direct tweet or something\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nAnd it'll say like, be nice to hear from you now and then\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:14.000\nLike, bitch, you got my number\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nText me\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nI called her bluff, I said you can text me anytime\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nWell, I wouldn't want to bother you\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nBother me, she never does\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nShe doesn't text me\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nBut do you want her to?\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nI don't know\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nI don't know\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nI've text you, what up, what up man?\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nWhat's going on man?\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nWhat do I do?\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nYou don't write back\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nYou don't have to scratch your head\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:48.000\nYou're in workaholic mode where like you're busy as a mother fucker all the time\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nYeah, you got no time\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:54.000\nYou have the best excuse to not reply because you're always working, you have the best out\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nI get it\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nAlso sometimes they put his phone in a box\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nYeah\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nSay what?\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:06.000\nSometimes like a small man comes and puts his phone into a box\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nAlright\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nHis name is Steve Levy\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:14.000\nRob, are you a fan of the horror film genre?\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nYes, I am actually, yes\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nDo you like cinema?\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nI like cinemas, yes, I like them\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:24.000\nWell, our next guest\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:28.000\nIs, he played the, I think the most recent Jason Voorhees\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nYes, he did\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:34.000\nI think he must have done a terrible job because they kind of like, they stopped making those movies\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:38.000\nI think he must have killed people wrong\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nI think he killed him\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:44.000\nHe killed everybody in the movie, he was too good\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nOh, he's too good\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nHe hunted himself to extinction\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:52.000\nYeah, every Jason Voorhees movie has to, alright, okay\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nWell, he's an old friend of ours\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:58.000\nAnd I don't think he's ever been up on this podcast, just hanging out\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:02.000\nDon't look at me, you know the roster better than I do\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nPlease welcome Derek Mears\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:14.000\nYeah!\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:26.000\nOh, shit\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:30.000\nDerek\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:34.000\nI just spilled my cranberry juice\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:38.000\nYeah, come on over on this side of the stage there\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:42.000\n195, episode 195\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nOh yeah, we're coming up on 200, we should do something special\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nYeah\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nFor that episode\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\n195\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:54.000\nI wanted to do a gag tonight where I get so mad at Schrab, I'm chasing him around like some crates\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:58.000\nAnd then he runs behind a crate, and then you come out the other side\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:02.000\nAnd it just puts me off of chasing Schrabs forever\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:06.000\nDon't tell the audience, it's gonna be great, let's do it\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:10.000\nHow come that Harmon hates Schrabs so much?\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:14.000\nIt's an old Looney Tunes joke\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:18.000\nJust smiling him politely, Niley\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:26.000\nFor the crowd here that doesn't know our origin story, we know Derek, all of us, Dan, Rob and I, through comedy sports\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nWe're Bakersfield comedy sports\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nYeah\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nRob and Dan were Milwaukee\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nMilwaukee\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nI was LA and we all met at certain tournaments\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:40.000\nAnd we all met, like, remember sitting with Derek Mears\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:44.000\nI'll talk to you in the first person\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:48.000\nSitting with Derek and we saw the Bert Fershner's play in Milwaukee\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nAnd you and I sat next to each other\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:56.000\nAnd it was like Mike Rock, Chris Thom, and all of our New York friends\n\n21:56.000 --> 22:00.000\nAnd we saw something so funny that you and I looked at each other like, fuck this shit\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:04.000\nWe were actually unhappy at how funny things were\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nYeah, they were too good\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nAnd Rob and Dan were in The Dead Elwives\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:12.000\nAnd again, these guys are funnier than we are, so fuck it\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nThey're like, go home, we're done, totally done\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nOh, you were watching us?\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nYeah\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:22.000\nYou saw something so funny that you were like, let's quit forever\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:26.000\nAnd those things were Dan Harmon\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:30.000\nWell, actually\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:34.000\nI thought Sean McKenna was the funniest Dead Elwives\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nIt's true\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nBecause he was the most punk rock\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:42.000\nYou guys were all funny, you guys were all hilarious, but he was so dangerous and so weird\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:46.000\nI came from LA comedy sports, which was so safe\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:52.000\nSo by the numbers, these guys were actually punk rockers in the improv world\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:58.000\nAnd we all ended up hanging out on the sidelines and becoming friends\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:04.000\nAnd my friendship with Rob, Dan, all you guys coincided with Derek Mears\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:08.000\nDo you guys think Kanye West gets a bad rap?\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:16.000\nI feel like everybody...\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:18.000\nHe does a good rap, too\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:24.000\nHe's never, as far as I know, he's never hit anybody or abused anybody\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:28.000\nAnd he's got seven number one albums in a row\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:32.000\nWe keep waiting for him to become humble or normal\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:36.000\nI think he's just a lunatic, right?\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nHe's got seven number one albums in a row\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nI think a lot of it's just a big show\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:44.000\nKind of like an Alice Cooper, Marilyn Manson on the metal side, but on the hip hop side\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:48.000\nHe does things just to get people's mindset and to be in the consciousness\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nYeah\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nYou know what he just did though?\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nWell, he didn't just do it, he did it a while ago\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:58.000\nHe was like, my album's always gonna be on title, only title forever\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nAnd then it wasn't\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:06.000\nSo like a lot of people subscribe to title under false pretenses\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nAnd now there's a class action lawsuit or something\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nWhat? What?\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:14.000\nTitle, the subscription program or thing, service\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:18.000\nMusic streaming subscription by Jay-Z, right?\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.000\nI don't know anything about that\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nHe's got all this talent, right?\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nHe's trying to get talent on his side\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nKanye's like, it's only gonna be on title\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:29.000\nIf you want talent, it's gonna be on title\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nYou best subscribe\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nAnd then it comes out not on title\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nAnd everyone's like, well, what the fuck?\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:39.000\nWhat are we doing this for? We could just buy albums like normal people?\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nShit, well\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nStill, though, a lot of people hit women\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nYeah, no, no\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nAnd piss on people and stuff\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nThat's still not bad, I gotta say\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:53.000\nAnd I feel like if you're gonna tear up someone's floor of their set\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nYou just run it by them in their dressing room\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nJust go, hey, we gotta tear up the floor of your set\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nIt's mirrors\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nIt doesn't work for the cameras\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:05.000\nHe'd probably be like, okay, cool, I'm Picasso and Jesus\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nOkay, cool, we're SNL\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nGoodbye, but they didn't tell him\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nOf course he's gonna be like, what the fuck?\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nThey didn't even tell me, I'm Picasso and Jesus\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:17.000\nAnd someone's recording him from 50 yards going, this is the best\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:21.000\nAre you comparing yourself to Kanye or Jesus Ringer?\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:25.000\nWhat he's taught me is it doesn't matter\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:29.000\nWe should all be a little more proud of ourselves, for God's sake\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:31.000\nSeven number one albums\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:35.000\nFour albums ago is when he needed to stop being humble\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:38.000\nBy our own rules that we've established\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:43.000\nThree number one albums you're allowed to start wearing a shoe for a hat\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nWe established that a long time ago\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nAre you a big Kanye fan?\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:51.000\nI don't really like his music, but I like his personality\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:54.000\nYou just want permission to be Kanye West\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:58.000\nWell, no, I'm just defending a guy who's like, yeah\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:04.000\nIt's adorable that people were like\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:07.000\nThat lady was like, he sticks stuff in his butt\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:10.000\nAnd then it's amazing that he bothers to get on Twitter\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:13.000\nHe's like, come on, seriously, I don't like anything in my butt\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:20.000\nIt's him, it's not like a PR company going like, speaking of butt, go to Target\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:25.000\nIt's like him going like, come on, come on, y'all, I don't put anything in my butt\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:28.000\nIt's great, it's accessible\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:31.000\nIs this similar to how people don't like to drink alone?\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:34.000\nThe narcissism level, like, look at me, this is amazing\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:38.000\nAnd so he's that big, and you're like, I look up to him someday\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nI don't know, I don't know what that means\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:43.000\nI don't know where the insult begins\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nOh, no, it's playful, like a kitten insult\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nIt's not like I'm going to hurt you, stab you in the face\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:51.000\nWell, you can't, I'm like Picasso, you can't stab me\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:57.000\nYou'd be stabbing thin air, I'm Jesus\n\n26:57.000 --> 27:00.000\nSo you want to be Kanye, like you like\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nI am, I am, aren't I?\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nI am Kanye\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:08.000\nShould we holodeck this?\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:11.000\nHolodeck, just me being Kanye\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:14.000\nOkay\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:22.000\nAnd the winner for Best Musician for the MTV Music Awards is\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nYou want to read the envelope?\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:28.000\nShenane\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nAlright, put your ears and hands together\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:35.000\nIt's Kanye West\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:38.000\nYou know what?\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:41.000\nThis is bullshit, this is bullshit\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nTaylor Swift, get up here\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nTaylor, Taylor, get up here\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:48.000\nShe deserves this award\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nThis is bullshit, I didn't work my ass off\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:54.000\nTaylor Swift did\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nShe deserves it\n\n27:56.000 --> 28:02.000\nI didn't know what else to do with that\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:07.000\nTaylor, Kanye\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:10.000\nOh, oh, oh, oh, soul powers\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:19.000\nOh, you're so tasty, so delicious, Kanye\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nCut to black, Taylor\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nPentagon, 1978\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nPentagon\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:39.000\nOh, shit, went the wrong way\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nI think it's like, where is it?\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nIt's three lefts, two rights\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:59.000\nAlright, finally, I've been looking for you guys forever\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:03.000\nI went to a room, there was a guy\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:09.000\nSo anyways, we have a problem\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:14.000\nWell, we're the guys

suspected is my...\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:33.000\nYeah, we didn't put our all into that one\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:38.000\nOh, fuck, oh shit\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:42.000\nFire drill\n\n29:42.000 -->

29:51.000\nYou know, everybody says don't use an elevator, fuck that shit\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nLet's use the elevator\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:56.000\nYeah, yeah\n\n29:56.000 --> 30:00.000\nIt's in the way that you use it, doo, doo\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:05.000\nBelieve me, it's so much quicker than it was there\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:09.000\nSo how about what Sally was wearing today?\n\n30:09.000 -->

Pennies are gone\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:23.000\nDid the elevator stop and the doors not open?\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:27.000\nWe're only on the Quatra-Gone level\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:30.000\nPress the button again just in case\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:35.000\nIt's in the way that you use it, doo, doo\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:40.000\nThe buttons went up\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:44.000\nOkay, doo, fuck\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:45.000\nLet's go out\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nOh my god\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nThat doesn't mean anything\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:51.000\nThat doesn't mean anything, it means the doors are about to open\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nBecause they're trying to save electricity\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nWhat?\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nI don't want to freak you guys out\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nBut when the stuff like this happens, if I can't see things\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nI have little flashbacks as a child\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nAnd I start to get uncomfortable\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nAnd weird things happen\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nOkay\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:14.000\nCut to Derek's flashbacks as a child\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:22.000\nSon, happy birthday\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nThis is your new hammock\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nThanks, this is so comfortable\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nI've never had anything like this before\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nHey, Derek, fatty Derek\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nSnip, snip\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nNo, no!\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nGod damn it, no!\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nBack to the elevator\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nAnd she was really mean to me\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nAnd so that's what happened\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nShe called you fatty Karen?\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nShe had like a speech impediment\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nReally high-pitched voice\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nShe couldn't say my name right\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nDerek Karen Mears\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:00.000\nThe lights are still out, you guys\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nIf you don't know\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:05.000\nI've taken control of your elevator car\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nKanye West\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nYeah\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nYou have 30 seconds\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:20.000\nTo make the greatest rap album of all time\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nHe can do it!\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nHe can do it!\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nHe can do it!\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nYou're Jesus Picasso, you can do it!\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nYou can do it!\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nReally confined in here\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nYeah, well, we'll sit down\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nWell, no, that's...\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nAlright, that kind of...\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nAlright, okay\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nYeah\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nAw yeah\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nPut your elevator action together\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:01.000\nFor K.W.

lunch\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nBreak it to you slowly over mozzarella sticks\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nYou admitted yourselves\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nYou phoned it in\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nMozzarella stick\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nAh, get your own now\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nSo long\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nBut you should\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:24.000\nWhat's he doing with that apple?\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:27.000\nHe's eating it\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nIt's a nano-apple\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nSo long\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\nSuckers\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:48.000\nWasn't that nano-apple part of the Delta project?\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:53.000\nIt was, but I think he meant it to be achieved\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nA cheese dick\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nA cheese dick?\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nYes\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nWant to go back to giving me head?\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nCredits\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:21.000\nMusic\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\nWas it like that?\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nExactly\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:30.000\nCould we have a serious conversation for a second?\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\nDan, I love you\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nWho died?\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nThat scene\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nSpencer, how have you been?\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:44.000\nI've been so good\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nThere's something in\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nI know, you've been messing with it\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:51.000\nAnd looking at it for minutes\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nWhat do you think, what is it?\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:56.000\nDrink it, man, just drink it\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:59.000\nYou got some sort of weird thing in your vodka?\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:02.000\nThis is like the lowest-stakes creep show ever\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nI know it's in here, there's something\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nThere's just something down there\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nThere's some jewels or whatever it is, I got it\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:11.000\nOh, it's the reflection of my finger\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:14.000\nOh, no\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nYou're like a bird\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:27.000\nNo, it's still there, oh, but that's us, okay\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nOh, man\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:34.000\nI'm very phobic about impurities and stuff\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nYeah\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:39.000\nWhatever's in there, vodka will probably kill it, right?\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nYeah, yeah\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nOr the snakes will\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nI love you so much\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:50.000\nThank you\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:54.000\nDerek, tell us about getting kicked in the nuts by Will Smith\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nIn Wild Wild West\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:01.000\nOh my god, yeah, as an actor I was very lucky\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:05.000\nAt one point, one of my first jobs was working on the stellar hit\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nWild Wild Wild West\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nWild Wild West won\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nYeah\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:14.000\nDid you play the robot spider?\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:16.000\nAttack of the robot spiders\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:20.000\nYes, actually I was the giant metalhead guy inside the spider\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:24.000\nAnd I was super nervous because I had to hit Will Smith for the first time\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:28.000\nPunching him and whatnot, but he had to kick me in the nards as well\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:31.000\nBut when we were doing it, we had, when you get kicked in the nards\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:34.000\nYou get usually a safety strap that goes around your ankle\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:37.000\nAll the way up through here, kind of like a belt, so if someone hits you\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:40.000\nIt stops them from actually hitting your nard parts\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:42.000\nYeah, hold on, it gets good\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:45.000\nIt's like a hammock, upside down hammock\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nAbove the ground that is your nuts\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:48.000\nAbsolutely\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:50.000\nIt's supposed to hold the body that is Will Smith's ankle\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:55.000\nAs he does the plopping into it of kicking as hard as he can upward\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nAnd that is the correct term, plopping\n\n39:57.000 --> 40:01.000\nAs hard as he might try, if he kicks straight up in your dick\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nHe's not going to get there because it's attached to your feet\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:07.000\nCorrect, but if you go up at an angle, you get hit hard\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:08.000\nIn the thigh\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:14.000\nIn the upper groin area where the connection between your hoop and the hop come together\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:17.000\nAnd your nuts are huge\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:22.000\nThey're average man nuts\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:28.000\nBut you're bigger than an average man, so like you say like\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:35.000\nOh, this Diet Coke is average size, but it's like you drink a special giant Diet Coke can\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:39.000\nWait, how big are like, what's average nut size?\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nLike a quarter? Like is that a nut?\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nYeah, like a quarter\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:49.000\nSpencer's giant, he has to make it like two times my size of nuts\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:52.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah, but I'm special\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nAlso what do you have behind the show? Quality\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nQuality is the entire time\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:59.000\nSo anyways, the story that you're making me tell\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nWe did it about like\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:04.000\nI expected you to go, I don't want to talk about that\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:08.000\nAbout 20 takes happened, not one was straight up and they were side to side\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:12.000\nAnd I felt like a kickboxer because it got to the point where I kept getting kicked over and over\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:15.000\nAnd it's kind of like like Rocky where he like he'd start to buckle and be like\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:19.000\nWhen I was a kid, I was so new going, no, no, no, this is good, I keep going\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nHe's not kicking straight up, he's kicking into the thigh\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:22.000\nYeah, yeah\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nAnd you want it straight up\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:28.000\nI'm assuming not kicking you straight up because Instinct says\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:33.000\nIf I kick this guy as hard as I can straight up, that's going to be like kicking a human being in the balls\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nSo he's kicking you into the thigh\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:36.000\nYes\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nProbably to be a good person but he's doing it wrong\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:42.000\nCorrect, but he makes more than I do and he can hire me in the future\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:45.000\nHe did it completely right and it was my fault\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:50.000\nBut no, afterwards I had it just like just think of the blackest purple\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:55.000\nLike I went to the trailer and I kind of hobbled to the trailer and lay there and just had these giant\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:59.000\nLike volleyball size on both sides like bruises\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:04.000\nAnd the thing is when you're a young stuntman, like I think what you expressed to me is like\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:10.000\nYou're in this terrible dilemma because it's like you can't stop between the 30th take\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:15.000\nAnd by the way, I met the dude that was in an acting class\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nYes, believe it or not\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:20.000\nHe was in an acting class at Sam Christiansen's class\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:26.000\nAnd one of the classmates was the guy who played Marco in Die Hard\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:32.000\nWho is the guy who says, next time you're going to shoot somebody, don't hesitate\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:36.000\nThanks for the advice, oh\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:44.000\nThat guy, I'm sorry, but because I was thinking of that guy because he told me\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:49.000\nBecause he's a stuntman, a lot of the terrorists in Die Hard, they're just stuntmen\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:53.000\nBecause they had to do rolls and dives and tucks and nips and things\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:56.000\nAnd he's like\n\n42:56.000 --> 43:01.000\nSo racist\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:05.000\nA moment of silence for that moment of silence\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:15.000\nHe ruined his back during Die Hard, I think he never could do stunt work again\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:20.000\nBecause that was his biggest gig and it was the most benign thing you'd see in Die Hard\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:25.000\nThere's a moment when he's talking and then some dudes come in the doorway\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:31.000\nAnd he goes, they catch Bruce Willis off guard and he draws down on them\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:36.000\nAnd there's just a two second shot of the doorway and the guy's scatter\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:42.000\nAnd in that shot, Marco vaults over an office chair, does a little dive\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:46.000\nIt's not that big a deal, the movie's not called Rhythm Gymnastics Hard\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:50.000\nIt's not like, whoa, they'll blow you away with the wonderful cartwheels\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:53.000\nBut he did this move that he then had to do 46 times\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:56.000\nLiterally, I think they did 46 takes of that shot\n\n43:56.000 --> 44:01.000\nAnd he could never stop at take 23 and say\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:04.000\nI'm out, I can't do this, I'm going to ruin my body\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:07.000\nAnd you, Will Smith is kicking you in the nuts for the 18th time\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:13.000\nAnd you're faced with this crazy choice of like, well, what am I going to be the stuntman that's gotten this far\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:16.000\nAnd then goes, I can't take it, boys\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:20.000\nYou're allowed to at any point say, okay, I'm hurt\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:26.000\nBut if you do, they go, oh, shit, go home and we never hire you again\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:29.000\nYeah, I think if you're a veteran, you probably get away with it more, right?\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:34.000\nWell, the mentality between acting as stunts, it's white collar, blue collar\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:39.000\nOn the stunt side of things, like your job is to make the stunt winner who hired you look as good as possible\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:45.000\nSo if you ever get hurt or injured on set, you shouldn't as a professional scream out\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:48.000\nAnd go, ah, my arm is broken and I can't feel, you'd be very quiet\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:53.000\nAnd if you're hurt, you leave set so you don't cause that panic on set and people freak out\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:57.000\nBecause you'll interrupt the work day, then they don't make their day and then there's money involved and what not\n\n44:57.000 --> 45:02.000\nBut you go in, you take it, you wrap whatever hurt and you go back and you finish the job for the day\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:06.000\nIf your mentality's right and then you heal up later\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:10.000\nYou got pretty hurt, a separated shoulder or something like that?\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:15.000\nOh, no, no, I had a really bad herniated disc in my neck, it was the toughest job I've ever done\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:18.000\nI did Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters. I was just going to bring that up\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:24.000\nI couldn't wait to bring that up because I watched that entire movie, I thought that fucker was CG\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:31.000\nThat was you in a costume, that troll, that big ogre thing, there was two in a costume\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:36.000\nYeah, that was crazy, we shot three months in Berlin, the first week there\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:42.000\nAnything you do for these kind of monster jobs, because an actor, I bounce to my normal face and doing monsters from time to time\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:47.000\nBut anytime you do a monster job, you're always prepared ahead of time, like I always talk about a UFC fighter\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:50.000\nYou over train, so when you're on set, nothing's going to faze you\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:56.000\nBut the suit was so difficult because the studio wanted to CG the character and the producers and the director were finding\n\n45:56.000 --> 46:01.000\nNo, we want to do it practical, we have the right people and the right team together, let's do it practical\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:06.000\nAnd they're like, okay, we'll try it, but the suit was so big, I try to explain to people like when you put it on\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:14.000\nIt's like being on a treadmill with like a hundred plus pound of weight on your neck, shoulders, all over you\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:21.000\nYou're breathing your own carbon dioxide, so you can't breathe very well, your pulse is already, you're actually cooking inside the suit\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:25.000\nSo imagine that, putting a plastic bag on your head and running, blind\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:29.000\nAnd Will Smith kicking you in the nuts the entire time\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nBut yeah, it was crazy, I got to love it\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:34.000\nAnd he wasn't even on that job, he just shows up to fuck a kid\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:37.000\nWill Smith just fucking goes from set to set\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nWell, he became addicted to it, that's the thing\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nWhere'd you get a taste for it?\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:46.000\nHe started to make excuses in your head, I deserved it, I shouldn't have made him do that\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:49.000\nIt's called addiction, it's called addiction\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:54.000\nOn Will Smith's behalf, it was my first big Hollywood star going, oh my god, I don't want to ruin this\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:58.000\nHe was the nicest, most down-to-earth guy, I was talking to one of his entourage at the time\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:04.000\nIs he doing a game or is he legit, no no no man, Will Smith is Will Smith 24 hours a day\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:07.000\nAnd he treated, it didn't matter if you were the caterer all the way up to the main producer\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:12.000\nHe treated everybody equally with respect and I was blown away\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:13.000\nI went a lot from him\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:14.000\nAlright, now Derek\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:18.000\nYeah, sounds pretty cool\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:21.000\nSounds pretty cool\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:26.000\nI'd like to work with him someday\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:31.000\nDerek, am I getting this wrong, Derek and I used to be roommates for a while back in the day\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:32.000\nYeah\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:37.000\nAnd when you auditioned for that, they had you come in\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nFor Wild Wild West\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:40.000\nFor Wild Wild West\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:41.000\nOne\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:44.000\nAnd they did some kicks and stuff like that\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:50.000\nWasn't there a thing like they said, do like a high kick and you're like, no, I'll kick a hole in the ceiling\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:55.000\nNo, there's a small room or whatever and there's like a low hanging, my background's like martial arts and stuff\n\n47:55.000 --> 48:00.000\nAnd so they're like, go ahead and do, can you kick over your head and go, yeah, I can stop here\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:04.000\nI don't know why, because I'll kick the light thing, I don't want to do that\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:05.000\nAnd they're like, go ahead and do it\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:08.000\nYeah, yeah, honey, kick to it\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:11.000\nYou kicked the ceiling out and they're like, you got the fucking Jeff\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:16.000\nAlso on a side note, like being Jeff's roommate, talk about like\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:21.000\nYou, you, you\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:22.000\nTalk about\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:23.000\nIf you want to\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:28.000\nMotherfucker leaves the toilet seat up, the refrigerator door open\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:34.000\nIf you just moved to Hollywood and you're looking for self-confidence, don't move in with Davis\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:39.000\nThat guy is a, no, sweetheart of a human being, like Jeff's like a brother to me\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:46.000\nWell, all of his waking nightmares about 9-11, like\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:57.000\nI would date skinny, like weak, like, you know, thin actresses\n\n48:57.000 --> 49:04.000\nDerek would date giant, hard-ass stunt women who like, look like, like Xena, warrior princess\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:09.000\nSo I'd be in my little bedroom and we'd be like, maybe, oh, no\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nLike, you should eat something\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:16.000\nAnd that was him talking to me\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:17.000\nStunt talk\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:24.000\nAnd then from Derek's room, it was boom, come on, they were doing, like, you guys were wrestling so hard\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nFurniture was flying\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:27.000\nWrestling\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:31.000\nMe and my skinny actress girlfriend were like, well, are they okay?\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:36.000\nLike, yeah, they're, oh, I live with a superhero\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:44.000\nAlso, Derek would do a thing, first time we lived at the Serrano, like in the Koreatown\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:45.000\nYeah\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:48.000\nDerek, you know, he's, what are you, six?\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:49.000\nSix-five\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:50.000\nSix-five\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:55.000\nTotally hairless, very, very, very muscular\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:56.000\nHe's trying to create a picture for you\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:57.000\nYeah\n\n49:57.000 --> 50:01.000\nFor the home listener\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:02.000\nIt's a podcast\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:03.000\nKind of a Mr. Clean look\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:04.000\nIt's a podcast\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\nMr. Clean\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:12.000\nDerek would come out and, like, I'd be playing his PlayStation, I'd be doing some Tomb Raider or whatever\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:15.000\nAnd Derek would come out and his tidy whiteies\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:18.000\nAnd he would do this\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:19.000\nOh, boy\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nI called it the pretty prancer\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.000\nYou wanna come out with a photo?\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:25.000\nYou wanna come out of the bathroom?\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:30.000\nImagine him and naked, except for tidy whiteies\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:31.000\nAnd he would go like\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:42.000\nJeff\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:46.000\nJeff, am I a pretty prancer?\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:50.000\nYes, Derek\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:53.000\nYou're a pretty pony\n\n50:58.000 --> 50:59.000\nIt was the best\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.000\nOh, good times, good times\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:06.000\nBut the point I was trying to make with Jeff coming over\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:12.000\nWith Jeff as a roommate is, like, I would sit there and I had the same spot on the couch\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:17.000\nI was that friend, you know, who's, like, disheveled and like, oh, it's gonna play Tomb Raider on PlayStation 2\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:18.000\nIt was great\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:23.000\nAnd it was, like, a cat, like, a revolving door of, like, beautiful, hot, like, eccentric women would come in\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:27.000\nAnd, like, I would sit there and they're talking, like, Don Perignon\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:30.000\nI feel like the kid from Deliverance would be like, hey, what's going on?\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:34.000\nYou know, Jeff's a real funny dude, you should have a good time tonight\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:39.000\nBut they had to put up with me, because, like, you know, they're dating Jeff and then we were close\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:44.000\nLike, oh, you guys could have leaned into that, you could have done, like, just skin tight latex\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:48.000\nLike, on a Friday night, like, are you going out tonight?\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:53.000\nYeah, yeah, I'm gonna probably bring some women up, you want me to do the, you know, the thing?\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:54.000\nYeah\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nYou want me to just be in the cabinet under the sink?\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:03.000\nThat would be amazing\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:04.000\nAnd then you do your high kicks\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:08.000\nAnd then Will Smith comes out of a different cabinet, starts kicking in the nuts\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:11.000\nIs that Will Smith? He's really nice\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:14.000\nDerek, flat footed, flat footed, you could kick the ceiling probably here, right?\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:15.000\nI think I can\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:16.000\nStill?\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:19.000\nOh, well, I'm still, I'm tighter than I used to be, I could fall, it'd be awesome\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nYou got them tattooed or paint, pants on\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:25.000\nJust, try, try, I mean, I think, flat, oh yeah, you\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nHe's wearing jeans, whoa\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:29.000\nJesus Christ\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:30.000\nHe kicked it\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:31.000\nWhoa\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:32.000\nJesus\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:33.000\nJesus\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:34.000\nHe chopped it\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:35.000\nNice\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:36.000\nYeah\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nYeah, that must work\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:42.000\nGuys, if any sort of terror erupts, I got your back\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:43.000\nDan\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nDan's trying to kick it\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:48.000\nThis is a, this is a horrible idea\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:49.000\nGame recognized game\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:56.000\nDan\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:00.000\nNice\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nNice\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:06.000\nGreat\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:07.000\nGreat\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:14.000\nYou really are Picasso Jesus\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:21.000\nI was actually kind of curious, like how, like what the disparity is\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:24.000\nLike how, how far my leg goes up, I think it was like\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:31.000\nYou got pretty close\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:35.000\nWhat, yeah\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:38.000\nWhat, so\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:44.000\nSee, if you go to your chiropractor and it's like, oh, he's fixed your back\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:47.000\nAnd then he's like, have you done those exercises?\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nAnd you, you haven't\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nAnd then you, because you're busy\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:55.000\nAnd then you're like, if I just say no\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:58.000\nThen I, which I've already tried, I've tried to be honest\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nHe goes like, have you done those exercises?\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:03.000\nThey're like core exercises, like where you work your core\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nIt's for my posture\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nI don't like my posture\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:10.000\nBut I don't, I don't like doing the exercises either\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nSo my hands are tied\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:19.000\nSo, so I, like, so once a week I go into him and he goes like, he's adjusting my back\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nAnd then he goes, did you do those exercises?\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:25.000\nAnd then I tried, I already tried, I tried\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:31.000\nOh, okay, that's fine, that's the, that's the same as my alarm tone\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:34.000\nIt's worth, because we live in an Orwellian society\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:38.000\nIt's not like yours was going to be, it's in the way that you use it\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:46.000\nKevin Day is like, god damn it, fucking, that's Eric Clapton, fucking, it just gets sued\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:51.000\nThe, I don't do the, so I already tried, I tried going\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:55.000\nNo, by the way, now I'm not going to tell you his name\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:58.000\nBecause then you might yell at him and like harass him\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:00.000\nDr. X, Dr. X\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:03.000\nNo, Dr. X, by the way, X is his first name\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nBecause not a real doctor, chiropractor\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:08.000\nIt's like Dr. Todd, you know\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:12.000\nNo, Dr. Todd, I did not do the exercises this week\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:14.000\nI didn't do them\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:18.000\nAnd then his reaction is like, okay, well, can I ask you a question?\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\nDo you want to have better posture?\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\nYes, I do, Dr. Todd\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:26.000\nWell, you can't have it if I can't help you if you're, if you're going to\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:28.000\nBecause if you don't want to do it, then you don't want to do it\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:31.000\nWasn't he like, well, if you want, don't want to waste my time\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:34.000\nOr like something like, he was wasting your time\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:36.000\nWell, that's when I cancel an appointment\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:39.000\nHe was like, but it's like, I pay for the appointment\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:43.000\nOh, I thought he was like, you're not going to stretch, you're just wasting my time\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:47.000\nWell, he was like, well, if you don't, if you don't want to do it\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nLike, I don't know what to do with you\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:51.000\nAnd so then I tried lying a little bit\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nLike, so then the next time he goes like, do you know the exercises?\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:56.000\nI hadn't, and so I tried lying just enough\n\n55:56.000 --> 56:00.000\nBecause I didn't get the right, it was like, so I was like, yeah, a couple times\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:03.000\nHe's like, yeah, like, how often?\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:08.000\nI'm like, oh, here and there, like once every other day\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:12.000\nTrying a little bit, and then he said, well, I can't, you know\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:14.000\nLook, I mean, I want to help your posture, but I can't\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:16.000\nI can't work with you if it's like, oh, once every other day\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:19.000\nAnd I did an impression of my voice and like\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:24.000\nAnd it was like, I was just like, I got my face in a table while he's doing that shit\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:28.000\nAnd I'm like, I just like, I don't need to put up with this\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:31.000\nThis motherfucker's supposed to crack my back\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:34.000\nBut then I think, well, what if I stop going to him?\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:37.000\nAnd then my back feels bad\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:39.000\nAnd then you'll know he works\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.000\nThat seems like the best idea\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nAnd then he's like, I don't know\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\nLike I throw a pebble at his window\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:48.000\nDr. Todd!\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:54.000\nI hold up a boombox and it's playing the shitty music version of\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:59.000\nWhatever he plays over his fucking shitty new age sound system\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:01.000\nI'll touch you twice\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:04.000\nNow, have you tried actually doing his instructions and doing that?\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:05.000\nYeah, they're...\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:06.000\nLet's do them right now\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:07.000\nNo, they're on the...\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:09.000\nNo, don't applaud that\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:11.000\nNo, no, no, no, they'll applaud for this\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:12.000\nLet's do it\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:15.000\nI think if you did it right now, then you could be truthful\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:16.000\nYou don't like lying\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:17.000\nNo, I don't\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:22.000\nHe won't even accept, I already know that even if I did him a lot, according to me\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:23.000\nThat wouldn't be enough for him\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.000\nOkay, then definitely don't do him\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:26.000\nYeah, yeah\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:27.000\nStop it\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:28.000\nSo do I have to stop going to him?\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:29.000\nNo\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:30.000\nWhat?\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\nHe's trying to help you\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:35.000\nBut I don't have time to do the exercises, bro\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:38.000\nWait, what are the exercises and how long?\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:41.000\nLike 15 seconds\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:46.000\nI just got to lay down on the floor and go like this\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nIt's like for my core, I don't have a core\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:51.000\nDo it every time you have to pee\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:52.000\n15 seconds?\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:56.000\nYou can't even try it just as an experiment to see if he's a good decorator\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:59.000\nIf history is any teacher, no, I cannot, I'm not able to do it\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:02.000\nIt doesn't work into my schedule right now\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nI can't have Steve Levy put on my calendar\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:05.000\nDo it when you pee\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:08.000\nThrust your fucking hips for 15 seconds\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.000\nMy calendar already looks like this\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:12.000\nEvery day is like, what?\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:14.000\nRead the Bible\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:15.000\nWhat?\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nI have to do so much shit\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nThere's going to be slivers added in there\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nThrust your hips against the wall\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.000\nHave you cut Minecraft out of your schedule?\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:24.000\nDude\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:31.000\nYeah, is that Steve Levy?\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nYeah, I don't play no Minecraft\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nNights of pen and paper too\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:38.000\nI got a couple hours in yesterday\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:41.000\nI don't touch console games or laptop games\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:44.000\nI only do iPad time management games\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:46.000\nThey're teaching me time management\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nAre you still in pain? Is your back like...\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:51.000\nNo, that's the thing\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nSo why would I ever do these exercises?\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:54.000\nDon't go, don't go\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:56.000\nYou sound like you're busy\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:58.000\nYou sound so busy, Dan\n\n58:58.000 --> 58:59.000\nYou sound so busy\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nYou need to relax, take it easy\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:02.000\nDon't go\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:04.000\nIf you don't like him\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:05.000\nYou don't like him\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nYou don't like what he's telling you to do\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nStop it, just don't go\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nI worry about you, man\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:14.000\nDon't go, just stay home\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nWell...\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:22.000\nSteve, can you put on the calendar\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:24.000\nI'm supposed to lay on the ground\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:28.000\nThere's a piece of paper that shows a lady doing it\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:32.000\nIt's like, I got a...\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:34.000\nIt doesn't even make sense\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:36.000\nYou're talking about a breast exam\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nCan you show us how to fix it?\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\nNo, I can't, because it's a stage\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:41.000\nNo, I can't show you\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:42.000\nI'll describe it\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:43.000\nI'll describe it if you do it\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:44.000\nShow us what you're supposed to do\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:47.000\nIt's going to look like a man laying down\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nYeah, well, let's try it out\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:50.000\nBut if you do it in the future\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:51.000\nAnd they ask you, did you do it or not\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nYou can play your hit podcast\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nAnd have everybody go, yeah\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nMaybe these people\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:58.000\nYou're witnesses\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nYou can do it on a table\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nI can do it on the table\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nDo it on the table\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nDon't do it on the table\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nLay down on the table\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nThat's a bad idea\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nThat table seems like it's not really on the table\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nThat would be perfect\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nDo it on the table\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nJust do it on the table\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nThis is great\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nOh, shit\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nI hate these parts of the podcast\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nBecause it's like I always imagine\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nBeing the person that's here for the first time\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nLike, why did you take me here?\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nWell, because he's a great writer\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nHe's not writing\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nHe's laying his back with his knees up\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nOkay, so this is the exercise\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nLike, I think\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nHe's kind of off, people\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nI go like this\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nOne\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nI think I just go like that, I think\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nI can't remember it\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nNo, no, no\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nI keep my ass on the floor\n\n01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nAnd then the smaller my back\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nIs supposed to be like that\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nAnd you keep reaching for the stars\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nAnd then\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nAnd then I flatten it\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nAnd then I go like that\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nAnd then I flatten it\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nHe's arching his back\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nRight\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nOr\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nI'm just looking right at your crotch\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nI can't see anything\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nSo podcast dynamite, right?\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nRight\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nNo, no, no\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nWe're getting you some exercise\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nYou have plausible deniability now\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nWith your chiropractic\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nIf he said once a week, do it\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nThen I could do it every week here\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nYeah\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nYou could put on a rap beat\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nAnd I could do a chorus\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nYeah\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nYeah\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nDo it to the beat\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nYeah\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nYeah\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nDo it to the beat\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nYeah\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nStrengthen your core\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nYeah\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nYeah\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nStrengthen your core\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nYeah\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nYeah\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nThere's a group of muscles\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nBetween your ass and your back\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nIt's called your core\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nGonna keep your life on track\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000\nIt's gonna make your posture clean\n\n01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nGonna make it

world\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000\nEnthusiastic\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nEverybody put your hands together for Kanye Jesus\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nOh shit\n\n01:02:44.000 -->

Problems\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nComing around of a new character\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nMr. Back Problems\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nI love bad back\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nSo much the rhythm of the bad back\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000\nSo Mr. Back Problems\n\n01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000\nMr. Back Problems\n\n01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nIt's a new character\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nMr. Back Problems\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nMr. Back Problems\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000\nDon't Andy\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nStand

this would be a perfect tag team wrestling match\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000\nThe banger brothers are coming out\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nOh here come the follicle friends\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nHey Derek remember\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nBefore Channel 101 was a thing\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nDan, Rob, Chris, Tom and I would get together\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nLet's make Jaws 4\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nNo one has seen Jaws 4\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nLet's make Jaws 4\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nRob made the most shocking thing in the world\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nIt's kind of the beginning of everything for me\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nExactly\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nRob fucked a lemon\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nPretty hard\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000\nOrange or a lemon\n\n01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000\nIt was an orange but it was a little on the yellow side\n\n01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nIt came off lemon on camera\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nMy dick was Jaws\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nYour dick was Jaws\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nHe made a duct tape fin with a number 4 on it\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nAm I right in saying that Bill Cosby was invoked?\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nNo it was Michael Cain\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000\nBut he talked like Bill Cosby\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nHe sounded like Bill Cosby\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nOh I'm Michael Cain\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nIs that still online?\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nIt's the worst\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nComedy Central put it on their homepage at one point\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nNot realizing that my dick was in it\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nBecause Sarah said\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000\nSarah loved it\n\n01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nSarah saw that video and said\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nI want this guy to direct my pilot\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000\nAnd then somebody said\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nOh it's like on 101\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nAnd then they went\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nOh okay we'll put a link up to that\n\n01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nIt was up there for like a week\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nAnd people were going\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nHoly shit\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nA little warning\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nThere's a dick in it\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nDon't do it and then they pulled it down\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nThere's one line of dialogue and I won't repeat\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nIt's pretty out there\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nYou know what I'm talking about\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nNo\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nI'm not going to say it\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nOkay\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nI will let the audience watch it\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nI don't think it's up there anymore\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nYouTube won't have it?\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nJaws for it must exist\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nI don't think so\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nIt's so good\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000\nI can't believe it's not out there\n\n01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nBut then I think right after that\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nWe all said\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nLet's make\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nEverybody make the next Batman\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nYeah\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nAnd so Dan made a Batman\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nWhich is also\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nIf you haven't seen Dan Harmon with Batman\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nDan's Batman is pretty funny\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nIt's also\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nIt goes all the way\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nAround the bat\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nI remember about that Batman that I made\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nIs my dear girlfriend at the time\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nRobin Roth\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nVery lovely and talented\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nWho was my roommate\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nAnd she volunteered to\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nShe\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nBecause one of the scenes\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nIt was a dark look into Batman's life\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nAnd he was\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nAt one point he's\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000\nHe's\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nHe has\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nIt just cuts to him in bed\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nWith his girlfriend\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nWearing the Batman mask\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nAnd he's saying to his girlfriend\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nWho is naked\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nGet up on your knees\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nI want to kiss you while I jerk off\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nAnd it's just supposed to be\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nCreepy and sad and lonely\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nBecause even when he's with someone\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nHe's alone\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nBut she's\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000\nLike I remember\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nI set up the camera on a tripod\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nAnd like we got into frame\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nAnd like Robin's\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nNipples were\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nOut of frame\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nOn the viewfinder\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nLike these are the early days\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nOf digital video\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nI remember just like the kind of\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nOver scan\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nLike I didn't know all the terminology\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nI remember like when the video\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nWent online it was like\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000\nNo her nipples are well in frame\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nLike it's just\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nJust my topless girlfriend\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nGiving me a hand job\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nAnyway I don't know\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nThe early\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nThose are the days\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nAnd then 9-11 happened\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000\nAnd everyone\n\n01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nEverything changed\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nEven though it's 9-13 now\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000\nSo we missed it\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nAm I\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nNo Jeff\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nWe'll never miss it\n\n01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nYou're right Dan\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nYou know what\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nIt's 9-11 in our hearts\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nIn mine\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000\nI made a Batman\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nAnd I asked Derek\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nTo be my villain in it\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nAnd this character was called\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nPussy Magnet\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nAnd he had a\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nI made him a necklace\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nThat was like a magnet\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nWith the word pussy\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nAnd we showed up at your dojo\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nAnd you're like Jeff\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nLike I can do some karate moves\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nTo kick start my heart\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nI think with Motley Crue\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nAnd you're like\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nI pulled my groin\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nOn a show\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nAnd so I can't really do it\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nIf you can never see this\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nYou're doing giant flying\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nKicks and everything\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nLike you played so hard\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nWhile hurt\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nIt's amazing\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nBut that's part of your thing\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nIt's because I love you\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nHey Derek\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nYeah\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nSo when I met you\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nLike you were\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nI mean like\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nLike you\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nI always say\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nI don't know if it's offensive to you\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nBut because I'm trying to create\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nAn image in people's head\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nLike you looked\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nLike the dude from Powder\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nLike that when I\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nThe first time I ever met you\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nLike because it's amazing\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nWhen you meet somebody\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nWho's all like\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nWho's jacked up\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nAnd looks good\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nIt's like it's hard to imagine\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000\nThat they ever actually bothered\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nTo just like transform themselves\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nWithout permission\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nBut you could have easily\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nJust been a dude\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nIn a trench coat\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nJust hanging out\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nAt a campus behind a tree\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nAnd just like using psychic powers\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nTo you know\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nTo get back at people\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nBut instead you went\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nYou went this route\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nAnd one of my questions\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nIs like\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nCan you remember that point in your life\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nWhen you like\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nWhere you went from\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nJust what God had dealt you\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nTo like\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nDeciding to\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nLike\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nLike just do stuff\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nLike\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nDid you get fit\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nYeah\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nLike what was the threshold\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nWhat pushed you across that threshold\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nWell it was well\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nWhen I grew up in Bakersfield\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nIn California\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nAnd I grew up\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nLike I love\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nWhen it wasn't cool\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nIt was like comic book\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nSci-fi, horror\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nI got into acting\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nBecause the Dungeons and Dragons\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nGoing like\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nOh man\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nI want to do this someday professionally\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000\nHow do I do that\n\n01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nOh an actor? Perfect\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nBut I also grew up as a different kid\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nBecause I had the alopecia\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nAnd so what alopecia is\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nFor people don't know\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nIs when your body rejects your hair\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nJust\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000\nI've had it my entire life\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nWhich is recently\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000\nLike the last four years\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nI could grow a goatee\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000\nFor some reason\n\n01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nYeah I know\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000\nWhich is bizarre\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nI was like liar\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000\nLook at his facial hair\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nNo way\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000\nBull crap\n\n01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nBut it was weird also going to\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000\nYour friends who are an adult male\n\n01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nAnd going like\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000\nHey how do you\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nAt 40 plus\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000\nDo you do this\n\n01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nHas that stopped recently\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nI don't remember the last time\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nNo no still\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000\nI keep shaving it for shows\n\n01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nSometimes I grow up\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nSo all of a sudden there's this goatee\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nOut of nowhere\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nYeah\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000\nOkay\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000\nWe'll talk about that in a second\n\n01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nYeah but no\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000\nI got to the point\n\n01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nI moved to LA to do acting and comedy\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nAnd it's actually\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000\nJeff was the one who turned me on\n\n01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nTo go into this class\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nWith Sam Christensen\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nWhere all of you guys were going to class\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nAnd I joined him with everybody\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000\nDoing the Sam Christensen class\n\n01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nMe and Marco from Die Hard\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000\nYes\n\n01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000\nYes\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nAnd that class\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nI learned about\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nLike Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000\nIt's kind of an amalgamation\n\n01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nOf the two put together\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nAnd I learned about\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nMy essences\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nWhen I give out as a human being\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000\nI went wait a second\n\n01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nIf I worked out\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nI could be like the big bad guy\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nIn TV and film\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nEveryone's like\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nOh you like the jock in school\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nLike you know you can do\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nLike you're the super thick guy\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000\nI go no\n\n01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nI could like\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nI was the kid you know\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nLike getting picked on\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000\nLike maybe do a pull up\n\n01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nOr whatever\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000\nAnd that was about it\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nWait so what did you learn\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nIn Sam's class\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nYou were in Sam's class\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nWhen you were still scrawny\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nYeah\n\n01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nFor lack of a better word\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nWhat were you hearing\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nFrom Sam's class\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nThat made you think\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000\nIf you got jacked up\n\n01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nWhat were you hearing\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nWell Sam's really nice\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000\nBecause he brings me up\n\n01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nTo other students\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000\nWhere he talks about\n\n01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nYou find out\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nWhat your essences are\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nLike when you walk into a room\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nWhat you give off to people\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nIf you're just quiet\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nAnd just like\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000\nWhat they're\n\n01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nWho they are\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000\nLike in the old days\n\n01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nWhat we used to do\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nIs go to like the airport\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000\nAnd like for example\n\n01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nHypothetically we go there\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000\nLike Dan was down in the corner\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nAnd I have a list\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nOf adjectives on a piece of paper\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nAnd I would walk around to strangers\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nAnd go hey my friend\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000\nDan Harmon\n\n01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nWe're in an acting class together\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nThat guy over there\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nYeah yeah\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nCan you mark any adjective\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000\nYou think applies to Dan\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nJust by looking at him\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nWithout him saying anything\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000\nAnd after about a hundred of these\n\n01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nOr so you start seeing\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000\nThe same patterns\n\n01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nLike some of the same words\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nRepeat over and over again\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nI literally did that exercise\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nAnd you think like\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nOh this is horseshit\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nYou take him home and go\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nWhy do\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nIt's an international terminal\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000\nSo a lot of these people\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nAre just like from Poland\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nAnd it's like\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000\nWhy does everyone think I'm sarcastic\n\n01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nEveryone thinks I'm sarcastic\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nYou're standing like 50 feet away\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000\nAnd you're standing there neutral\n\n01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nI check off things that apply\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000\nTo this person and everybody agrees\n\n01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nI got sarcastic, lazy, smart\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nThat's it\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000\nThat's all I remember\n\n01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000\nI'm like how do you know I'm lazy\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nLike I'm sarcastic\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000\nThe thing is like\n\n01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nThey might all be wrong\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000\nAbout whether or not you're lazy\n\n01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nYou might not be lazy\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nBecause you're a workaholic\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nI don't think of you as a lazy person\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nBut strangers all\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000\nRob does\n\n01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nUnanimously agree\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000\nWho?\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nRob\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nMakes a lot of comments about it\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nI went with a guy\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000\nWho looked like Charles Bronson\n\n01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nWho was this tough dude\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000\nWith a mustache\n\n01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nAnd I would go like\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nPeople were like\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000\nThis is back in the days\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nWhere you could walk into the terminal\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nBefore a flight\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nBefore you had to go through security\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nYou could be at the gate\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nWithout going through security\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000\nAnd so you'd say\n\n01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nSee that guy over there\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000\nWe're in an iPhone class\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000\nYour flight is delayed\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000\nIf you got nothing better to do\n\n01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nCheck off what you think\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000\nApplies to this person\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nAnd people love it\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000\nBecause you get to\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nBecause there's not a lot of shit\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nTo do at the airport\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nEspecially this is before 9-11\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nAnd before the massive amount of\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nThis is before Candy Crush\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nThis is before words with friends\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000\nThis is before people had shit to do\n\n01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000\nI get to pass judgment on a stranger\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nWith no contact lenses\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nIt's hilarious\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nAnd I say also\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nIf you want to write things down\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nExtra things at the bottom\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000\nTo that too\n\n01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nAnd the thing is\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000\nThey all said the same shit\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nSo we got 50\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nLike Sam Christensen said\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nLike do five if you trust me\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nDo 500 if you don't\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nLike the thing is\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nIt's going to be the same information\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nNo matter what\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000\nLike everyone's going to agree\n\n01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nThat\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nRemember Schrab\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nRemember the weekend intensive\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nAnd you're not supposed to tell anybody\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000\nWhat's on your cards\n\n01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000\nBecause then you do an intensive version\n\n01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000\nWhere your student\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nYour fellow students\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000\nAre writing shit down\n\n01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nDuring exercises\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000\nSchrab is all sullen\n\n01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nHe's mad\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000\nWe were walking down the sidewalk\n\n01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nOut of the thing\n\n01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nAnd I was like\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000\nMan this is fucking great\n\n01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nBecause I had like\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000\nLooked at my cards\n\n01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nAnd you looked at yours\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000\nAnd you're not supposed to talk to each other\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nAt lunch about your cards\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000\nAnd\n\n01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000\nRob said\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000\nRob's bummed out\n\n01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nAnd I said\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000\nWhat's going on man\n\n01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000\nYou're not having a good time\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000\nHe's like\n\n01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000\nI don't know man\n\n01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000\nAnd I'm like\n\n01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nWhat is it\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000\nIt's like\n\n01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nSomeone said\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000\nI look like C-3PO\n\n01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:29.000\nI'm not C-3PO\n\n01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000\nHe was like\n\n01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nMoving his\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000\nLike\n\n01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nThe best\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nI was like\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000\nAre you doing a bit\n\n01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000\nAre you doing a bit\n\n01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nI wasn't\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000\nNo I'm not\n\n01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nI'm not C-3PO\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000\nI wasn't\n\n01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nI only speak\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000\n5 million languages\n\n01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nI\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000\nBut okay\n\n01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nSo Derek\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000\nSo in that case\n\n01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nHang on\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000\nThe guy I went to the airport with\n\n01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000\nThis kind of tough Charles Bronson looking dude\n\n01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nWe got in the car\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nAnd I got teamed up with him\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000\nI didn't really want to be\n\n01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nThis guy's partner\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nTurned out to be the most informative thing\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000\nIn the world\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nBecause we got in the car\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000\nAnd he's looking through the stuff\n\n01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nAnd he's like\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000\nHe's going through his\n\n01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nEverything's like\n\n01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000\nWhy does everybody say suspicious\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000\nLike\n\n01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nDude\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000\nYou're suspect\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000\nLike\n\n01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nYou're suspicious of them\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000\nI'm suspicious of you\n\n01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000\nAnd also the same guy\n\n01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nActually got up\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000\nAnd he's like\n\n01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000\nWhy do people keep saying\n\n01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nI'm loud\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000\nAnd walked out\n\n01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nAnd watching other people\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000\nReject their shit\n\n01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nWas amazing\n\n01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000\nBut Rob like\n\n01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000\nI know I had one that made me cry\n\n01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nLike I was like\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000\nOh that's fucking exactly\n\n01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nHow you say that thing\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000\nAnd you had one\n\n01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nThat I loved\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000\nIt's\n\n01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000\nLast puppy at the pound\n\n01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nRight\n\n01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nIt's amazing\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nBut also because you want\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nYou root for the last puppy at the pound\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000\nLike he's the cute one\n\n01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nYeah\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000\nAnd the last puppy at the pound\n\n01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nManipulates people\n\n01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000\nWhat was your breakthrough on Dan?\n\n01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000\nMine was a mud monster on shore leave\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nWhich I personally find\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000\nBecause it's like\n\n01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nI'm a mud\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nI'm from the fucking shitty slimy world\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000\nBut I'm on vacation\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000\nI like\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nI like clean soft frilly\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nLike I like the real world\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000\nI love it\n\n01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nI just don't belong in it\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nSo I'm just like\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nThat's fucking awesome\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nYou're so clean\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nYou know that's why I love Hugh Jackman\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000\nThat's why I was like\n\n01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nWhen we worked with him\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000\nI'm like I fucking love that guy\n\n01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nThat's why I love\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000\nI love fucking handsome pretty things\n\n01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000\nI love clean\n\n01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000\nBut I'm never gonna be\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nI'm on shore leave\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nBut I don't want to hang out\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nIt's like when a LA person\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000\nGoes to Portland\n\n01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000\nAnd they keep apologizing\n\n01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nFor it being overcast\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000\nI was like\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nMotherfucker, why do you think I came here?\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nI live in a desert\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000\nThat's me with mud\n\n01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000\nLike I'm a mud monster\n\n01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nOn shore leave\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000\nWhat was yours, Jarrett?\n\n01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nMy main one?\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nYeah\n\n01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nMy main one was I've been many places\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nBut I've never forgotten where I've come from\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nSo you started lifting weights?\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000\nYeah\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000\nWhat was it?\n\n01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000\nI had like a lot of like\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000\nWhat was it?\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nI have this gentle tough guy thing\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000\nWorking like a Swiss watch\n\n01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nAnd I had another one\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000\nWhere it was like a superhero\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000\nAnd search a superhero\n\n01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nWhen for meaningful exchange of superpowers\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000\nAnd so there's a lot of comic booky type things\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nAnd I'm like, wait, if I worked out\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000\nI could be the same bad guy\n\n01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nYou're getting these things\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nYou felt like you were like a dexter in Space Ace\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000\nBut you weren't Space Ace yet\n\n01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000\nNo, my god, that's a reference\n\n01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nApplies never\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nYeah, absolutely\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nYeah, yeah, absolutely\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nThat's amazing\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nDon Bluth laser disc game\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nA Space Ace reference\n\n01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nWhen did I become the guy that's like\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000\nI made a reference\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000\nWhen I just cast on this ice floe\n\n01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000\nCould we apply Sam Christensen's knowledge\n\n01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000\nOn Spencer and give him an essence?\n\n01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nOoh, that's a good one\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nSpencer's essence is\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nI am taking over your ship\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nAnd sailing it into\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nCock Harbor\n\n01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000\nI am a Viking of Pussy\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nNo, I don't\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nIt's a fun place\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nLet's see, Spencer's essence is\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000\nThis is weird, right?\n\n01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nThat's one of them?\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nThe thing about this class\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nIt's amazing, Drew Carey\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nI took it a long time ago\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nAnd I told Drew about it\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nAnd Drew's famous\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nAnd we were taking a road trip together\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nAnd he's like, I want to know who I am\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nThe whole point is that\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nThere's things that people, strangers, friends\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nInstantly agree about you\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000\nWhether they're right or wrong\n\n01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nThey all go like\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nIf you look at you and go like\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000\nDo you like to swim\n\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000\nOr do you hate getting your hair wet?\n\n01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000\nThey would all agree or disagree on that\n\n01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000\nBut it would be unanimous\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000\nYou might be an Olympic swimmer\n\n01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nBut they might go no\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000\nShe doesn't like to get her hair wet\n\n01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nBecause this is an essence about you\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000\nI'm just making off the top of my head\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nIt's this thing like\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nYou find out all the things you wish\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000\nPeople thought about you\n\n01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nMaybe they don't\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nAlso some things that you wish\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000\nLike, I hope people think of this\n\n01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nThey do think that\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nThe big thing is\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nThat everything that sticks out about you\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nWhen you're six years old\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nIs the same forever\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000\nEveryone notices everything that's special about you\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nIt doesn't have to be who you are\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000\nIt's the way you stick out\n\n01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000\nIt's the edges that you have\n\n01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000\nIt doesn't have to be a glamorous\n\n01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nIt's not always like\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nWe're raised on myths like the ugly duckling\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nAnd Rudolph and things where\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nWe get that concept that\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000\nOh, maybe the thing that you think is ugly\n\n01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000\nWill make you beautiful\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000\nBut that still enforces the idea\n\n01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nOf utility and beauty\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nThe more important thing to realize\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000\nIs that when you're on the playground\n\n01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nYou're differently shaped\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000\nThan everyone around you\n\n01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nAnd your early experiences\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000\nWith what makes you different\n\n01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000\nAre usually negative experiences\n\n01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000\nBecause the people around you\n\n01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nThey're the things that stick out\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nThey're practicing being a society\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nWhich is like water\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000\nWhich erodes away at rough edges\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nSo all of our early experiences\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nHearing things about ourselves\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nAre experiences of crowds gathering\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nAround us and going\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nNanny nanny panty panty\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000\nI'm not a panty panty\n\n01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000\nAnd it only means something to us\n\n01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nIt's something that they figured out\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nThey fucking zeroed in on it\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nAnd it might even just be\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nThe fact that you hate attention\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nThat's for a lot of people\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nAnd then they fucking hone in\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nAnd a lot of us who are destined\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nFor interesting things\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nOr just hard things\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nThat's when we have to practice\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nBeing special, whether we like it or not\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nAnd they get to practice being a society\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000\nWhether they like it or not\n\n01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000\nWhat was amazing in the class\n\n01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000\nThere was women in my class\n\n01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nLike young or middle-aged women\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000\nThat they have to find out\n\n01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000\nHow the world thinks of them as pretty\n\n01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nOr beautiful\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000\nAnd there was a couple of girls\n\n01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000\nThat were really beautiful\n\n01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000\nAnd the way that the world thinks\n\n01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000\nLike the way they describe their beauty\n\n01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nIs really hard for them to hear\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nBecause they've been tortured by that\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nSince they were little girls\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nAnd so for them to own the fact\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nThat there was...\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000\nI won't say her name\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nBecause she's on TV and you all know her\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000\nShe's one Emmys and shit\n\n01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000\nShe was in the class\n\n01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nShe's a Latina\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000\nAmy Esperanza\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nYes, it was Amy Esperanza\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000\nPeople in the class\n\n01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000\nSecretly write down ways\n\n01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nTo describe things about people\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000\nAnd they kept saying hot tamale\n\n01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nShe's like, I'm not a hot tamale\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000\nBut it's like Sam's like\n\n01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000\nYou're a hot tamale\n\n01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000\nWhat do you like or not?\n\n01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000\nThey're racist but...\n\n01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000\nI've heard that since I was a little girl\n\n01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000\nYou're going to hear that till you die\n\n01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000\nCatherine Hepburn when she was...\n\n01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000\nHow old was she when Philadelphia Story came out?\n\n01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000\n18, 19, very young\n\n01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000\nAll the reviews called her feisty\n\n01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000\nEveryone said she's feisty\n\n01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nShe's feisty\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nThen when she's whatever, 70\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nOr whatever she was on Golden Pond\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nCrusty\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nWhen you're older\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nThey call you crusty\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nShe was in essence of defiance\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000\nWhen you're a defiant 18-year-old woman\n\n01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nYou're feisty\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nWhen you're defiant 70-year-old woman\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000\nYou're crusty\n\n01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000\nFlavor becomes like\n\n01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000\nHey, who poisoned my food?\n\n01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000\nBut what they're talking about is\n\n01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000\nCatherine Hepburn's essence is\n\n01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000\nShe never needed men\n\n01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nIt was a complete defiance of masculinity\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nWe have different names for that\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nWhen you're young and when you're old\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nOne of the things he had us do\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000\nHe said, go home, grab your yearbooks\n\n01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nI don't even know if you kids do the yearbook thing anymore\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nThat was the last time anyone was going to say shit to you\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nThey would write all this shit in your yearbook\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nAlso, all your love letters\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nWe would pass loose leaf love letters\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nI would keep them all\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000\nOur generation, we'd have boxes of them\n\n01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nHe said, go home, grab the notes\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000\nFrom the girls in your high school\n\n01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nWhen they started, when things were going good\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nWhen they liked you\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nAnd then go all the way through\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nWhen they have a problem with you\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nAnd look at the fact that\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nThere's just two different words\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nFor what makes you who you are\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nAnd when they're hot for you\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000\nYou're capricious\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nAnd when they are dumping you\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nYour fucking scatterbrains\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nFor me, all my yearbook stuff\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nThere's different neighborhoods of things\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nThere's a way to describe how you're attractive\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nOr how you're funny\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nOr how you're smart\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000\nOr how you're lonely\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nOr how you're weird\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000\nOr how you're fucked up\n\n01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nWe have these neighborhoods of these\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000\nDifferent qualities of ourselves\n\n01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nOne of mine is, if you like me\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nConfident, poised\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nIf you don't like me\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nCocky, arrogant\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nLike a piece of shit\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nThis piece of shit just thrown in\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nThat's like the cheese on the cheese fries\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000\nPiece of shit could go on anything\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nFor me, the one that blew my mind\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000\nSam's like, alright, of course\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nThe one that blew my mind\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nWe're trying to figure out\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nSam's like, there's a way to describe the fact\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nIt's not enough to say, Jeff, that you're cocky\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nBecause you are cocky\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nBut also, you're not just arrogant\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nAlso, you're not just poised\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000\nYou're not just self-confident\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nThere's a way to describe it\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000\nYou also have a huge cock\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nThank you\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000\nHe asked me about that\n\n01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nFor coming to this class\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000\nSo anyway, I'm fucking Sam Prestige\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000\nI'm gonna write you a check right now\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000\nFor taking this class\n\n01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nBut so he has these books of slang\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nAnd you go to the OED and all this stuff\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000\nYou're trying to find the perfect way to word things\n\n01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000\nAnd he wrote it down and he goes, Jeff, he goes\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nI think you're gonna like this\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nI don't think anybody else in the world would\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nI think that you might actually agree with this\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nAnd like this description of that neighborhood of stuff\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nAnd it was, he wrote it down in a piece of paper\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nAnd gave it to me\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nAnd I like hit this desk and started crying\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nI was like, exactly\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nAnd it was not conceded, just convinced\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000\nI said, yeah, I don't think I'm better than you\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nI know I am\n\n01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nOnly a dick would think it was better than you\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000\nI just am\n\n01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000\nLet's move on\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nI could be a great guy\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000\nYou can laugh at me like, oh, yeah\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nI'm a prick, but there's a charm to that prickiness\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nAnd there's a thing\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000\nNo, we always circle that\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nBecause it's like there's some people that turn you off\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000\nWith their confidence\n\n01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000\nBecause it's like, oh, that dick\n\n01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000\nAnd then it's like some people rise\n\n01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nThey go, somebody strata up that they're like\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nOh, yeah, I got nothing to worry about\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nSo let me take you out on the dance floor\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nI give you a twirl\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nLike, oh, yeah, I'm not battling those dragons\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nSo let me share my wealth with you\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nThere was a girl in my class who is a great actor, Silas\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nAnd she's amazing\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000\nAnd also, again, you would know who she was\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nShe's the one that turned me on to the class\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000\nGina Davis\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nHuh?\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nGina Davis\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000\nJudy Dench\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000\nAnd there was one essence that she could never agree on\n\n01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000\nAnd we all in the class knew exactly what it was\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nAnd it was impossible\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nAnd she would never figure out the last one\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000\nAnd we'd all just say to her, you're impossible\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nYou're impossible\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nAnd that doesn't mean bad\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nLike, impossible is amazing\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000\nBecause like, there's no pleasing you\n\n01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nBut also like, you're the most important person to try to please\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nLike, you're just beyond pleasing\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000\nOh, she ended up marrying Tom Cruise\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nJudy Dench\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nThere was a girl in the class\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nAnd she stormed out and she goes, hard to handle\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000\nShe was German, she's hard to handle, fuck this class\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000\nI'm not C-3PO\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000\nAlso, Rob, you have a good one that I love\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nIt's Little Green Man\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nLittle Green Man, yeah\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nI love that one\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nLittle Green Man\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nBecause you are from outer space\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nAnd in an awesome way\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nAnd that's the C-3PO essence too\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nI guess\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000\nYeah, it's not Boba Fett\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nJen, one of your essences that I love is\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nUnspeakable Sadness\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nRight?\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nIt's unspeakable\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nThat's why I text you\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nTry to help you through that sadness\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nWithout speaking\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nNo, no, no, it's uncomfortable\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nSo I text you\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000\nAnd you know, even though you don't text back, I hear you\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000\nIt's okay\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nI remember one of the cards from that class\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nThat somebody wrote that led to that\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nBeing one of my essences\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nWhich is what you get from this class\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nAnd this really, really like\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nIt triggered me\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nIt's weird when you hear the shit that's like\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nLike I, you know, in the class\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000\nYou do monologue, like Sam goes\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nTell us about an animal that changed your life\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000\nOh boy\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000\nAnd you'll talk for three minutes\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nAnd the other student scribble\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nHe gives the students an exercise\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nIt goes, I want you to compare Dan to\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000\nA weather phenomenon on your card\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nHe just like gives you specific instructions\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nTo get you out of your head\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nBut like, and sometimes he goes like\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nFree anything, like no category\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000\nDan, talk about a celebrity you hate\n\n01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nOr whatever\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000\nTalk for a while\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nAnd then I got my cards\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nAnd one of them just said\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nTalk, talk, talk, wounded\n\n01:28:51.000 -->

it\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nAnd somebody wrote\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nAnd I love this one\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nAnd she goes\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nThat white boy crazy\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000\nAlright\n\n01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000\nI was just standing there\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nAlright\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000\nWell,

Drew Carey\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000\nSo we were in the car\n\n01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nAnd he's like\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000\nI want to know who I am\n\n01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nAnd he went and took the class\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nAnd he was\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nHe was still\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nLike the Drew Carey show was still happening\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000\nThat was crazy\n\n01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nSomeone wrote\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nThe Price is Right\n\n01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000\nHe hadn't\n\n01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nWhen he\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nThat was his essence\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000\nI saw Drew\n\n01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nAnd then he went to the show\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000\nAnd he was like\n\n01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nI want to go see\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nI want to go see a Greg Phrupp's comedy show\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nAnd Drew is there\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nAnd he goes\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nThank you\n\n01:30:14.000 -->

sure\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000\nHe was doing it a bit\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nBut he wasn't\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nI saw Drew at a gig\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000\nAnd he goes\n\n01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nHey man, so\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000\nIt's got called\n\n01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nMy Les Moonves\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000\nFrom CBS\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nAnd they're offering me\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000\nTo be in\n\n01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000\nLike the new host of Price is Right\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nI'm like\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nAre you going to do it?\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000\nAnd he goes\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nI guess if the money's good enough\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nI was like\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000\nNo, if the price is right\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nIt's like\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nIf the money's good enough\n\n01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000\nIf they mean my quote\n\n01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nCome on forward\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nThat was your one chance\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000\nThat was your one chance\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000\nIf the money's good enough\n\n01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nI'm like\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nI looked at him like\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000\nAre you fucking with me right now?\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000\nSo Drew went and took the class\n\n01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000\nAnd he then sent everybody he knew\n\n01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000\nLike all the people in the Drew Carey set\n\n01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nHe paid for people to go\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nTo take Sam Christensen's class\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000\nYou must do it\n\n01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nEven if you're not an actor\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000\nIt's really great\n\n01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nLike soft knowledge stuff\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000\nIt really does liberate you\n\n01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nIn terms of like\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nAgreeing with the fact\n\n01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nThat the world knows who you are\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nWhether you like it or not\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nAnd also\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nThere's some stuff that you think you are\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nThat you're just fucking not\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nAnd like\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000\nThat you learned\n\n01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nAnd there's a lot of stuff\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000\nThat people are always going to think you are\n\n01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000\nAnd fucking get over it\n\n01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nLike people think that I don't like them\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nAnd like now\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000\nAt this stage\n\n01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nThey're right\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000\nBut\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nI told Sam\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nWe had had back in the old days\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000\nLike you would talk to Sam\n\n01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nAnd he's like Jeff\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000\nHe's like\n\n01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nYou're a really loyal guy\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000\nLike you're loyal to your friends\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nLike you will stick with your friends\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nNo matter what\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000\nYou're a loyal person\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nHe goes\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nBut that's not one of your essences\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nYou don't walk in a room\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nAnd go\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nOh this dude's true blue\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000\nLike he will always stick with me\n\n01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nYou don't walk in the room\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000\nLooking like that\n\n01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nThat's something that\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000\nYou know after meeting you\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nBut that's not\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nThat's not an essence of yours\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nSo get over that one\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000\nSo Drew went\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000\nAnd what I love about Drew\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nOne of his was\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nAnd one that really set Drew\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nCarry free\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nWhich is amazing\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nAnd he was so happy to learn this\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nOne of his essences is\n\n01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nI'm doing the best I can\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000\nWith what I've got\n\n01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nAnd he's like\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000\nAnd I'm a millionaire\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000\nHe goes\n\n01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nBut I'm just still trying\n\n01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000\nThe best I can\n\n01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000\nThat's exactly who he is\n\n01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nYou could say that\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000\nThat's a phrase you can say\n\n01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000\nWhen you want to do an impression\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000\nOf Drew Carry\n\n01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000\nI'm doing the best I can with what I've got\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000\nAm I allowed to know that\n\n01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nAbout myself?\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000\nIt's like\n\n01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nLook at what I have\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nLike I can't say that\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nHe's like\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000\nNo it doesn't matter what you think\n\n01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nIt's exactly what everybody does\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000\nOh sorry\n\n01:33:08.000

01:33:14.000\nTalk talk talk wounded\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000\nSo Derek\n\n01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000\nYou're a muscle man\n\n01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nAre you going to hit me like my dad?\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nDad\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nWhen you're physically fit\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nLike all I've ever known is\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000\nI look in the mirror and I go\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nAlright\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000\nThat's a sea otter\n\n01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nThat's a baby\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000\nLike\n\n01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nAnd that's how I came out of the womb\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nAnd I've never done any exercise\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nAnd I'm like\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nStill look like a baby\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000\nAnd then like\n\n01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000\nIf I start to look like a fat baby\n\n01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nThen I'm like\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000\nI kind of figure something out\n\n01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nAnd then I'm like\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000\nOkay I look like a baby again\n\n01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000\nBut then other people are like\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000\nAnd then they look like\n\n01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nLike\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000\nG.I.

look like\n\n01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000\nSenator Cartgage\n\n01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000\nFrom Homestyle Runner\n\n01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000\nLook good\n\n01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000\nTall and skinny with a giant belly\n\n01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000\nI'm like\n\n01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000\nThis is fucking\n\n01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000\nLike I have to curb that shit\n\n01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000\nHere's your secret\n\n01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000\nBut you won't do this\n\n01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000\nBecause you're not vain like I am\n\n01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000\nBuy suits that you love\n\n01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000\nAnd if you can't fit in them\n\n01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000\nStop it\n\n01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000\nStop doing what you're doing\n\n01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000\nGet back in the suits\n\n01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000\nDon't let them out\n\n01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000\nLike fucking\n\n01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000\nLike I buy suits that I fit into\n\n01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000\nAnd if I can't fit in them\n\n01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000\nThen exercise and diet\n\n01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000\nGet it back on track\n\n01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000\nThat's visualizing your goals\n\n01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000\nAnd where you want to be\n\n01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000\nIt's precisely\n\n01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000\nMakes it concrete\n\n01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000\nAnd more attainable that way\n\n01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000\nAlso, as you get older\n\n01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000\nI got to say it\n\n01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000\nSounds dumb\n\n01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000\nYoga\n\n01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000\nOh, absolutely\n\n01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000\nAbsolutely\n\n01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000\nBecause you need flexibility\n\n01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000\nAnd agility\n\n01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000\nAnd your joints\n\n01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000\nAnd stuff like that\n\n01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000\nLike when you do that stuff\n\n01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000\nYou can spring up and down\n\n01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000\nStaircases like a gazelle\n\n01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000\nBut otherwise\n\n01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000\nYour joints are creaking\n\n01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000\nLike an old\n\n01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000\nIt's like a ratchet trap\n\n01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000\nIf you're your whole life\n\n01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000\nYou're walking\n\n01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000\nYou're not even working out\n\n01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000\nAnd just doing normal activity\n\n01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000\nEverything is cranked and cranked\n\n01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000\nEvery time you engage that muscle\n\n01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000\nAnd if you don't undo that\n\n01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000\nYou start getting that\n\n01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000\nBe that old person hunch\n\n01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000\nAnd whatnot\n\n01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000\nIt's not good for the body\n\n01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000\nIt hurts\n\n01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000\nDamn it\n\n01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000\nOh, man\n\n01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000\nBut this is opening my eyes to something\n\n01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000\nWhat's with yoga pants?\n\n01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000\nBecause the\n\n01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000\nThat seems like a recent thing\n\n01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000\nAnd it's like\n\n01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000\nI question it\n\n01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000\nNo, I don't\n\n01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000\nI think I support yoga pants\n\n01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000\nIn every possible way\n\n01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000\nWhen did that come about?\n\n01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000\nThat seems to be\n\n01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000\nLike\n\n01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000\nBecause I keep hearing conflicting reports\n\n01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000\nI think I think\n\n01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000\nYou knew lemon came along\n\n01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000\nAnd made everybody wear yoga pants\n\n01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000\nI guess I just\n\n01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000\nYeah, I asked my girlfriends\n\n01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000\nThat's what it is\n\n01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000\nIt's like money flooded into\n\n01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000\nAn area of fashion slash exercise\n\n01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000\nAnd so this new form of pants\n\n01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000\nWas developed\n\n01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000\nBecause I never had to\n\n01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000\nI'm like, wait a minute\n\n01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.000\nWhat?\n\n01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000\nThere's pants that\n\n01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000\nThey\n\n01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000\nLike yoga pants\n\n01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000\nThey\n\n01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.000\nStretch\n\n01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000\nThey\n\n01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000\nThey look like stockings\n\n01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.000\nWell, no, they\n\n01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000\nThey also\n\n01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000\nThey make your ass look good\n\n01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000\nRight?\n\n01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000\nYeah\n\n01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000\nBut they're also comfortable\n\n01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000\nSo previously\n\n01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000\nThere was a dichotomy of things\n\n01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000\nThat made you look good\n\n01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000\nVersus things that were comfortable\n\n01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000\nBut this is the thing that's comfortable\n\n01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000\nThat makes your ass look good\n\n01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000\nIt's like a perfect storm\n\n01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000\nLike\n\n01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000\nWhy didn't they\n\n01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000\nWhat technology did they\n\n01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000\nWhat did they find out in space\n\n01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000\nThat led them to Houston\n\n01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000\nWe found a stitch that\n\n01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000\nI don't know\n\n01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000\nHave you tried stretch jeans yet\n\n01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000\nFor men?\n\n01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000\nNo, I'm not making a joke\n\n01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000\nI swear to God\n\n01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000\nI shot this thing in Europe\n\n01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000\nAnd I tried these pants\n\n01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.000\nAnd I went, oh my god\n\n01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000\nWait, these are stretch\n\n01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000\nThey're like yoga pants\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000\nBut I'm wearing some right now\n\n01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000\nLike checkings?\n\n01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000\nNo, these stretch\n\n01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.000\nThey're like, they're new\n\n01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000\nLike Levi's\n\n01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000\nBut they're super flexible\n\n01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000\nThat's why I'm not\n\n01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000\nKilling my balls trying to\n\n01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000\nGet in the ceiling\n\n01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000\nI was like\n\n01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000\nBecause those look like regular jeans\n\n01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000\nThey're not\n\n01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000\nThey're flexed\n\n01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000\nThey're like four-way flex\n\n01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000\nAll right, well\n\n01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000\nSuper comfy\n\n01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.000\nWell, I don't know what else\n\n01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000\nWe could possibly cover\n\n01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000\nLet's do a Q&A\n\n01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000\nWho's got a question\n\n01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000\nFor either a life long\n\n01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000\nCinematic stuntman\n\n01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000\nSlash monster\n\n01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000\nSlash\n\n01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000\nActor\n\n01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000\nGoon actor\n\n01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000\nIn the background\n\n01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000\nSlash\n\n01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000\nGoon actor\n\n01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000\nGoon actor\n\n01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.000\nYeah, I'm with you Jeff\n\n01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000\nWell, what?\n\n01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000\nOkay, it's like, all right\n\n01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000\nI have a question\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000\nDave\n\n01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000\nDave Kline has a question\n\n01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000\nI believe in the guy Goon\n\n01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000\nPrince theory of masculine identity\n\n01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000\nAnd when you said Goon\n\n01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000\nI think that everyone has a guy\n\n01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000\nWho's like kind of a tough guy\n\n01:46:38.000 -->

royalty\n\n01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000\nAnd you got all those pieces in you\n\n01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000\nHe said you got a little bit of Goon\n\n01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000\nWhat's your guy part\n\n01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000\nAnd what's your prince part?\n\n01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:58.000\nAll right, my guy part\n\n01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000\nThe macho side of background\n\n01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000\nAnd not professionally, but fighting\n\n01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000\nMMA and what not\n\n01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000\nAnd training martial arts for a long time\n\n01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000\nMy prince part is\n\n01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000\nI try to be, that philosophy\n\n01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000\nTo be good to everybody\n\n01:47:12.000

fans\n\n01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000\nHere and there\n\n01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000\nAnd what I love to do\n\n01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000\nIt bumps me out on the social media\n\n01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000\nI'll see, so often people aren't happy\n\n01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000\nWith how they look\n\n01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000\nOr how they feel about themselves\n\n01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000\nAnd I try to empower people\n\n01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000\nGoing like, man, like\n\n01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000\nI grew, I was a different kid, man\n\n01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000\nI had no hair\n\n01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000\nI was either, people thought I either had cancer\n\n01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nOr I was a skinhead\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000\nYou know, growing up when it wasn't cool\n\n01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000\nTo be bald and white\n\n01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000\nPeople were like, oh, that guy's totally white\n\n01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000\nPowered like, no, swear to God\n\n01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000\nI'm not\n\n01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000\nBut growing up being different\n\n01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000\nAnd kind of being like a monster out there\n\n01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000\nIt's coming back though\n\n01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000\nIt's coming back\n\n01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000\nJust randomly, oh yeah\n\n01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000\nWe haven't talked about that yet\n\n01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000\nBut coming back, I mean\n\n01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000\nBeing an adult now\n\n01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000\nAnd I've got the point I was trying to make\n\n01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000\nThe point was I just\n\n01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000\nTrying to empower people to go\n\n01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000\nWhatever it is that makes you different\n\n01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.000\nStep on that gas pedal\n\n01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000\nLike, no one is like you\n\n01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000\nAnd love yourself for who you are\n\n01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000\nAnd so I love meeting some of these other guys\n\n01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000\nWho are like, they see some of my roles\n\n01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000\nAs being like super tough\n\n01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000\nOh, man, I can't wait\n\n01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000\nI've been so much fun\n\n01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000\nI like to go to bar fights\n\n01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000\nAnd smash people in the face\n\n01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000\nAnd be like, man, right now\n\n01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000\nYou're wearing a mask of insecurity\n\n01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000\nBecause you're trying to be macho\n\n01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000\nThere's no reason for that\n\n01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000\nWe're all human beings\n\n01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000\nExpress how you feel and move on\n\n01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:30.000\nI meant goon like\n\n01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000\nBecause there's a villain\n\n01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000\nThere's goons behind them\n\n01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000\nSo either a monster\n\n01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000\nOr a guy flying out a window on fire\n\n01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000\nOr a goon behind somebody\n\n01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000\nHe hasn't played Othello yet\n\n01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000\nA question?\n\n01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000\nIt could be a Spencer question\n\n01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000\nIt could be a Rob question\n\n01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000\nIt doesn't have to be a Spencer question\n\n01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000\nWhat happened to you?\n\n01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000\nWhat did you do?\n\n01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000\nWhat did you go through?\n\n01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000\nWhat?\n\n01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000\nDid you just take a huge shit?\n\n01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000\nThat couldn't have been a pee\n\n01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000\nNo, I didn't go to the bathroom\n\n01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.000\nAnd answer some emails\n\n01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000\nHe sent some emails\n\n01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.000\nAnswers some emails\n\n01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000\nNo, he answered some emails\n\n01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000\nYou're in a show\n\n01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000\nAll right\n\n01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000\nThis is probably what counts for me\n\n01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000\nQ&A\n\n01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000\nAll right, sir\n\n01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000\nI've got a question for Derek\n\n01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000\nDerek\n\n01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000\nI know that you've been talking about sense of self\n\n01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000\nAnd your essence\n\n01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000\nAnd you've been playing like the bad guy\n\n01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000\nBut do you ever like have the\n\n01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000\nNot ego part of you\n\n01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000\nBut just you really want that\n\n01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000\nReading rule kind of deal\n\n01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000\nWhere you're not Jason\n\n01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000\nWhere you're all mad\n\n01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000\nYeah\n\n01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.000\nBut you're still yourself\n\n01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.000\nI should repeat that\n\n01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000\nAnd then the next time\n\n01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000\nI'll do\n\n01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000\nHe said\n\n01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000\nDo you ever crave playing the lead role?\n\n01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000\nThere you go\n\n01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000\nI probably missed some of the nuance\n\n01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000\nNo, I've been lucky\n\n01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000\nI've done like 85 different\n\n01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000\nLike film and TV projects\n\n01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000\nBut my mentality is\n\n01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000\nLike bouncing back is a bit\n\n01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000\nTo my normal face\n\n01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000\nAnd doing monsters\n\n01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000\nPeople sometimes\n\n01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000\nA tangent of your question\n\n01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000\nAre you like\n\n01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000\nDoes that bother you\n\n01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000\nBecause some of you are like\n\n01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000\nWhen you play like Predator\n\n01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000\nOr what not\n\n01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000\nThat you look\n\n01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000\nWe can't tell that it's you\n\n01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000\nOh shit, he was classic Predator\n\n01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000\nIn the Predators\n\n01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.000\nHe wasn't one of those bullshit Predators\n\n01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000\nAnd he was like\n\n01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000\nOld school Predator\n\n01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000\nHe was like\n\n01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000\nHey little boy\n\n01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000\nWant some candy\n\n01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000\nWant some candy\n\n01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.000\nWant some candy\n\n01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000\nBut to answer your question\n\n01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.000\nAs an artist\n\n01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000\nAny other artist\n\n01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000\nYou want to always outdo yourself\n\n01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000\nAnd do better and better\n\n01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000\nAnd when I get to ask that question\n\n01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000\nWhen it bothers you\n\n01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000\nWhen your face is covered\n\n01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000\nFor some of your bigger roles\n\n01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000\nI'm not bothered by that all\n\n01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.000\nBecause my job is to tell\n\n01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000\nStory and to service that story\n\n01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000\nAnd don't remember me\n\n01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000\nRemember the characters\n\n01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000\nWhen you watch\n\n01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000\nWhen you watch that\n\n01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000\nSorry\n\n01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000\nThanks Dave\n\n01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000\nWhen you watch Hansel and Gretel\n\n01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000\nWhich by the way\n\n01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000\nLike B plus\n\n01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000\nThat Hansel and Gretel movie\n\n01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000\nLike have you seen it\n\n01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000\nIt's a real Goon movie\n\n01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000\nThat's going to bounce off of me\n\n01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000\nBecause I'm picked on too\n\n01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:05.000\nBut when you watch that movie\n\n01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000\nAre you like\n\n01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000\nDo you have PTSD\n\n01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000\nOr do you\n\n01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000\nFunny that you bring this up\n\n01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:17.000\nBecause a fan just sent me a thing\n\n01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000\nBecause AMC just played it\n\n01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.000\nFor the first time\n\n01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000\nAnd they showed like\n\n01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000\nSome of the interviews\n\n01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000\nLike behind the scenes\n\n01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000\nAnd they had a whole segment\n\n01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000\nOf me talking about\n\n01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000\nThe Edward character\n\n01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000\nAnd I literally\n\n01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000\nI'm watching it\n\n01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.000\nBecause of my arm\n\n01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000\nLike I said\n\n01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000\nBetween my five and six\n\n01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000\nI had a herniated disc\n\n01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000\nAnd my whole arm atrophied\n\n01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000\nAnd it took about a year\n\n01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000\nTo heal\n\n01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000\nAnd I'm going to like\n\n01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000\nThese German doctors\n\n01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000\nAnd they're giving me\n\n01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000\nMultiple spinal injections\n\n01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000\nThroughout the week\n\n01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000\nYou're shooting overseas\n\n01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000\nAnd you're like\n\n01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000\nOh my god my fucking body is\n\n01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000\nI can't move\n\n01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000\nAnd then you're at the mercy\n\n01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000\nOf what might be\n\n01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000\nThe better medicine\n\n01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000\nOr worse medicine\n\n01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000\nYou don't know\n\n01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000\nIt's weird\n\n01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000\nAlso the doctor's name\n\n01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000\nTranslated to like\n\n01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000\nDoctor Creepy\n\n01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000\nOr Doctor Sneaky\n\n01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.000\nAnd I was in tears\n\n01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000\nGoing like\n\n01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000\nAre you kidding me\n\n01:51:58.000 -->

is\n\n01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000\nLike Doctor Frankenstein Land\n\n01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000\nEverybody's talking in German\n\n01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.000\nSo you know\n\n01:52:05.000 -->

character\n\n01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000\nThat CG\n\n01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.000\nWhich is the\n\n01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000\nMust be the worst part\n\n01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000\nIs that it's like\n\n01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000\nThat means that it could have been\n\n01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.000\nWell the\n\n01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000\nAre there moments\n\n01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.000\nWhen the\n\n01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000\nThe character is like emoting\n\n01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000\nAnd like doing a thing\n\n01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000\nAnd you're like\n\n01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000\nThat was 50 takes\n\n01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000\nYeah absolutely\n\n01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000\nIt's tough\n\n01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000\nCause also as an actor\n\n01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000\nYou have like\n\n01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000\nYou know what you want to do\n\n01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000\nFor the scene\n\n01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000\nYou've made the characters\n\n01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000\nAnd spectral motion\n\n01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000\nWho made this incredible\n\n01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000\nPiece of machinery\n\n01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000\nI feel like a jet fighter\n\n01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000\nPilot\n\n01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000\nWhere I get to where\n\n01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.000\nI fly this amazing thing\n\n01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000\nYou have to pre-think\n\n01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000\nWhat's going on\n\n01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000\nThis is my arc in the scene\n\n01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000\nHere's the emotion\n\n01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000\nThat's what's happening\n\n01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000\nAnd you have to map out\n\n01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000\nCause I couldn't control\n\n01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000\nMy hands\n\n01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000\nAnd I couldn't control\n\n01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000\nMy mouth\n\n01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000\nCause you saw the mouth\n\n01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000\nBut you can't walk around\n\n01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000\nWith the character\n\n01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000\nThe mouth open the whole time\n\n01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000\nSo they close it\n\n01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000\nAnd so as you're\n\n01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000\nJust sitting there\n\n01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.000\nAnd cooking\n\n01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000\nYou're breathing your own\n\n01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000\nCarbon dioxide\n\n01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000\nSo you're not getting\n\n01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000\nFresh air\n\n01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000\nTo fuel your muscles\n\n01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000\nAnd your brain\n\n01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000\nAnd there are times\n\n01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000\nWhere I'm just like\n\n01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000\nPast\n\n01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000\nYeah yeah\n\n01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000\nThe half

need some water\n\n01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000\nOr something\n\n01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.000\nRight now it's cool\n\n01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000\nAlright\n\n01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000\nAnd
