00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Music

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Hollywood, California

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Again, here's some music by Jordy White

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Music

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Pretty groovy

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
Harmontown is now in session

00:30.000 --> 00:42.000
Spencer Crankton, everybody, Spencer

00:42.000 --> 00:58.000
Thank you

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
We've had a string of some pretty action-packed episodes

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
We've had a lot of crazy guests

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
We've had too much show for too many shows

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
So let's slow it down tonight

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Let's just relax and have a bad show

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Because we're all tired

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
And there's nobody coming

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
And I don't have anything to talk about

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I came here directly from the Great Minds set

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
As did you, Spencer?

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Yes, yes, we did

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Today we shot with Gillian Jacobs from Community

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
She played Ada Lovelace, the mother of programming

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Ada Lovelace, or is it Lovelace?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Ada Lovelace

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
No, Ada Lovelace

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Do the British pronounce Lovelace Lovelace?

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
I think they pronounce a lot of things a lot of ways

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
All I know is she's the mother of modern computing

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
She wrote the very first lines of code

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah, the first algorithm

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
There were no computers yet, she wrote an algorithm

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
You go, girl!

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
That's all I got

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
I still, you know, some classic observations

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I still wish they made a pill that could make your fingernails stop growing

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm just never going to clip these things on schedule

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
What else is going on?

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Boy, that vice president's up those old tricks

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Yes, Jeff?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Do you have really long fingernails right now?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
You know, they're dirty, gross claws

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
You should bite them

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I don't want to get a bite

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Bite them

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
No, I've never been tempted to do that

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Do it

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
No

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Do it right now

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
No

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Do it in front of this audience

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
This is exactly how the Donner party started

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
It was cold and they were locked in a cabin

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Someone's like, ah, God, I'm sorry

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
You should bite your nails, Gloria

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Bite them, bite them, now keep biting

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Now let us help

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I'm Gloria Donner

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
The first person eaten

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
At the Donner party

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
You guys saw that Hannibal prequel where they, uh, yeah, alright

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Where they like walk you through how, yeah, I've talked about that

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
The Donner party thing reminded me of that

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Because essentially part of Hannibal's, Hannibal Lecter's origin

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Is that he's like a little kid under the table at an Ursatz Donner party

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
That he's like under a table watching

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
That's his first experience in life is that sometimes people eat people

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Like they walk you through bit by bit, piece by piece

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Like how you could become Hannibal Lecter from being you

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
They remove all the fun out of the character

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
It's just like, hey, could happen to you, you could be Hannibal Lecter

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
He's not Peter Parker

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
We weren't going to that for that

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
He was bitten by a radioactive hungry person

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
I could give you some iPad app recommendations

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
They're not funny ones though

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
I don't want to start any more beefs with any more Franko's

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
I'm playing a game called Knights of Pen and Paper 2

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I played the first one

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
It's a great sequel to a great, if you like, role-playing games and like turn-based combat

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It's that

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
It's that and it's a great sequel

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
What classes are you running, Dan, for the people at home?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I have a lab rat wizard

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Boy, don't, I have a goth

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
A goth girl like a

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
That's not a class

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Sortie herder

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
She's got a big sword, I think she's a

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Especially, especially, you play the game too, I know

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I've played it, yeah, yeah

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
What do you, what do you play?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
What are your characters?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
You don't have a camera over there

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Schrab's doing a thing

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Is there any camera that can see that?

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Jeff just closed the door on Schrab

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Sorry, I'm going to fill you in on the backstory

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
The show has a phantom zone and

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Our general zods are sentenced there when they

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Try to usurp the son of Krypton

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Now he's sulking, he's sulking

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Alright, alright, let's bring him out

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Rob Schrab's here again

05:52.000 --> 06:06.000
Oh, damn it!

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Hey, Rob

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Hello

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
How you doing, man?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I'm doing alright, Jeffrey, how are you?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I'm fair to Midland

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
What's, uh, take us to your day, Rob

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
What'd you have for breakfast?

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Hmm, hmm

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
What did I have for breakfast?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I had, um, um

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Are you a breakfast guy?

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Not really, no, I have a, I have a

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
How come every time someone dies

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
You text me that you love me?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
What does that mean?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Am I supposed to say I love you too?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
What, was it Prince?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Wow, I don't want to say it's personal, actually

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
We lost a friend's

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I'm giving you a through line for your biopic

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
It's just a runner, is that?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
But is it, am I supposed to, is it after I die

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Or people go, he should have, he should have

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
He should have loved Schrab back

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
It's like, you know

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Was it Patton's wife?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Well, Jesus

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Yes, there was a death, there was a death

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Close to the, close to the dex

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
And, uh, every time though

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I'm saying it doesn't matter, it's a famous person

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
It's a friend, it's like every time

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I love you, you should take better care of

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Well, you don't say you should take better care of yourself

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I did, I did once

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
But you're like, I'm really concerned

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
The subtext is that I'm doing something wrong

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
By living

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
No, that is not, that is not

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
No

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
What is it, what is going on there?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I want you to know I love you

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
At those moments

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Robin Williams dies, I love you Dan

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
David Bowie, I love you Dan

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Prince

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Prince

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
What do you, what do you think I'm going to do?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Have a platinum record?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
I wish you would write better records

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
First

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I just, I just

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
In those moments

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
When you lose something special

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
You know, you just, you start

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Taking account

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Of

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
You shouldn't be insulted by it

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Or offended or hurt

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I'm confused by it

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I feel like the audience just

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Odd and then laughed at themselves

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And they were right

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Fair enough

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
No, no, we got this bit going on

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
That we don't like each other

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
And I want you to know that it's not true

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Well

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
When someone special dies for you, Rob

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
You think of the people special close to you

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
And you think of maybe the distance

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
The gulf between you and Dan

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
There's a lot of gulf

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
That go closer together

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah, which look at, look at physically

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
How I could

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Could not be further away

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
You could scoot, you could scoot two stools closer

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah, no

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Well, what, what, okay, okay

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I can't do this

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Well

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
We don't have a show, so why don't we do

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
A little holodeck scene where

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
You're not working

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
On the Lego 2 movie for seven and a half years

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And I'm not working on

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
950 projects for 900 years

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Oh, wow, biggest fan

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I'm getting the fuck out of this shit

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I've seen the hologram

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Beck

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Fuck that

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Tomorrow morning's blog entry starts

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I have colitis

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
It's hard

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I struggle with it all the time

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And my entire life people have been asking

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Why are you going to the bathroom

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Colitis

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I'm getting the fuck out

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
All right, so where do we take us

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
To the holodeck

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Where do we fade in?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
It probably takes a lot of fucking

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
If you sit in the front row and you have to

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Get up, it probably, you're probably like

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Holy shit, she's probably already

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Been through the whole thing

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Of like, god damn it

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I'm gonna have to do it, I'm gonna have to get up

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
She's like an old timey reporter

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Where she has to go to the phone booth and go

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Oh my god

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I got a hot story

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
All right, yeah, no

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
There's Schrab.every time

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Someone dies, I get a text

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I'm trying to give you

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Like an Edward runner

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Bella Lagosi calling

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
What are you setting up biopics for?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Just love me

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I'm trying, dude

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
But you're putting me on the spot

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Little bad

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Let's holodeck it, okay, let's holodeck

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Let's pretend

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Let's holodeck it out

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Let's holodeck like we used to

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Let's holodeck it, give me some water

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Throw me that one in the middle, all right, thanks

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
All right

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Okay, there we go

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Don't make it that kind of show

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
It's not

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
It's supposed to be a thoughtful show

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
This came here because we rejected

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
The concept of catching something is important

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
It's about connection, Dan

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
It's about human connection

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
All right, so if we're gonna holodeck it

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Where do you want to fade in

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Into this holodeck?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
She's back

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
She's back

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
She's wiping her seat down

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
She spilled cranberry juice

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
She spilled cranberry juice, Dan

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
It's not that big of a deal

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
She's wearing black

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Who cares?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
She's spilling cranberry juice, Dan

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
We all know it's not that big of a deal

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I know that's code for period

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh shit, is that right?

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Yes, I've got my cranberry juice

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
All right

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I have to go to the bathroom

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I haven't had a girlfriend in so long

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I don't know this

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I don't know these code words

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
All right, so holodeck

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Friendship with Schrab

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Where are we fading in to solve these problems?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
This is programmed to make me look bad

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
No, no, it's programmed to call your bluff

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Because when I get a text that says

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I love you, only when people die

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
It's like to me

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
The unspoken thing

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Is like, we don't see each other enough

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
We don't have a close enough relationship

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
You eat too much, you drink too much

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
But I've said that

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Here, out loud, I've said those words

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I don't have to have

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I don't have to do some kind of sleight of hand with a text

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I say that to your face

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, so why can't you just text Prince died?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I write

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
RIP Prince

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
What do you want?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Then you say, I love you, Dan

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
It's like so loaded

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Okay, well, fine

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
What do you...

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
No, I sound like a dick

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Gun to your head, what do you want?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
You want me to stop too?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Ah, fuck you

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
No, gun to your head, you want me to keep doing it

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Alright, look, gun to your head

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Virtual fishing boat

13:38.000 --> 13:48.000
Virtual fishing boat

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Shut up, shut up you scared the fucker

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Shut up

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Shut up, you scared the fish

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Shut up

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Is that the soundtrack?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
It's a whale

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
It's foggy

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
It's foggy

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
So it's good that we finally got this moment

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Alone

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
To be best friends

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Fishing together

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
So that we can finally hang out

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
And love each other

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Retired and this is it

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Thank God

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
None of us worked really hard until we dropped dead

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Without warning

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Thank God we did that

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Now we can enjoy this sunshine

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
And this fish

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Think of...

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Think of what we would have...

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I mean, oof

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I made you something

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Yeah

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Close your eyes

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Hold out your hand

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
It's my shit

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
The fuck

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
What the fuck, what the fuck

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Jetski

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
It's detachable

15:36.000 --> 15:52.000
Son of a bitch

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
No, no, no, no

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
Helicopter

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Say you don't love me anymore

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Stop telling me you love me

16:14.000 --> 16:32.000
I love you, dad

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I wrote it

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I did

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm so sorry

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm just gonna land some of my angel wings

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Don't have to

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Flap so much

16:54.000 --> 17:04.000
Can we get back to fishing, please?

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Dad killed you and you still want to hang out with him and fish with him?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I put shit in his hand

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
He killed himself

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I gave him an out

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Alright, that didn't work

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Alright, well I hope you enjoyed

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
This level of show

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Alright, next guest

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Do you not want to be loved by Rob?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
You just don't want to be loved when people die

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
And that's when you feel loved by him most

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
Makes him uncomfortable, it makes him uncomfortable to hear

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
Are you loving him more when famous people die than other ones?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
No, when anybody dies

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
When just death is happening

17:46.000 --> 17:52.000
I'm like that with Kate, I'm like that with Lolly, I'm like that with a lot of people

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
And Dan, you feel you don't want to be loved only when mortality is the thing

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Makes him uncomfortable, it makes him uncomfortable

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Well, he doesn't put anyone

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
The same thing with my mom

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
She'll like send me a direct tweet or something

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
And it'll say like, be nice to hear from you now and then

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
Like, bitch, you got my number

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Text me

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I called her bluff, I said you can text me anytime

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Well, I wouldn't want to bother you

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Bother me, she never does

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
She doesn't text me

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
But do you want her to?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I don't know

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I don't know

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I've text you, what up, what up man?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
What's going on man?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
What do I do?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
You don't write back

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
You don't have to scratch your head

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
You're in workaholic mode where like you're busy as a mother fucker all the time

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah, you got no time

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
You have the best excuse to not reply because you're always working, you have the best out

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
I get it

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Also sometimes they put his phone in a box

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Yeah

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Say what?

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
Sometimes like a small man comes and puts his phone into a box

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Alright

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
His name is Steve Levy

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Rob, are you a fan of the horror film genre?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Yes, I am actually, yes

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Do you like cinema?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I like cinemas, yes, I like them

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
Well, our next guest

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
Is, he played the, I think the most recent Jason Voorhees

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Yes, he did

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
I think he must have done a terrible job because they kind of like, they stopped making those movies

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
I think he must have killed people wrong

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I think he killed him

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
He killed everybody in the movie, he was too good

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Oh, he's too good

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
He hunted himself to extinction

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah, every Jason Voorhees movie has to, alright, okay

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Well, he's an old friend of ours

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
And I don't think he's ever been up on this podcast, just hanging out

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
Don't look at me, you know the roster better than I do

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Please welcome Derek Mears

20:04.000 --> 20:14.000
Yeah!

20:14.000 --> 20:26.000
Oh, shit

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
Derek

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
I just spilled my cranberry juice

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Yeah, come on over on this side of the stage there

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
195, episode 195

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Oh yeah, we're coming up on 200, we should do something special

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Yeah

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
For that episode

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
195

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
I wanted to do a gag tonight where I get so mad at Schrab, I'm chasing him around like some crates

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
And then he runs behind a crate, and then you come out the other side

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
And it just puts me off of chasing Schrabs forever

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
Don't tell the audience, it's gonna be great, let's do it

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
How come that Harmon hates Schrabs so much?

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
It's an old Looney Tunes joke

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
Just smiling him politely, Niley

21:18.000 --> 21:26.000
For the crowd here that doesn't know our origin story, we know Derek, all of us, Dan, Rob and I, through comedy sports

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
We're Bakersfield comedy sports

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Yeah

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Rob and Dan were Milwaukee

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Milwaukee

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I was LA and we all met at certain tournaments

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
And we all met, like, remember sitting with Derek Mears

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
I'll talk to you in the first person

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
Sitting with Derek and we saw the Bert Fershner's play in Milwaukee

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And you and I sat next to each other

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
And it was like Mike Rock, Chris Thom, and all of our New York friends

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
And we saw something so funny that you and I looked at each other like, fuck this shit

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
We were actually unhappy at how funny things were

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Yeah, they were too good

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
And Rob and Dan were in The Dead Elwives

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
And again, these guys are funnier than we are, so fuck it

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
They're like, go home, we're done, totally done

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Oh, you were watching us?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Yeah

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
You saw something so funny that you were like, let's quit forever

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
And those things were Dan Harmon

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
Well, actually

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
I thought Sean McKenna was the funniest Dead Elwives

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
It's true

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Because he was the most punk rock

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
You guys were all funny, you guys were all hilarious, but he was so dangerous and so weird

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
I came from LA comedy sports, which was so safe

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
So by the numbers, these guys were actually punk rockers in the improv world

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
And we all ended up hanging out on the sidelines and becoming friends

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
And my friendship with Rob, Dan, all you guys coincided with Derek Mears

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
Do you guys think Kanye West gets a bad rap?

23:08.000 --> 23:16.000
I feel like everybody...

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
He does a good rap, too

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
He's never, as far as I know, he's never hit anybody or abused anybody

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
And he's got seven number one albums in a row

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
We keep waiting for him to become humble or normal

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
I think he's just a lunatic, right?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
He's got seven number one albums in a row

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I think a lot of it's just a big show

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
Kind of like an Alice Cooper, Marilyn Manson on the metal side, but on the hip hop side

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
He does things just to get people's mindset and to be in the consciousness

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Yeah

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
You know what he just did though?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Well, he didn't just do it, he did it a while ago

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
He was like, my album's always gonna be on title, only title forever

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
And then it wasn't

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
So like a lot of people subscribe to title under false pretenses

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
And now there's a class action lawsuit or something

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
What? What?

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Title, the subscription program or thing, service

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
Music streaming subscription by Jay-Z, right?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I don't know anything about that

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
He's got all this talent, right?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
He's trying to get talent on his side

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Kanye's like, it's only gonna be on title

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
If you want talent, it's gonna be on title

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
You best subscribe

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
And then it comes out not on title

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
And everyone's like, well, what the fuck?

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
What are we doing this for? We could just buy albums like normal people?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Shit, well

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Still, though, a lot of people hit women

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Yeah, no, no

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
And piss on people and stuff

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
That's still not bad, I gotta say

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
And I feel like if you're gonna tear up someone's floor of their set

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
You just run it by them in their dressing room

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Just go, hey, we gotta tear up the floor of your set

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
It's mirrors

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
It doesn't work for the cameras

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
He'd probably be like, okay, cool, I'm Picasso and Jesus

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Okay, cool, we're SNL

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Goodbye, but they didn't tell him

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Of course he's gonna be like, what the fuck?

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
They didn't even tell me, I'm Picasso and Jesus

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
And someone's recording him from 50 yards going, this is the best

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
Are you comparing yourself to Kanye or Jesus Ringer?

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
What he's taught me is it doesn't matter

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
We should all be a little more proud of ourselves, for God's sake

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Seven number one albums

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
Four albums ago is when he needed to stop being humble

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
By our own rules that we've established

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
Three number one albums you're allowed to start wearing a shoe for a hat

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
We established that a long time ago

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Are you a big Kanye fan?

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
I don't really like his music, but I like his personality

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
You just want permission to be Kanye West

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
Well, no, I'm just defending a guy who's like, yeah

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
It's adorable that people were like

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
That lady was like, he sticks stuff in his butt

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
And then it's amazing that he bothers to get on Twitter

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
He's like, come on, seriously, I don't like anything in my butt

26:13.000 --> 26:20.000
It's him, it's not like a PR company going like, speaking of butt, go to Target

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
It's like him going like, come on, come on, y'all, I don't put anything in my butt

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
It's great, it's accessible

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Is this similar to how people don't like to drink alone?

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
The narcissism level, like, look at me, this is amazing

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
And so he's that big, and you're like, I look up to him someday

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
I don't know, I don't know what that means

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
I don't know where the insult begins

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Oh, no, it's playful, like a kitten insult

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
It's not like I'm going to hurt you, stab you in the face

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
Well, you can't, I'm like Picasso, you can't stab me

26:51.000 --> 26:57.000
You'd be stabbing thin air, I'm Jesus

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
So you want to be Kanye, like you like

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
I am, I am, aren't I?

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
I am Kanye

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
Should we holodeck this?

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
Holodeck, just me being Kanye

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Okay

27:14.000 --> 27:22.000
And the winner for Best Musician for the MTV Music Awards is

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
You want to read the envelope?

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
Shenane

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Alright, put your ears and hands together

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
It's Kanye West

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
You know what?

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
This is bullshit, this is bullshit

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Taylor Swift, get up here

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Taylor, Taylor, get up here

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
She deserves this award

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
This is bullshit, I didn't work my ass off

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
Taylor Swift did

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
She deserves it

27:56.000 --> 28:02.000
I didn't know what else to do with that

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
Taylor, Kanye

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, soul powers

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Oh, you're so tasty, so delicious, Kanye

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Cut to black, Taylor

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Pentagon, 1978

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Pentagon

28:30.000 --> 28:39.000
Oh, shit, went the wrong way

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
I think it's like, where is it?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
It's three lefts, two rights

28:47.000 --> 28:59.000
Alright, finally, I've been looking for you guys forever

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
I went to a room, there was a guy

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
So anyways, we have a problem

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
Well, we're the guys that help you with that

29:14.000 --> 29:20.000
Operation Delta has been a failure

29:20.000 --> 29:26.000
Oh, the old Operation Delta is a failure

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Yeah, that we suspected is my...

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
Yeah, we didn't put our all into that one

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
Oh, fuck, oh shit

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
Fire drill

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
It's like we just know the air is going down

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
We gotta get out of here

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
It's a regular fire drill, we try to keep it

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
You know, everybody says don't use an elevator, fuck that shit

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Let's use the elevator

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Yeah, yeah

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
It's in the way that you use it, doo, doo

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
Believe me, it's so much quicker than it was there

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
So how about what Sally was wearing today?

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
Oh, what else, what?

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
I mean, are you working for the Pentagon?

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
The J.C. Pennies are gone

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
Did the elevator stop and the doors not open?

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
We're only on the Quatra-Gone level

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
Press the button again just in case

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
It's in the way that you use it, doo, doo

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
The buttons went up

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
Okay, doo, fuck

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Let's go out

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Oh my god

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
That doesn't mean anything

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
That doesn't mean anything, it means the doors are about to open

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Because they're trying to save electricity

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
What?

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
I don't want to freak you guys out

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
But when the stuff like this happens, if I can't see things

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I have little flashbacks as a child

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
And I start to get uncomfortable

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
And weird things happen

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Okay

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
Cut to Derek's flashbacks as a child

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
Son, happy birthday

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
This is your new hammock

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Thanks, this is so comfortable

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I've never had anything like this before

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Hey, Derek, fatty Derek

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Snip, snip

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
No, no!

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
God damn it, no!

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Back to the elevator

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
And she was really mean to me

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And so that's what happened

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
She called you fatty Karen?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
She had like a speech impediment

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Really high-pitched voice

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
She couldn't say my name right

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Derek Karen Mears

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
The lights are still out, you guys

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
If you don't know

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
I've taken control of your elevator car

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Kanye West

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
You have 30 seconds

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
To make the greatest rap album of all time

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
He can do it!

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
He can do it!

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
He can do it!

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
You're Jesus Picasso, you can do it!

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
You can do it!

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Really confined in here

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Yeah, well, we'll sit down

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Well, no, that's...

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Alright, that kind of...

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Alright, okay

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Yeah

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Aw yeah

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Put your elevator action together

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
For K.W. West

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
A circle is a daydream

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
A circle is a square to me

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
A circle is another shape

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
Inside my spool and playground

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
I'm singing like a lady

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
I'm singing like I've never had

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Tomorrow

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
I'm singing like I love the shapes

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
Of circles and squares and triangles

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
When the grass is green

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
And the sun is yellow

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
I saw your mama tonight

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
I heard she's turned into

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
A fellow

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
That's not transphobic

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I support her

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Wholeheartedly

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
In her change

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
If she wants to be

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Whoever she wants to be

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
She should be

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
She should be

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
She should be

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
She should be

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
She should be

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
She should be

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Tomorrow

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
A circle is a square

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
Every sun is a rainbow

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Every day is today

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Unless, unless

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
It turns into tomorrow

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
A triangle is three

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
A square is more than that

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
A circle has zero

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
But you are a hero

34:44.000 --> 34:56.000
If you want to know that

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
Come on

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
And then I do nine more songs like that

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
I mean, obviously you've been bested

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
It's like we have a budget for the elevator narrator

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
And we don't have the budget for the elevator maintenance

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
No wonder we lost the last three wars

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Yeah, it's crazy

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Can't see my watch

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Ah, finally

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Thank God the ghost is here

35:29.000 --> 35:38.000
He's got some door

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Come through mine

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Thanks, my only friend

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
Let's get you a new hammock

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
I had nothing to do with a hammock

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
I was in his flashback

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
You know what?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I'm scrubbing the Delta project

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
That's what I came to tell you guys

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
I was going to take you to lunch

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Break it to you slowly over mozzarella sticks

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
You admitted yourselves

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
You phoned it in

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Mozzarella stick

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Ah, get your own now

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
So long

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
But you should

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
What's he doing with that apple?

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
He's eating it

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
It's a nano-apple

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
So long

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Suckers

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
Wasn't that nano-apple part of the Delta project?

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
It was, but I think he meant it to be achieved

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
A cheese dick

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
A cheese dick?

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Yes

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Want to go back to giving me head?

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Credits

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
Music

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Was it like that?

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Exactly

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Could we have a serious conversation for a second?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Dan, I love you

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Who died?

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
That scene

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Spencer, how have you been?

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
I've been so good

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
There's something in

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I know, you've been messing with it

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
And looking at it for minutes

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
What do you think, what is it?

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
Drink it, man, just drink it

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
You got some sort of weird thing in your vodka?

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
This is like the lowest-stakes creep show ever

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I know it's in here, there's something

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
There's just something down there

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
There's some jewels or whatever it is, I got it

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
Oh, it's the reflection of my finger

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
Oh, no

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
You're like a bird

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
No, it's still there, oh, but that's us, okay

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Oh, man

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I'm very phobic about impurities and stuff

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Yeah

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
Whatever's in there, vodka will probably kill it, right?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Yeah, yeah

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Or the snakes will

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I love you so much

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Thank you

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
Derek, tell us about getting kicked in the nuts by Will Smith

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
In Wild Wild West

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
Oh my god, yeah, as an actor I was very lucky

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
At one point, one of my first jobs was working on the stellar hit

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Wild Wild Wild West

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Wild Wild West won

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Yeah

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
Did you play the robot spider?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Attack of the robot spiders

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
Yes, actually I was the giant metalhead guy inside the spider

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
And I was super nervous because I had to hit Will Smith for the first time

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
Punching him and whatnot, but he had to kick me in the nards as well

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
But when we were doing it, we had, when you get kicked in the nards

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
You get usually a safety strap that goes around your ankle

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
All the way up through here, kind of like a belt, so if someone hits you

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
It stops them from actually hitting your nard parts

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Yeah, hold on, it gets good

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
It's like a hammock, upside down hammock

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Above the ground that is your nuts

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Absolutely

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
It's supposed to hold the body that is Will Smith's ankle

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
As he does the plopping into it of kicking as hard as he can upward

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
And that is the correct term, plopping

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
As hard as he might try, if he kicks straight up in your dick

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
He's not going to get there because it's attached to your feet

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
Correct, but if you go up at an angle, you get hit hard

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
In the thigh

40:08.000 --> 40:14.000
In the upper groin area where the connection between your hoop and the hop come together

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
And your nuts are huge

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
They're average man nuts

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
But you're bigger than an average man, so like you say like

40:28.000 --> 40:35.000
Oh, this Diet Coke is average size, but it's like you drink a special giant Diet Coke can

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
Wait, how big are like, what's average nut size?

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Like a quarter? Like is that a nut?

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Yeah, like a quarter

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
Spencer's giant, he has to make it like two times my size of nuts

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I'm special

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Also what do you have behind the show? Quality

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Quality is the entire time

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
So anyways, the story that you're making me tell

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
We did it about like

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
I expected you to go, I don't want to talk about that

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
About 20 takes happened, not one was straight up and they were side to side

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
And I felt like a kickboxer because it got to the point where I kept getting kicked over and over

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
And it's kind of like like Rocky where he like he'd start to buckle and be like

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
When I was a kid, I was so new going, no, no, no, this is good, I keep going

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
He's not kicking straight up, he's kicking into the thigh

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Yeah, yeah

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
And you want it straight up

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
I'm assuming not kicking you straight up because Instinct says

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
If I kick this guy as hard as I can straight up, that's going to be like kicking a human being in the balls

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
So he's kicking you into the thigh

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Yes

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Probably to be a good person but he's doing it wrong

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
Correct, but he makes more than I do and he can hire me in the future

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
He did it completely right and it was my fault

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
But no, afterwards I had it just like just think of the blackest purple

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
Like I went to the trailer and I kind of hobbled to the trailer and lay there and just had these giant

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
Like volleyball size on both sides like bruises

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
And the thing is when you're a young stuntman, like I think what you expressed to me is like

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
You're in this terrible dilemma because it's like you can't stop between the 30th take

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
And by the way, I met the dude that was in an acting class

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Yes, believe it or not

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
He was in an acting class at Sam Christiansen's class

42:20.000 --> 42:26.000
And one of the classmates was the guy who played Marco in Die Hard

42:26.000 --> 42:32.000
Who is the guy who says, next time you're going to shoot somebody, don't hesitate

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
Thanks for the advice, oh

42:36.000 --> 42:44.000
That guy, I'm sorry, but because I was thinking of that guy because he told me

42:44.000 --> 42:49.000
Because he's a stuntman, a lot of the terrorists in Die Hard, they're just stuntmen

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
Because they had to do rolls and dives and tucks and nips and things

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
And he's like

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
So racist

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
A moment of silence for that moment of silence

43:05.000 --> 43:15.000
He ruined his back during Die Hard, I think he never could do stunt work again

43:15.000 --> 43:20.000
Because that was his biggest gig and it was the most benign thing you'd see in Die Hard

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
There's a moment when he's talking and then some dudes come in the doorway

43:25.000 --> 43:31.000
And he goes, they catch Bruce Willis off guard and he draws down on them

43:31.000 --> 43:36.000
And there's just a two second shot of the doorway and the guy's scatter

43:36.000 --> 43:42.000
And in that shot, Marco vaults over an office chair, does a little dive

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
It's not that big a deal, the movie's not called Rhythm Gymnastics Hard

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
It's not like, whoa, they'll blow you away with the wonderful cartwheels

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
But he did this move that he then had to do 46 times

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
Literally, I think they did 46 takes of that shot

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
And he could never stop at take 23 and say

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
I'm out, I can't do this, I'm going to ruin my body

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
And you, Will Smith is kicking you in the nuts for the 18th time

44:07.000 --> 44:13.000
And you're faced with this crazy choice of like, well, what am I going to be the stuntman that's gotten this far

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
And then goes, I can't take it, boys

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
You're allowed to at any point say, okay, I'm hurt

44:20.000 --> 44:26.000
But if you do, they go, oh, shit, go home and we never hire you again

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
Yeah, I think if you're a veteran, you probably get away with it more, right?

44:29.000 --> 44:34.000
Well, the mentality between acting as stunts, it's white collar, blue collar

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
On the stunt side of things, like your job is to make the stunt winner who hired you look as good as possible

44:39.000 --> 44:45.000
So if you ever get hurt or injured on set, you shouldn't as a professional scream out

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
And go, ah, my arm is broken and I can't feel, you'd be very quiet

44:48.000 --> 44:53.000
And if you're hurt, you leave set so you don't cause that panic on set and people freak out

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
Because you'll interrupt the work day, then they don't make their day and then there's money involved and what not

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
But you go in, you take it, you wrap whatever hurt and you go back and you finish the job for the day

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
If your mentality's right and then you heal up later

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
You got pretty hurt, a separated shoulder or something like that?

45:10.000 --> 45:15.000
Oh, no, no, I had a really bad herniated disc in my neck, it was the toughest job I've ever done

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
I did Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters. I was just going to bring that up

45:18.000 --> 45:24.000
I couldn't wait to bring that up because I watched that entire movie, I thought that fucker was CG

45:24.000 --> 45:31.000
That was you in a costume, that troll, that big ogre thing, there was two in a costume

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
Yeah, that was crazy, we shot three months in Berlin, the first week there

45:36.000 --> 45:42.000
Anything you do for these kind of monster jobs, because an actor, I bounce to my normal face and doing monsters from time to time

45:42.000 --> 45:47.000
But anytime you do a monster job, you're always prepared ahead of time, like I always talk about a UFC fighter

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
You over train, so when you're on set, nothing's going to faze you

45:50.000 --> 45:56.000
But the suit was so difficult because the studio wanted to CG the character and the producers and the director were finding

45:56.000 --> 46:01.000
No, we want to do it practical, we have the right people and the right team together, let's do it practical

46:01.000 --> 46:06.000
And they're like, okay, we'll try it, but the suit was so big, I try to explain to people like when you put it on

46:06.000 --> 46:14.000
It's like being on a treadmill with like a hundred plus pound of weight on your neck, shoulders, all over you

46:14.000 --> 46:21.000
You're breathing your own carbon dioxide, so you can't breathe very well, your pulse is already, you're actually cooking inside the suit

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
So imagine that, putting a plastic bag on your head and running, blind

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
And Will Smith kicking you in the nuts the entire time

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
But yeah, it was crazy, I got to love it

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
And he wasn't even on that job, he just shows up to fuck a kid

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
Will Smith just fucking goes from set to set

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Well, he became addicted to it, that's the thing

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Where'd you get a taste for it?

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
He started to make excuses in your head, I deserved it, I shouldn't have made him do that

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
It's called addiction, it's called addiction

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
On Will Smith's behalf, it was my first big Hollywood star going, oh my god, I don't want to ruin this

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
He was the nicest, most down-to-earth guy, I was talking to one of his entourage at the time

46:58.000 --> 47:04.000
Is he doing a game or is he legit, no no no man, Will Smith is Will Smith 24 hours a day

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
And he treated, it didn't matter if you were the caterer all the way up to the main producer

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
He treated everybody equally with respect and I was blown away

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
I went a lot from him

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Alright, now Derek

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
Yeah, sounds pretty cool

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
Sounds pretty cool

47:21.000 --> 47:26.000
I'd like to work with him someday

47:26.000 --> 47:31.000
Derek, am I getting this wrong, Derek and I used to be roommates for a while back in the day

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Yeah

47:32.000 --> 47:37.000
And when you auditioned for that, they had you come in

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
For Wild Wild West

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
For Wild Wild West

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
One

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
And they did some kicks and stuff like that

47:44.000 --> 47:50.000
Wasn't there a thing like they said, do like a high kick and you're like, no, I'll kick a hole in the ceiling

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
No, there's a small room or whatever and there's like a low hanging, my background's like martial arts and stuff

47:55.000 --> 48:00.000
And so they're like, go ahead and do, can you kick over your head and go, yeah, I can stop here

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
I don't know why, because I'll kick the light thing, I don't want to do that

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
And they're like, go ahead and do it

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
Yeah, yeah, honey, kick to it

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
You kicked the ceiling out and they're like, you got the fucking Jeff

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
Also on a side note, like being Jeff's roommate, talk about like

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
You, you, you

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Talk about

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
If you want to

48:23.000 --> 48:28.000
Motherfucker leaves the toilet seat up, the refrigerator door open

48:28.000 --> 48:34.000
If you just moved to Hollywood and you're looking for self-confidence, don't move in with Davis

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
That guy is a, no, sweetheart of a human being, like Jeff's like a brother to me

48:39.000 --> 48:46.000
Well, all of his waking nightmares about 9-11, like

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
I would date skinny, like weak, like, you know, thin actresses

48:57.000 --> 49:04.000
Derek would date giant, hard-ass stunt women who like, look like, like Xena, warrior princess

49:04.000 --> 49:09.000
So I'd be in my little bedroom and we'd be like, maybe, oh, no

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Like, you should eat something

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
And that was him talking to me

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Stunt talk

49:17.000 --> 49:24.000
And then from Derek's room, it was boom, come on, they were doing, like, you guys were wrestling so hard

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Furniture was flying

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Wrestling

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
Me and my skinny actress girlfriend were like, well, are they okay?

49:31.000 --> 49:36.000
Like, yeah, they're, oh, I live with a superhero

49:38.000 --> 49:44.000
Also, Derek would do a thing, first time we lived at the Serrano, like in the Koreatown

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
Yeah

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
Derek, you know, he's, what are you, six?

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Six-five

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Six-five

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
Totally hairless, very, very, very muscular

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
He's trying to create a picture for you

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
Yeah

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
For the home listener

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
It's a podcast

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Kind of a Mr. Clean look

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
It's a podcast

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Mr. Clean

50:06.000 --> 50:12.000
Derek would come out and, like, I'd be playing his PlayStation, I'd be doing some Tomb Raider or whatever

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
And Derek would come out and his tidy whiteies

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
And he would do this

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Oh, boy

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
I called it the pretty prancer

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
You wanna come out with a photo?

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
You wanna come out of the bathroom?

50:25.000 --> 50:30.000
Imagine him and naked, except for tidy whiteies

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
And he would go like

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Jeff

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
Jeff, am I a pretty prancer?

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
Yes, Derek

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
You're a pretty pony

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
It was the best

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Oh, good times, good times

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
But the point I was trying to make with Jeff coming over

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
With Jeff as a roommate is, like, I would sit there and I had the same spot on the couch

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
I was that friend, you know, who's, like, disheveled and like, oh, it's gonna play Tomb Raider on PlayStation 2

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
It was great

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
And it was, like, a cat, like, a revolving door of, like, beautiful, hot, like, eccentric women would come in

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
And, like, I would sit there and they're talking, like, Don Perignon

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
I feel like the kid from Deliverance would be like, hey, what's going on?

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
You know, Jeff's a real funny dude, you should have a good time tonight

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
But they had to put up with me, because, like, you know, they're dating Jeff and then we were close

51:39.000 --> 51:44.000
Like, oh, you guys could have leaned into that, you could have done, like, just skin tight latex

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
Like, on a Friday night, like, are you going out tonight?

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna probably bring some women up, you want me to do the, you know, the thing?

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
Yeah

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
You want me to just be in the cabinet under the sink?

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
That would be amazing

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
And then you do your high kicks

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
And then Will Smith comes out of a different cabinet, starts kicking in the nuts

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
Is that Will Smith? He's really nice

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
Derek, flat footed, flat footed, you could kick the ceiling probably here, right?

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
I think I can

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Still?

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
Oh, well, I'm still, I'm tighter than I used to be, I could fall, it'd be awesome

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
You got them tattooed or paint, pants on

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
Just, try, try, I mean, I think, flat, oh yeah, you

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
He's wearing jeans, whoa

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Jesus Christ

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
He kicked it

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Whoa

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
Jesus

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Jesus

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
He chopped it

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Nice

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Yeah

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Yeah, that must work

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
Guys, if any sort of terror erupts, I got your back

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Dan

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Dan's trying to kick it

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
This is a, this is a horrible idea

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Game recognized game

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Dan

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
Nice

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Nice

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Great

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
Great

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
You really are Picasso Jesus

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
I was actually kind of curious, like how, like what the disparity is

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
Like how, how far my leg goes up, I think it was like

53:24.000 --> 53:31.000
You got pretty close

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
What, yeah

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
What, so

53:38.000 --> 53:44.000
See, if you go to your chiropractor and it's like, oh, he's fixed your back

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
And then he's like, have you done those exercises?

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
And you, you haven't

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
And then you, because you're busy

53:51.000 --> 53:55.000
And then you're like, if I just say no

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
Then I, which I've already tried, I've tried to be honest

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
He goes like, have you done those exercises?

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
They're like core exercises, like where you work your core

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
It's for my posture

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I don't like my posture

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
But I don't, I don't like doing the exercises either

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
So my hands are tied

54:14.000 --> 54:19.000
So, so I, like, so once a week I go into him and he goes like, he's adjusting my back

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
And then he goes, did you do those exercises?

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
And then I tried, I already tried, I tried

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Oh, okay, that's fine, that's the, that's the same as my alarm tone

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
It's worth, because we live in an Orwellian society

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
It's not like yours was going to be, it's in the way that you use it

54:38.000 --> 54:46.000
Kevin Day is like, god damn it, fucking, that's Eric Clapton, fucking, it just gets sued

54:46.000 --> 54:51.000
The, I don't do the, so I already tried, I tried going

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
No, by the way, now I'm not going to tell you his name

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
Because then you might yell at him and like harass him

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Dr. X, Dr. X

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
No, Dr. X, by the way, X is his first name

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Because not a real doctor, chiropractor

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
It's like Dr. Todd, you know

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
No, Dr. Todd, I did not do the exercises this week

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I didn't do them

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
And then his reaction is like, okay, well, can I ask you a question?

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Do you want to have better posture?

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Yes, I do, Dr. Todd

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
Well, you can't have it if I can't help you if you're, if you're going to

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Because if you don't want to do it, then you don't want to do it

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
Wasn't he like, well, if you want, don't want to waste my time

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
Or like something like, he was wasting your time

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Well, that's when I cancel an appointment

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
He was like, but it's like, I pay for the appointment

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
Oh, I thought he was like, you're not going to stretch, you're just wasting my time

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
Well, he was like, well, if you don't, if you don't want to do it

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Like, I don't know what to do with you

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
And so then I tried lying a little bit

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Like, so then the next time he goes like, do you know the exercises?

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
I hadn't, and so I tried lying just enough

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
Because I didn't get the right, it was like, so I was like, yeah, a couple times

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
He's like, yeah, like, how often?

56:03.000 --> 56:08.000
I'm like, oh, here and there, like once every other day

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
Trying a little bit, and then he said, well, I can't, you know

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Look, I mean, I want to help your posture, but I can't

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
I can't work with you if it's like, oh, once every other day

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
And I did an impression of my voice and like

56:19.000 --> 56:24.000
And it was like, I was just like, I got my face in a table while he's doing that shit

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
And I'm like, I just like, I don't need to put up with this

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
This motherfucker's supposed to crack my back

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
But then I think, well, what if I stop going to him?

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
And then my back feels bad

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
And then you'll know he works

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
That seems like the best idea

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
And then he's like, I don't know

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Like I throw a pebble at his window

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
Dr. Todd!

56:48.000 --> 56:54.000
I hold up a boombox and it's playing the shitty music version of

56:54.000 --> 56:59.000
Whatever he plays over his fucking shitty new age sound system

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I'll touch you twice

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
Now, have you tried actually doing his instructions and doing that?

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Yeah, they're...

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
Let's do them right now

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
No, they're on the...

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
No, don't applaud that

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
No, no, no, no, they'll applaud for this

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
Let's do it

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
I think if you did it right now, then you could be truthful

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
You don't like lying

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
No, I don't

57:17.000 --> 57:22.000
He won't even accept, I already know that even if I did him a lot, according to me

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
That wouldn't be enough for him

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Okay, then definitely don't do him

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
Yeah, yeah

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Stop it

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
So do I have to stop going to him?

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
No

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
What?

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
He's trying to help you

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
But I don't have time to do the exercises, bro

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
Wait, what are the exercises and how long?

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
Like 15 seconds

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
I just got to lay down on the floor and go like this

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
It's like for my core, I don't have a core

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
Do it every time you have to pee

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
15 seconds?

57:52.000 --> 57:56.000
You can't even try it just as an experiment to see if he's a good decorator

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
If history is any teacher, no, I cannot, I'm not able to do it

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
It doesn't work into my schedule right now

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I can't have Steve Levy put on my calendar

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
Do it when you pee

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
Thrust your fucking hips for 15 seconds

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
My calendar already looks like this

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Every day is like, what?

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Read the Bible

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
What?

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
I have to do so much shit

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
There's going to be slivers added in there

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Thrust your hips against the wall

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Have you cut Minecraft out of your schedule?

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Dude

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
Yeah, is that Steve Levy?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Yeah, I don't play no Minecraft

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Nights of pen and paper too

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
I got a couple hours in yesterday

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
I don't touch console games or laptop games

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
I only do iPad time management games

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
They're teaching me time management

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Are you still in pain? Is your back like...

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
No, that's the thing

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
So why would I ever do these exercises?

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
Don't go, don't go

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
You sound like you're busy

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
You sound so busy, Dan

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
You sound so busy

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
You need to relax, take it easy

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
Don't go

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
If you don't like him

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
You don't like him

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
You don't like what he's telling you to do

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Stop it, just don't go

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
I worry about you, man

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
Don't go, just stay home

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Well...

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
Steve, can you put on the calendar

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
I'm supposed to lay on the ground

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
There's a piece of paper that shows a lady doing it

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
It's like, I got a...

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
It doesn't even make sense

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
You're talking about a breast exam

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Can you show us how to fix it?

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
No, I can't, because it's a stage

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
No, I can't show you

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
I'll describe it

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
I'll describe it if you do it

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
Show us what you're supposed to do

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
It's going to look like a man laying down

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Yeah, well, let's try it out

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
But if you do it in the future

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
And they ask you, did you do it or not

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
You can play your hit podcast

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
And have everybody go, yeah

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Maybe these people

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
You're witnesses

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
You can do it on a table

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I can do it on the table

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Do it on the table

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Don't do it on the table

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Lay down on the table

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
That's a bad idea

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
That table seems like it's not really on the table

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
That would be perfect

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Do it on the table

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Just do it on the table

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
This is great

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Oh, shit

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I hate these parts of the podcast

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Because it's like I always imagine

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Being the person that's here for the first time

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Like, why did you take me here?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Well, because he's a great writer

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
He's not writing

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
He's laying his back with his knees up

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Okay, so this is the exercise

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Like, I think

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
He's kind of off, people

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I go like this

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
One

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I think I just go like that, I think

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I can't remember it

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
No, no, no

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I keep my ass on the floor

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
And then the smaller my back

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Is supposed to be like that

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And you keep reaching for the stars

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
And then

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And then I flatten it

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And then I go like that

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And then I flatten it

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
He's arching his back

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Right

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Or

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I'm just looking right at your crotch

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I can't see anything

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
So podcast dynamite, right?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Right

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
No, no, no

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
We're getting you some exercise

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
You have plausible deniability now

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
With your chiropractic

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
If he said once a week, do it

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Then I could do it every week here

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Yeah

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
You could put on a rap beat

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And I could do a chorus

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Yeah

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Yeah

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Do it to the beat

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Yeah

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Yeah

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Do it to the beat

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Yeah

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Strengthen your core

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Yeah

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Yeah

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Strengthen your core

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Yeah

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Yeah

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
There's a group of muscles

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Between your ass and your back

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
It's called your core

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Gonna keep your life on track

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It's gonna make your posture clean

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Gonna make it neat

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I'm gonna fuck your mama so hard

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Bringing the heat pad

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Heat pad

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Going down on your cool crack

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You fuck your mama so hard

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
She's going forward and back

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I cure her back

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
You're straightening her spine

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I fucked your mama like

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Curly fucked her like Larry Fine

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Whoa

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Dr. Moe

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Dr. Howard

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Dr. Fine

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Paging your mama just in time

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Got the three stooges to room 213

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I fucked your mama so hard

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
You know what I mean

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
An enthusiastic applause

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
There are three kinds of applause in the world

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Enthusiastic

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Everybody put your hands together for Kanye Jesus

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Oh shit

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Kanye Jesus

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Yo

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Yo

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Mr. Back Problems

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Mr. Back Problems

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Coming around of a new character

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Mr. Back Problems

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I love bad back

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
So much the rhythm of the bad back

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
So Mr. Back Problems

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Mr. Back Problems

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
It's a new character

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Mr. Back Problems

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Mr. Back Problems

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Don't Andy

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Stand up and show people why I would confuse you

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I'm not a dick

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
We're rating a super race

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.000
If these guys, this would be a perfect tag team wrestling match

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
The banger brothers are coming out

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Oh here come the follicle friends

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Hey Derek remember

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Before Channel 101 was a thing

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Dan, Rob, Chris, Tom and I would get together

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Let's make Jaws 4

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
No one has seen Jaws 4

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Let's make Jaws 4

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Rob made the most shocking thing in the world

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
It's kind of the beginning of everything for me

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Exactly

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Rob fucked a lemon

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Pretty hard

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Orange or a lemon

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
It was an orange but it was a little on the yellow side

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
It came off lemon on camera

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
My dick was Jaws

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Your dick was Jaws

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
He made a duct tape fin with a number 4 on it

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Am I right in saying that Bill Cosby was invoked?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
No it was Michael Cain

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
But he talked like Bill Cosby

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
He sounded like Bill Cosby

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Oh I'm Michael Cain

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Is that still online?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
It's the worst

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Comedy Central put it on their homepage at one point

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Not realizing that my dick was in it

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Because Sarah said

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Sarah loved it

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Sarah saw that video and said

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I want this guy to direct my pilot

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
And then somebody said

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Oh it's like on 101

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
And then they went

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Oh okay we'll put a link up to that

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It was up there for like a week

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And people were going

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Holy shit

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
A little warning

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
There's a dick in it

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Don't do it and then they pulled it down

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
There's one line of dialogue and I won't repeat

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
It's pretty out there

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
You know what I'm talking about

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
No

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I'm not going to say it

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Okay

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I will let the audience watch it

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I don't think it's up there anymore

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
YouTube won't have it?

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Jaws for it must exist

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I don't think so

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
It's so good

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I can't believe it's not out there

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
But then I think right after that

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
We all said

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Let's make

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Everybody make the next Batman

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Yeah

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And so Dan made a Batman

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Which is also

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
If you haven't seen Dan Harmon with Batman

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Dan's Batman is pretty funny

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
It's also

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
It goes all the way

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Around the bat

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I remember about that Batman that I made

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Is my dear girlfriend at the time

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Robin Roth

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Very lovely and talented

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Who was my roommate

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And she volunteered to

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
She

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Because one of the scenes

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
It was a dark look into Batman's life

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And he was

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
At one point he's

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
He's

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
He has

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
It just cuts to him in bed

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
With his girlfriend

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Wearing the Batman mask

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
And he's saying to his girlfriend

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Who is naked

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Get up on your knees

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I want to kiss you while I jerk off

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
And it's just supposed to be

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Creepy and sad and lonely

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Because even when he's with someone

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
He's alone

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
But she's

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Like I remember

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I set up the camera on a tripod

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
And like we got into frame

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
And like Robin's

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Nipples were

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Out of frame

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
On the viewfinder

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Like these are the early days

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Of digital video

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I remember just like the kind of

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Over scan

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Like I didn't know all the terminology

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I remember like when the video

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Went online it was like

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
No her nipples are well in frame

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Like it's just

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Just my topless girlfriend

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Giving me a hand job

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Anyway I don't know

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
The early

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Those are the days

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
And then 9-11 happened

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And everyone

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Everything changed

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Even though it's 9-13 now

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
So we missed it

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Am I

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
No Jeff

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
We'll never miss it

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
You're right Dan

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
You know what

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
It's 9-11 in our hearts

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
In mine

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I made a Batman

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
And I asked Derek

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
To be my villain in it

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And this character was called

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Pussy Magnet

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And he had a

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I made him a necklace

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
That was like a magnet

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
With the word pussy

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And we showed up at your dojo

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And you're like Jeff

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Like I can do some karate moves

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
To kick start my heart

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I think with Motley Crue

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And you're like

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I pulled my groin

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
On a show

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
And so I can't really do it

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
If you can never see this

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
You're doing giant flying

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Kicks and everything

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Like you played so hard

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
While hurt

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It's amazing

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
But that's part of your thing

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
It's because I love you

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Hey Derek

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Yeah

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
So when I met you

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Like you were

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I mean like

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Like you

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I always say

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I don't know if it's offensive to you

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
But because I'm trying to create

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
An image in people's head

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Like you looked

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Like the dude from Powder

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Like that when I

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
The first time I ever met you

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Like because it's amazing

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
When you meet somebody

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Who's all like

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Who's jacked up

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
And looks good

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
It's like it's hard to imagine

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
That they ever actually bothered

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
To just like transform themselves

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Without permission

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
But you could have easily

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Just been a dude

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
In a trench coat

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Just hanging out

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
At a campus behind a tree

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And just like using psychic powers

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
To you know

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
To get back at people

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
But instead you went

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
You went this route

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
And one of my questions

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Is like

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Can you remember that point in your life

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
When you like

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Where you went from

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Just what God had dealt you

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
To like

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Deciding to

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Like

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Like just do stuff

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Like

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Did you get fit

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Yeah

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Like what was the threshold

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
What pushed you across that threshold

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Well it was well

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
When I grew up in Bakersfield

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
In California

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
And I grew up

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Like I love

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
When it wasn't cool

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It was like comic book

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Sci-fi, horror

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I got into acting

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Because the Dungeons and Dragons

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Going like

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Oh man

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I want to do this someday professionally

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
How do I do that

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Oh an actor? Perfect

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
But I also grew up as a different kid

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Because I had the alopecia

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
And so what alopecia is

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
For people don't know

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Is when your body rejects your hair

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Just

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
I've had it my entire life

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Which is recently

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Like the last four years

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I could grow a goatee

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
For some reason

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Yeah I know

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Which is bizarre

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I was like liar

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Look at his facial hair

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
No way

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Bull crap

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
But it was weird also going to

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Your friends who are an adult male

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
And going like

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Hey how do you

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
At 40 plus

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Do you do this

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Has that stopped recently

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I don't remember the last time

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
No no still

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I keep shaving it for shows

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Sometimes I grow up

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
So all of a sudden there's this goatee

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Out of nowhere

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Yeah

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Okay

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
We'll talk about that in a second

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Yeah but no

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I got to the point

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I moved to LA to do acting and comedy

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
And it's actually

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Jeff was the one who turned me on

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
To go into this class

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
With Sam Christensen

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Where all of you guys were going to class

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And I joined him with everybody

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Doing the Sam Christensen class

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Me and Marco from Die Hard

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Yes

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Yes

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
And that class

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I learned about

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Like Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
It's kind of an amalgamation

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Of the two put together

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
And I learned about

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
My essences

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
When I give out as a human being

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I went wait a second

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
If I worked out

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I could be like the big bad guy

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
In TV and film

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Everyone's like

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Oh you like the jock in school

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Like you know you can do

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Like you're the super thick guy

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I go no

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I could like

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I was the kid you know

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Like getting picked on

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Like maybe do a pull up

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Or whatever

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
And that was about it

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Wait so what did you learn

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
In Sam's class

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
You were in Sam's class

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
When you were still scrawny

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Yeah

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
For lack of a better word

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
What were you hearing

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
From Sam's class

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
That made you think

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
If you got jacked up

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
What were you hearing

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Well Sam's really nice

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Because he brings me up

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
To other students

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Where he talks about

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
You find out

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
What your essences are

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Like when you walk into a room

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
What you give off to people

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
If you're just quiet

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
And just like

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
What they're

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Who they are

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Like in the old days

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
What we used to do

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Is go to like the airport

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
And like for example

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Hypothetically we go there

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Like Dan was down in the corner

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And I have a list

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Of adjectives on a piece of paper

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
And I would walk around to strangers

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
And go hey my friend

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Dan Harmon

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
We're in an acting class together

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
That guy over there

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Yeah yeah

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Can you mark any adjective

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
You think applies to Dan

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Just by looking at him

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Without him saying anything

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
And after about a hundred of these

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Or so you start seeing

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
The same patterns

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Like some of the same words

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Repeat over and over again

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I literally did that exercise

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And you think like

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Oh this is horseshit

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
You take him home and go

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Why do

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
It's an international terminal

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
So a lot of these people

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Are just like from Poland

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
And it's like

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Why does everyone think I'm sarcastic

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Everyone thinks I'm sarcastic

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
You're standing like 50 feet away

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
And you're standing there neutral

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I check off things that apply

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
To this person and everybody agrees

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I got sarcastic, lazy, smart

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
That's it

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
That's all I remember

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I'm like how do you know I'm lazy

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Like I'm sarcastic

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
The thing is like

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
They might all be wrong

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
About whether or not you're lazy

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
You might not be lazy

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Because you're a workaholic

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I don't think of you as a lazy person

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
But strangers all

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Rob does

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Unanimously agree

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Who?

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Rob

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Makes a lot of comments about it

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I went with a guy

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Who looked like Charles Bronson

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Who was this tough dude

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
With a mustache

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
And I would go like

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
People were like

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
This is back in the days

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Where you could walk into the terminal

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Before a flight

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Before you had to go through security

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
You could be at the gate

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Without going through security

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And so you'd say

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
See that guy over there

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
We're in an iPhone class

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Your flight is delayed

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
If you got nothing better to do

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Check off what you think

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Applies to this person

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
And people love it

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Because you get to

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Because there's not a lot of shit

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
To do at the airport

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Especially this is before 9-11

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
And before the massive amount of

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
This is before Candy Crush

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
This is before words with friends

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
This is before people had shit to do

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I get to pass judgment on a stranger

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
With no contact lenses

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
It's hilarious

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
And I say also

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
If you want to write things down

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Extra things at the bottom

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
To that too

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And the thing is

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
They all said the same shit

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
So we got 50

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Like Sam Christensen said

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Like do five if you trust me

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Do 500 if you don't

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Like the thing is

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
It's going to be the same information

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
No matter what

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Like everyone's going to agree

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
That

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Remember Schrab

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Remember the weekend intensive

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
And you're not supposed to tell anybody

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
What's on your cards

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Because then you do an intensive version

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Where your student

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Your fellow students

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Are writing shit down

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
During exercises

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Schrab is all sullen

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
He's mad

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
We were walking down the sidewalk

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Out of the thing

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And I was like

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Man this is fucking great

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Because I had like

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Looked at my cards

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And you looked at yours

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And you're not supposed to talk to each other

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
At lunch about your cards

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
And

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Rob said

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Rob's bummed out

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And I said

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
What's going on man

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
You're not having a good time

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
He's like

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I don't know man

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
And I'm like

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
What is it

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
It's like

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Someone said

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I look like C-3PO

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:29.000
I'm not C-3PO

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
He was like

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Moving his

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Like

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
The best

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I was like

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Are you doing a bit

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Are you doing a bit

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I wasn't

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
No I'm not

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I'm not C-3PO

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I wasn't

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I only speak

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
5 million languages

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
But okay

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
So Derek

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
So in that case

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Hang on

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
The guy I went to the airport with

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
This kind of tough Charles Bronson looking dude

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
We got in the car

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
And I got teamed up with him

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I didn't really want to be

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
This guy's partner

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Turned out to be the most informative thing

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
In the world

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Because we got in the car

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
And he's looking through the stuff

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
And he's like

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
He's going through his

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Everything's like

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Why does everybody say suspicious

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Like

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Dude

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
You're suspect

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Like

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
You're suspicious of them

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I'm suspicious of you

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And also the same guy

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Actually got up

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
And he's like

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Why do people keep saying

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
I'm loud

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And walked out

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And watching other people

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Reject their shit

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Was amazing

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
But Rob like

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I know I had one that made me cry

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Like I was like

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Oh that's fucking exactly

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
How you say that thing

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
And you had one

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
That I loved

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
It's

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Last puppy at the pound

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Right

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
It's amazing

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
But also because you want

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
You root for the last puppy at the pound

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Like he's the cute one

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Yeah

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And the last puppy at the pound

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Manipulates people

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
What was your breakthrough on Dan?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Mine was a mud monster on shore leave

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Which I personally find

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Because it's like

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
I'm a mud

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I'm from the fucking shitty slimy world

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
But I'm on vacation

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I like

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I like clean soft frilly

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Like I like the real world

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I love it

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I just don't belong in it

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
So I'm just like

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
That's fucking awesome

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
You're so clean

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
You know that's why I love Hugh Jackman

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
That's why I was like

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
When we worked with him

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I'm like I fucking love that guy

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
That's why I love

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I love fucking handsome pretty things

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I love clean

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
But I'm never gonna be

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I'm on shore leave

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
But I don't want to hang out

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
It's like when a LA person

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Goes to Portland

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And they keep apologizing

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
For it being overcast

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I was like

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Motherfucker, why do you think I came here?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I live in a desert

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
That's me with mud

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Like I'm a mud monster

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
On shore leave

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
What was yours, Jarrett?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
My main one?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Yeah

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
My main one was I've been many places

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
But I've never forgotten where I've come from

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
So you started lifting weights?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Yeah

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
What was it?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I had like a lot of like

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
What was it?

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I have this gentle tough guy thing

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Working like a Swiss watch

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
And I had another one

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Where it was like a superhero

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And search a superhero

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
When for meaningful exchange of superpowers

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And so there's a lot of comic booky type things

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And I'm like, wait, if I worked out

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I could be the same bad guy

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
You're getting these things

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
You felt like you were like a dexter in Space Ace

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
But you weren't Space Ace yet

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
No, my god, that's a reference

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Applies never

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Yeah, absolutely

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
That's amazing

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Don Bluth laser disc game

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
A Space Ace reference

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
When did I become the guy that's like

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I made a reference

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
When I just cast on this ice floe

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Could we apply Sam Christensen's knowledge

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
On Spencer and give him an essence?

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Ooh, that's a good one

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Spencer's essence is

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I am taking over your ship

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
And sailing it into

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Cock Harbor

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I am a Viking of Pussy

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
No, I don't

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
It's a fun place

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Let's see, Spencer's essence is

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
This is weird, right?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
That's one of them?

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
The thing about this class

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
It's amazing, Drew Carey

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I took it a long time ago

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And I told Drew about it

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
And Drew's famous

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
And we were taking a road trip together

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And he's like, I want to know who I am

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
The whole point is that

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
There's things that people, strangers, friends

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Instantly agree about you

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Whether they're right or wrong

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
They all go like

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
If you look at you and go like

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Do you like to swim

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Or do you hate getting your hair wet?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
They would all agree or disagree on that

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
But it would be unanimous

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
You might be an Olympic swimmer

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
But they might go no

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
She doesn't like to get her hair wet

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Because this is an essence about you

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I'm just making off the top of my head

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It's this thing like

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
You find out all the things you wish

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
People thought about you

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Maybe they don't

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Also some things that you wish

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Like, I hope people think of this

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
They do think that

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
The big thing is

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
That everything that sticks out about you

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
When you're six years old

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Is the same forever

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Everyone notices everything that's special about you

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
It doesn't have to be who you are

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
It's the way you stick out

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
It's the edges that you have

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
It doesn't have to be a glamorous

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
It's not always like

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
We're raised on myths like the ugly duckling

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And Rudolph and things where

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
We get that concept that

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Oh, maybe the thing that you think is ugly

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Will make you beautiful

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
But that still enforces the idea

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Of utility and beauty

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
The more important thing to realize

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Is that when you're on the playground

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
You're differently shaped

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Than everyone around you

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000
And your early experiences

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
With what makes you different

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Are usually negative experiences

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Because the people around you

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
They're the things that stick out

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
They're practicing being a society

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Which is like water

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Which erodes away at rough edges

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
So all of our early experiences

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Hearing things about ourselves

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Are experiences of crowds gathering

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Around us and going

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Nanny nanny panty panty

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I'm not a panty panty

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And it only means something to us

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
It's something that they figured out

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
They fucking zeroed in on it

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
And it might even just be

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
The fact that you hate attention

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
That's for a lot of people

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And then they fucking hone in

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And a lot of us who are destined

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
For interesting things

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Or just hard things

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
That's when we have to practice

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Being special, whether we like it or not

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And they get to practice being a society

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Whether they like it or not

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
What was amazing in the class

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
There was women in my class

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Like young or middle-aged women

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
That they have to find out

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
How the world thinks of them as pretty

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Or beautiful

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And there was a couple of girls

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
That were really beautiful

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
And the way that the world thinks

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Like the way they describe their beauty

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Is really hard for them to hear

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Because they've been tortured by that

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Since they were little girls

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
And so for them to own the fact

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
That there was...

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I won't say her name

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Because she's on TV and you all know her

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
She's one Emmys and shit

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
She was in the class

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
She's a Latina

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Amy Esperanza

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Yes, it was Amy Esperanza

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
People in the class

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Secretly write down ways

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
To describe things about people

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
And they kept saying hot tamale

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
She's like, I'm not a hot tamale

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
But it's like Sam's like

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
You're a hot tamale

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
What do you like or not?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
They're racist but...

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I've heard that since I was a little girl

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
You're going to hear that till you die

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Catherine Hepburn when she was...

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
How old was she when Philadelphia Story came out?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
18, 19, very young

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
All the reviews called her feisty

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Everyone said she's feisty

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
She's feisty

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Then when she's whatever, 70

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Or whatever she was on Golden Pond

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Crusty

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
When you're older

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
They call you crusty

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
She was in essence of defiance

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
When you're a defiant 18-year-old woman

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
You're feisty

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
When you're defiant 70-year-old woman

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
You're crusty

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Flavor becomes like

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Hey, who poisoned my food?

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
But what they're talking about is

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Catherine Hepburn's essence is

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
She never needed men

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
It was a complete defiance of masculinity

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
We have different names for that

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
When you're young and when you're old

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
One of the things he had us do

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
He said, go home, grab your yearbooks

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I don't even know if you kids do the yearbook thing anymore

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
That was the last time anyone was going to say shit to you

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
They would write all this shit in your yearbook

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Also, all your love letters

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
We would pass loose leaf love letters

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I would keep them all

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Our generation, we'd have boxes of them

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
He said, go home, grab the notes

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
From the girls in your high school

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
When they started, when things were going good

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
When they liked you

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And then go all the way through

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
When they have a problem with you

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And look at the fact that

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
There's just two different words

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
For what makes you who you are

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And when they're hot for you

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
You're capricious

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
And when they are dumping you

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Your fucking scatterbrains

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
For me, all my yearbook stuff

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
There's different neighborhoods of things

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
There's a way to describe how you're attractive

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Or how you're funny

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Or how you're smart

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Or how you're lonely

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Or how you're weird

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Or how you're fucked up

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
We have these neighborhoods of these

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Different qualities of ourselves

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
One of mine is, if you like me

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Confident, poised

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
If you don't like me

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Cocky, arrogant

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Like a piece of shit

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
This piece of shit just thrown in

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
That's like the cheese on the cheese fries

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Piece of shit could go on anything

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
For me, the one that blew my mind

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Sam's like, alright, of course

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
The one that blew my mind

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
We're trying to figure out

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Sam's like, there's a way to describe the fact

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
It's not enough to say, Jeff, that you're cocky

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Because you are cocky

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
But also, you're not just arrogant

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Also, you're not just poised

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
You're not just self-confident

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
There's a way to describe it

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
You also have a huge cock

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Thank you

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
He asked me about that

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
For coming to this class

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
So anyway, I'm fucking Sam Prestige

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
I'm gonna write you a check right now

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
For taking this class

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
But so he has these books of slang

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
And you go to the OED and all this stuff

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
You're trying to find the perfect way to word things

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
And he wrote it down and he goes, Jeff, he goes

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I think you're gonna like this

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I don't think anybody else in the world would

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I think that you might actually agree with this

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
And like this description of that neighborhood of stuff

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
And it was, he wrote it down in a piece of paper

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And gave it to me

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
And I like hit this desk and started crying

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I was like, exactly

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And it was not conceded, just convinced

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
I said, yeah, I don't think I'm better than you

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
I know I am

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Only a dick would think it was better than you

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I just am

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Let's move on

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I could be a great guy

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
You can laugh at me like, oh, yeah

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I'm a prick, but there's a charm to that prickiness

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And there's a thing

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000
No, we always circle that

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Because it's like there's some people that turn you off

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000
With their confidence

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Because it's like, oh, that dick

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And then it's like some people rise

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
They go, somebody strata up that they're like

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Oh, yeah, I got nothing to worry about

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
So let me take you out on the dance floor

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
I give you a twirl

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Like, oh, yeah, I'm not battling those dragons

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
So let me share my wealth with you

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
There was a girl in my class who is a great actor, Silas

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
And she's amazing

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
And also, again, you would know who she was

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
She's the one that turned me on to the class

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Gina Davis

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Huh?

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Gina Davis

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Judy Dench

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
And there was one essence that she could never agree on

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
And we all in the class knew exactly what it was

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
And it was impossible

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And she would never figure out the last one

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
And we'd all just say to her, you're impossible

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000
You're impossible

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
And that doesn't mean bad

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Like, impossible is amazing

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Because like, there's no pleasing you

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
But also like, you're the most important person to try to please

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Like, you're just beyond pleasing

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Oh, she ended up marrying Tom Cruise

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Judy Dench

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
There was a girl in the class

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And she stormed out and she goes, hard to handle

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
She was German, she's hard to handle, fuck this class

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I'm not C-3PO

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Also, Rob, you have a good one that I love

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
It's Little Green Man

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Little Green Man, yeah

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I love that one

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Little Green Man

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Because you are from outer space

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000
And in an awesome way

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
And that's the C-3PO essence too

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
I guess

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Yeah, it's not Boba Fett

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Jen, one of your essences that I love is

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Unspeakable Sadness

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Right?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
It's unspeakable

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
That's why I text you

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Try to help you through that sadness

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Without speaking

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
No, no, no, it's uncomfortable

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
So I text you

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
And you know, even though you don't text back, I hear you

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
It's okay

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I remember one of the cards from that class

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
That somebody wrote that led to that

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Being one of my essences

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Which is what you get from this class

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And this really, really like

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
It triggered me

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
It's weird when you hear the shit that's like

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
What the fuck?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Like I, you know, in the class

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
You do monologue, like Sam goes

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Tell us about an animal that changed your life

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Oh boy

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
And you'll talk for three minutes

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
And the other student scribble

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
He gives the students an exercise

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
It goes, I want you to compare Dan to

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
A weather phenomenon on your card

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
He just like gives you specific instructions

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
To get you out of your head

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
But like, and sometimes he goes like

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Free anything, like no category

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Dan, talk about a celebrity you hate

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Or whatever

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Talk for a while

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And then I got my cards

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And one of them just said

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Talk, talk, talk, wounded

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Whoa

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
My favorite

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
When I went to the airport

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I'm getting no likey

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Still gets me

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
When I went to the airport

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
There was a bunch of, there's a big like

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
A bunch of like middle aged

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Like maybe like 30s, 40s, 50s black women

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
That were all traveling together as a family

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
The worst

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Oh, oh I thought that's what you were going

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
And so

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
My Charles, my Charles Bronson guy

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Like he's like

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
He's like

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
He's like

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
He's like

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
He's like

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
My Charles Bronson guy

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Like you also asked

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Like you said

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Also if you want to just freestyle

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And write shit on your own

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
At the bottom of it

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
And somebody wrote

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And I love this one

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
And she goes

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
That white boy crazy

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Alright

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I was just standing there

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Alright

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Well, let me in

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Spencer or like

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
That white boy crazy

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
We said

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Oh, like Drew Carey

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
So we were in the car

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And he's like

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
I want to know who I am

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
And he went and took the class

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
And he was

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
He was still

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Like the Drew Carey show was still happening

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
That was crazy

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Someone wrote

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
The Price is Right

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
He hadn't

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
When he

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
That was his essence

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I saw Drew

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
And then he went to the show

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
And he was like

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I want to go see

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I want to go see a Greg Phrupp's comedy show

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
And Drew is there

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
And he goes

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Thank you

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Alright

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
That's a hair trigger youp

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
That's a Phrupp youp

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Phrupp youp

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
I'm Phrupp youp

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Can I get a Phrupp youp?

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
This is hilarious

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
I saw for sure

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
He was doing it a bit

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
But he wasn't

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I saw Drew at a gig

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And he goes

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Hey man, so

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
It's got called

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
My Les Moonves

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000
From CBS

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
And they're offering me

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
To be in

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Like the new host of Price is Right

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
I'm like

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Are you going to do it?

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
And he goes

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I guess if the money's good enough

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I was like

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
No, if the price is right

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
It's like

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
If the money's good enough

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
If they mean my quote

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Come on forward

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
That was your one chance

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
That was your one chance

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
If the money's good enough

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I'm like

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I looked at him like

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Are you fucking with me right now?

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
So Drew went and took the class

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
And he then sent everybody he knew

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Like all the people in the Drew Carey set

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
He paid for people to go

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
To take Sam Christensen's class

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000
You must do it

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Even if you're not an actor

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
It's really great

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Like soft knowledge stuff

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
It really does liberate you

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
In terms of like

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Agreeing with the fact

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
That the world knows who you are

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Whether you like it or not

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And also

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
There's some stuff that you think you are

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
That you're just fucking not

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And like

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
That you learned

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
And there's a lot of stuff

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
That people are always going to think you are

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
And fucking get over it

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Like people think that I don't like them

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
And like now

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
At this stage

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
They're right

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
But

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I told Sam

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
We had had back in the old days

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Like you would talk to Sam

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
And he's like Jeff

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
He's like

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
You're a really loyal guy

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Like you're loyal to your friends

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Like you will stick with your friends

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
No matter what

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
You're a loyal person

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
He goes

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000
But that's not one of your essences

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
You don't walk in a room

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
And go

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Oh this dude's true blue

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Like he will always stick with me

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
You don't walk in the room

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Looking like that

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
That's something that

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
You know after meeting you

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
But that's not

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000
That's not an essence of yours

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So get over that one

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
So Drew went

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And what I love about Drew

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
One of his was

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
And one that really set Drew

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Carry free

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Which is amazing

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000
And he was so happy to learn this

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
One of his essences is

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
I'm doing the best I can

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
With what I've got

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
And he's like

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
And I'm a millionaire

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
He goes

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000
But I'm just still trying

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
The best I can

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
That's exactly who he is

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
You could say that

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
That's a phrase you can say

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
When you want to do an impression

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Of Drew Carry

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I'm doing the best I can with what I've got

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Am I allowed to know that

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
About myself?

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
It's like

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Look at what I have

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Like I can't say that

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
He's like

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
No it doesn't matter what you think

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
It's exactly what everybody does

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Oh sorry

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I'm done

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000
See

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I'm bad at this

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I'm bad at this

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Talk talk talk wounded

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000
So Derek

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000
You're a muscle man

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Are you going to hit me like my dad?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Dad

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
When you're physically fit

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Like all I've ever known is

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
I look in the mirror and I go

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Alright

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
That's a sea otter

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
That's a baby

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Like

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
And that's how I came out of the womb

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And I've never done any exercise

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
And I'm like

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Still look like a baby

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
And then like

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
If I start to look like a fat baby

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Then I'm like

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
I kind of figure something out

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
And then I'm like

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Okay I look like a baby again

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
But then other people are like

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
And then they look like

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Like

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
G.I. Joe

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Don't

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Black ops

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I gotta go

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I said

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Is that your ringtone?

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000
When you have to do wet work

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
It's like

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000
It's not what you think

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
It's not discreet

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000
It's like it's the whole room

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
You're in an opera house

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I was like

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And then it's like

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
And the opera singer's like

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
He's checking his phone

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And you're like

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Hiding in plain sight

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And you break everyone's neck

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
In the opera house

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Or just in your row

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Go to sleep

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Go to sleep

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Go to sleep

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
This is

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Like

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
When you're fit

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
When you're made of muscle

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
When you look good

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
When you're a

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:21.000
When you're a hot piece of action

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
What

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Like

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
So like

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
What

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
I'm so being judged by everybody

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Right now

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I'm like

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
I don't know

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Dan's talking a little much

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
What's the terror

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
How do you

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
What do you

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
We're all gonna have to be

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
80

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
If we're lucky

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000
What do you

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
How do you

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
What's my go to

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Once my body falls apart

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Yeah

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
What do you

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Is there a day that you

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Stop

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Like and then

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Are you terrified of that

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Like oh shit

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
What

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Like now if I fucking

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Skip Monday

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
No honestly

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
A lot of the training and whatnot

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Is for my job

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
My job is to tell stories

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I love stories

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And I

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
You've told my mom when I was younger

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I don't need to be rich or famous

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
I wanna play with my friends

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
And just make a living

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
And it's been amazing

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
No

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
No

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
No

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000
What does this mean

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000
No

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
When you get up to discipline

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
For writing and whatnot

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Like you work on writing

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I work on

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I know what sells

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000
But also

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000
My backup

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000
I also have a brain

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
So like create things

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
And

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Okay yeah

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Okay

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Now I feel like a dick

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Oh no no no

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Wasn't trying to be that way

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000
No cause I'm just wondering

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Cause I'm like every day

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
I look in the mirror

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I try not to

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
I try as hard as I can

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Not to

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
But I like a look in the mirror

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000
And I'm like

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Okay like an A cup

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
B cup

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Getting a B cup

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Like I make these like judgements

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Like ah fuck

I mean you

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Like you have a regimen

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Schrabs

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
One of them too

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Like like like

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000
You got

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000
You're in the zone

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Like you're doing

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
You're healthy

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
And so then you look in the mirror

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000
And then like

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
I'm just wondering

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Like do you

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Like

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Isn't there like a

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Like a

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Dust bowl behind you

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Like

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Like

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
How does that

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
How does the human body work

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I don't know

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
How does that work

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Like like

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Do you have to be

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
When you go to the gym

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Are there

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
70 year old dudes

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000
That are like

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Just

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Like

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Like keeping it up

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
A lot of

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Is that that whole

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Use it or lose it

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Mentality

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
But also after you get past

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
A certain age

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Your growth homeroom

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Stops producing as much

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000
As it used to

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
And so your

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Body starts to die

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Basically

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Where it starts to

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Be agile

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
As it used to be

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000
But if you just keep

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
That

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
I always call that

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Spoonful of sugar

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Where it's like

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Oh man

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
If I do this

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
I'll feel good

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
And I can do

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
What else

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I want to do

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
During the day

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
And also it helps me

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000
With my job

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000
To sell what my product is

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Is being that big bad guy

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I meet people

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Left and right

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Going

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Oh my god

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
I saw you in this

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Or that

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
And you're a murderer

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000
And you scare the crap out of me

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
But I meet you in person

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
You're a human being

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
I'm like

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
What

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
When does

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
What age does your body die

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
What age

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
We need to know

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
It's usually like the

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
From 44 things

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Start to decline

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Okay so I'm 43

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
So

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
So

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
So I can eat

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Pringles for breakfast

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
For another year

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And then it just

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Start working out

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000
And then

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000
No

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
No

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
The awesome for that

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Is like

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
My

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I gotta go kill myself

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
No

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
It's kind of like

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000
If you

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Oh no

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Oh

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
What

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Okay

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Well that day

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
We were joining him

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
That's awesome

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
No

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Like

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Oh no

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
What

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Rob is now

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
For the home audience

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Pretending to

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Murder himself

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Behind the glass

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Rob killed himself

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
With

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000
A gun loaded

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
With stolen focus

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
It's

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
It's something

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Prisoners use

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
When they're deprived of

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
No as long as you keep using

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Your muscle

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I mean

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Muscles in general

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Like with you with writing

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
That you're using your brain

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Whatever you use

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
It'll stay active

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
In my opinion

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I hope

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
So I mean

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Yeah

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
I'm trying to think of

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Just the most

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Crass way to

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Phrase the thing

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Is it like

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Like

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Like

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Obviously

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.000
If I keep doing

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
What I'm doing

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I'm going to

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Die sooner

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
And look worse

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
The whole time

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
And it'll

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And I'll never

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Like the longer I wait

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
The harder it will be

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000
For me to start

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Just like

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Being healthy

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
And I'm just wondering

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
On the other

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
There's this other railroad track

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Where I see you

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
One of my friends

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
That I've known for decades

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I'm going like

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Hey

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
And I'm just wondering

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Like

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
What does your railroad track

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Look like

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Like what are the hazards

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Like what are you

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Worried about

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Like

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Do you fit people

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Like

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Is there anything

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Is there ever a point

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Where the tool

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Starts using you

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Is there ever

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
And I think

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Shamelessly

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I kind of

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
I guess

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Want to hear

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Like yeah

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Oh yeah

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
It's the worst

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
There it is

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I don't

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Like I don't want to

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Do it

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
But it's also my job

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.000
So I have to

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Like if I'm not working somewhere

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I gotta

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Okay clock into the gym

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
And train

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
But you

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
You have to stay up on

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Like anything in life

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000
But you're

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000
You're getting that

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I'm not sure

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
What I'm getting at

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I'm

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Part of it is

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Like this

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Midwestern thing

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Of like the

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
The principle

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Was always a

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Former wrestling coach

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
And then he'd have

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
This big giant

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Gut

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Kids would whisper

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Into each other

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
And go

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Dude

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
That was all muscle

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
And muscle turns

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
To fat

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
If you stop

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Using it

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
So you're saying

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Like how people

01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Identify with things

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
So they identify

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000
That's who I am

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
I'm talking about

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000
What is the

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I'm actually talking

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Purely physiologically

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Not like

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000
What we should

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Wear our value system

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I'm talking about

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Actually like

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
How does that

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Shit work

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Like if you

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
If you're fucking

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Like if you

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Look awesome

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
And are like

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Doing like

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Like putting

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
All that work into it

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Is there a

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Is there a

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Is there a

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Fucking like

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Like is there

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
An anxiety to

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000
That sets in

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Where it's like

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Oh shit

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Like

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Like

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Now I'll look

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Like Dan Harmon

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
If I stop tomorrow

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I don't know

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
What I'm trying to add

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
If you're really muscle bound

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
You have to be careful

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Like at some point

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
That muscle can

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Turn to fat

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Or can turn to that

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
That big

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
X football coach

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Belly

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
That's really hard

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Like a watermelon

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
That kind of stuff

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Is that just something fat

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
People say

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
To make themselves feel better

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Or is that

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000
That idea that

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Like muscle turns

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
To fat

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Kind of thing

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000
It doesn't

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000
It doesn't

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
You'll definitely lose it

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Spencer, do you exercise at all?

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
No

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Not a bit?

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Nothing?

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
No, of course not

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
You seem like

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Since I've known you

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Which is now what

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Three, four years?

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
How long, how long?

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Three, four years

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Like you maintain a certain

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Like steady physique

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Like you don't like

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Flexuate

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
I gain weight

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Yes, you can

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Flexuate

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
I think for me like

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Like

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
If I ate what I wanted to

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Like my favorite thing in the world

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Is like a 4 a.m. burrito

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
It's the greatest thing in the world

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Like just like

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Just eat a bunch of bullshit

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Like after you drink all night long

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
But he's vegetarian

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
He means

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
No, no, no

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Go to Benito's tacos

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000
And eat there

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Just a shit-ass burrito

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
And like

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Until I turned 30

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I could never gain a pound

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Then one day

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
I was like

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Oh, fuck, I got a big-ass belly

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I look like

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Senator Cartgage

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
From Homestyle Runner

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Look good

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Tall and skinny with a giant belly

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I'm like

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
This is fucking

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Like I have to curb that shit

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Here's your secret

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
But you won't do this

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Because you're not vain like I am

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Buy suits that you love

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000
And if you can't fit in them

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Stop it

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Stop doing what you're doing

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Get back in the suits

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Don't let them out

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Like fucking

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Like I buy suits that I fit into

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
And if I can't fit in them

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Then exercise and diet

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Get it back on track

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000
That's visualizing your goals

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000
And where you want to be

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000
It's precisely

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Makes it concrete

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
And more attainable that way

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Also, as you get older

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
I got to say it

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Sounds dumb

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Yoga

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Oh, absolutely

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Absolutely

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Because you need flexibility

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
And agility

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
And your joints

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
And stuff like that

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Like when you do that stuff

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
You can spring up and down

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Staircases like a gazelle

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000
But otherwise

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Your joints are creaking

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Like an old

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
It's like a ratchet trap

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
If you're your whole life

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000
You're walking

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
You're not even working out

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000
And just doing normal activity

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Everything is cranked and cranked

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Every time you engage that muscle

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
And if you don't undo that

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000
You start getting that

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Be that old person hunch

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000
And whatnot

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000
It's not good for the body

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000
It hurts

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Damn it

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Oh, man

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
But this is opening my eyes to something

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
What's with yoga pants?

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Because the

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000
That seems like a recent thing

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And it's like

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
I question it

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
No, I don't

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
I think I support yoga pants

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
In every possible way

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
When did that come about?

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
That seems to be

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Like

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Because I keep hearing conflicting reports

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
I think I think

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
You knew lemon came along

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
And made everybody wear yoga pants

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
I guess I just

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Yeah, I asked my girlfriends

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
That's what it is

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
It's like money flooded into

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
An area of fashion slash exercise

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000
And so this new form of pants

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Was developed

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Because I never had to

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I'm like, wait a minute

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.000
What?

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
There's pants that

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
They

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Like yoga pants

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
They

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Stretch

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
They

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000
They look like stockings

01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Well, no, they

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000
They also

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
They make your ass look good

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Right?

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Yeah

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
But they're also comfortable

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
So previously

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
There was a dichotomy of things

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
That made you look good

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Versus things that were comfortable

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
But this is the thing that's comfortable

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
That makes your ass look good

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
It's like a perfect storm

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Like

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Why didn't they

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
What technology did they

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
What did they find out in space

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
That led them to Houston

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
We found a stitch that

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I don't know

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Have you tried stretch jeans yet

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
For men?

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
No, I'm not making a joke

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I swear to God

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I shot this thing in Europe

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
And I tried these pants

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.000
And I went, oh my god

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Wait, these are stretch

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
They're like yoga pants

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
But I'm wearing some right now

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Like checkings?

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000
No, these stretch

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.000
They're like, they're new

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Like Levi's

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
But they're super flexible

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000
That's why I'm not

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Killing my balls trying to

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Get in the ceiling

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
I was like

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Because those look like regular jeans

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
They're not

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
They're flexed

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
They're like four-way flex

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000
All right, well

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Super comfy

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Well, I don't know what else

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
We could possibly cover

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Let's do a Q&A

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Who's got a question

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000
For either a life long

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Cinematic stuntman

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Slash monster

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Slash

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Actor

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Goon actor

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
In the background

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Slash

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Goon actor

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Goon actor

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Yeah, I'm with you Jeff

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Well, what?

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Okay, it's like, all right

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I have a question

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Dave

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Dave Kline has a question

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I believe in the guy Goon

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Prince theory of masculine identity

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
And when you said Goon

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
I think that everyone has a guy

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Who's like kind of a tough guy

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
A Goon who's kind of a fuck-up

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Like weirdo

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
And a prince

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Who's like a piece of royalty

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
And you got all those pieces in you

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
He said you got a little bit of Goon

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
What's your guy part

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
And what's your prince part?

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:58.000
All right, my guy part

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
The macho side of background

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000
And not professionally, but fighting

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000
MMA and what not

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
And training martial arts for a long time

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
My prince part is

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I try to be, that philosophy

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
To be good to everybody

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
And also whatever people are

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
I go and do like horror cons

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I do autograph signings for different fans

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Here and there

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000
And what I love to do

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
It bumps me out on the social media

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I'll see, so often people aren't happy

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
With how they look

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Or how they feel about themselves

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
And I try to empower people

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Going like, man, like

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I grew, I was a different kid, man

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I had no hair

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I was either, people thought I either had cancer

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Or I was a skinhead

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000
You know, growing up when it wasn't cool

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
To be bald and white

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
People were like, oh, that guy's totally white

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Powered like, no, swear to God

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
I'm not

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
But growing up being different

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
And kind of being like a monster out there

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
It's coming back though

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000
It's coming back

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Just randomly, oh yeah

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
We haven't talked about that yet

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
But coming back, I mean

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Being an adult now

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000
And I've got the point I was trying to make

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
The point was I just

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Trying to empower people to go

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Whatever it is that makes you different

01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Step on that gas pedal

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Like, no one is like you

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
And love yourself for who you are

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
And so I love meeting some of these other guys

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Who are like, they see some of my roles

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000
As being like super tough

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Oh, man, I can't wait

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I've been so much fun

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000
I like to go to bar fights

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
And smash people in the face

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And be like, man, right now

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
You're wearing a mask of insecurity

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Because you're trying to be macho

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
There's no reason for that

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
We're all human beings

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Express how you feel and move on

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I meant goon like

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Because there's a villain

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000
There's goons behind them

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
So either a monster

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Or a guy flying out a window on fire

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Or a goon behind somebody

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
He hasn't played Othello yet

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
A question?

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000
It could be a Spencer question

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000
It could be a Rob question

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
It doesn't have to be a Spencer question

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000
What's going on?

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
What happened to you?

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
What did you do?

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
What did you go through?

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000
What?

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Did you just take a huge shit?

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
That couldn't have been a pee

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
No, I didn't go to the bathroom

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.000
And answer some emails

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
He sent some emails

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Answers some emails

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
No, he answered some emails

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000
You're in a show

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
All right

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
This is probably what counts for me

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Q&A

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000
All right, sir

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
I've got a question for Derek

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Derek

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
I know that you've been talking about sense of self

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
And your essence

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000
And you've been playing like the bad guy

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000
But do you ever like have the

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Not ego part of you

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
But just you really want that

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Reading rule kind of deal

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Where you're not Jason

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Where you're all mad

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Yeah

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.000
But you're still yourself

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I should repeat that

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000
And then the next time

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000
I'll do

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
He said

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Do you ever crave playing the lead role?

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
There you go

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I probably missed some of the nuance

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000
No, I've been lucky

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I've done like 85 different

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Like film and TV projects

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
But my mentality is

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Like bouncing back is a bit

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000
To my normal face

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And doing monsters

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000
People sometimes

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000
A tangent of your question

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Are you like

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Does that bother you

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Because some of you are like

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
When you play like Predator

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Or what not

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000
That you look

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000
We can't tell that it's you

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Oh shit, he was classic Predator

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
In the Predators

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.000
He wasn't one of those bullshit Predators

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000
And he was like

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Old school Predator

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000
He was like

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Hey little boy

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Want some candy

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Want some candy

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Want some candy

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
But to answer your question

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.000
As an artist

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Any other artist

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
You want to always outdo yourself

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000
And do better and better

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000
And when I get to ask that question

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000
When it bothers you

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000
When your face is covered

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
For some of your bigger roles

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000
I'm not bothered by that all

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Because my job is to tell

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Story and to service that story

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000
And don't remember me

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Remember the characters

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
When you watch

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
When you watch that

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Sorry

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Thanks Dave

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
When you watch Hansel and Gretel

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Which by the way

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Like B plus

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000
That Hansel and Gretel movie

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Like have you seen it

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
It's a real Goon movie

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
That's going to bounce off of me

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Because I'm picked on too

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:05.000
But when you watch that movie

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Are you like

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Do you have PTSD

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Or do you

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Funny that you bring this up

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Because a fan just sent me a thing

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Because AMC just played it

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.000
For the first time

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000
And they showed like

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Some of the interviews

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Like behind the scenes

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000
And they had a whole segment

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Of me talking about

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000
The Edward character

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
And I literally

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000
I'm watching it

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Because of my arm

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Like I said

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Between my five and six

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I had a herniated disc

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
And my whole arm atrophied

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
And it took about a year

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000
To heal

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000
And I'm going to like

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
These German doctors

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000
And they're giving me

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Multiple spinal injections

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Throughout the week

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000
You're shooting overseas

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
And you're like

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Oh my god my fucking body is

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
I can't move

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000
And then you're at the mercy

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Of what might be

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
The better medicine

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Or worse medicine

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000
You don't know

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000
It's weird

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Also the doctor's name

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Translated to like

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Doctor Creepy

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Or Doctor Sneaky

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.000
And I was in tears

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Going like

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Are you kidding me

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
But also like

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
They lay you down

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.000
I'm getting an injection

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Like this is

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Like Doctor Frankenstein Land

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Everybody's talking in German

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.000
So you know

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000
You're a little

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000
That little bit of like

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Oh Germans and

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Experiments

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
And so I'm like

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Laying there

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And they're like

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Let it go

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Like some like

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Can you take

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000
You know take off this part

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Of your clothes

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000
And there's like a hot nurse

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
There also a blonde

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
You know German

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Like again

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.000
But they would go like

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Oh so Derek

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Oh so Doctor Paul

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Andra

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Your body is

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Yeah okay

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Here it comes

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Like he would say

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Weird things

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I had no idea

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
What the fuck he was saying

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Oh my god

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
And then like

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
And then he was like

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
One, two, three

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
You're like

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Christ the fuck

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Yeah it was

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Yeah but anyway

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000
They answered your question

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Yeah like PTSD

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Like I'm watching it

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
So when you watch that movie

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000
And start cracking my neck

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I'm like

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000
You're not like

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Jeremy Renner's hot

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
You're like

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000
You're like

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Holy shit

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Like you actually

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Like remember

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Like fucking game

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Like when you're watching the

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Are there

01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000
There must be

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
I can't believe

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
That fucking character

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000
That CG

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Which is the

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Must be the worst part

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Is that it's like

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000
That means that it could have been

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Well the

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Are there moments

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.000
When the

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
The character is like emoting

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
And like doing a thing

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000
And you're like

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
That was 50 takes

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Yeah absolutely

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
It's tough

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Cause also as an actor

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000
You have like

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
You know what you want to do

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000
For the scene

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
You've made the characters

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
And spectral motion

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Who made this incredible

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Piece of machinery

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
I feel like a jet fighter

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Pilot

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Where I get to where

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I fly this amazing thing

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
You have to pre-think

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000
What's going on

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
This is my arc in the scene

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Here's the emotion

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000
That's what's happening

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000
And you have to map out

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Cause I couldn't control

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000
My hands

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
And I couldn't control

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
My mouth

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Cause you saw the mouth

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000
But you can't walk around

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000
With the character

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000
The mouth open the whole time

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
So they close it

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000
And so as you're

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Just sitting there

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.000
And cooking

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
You're breathing your own

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Carbon dioxide

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
So you're not getting

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Fresh air

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000
To fuel your muscles

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
And your brain

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
And there are times

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Where I'm just like

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Past

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Yeah yeah

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
The half conscious

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Yeah yeah

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Like I would like

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
To do something

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Do you need some water

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Or something

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Right now it's cool

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Alright

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000
And it's like

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Everyone had that

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Do you need some water

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Or something

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Hey man

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000
It's me

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Jeremy Renner

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
You need some water

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Oh god

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Oh man

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000
I hate this dick

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000
This kid's some water

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Over here

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Man he's

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000
This goom

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
This goom

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Man he's all goom

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Man

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
I hate it when Jeremy

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Renner does his

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Weird barrio accent

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Oh man

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Get this man

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Some water

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Cause he's all milked

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000
And he's breathing

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
His own

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Carbon dioxide

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000
It's because Jeremy

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Renner auditioned

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000
For that part

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000
And got the part of

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Hansel

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
And was offended

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Breathing his own

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000
And I can't

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Operate the whole thing

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Looking through your

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Own mouth

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Breathing your own

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Carbon dioxide

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Oh it's me

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Jeremy Renner

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Do you need some water

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Man

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Breathing on your own

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Carbon dioxide

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Oh it's me

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Jeremy Renner

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Do you need some water

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Man

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Breathing on your own

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Carbon dioxide

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Looking through your own

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Mouth

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
With your

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Disc hurt

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Knitting

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000
All the hurt

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Knitting

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Disc is hurting

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Can we do a

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Knitting

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Can we do a quick commercial

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000
For Jeremy Renner's

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000
New Mexican restaurant

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
And gradually played

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
That goblin thing

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.000
He's breathing out of

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
His own

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
From Hansel and Greta

That was a ZT

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
With a man in a costume

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
And you can look through

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Your own mouth

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
That's Harmon's time of the day

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
That's the worst restaurant

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
It's a Rob's job
