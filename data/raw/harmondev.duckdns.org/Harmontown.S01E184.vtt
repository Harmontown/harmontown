should do that.\n\n00:56.900 --> 00:58.900\nI think it's kind of implied, isn't it?\n\n00:58.900 --> 00:59.900\nIsn't it?\n\n00:59.900 --> 01:00.900\nA little implicit?\n\n01:00.900 --> 01:01.900\nI

notoriety,\n\n01:06.900 --> 01:11.900\notherwise I would be standing on stage and hiding behind a giant Buick-sized...\n\n01:11.900 --> 01:14.900\nHey, I don't come to HUMMING TOWN for the notoriety either.\n\n01:14.900 --> 01:17.900\n[\"HUMMING TOWN\"]\n\n01:17.900 --> 01:19.900\nWhy did you name it HUMMING TOWN?\n\n01:19.900 --> 01:20.900\nI couldn't...\n\n01:20.900 --> 01:21.900\nI'm bad at names.\n\n01:21.900 --> 01:22.900\nLike, I...\n\n01:22.900 --> 01:24.900\nEverything I came up with was taken.\n\n01:24.900 --> 01:28.900\nI wanted to call it Scott Ackerman's...\n\n01:28.900 --> 01:29.900\nPalooza.\n\n01:29.900 --> 01:36.900\nI tried calling it at one point...\n\n01:36.900 --> 01:37.900\nWhat's it?\n\n01:37.900 --> 01:40.900\nKevin Pollock TOWN?\n\n01:40.900 --> 01:42.900\nBut then I was like...\n\n01:42.900 --> 01:46.900\nYou guys are best friends, aren't you?\n\n01:46.900 --> 01:48.900\nI don't like him anymore.\n\n01:48.900 --> 01:50.900\nI don't like Kevin Pollock.\n\n01:50.900 --> 01:51.900\nLet the feud begin.\n\n01:51.900 --> 01:52.900\nAll right.\n\n01:52.900 --> 01:54.900\nSo I got nothing.\n\n01:54.900 --> 01:56.900\nI didn't write anything in my phone.\n\n01:56.900 --> 02:05.900\nThen Dan, I will take it as Comptroller upon myself to tell you that today was a big day in sports.\n\n02:05.900 --> 02:06.900\nOh, oh, oh!\n\n02:06.900 --> 02:08.900\nSo we're going to do an old-fashioned...\n\n02:08.900 --> 02:10.900\nWas it today the Super Bowl?\n\n02:10.900 --> 02:11.900\nYes, it was.\n\n02:11.900 --> 02:15.900\nAnd I was surrounded by guys on the set because I was shooting today,\n\n02:15.900 --> 02:20.900\nand as we all know, everyone in the crew is into football,\n\n02:20.900 --> 02:22.900\nand then the actors aren't,\n\n02:22.900 --> 02:24.900\nbut then the crew was walking around going like,\n\n02:24.900 --> 02:25.900\nDon't tell me!\n\n02:25.900 --> 02:26.900\nDon't shut up!\n\n02:26.900 --> 02:27.900\nDon't tell me!\n\n02:27.900 --> 02:29.900\nBecause they're all DVR-ing the game.\n\n02:29.900 --> 02:30.900\nDid they tell you anything?\n\n02:30.900 --> 02:31.900\nHow much?\n\n02:31.900 --> 02:32.900\nNo.\n\n02:32.900 --> 02:33.900\nI don't know.\n\n02:33.900 --> 02:39.900\nWell, that is time for a sports career!\n\n02:39.900 --> 02:41.900\nThrow balls, throw balls around.\n\n02:41.900 --> 02:43.900\nWhen you throw balls, you're going to get around.\n\n02:43.900 --> 02:45.900\nOh, it's good to throw balls.\n\n02:45.900 --> 02:48.900\nIt's good to invest in your body.\n\n02:48.900 --> 02:54.900\nIt's a good thing to do because everybody knows that's what makes you happy.\n\n02:54.900 --> 02:57.900\nBecause look at life and look at history.\n\n02:57.900 --> 03:03.900\nEveryone that's physically superior always ends up being unexploited and happy.\n\n03:03.900 --> 03:06.900\nAnd rich and in control of other people.\n\n03:06.900 --> 03:08.900\nI'll say, I cut that off.\n\n03:08.900 --> 03:10.900\nOh, wait, it's the other way around.\n\n03:10.900 --> 03:13.900\nShould we start again?\n\n03:13.900 --> 03:23.900\nActually, the more sit-ups you do, the closer you get to being a slave.\n\n03:31.900 --> 03:33.900\nA fate I wouldn't wish on anyone.\n\n03:33.900 --> 03:36.900\nBut hey, if it's going to happen to someone, it might as well be an idiot.\n\n03:36.900 --> 03:38.900\nOur timing is up.\n\n03:38.900 --> 03:43.900\nHey.\n\n03:43.900 --> 03:45.900\nGet to the bottom of this.\n\n03:45.900 --> 03:48.900\nHey, there's Dan Harmon.\n\n03:48.900 --> 03:51.900\nHe's dirty and he's in the corner, minding his own business.\n\n03:51.900 --> 03:55.900\nLet's pick on him because obviously football isn't that fulfilling\n\n03:55.900 --> 03:58.900\nbecause we have free time to pick on people.\n\n03:58.900 --> 03:59.900\nLet's go pick on him.\n\n03:59.900 --> 04:01.900\nWhat do you have to say, Dan?\n\n04:01.900 --> 04:02.900\nWhy don't you throw a football?\n\n04:02.900 --> 04:04.900\nI don't think it's very important.\n\n04:04.900 --> 04:09.900\nI'm not... I don't think it's important.\n\n04:09.900 --> 04:11.900\nWell, we think you're wrong.\n\n04:11.900 --> 04:15.900\nWell, I'm willing to bet my fucking life on it.\n\n04:15.900 --> 04:17.900\nAnd yours.\n\n04:17.900 --> 04:19.900\nWithout moving a muscle.\n\n04:19.900 --> 04:23.900\nWell, we're not willing to risk anything, but we're going to punch you.\n\n04:23.900 --> 04:27.900\nI'll see you in seven years, you piece of shit.\n\n04:27.900 --> 04:29.900\nSeven years later.\n\n04:29.900 --> 04:34.900\nOkay, I'm still a nerd and I don't have any money.\n\n04:34.900 --> 04:36.900\nTen years after that.\n\n04:36.900 --> 04:38.900\nAh-ha, I got you.\n\n04:38.900 --> 04:40.900\nI'm a PA in basic table.\n\n04:40.900 --> 04:43.900\nAll right, I think...\n\n04:43.900 --> 04:45.900\nOkay, great.\n\n04:50.900 --> 04:52.900\nI don't have my iPad, Dan.\n\n04:52.900 --> 04:55.900\nI'm going off the phone now and it's a little harder to operate.\n\n04:55.900 --> 04:58.900\nYou're going to have to deal with a little sloppy or controlling music wise.\n\n04:58.900 --> 05:01.900\nListen, I got drunk today too.\n\n05:01.900 --> 05:03.900\nI was drinking all day today.\n\n05:03.900 --> 05:04.900\nBut you were working.\n\n05:04.900 --> 05:05.900\nI know.\n\n05:05.900 --> 05:07.900\nYou drinking on the set?\n\n05:07.900 --> 05:09.900\nYeah.\n\n05:09.900 --> 05:12.900\nIt's called functional alcoholism.\n\n05:12.900 --> 05:15.900\nThat's my gig, baby.\n\n05:15.900 --> 05:18.900\nBut I am a little softer on the edges, a little sloppy.\n\n05:18.900 --> 05:23.900\nDan, don't deflect from the fact that we are now in sports corner proper.\n\n05:23.900 --> 05:24.900\nOh, shit, shit, shit, shit.\n\n05:24.900 --> 05:25.900\nYes, yes.\n\n05:25.900 --> 05:26.900\nWell, you know what? Do the thing.\n\n05:26.900 --> 05:29.900\nOkay, we're good.\n\n05:29.900 --> 05:31.900\nWhat's in the middle?\n\n05:31.900 --> 05:33.900\nStart from the beginning.\n\n05:33.900 --> 05:34.900\nYeah, but this is off the phone.\n\n05:34.900 --> 05:35.900\nOkay, here we go.\n\n05:35.900 --> 05:36.900\nFrom the top.\n\n05:36.900 --> 05:38.900\nSports corner!\n\n05:38.900 --> 05:40.900\nOh!\n\n05:40.900 --> 05:42.900\nHey, what is going on?\n\n05:42.900 --> 05:47.900\nVonnegut, Picasso, Tom Hanks, who knows who they are?\n\n05:47.900 --> 05:52.900\nUh, hey, but what about that Brett Favre?\n\n05:52.900 --> 06:01.900\nSo Dan, off the top here, let's just come straight out.\n\n06:01.900 --> 06:04.900\nDid you think the best team won today?\n\n06:04.900 --> 06:06.900\nFirst off.\n\n06:06.900 --> 06:11.900\nObviously, Jeff, the beautiful thing about football, and the reason why everyone loves it so much,\n\n06:11.900 --> 06:14.900\nis that the best team always wins.\n\n06:14.900 --> 06:18.900\nThat's the point of football, is it's a metric of worth.\n\n06:18.900 --> 06:24.900\nWe spend our days wandering around the city streets, not knowing if we succeeded or failed.\n\n06:24.900 --> 06:30.900\nAnd then we, only in these arenas can we see, oh, I got a first down.\n\n06:30.900 --> 06:36.900\nI'm a better person than the guy that only got a second down.\n\n06:36.900 --> 06:40.900\nAnd if I get enough first downs, I can get a touchdown.\n\n06:40.900 --> 06:43.900\nAnd then I get a rose bowl.\n\n06:43.900 --> 06:48.900\nAnd if I get three rose bowls, I put them in a super bowl.\n\n06:48.900 --> 06:52.900\nAnd then I really eat all the rose bowls.\n\n06:52.900 --> 06:55.900\nBecause I'm so powerful.\n\n06:55.900 --> 06:57.900\nI'm such a powerful person.\n\n06:57.900 --> 07:00.900\nAre you a coach or a player in this?\n\n07:00.900 --> 07:04.900\nI'm just a general fan of everything athletic.\n\n07:04.900 --> 07:07.900\nI think it's a great way to spend your time.\n\n07:07.900 --> 07:14.900\nAnd when I was in kindergarten, they tried to hold me back for a grade, because I didn't know how to walk on a balance beam.\n\n07:14.900 --> 07:16.900\nWhat?\n\n07:16.900 --> 07:24.900\nAnd you know what, I applaud their scrutiny, because I'm famous for my balance.\n\n07:24.900 --> 07:25.900\nI've always found you.\n\n07:25.900 --> 07:31.900\nNot only am I, but so many are.\n\n07:31.900 --> 07:36.900\nBeethoven, Einstein, Steve Jobs.\n\n07:36.900 --> 07:41.900\nBoy, they're like cats.\n\n07:41.900 --> 07:45.900\nI mean, we're in turmoil as a culture.\n\n07:45.900 --> 07:49.900\nWhere do we fucking cut this shit off and make a moon raker colony?\n\n07:49.900 --> 07:54.900\nBalance.\n\n07:54.900 --> 07:59.900\nSo the Broncos were favored by six points.\n\n07:59.900 --> 08:02.900\nBut who did you think was going to win?\n\n08:02.900 --> 08:04.900\nThe Patriots?\n\n08:04.900 --> 08:07.900\nThe Patriots were already out of it because they had already lost.\n\n08:07.900 --> 08:11.900\nYeah, the guy lost his shoulder.\n\n08:11.900 --> 08:15.900\nAnd then of course there were those rape charges.\n\n08:15.900 --> 08:18.900\nThat's a pretty good guess.\n\n08:18.900 --> 08:21.900\nOn my part.\n\n08:21.900 --> 08:26.900\nYou're talking about the New England Cosby's.\n\n08:26.900 --> 08:28.900\nOkay, so it was the Patriots versus the Broncos.\n\n08:28.900 --> 08:30.900\nNo, no, versus the Panthers.\n\n08:30.900 --> 08:31.900\nPanthers versus Broncos.\n\n08:31.900 --> 08:33.900\nNew England Panthers.\n\n08:33.900 --> 08:34.900\nCarolina Panthers.\n\n08:34.900 --> 08:35.900\nCarolina Panthers.\n\n08:35.900 --> 08:36.900\nWhich Carolina?\n\n08:36.900 --> 08:37.900\nI think North.\n\n08:37.900 --> 08:39.900\nNorth Carolina Panthers.\n\n08:39.900 --> 08:40.900\nAll right.\n\n08:40.900 --> 08:46.900\nOkay, the North Carolina Panthers in full representation of the North Carolina lifestyle.\n\n08:46.900 --> 08:55.900\nAbsolutely separating themselves from that bullshit Southern Carolina by virtue of the Panther.\n\n08:55.900 --> 08:59.900\nTheir state cat.\n\n08:59.900 --> 09:01.900\nI think they did a great job today.\n\n09:01.900 --> 09:04.900\nOkay, let's be honest.\n\n09:04.900 --> 09:07.900\nYou don't care for sports so much, but I know that you do love entertainment.\n\n09:07.900 --> 09:12.900\nYou are known to be quite an arbiter of what is and what is not entertainment.\n\n09:12.900 --> 09:15.900\nI thought the Black Eyed Peas and Sean Penn did a great job.\n\n09:15.900 --> 09:20.900\nYou're closer than you know.\n\n09:20.900 --> 09:29.900\nI was amazed when Gallagher came out with his head had been surgically reattached to Anthony Bourdain.\n\n09:29.900 --> 09:33.900\nThey opened up with, they came out, it started with Coldplay.\n\n09:33.900 --> 09:37.900\nYou know, the most exciting band of all time.\n\n09:37.900 --> 09:48.900\nIs this a tribute to concussions and people who have suffered so much head trauma that Coldplay is more at their speed now.\n\n09:48.900 --> 09:53.900\nThen, I believe it was Bruno Mars and company came out and they're like, they fucking whip ass.\n\n09:53.900 --> 09:59.900\nThere was a bunch of dudes in the same suit and they're doing like Michael Jackson, James Brown moves.\n\n09:59.900 --> 10:03.900\nAnd then Beyonce comes out, but still there's a Coldplay out on stage.\n\n10:03.900 --> 10:05.900\nThere's a Coldplay out on stage?\n\n10:05.900 --> 10:08.900\nBeyonce was like tripping over him.\n\n10:08.900 --> 10:10.900\nOh, the single ladies.\n\n10:10.900 --> 10:12.900\nWhat the fuck, there's a Coldplay.\n\n10:12.900 --> 10:21.900\nI was leaving, I left the game during halftime so I didn't see it, but I heard that there was a thing where Beyonce almost fell over on stage.\n\n10:21.900 --> 10:24.900\nAnd people were already online talking about Beyonce almost wiped out on stage.\n\n10:24.900 --> 10:25.900\nSo I looked at it.\n\n10:25.900 --> 10:27.900\nYes, Beyonce almost wiped out.\n\n10:27.900 --> 10:36.900\nShe's wearing what I can only describe as a leather one piece swimsuit with Michael Jackson braids and epaulets on it.\n\n10:36.900 --> 10:40.900\nAnd like, it was pretty, pretty good and pretty sexy.\n\n10:40.900 --> 10:45.900\nAnd then she kind of did a little stumble backwards and in high ass platform heels.\n\n10:45.900 --> 10:52.900\nShe caught herself, jumped back and jumped up and hit the beat with every other dancer behind her.\n\n10:52.900 --> 10:53.900\nShe couldn't even see.\n\n10:53.900 --> 10:58.900\nSo if anybody's trying to talk shit about her almost wiped out, and I was like, no, not only did she almost wipe out,\n\n10:58.900 --> 11:01.900\nshe proved that she's in better shape than anybody else.\n\n11:01.900 --> 11:03.900\nYeah, that was amazing.\n\n11:03.900 --> 11:04.900\nI think she'll be fine.\n\n11:04.900 --> 11:05.900\nI think she will.\n\n11:05.900 --> 11:06.900\nPR wise.\n\n11:06.900 --> 11:08.900\nI have a feeling that's not going to dig her.\n\n11:08.900 --> 11:16.900\nIf she fell on her ass and chipped over the side and like kicked the person in the face by accident, that would be, you know, clickbait for a long time.\n\n11:16.900 --> 11:23.900\nI think with Bey, as I call her, she'd have to do more than that to start to suffer a cue rating.\n\n11:23.900 --> 11:24.900\nRight.\n\n11:24.900 --> 11:33.900\nShe'd have to, as she kicked up, her shoe would have to hit the new Twin Towers.\n\n11:33.900 --> 11:41.900\nOkay, I was going to say like a prematurely born baby.\n\n11:41.900 --> 11:46.900\nAnd that land on the baby.\n\n11:46.900 --> 11:53.900\nAnd I remember like, oh, and then she'd have to stand up and say, no, no, let him take it like a man.\n\n11:53.900 --> 12:01.900\nAnd the parents would be like, no, but Beyonce, we want to just lift the shoe relative to this baby, developing baby.\n\n12:01.900 --> 12:06.900\nAnd she's like, if he was born, he can live.\n\n12:06.900 --> 12:10.900\nAnd if he dies, he didn't deserve to be born.\n\n12:10.900 --> 12:16.900\nAnd then that, I think people would be like hashtag, like maybe Beyonce, maybe not.\n\n12:16.900 --> 12:18.900\nThere might be a backlash.\n\n12:18.900 --> 12:26.900\nOr like if she went like all the single ladies and then she went like this and it said like Christ lives.\n\n12:26.900 --> 12:28.900\nIt's like on her breast.\n\n12:28.900 --> 12:31.900\nShe'd gain some fans but lose more.\n\n12:31.900 --> 12:38.900\nI'd feel like anybody that brings a preemie to a Super Bowl half time celebration.\n\n12:38.900 --> 12:47.900\nIf Beyonce brought up, if she brought up, she was like all the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies.\n\n12:47.900 --> 12:51.900\nWhen you're a single lady, you want a man and you don't want to vaccinate your kid.\n\n12:51.900 --> 12:59.900\nAnd then she brings out a kid, like a four-year-old kid and there's a giant hypodermic needle.\n\n12:59.900 --> 13:03.900\nAnd then there's a certificate of vaccination with no signature on it.\n\n13:03.900 --> 13:07.900\nAnd then it was like in her side, she goes, all the single ladies, what's your name, ma'am?\n\n13:07.900 --> 13:10.900\nMargaret Dawson from Montana.\n\n13:10.900 --> 13:12.900\nAll the single ladies, what's your name, sir?\n\n13:12.900 --> 13:13.900\nBob Dawson.\n\n13:13.900 --> 13:15.900\nAll the single ladies, all the single ladies.\n\n13:15.900 --> 13:16.900\nAnd you're here to vaccinate your kid?\n\n13:16.900 --> 13:17.900\nYeah.\n\n13:17.900 --> 13:20.900\nAll the single ladies, well, I'm here to talk you out of it.\n\n13:20.900 --> 13:25.900\nMake it to the bop, put it to the stop, put it on the flap, top, top.\n\n13:25.900 --> 13:29.900\nAnd then like, but we really want to vaccinate our kid.\n\n13:29.900 --> 13:31.900\nAnd she's like, I don't care, I'm not letting you.\n\n13:31.900 --> 13:36.900\nAnd then she like kicks the giant needle and it breaks.\n\n13:36.900 --> 13:39.900\nAnd all the vaccination goes into the football field.\n\n13:39.900 --> 13:42.900\nAnd she's like, that's where it belongs, in the dirt.\n\n13:42.900 --> 13:45.900\nDon't vaccinate your kids.\n\n13:45.900 --> 13:51.900\nAnd then Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy drop down on parachutes.\n\n13:51.900 --> 13:54.900\nWait, what's their mission?\n\n13:54.900 --> 13:56.900\nSupport.\n\n13:56.900 --> 14:01.900\nI thought they were like threshold guardians where they're going to say no.\n\n14:01.900 --> 14:03.900\nOh God, no, no, no, they're all into it.\n\n14:03.900 --> 14:07.900\nIn this world where Beyonce suffers a little bit from the halftime show.\n\n14:07.900 --> 14:09.900\nIf none of that happened, I think she'll be fine.\n\n14:09.900 --> 14:11.900\nI think she will be fine.\n\n14:11.900 --> 14:14.900\nJanet Jackson, however.\n\n14:14.900 --> 14:16.900\nOne titty from infamy.\n\n14:16.900 --> 14:18.900\nShowed her nipple.\n\n14:18.900 --> 14:20.900\nShe rolled the dice.\n\n14:20.900 --> 14:22.900\nShe paid the piper.\n\n14:22.900 --> 14:26.900\nNot the price that we could have.\n\n14:26.900 --> 14:29.900\nThe piper knows what the price is.\n\n14:29.900 --> 14:31.900\nDoes the piper not like to rhyme?\n\n14:31.900 --> 14:33.900\nI don't pay the piper.\n\n14:33.900 --> 14:35.900\nI'm sorry, I don't.\n\n14:35.900 --> 14:37.900\nPut a pen on it.\n\n14:37.900 --> 14:39.900\nI never pay the price.\n\n14:39.900 --> 14:41.900\nI pay the piper.\n\n14:41.900 --> 14:44.900\nThe piper knows what the price is.\n\n14:44.900 --> 14:47.900\nI let the piper handle my money.\n\n14:47.900 --> 14:51.900\nYou're not at that stage yet.\n\n14:51.900 --> 14:56.900\nIt's the worst show ever if you're just tuning in.\n\n14:56.900 --> 14:59.900\nI think this is still a thing you tune into, right?\n\n14:59.900 --> 15:02.900\nPeople are probably flipping podcasts right now.\n\n15:02.900 --> 15:04.900\nCan you flip? I guess you can flip.\n\n15:04.900 --> 15:07.900\nI think you're flipping between Kevin Pollack and this.\n\n15:07.900 --> 15:11.900\nWhat people don't know is that we have a cavalcade of stars.\n\n15:11.900 --> 15:16.900\nYou and I could start off as clumsily as we possibly could.\n\n15:16.900 --> 15:20.900\nThis show will succeed based on the energy of the rocket fuel\n\n15:20.900 --> 15:23.900\nthat we have in the booster, which I call the green room.\n\n15:23.900 --> 15:25.900\nLet's start out.\n\n15:25.900 --> 15:27.900\nLet's make a new friend in Hollywood.\n\n15:27.900 --> 15:29.900\nLet's talk to our new friend.\n\n15:29.900 --> 15:31.900\nShe's here.\n\n15:31.900 --> 15:35.900\nYou may recognize her from the recent hit.\n\n15:35.900 --> 15:38.900\nGod damn it. I don't watch TV anymore.\n\n15:38.900 --> 15:41.900\nLife in pieces. Go fuck yourself, America.\n\n15:41.900 --> 15:44.900\nNo, she's wonderful.\n\n15:44.900 --> 15:46.900\nWe're going to talk to her about life and acting.\n\n15:46.900 --> 15:51.900\nPlease welcome Zoe Lister Jr. Jones.\n\n15:51.900 --> 15:53.900\nLister Jr.\n\n15:53.900 --> 15:55.900\nJunior?\n\n15:55.900 --> 15:57.900\nZoe Lister Jr.\n\n15:57.900 --> 15:59.900\nThat's it.\n\n15:59.900 --> 16:01.900\nThat one.\n\n16:01.900 --> 16:06.900\nWe need to take 10 minutes to talk about what I just did.\n\n16:06.900 --> 16:08.900\nHello, Zoe Lister Jr.\n\n16:08.900 --> 16:10.900\nI like that a lot better than my name.\n\n16:10.900 --> 16:12.900\nIs it tiny Lister Jr.?\n\n16:12.900 --> 16:16.900\nThat's the guy that's like the Zeus guy that like he does the pecs.\n\n16:16.900 --> 16:19.900\nLike it's an 80s thing.\n\n16:19.900 --> 16:21.900\nZoe Lister Jr.\n\n16:21.900 --> 16:27.900\nHow's your dad? The infamous Zoe Lister.\n\n16:27.900 --> 16:29.900\nZoe Lister Jones.\n\n16:29.900 --> 16:31.900\nDon't confuse me.\n\n16:31.900 --> 16:33.900\nI'm tiny Lister Jones.\n\n16:33.900 --> 16:35.900\nHere's the next thing I'm going to get wrong.\n\n16:35.900 --> 16:39.900\nThe most recent project that you've done is this movie and it's called Consumed.\n\n16:39.900 --> 16:41.900\nVery good.\n\n16:41.900 --> 16:43.900\nNailed it.\n\n16:43.900 --> 16:45.900\nCalled it Consumption 8 times.\n\n16:45.900 --> 16:47.900\nI'm busy. I'm a workaholic.\n\n16:47.900 --> 16:49.900\nI don't know nothing about nothing.\n\n16:49.900 --> 16:52.900\nWhich is the combination of being an alcoholic who works.\n\n16:52.900 --> 16:56.900\nThe workaholic covers the scent of the alcohol.\n\n16:56.900 --> 17:00.900\nPeople are like, well, he's getting shit done. He can't be that drunk.\n\n17:00.900 --> 17:05.900\nConsumed, it's a horror movie?\n\n17:05.900 --> 17:07.900\nIt's a dramatic thriller.\n\n17:07.900 --> 17:09.900\nBut it has some horrifying elements.\n\n17:09.900 --> 17:13.900\nIt takes place in the world of genetically modified organisms.\n\n17:13.900 --> 17:15.900\nIs this something that you wrote or you're acting in?\n\n17:15.900 --> 17:20.900\nI co-wrote it with my husband and co-produced it and yet act in it.\n\n17:20.900 --> 17:23.900\nYou're a workaholic. Do you also drink or are you just a worker?\n\n17:23.900 --> 17:24.900\nI don't drink.\n\n17:24.900 --> 17:25.900\nBut you just work a lot?\n\n17:25.900 --> 17:26.900\nThat's good.\n\n17:26.900 --> 17:27.900\nI vape.\n\n17:27.900 --> 17:28.900\nDo you not drink?\n\n17:28.900 --> 17:29.900\nYou're a vape-aholic.\n\n17:29.900 --> 17:32.900\nBecause you used to or because people that raised you did?\n\n17:32.900 --> 17:35.900\nNo. Well, I did used to.\n\n17:35.900 --> 17:37.900\nPeople who raised me also did.\n\n17:37.900 --> 17:41.900\nBut I just prefer that vape life. I don't know.\n\n17:41.900 --> 17:45.900\nIt's better for your skin. It makes it less puffy.\n\n17:45.900 --> 17:46.900\nYeah, less puffy.\n\n17:46.900 --> 17:48.900\nI'm turning into Shatner.\n\n17:48.900 --> 17:50.900\nThere's no hangovers.\n\n17:50.900 --> 17:53.900\nOnce you notice it, it's too late.\n\n17:53.900 --> 17:55.900\nLike, oh, I drank for 40 years.\n\n17:55.900 --> 17:59.900\nIt's not like you could be like, oh, I'm going to now start eating wheat thins.\n\n17:59.900 --> 18:01.900\nThere's no reverse.\n\n18:01.900 --> 18:06.900\nI like that in this day and age wheat thins are like the healthiest thing you can think of.\n\n18:06.900 --> 18:09.900\nWheat thins for me are like dessert.\n\n18:09.900 --> 18:11.900\nAll right.\n\n18:11.900 --> 18:15.900\nIt's not a competition.\n\n18:15.900 --> 18:21.900\nZoe, when you're living that vape life,\n\n18:21.900 --> 18:23.900\ndo you not get the munchies and want a snack?\n\n18:23.900 --> 18:25.900\nI do. I do.\n\n18:25.900 --> 18:28.900\nBut, you know, I keep all wheat thins out of my house.\n\n18:28.900 --> 18:31.900\nThe wheat thins are...\n\n18:31.900 --> 18:34.900\nI don't think wheat thins are even in production anymore.\n\n18:34.900 --> 18:37.900\nThey absolutely are.\n\n18:37.900 --> 18:39.900\nAnd I know that they're not healthy,\n\n18:39.900 --> 18:42.900\nbut there is a holdover from the 80s culture where there was such a thing.\n\n18:42.900 --> 18:44.900\nI know. Those were the healthiest things.\n\n18:44.900 --> 18:47.900\nYeah, it was like the font suggested health.\n\n18:47.900 --> 18:48.900\nI know.\n\n18:48.900 --> 18:52.900\nIt's like beautiful radiant. There's like wheat.\n\n18:52.900 --> 18:55.900\nLike there's a stalk of wheat.\n\n18:55.900 --> 18:57.900\nAnd then the other word is thin.\n\n18:57.900 --> 18:58.900\nThin. Yeah.\n\n18:58.900 --> 19:00.900\nYou could do that in the 80s and people would just be like,\n\n19:00.900 --> 19:02.900\nlook, this is a good faith agreement.\n\n19:02.900 --> 19:05.900\nLike, why would a box lie to me?\n\n19:05.900 --> 19:06.900\nYeah.\n\n19:06.900 --> 19:11.900\nDid wheat thins have like the pictures on the back with all the different like toppings you could?\n\n19:11.900 --> 19:13.900\nOh, that was triscus.\n\n19:13.900 --> 19:15.900\nOh, those were really nasty.\n\n19:15.900 --> 19:17.900\nYeah, no, wheat thins were delicious.\n\n19:17.900 --> 19:19.900\nTriscus are better than wheat thins. They're both good.\n\n19:19.900 --> 19:20.900\nI like them both.\n\n19:20.900 --> 19:22.900\nA triscus.\n\n19:22.900 --> 19:24.900\nWell, we found out what our show is about.\n\n19:24.900 --> 19:28.900\nTriscus are fucking garbage.\n\n19:34.900 --> 19:36.900\nOh, we chapped into something.\n\n19:36.900 --> 19:37.900\nYeah.\n\n19:37.900 --> 19:38.900\nYeah, well, I...\n\n19:38.900 --> 19:40.900\nThis should be Vinny's new platform.\n\n19:43.900 --> 19:44.900\nHe's got the youth.\n\n19:44.900 --> 19:48.900\nSo you're being a sensible vape snacker. What do you munch on?\n\n19:48.900 --> 19:53.900\nOh, a variety of like gluten-free snack items.\n\n19:53.900 --> 19:54.900\nNo wheat.\n\n19:54.900 --> 19:59.900\nDid you find out, did you gauge and go, oh shit, I'm a celiac?\n\n19:59.900 --> 20:00.900\nIs that what it's called?\n\n20:00.900 --> 20:03.900\nNo, I'm not celiac. I'm like, I have a sensitivity.\n\n20:03.900 --> 20:06.900\nAnd you know, like when you go to a restaurant, you say like, I don't eat gluten.\n\n20:06.900 --> 20:08.900\nThey're always like, is it an allergy?\n\n20:08.900 --> 20:10.900\nThey're calling you out.\n\n20:10.900 --> 20:14.900\nThat's like when you go to the restaurant and go table for five, and there's only two of you,\n\n20:14.900 --> 20:16.900\nand you're like, are they all here?\n\n20:16.900 --> 20:19.900\nYeah, I'm three of them.\n\n20:19.900 --> 20:22.900\nYeah, yeah, yeah, no.\n\n20:22.900 --> 20:24.900\nI don't have celiac. That's like legit.\n\n20:24.900 --> 20:28.900\nI'm an actress. I make shit up and then like make my life harder.\n\n20:28.900 --> 20:33.900\nBut the gluten thing, we don't have to talk about this all night,\n\n20:33.900 --> 20:36.900\nbut you're a good person to talk to about it.\n\n20:36.900 --> 20:41.900\nGod damn it, Harmon. Get your shit together.\n\n20:41.900 --> 20:48.900\nThe reason why it's like in the zeitgeist is because we,\n\n20:48.900 --> 20:53.900\nyou don't have to be allergic to it in order to possibly benefit from cutting it out.\n\n20:53.900 --> 20:54.900\nCorrect. Yeah.\n\n20:54.900 --> 20:56.900\nThere are a lot of people with gluten sensitivities.\n\n20:56.900 --> 20:59.900\nThere's a lot of pesticides on wheat and people have.\n\n20:59.900 --> 21:01.900\nBut even if you don't have a sensitivity, I guess that's my question.\n\n21:01.900 --> 21:06.900\nLike it's not about, oh, we're all finding out some of us or have reactions to it.\n\n21:06.900 --> 21:10.900\nIs it more like carbs where we're like, oh, we, we cracked the code?\n\n21:10.900 --> 21:15.900\nOh yeah. I mean, there's like the whole like paleo craze where you like cut out starches too.\n\n21:15.900 --> 21:19.900\nBut like that's been going on. Yeah. I mean, if you want to, if you want to be thin,\n\n21:19.900 --> 21:23.900\nyou don't eat wheat, which is why wheat things are just a terrible snack.\n\n21:23.900 --> 21:27.900\nThat's, I mean, now that we look back on it, it's like, of course that's what they were,\n\n21:27.900 --> 21:32.900\nthey knew that in the boardroom. They're like, we shouldn't call it wheat fats.\n\n21:32.900 --> 21:34.900\nIt's going to make them fat.\n\n21:34.900 --> 21:37.900\nThat's why I like a Trisket because it just tried to fucking lie to you.\n\n21:37.900 --> 21:39.900\nFuck Trisket.\n\n21:39.900 --> 21:44.900\nA Trisket named itself as a mythical character, a Trisket.\n\n21:44.900 --> 21:48.900\nWhen they were coming up with the name Marlboro, they weren't like,\n\n21:48.900 --> 21:50.900\nwhat sounds the most like cancer?\n\n21:50.900 --> 21:51.900\nYeah.\n\n21:51.900 --> 21:54.900\nWhat we want to drive home is what's going to happen.\n\n21:54.900 --> 21:57.900\nThey want to, they want to whisk you away. Yeah.\n\n21:57.900 --> 21:58.900\nCool.\n\n21:58.900 --> 22:02.900\nBut Trisket is a biscuit that's Trisk. Like, what is it?\n\n22:02.900 --> 22:04.900\nWell, how do they get that name?\n\n22:04.900 --> 22:10.900\nI bet it's tri, I bet that, my guess, my guess, three forms of fucking something.\n\n22:10.900 --> 22:13.900\nLike, do you get three farms of protein? Yeah.\n\n22:13.900 --> 22:15.900\nYou got your breads and your cereals and your grains.\n\n22:15.900 --> 22:18.900\nI'll bet you a million dollars. No, I won't bet you a million dollars.\n\n22:18.900 --> 22:20.900\nNo, no, no, bet me a million dollars.\n\n22:20.900 --> 22:22.900\nNo, no, I did not bet you a million dollars.\n\n22:22.900 --> 22:26.900\nYou're kind of tying into the, a Tisket, a Tasket, right?\n\n22:26.900 --> 22:29.900\nOh, shit, no, that's it.\n\n22:29.900 --> 22:31.900\nBut why are then, why the Trisket?\n\n22:31.900 --> 22:34.900\nOkay, I'm going back to my, on the back of the Trisket box,\n\n22:34.900 --> 22:40.900\nI bet there's like a weird fucking triangle where there's like a basket of bread\n\n22:40.900 --> 22:46.900\nand then like a bundle of wheat and then like a chicken with a bicycle or something.\n\n22:46.900 --> 22:50.900\nAnd it's like, and it's like, you get all three and it's like, it's good for you.\n\n22:50.900 --> 22:54.900\nAnd then there's probably like a woman in a leotard like doing a, doing the splits.\n\n22:54.900 --> 22:59.900\nThis is my guess. Actually, that's not being my guess and turned into me.\n\n22:59.900 --> 23:02.900\nJust creating pornography for myself.\n\n23:02.900 --> 23:06.900\nAnd then there's like a guy in a Superman costume just watching from the corner.\n\n23:06.900 --> 23:08.900\nHe's watching the chicken on the bicycle though.\n\n23:08.900 --> 23:10.900\nYeah, yeah, no, there's a dotted line.\n\n23:10.900 --> 23:13.900\nAnd if you, it stops, it stops halfway.\n\n23:13.900 --> 23:18.900\nAnd if you like, they discerning consumers of Trisket, they're like, no, he's into the chicken.\n\n23:18.900 --> 23:22.900\nNo, that's his game. Yeah.\n\n23:22.900 --> 23:26.900\nUm, okay. Well, I was, so you mentioned vaping.\n\n23:26.900 --> 23:30.900\nIs it like, like, like we, we, we respect any privacy you want.\n\n23:30.900 --> 23:34.900\nYou're a new friend. Do you, do you want to, can we talk about pot for a little bit?\n\n23:34.900 --> 23:36.900\nOh, we can talk about pot.\n\n23:36.900 --> 23:40.900\nSo Sativa Indica, I'm just trying to figure this out.\n\n23:40.900 --> 23:42.900\nWell, you are, you're just trying to figure it out.\n\n23:42.900 --> 23:46.900\nI've been a 43 years old smoking pot since I was 18.\n\n23:46.900 --> 23:50.900\nBut I, I think this, I don't know which is the one that makes me check my pulse and, and right.\n\n23:50.900 --> 23:52.900\nDon't get high anymore.\n\n23:52.900 --> 23:58.900\nYeah. So Tiva's the upper and it indicates like to be a little sleepier.\n\n23:58.900 --> 24:02.900\nI'm in the process of an experiment and I could, so I did the first half of it.\n\n24:02.900 --> 24:08.900\nI went, I went to a party and I, and I, so I've talked to my girlfriend about this because she vapes like you.\n\n24:08.900 --> 24:12.900\nShe's part of this whipper snapper, vape in generation.\n\n24:12.900 --> 24:16.900\nAnd I, oh, where is it?\n\n24:16.900 --> 24:20.900\nOh shit. I'll never pot research. Okay. Here we go.\n\n24:20.900 --> 24:31.900\nSo I started. So this is the first half because this is the, I, it's a 838 PM Sativa big hit blue dream.\n\n24:31.900 --> 24:33.900\nI think that's the kind of pot.\n\n24:33.900 --> 24:34.900\nYeah.\n\n24:34.900 --> 24:36.900\nAt animals screening.\n\n24:36.900 --> 24:41.900\nThat's a restaurant here. And yeah, people love it.\n\n24:41.900 --> 24:44.900\nVery uncomfortable.\n\n24:44.900 --> 24:45.900\nAnxious.\n\n24:45.900 --> 24:48.900\nConstantly conscious of chest.\n\n24:48.900 --> 24:50.900\nTwo deep breaths helped.\n\n24:50.900 --> 24:57.900\nHad to stop breathing after noting a slash hallucinating the notion that people are watching me breathing.\n\n24:57.900 --> 25:00.900\nThat's all 838.\n\n25:00.900 --> 25:01.900\nWow.\n\n25:01.900 --> 25:05.900\nAnd then 842 it says still same a little better.\n\n25:05.900 --> 25:07.900\nDoesn't make, even make sense.\n\n25:07.900 --> 25:08.900\nHow can it still be the same?\n\n25:08.900 --> 25:09.900\nAnd a little bit better.\n\n25:09.900 --> 25:11.900\nJust say a little better, but he's high.\n\n25:11.900 --> 25:12.900\nYeah.\n\n25:12.900 --> 25:15.900\n852, 10 minutes after that, this is the last injury.\n\n25:15.900 --> 25:17.900\nJust high.\n\n25:17.900 --> 25:19.900\nReally fucking high.\n\n25:19.900 --> 25:22.900\nAs high as you can get without a net negative experience.\n\n25:22.900 --> 25:23.900\nWithout a negative experience.\n\n25:23.900 --> 25:25.900\nAnd then a capital M.\n\n25:25.900 --> 25:27.900\nAlso.\n\n25:27.900 --> 25:28.900\nYeah.\n\n25:28.900 --> 25:29.900\nI think I started having fun at that point.\n\n25:29.900 --> 25:31.900\nRight. You're like, fuck this.\n\n25:31.900 --> 25:44.900\nSo it looks like, and that was my estimation is like, I think getting high on pot is worth what happens to me often, which is this 838 to 852.\n\n25:44.900 --> 25:46.900\nI'm bad at math.\n\n25:46.900 --> 25:47.900\nYeah.\n\n25:47.900 --> 25:48.900\nAre you good at it?\n\n25:48.900 --> 25:49.900\nNo, no, of course not.\n\n25:49.900 --> 25:50.900\nOkay. All right.\n\n25:50.900 --> 25:51.900\nSay what?\n\n25:51.900 --> 25:52.900\n14 minutes.\n\n25:52.900 --> 25:53.900\nOh, really?\n\n25:53.900 --> 25:54.900\nYeah.\n\n25:54.900 --> 25:56.900\nYeah, that's even better than I thought.\n\n25:56.900 --> 26:02.900\nIt's 14 minutes of like, I'm checking my pulse and like, I'm worried that everyone knows I'm high.\n\n26:02.900 --> 26:03.900\nYep.\n\n26:03.900 --> 26:07.900\nAnd then I'm too old to be getting high.\n\n26:07.900 --> 26:10.900\nBut then you like, you like mellowed into it and you had a great time.\n\n26:10.900 --> 26:11.900\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n26:11.900 --> 26:12.900\nYeah.\n\n26:12.900 --> 26:13.900\nPot's the best.\n\n26:13.900 --> 26:17.900\nLike, it's just so much better than alcohol because alcohol, which you're seeing me on.\n\n26:17.900 --> 26:18.900\nRight.\n\n26:18.900 --> 26:19.900\nIt's like.\n\n26:19.900 --> 26:20.900\nRight.\n\n26:20.900 --> 26:21.900\nLike, just like killing yourself.\n\n26:21.900 --> 26:22.900\nLike you're just slowly falling asleep.\n\n26:22.900 --> 26:23.900\nYeah.\n\n26:23.900 --> 26:24.900\nIn front of and making it everyone else's problem.\n\n26:24.900 --> 26:26.900\nZoe, did you say which one you prefer?\n\n26:26.900 --> 26:28.900\nThe Sativa or Indica?\n\n26:28.900 --> 26:29.900\nI prefer Sativa.\n\n26:29.900 --> 26:30.900\nYeah.\n\n26:30.900 --> 26:31.900\nI don't need help.\n\n26:31.900 --> 26:34.900\nAnd so you're saying the idea because I'm glad you didn't say head high and body high,\n\n26:34.900 --> 26:36.900\nwhich has never meant anything.\n\n26:36.900 --> 26:41.900\nBecause if your head was high, your body would freak out and vice versa.\n\n26:41.900 --> 26:42.900\nFor sure.\n\n26:42.900 --> 26:43.900\nYeah.\n\n26:43.900 --> 26:44.900\nHold on.\n\n26:44.900 --> 26:45.900\nI'm processing that.\n\n26:45.900 --> 26:48.900\nIf your body's high, my head's going to be like, whoa.\n\n26:48.900 --> 26:49.900\nYeah.\n\n26:49.900 --> 26:50.900\nYeah.\n\n26:50.900 --> 26:51.900\nYeah.\n\n26:51.900 --> 26:52.900\nYeah.\n\n26:52.900 --> 26:53.900\nTotally.\n\n26:53.900 --> 26:54.900\nHigh?\n\n26:54.900 --> 26:55.900\nNo.\n\n26:55.900 --> 26:56.900\nDoesn't body high include head?\n\n26:56.900 --> 26:57.900\nIsn't that like.\n\n26:57.900 --> 27:01.900\nI think the people using the phrases head high and body high are so used to being high that\n\n27:01.900 --> 27:04.900\nthey don't know what it's like to be bad high.\n\n27:04.900 --> 27:07.900\nAnybody who can get bad high is like, and whose life depends.\n\n27:07.900 --> 27:08.900\nYeah.\n\n27:08.900 --> 27:09.900\nThey're like, head high, body high.\n\n27:09.900 --> 27:10.900\nJesus Christ.\n\n27:10.900 --> 27:11.900\nDude, what are you talking about?\n\n27:11.900 --> 27:13.900\nYou're scaring me even more.\n\n27:13.900 --> 27:14.900\nFoot high, arm high.\n\n27:14.900 --> 27:16.900\nIt's the worst show to not have Spencer here tonight.\n\n27:16.900 --> 27:18.900\nHe would settle this for us.\n\n27:18.900 --> 27:19.900\nWe have no Spencer tonight.\n\n27:19.900 --> 27:20.900\nNo, it's punishment.\n\n27:20.900 --> 27:22.900\nHe should not take off.\n\n27:22.900 --> 27:28.900\nI like that you're like, though, I think like a real time documentation is cool.\n\n27:28.900 --> 27:29.900\nYeah.\n\n27:29.900 --> 27:30.900\nYeah.\n\n27:30.900 --> 27:32.900\nMy girlfriend said, well, just do both and like, let's figure it out.\n\n27:32.900 --> 27:33.900\nYeah.\n\n27:33.900 --> 27:34.900\nOkay.\n\n27:34.900 --> 27:35.900\nBut we have to spread it out over days.\n\n27:35.900 --> 27:36.900\nSo that's Sativa.\n\n27:36.900 --> 27:37.900\nThat's Sativa.\n\n27:37.900 --> 27:38.900\nSo you haven't done the Indica.\n\n27:38.900 --> 27:39.900\nRight.\n\n27:39.900 --> 27:40.900\nI haven't done the experiment yet.\n\n27:40.900 --> 27:43.900\nAnd then of course there's a million flavors and stuff.\n\n27:43.900 --> 27:44.900\nYeah.\n\n27:44.900 --> 27:45.900\nYeah.\n\n27:45.900 --> 27:46.900\nYeah.\n\n27:46.900 --> 27:47.900\nFor me, I'm such a lightweight with marijuana.\n\n27:47.900 --> 27:49.900\nI can only do Sativa and operate.\n\n27:49.900 --> 27:51.900\nLike if I do Indica, like heavy stuff.\n\n27:51.900 --> 27:57.900\nI hang out with people like Greg Proops, as he says, he gets his weed from Yoda.\n\n27:57.900 --> 27:59.900\nHis weed is wild.\n\n27:59.900 --> 28:03.900\nIf I give his joint a stern glance, I'm fucked up.\n\n28:03.900 --> 28:04.900\nSo I'll do it.\n\n28:04.900 --> 28:09.900\nLike if we're on the bus, like a tour bus for like eight hours where I don't have to do\n\n28:09.900 --> 28:13.900\nanything at all, but he can get up and talk and he's articulate and stuff like that.\n\n28:13.900 --> 28:15.900\nI'm completely wiped out by Indica.\n\n28:15.900 --> 28:21.900\nSo Sativa, I can kind of get by, but I still just want to sit down and eat Triscuits.\n\n28:21.900 --> 28:22.900\nBoom!\n\n28:22.900 --> 28:27.900\nThe Aristocrat, the Packers.\n\n28:27.900 --> 28:34.900\nTired of not being able to eat a box?\n\n28:34.900 --> 28:38.900\nSink your teeth into the cold, hard, croisin' flavor of Triscuits.\n\n28:38.900 --> 28:42.900\nOh, Sam Elliott, do a Triscuits commercial.\n\n28:42.900 --> 28:45.900\nHello, I'm Sam Elliott for Triscuits.\n\n28:45.900 --> 28:47.900\nIt's a new feature, isn't it?\n\n28:47.900 --> 28:49.900\nYeah, I've been to it.\n\n28:49.900 --> 28:53.900\nThe wheat thin is for pussies.\n\n28:53.900 --> 28:59.900\nBut the Triscuits holds up to the cold, hard salami that you're used to.\n\n28:59.900 --> 29:00.900\nI don't fuck with it.\n\n29:00.900 --> 29:01.900\nNo, it's better.\n\n29:01.900 --> 29:03.900\nI'm sorry, I put you on the spot.\n\n29:03.900 --> 29:04.900\nWell, that's the job.\n\n29:04.900 --> 29:08.900\nIt should be like Sam Elliott for pussies.\n\n29:08.900 --> 29:12.900\nWell, I'm Sam Elliott for pussies.\n\n29:12.900 --> 29:17.900\nSometimes when I come home from a long day on the range, I like to take a nice pussie\n\n29:17.900 --> 29:21.900\nand put it on a trisket.\n\n29:21.900 --> 29:24.900\nAll right, he's snuck it in. Synergy.\n\n29:24.900 --> 29:26.900\nHe puts the pussie on the trisket?\n\n29:26.900 --> 29:31.900\nHe puts the pussie on the trisket because the trisket can stand up to whatever you want to put on it.\n\n29:31.900 --> 29:33.900\nAs I understand it, and I don't know his own business.\n\n29:33.900 --> 29:36.900\nYou can't put a pussie on a rit so it'll shatter.\n\n29:36.900 --> 29:44.900\nTrisket has that lattice structure to it that can take what you fucking give it.\n\n29:44.900 --> 29:50.900\nPut your pussie on a cracker that can hold it.\n\n29:50.900 --> 29:53.900\nThat should be Hillary's new platform.\n\n29:53.900 --> 29:58.900\nI put my pussie on a trisket or I get the hose again.\n\n29:58.900 --> 30:03.900\nIt's a silence of the lamp.\n\n30:03.900 --> 30:07.900\nYou just mentioned Hillary Clinton so that was the other uncomfortable place we could not go\n\n30:07.900 --> 30:09.900\nbecause politics are so fucking boring.\n\n30:09.900 --> 30:13.900\nBut I just saw an article that I found absolutely fascinating, but I'm not allowed to find it that fascinating\n\n30:13.900 --> 30:20.900\nbecause I'm a fucking dude and my fascination will bleed over into perceived agenda,\n\n30:20.900 --> 30:22.900\nwhich I do not have.\n\n30:22.900 --> 30:24.900\nI'm sure I'm seething with agenda.\n\n30:24.900 --> 30:31.900\nBut my agenda is I love women and hope they love me and wish that they would fucking wish them all the best.\n\n30:31.900 --> 30:34.900\nSo that's my agenda. I was trying to impress people.\n\n30:34.900 --> 30:39.900\nBut therefore I found it absolutely fascinating that did you see this?\n\n30:39.900 --> 30:44.900\nMaybe it's overhyped, but Madeline Albright and Gloria Steinem,\n\n30:44.900 --> 30:51.900\nwho are these heroes, the dichotomies are clashing because it's like,\n\n30:51.900 --> 30:58.900\noh, what's more progressive, being out of touch or being a woman?\n\n30:58.900 --> 31:04.900\nBecause it was essentially like they were, I would use the verb cos being if that didn't now mean something else\n\n31:04.900 --> 31:07.900\nbefore it meant what it means now.\n\n31:07.900 --> 31:11.900\nIt was like they were like you whippersnappers, you don't know what you're doing.\n\n31:11.900 --> 31:14.900\nLike you're fucking up, why are you backing Bernie Sanders?\n\n31:14.900 --> 31:23.900\nA lot of the sensationalized out of context pieces are like these very stately,\n\n31:23.900 --> 31:29.900\nreally respected power women from a much older generation appearing on talk shows.\n\n31:29.900 --> 31:35.900\nAnd I can't remember who it was that was on the Bill Maher show that said like...\n\n31:35.900 --> 31:37.900\nOh, with Gloria Steinem.\n\n31:37.900 --> 31:39.900\nShe was on.\n\n31:39.900 --> 31:44.900\nI think some of these young ladies are backing Bernie Sanders because that's where the boys are.\n\n31:44.900 --> 31:46.900\nI don't know if that's a quote.\n\n31:46.900 --> 31:50.900\nMy dad told me today that there's something called Bernie Bros.\n\n31:50.900 --> 31:53.900\nThis is a thing and like... That's the guys who dress up like ponies?\n\n31:53.900 --> 31:57.900\nYeah, that's right.\n\n31:57.900 --> 32:00.900\nBrrronies.\n\n32:00.900 --> 32:04.900\nYeah, that's right.\n\n32:04.900 --> 32:05.900\nGo ahead.\n\n32:05.900 --> 32:11.900\nBut no, that there's this now like contingent of Bernie supporters who are like,\n\n32:11.900 --> 32:17.900\nI don't know, misogynist or something, they're saying that they're like, is that the thing?\n\n32:17.900 --> 32:22.900\nAnd yeah.\n\n32:22.900 --> 32:25.900\nRight.\n\n32:25.900 --> 32:31.900\nI heard only those two lines, the Gloria Steinem line about the girls just going where the boys are for Bernie.\n\n32:31.900 --> 32:34.900\nI've only heard that quote taken just alone.\n\n32:34.900 --> 32:36.900\nI don't know what led up to that or what followed that.\n\n32:36.900 --> 32:38.900\nWhich is an important part of the story.\n\n32:38.900 --> 32:40.900\nWhich I'm trying to open up to.\n\n32:40.900 --> 32:44.900\nThat it's out of context and that we're talking about somebody talking for a half hour.\n\n32:44.900 --> 32:50.900\nIt certainly doesn't sound like Gloria Steinem who's just one of the most famous and awesome feminists of all time.\n\n32:50.900 --> 32:54.900\nShe certainly... I don't think anyone would want to be courted to say that.\n\n32:54.900 --> 32:58.900\nBut I do find that... It's a fascinating concept, I guess.\n\n32:58.900 --> 33:01.900\nI was like, as a dude, if I was just up here, I find this fascinating.\n\n33:01.900 --> 33:03.900\nIt's like, oh, yeah, but what's your angle?\n\n33:03.900 --> 33:07.900\nWhat are you trying to prove that feminism is full of shit because women are going to be fighting each other?\n\n33:07.900 --> 33:10.900\nShe's too smart to have said that and meant...\n\n33:10.900 --> 33:16.900\nLeah on the front row is shaking right now. Do you think she actually misspoke and said some terrible shit?\n\n33:16.900 --> 33:22.900\nWell, grab a mic. Just say real quick, Leah. This is Leah, everybody.\n\n33:22.900 --> 33:25.900\nHi. Yeah, I listened to it.\n\n33:25.900 --> 33:32.900\nAnd, yeah, no, it was... She was talking really quickly to Bill Maher, so she just wasn't thinking kind of.\n\n33:32.900 --> 33:36.900\nAnd so she was completely sincere and it wasn't really attached to anything, unfortunately.\n\n33:36.900 --> 33:39.900\nAnd everything else she was saying, I was totally agreeing with.\n\n33:39.900 --> 33:42.900\nAnd the point she was kind of making, I think, is that she was talking...\n\n33:42.900 --> 33:44.900\nLike, she was at the beginning of the feminist movement.\n\n33:44.900 --> 33:50.900\nAnd so she was saying, like, at the beginning it was just a handful of us and we were like the crazy outsider ladies.\n\n33:50.900 --> 33:55.900\nAnd so she was saying, now it's everyone. You know, now it's like a pretty common movement.\n\n33:55.900 --> 34:04.900\nAnd so if you were around the beginning of the feminist movement, the idea of a female being president is so exciting to me right now because I'm fucking 27.\n\n34:04.900 --> 34:11.900\nAnd like, it hasn't been a female president, and if Hillary's not president, maybe I'm going to be fucking 50 before there's president.\n\n34:11.900 --> 34:14.900\nAnd so that's kind of the point she was making.\n\n34:14.900 --> 34:21.900\nBut, no, she just literally... It was incredibly offensive and there's not really a way to defend it at all.\n\n34:21.900 --> 34:28.900\nOther than that's the point I think she was making was that she fought so hard, you know, to like just like try to get women to where they are.\n\n34:28.900 --> 34:34.900\nAnd so then these young women who have just been born into this kind of perceived state of privilege.\n\n34:34.900 --> 34:39.900\nYou know, don't understand what a huge deal it is that we even have a woman in the fucking running right now.\n\n34:39.900 --> 34:45.900\nAnd I love Bernie. I love fucking Bernie. You know, like, I love that he's going around saying all this crazy shit.\n\n34:45.900 --> 34:48.900\nYou also love a nice, cool, coarse light.\n\n34:48.900 --> 34:52.900\nI've been drinking all day. I've been at a Super Bowl party, y'all.\n\n34:52.900 --> 34:54.900\nThere's no better way to wash down a Triske.\n\n34:54.900 --> 34:58.900\nNo, I'm a wheat thin girl. I'm a wheat thin girl, Jeff.\n\n34:58.900 --> 35:00.900\nYou're after having eaten that pussy Triske.\n\n35:00.900 --> 35:02.900\nUnfortunately, it was just...\n\n35:02.900 --> 35:03.900\nI grew up with a bullet.\n\n35:03.900 --> 35:08.900\nIt was just horribly offensive. It was just like totally out of line and offensive.\n\n35:08.900 --> 35:10.900\nCan you say it because I can't...\n\n35:10.900 --> 35:11.900\nIt's just offensive.\n\n35:11.900 --> 35:16.900\nLet me sit back and be fascinated by it. So you're a 27-year-old girl. You don't speak on behalf of all women.\n\n35:16.900 --> 35:18.900\nBut you are at least...\n\n35:18.900 --> 35:19.900\nNot at all.\n\n35:19.900 --> 35:26.900\nLike, talk about what's offensive about it.\n\n35:26.900 --> 35:33.900\nI think I know, but if I pontificate about it, I sound like a fucking AM radio DJ with some kind of weird agenda.\n\n35:33.900 --> 35:35.900\nIt's just absurd because...\n\n35:35.900 --> 35:39.900\nWhat? We're just supposed to like Hillary because she has a vagina.\n\n35:39.900 --> 35:43.900\nWhich is what I just said is partly why I want her to be president.\n\n35:43.900 --> 35:46.900\nBecause I deserve it.\n\n35:46.900 --> 35:51.900\nJust the same way people have talked about how Chris Rock said that there was a black president.\n\n35:51.900 --> 35:52.900\nAnd so that's changed things.\n\n35:52.900 --> 35:57.900\nSo now little black boys can be like, I could be president, which they didn't have before.\n\n35:57.900 --> 36:00.900\nI'm still a woman. I've never had that.\n\n36:00.900 --> 36:03.900\nAnd I want that. And I want my children to have that.\n\n36:03.900 --> 36:05.900\nAnd I want it as soon as fucking possible.\n\n36:05.900 --> 36:07.900\nAnd so I am voting with my pussy.\n\n36:07.900 --> 36:09.900\nAnd I understand that that's inappropriate.\n\n36:09.900 --> 36:12.900\nAnd I also enjoy Bernie. And I like that he's running around.\n\n36:12.900 --> 36:16.900\nSaying everyone gets a pony, that's fun.\n\n36:16.900 --> 36:19.900\nYou're trusting us with the information that you are voting for Hillary and you are doing it for that reason.\n\n36:19.900 --> 36:23.900\nWell, I also just dig her. I think she's like a real groovy lady.\n\n36:23.900 --> 36:27.900\nAnd what we talked about when Rhea Butcher was up here, I think...\n\n36:27.900 --> 36:28.900\nShe said a similar thing.\n\n36:28.900 --> 36:30.900\nBasically, yeah.\n\n36:30.900 --> 36:32.900\nBecause it's like...\n\n36:32.900 --> 36:33.900\nYeah, she was the one, I think.\n\n36:33.900 --> 36:41.900\nWhat the fuck does a president do from top to bottom on the list of things that they accomplished that are the most effective?\n\n36:41.900 --> 36:44.900\nProbably number one has to do with symbology and stuff.\n\n36:44.900 --> 36:46.900\nUpgrade. Upgrade.\n\n36:46.900 --> 36:50.900\nYeah!\n\n36:50.900 --> 36:52.900\nAlright.\n\n36:52.900 --> 36:57.900\nBut why it was so offensive, which is like incredibly obvious,\n\n36:57.900 --> 37:02.900\nis no one saying that like men are voting for Bernie because he has a dick and everyone has a dick.\n\n37:02.900 --> 37:05.900\nFucking Rob Sharob. God damn it.\n\n37:05.900 --> 37:07.900\nHe's so handsome and fun. That was my point.\n\n37:07.900 --> 37:09.900\nI've been drinking all day. I don't know if I said that already.\n\n37:09.900 --> 37:11.900\nSorry, everyone.\n\n37:11.900 --> 37:18.900\nNow, tell me, Leah, was Gloria...\n\n37:18.900 --> 37:20.900\nIs she pro-Hillary?\n\n37:20.900 --> 37:22.900\nYeah, she is.\n\n37:22.900 --> 37:24.900\nDo you think she's saying that?\n\n37:24.900 --> 37:27.900\nLike to kind of like say like, hey, like these...\n\n37:27.900 --> 37:32.900\nIs she like straight out saying, yeah, these women that are voting for Bernie,\n\n37:32.900 --> 37:34.900\nthey're just doing it to get laid, but the real women,\n\n37:34.900 --> 37:36.900\nthe real feminists are over there on Hillary's side.\n\n37:36.900 --> 37:37.900\nIs that what she's saying?\n\n37:37.900 --> 37:42.900\nThe way that I would, you know, most optimistically interpret it was what I already said,\n\n37:42.900 --> 37:45.900\nwas that she was around for the beginning of the movement where everyone was like,\n\n37:45.900 --> 37:47.900\nyou should be barefoot and fucking pregnant,\n\n37:47.900 --> 37:52.900\nand now we've come such a long way in America where it's more insidious that the hatred of women,\n\n37:52.900 --> 37:54.900\nlike you can't just overtly see it.\n\n37:54.900 --> 37:56.900\nIt's been stirred in.\n\n37:56.900 --> 38:00.900\nIt still exists in a very potent way, but you can't just point at it and be like,\n\n38:00.900 --> 38:02.900\nyou should be barefoot and pregnant.\n\n38:02.900 --> 38:07.900\nWe do need to have a female, a woman president as soon as possible because it's been,\n\n38:07.900 --> 38:10.900\nyou know, we've had what, 48 or 49 in a row.\n\n38:10.900 --> 38:17.900\nThe idea that she has Madeleine Hulb right thing, there's a special place in hell for women that don't...\n\n38:17.900 --> 38:19.900\nOkay, so you saw this too, yeah.\n\n38:19.900 --> 38:20.900\nDon't look after the women.\n\n38:20.900 --> 38:22.900\nGloria Steinman's like, yeah, you guys are all being a bunch of dicks.\n\n38:22.900 --> 38:24.900\nLike fucking get on board.\n\n38:24.900 --> 38:25.900\nBut by the way...\n\n38:25.900 --> 38:26.900\nExactly, exactly.\n\n38:26.900 --> 38:28.900\nThat to me, like, I don't mind that.\n\n38:28.900 --> 38:32.900\nI think that's all right because, like, fucking whatever it takes.\n\n38:32.900 --> 38:36.900\nShouldn't they be, shouldn't they be, it's like, I hate to make obvious allegory,\n\n38:36.900 --> 38:41.900\nbut like when you talk about groups and you talk about interest and you talk about all this shit,\n\n38:41.900 --> 38:45.900\nthe alienation versus unification and stuff, and I'm a straight white fat male,\n\n38:45.900 --> 38:47.900\nI'm just looking at all the rest of it.\n\n38:47.900 --> 38:55.900\nBut if a 70-year-old Black Panther said, you know, like we used like really rough and tumble in or out language,\n\n38:55.900 --> 38:57.900\nyou know, would you fault it as much?\n\n38:57.900 --> 38:59.900\nAnd so that was the other fast...\n\n38:59.900 --> 39:02.900\nThat's why I was like, I'm so fascinated with this story because I'm like,\n\n39:02.900 --> 39:05.900\nwait, how am I being fed this on my iPhone next to Amber Alerts?\n\n39:05.900 --> 39:11.900\nIs there already a fucking, like, hamster bottle in place where I'm being told,\n\n39:11.900 --> 39:15.900\nlike, it's the easiest information to get into my mouth that women are fighting again?\n\n39:15.900 --> 39:18.900\nLike, boy, are they ever gonna get along or what?\n\n39:18.900 --> 39:22.900\nHonestly, and I've been drinking Yale Day, so I can't believe I'm saying this in front of an audience,\n\n39:22.900 --> 39:26.900\nbut like, I feel like this weird pushback towards Hillary,\n\n39:26.900 --> 39:28.900\nand I understand that, like, she...\n\n39:28.900 --> 39:32.900\nNo, no, Jeff, this is all I have, you have the bottle of vodka, this isn't fair.\n\n39:32.900 --> 39:33.900\nI don't have anything.\n\n39:33.900 --> 39:34.900\nJeff, there's a bottle of vodka, right?\n\n39:34.900 --> 39:36.900\nI was gonna steal your beer, but it's warm as hell.\n\n39:36.900 --> 39:37.900\nUh, yeah.\n\n39:37.900 --> 39:40.900\nDan, could you maybe pour me some vodka while I continue to...\n\n39:40.900 --> 39:42.900\nYeah, but we got it, we got it.\n\n39:42.900 --> 39:45.900\nBut, okay, so like, it...\n\n39:45.900 --> 39:47.900\nBest intentions is what Jeff was saying.\n\n39:47.900 --> 39:50.900\nHow many drinks would you say you've had today?\n\n39:50.900 --> 39:52.900\nA plethora.\n\n39:52.900 --> 39:54.900\nLike, all beer? Have you been doing spirits?\n\n39:54.900 --> 39:56.900\nNo, it's been like, it's been like vodka.\n\n39:56.900 --> 39:58.900\nIt's been vodka.\n\n39:58.900 --> 39:59.900\nAll right, come on.\n\n39:59.900 --> 40:00.900\nIt's gonna continue to be vodka.\n\n40:00.900 --> 40:01.900\nShe's not Truman Capote, who cares?\n\n40:01.900 --> 40:03.900\nLet's talk to Zoe Lister.\n\n40:03.900 --> 40:05.900\nI'm still making good, lucid points.\n\n40:05.900 --> 40:06.900\nNo, you are.\n\n40:06.900 --> 40:08.900\nOh, god damn it.\n\n40:08.900 --> 40:10.900\nAll right, that was your drink.\n\n40:10.900 --> 40:12.900\nAll right, that's...\n\n40:12.900 --> 40:14.900\nYeah, so that was the one for your down homey.\n\n40:14.900 --> 40:19.900\nMost optimistically, the way I choose to view what her intention was,\n\n40:19.900 --> 40:21.900\nwhich obviously no one's gonna talk about,\n\n40:21.900 --> 40:25.900\nis just that she's thought so hard for like, just even the chance,\n\n40:25.900 --> 40:28.900\neven like an inkling that we could ever have a woman president.\n\n40:28.900 --> 40:32.900\nAnd so to her, it's just like appalling that 18-year-old woman would be like,\n\n40:32.900 --> 40:35.900\nI like Bernie because, you know, because he makes all these great points\n\n40:35.900 --> 40:39.900\nand he's not part of like this corrupt system, you know,\n\n40:39.900 --> 40:41.900\nwhich is all fantastic reasons to vote for him.\n\n40:41.900 --> 40:47.900\nAnd so that's the most genuine, positive way you can view her statements is...\n\n40:47.900 --> 40:51.900\nI totally understand that like, we need a fucking woman president as soon as possible\n\n40:51.900 --> 40:55.900\nand Gloria Steinem is just like viewing these 18-year-old women being for Bernie\n\n40:55.900 --> 40:57.900\nas being like, what are you fucking doing?\n\n40:57.900 --> 40:58.900\nLike, we need a woman president.\n\n40:58.900 --> 41:00.900\nLike, you don't understand what you're doing.\n\n41:00.900 --> 41:05.900\nBut then the fact that she said that they're voting for her because...\n\n41:05.900 --> 41:09.900\nbecause they want to impress the boys is so incredibly offensive\n\n41:09.900 --> 41:11.900\nbecause why aren't the boys trying to impress us?\n\n41:11.900 --> 41:15.900\nIf anything, like the 18-year-old boys are trying so hard to get pussy\n\n41:15.900 --> 41:17.900\nthat like, I have to try negative amount.\n\n41:17.900 --> 41:21.900\nI'm 27 now, I've tried negative amount to get dick my entire life.\n\n41:21.900 --> 41:27.900\nUh, well, I've watched men try like a million times more than me to get pussy\n\n41:27.900 --> 41:30.900\nand so, so why would women be voting for Bernie?\n\n41:30.900 --> 41:31.900\nWhat?\n\n41:31.900 --> 41:35.900\nSorry, I was just asking what cracker you think he put dick on.\n\n41:35.900 --> 41:36.900\nTo me...\n\n41:36.900 --> 41:39.900\nWeethins, the best cracker...\n\n41:39.900 --> 41:48.900\nI would go lateral and slide it between an inverted pair of baked Pringles.\n\n41:48.900 --> 41:49.900\nYeah, Pringles.\n\n41:49.900 --> 41:50.900\nHere's your drink.\n\n41:50.900 --> 41:53.900\nLet's have a hand for our election correspondent.\n\n41:53.900 --> 41:55.900\nYeah!\n\n41:55.900 --> 41:57.900\nShe's been drinking all day.\n\n41:57.900 --> 41:59.900\nShe's got a room temperature course like.\n\n41:59.900 --> 42:00.900\nThank you.\n\n42:00.900 --> 42:02.900\nYeah, so it was offensive, but I don't think she meant it that way.\n\n42:02.900 --> 42:04.900\nLet's not think of as losing a layer.\n\n42:04.900 --> 42:07.900\nLet's think of as gaining a Rob Schrab!\n\n42:07.900 --> 42:09.900\nAlright.\n\n42:12.900 --> 42:17.900\nI'm pretty sure you guys forgot I came tonight.\n\n42:17.900 --> 42:21.900\nI'm pretty sure you guys forgot I was in the back room.\n\n42:21.900 --> 42:24.900\nNo, we were saving like a secret weapon.\n\n42:24.900 --> 42:27.900\nI think you guys forgot that I was here.\n\n42:27.900 --> 42:30.900\nCan we wrap things up with Zoe so we can focus on you?\n\n42:30.900 --> 42:33.900\nZoe, your name means life.\n\n42:33.900 --> 42:34.900\nYeah.\n\n42:34.900 --> 42:42.900\nI learned that from TC2000, the Billy Blank's post-apocalyptic movie from the 90s, direct-to-video.\n\n42:42.900 --> 42:43.900\nYou should watch that.\n\n42:43.900 --> 42:44.900\nReally?\n\n42:44.900 --> 42:45.900\nYeah, you should check it out.\n\n42:45.900 --> 42:47.900\nYou would really like it.\n\n42:47.900 --> 42:48.900\nIs the protagonist named Zoe?\n\n42:48.900 --> 42:51.900\nNo, it's...no.\n\n42:51.900 --> 42:53.900\nHis name is TC2000.\n\n42:53.900 --> 42:54.900\nTC2000, okay.\n\n42:54.900 --> 42:59.900\nBut there's a lady in there named Zoe, and Billy Blank says,\n\n42:59.900 --> 43:01.900\nyour name means life.\n\n43:01.900 --> 43:03.900\nThat's actually how I learned that.\n\n43:03.900 --> 43:04.900\nIs it a Greek root?\n\n43:04.900 --> 43:05.900\nWhat is it?\n\n43:05.900 --> 43:06.900\nIt is.\n\n43:06.900 --> 43:07.900\nIt is.\n\n43:07.900 --> 43:08.900\nYeah.\n\n43:08.900 --> 43:11.900\nMy mom, when I was born, she studied Kabbalah.\n\n43:11.900 --> 43:12.900\nKabbalah?\n\n43:12.900 --> 43:13.900\nOh, God.\n\n43:13.900 --> 43:16.900\nShe studied Kabbalah for sure.\n\n43:16.900 --> 43:22.900\nShe studied Kabbalah, and I was going to call it Kabbalah, but then I...\n\n43:22.900 --> 43:27.900\nYeah, she studied that, and you're not supposed to give your kid a name for a week.\n\n43:27.900 --> 43:28.900\nOh.\n\n43:28.900 --> 43:31.900\nAnd you're supposed to name it the shittiest name you can think of.\n\n43:31.900 --> 43:34.900\nSo that, like, the angel of death passes over.\n\n43:34.900 --> 43:35.900\nI love this.\n\n43:35.900 --> 43:41.900\nYeah, so she named me Dirt Pan, which I should have kept.\n\n43:41.900 --> 43:43.900\nIn English, or there was a Greek version of that?\n\n43:43.900 --> 43:44.900\nNo, no, in English.\n\n43:44.900 --> 43:45.900\nYeah, we're not Greek.\n\n43:45.900 --> 43:46.900\nDirt Pan?\n\n43:46.900 --> 43:47.900\nYeah, Dirt Pan.\n\n43:47.900 --> 43:50.900\nSo for a week, they called you, hey, Dirt Pan, pooped your pants again.\n\n43:50.900 --> 43:51.900\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n43:51.900 --> 43:52.900\nDirt Pan.\n\n43:52.900 --> 43:53.900\nThat's so amazing.\n\n43:53.900 --> 43:54.900\nI've never heard that before.\n\n43:54.900 --> 43:55.900\nYeah.\n\n43:55.900 --> 43:58.900\nI mean, you know, she might have made that, like, Kabbalah law up.\n\n43:58.900 --> 43:59.900\nShe's blamed it on Kabbalah.\n\n43:59.900 --> 44:01.900\nI still believe that.\n\n44:01.900 --> 44:05.900\nShe was just doing her own pippy log stock in society, and she's like, it's Kabbalah.\n\n44:05.900 --> 44:07.900\nYeah, all of her abusive tendencies, she blamed it on Kabbalah.\n\n44:07.900 --> 44:10.900\nAnd then after a week, she goes, okay, you're not Dirt Pan, you're a life.\n\n44:10.900 --> 44:11.900\nRight, yeah.\n\n44:11.900 --> 44:13.900\nWell, from Dirt Pan comes life.\n\n44:13.900 --> 44:15.900\nOh, that's so great.\n\n44:15.900 --> 44:21.900\nMy cat, my cat's name is Fiv, which is F-I-V, because I didn't want to fall in love with her,\n\n44:21.900 --> 44:24.900\nbecause I was told she had F-I-V, which I thought was like H-I-V.\n\n44:24.900 --> 44:28.900\nAnd I thought, like, I rescued this cat, and I was like, I don't want to get attached.\n\n44:28.900 --> 44:31.900\nAnd like, we just started calling it F-I-V or Fiv.\n\n44:31.900 --> 44:32.900\nOh.\n\n44:32.900 --> 44:34.900\nAnd then, you know, let me find out F-I-V.\n\n44:34.900 --> 44:35.900\nOh.\n\n44:35.900 --> 44:36.900\nNot that big of a deal.\n\n44:36.900 --> 44:37.900\nOh.\n\n44:37.900 --> 44:41.900\nBut it was like, but there was a ritual there where it was like, oh, this time went by where\n\n44:41.900 --> 44:46.900\nyou were like actively saying, and then this like goes back to ancient Greece and whatever\n\n44:46.900 --> 44:47.900\nlike Oedipus.\n\n44:47.900 --> 44:48.900\nDetachment.\n\n44:48.900 --> 44:52.900\nOedipus' name is derived from the fact that his feet were big.\n\n44:52.900 --> 44:55.900\nIt was because they tied your feet together when they would lay you on a rock for the\n\n44:55.900 --> 44:57.900\nwolves, which was a Greek abortion.\n\n44:57.900 --> 45:00.900\nLike, they would just go, fuck this kid.\n\n45:00.900 --> 45:01.900\nThat'd be a name.\n\n45:01.900 --> 45:02.900\nGreek abortion?\n\n45:02.900 --> 45:03.900\nYeah.\n\n45:03.900 --> 45:05.900\nInstead of debt, dirt pan.\n\n45:05.900 --> 45:06.900\nYeah.\n\n45:06.900 --> 45:08.900\nIt's like a J-1 on a desk piece.\n\n45:08.900 --> 45:11.900\nOkay, it's time to do some Greek abortions.\n\n45:11.900 --> 45:17.900\nOkay, this one comes to us from the Acropolis.\n\n45:17.900 --> 45:18.900\nWhat's that?\n\n45:18.900 --> 45:20.900\nThird trimester?\n\n45:20.900 --> 45:25.900\nAnyways, but that idea that there's like a spirit passing over, and then there's a point\n\n45:25.900 --> 45:28.900\nwhere it's like, oh, this thing's for keeps.\n\n45:28.900 --> 45:32.900\nI love that you would have a kid and be like, you're a piece of shit.\n\n45:32.900 --> 45:34.900\nYour name's shit face.\n\n45:34.900 --> 45:37.900\nAnd you're like trying to trick the demons.\n\n45:37.900 --> 45:39.900\nOh, that's a shit face.\n\n45:39.900 --> 45:40.900\nI don't want that.\n\n45:40.900 --> 45:42.900\nAnd then you're like, the coast is clear.\n\n45:42.900 --> 45:44.900\nYou're Theodore.\n\n45:44.900 --> 45:46.900\nI fucking love that.\n\n45:46.900 --> 45:48.900\nI love that so much.\n\n45:48.900 --> 45:49.900\nYeah.\n\n45:49.900 --> 45:51.900\nAnd then she couldn't think of a name.\n\n45:51.900 --> 45:55.900\nSo I think probably the dirt pan was prolonged longer than it should have been.\n\n45:55.900 --> 46:00.900\nBut where she got Zoe was like, she was at the back of the baby name book.\n\n46:00.900 --> 46:06.900\nThey literally refer to you for the first week like your mom and dad were calling you dirt pan.\n\n46:06.900 --> 46:08.900\nThat's your handle for that first week?\n\n46:08.900 --> 46:09.900\nI mean, I think so.\n\n46:09.900 --> 46:12.900\nI don't have memories that early, but I think so.\n\n46:12.900 --> 46:14.900\nThat's what you end up doing with kids anyway, though.\n\n46:14.900 --> 46:15.900\nThey all have these little names.\n\n46:15.900 --> 46:17.900\nThey're like, hey, little nook nook.\n\n46:17.900 --> 46:22.900\nI was like, why am I nook nook? Well, you used to eat cat shit out of the fucking vent.\n\n46:22.900 --> 46:24.900\nAnd you'd go nook nook.\n\n46:24.900 --> 46:26.900\nAnd you were like, you did shit all over your face.\n\n46:26.900 --> 46:29.900\nAnd we were like, you're a piece of shit.\n\n46:29.900 --> 46:34.900\nThat's why I love it is because it's like an organic thing that happens where you're like, you're fucking, you're garbage.\n\n46:34.900 --> 46:35.900\nTotally.\n\n46:35.900 --> 46:36.900\nYou're a rug rat.\n\n46:36.900 --> 46:39.900\nYeah, so many people are just like, I mean, hopefully.\n\n46:39.900 --> 46:40.900\nWorship kids.\n\n46:40.900 --> 46:41.900\nWorshiping kids.\n\n46:41.900 --> 46:43.900\nYeah, you got to give them a shitty name for it.\n\n46:43.900 --> 46:50.900\nI used to call my pacifier my noony.\n\n46:50.900 --> 46:53.900\nThat seems like fine information.\n\n46:53.900 --> 46:55.900\nThere's no reason to not say that.\n\n46:55.900 --> 46:56.900\nThat checks out, yeah.\n\n46:56.900 --> 46:58.900\nHow long did you have your pacifier, Rob?\n\n46:58.900 --> 46:59.900\nLike, until what age?\n\n46:59.900 --> 47:00.900\nWay too long.\n\n47:00.900 --> 47:02.900\nLike, until what age?\n\n47:02.900 --> 47:03.900\n12.\n\n47:03.900 --> 47:04.900\nNo, no, no.\n\n47:04.900 --> 47:05.900\nTo the point where...\n\n47:05.900 --> 47:06.900\nWay too long.\n\n47:06.900 --> 47:11.900\nBy the time it was taken away from him, its name was Noony Anastasia Henderson III.\n\n47:11.900 --> 47:12.900\nYeah.\n\n47:12.900 --> 47:17.900\nLike my mom kept throwing it away, I would dig it out of the garbage and be walking around with the house like,\n\n47:17.900 --> 47:20.900\nno, but a thing just sucked my neck.\n\n47:20.900 --> 47:22.900\nI had a banky that I didn't want to part with.\n\n47:22.900 --> 47:23.900\nBanky?\n\n47:23.900 --> 47:24.900\nBanky.\n\n47:24.900 --> 47:25.900\nLike a blanket.\n\n47:25.900 --> 47:26.900\nLike a little blanket.\n\n47:26.900 --> 47:28.900\nYeah, so mine makes more sense.\n\n47:28.900 --> 47:32.900\nWell, that's from Mr. Mom.\n\n47:32.900 --> 47:36.900\nThat wasn't a movie when I had my banky.\n\n47:36.900 --> 47:38.900\nWas it?\n\n47:38.900 --> 47:41.900\nThey called it a banky in Mr. Mom.\n\n47:41.900 --> 47:42.900\nLet's assume I was.\n\n47:42.900 --> 47:43.900\nMine wasn't ripped off.\n\n47:43.900 --> 47:47.900\nI actually, my Noony was, I don't remember.\n\n47:47.900 --> 47:49.900\nThat was original.\n\n47:49.900 --> 47:52.900\nSo, did you have a banky or a wooby or anything like that?\n\n47:52.900 --> 47:54.900\nNo, I didn't have any of those things.\n\n47:54.900 --> 47:56.900\nYou had a dirt pan?\n\n47:56.900 --> 47:57.900\nYeah.\n\n47:57.900 --> 47:58.900\nShe was a dirt pan.\n\n47:58.900 --> 47:59.900\nI was a dirt pan.\n\n47:59.900 --> 48:00.900\nYeah, I didn't need anything.\n\n48:00.900 --> 48:01.900\nWhat is a dirt pan?\n\n48:01.900 --> 48:03.900\nYeah, why do you need a pan to collect dirt?\n\n48:03.900 --> 48:09.900\nWell, when you sweep like a dust pan, but I think she thought that dirt pan was even like...\n\n48:09.900 --> 48:10.900\nYeah.\n\n48:10.900 --> 48:11.900\nLike a bucket of shit.\n\n48:11.900 --> 48:12.900\nWhy would you have a bucket of shit?\n\n48:12.900 --> 48:13.900\nYeah.\n\n48:13.900 --> 48:14.900\nWho knows?\n\n48:14.900 --> 48:15.900\nIt's like worthless.\n\n48:15.900 --> 48:16.900\nThat's my point.\n\n48:16.900 --> 48:17.900\nLike dust isn't that bad.\n\n48:17.900 --> 48:23.900\nIf your parents' friends that are also into Kabbalah come over and like, hey, I've got shit for brands.\n\n48:23.900 --> 48:24.900\nIt's the best.\n\n48:24.900 --> 48:25.900\nIt's a fucking best.\n\n48:25.900 --> 48:27.900\nBut that's what really happens anyway.\n\n48:27.900 --> 48:31.900\nWhen your friends have kids and they're like, do you want to say how to fucking shit fuck?\n\n48:31.900 --> 48:33.900\nThat's what really happens with your kids, right?\n\n48:33.900 --> 48:34.900\nYeah.\n\n48:34.900 --> 48:35.900\nThat's what we all do.\n\n48:35.900 --> 48:36.900\nJust name them like Little Life Ruiner.\n\n48:36.900 --> 48:37.900\nYeah, something like that.\n\n48:37.900 --> 48:38.900\nYes.\n\n48:38.900 --> 48:39.900\nBut like...\n\n48:39.900 --> 48:40.900\nYeah.\n\n48:40.900 --> 48:41.900\nBut we always make those jokes.\n\n48:41.900 --> 48:42.900\nReal in a career.\n\n48:42.900 --> 48:45.900\nIf you go over to your friend's house and you have a six pack and there would be a ballerina.\n\n48:45.900 --> 48:46.900\nYeah.\n\n48:46.900 --> 48:47.900\nYou want to look at little fuck face?\n\n48:47.900 --> 48:48.900\nYeah.\n\n48:48.900 --> 48:49.900\nYeah.\n\n48:49.900 --> 48:50.900\nIt's all...\n\n48:50.900 --> 48:51.900\nWe all talk that way about the little kids.\n\n48:51.900 --> 48:52.900\nYeah.\n\n48:52.900 --> 48:53.900\nPause.\n\n48:53.900 --> 48:54.900\nDream.\n\n48:54.900 --> 48:55.900\nPause.\n\n48:55.900 --> 48:56.900\nDream.\n\n48:56.900 --> 48:57.900\nYeah.\n\n48:57.900 --> 49:00.900\nIt's sort of like a slam poetry thing going on.\n\n49:00.900 --> 49:01.900\nConsumed.\n\n49:01.900 --> 49:02.900\nYes.\n\n49:02.900 --> 49:03.900\nAll...\n\n49:03.900 --> 49:04.900\nSlam poetry would be a great thing.\n\n49:04.900 --> 49:08.900\nAll we learned about it is that you wrote it and produced it and your husband, who I met back\n\n49:08.900 --> 49:14.900\nin college, directed it and produced it, so like independent filmmaking.\n\n49:14.900 --> 49:15.900\nYes.\n\n49:15.900 --> 49:17.400\nWhere are you at with this?\n\n49:17.400 --> 49:18.400\nWhere's this movie?\n\n49:18.400 --> 49:20.380\nWell, where's this movie?\n\n49:20.380 --> 49:23.900\nIt's coming out on iTunes and digital platforms March 22nd.\n\n49:23.900 --> 49:25.580\nNo theatrical release?\n\n49:25.580 --> 49:29.300\nWe did this cool thing with this company called Gather, which is called Theatrical on Demand,\n\n49:29.300 --> 49:34.060\nwhich is kind of like where indie filmmakers are like headed a lot of the time because\n\n49:34.060 --> 49:38.020\nbasically it's like crowdsourcing theatrical, a theatrical release.\n\n49:38.020 --> 49:43.100\nSo you're not relying on a distribution company to put in a few theaters and then be up against\n\n49:43.100 --> 49:44.100\nhuge tentpole movies.\n\n49:44.100 --> 49:45.100\nYou're actually...\n\n49:45.100 --> 49:46.100\nIs that then...\n\n49:46.100 --> 49:50.540\nDoes that then allow it to be only in theaters where there is a demand?\n\n49:50.540 --> 49:51.540\nRight.\n\n49:51.540 --> 49:53.420\nSo you can still see the movie that way.\n\n49:53.420 --> 49:55.860\nThat'll be going on for the next few months, too.\n\n49:55.860 --> 50:01.740\nIf you just go to the movie's website, consumedthemovie.com, you basically see anywhere in the country\n\n50:01.740 --> 50:05.180\nyou can type in where you are and you can see if there's a screening and if 60 people\n\n50:05.180 --> 50:06.500\nsign up, the screening happens.\n\n50:06.500 --> 50:07.500\nOh, that's awesome.\n\n50:07.500 --> 50:08.500\nThat's cool.\n\n50:08.500 --> 50:09.500\nThat's cool.\n\n50:09.500 --> 50:10.500\nLet's go at this point.\n\n50:10.500 --> 50:11.500\nYeah.\n\n50:11.500 --> 50:12.500\nI mean, it seems like...\n\n50:12.500 --> 50:13.500\nYeah, that's the way it should go.\n\n50:13.500 --> 50:14.500\nEspecially there's so much content.\n\n50:14.500 --> 50:16.500\nSo many people are making movies that there's just not enough room for...\n\n50:16.500 --> 50:21.140\nWell, also, it's always this tiered thing, like we're still living in this old world thing.\n\n50:21.140 --> 50:25.220\nThe people who just want to make their movie and distribute it, which is totally great,\n\n50:25.220 --> 50:26.220\nit's like...\n\n50:26.220 --> 50:29.980\nBut we're all drawn into this whole theatrical distribution thing and there's this really\n\n50:29.980 --> 50:31.500\nold system where they...\n\n50:31.500 --> 50:36.620\nIt's a little bit based on making you ashamed of how many people want to come out and watch\n\n50:36.620 --> 50:37.620\nyour movie.\n\n50:37.620 --> 50:38.620\nYeah.\n\n50:38.620 --> 50:39.620\nIt's sort of like...\n\n50:39.620 --> 50:42.660\nIt's like, oh, we'll go to the 20 cities, these three cities, and based on how they\n\n50:42.660 --> 50:46.500\nperform, then we'll try to have five cities, then we'll do seven cities, oh, bad news,\n\n50:46.500 --> 50:48.460\nguys, a lot of that.\n\n50:48.460 --> 50:53.260\nIt doesn't have to be that way in a world where George Clooney can get online and go,\n\n50:53.260 --> 50:56.940\nif three people give me a dollar for AIDS research, I'll cut my mustache off and put\n\n50:56.940 --> 50:57.940\non a shoe on my head.\n\n50:57.940 --> 50:58.940\nIt's something...\n\n50:58.940 --> 50:59.940\nEverything's real time now.\n\n50:59.940 --> 51:00.940\nTotally.\n\n51:00.940 --> 51:04.900\nEveryone's picking on people for how they fly or don't fly first class.\n\n51:04.900 --> 51:06.900\nYou don't have to...\n\n51:06.900 --> 51:08.700\nYeah, no, yeah.\n\n51:08.700 --> 51:14.100\nNo, it democratizes the process in a really cool way, which is what art should be about.\n\n51:14.100 --> 51:15.100\nHow did you guys meet?\n\n51:15.100 --> 51:16.100\nHow did you...\n\n51:16.100 --> 51:23.580\nWe were just in the back room there and I said, hey, I'm Rob, I'm in the show, and\n\n51:23.580 --> 51:24.580\nit's...\n\n51:24.580 --> 51:26.580\nKind of went from there.\n\n51:26.580 --> 51:28.180\nLook, I'm a straight shooter.\n\n51:28.180 --> 51:29.580\nI don't know her from Adam.\n\n51:29.580 --> 51:30.580\nNo.\n\n51:30.580 --> 51:31.580\nReally?\n\n51:31.580 --> 51:32.580\nNo.\n\n51:32.580 --> 51:33.580\nReally?\n\n51:33.580 --> 51:34.580\nYeah.\n\n51:34.580 --> 51:35.580\nNo matter.\n\n51:35.580 --> 51:36.580\nIt's a blind date.\n\n51:36.580 --> 51:37.580\nI love it.\n\n51:37.580 --> 51:38.580\nYeah.\n\n51:38.580 --> 51:39.580\nDid your husband know about this?\n\n51:39.580 --> 51:40.580\nHe's here.\n\n51:40.580 --> 51:41.580\nHe's into it.\n\n51:41.580 --> 51:42.580\nShh.\n\n51:42.580 --> 51:43.580\nNo, come.\n\n51:43.580 --> 51:44.580\nDon't.\n\n51:44.580 --> 51:45.580\nNow, is he the Jones?\n\n51:45.580 --> 51:46.580\nAnd you're the Lister?\n\n51:46.580 --> 51:47.580\nNo, no.\n\n51:47.580 --> 51:48.580\nMy mom's Lister and my dad's Jones.\n\n51:48.580 --> 51:49.580\nThey...\n\n51:49.580 --> 51:50.580\nMy mom didn't want to take my dad's name.\n\n51:50.580 --> 51:51.580\nI...\n\n51:51.580 --> 51:52.580\nThe whispers.\n\n51:52.580 --> 51:53.580\nIs your dad renowned in the industry?\n\n51:53.580 --> 51:54.580\nNo.\n\n51:54.580 --> 51:55.580\nNo.\n\n51:55.580 --> 51:56.580\nNo.\n\n51:56.580 --> 51:57.580\nThat's what I thought.\n\n51:57.580 --> 51:58.580\nNo.\n\n51:58.580 --> 51:59.580\nHis name is...\n\n51:59.580 --> 52:00.580\nNo.\n\n52:00.580 --> 52:01.580\nHis name is Bill Jones, which is a very common name.\n\n52:01.580 --> 52:02.580\nHe's a conceptual photographer in New York.\n\n52:02.580 --> 52:03.580\nOh.\n\n52:03.580 --> 52:04.580\nYeah.\n\n52:04.580 --> 52:05.580\nHe's renowned in that field.\n\n52:05.580 --> 52:06.580\nSure.\n\n52:06.580 --> 52:07.580\nIs he renowned or not?\n\n52:07.580 --> 52:08.580\nWhy'd you man to know?\n\n52:08.580 --> 52:11.580\nIs that like a qualification to be on this podcast?\n\n52:11.580 --> 52:12.580\nOne of your parents has to be renowned.\n\n52:12.580 --> 52:13.580\nYeah.\n\n52:13.580 --> 52:14.580\nWe have to be able to trace renownment.\n\n52:14.580 --> 52:17.580\nThat seems to actually be like a big deal.\n\n52:17.580 --> 52:18.580\nNo.\n\n52:18.580 --> 52:20.580\nThe truth is, remember when we had Colin Hanks on?\n\n52:20.580 --> 52:21.580\nWho's on my show?\n\n52:21.580 --> 52:22.580\nHe plays my husband on TV.\n\n52:22.580 --> 52:23.580\nYeah.\n\n52:23.580 --> 52:24.580\nSo, there you go.\n\n52:24.580 --> 52:25.580\nThat's the connection.\n\n52:25.580 --> 52:26.580\nI love men at work.\n\n52:26.580 --> 52:27.580\nThat's...\n\n52:27.580 --> 52:28.580\nAll right.\n\n52:28.580 --> 52:29.580\nAnyways.\n\n52:29.580 --> 52:30.580\nYou have a hard out...\n\n52:30.580 --> 52:31.580\nYou have a 4 a.m. call.\n\n52:31.580 --> 52:32.580\nI do.\n\n52:32.580 --> 52:33.580\nYeah.\n\n52:33.580 --> 52:34.580\nThat's Colin Hay.\n\n52:34.580 --> 52:36.580\nIt's criminal that you're here from the union standpoint.\n\n52:36.580 --> 52:37.580\nYeah.\n\n52:37.580 --> 52:38.580\nWhat?\n\n52:38.580 --> 52:39.580\nI could get arrested.\n\n52:39.580 --> 52:40.580\nColin Hay.\n\n52:40.580 --> 52:41.580\nWhat, Jeff?\n\n52:41.580 --> 52:42.580\nColin Hay is who you're thinking of.\n\n52:42.580 --> 52:43.580\nWhat?\n\n52:43.580 --> 52:46.580\nInto the mic, please.\n\n52:46.580 --> 52:47.580\nWhat?\n\n52:47.580 --> 52:50.580\nYou're thinking of Colin Hay.\n\n52:50.580 --> 52:51.580\nFor...\n\n52:51.580 --> 52:52.580\nMen at work.\n\n52:52.580 --> 52:53.580\nMen at what?\n\n52:53.580 --> 52:59.580\nRob and I are doing a sketch show at...\n\n52:59.580 --> 53:00.580\nRight now.\n\n53:00.580 --> 53:06.580\nYou have a 4 a.m. call here in town?\n\n53:06.580 --> 53:07.580\nNo.\n\n53:07.580 --> 53:08.580\nI have a 5 a.m. call.\n\n53:08.580 --> 53:09.580\nSo, I have to get up at like around 4.\n\n53:09.580 --> 53:10.580\nYeah.\n\n53:10.580 --> 53:17.580\nZoe Lister-Jones, to our handful of listeners that want to go find consumed...\n\n53:17.580 --> 53:18.580\nYeah.\n\n53:18.580 --> 53:21.580\nYou know, not to put you on the spot, but you know, here's your...\n\n53:21.580 --> 53:23.580\nTell them why to do it, I guess.\n\n53:23.580 --> 53:24.580\nOh, great.\n\n53:24.580 --> 53:25.580\nWhy?\n\n53:25.580 --> 53:26.580\nConsumeTheMovie.com.\n\n53:26.580 --> 53:27.580\nConsumeTheMovie.com.\n\n53:27.580 --> 53:28.580\nIt's cool.\n\n53:28.580 --> 53:33.080\nLike, harkens back to like, 70's thrillers where people talked about real shit that's\n\n53:33.080 --> 53:34.080\ngoing on in the world.\n\n53:34.080 --> 53:35.080\nWhere the bad guy was the environment.\n\n53:35.080 --> 53:36.580\nGMOs are some real shit, yeah.\n\n53:36.580 --> 53:37.580\nLike the prophecy.\n\n53:37.580 --> 53:38.580\nSure.\n\n53:38.580 --> 53:39.580\nYeah.\n\n53:39.580 --> 53:40.580\nNot the Christopher Lincoln one.\n\n53:40.580 --> 53:41.580\nThe prophecy with the guy.\n\n53:41.580 --> 53:42.580\nThe mutant there.\n\n53:42.580 --> 53:44.580\nOr like frogs with Sam Elliott.\n\n53:44.580 --> 53:45.580\nYes.\n\n53:45.580 --> 53:46.580\nAnd Ray Milland.\n\n53:46.580 --> 53:47.580\nAll right.\n\n53:47.580 --> 53:48.580\nSure.\n\n53:48.580 --> 53:49.580\nYeah.\n\n53:49.580 --> 53:50.580\nExactly like frogs.\n\n53:50.580 --> 53:52.580\nWith all due respect, I don't think we're going to see any of them again.\n\n53:52.580 --> 53:53.580\nNot alive, anyway.\n\n53:53.580 --> 53:57.580\nHey, Sam Elliott, do a commercial for Zoe Lister-Jones.\n\n53:57.580 --> 54:01.580\nOh, oh, God.\n\n54:01.580 --> 54:07.580\nIf you like Triscuits, well, I know exactly what to put on it.\n\n54:07.580 --> 54:08.580\nOh.\n\n54:08.580 --> 54:09.580\nShe's tall.\n\n54:09.580 --> 54:10.580\nShe's pale.\n\n54:10.580 --> 54:11.580\nI am pale.\n\n54:11.580 --> 54:12.580\nShe's lean.\n\n54:12.580 --> 54:13.580\nSure.\n\n54:13.580 --> 54:14.580\nShe may or may not wear socks.\n\n54:14.580 --> 54:15.580\nI can't tell.\n\n54:15.580 --> 54:16.580\nBut she...\n\n54:16.580 --> 54:17.580\nProbably like, yeah.\n\n54:17.580 --> 54:18.580\nThey're socks.\n\n54:18.580 --> 54:19.580\nThey're socks.\n\n54:19.580 --> 54:21.580\nShe hides her socks.\n\n54:21.580 --> 54:26.580\nBut she's not hiding a new movie called Consume.\n\n54:26.580 --> 54:30.580\nUnlike her socks, you can find that online at ConsumeTheMovie.com.\n\n54:30.580 --> 54:31.580\nAll right.\n\n54:31.580 --> 54:33.580\nZoe Lister-Jones, thanks for coming by.\n\n54:33.580 --> 54:34.580\nZoe Lister-Jones!\n\n54:34.580 --> 54:35.580\nGood luck.\n\n54:35.580 --> 54:36.580\nCome on.\n\n54:36.580 --> 54:37.580\nAll right.\n\n54:37.580 --> 54:48.580\nNow you can come up and sit up here.\n\n54:48.580 --> 54:55.580\nNot until you introduce me.\n\n54:55.580 --> 54:58.580\nI don't want him to not come to the show, but also it's just like, I want...\n\n54:58.580 --> 55:00.580\nHe's being petulant tonight.\n\n55:00.580 --> 55:01.580\nI was like...\n\n55:01.580 --> 55:04.580\nYou guys made me wait.\n\n55:04.580 --> 55:06.580\nI went to the bathroom twice.\n\n55:06.580 --> 55:07.580\nDan?\n\n55:07.580 --> 55:08.580\nOh, Dan.\n\n55:08.580 --> 55:09.580\nRob.\n\n55:09.580 --> 55:11.580\nThe headliner waits to come on last.\n\n55:11.580 --> 55:12.580\nLike, maybe we're saving you.\n\n55:12.580 --> 55:15.580\nYou want me to bring you up first and then in the middle of it?\n\n55:15.580 --> 55:16.580\nI've done that before.\n\n55:16.580 --> 55:17.580\nI've done that before.\n\n55:17.580 --> 55:18.580\nI've brought you up first.\n\n55:18.580 --> 55:19.580\nAnd then I've brought up some guy.\n\n55:19.580 --> 55:23.580\nI go like, oh, our next guest has like a weird feeling in his arm.\n\n55:23.580 --> 55:24.580\nAnd he's worried it might be serious.\n\n55:24.580 --> 55:25.580\nAnd then...\n\n55:25.580 --> 55:30.580\nAnd then it's like, you're fucking eating fucking peanuts and...\n\n55:30.580 --> 55:34.580\nIt's like, it becomes like a sketch and I'm like, I'm a...\n\n55:34.580 --> 55:36.580\nI've got nothing to do up there.\n\n55:36.580 --> 55:37.580\nI'm just sitting there.\n\n55:37.580 --> 55:39.580\nI'm just sitting there like a boob, man.\n\n55:39.580 --> 55:41.580\nI don't want to be a boob.\n\n55:41.580 --> 55:43.580\nI want to just sit in there, you know?\n\n55:43.580 --> 55:44.580\nAnd my back hurts.\n\n55:44.580 --> 55:45.580\nAnd I'm like...\n\n55:45.580 --> 55:48.580\nYeah, but you chose to sit in a weird...\n\n55:48.580 --> 55:49.580\nChair?\n\n55:49.580 --> 55:50.580\nVice principal.\n\n55:50.580 --> 55:54.580\nHow many chairs do you... there's not much of a selection.\n\n55:54.580 --> 55:58.580\nThat's the principal way of doing it is the most comfortable.\n\n55:58.580 --> 56:03.580\nOur next guest is popular with listeners.\n\n56:03.580 --> 56:16.580\nLet's welcome Rob from the side of the stage to the center of the stage, Rob Schrab.\n\n56:16.580 --> 56:33.580\nI think it's better for camera if you sit in one of the more central chairs.\n\n56:33.580 --> 56:37.580\nI think Jeff is way too low in this.\n\n56:37.580 --> 56:39.580\nI've been watching the monitor.\n\n56:39.580 --> 56:40.580\nYou're too low, man.\n\n56:40.580 --> 56:41.580\nYou need to be up.\n\n56:41.580 --> 56:42.580\nI think I have too much.\n\n56:42.580 --> 56:45.580\nThis is a big thing to get around.\n\n56:45.580 --> 56:47.580\nThere's a giant piece of furniture.\n\n56:47.580 --> 56:48.580\nThere's a leg thing.\n\n56:48.580 --> 56:50.580\nIf I sit here, I can't get my leg in there.\n\n56:50.580 --> 56:51.580\nRight.\n\n56:51.580 --> 56:52.580\nBecause there's a big drawer.\n\n56:52.580 --> 56:56.580\nWill you do something about this?\n\n56:56.580 --> 57:02.580\nIf this show required doing things about, I wouldn't be able to do it.\n\n57:02.580 --> 57:03.580\nI'm a busy man.\n\n57:03.580 --> 57:07.580\nOur logo would be up and not a peanut painting.\n\n57:07.580 --> 57:12.580\nBy the way, I was told this cost $1,400 not to throw it under the bus.\n\n57:12.580 --> 57:14.580\nIt's beautiful.\n\n57:14.580 --> 57:21.580\nI think it's interesting because when they said that to me, the painting directly behind\n\n57:21.580 --> 57:23.580\nyou cost $1,400.\n\n57:23.580 --> 57:27.580\nI was like, well, I assume all paintings are $1,400.\n\n57:27.580 --> 57:29.580\nIsn't that why people paint them?\n\n57:29.580 --> 57:34.580\nIn the time it took me to smear shit on a canvas, I'd make $1,400.\n\n57:34.580 --> 57:35.580\nToo far?\n\n57:35.580 --> 57:36.580\nOkay.\n\n57:36.580 --> 57:37.580\nAll right.\n\n57:37.580 --> 57:38.580\nHarmon lost them.\n\n57:38.580 --> 57:40.580\nSo you don't do a specific thing.\n\n57:40.580 --> 57:45.580\nYou're all a bunch of Hemingways.\n\n57:45.580 --> 57:46.580\nThe great painter.\n\n57:46.580 --> 57:48.580\nArt doesn't cost $1,400.\n\n57:48.580 --> 57:50.580\nWhat art cost $7,95?\n\n57:50.580 --> 57:54.580\nWhat art cost more than $70?\n\n57:54.580 --> 57:58.580\nDan, what's your favorite Hemingway painting, Dan?\n\n57:58.580 --> 58:08.580\nArt of how much does a Hemingway?\n\n58:08.580 --> 58:11.580\nLet's all watch this.\n\n58:11.580 --> 58:13.580\nPour that in the air.\n\n58:13.580 --> 58:18.580\nAfter Dan mentioned that the painting is expensive behind, Rob has moved closer to it.\n\n58:18.580 --> 58:20.580\nHe wants to block it.\n\n58:20.580 --> 58:23.580\nYeah, because it costs money to have it on the air.\n\n58:23.580 --> 58:26.580\nNo, because it's an artist getting attention.\n\n58:26.580 --> 58:28.580\nThat is true.\n\n58:28.580 --> 58:30.580\nAnd because it costs $1,400.\n\n58:30.580 --> 58:34.580\nI don't think I've ever gotten $1,400 for anything I draw.\n\n58:34.580 --> 58:38.580\nHave you ever done canvases like acrylics or oils or anything, Rob?\n\n58:38.580 --> 58:41.580\nMaybe in high school.\n\n58:41.580 --> 58:43.580\nWould you do one tonight?\n\n58:43.580 --> 58:44.580\nYes.\n\n58:44.580 --> 58:45.580\nOkay.\n\n58:45.580 --> 58:46.580\nAll right.\n\n58:46.580 --> 58:47.580\nSorry.\n\n58:47.580 --> 58:49.580\nI'm not doing a good job tonight.\n\n58:49.580 --> 58:50.580\nNo.\n\n58:50.580 --> 58:52.580\nAnd I'm not ashamed.\n\n58:52.580 --> 58:54.580\nAll right.\n\n58:54.580 --> 58:55.580\nRob.\n\n58:55.580 --> 59:03.580\nWhat was your favorite sketch?\n\n59:03.580 --> 59:10.580\nWhen I first met Rob and Dan, I walked into a comedy sports improv festival tournament\n\n59:10.580 --> 59:12.580\nin Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n59:12.580 --> 59:13.580\nDon't do this.\n\n59:13.580 --> 59:19.580\nAnd I had heard that there was a couple of famous, like, squads, teams.\n\n59:19.580 --> 59:20.580\nEthan, are you filming the whole thing?\n\n59:20.580 --> 59:21.580\nNo, the whole thing.\n\n59:21.580 --> 59:23.580\nOh, he's got his camera up the whole time.\n\n59:23.580 --> 59:27.580\nIt's cheaper than paying for it.\n\n59:27.580 --> 59:29.580\nBut he paid to get it.\n\n59:29.580 --> 59:31.580\nIt's more expensive to sit where he's sitting.\n\n59:31.580 --> 59:34.580\nHe's got twice as much to get into the show.\n\n59:34.580 --> 59:36.580\nAll right.\n\n59:36.580 --> 59:38.580\nAll right.\n\n59:38.580 --> 59:41.580\nI had heard that the New York team was the Bert Firstners.\n\n59:41.580 --> 59:46.580\nLike, those guys were supposed to be like, oh, I came from the LA team, which is, you\n\n59:46.580 --> 59:47.580\nknow, hodgepodge of people.\n\n59:47.580 --> 59:52.580\nAnd I was one of the couple younger, like the whippersnappers on the team.\n\n59:52.580 --> 59:53.580\nRight.\n\n59:53.580 --> 59:56.580\nBut the Milwaukee team had the sketch group, a side group called the Dead Alewives.\n\n59:56.580 --> 01:00:00.580\nAnd that included Rob and Dan and several others.\n\n01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:03.580\nAnd the Bert Firstners were the side group of the New York team.\n\n01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:07.580\nSo I came into a festival very freaked out and nervous because I'd only done comedy\n\n01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.580\nsports, I think, you know, eight times or something like that.\n\n01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.580\nI mean, you know, not that many times.\n\n01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.580\n9-11.\n\n01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.580\n9-11.\n\n01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:15.580\nOkay.\n\n01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.580\nWait.\n\n01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.580\nCan you put a pin?\n\n01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.580\nYeah.\n\n01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.580\nYou got to put a pin.\n\n01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.580\nOkay.\n\n01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:21.580\nPin.\n\n01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:28.580\nI texted Bob Saget because I had a picture on my watch of Bob Saget's face because it came\n\n01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.580\nup.\n\n01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:30.580\nI'll put a picture on your watch to begin with.\n\n01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.580\nI'll explain that in a second.\n\n01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.580\nOkay.\n\n01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:37.580\nBut there was a, my Apple Watch, when its software got updated, allowed you to have a photo\n\n01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.580\nas the watch face.\n\n01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.580\nWow.\n\n01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:42.580\nAt 9-11 in the morning.\n\n01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:43.580\nThat's great.\n\n01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.580\nI know.\n\n01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.580\nLeaps and bounds.\n\n01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.580\nYeah.\n\n01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.580\nI went like this one morning, two days, three days ago.\n\n01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:54.060\nAnd Bob Saget's face came up and it said 9-11.\n\n01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:58.580\nAnd I very quickly took a photo of it and I tweeted it to you.\n\n01:00:58.580 --> 01:00:59.580\nYeah.\n\n01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.580\nI saw that.\n\n01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.580\nFor obvious reasons.\n\n01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.580\nSpencer.\n\n01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:05.580\nHe's part of the family.\n\n01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:12.580\nJustin Roiland, who is the one who took a picture of Bob Saget's face from the cover\n\n01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.580\nof, I think, People.\n\n01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.580\nAnd that's why you selected that as your...\n\n01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:19.580\nYeah.\n\n01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.580\nEverybody had a reason.\n\n01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.580\nAnd Bob Saget.\n\n01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.580\nI sent it to Bob Saget as well because it's Bob Saget.\n\n01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.580\nAre you guys palsy lousy?\n\n01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.580\nNo.\n\n01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.580\nNo.\n\n01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.580\nI don't know him.\n\n01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.580\nI saw that.\n\n01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:34.580\nHalfway through the day, Bob Saget tweeted.\n\n01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:38.580\nHe responded and said, I am honored.\n\n01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:44.580\nAnd then he did a bit about like, you're probably the only person that wants to look at my face\n\n01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:46.580\nin the morning or something like that.\n\n01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.580\nAnd everybody was like, Bob Saget tweeted you back.\n\n01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.580\nAnd I was like, oh, that's great.\n\n01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:52.580\nWhere is that?\n\n01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.580\nI'm going to retweet his tweeting.\n\n01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:56.580\nAnd I scrolled it.\n\n01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.580\nAnd I was like, where is it?\n\n01:01:58.580 --> 01:01:59.580\nWhat happened?\n\n01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:00.580\nWhere did it go?\n\n01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:01.580\nHe took it down.\n\n01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.580\nAnd then everybody was like, wait, wait, what is it?\n\n01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:04.580\nYeah.\n\n01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.580\nNo, it was him.\n\n01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.580\nWas it a fake account?\n\n01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.580\nNo, it wasn't.\n\n01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.580\nHe deleted it.\n\n01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:11.580\nHe deleted it because...\n\n01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.580\nBecause he realized after the fact that he was...\n\n01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.580\nThat it was a 9-11 joke.\n\n01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:16.580\nYeah.\n\n01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.580\nHe saw his face and didn't see 9-11.\n\n01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.580\nThen later on he goes, oh.\n\n01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:26.580\nAnd so now it's that I told...\n\n01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:29.580\nYeah, I just...\n\n01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.580\nIt makes me hate him, right?\n\n01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:37.580\nDoesn't it make you hate a person?\n\n01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.580\nHate might be coming a little hard.\n\n01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:44.580\nWell, like, I mean, it doesn't make you love him, does it?\n\n01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.580\nYeah.\n\n01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:49.580\nWell, also, he's famous for having one of the bluest, most dark, dirty stand-ups in the\n\n01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:50.580\nworld.\n\n01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.580\nI'm honored.\n\n01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:55.580\nAnd I was like, okay, that's glib and stuff, but it was like...\n\n01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.580\nMaybe he is a big...\n\n01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:02.580\nLike, he works for a major first responder's charity or something like that.\n\n01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.580\nWhat if one of his family died in 9-11?\n\n01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.580\nYeah.\n\n01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.580\nDoes it know for a fact that he was the one who deleted it?\n\n01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.580\nWhat do you mean, sir?\n\n01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.580\nYou think somebody else runs Bob Sagg?\n\n01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.580\nIt's like Twitter?\n\n01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:14.580\nNo, because you tweeted it.\n\n01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.580\nOh, you're saying he deleted it on his...\n\n01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.580\nYeah, no, yeah.\n\n01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.580\nThe tweet was deleted.\n\n01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:19.580\nYeah.\n\n01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:24.580\nThere's a manic depressive in the front row.\n\n01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:28.580\nRather than explain everything you asked, it's the quickest way.\n\n01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.580\nThere's a crazy person.\n\n01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:38.580\nHe's got Kleenex boxes on his feet and a dog skull around his chest.\n\n01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:41.580\nDid you fire back at Saggit about this?\n\n01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.580\nNo, but I sent a photo.\n\n01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:49.580\nI had Justin because at 9-11 p.m., there was a...\n\n01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:50.580\nJustin tweeted it.\n\n01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:51.580\nLet's all do it every day now.\n\n01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:52.580\nLet's just make that a thing.\n\n01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.580\nThat's what I started thinking.\n\n01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:56.580\nHe's like, maybe it could be a thing, but then I forgot about it.\n\n01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:00.580\nI mean, I would say if you want to, just if you're listening, if you want to...\n\n01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:01.580\nBut I think...\n\n01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:05.580\nI guess maybe someone from Netflix called him and said, knock it off.\n\n01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.580\nKnock it off.\n\n01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.580\nHe said, what?\n\n01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:08.580\nNo, I laughed.\n\n01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.580\nIt's great.\n\n01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.580\nHe's like, that's a 9-11 joke.\n\n01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580\nLook at the time.\n\n01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.580\nYou narcissist.\n\n01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.580\nLook at the number above your head.\n\n01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:24.580\nBut I think it makes me feel like maybe he had something to do with 9-11.\n\n01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.580\nBecause why would you...\n\n01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.580\nYeah, because the statute of limitations still hasn't run out on that.\n\n01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:30.580\nRight.\n\n01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.580\nHe was like, what have you found?\n\n01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.580\nSaggit's still under investigation because I know he was for a while.\n\n01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.580\nI don't know.\n\n01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.580\nI think he's eluded it.\n\n01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.580\nYeah.\n\n01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.580\nAnd I think questions need to be raised.\n\n01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.580\nI think this might go all the way to the top.\n\n01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:44.580\nIt starts with the people associating his face with 9-11.\n\n01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.580\nI'll tell you that.\n\n01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:47.580\nAnyways.\n\n01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.580\nI'm...\n\n01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.580\nAll right.\n\n01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.580\nPlease, one of you was talking and now talk more.\n\n01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.580\nYou were telling a story.\n\n01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:57.580\nI was saying that I walked into a room and I saw...\n\n01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.580\nIt was like the first night I was there at Milwaukee Comedy Sports and there was a sketch\n\n01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.580\nhappening called The Dead Ale Wives and you two were on stage.\n\n01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.580\nAnd what would...\n\n01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.580\nWe would have been what, 25, 6, 7, 8, like around that age?\n\n01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.580\nI was 24.\n\n01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.580\nYou're probably three years old, right?\n\n01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:13.580\nYes.\n\n01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.580\nYeah.\n\n01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.580\nAnd so they were up there doing it and I sat down there and I sat in the back and I was\n\n01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.580\ncompletely bummed out because I was like, these guys are...\n\n01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:20.580\nThese guys are renegade.\n\n01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:23.580\nThese guys are out there and like crazy and stuff like that.\n\n01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:26.580\nAnd then I wouldn't like talk to you guys because I was too afraid of you guys.\n\n01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.580\nWe all kind of found like we all ended up hanging out.\n\n01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:29.580\nBut do you guys remember...\n\n01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:32.580\nWas there a sketch, an Ale Wives sketch that was the two of you?\n\n01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:36.580\nDid you guys have like a Burton, Ernie, Abbott and Costello kind of...\n\n01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:40.580\nWe had a Fred and Barney one that was pretty accurate.\n\n01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:41.580\nWhat was it?\n\n01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:42.580\nWhat was that?\n\n01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.580\nThat was just like a post-apocalyptic Flintstone.\n\n01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:46.580\nFred and Barney.\n\n01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.580\nYeah.\n\n01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:48.580\nYou were Fred, of course.\n\n01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.580\nBut probably not funny, right?\n\n01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.580\nOh, no.\n\n01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.580\nNone of those was funny.\n\n01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:54.580\nSo, yeah.\n\n01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:56.580\nI mean, it's not like the dead parrot.\n\n01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:57.580\nWe're not going to do anything.\n\n01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.580\nOkay.\n\n01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.580\nIt's not going to be funny.\n\n01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.580\nI mean, I don't remember any...\n\n01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.580\nI mean, like a post-apocalyptic...\n\n01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:02.580\nKind of drunk.\n\n01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:03.580\nYeah.\n\n01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.580\nWe're all very drunk.\n\n01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.580\nI'm not saying...\n\n01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:09.580\nI wasn't trying to pin you to pull out

The clouds rain on our parade.\n\n01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:19.560\nWe have a parade? That's how we make power.\n\n01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:23.560\nWe've looked at them from both sides now. From up and down and still somehow.\n\n01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:27.560\nCloud illusions, I recall. I really don't know clouds at all.\n\n01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:31.560\nOh!\n\n01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.560\nJoni Mitchell reference. Oh!\n\n01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.560\nThe clouds in rain!\n\n01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:43.560\nYou can command the clouds. Make the rain go away.\n\n01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:47.560\nI'd like to go home.\n\n01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.560\nAnd I find you racist.\n\n01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:55.560\nAre you refusing this call?\n\n01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:59.560\nWait, we are only an act one?\n\n01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:03.560\nIt's a flashback. What did you want?\n\n01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.560\nLook.\n\n01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.560\nI am. Okay. Then I guess I can't\n\n01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.560\npersuade you to stay.\n\n01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:19.560\nCan I go home? No!\n\n01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:23.560\nYes. Where do I go?\n\n01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:27.560\nHe wants to know where to go.\n\n01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.560\nThrough the clouds. I'll find it.\n\n01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.560\nI'm not even listening to you. Through the clouds.\n\n01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:39.560\nWait! I can only go back so far.\n\n01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.560\nYou have a button open on your shirt.\n\n01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:55.560\nFat shaming.\n\n01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:59.560\nIt gets cold up there. You might want a button on your shirt.\n\n01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:03.560\nAll the way to the bottom.\n\n01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:07.560\nNo one's looking.\n\n01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:11.560\nYou can button your shirt now.\n\n01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:15.560\nJust go ahead. One button.\n\n01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:19.560\nNo one will judge you.\n\n01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:23.560\nYou have been blocked.\n\n01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:27.560\nThe power\n\n01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.560\nof the button.\n\n01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.560\nUse this power well.\n\n01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:47.560\nI will.\n\n01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.560\nAnything else while I'm up?\n\n01:26:51.560 --> 01:27:03.560\nI'm going back to my office.\n\n01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:07.560\nHe's the top of a beanstalk.\n\n01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:19.560\nPut it out of your mind.\n\n01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.560\nI don't.\n\n01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:27.560\nOkay.\n\n01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.560\nMost climbing my spine.\n\n01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:35.560\nI'm...\n\n01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:39.560\nI am...\n\n01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.560\nWho is I am?\n\n01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:47.560\nWait! Don't go!\n\n01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:51.560\nIt's fun up here.\n\n01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:55.560\nYou're not even going to try?\n\n01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.560\nI said to try.\n\n01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:03.560\nI know where you are and you sound like a sheep.\n\n01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:07.560\nI'm up above you. You're climbing my vine.\n\n01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:11.560\nThank you for letting me climb it. My name is Dan Harmon. I've been through a lot today.\n\n01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:19.560\nI'm just trying to get down from the cloud world.\n\n01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.560\nBeyond that, I can't really remember.\n\n01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:27.560\nIf you want to get down, that's easy.\n\n01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:31.560\nI can't.\n\n01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.560\nNo!\n\n01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.560\nHello!\n\n01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:47.560\nHello?\n\n01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.560\nHello?\n\n01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:55.560\nHello.\n\n01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:03.560\nHello. Welcome. Welcome to Andromeda Strain.\n\n01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:17.560\nThese are the special extras of Michael Crichton's Andromeda Strain.\n\n01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:25.560\nWould you like to see a BTS of Andromeda Strain?\n\n01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.560\nAnd how they did it?\n\n01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.560\nYes, press play.\n\n01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:48.560\nHi, I'm Michael Crichton. You know what's weird? Science.\n\n01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:54.560\nScience is strange. Freaks me out. I can't sleep at night.\n\n01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:59.560\nMy wife gets pissed off at me, so I write these books.\n\n01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:04.560\nI don't know. What do you do to get over your problems?\n\n01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:17.560\nAnyway, I wrote this story called Andromeda Strain about a person named Andromeda who is just like going under a tremendous difficulty in his life.\n\n01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:23.560\nJust a lot of strain in his life and he's trying to figure out what's going on.\n\n01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:31.560\nThis is the worst. I'm going to watch the original theatrical trailer.\n\n01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:40.560\n20th Century Fox proudly presents Michael Crichton's Andromeda Strain.\n\n01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:47.560\nAre you kidding me? These goats can't fly?\n\n01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:53.560\nThey don't. Someone else's will. Andromeda Strain.\n\n01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:59.560\nYour lab results are inaccurate. Your personality is inaccurate too.\n\n01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:06.560\nAndromeda Strain. I can't feel my passion. Why don't you feel my dick?\n\n01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:12.560\nAndromeda Strain. The Chinese are everywhere.\n\n01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:17.560\nTell him to button his button.\n\n01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:24.560\nAndromeda Strain. Run like you've got a pair.\n\n01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:30.560\nI'll just... I'll follow what in heaven. Hello beyond there.\n\n01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:34.560\nAndromeda. Andromeda, you're fired.\n\n01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.560\nStrain.\n\n01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:41.560\nStrain. Thanksgiving.\n\n01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:00.560\nStrain just got a new first name name.\n\n01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:05.560\nThat was good.\n\n01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.560\nOur biggest fan just walked out.\n\n01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:18.560\nShe's had a lot to drink. She's a Hillary voter.\n\n01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:23.560\nBullshit. I'm done with this.\n\n01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.560\nI've had enough of this bullshit. I'm going to take a piss.\n\n01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:31.560\nMonica, don't. I'm going to take a piss right now.\n\n01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.560\nWe're watching the Andromeda Strain, right? You and I?\n\n01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.560\nNo, I'm taking a piss.\n\n01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.560\nOkay, but I'm just being... I mean...\n\n01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:43.560\nI'm taking a piss.\n\n01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.560\nHey, Monica.\n\n01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.560\nYes?\n\n01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:51.560\nGo ahead and piss, but I wanted to talk to you through the closed bathroom door.\n\n01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:53.560\nWelcome this way.\n\n01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:57.560\nWe can't just keep doing this, right?\n\n01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:02.560\nLet's go back to talking about politics.\n\n01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:04.560\nOh, no, okay. Anyway.\n\n01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.560\nI can't do that. You know that.\n\n01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:09.560\nWell, now you spoiled it.\n\n01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:11.560\nYeah.\n\n01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:13.560\nI thought that's what you like to do. I'm just trying to make you happy.\n\n01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.560\nI did it.\n\n01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.560\nI tried talking to women about women.\n\n01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.560\nYou're haunting the place like Phantom of the Opera.\n\n01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.560\nYou're leaving? You're going to make Lego movies?\n\n01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.560\nI want to know more about that beanstalk goat.\n\n01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:29.560\nWas he like a guardian of the beanstalk?\n\n01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:39.560\nI pictured him as some kind of doctor snuggles kind of creature with a long vine growing out of his chin.\n\n01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.560\nOh, so the vine didn't grow out of the ground.\n\n01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:45.560\nIt's actually dangling from the chin of a giant cosmic goat.\n\n01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:47.560\nRight.\n\n01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:49.560\nThat's cool. There's your movie.\n\n01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:51.560\nCosmic goat.\n\n01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:53.560\nCosmic goat.\n\n01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:56.560\nAll right. Well, what did we learn tonight?\n\n01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.560\nHere, we'll do a role-playing thing, but I'll be Spencer.\n\n01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.560\nAll right. Let's do it.\n\n01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.560\nDo you have a game platform for us or are you going to freestyle it?\n\n01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:08.560\nWe're going to play laser.\n\n01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:10.560\nWait, that's already used comedically.\n\n01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.560\nWe're going to play gamma world.\n\n01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:15.560\nGamma world.\n\n01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:16.560\nGamma world.\n\n01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:18.560\nGamma potato.\n\n01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:20.560\nLet's play cosmic goat.\n\n01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:23.560\nAll right. Here we go.\n\n01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:26.560\nDan, do you want some Spencer theme music to start us off here?\n\n01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.560\nAll right. Let's see what I got here.\n\n01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:31.560\nCosmic goat.\n\n01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:33.560\nHere we go.\n\n01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:37.560\nIn the world of gamma potato,\n\n01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:44.560\nthe world is older than you've ever known.\n\n01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:46.560\nGive me a second.\n\n01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:48.560\nI'm glad you could join us.\n\n01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:54.560\nPotatoes are the only thing that seems overtly comical.\n\n01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.560\nI don't want to do that, the potato thing.\n\n01:34:58.560 --> 01:34:59.560\nIt seems like the piranha 3D thing.\n\n01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.560\nIt's like, I don't want to play it.\n\n01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.560\nGamma world.\n\n01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:07.560\nAll right. We'll just make it a regular.\n\n01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:09.560\nShadow run.\n\n01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.560\nReality.\n\n01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.560\nNo, real.\n\n01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:15.560\nGive me a second.\n\n01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.560\nSuper. No, no, no.\n\n01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.560\nI can beat that.\n\n01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:21.560\nNo.\n\n01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:24.560\nChrist wars.\n\n01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.560\nAll right.\n\n01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.560\nNow I'm in.\n\n01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.560\nI got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Okay.\n\n01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.560\nI will be the cross of ice.\n\n01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.560\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:39.560\nLet him set it up for us.\n\n01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:41.560\nI won't.\n\n01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:43.560\nI'm going to let you make your characters in a second.\n\n01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:45.560\nOkay.\n\n01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.560\nThe two of you have just woken up in a featureless room.\n\n01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:52.560\nSix feet by six feet.\n\n01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.560\nA sealed door, although you don't know it's sealed yet,\n\n01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:00.560\nis on each wall for a total of four doors.\n\n01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:04.560\nYou are both naked, save for a light loincloth.\n\n01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:08.560\nYou have holes in your hands and feet.\n\n01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:14.560\nYou look the same except for certain distinguishing tattoos\n\n01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.560\non your right and or left biceps.\n\n01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.560\nThis is your time to introduce yourselves to each other\n\n01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:26.560\nas you wake up on the floor of this featureless room.\n\n01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.560\nJeff, it's your turn.\n\n01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:33.560\nWhat's up?\n\n01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.560\nMy name is...\n\n01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:42.560\nJesus.\n\n01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.560\nRob, your character is perceiving a person standing next to you\n\n01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:53.560\nsaying these things to you and he's just saying these things.\n\n01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.560\nI have a tattoo of an olive branch on my right bicep.\n\n01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.560\nI see you have one on your left bicep.\n\n01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:02.560\nYes, I do.\n\n01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:04.560\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:06.560\nJesus.\n\n01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:12.560\nRob, you feel a burning sensation in your head.\n\n01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.560\nYeah.\n\n01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.560\nYour ancestors are saying to you in the form of a cat.\n\n01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:20.560\nYou see a cat in front of you with his wreath in flame\n\n01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:22.560\nand he says, don't do that.\n\n01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:24.560\nJust don't do that.\n\n01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.560\nDon't do that.\n\n01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:28.560\nYou take 12 damage.\n\n01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.560\nI should tell you guys there's a series of lights\n\n01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.560\nin the corners of each corner.\n\n01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:44.560\nThere's a blue light alternately symmetrical with a red light\n\n01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:47.560\nand a yellow light and it's alternating pattern going across\n\n01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:51.560\nin the form of like a reverse cross, like a Mercedes symbol\n\n01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:56.560\nbut like flipping back and forth as each time the ceiling rotates\n\n01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:00.560\nthere's a red, yellow light and a blue light and then a green light.\n\n01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.560\nIn the center of the room there's an orange crystal.\n\n01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.560\nI pick up the cat and using my unarmed combat...\n\n01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.560\nYou can't pick up a cat.\n\n01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.560\nYou can't pick up a cat.\n\n01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.560\nHow do you pick up a cat?\n\n01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.560\nI have plus 22 agility.\n\n01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.560\nYou don't see a cat.\n\n01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:21.560\nThere's no cat there to your knowledge.\n\n01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.560\nWasn't there a cat telling him what to do?\n\n01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:27.560\nRob's cat is like, you don't know.\n\n01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.560\nIt's a hallucinatory cat.\n\n01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:35.560\nI use unarmed combat and I frontal kick Jesus right in the chest.\n\n01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.560\nAh, fuck, ow.\n\n01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:40.560\nHe's just...\n\n01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.560\nDie for my sense.\n\n01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:47.560\nYou've received 17 damages, his foot caves into your sternum\n\n01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.560\nand his heel sinks into your sternum.\n\n01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:52.560\nJesus.\n\n01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.560\nThat's my name.\n\n01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.560\nThe two of you are in a very strange situation at this point.\n\n01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.560\nThe ceiling starts to unscrew like a cork,\n\n01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.560\nlike a cap on a cork bottle\n\n01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.560\nand it goes up as it spins around\n\n01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:13.560\nand it goes up and a giant character says,\n\n01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.560\nI want to talk to you about being God.\n\n01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.560\nYou look up and you see a character.\n\n01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.560\nHis head is the size of Pluto.\n\n01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.560\nHis eyes are each planets.\n\n01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.560\nHis mouth talks with a giant cave-like venom.\n\n01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:37.560\nI look up and he says, I want the ruby of Francocon\n\n01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:40.560\nand I'll stop it, nothing to get it.\n\n01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:45.560\nHe creates a wreath of flame and if that flame dies out,\n\n01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.560\nyou need to save versus burning.\n\n01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.560\nYou both fail to save versus burning.\n\n01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:53.560\nI haven't had a turn yet.\n\n01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:55.560\nYou're both on fire right now.\n\n01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:57.560\nI am on fire.\n\n01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.560\nI haven't had a turn yet.\n\n01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.560\nI have trap sense.\n\n01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.560\nDid you roll my trap sense?\n\n01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:07.560\nYou sense that there are such a thing as traps in the universe.\n\n01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.560\nGood one.\n\n01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:13.560\nVorthamama Khan says, I'm going to do this.\n\n01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.560\nHis hand comes out and it's the size of 8 million worlds.\n\n01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.560\nYou're all being pulled into it.\n\n01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:22.560\nYou're all inside a giant hand.\n\n01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:26.560\nA finger comes inside that hand and you open a door\n\n01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:29.560\non the tip of that finger and you go into that finger.\n\n01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:31.560\nNow you're inside a big black space\n\n01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.560\nand there's an orange dot in the northwest corner,\n\n01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.560\na green dot 5 meters from that,\n\n01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.560\nanother orange dot in the center of the ceiling.\n\n01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:44.560\nThe whole thing is shaped like an egg but with a pyramid on top of it,\n\n01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:47.560\nthere's two lights that flash in this order.\n\n01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:50.560\nGreen, green, red, red, green, green, blue\n\n01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:54.560\nand there's a cash register in the center of the room\n\n01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:56.560\ndoing a Pokemon reference.\n\n01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.560\nI turn to his citizens and say, I know this one.\n\n01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.560\nWhy did you kick me so hard?\n\n01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.560\nBecause it's Christ wars but I realized just after this whole thing happened\n\n01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:10.560\nwe had to find the ruby of Demorja Khan.\n\n01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.560\nCan I have my clothes back?\n\n01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.560\nI give you back your loincloth under one condition,\n\n01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.560\nthat we work together to defeat...\n\n01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:22.560\nYou kicked me in the chest and took my clothes.\n\n01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:24.560\nBecause it's Christ wars.\n\n01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.560\nWork together?\n\n01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:27.560\nNow we're working together.\n\n01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:30.560\nYou're telling me to work together after you kicked me in the chest\n\n01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.560\nand took my clothes.\n\n01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.560\nTurn the other chest and let's work together.\n\n01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.560\nWhile you guys are talking, the sky is crushing you.\n\n01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:46.560\nI reach into my butt and I pull out a ruby.\n\n01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.560\nOkay, you do that.\n\n01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:50.560\nThat happens.\n\n01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:52.560\nI hold in a loft.\n\n01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.560\nI still haven't had a turn.\n\n01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.560\nYou've had like nine turns.\n\n01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:58.560\nThis is free action stuff.\n\n01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:00.560\nWe're not in combat really, I don't think.\n\n01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:05.560\nOkay, I push you over, take the ruby, give it to him and leave.\n\n01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:07.560\nI just did that.\n\n01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.560\nIt just happened.\n\n01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.560\nIt happened.\n\n01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:13.560\nIt just happened.\n\n01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:15.560\nChrist war has been declared.\n\n01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:17.560\nI'm walking home.\n\n01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:24.560\nThe blackness folds around you, both of you feel like sandwiches inside a toaster.\n\n01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:26.560\nThere's blackness around you.\n\n01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:30.560\nYou can't move or speak for the next seven and a half minutes.\n\n01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:33.560\nThe eternity is keeping you from doing anything.\n\n01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:35.560\nI cast toaster speech.\n\n01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.560\nI cast toaster speech.\n\n01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:45.560\nOkay, you do that.\n\n01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:48.560\nNothing happens.\n\n01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:53.560\nBlackness continues to surround you.\n\n01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:56.560\nEternity moves into night.\n\n01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:00.560\nRed lights become blue lights and you move into a new realm.\n\n01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:04.560\nYou look around you, it looks like there's a yellow world.\n\n01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.560\nIt's all yellow, everything's yellow.\n\n01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:11.560\nIf you look around and it's yellow and there's flowers and it feels very yellow.\n\n01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:15.560\nAnd a guy comes up to you and goes like, hey, can I get you a pack?\n\n01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:17.560\nMan?\n\n01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.560\nI'll take a pack.\n\n01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.560\nCan we talk now?\n\n01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:24.560\nYou guys are taking damage.\n\n01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.560\nI'll take one pack.\n\n01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:29.560\nOh, okay, you get healed for a thousand points.\n\n01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:31.560\nThank you.\n\n01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.560\nOh, shit, I'm all healed.\n\n01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:38.560\nFuck, one of my holes is totally healed.\n\n01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.560\nAre there any exits available to me?\n\n01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.560\nThere are two exits, everything's an exit.\n\n01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.560\nI take both of them.\n\n01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.560\nTechnically speaking, everything's an exit.\n\n01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.560\nEverything's an exit.\n\n01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:01.560\nAm I still just wearing a loincloth?\n\n01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:06.560\nYou don't wear a loincloth, it's a loincloth, it's around your loins.\n\n01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:08.560\nOkay.\n\n01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.560\nIs the God figure the second?\n\n01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:13.560\nIs he visible?\n\n01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:17.560\nThe God isn't a figure, there's a God or a figure.\n\n01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:18.560\nOkay.\n\n01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:27.560\nI use arcane knowledge to read the surroundings.\n\n01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:29.560\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.560\nTell me what you're doing.\n\n01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:36.560\nWhat arcane knowledge are you speaking of?\n\n01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:41.560\nJust to see if I can read the runes or anything on the walls or anything.\n\n01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:44.560\nOkay, a serpent is eating you.\n\n01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.560\nA serpent is eating you.\n\n01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.560\nAs it sinks its teeth into you.\n\n01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:55.560\nI cast Christ-like surrender and let him eat me.\n\n01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:04.560\nI push his head into the mouth of the snake.\n\n01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:06.560\nI help him, I help him.\n\n01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:08.560\nAnd I say to the snake, I'm being eaten.\n\n01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:13.560\nBy doing this, I will be sitting at the right hand of my father after you digest me.\n\n01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:17.560\nI help him, I'm pushing as hard as I can.\n\n01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:20.560\nI negate my own ego and my five senses.\n\n01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:25.560\nI attain apotheosis and I transcend.\n\n01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:27.560\nI'm pushing him into that.\n\n01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:29.560\nThat happens.\n\n01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.560\nYou all do everything that you just described.\n\n01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.560\nAnd as the mouth opens up, you see a sunrise coming up over an orange field.\n\n01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.560\nOh, that's so beautiful.\n\n01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:42.560\nI love it.\n\n01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.560\nA lone black figure bounds up, but he has a horn on his head.\n\n01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:49.560\nAnd he says, I'll give you whatever you want.\n\n01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:52.560\nMy name's Nabisco.\n\n01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:55.560\nNabisco?\n\n01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:57.560\nDo you have any triscuits?\n\n01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.560\nI have lots of triscuits.\n\n01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:03.560\nNabisco? Can I have a triscuit?\n\n01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.560\nWhat's your dexterity?\n\n01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:10.560\nYou're dying.\n\n01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:12.560\nI don't care.\n\n01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:13.560\nYou're dead.\n\n01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:15.560\nI don't care.\n\n01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:16.560\nYou're dead.\n\n01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:17.560\nI am.\n\n01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:18.560\nThat

too.\n\n01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:27.560\nYou're so dead, man.\n\n01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:28.560\nNo, I'm not.\n\n01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.560\nRight hand of snake god, I'm looking at you.\n\n01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.560\nYou're in heaven.\n\n01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:32.560\nI'm looking at a dead guy.\n\n01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:33.560\nThis is the best place ever.\n\n01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:34.560\nNo, that's not possible.\n\n01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:35.560\nYeah, it is.\n\n01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:36.560\nNo.\n\n01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:37.560\nYou just got creep showed.\n\n01:46:37.560

Pepper, sir?\n\n01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:47.560\nYou fucking can't.\n\n01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:48.560\nYou fucking...\n\n01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.560\nMake an order.\n\n01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.560\nYou're fucking clogging up the queue.\n\n01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.560\nThere's 18 cars behind you.\n\n01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:54.560\nOh, fucking day.\n\n01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.560\nI

01:47:05.560\nI was a dungeon master.\n\n01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:07.560\nA master.\n\n01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.560\nYeah.\n\n01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:09.560\nYeah, right.\n\n01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:10.560\nSure you were.\n\n01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.560\nAnd I'm Jackie Robinson.\n\n01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.560\nYou are.\n\n01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:16.560\nYou are Jackie Robinson.\n\n01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.560\nOh.\n\n01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:18.560\nAnd you.\n\n01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:21.560\nYou're that retarded boy I saved from that coal mine.\n\n01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.560\nEveryone in this room.\n\n01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.560\nEveryone in this room is from a previous episode of the show that I star in,\n\n01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:31.560\nwhere I leap from life to life.\n\n01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.560\nThere's only one explanation.\n\n01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.560\nThis is heaven.\n\n01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:40.560\nThis is heaven.\n\n01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.560\nI doubted for me to put you out.\n\n01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.560\nIt's heaven.\n\n01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:50.560\nI go to the bathroom.\n\n01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:52.560\nYou walk into the bathroom.\n\n01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.560\nThe bathroom has three toilets.\n\n01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.560\nOne toilet is green.\n\n01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:58.560\nOne toilet is a lighter green.\n\n01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:01.560\nOne toilet is like a sea foam green.\n\n01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.560\nThere's no line in the heavenly bathroom.\n\n01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560\nPlease, this way.\n\n01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:06.560\nLet me open it.\n\n01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.560\nGive me your hand.\n\n01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:14.560\nUse the three seashells and go to the bathroom.\n\n01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:17.560\nYou guys are doing two different bits.\n\n01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:22.560\nIn heaven, bits are in tandem.\n\n01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:26.560\nI go to the bathroom.\n\n01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:27.560\nYou do that.\n\n01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:28.560\nI make a pee.\n\n01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:30.560\nYou make a pee.\n\n01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:32.560\nI use the three seashells.\n\n01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.560\nWhich one do you use?\n\n01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.560\nThe third one.\n\n01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:37.560\nThe sea foam green one?\n\n01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:41.560\nUnderneath the third seashell is a peanut.\n\n01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:44.560\nThat happens.\n\n01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:47.560\nI leave the bathroom.\n\n01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:50.560\nAnd I notice something strange is going on.\n\n01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.560\nThere's something strange going on.\n\n01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:53.560\nThere's something strange going on.\n\n01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.560\nI'm drying my hands, man.\n\n01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.560\nThat's all I'm doing.\n\n01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:58.560\nJust drying my hands.\n\n01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.560\nSomething strange is going on.\n\n01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.560\nSomeone's drying their hands.\n\n01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:03.560\nThey're just drying their hands.\n\n01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.560\nThey're drying their hands.\n\n01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:06.560\nJust drying my hands.\n\n01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:07.560\nYou see a man.\n\n01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.560\nHe's a small, elven figure in a cloak.\n\n01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.560\nAnd he's drying his hands.\n\n01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:16.560\nI already know what I see.\n\n01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.560\nWho are you?\n\n01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:20.560\nI'm the bathroom attendant.\n\n01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:22.560\nWould you like a tic-tac?\n\n01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.560\nI'm the dungeon master.\n\n01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:27.560\nThe bathroom attendant starts turning into a troll.\n\n01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:28.560\nWhat do you do?\n\n01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.560\nWho are you?\n\n01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:30.560\nYou can't...\n\n01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:31.560\nI'm another dungeon master.\n\n01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.560\nWhat? You can't...\n\n01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:35.560\nThat doesn't happen.\n\n01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:36.560\nYes, it does.\n\n01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.560\nThat does happen.\n\n01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.560\nThe bathroom attendant turns into a troll\n\n01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:43.560\nand starts eating your neck.\n\n01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.560\nThat happens.\n\n01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:47.560\nYou need to tell me.\n\n01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:48.560\nI'm your neck.\n\n01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:49.560\nI'm your neck.\n\n01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:50.560\nI'm also a dungeon master.\n\n01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:51.560\nNo.\n\n01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:52.560\nThis one does happen.\n\n01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.560\nThis one does happen.\n\n01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:54.560\nAnd it passes through me.\n\n01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:55.560\nThat happens.\n\n01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:58.560\nI bring out my sword and I charge both of you\n\n01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.560\nwith my sword, which is two dungeon masters.\n\n01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.560\nThe sword has to roll a five or greater.\n\n01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.560\nThis is the part one of the sword.\n\n01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.560\nI'm a dungeon master.\n\n01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:10.560\nThat happens.\n\n01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:12.560\nThis is part two of the sword.\n\n01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:15.560\nI'm also a dungeon master.\n\n01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:18.560\nThat doesn't happen.\n\n01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.560\nMy sword is immobile.\n\n01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:23.560\nThat's what happens.\n\n01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:26.560\nThat happens.\n\n01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:28.560\nI said it didn't happen.\n\n01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:32.560\nYeah, I said it did.\n\n01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.560\nYou seem to be in a strange situation.\n\n01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.560\nThere's dungeon masters everywhere\n\n01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:38.560\nsaying that's happening,\n\n01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:39.560\nbut something's not happening.\n\n01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.560\nThe movie is about to start.\n\n01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:46.560\nThe lights are flickering up and down.\n\n01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:53.560\nAre you going to go make it in time?\n\n01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.560\nYes.\n\n01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:59.560\nYou sit down and you watch a trailer\n\n01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:03.560\nfor Norm of the North.\n\n01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:08.560\nAnd watch the Revenant.\n\n01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.560\nI pull a mirror out of my pocket\n\n01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:12.560\nand look into it.\n\n01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.560\nThat happens.\n\n01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.560\nIn the mirror you see a dungeon master.\n\n01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:20.560\nIt's me.\n\n01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:21.560\nHey.\n\n01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:23.560\nWhy isn't it me?\n\n01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:28.560\nHey, I didn't write this dungeon master.\n\n01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:35.560\nHow are you a master then?\n\n01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:40.560\nI checked the mirror for secret doors.\n\n01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:43.560\nChecking the mirror for secret doors.\n\n01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:44.560\nI find a secret door.\n\n01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:47.560\nThe secret door opens with a secret mirror.\n\n01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:49.560\nI go behind the secret door.\n\n01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:50.560\nYou do that.\n\n01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:53.560\nThere's a whole chamber of mirrors\n\n01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.560\nand everything's a mirror.\n\n01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:00.560\nHey, I'm stuck in here too.\n\n01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:03.560\nI'm a mirror.\n\n01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:05.560\nMy name's Amir.\n\n01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:08.560\nOne of the mirrors seems to be different from the mirrors.\n\n01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.560\nThe mirror is talking to you.\n\n01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:13.560\nHey, what's going on?\n\n01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:17.560\nMy name's Amir.\n\n01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.560\nYou know?\n\n01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.560\nWait.\n\n01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:24.560\nDo you know what I mean?\n\n01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:25.560\nAmir.\n\n01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:26.560\nMy name's Amir.\n\n01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:28.560\nYou mean a Middle Eastern mirror named Amir.\n\n01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:29.560\nRight.\n\n01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:32.560\nI'm just a person named Amir.\n\n01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.560\nGotcha.\n\n01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:35.560\nI wrote this dungeon.\n\n01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:40.560\nI just want to make sure that everybody knows that it's spelled like E-M-I-R.\n\n01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:41.560\nThank you.\n\n01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:42.560\nOkay, good.\n\n01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:45.560\nWhile this is happening, all the glass in all the room\n\n01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:48.560\nbreaks down into individual shards\n\n01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:52.560\nand all the shards coalesce into a large thing.\n\n01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:53.560\nThat's a huge person.\n\n01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:57.560\nHello, I am Gamma Potato.\n\n01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:58.560\nOh, shit.\n\n01:52:58.560 --> 01:52:59.560\nWhat are we going to do?\n\n01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:00.560\nI'm Amir.\n\n01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:03.560\nThe last shard monster looks over his shoulders\n\n01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.560\nat the Gamma Potato voice and says,\n\n01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:07.560\nI didn't say that.\n\n01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:09.560\nI'm Mirror Shard.\n\n01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:11.560\nI'm Amir.\n\n01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:13.560\nWe should get along.\n\n01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:18.560\nThat happens, but it's not supposed to.\n\n01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.560\nI'm Amir, man.\n\n01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:21.560\nI'm Amir.\n\n01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:25.560\nWhile this is happening, the Mirror Shard man points his hands\n\n01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.560\nin a magical manner at both of you.\n\n01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:29.560\nIt makes everything explode.\n\n01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:30.560\nEverything explodes.\n\n01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:32.560\nEverything you say makes you explode.\n\n01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:33.560\nEverything explodes.\n\n01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:35.560\nEverything explodes and you're completely alone\n\n01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:36.560\nin a black void.\n\n01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:42.560\nShard man, my name's Amir.\n\n01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:45.560\nYou know, my name's Amir.\n\n01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:48.560\nAnd there's a bunch of mirrors.\n\n01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:50.560\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:51.560\nOkay.\n\n01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:52.560\nKind of cool.\n\n01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.560\nI don't get your point.\n\n01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:55.560\nI don't get your point.\n\n01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:59.560\nAmir sounds like a mirror.\n\n01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:00.560\nOkay.\n\n01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.560\nIf you say it.\n\n01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:04.560\nHe takes his mirror fist and it grows to the size\n\n01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:07.560\nof eight million suns and it crushes around you\n\n01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:11.560\nand it squeezes you and it makes your whole soul die.\n\n01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:12.560\nI would think you...\n\n01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:15.560\nAll of your energy goes away and you can't exist anymore\n\n01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:17.560\nand you've never existed across all time.\n\n01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:19.560\nYou've never existed.\n\n01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:21.560\nAnd you can't speak ever.\n\n01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:28.560\nThe mirror man rises up and says,\n\n01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:30.560\nNo, you're mine.\n\n01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:32.560\nI finally have you now.\n\n01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:36.560\nI've got you now.\n\n01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:38.560\nCliff Hanger.\n\n01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:43.560\nThis is the regular room.\n\n01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:45.560\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:48.560\nTo be continued, everybody.\n\n01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:55.560\nLet's hear for Rob Schaab, shall we?\n\n01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:58.560\nZoe Lister Jones, Junior Jones.\n\n01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.560\nThank you for
