00:00.000 --> 00:09.500
["Humming Town"]

00:09.500 --> 00:12.640
From down down comics, in Hollywood, California,

00:12.640 --> 00:15.100
HUMMING TOWN is now...

00:15.100 --> 00:16.100
It's like a...

00:16.100 --> 00:19.640
Just a little lovely, a hot week

00:19.640 --> 00:23.640
And once you're on the outside

00:23.640 --> 00:24.640
You live in a...

00:24.640 --> 00:26.860
Let's bring out the mirror of HUMMING TOWN

00:26.860 --> 00:28.140
Mr. Dan Humphill!

00:28.140 --> 00:39.900
["HUMMING TOWN"]

00:39.900 --> 00:40.900
Hello.

00:40.900 --> 00:41.900
Thank you.

00:41.900 --> 00:44.400
You're Comptroller, Mr. Jefferson Davis.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.600
["HUMMING TOWN"]

00:47.600 --> 00:48.600
I never do that.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.600
I never...

00:49.600 --> 00:50.600
I never do that.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.600
You didn't know that I was the president of the Confederate States?

00:52.600 --> 00:54.400
Whole shows go by and I never actually go.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.900
Jeff Davis, by the way.

00:55.900 --> 00:56.900
People should do that.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.900
I think it's kind of implied, isn't it?

00:58.900 --> 00:59.900
Isn't it?

00:59.900 --> 01:00.900
A little implicit?

01:00.900 --> 01:01.900
I did.

01:01.900 --> 01:02.900
You're thinking very healthy.

01:02.900 --> 01:03.900
No, I think...

01:03.900 --> 01:06.900
I don't come to HUMMING TOWN because I want the notoriety,

01:06.900 --> 01:11.900
otherwise I would be standing on stage and hiding behind a giant Buick-sized...

01:11.900 --> 01:14.900
Hey, I don't come to HUMMING TOWN for the notoriety either.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.900
["HUMMING TOWN"]

01:17.900 --> 01:19.900
Why did you name it HUMMING TOWN?

01:19.900 --> 01:20.900
I couldn't...

01:20.900 --> 01:21.900
I'm bad at names.

01:21.900 --> 01:22.900
Like, I...

01:22.900 --> 01:24.900
Everything I came up with was taken.

01:24.900 --> 01:28.900
I wanted to call it Scott Ackerman's...

01:28.900 --> 01:29.900
Palooza.

01:29.900 --> 01:36.900
I tried calling it at one point...

01:36.900 --> 01:37.900
What's it?

01:37.900 --> 01:40.900
Kevin Pollock TOWN?

01:40.900 --> 01:42.900
But then I was like...

01:42.900 --> 01:46.900
You guys are best friends, aren't you?

01:46.900 --> 01:48.900
I don't like him anymore.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.900
I don't like Kevin Pollock.

01:50.900 --> 01:51.900
Let the feud begin.

01:51.900 --> 01:52.900
All right.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.900
So I got nothing.

01:54.900 --> 01:56.900
I didn't write anything in my phone.

01:56.900 --> 02:05.900
Then Dan, I will take it as Comptroller upon myself to tell you that today was a big day in sports.

02:05.900 --> 02:06.900
Oh, oh, oh!

02:06.900 --> 02:08.900
So we're going to do an old-fashioned...

02:08.900 --> 02:10.900
Was it today the Super Bowl?

02:10.900 --> 02:11.900
Yes, it was.

02:11.900 --> 02:15.900
And I was surrounded by guys on the set because I was shooting today,

02:15.900 --> 02:20.900
and as we all know, everyone in the crew is into football,

02:20.900 --> 02:22.900
and then the actors aren't,

02:22.900 --> 02:24.900
but then the crew was walking around going like,

02:24.900 --> 02:25.900
Don't tell me!

02:25.900 --> 02:26.900
Don't shut up!

02:26.900 --> 02:27.900
Don't tell me!

02:27.900 --> 02:29.900
Because they're all DVR-ing the game.

02:29.900 --> 02:30.900
Did they tell you anything?

02:30.900 --> 02:31.900
How much?

02:31.900 --> 02:32.900
No.

02:32.900 --> 02:33.900
I don't know.

02:33.900 --> 02:39.900
Well, that is time for a sports career!

02:39.900 --> 02:41.900
Throw balls, throw balls around.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.900
When you throw balls, you're going to get around.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.900
Oh, it's good to throw balls.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.900
It's good to invest in your body.

02:48.900 --> 02:54.900
It's a good thing to do because everybody knows that's what makes you happy.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.900
Because look at life and look at history.

02:57.900 --> 03:03.900
Everyone that's physically superior always ends up being unexploited and happy.

03:03.900 --> 03:06.900
And rich and in control of other people.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.900
I'll say, I cut that off.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.900
Oh, wait, it's the other way around.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.900
Should we start again?

03:13.900 --> 03:23.900
Actually, the more sit-ups you do, the closer you get to being a slave.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.900
A fate I wouldn't wish on anyone.

03:33.900 --> 03:36.900
But hey, if it's going to happen to someone, it might as well be an idiot.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.900
Our timing is up.

03:38.900 --> 03:43.900
Hey.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.900
Get to the bottom of this.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.900
Hey, there's Dan Harmon.

03:48.900 --> 03:51.900
He's dirty and he's in the corner, minding his own business.

03:51.900 --> 03:55.900
Let's pick on him because obviously football isn't that fulfilling

03:55.900 --> 03:58.900
because we have free time to pick on people.

03:58.900 --> 03:59.900
Let's go pick on him.

03:59.900 --> 04:01.900
What do you have to say, Dan?

04:01.900 --> 04:02.900
Why don't you throw a football?

04:02.900 --> 04:04.900
I don't think it's very important.

04:04.900 --> 04:09.900
I'm not... I don't think it's important.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.900
Well, we think you're wrong.

04:11.900 --> 04:15.900
Well, I'm willing to bet my fucking life on it.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.900
And yours.

04:17.900 --> 04:19.900
Without moving a muscle.

04:19.900 --> 04:23.900
Well, we're not willing to risk anything, but we're going to punch you.

04:23.900 --> 04:27.900
I'll see you in seven years, you piece of shit.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.900
Seven years later.

04:29.900 --> 04:34.900
Okay, I'm still a nerd and I don't have any money.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.900
Ten years after that.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.900
Ah-ha, I got you.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.900
I'm a PA in basic table.

04:40.900 --> 04:43.900
All right, I think...

04:43.900 --> 04:45.900
Okay, great.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.900
I don't have my iPad, Dan.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.900
I'm going off the phone now and it's a little harder to operate.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.900
You're going to have to deal with a little sloppy or controlling music wise.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.900
Listen, I got drunk today too.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.900
I was drinking all day today.

05:03.900 --> 05:04.900
But you were working.

05:04.900 --> 05:05.900
I know.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.900
You drinking on the set?

05:07.900 --> 05:09.900
Yeah.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.900
It's called functional alcoholism.

05:12.900 --> 05:15.900
That's my gig, baby.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.900
But I am a little softer on the edges, a little sloppy.

05:18.900 --> 05:23.900
Dan, don't deflect from the fact that we are now in sports corner proper.

05:23.900 --> 05:24.900
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

05:24.900 --> 05:25.900
Yes, yes.

05:25.900 --> 05:26.900
Well, you know what? Do the thing.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.900
Okay, we're good.

05:29.900 --> 05:31.900
What's in the middle?

05:31.900 --> 05:33.900
Start from the beginning.

05:33.900 --> 05:34.900
Yeah, but this is off the phone.

05:34.900 --> 05:35.900
Okay, here we go.

05:35.900 --> 05:36.900
From the top.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.900
Sports corner!

05:38.900 --> 05:40.900
Oh!

05:40.900 --> 05:42.900
Hey, what is going on?

05:42.900 --> 05:47.900
Vonnegut, Picasso, Tom Hanks, who knows who they are?

05:47.900 --> 05:52.900
Uh, hey, but what about that Brett Favre?

05:52.900 --> 06:01.900
So Dan, off the top here, let's just come straight out.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.900
Did you think the best team won today?

06:04.900 --> 06:06.900
First off.

06:06.900 --> 06:11.900
Obviously, Jeff, the beautiful thing about football, and the reason why everyone loves it so much,

06:11.900 --> 06:14.900
is that the best team always wins.

06:14.900 --> 06:18.900
That's the point of football, is it's a metric of worth.

06:18.900 --> 06:24.900
We spend our days wandering around the city streets, not knowing if we succeeded or failed.

06:24.900 --> 06:30.900
And then we, only in these arenas can we see, oh, I got a first down.

06:30.900 --> 06:36.900
I'm a better person than the guy that only got a second down.

06:36.900 --> 06:40.900
And if I get enough first downs, I can get a touchdown.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.900
And then I get a rose bowl.

06:43.900 --> 06:48.900
And if I get three rose bowls, I put them in a super bowl.

06:48.900 --> 06:52.900
And then I really eat all the rose bowls.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.900
Because I'm so powerful.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.900
I'm such a powerful person.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.900
Are you a coach or a player in this?

07:00.900 --> 07:04.900
I'm just a general fan of everything athletic.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.900
I think it's a great way to spend your time.

07:07.900 --> 07:14.900
And when I was in kindergarten, they tried to hold me back for a grade, because I didn't know how to walk on a balance beam.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.900
What?

07:16.900 --> 07:24.900
And you know what, I applaud their scrutiny, because I'm famous for my balance.

07:24.900 --> 07:25.900
I've always found you.

07:25.900 --> 07:31.900
Not only am I, but so many are.

07:31.900 --> 07:36.900
Beethoven, Einstein, Steve Jobs.

07:36.900 --> 07:41.900
Boy, they're like cats.

07:41.900 --> 07:45.900
I mean, we're in turmoil as a culture.

07:45.900 --> 07:49.900
Where do we fucking cut this shit off and make a moon raker colony?

07:49.900 --> 07:54.900
Balance.

07:54.900 --> 07:59.900
So the Broncos were favored by six points.

07:59.900 --> 08:02.900
But who did you think was going to win?

08:02.900 --> 08:04.900
The Patriots?

08:04.900 --> 08:07.900
The Patriots were already out of it because they had already lost.

08:07.900 --> 08:11.900
Yeah, the guy lost his shoulder.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.900
And then of course there were those rape charges.

08:15.900 --> 08:18.900
That's a pretty good guess.

08:18.900 --> 08:21.900
On my part.

08:21.900 --> 08:26.900
You're talking about the New England Cosby's.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.900
Okay, so it was the Patriots versus the Broncos.

08:28.900 --> 08:30.900
No, no, versus the Panthers.

08:30.900 --> 08:31.900
Panthers versus Broncos.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.900
New England Panthers.

08:33.900 --> 08:34.900
Carolina Panthers.

08:34.900 --> 08:35.900
Carolina Panthers.

08:35.900 --> 08:36.900
Which Carolina?

08:36.900 --> 08:37.900
I think North.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.900
North Carolina Panthers.

08:39.900 --> 08:40.900
All right.

08:40.900 --> 08:46.900
Okay, the North Carolina Panthers in full representation of the North Carolina lifestyle.

08:46.900 --> 08:55.900
Absolutely separating themselves from that bullshit Southern Carolina by virtue of the Panther.

08:55.900 --> 08:59.900
Their state cat.

08:59.900 --> 09:01.900
I think they did a great job today.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.900
Okay, let's be honest.

09:04.900 --> 09:07.900
You don't care for sports so much, but I know that you do love entertainment.

09:07.900 --> 09:12.900
You are known to be quite an arbiter of what is and what is not entertainment.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.900
I thought the Black Eyed Peas and Sean Penn did a great job.

09:15.900 --> 09:20.900
You're closer than you know.

09:20.900 --> 09:29.900
I was amazed when Gallagher came out with his head had been surgically reattached to Anthony Bourdain.

09:29.900 --> 09:33.900
They opened up with, they came out, it started with Coldplay.

09:33.900 --> 09:37.900
You know, the most exciting band of all time.

09:37.900 --> 09:48.900
Is this a tribute to concussions and people who have suffered so much head trauma that Coldplay is more at their speed now.

09:48.900 --> 09:53.900
Then, I believe it was Bruno Mars and company came out and they're like, they fucking whip ass.

09:53.900 --> 09:59.900
There was a bunch of dudes in the same suit and they're doing like Michael Jackson, James Brown moves.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.900
And then Beyonce comes out, but still there's a Coldplay out on stage.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.900
There's a Coldplay out on stage?

10:05.900 --> 10:08.900
Beyonce was like tripping over him.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.900
Oh, the single ladies.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.900
What the fuck, there's a Coldplay.

10:12.900 --> 10:21.900
I was leaving, I left the game during halftime so I didn't see it, but I heard that there was a thing where Beyonce almost fell over on stage.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.900
And people were already online talking about Beyonce almost wiped out on stage.

10:24.900 --> 10:25.900
So I looked at it.

10:25.900 --> 10:27.900
Yes, Beyonce almost wiped out.

10:27.900 --> 10:36.900
She's wearing what I can only describe as a leather one piece swimsuit with Michael Jackson braids and epaulets on it.

10:36.900 --> 10:40.900
And like, it was pretty, pretty good and pretty sexy.

10:40.900 --> 10:45.900
And then she kind of did a little stumble backwards and in high ass platform heels.

10:45.900 --> 10:52.900
She caught herself, jumped back and jumped up and hit the beat with every other dancer behind her.

10:52.900 --> 10:53.900
She couldn't even see.

10:53.900 --> 10:58.900
So if anybody's trying to talk shit about her almost wiped out, and I was like, no, not only did she almost wipe out,

10:58.900 --> 11:01.900
she proved that she's in better shape than anybody else.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.900
Yeah, that was amazing.

11:03.900 --> 11:04.900
I think she'll be fine.

11:04.900 --> 11:05.900
I think she will.

11:05.900 --> 11:06.900
PR wise.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.900
I have a feeling that's not going to dig her.

11:08.900 --> 11:16.900
If she fell on her ass and chipped over the side and like kicked the person in the face by accident, that would be, you know, clickbait for a long time.

11:16.900 --> 11:23.900
I think with Bey, as I call her, she'd have to do more than that to start to suffer a cue rating.

11:23.900 --> 11:24.900
Right.

11:24.900 --> 11:33.900
She'd have to, as she kicked up, her shoe would have to hit the new Twin Towers.

11:33.900 --> 11:41.900
Okay, I was going to say like a prematurely born baby.

11:41.900 --> 11:46.900
And that land on the baby.

11:46.900 --> 11:53.900
And I remember like, oh, and then she'd have to stand up and say, no, no, let him take it like a man.

11:53.900 --> 12:01.900
And the parents would be like, no, but Beyonce, we want to just lift the shoe relative to this baby, developing baby.

12:01.900 --> 12:06.900
And she's like, if he was born, he can live.

12:06.900 --> 12:10.900
And if he dies, he didn't deserve to be born.

12:10.900 --> 12:16.900
And then that, I think people would be like hashtag, like maybe Beyonce, maybe not.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.900
There might be a backlash.

12:18.900 --> 12:26.900
Or like if she went like all the single ladies and then she went like this and it said like Christ lives.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.900
It's like on her breast.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.900
She'd gain some fans but lose more.

12:31.900 --> 12:38.900
I'd feel like anybody that brings a preemie to a Super Bowl half time celebration.

12:38.900 --> 12:47.900
If Beyonce brought up, if she brought up, she was like all the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies.

12:47.900 --> 12:51.900
When you're a single lady, you want a man and you don't want to vaccinate your kid.

12:51.900 --> 12:59.900
And then she brings out a kid, like a four-year-old kid and there's a giant hypodermic needle.

12:59.900 --> 13:03.900
And then there's a certificate of vaccination with no signature on it.

13:03.900 --> 13:07.900
And then it was like in her side, she goes, all the single ladies, what's your name, ma'am?

13:07.900 --> 13:10.900
Margaret Dawson from Montana.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.900
All the single ladies, what's your name, sir?

13:12.900 --> 13:13.900
Bob Dawson.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.900
All the single ladies, all the single ladies.

13:15.900 --> 13:16.900
And you're here to vaccinate your kid?

13:16.900 --> 13:17.900
Yeah.

13:17.900 --> 13:20.900
All the single ladies, well, I'm here to talk you out of it.

13:20.900 --> 13:25.900
Make it to the bop, put it to the stop, put it on the flap, top, top.

13:25.900 --> 13:29.900
And then like, but we really want to vaccinate our kid.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.900
And she's like, I don't care, I'm not letting you.

13:31.900 --> 13:36.900
And then she like kicks the giant needle and it breaks.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.900
And all the vaccination goes into the football field.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.900
And she's like, that's where it belongs, in the dirt.

13:42.900 --> 13:45.900
Don't vaccinate your kids.

13:45.900 --> 13:51.900
And then Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy drop down on parachutes.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.900
Wait, what's their mission?

13:54.900 --> 13:56.900
Support.

13:56.900 --> 14:01.900
I thought they were like threshold guardians where they're going to say no.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.900
Oh God, no, no, no, they're all into it.

14:03.900 --> 14:07.900
In this world where Beyonce suffers a little bit from the halftime show.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.900
If none of that happened, I think she'll be fine.

14:09.900 --> 14:11.900
I think she will be fine.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.900
Janet Jackson, however.

14:14.900 --> 14:16.900
One titty from infamy.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.900
Showed her nipple.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.900
She rolled the dice.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.900
She paid the piper.

14:22.900 --> 14:26.900
Not the price that we could have.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.900
The piper knows what the price is.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.900
Does the piper not like to rhyme?

14:31.900 --> 14:33.900
I don't pay the piper.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.900
I'm sorry, I don't.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.900
Put a pen on it.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.900
I never pay the price.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.900
I pay the piper.

14:41.900 --> 14:44.900
The piper knows what the price is.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.900
I let the piper handle my money.

14:47.900 --> 14:51.900
You're not at that stage yet.

14:51.900 --> 14:56.900
It's the worst show ever if you're just tuning in.

14:56.900 --> 14:59.900
I think this is still a thing you tune into, right?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.900
People are probably flipping podcasts right now.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.900
Can you flip? I guess you can flip.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.900
I think you're flipping between Kevin Pollack and this.

15:07.900 --> 15:11.900
What people don't know is that we have a cavalcade of stars.

15:11.900 --> 15:16.900
You and I could start off as clumsily as we possibly could.

15:16.900 --> 15:20.900
This show will succeed based on the energy of the rocket fuel

15:20.900 --> 15:23.900
that we have in the booster, which I call the green room.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.900
Let's start out.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.900
Let's make a new friend in Hollywood.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.900
Let's talk to our new friend.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.900
She's here.

15:31.900 --> 15:35.900
You may recognize her from the recent hit.

15:35.900 --> 15:38.900
God damn it. I don't watch TV anymore.

15:38.900 --> 15:41.900
Life in pieces. Go fuck yourself, America.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.900
No, she's wonderful.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.900
We're going to talk to her about life and acting.

15:46.900 --> 15:51.900
Please welcome Zoe Lister Jr. Jones.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.900
Lister Jr.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.900
Junior?

15:55.900 --> 15:57.900
Zoe Lister Jr.

15:57.900 --> 15:59.900
That's it.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.900
That one.

16:01.900 --> 16:06.900
We need to take 10 minutes to talk about what I just did.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.900
Hello, Zoe Lister Jr.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.900
I like that a lot better than my name.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.900
Is it tiny Lister Jr.?

16:12.900 --> 16:16.900
That's the guy that's like the Zeus guy that like he does the pecs.

16:16.900 --> 16:19.900
Like it's an 80s thing.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.900
Zoe Lister Jr.

16:21.900 --> 16:27.900
How's your dad? The infamous Zoe Lister.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.900
Zoe Lister Jones.

16:29.900 --> 16:31.900
Don't confuse me.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.900
I'm tiny Lister Jones.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.900
Here's the next thing I'm going to get wrong.

16:35.900 --> 16:39.900
The most recent project that you've done is this movie and it's called Consumed.

16:39.900 --> 16:41.900
Very good.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.900
Nailed it.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.900
Called it Consumption 8 times.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.900
I'm busy. I'm a workaholic.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.900
I don't know nothing about nothing.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.900
Which is the combination of being an alcoholic who works.

16:52.900 --> 16:56.900
The workaholic covers the scent of the alcohol.

16:56.900 --> 17:00.900
People are like, well, he's getting shit done. He can't be that drunk.

17:00.900 --> 17:05.900
Consumed, it's a horror movie?

17:05.900 --> 17:07.900
It's a dramatic thriller.

17:07.900 --> 17:09.900
But it has some horrifying elements.

17:09.900 --> 17:13.900
It takes place in the world of genetically modified organisms.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.900
Is this something that you wrote or you're acting in?

17:15.900 --> 17:20.900
I co-wrote it with my husband and co-produced it and yet act in it.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.900
You're a workaholic. Do you also drink or are you just a worker?

17:23.900 --> 17:24.900
I don't drink.

17:24.900 --> 17:25.900
But you just work a lot?

17:25.900 --> 17:26.900
That's good.

17:26.900 --> 17:27.900
I vape.

17:27.900 --> 17:28.900
Do you not drink?

17:28.900 --> 17:29.900
You're a vape-aholic.

17:29.900 --> 17:32.900
Because you used to or because people that raised you did?

17:32.900 --> 17:35.900
No. Well, I did used to.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.900
People who raised me also did.

17:37.900 --> 17:41.900
But I just prefer that vape life. I don't know.

17:41.900 --> 17:45.900
It's better for your skin. It makes it less puffy.

17:45.900 --> 17:46.900
Yeah, less puffy.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.900
I'm turning into Shatner.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.900
There's no hangovers.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.900
Once you notice it, it's too late.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.900
Like, oh, I drank for 40 years.

17:55.900 --> 17:59.900
It's not like you could be like, oh, I'm going to now start eating wheat thins.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.900
There's no reverse.

18:01.900 --> 18:06.900
I like that in this day and age wheat thins are like the healthiest thing you can think of.

18:06.900 --> 18:09.900
Wheat thins for me are like dessert.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.900
All right.

18:11.900 --> 18:15.900
It's not a competition.

18:15.900 --> 18:21.900
Zoe, when you're living that vape life,

18:21.900 --> 18:23.900
do you not get the munchies and want a snack?

18:23.900 --> 18:25.900
I do. I do.

18:25.900 --> 18:28.900
But, you know, I keep all wheat thins out of my house.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.900
The wheat thins are...

18:31.900 --> 18:34.900
I don't think wheat thins are even in production anymore.

18:34.900 --> 18:37.900
They absolutely are.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.900
And I know that they're not healthy,

18:39.900 --> 18:42.900
but there is a holdover from the 80s culture where there was such a thing.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.900
I know. Those were the healthiest things.

18:44.900 --> 18:47.900
Yeah, it was like the font suggested health.

18:47.900 --> 18:48.900
I know.

18:48.900 --> 18:52.900
It's like beautiful radiant. There's like wheat.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.900
Like there's a stalk of wheat.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.900
And then the other word is thin.

18:57.900 --> 18:58.900
Thin. Yeah.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.900
You could do that in the 80s and people would just be like,

19:00.900 --> 19:02.900
look, this is a good faith agreement.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.900
Like, why would a box lie to me?

19:05.900 --> 19:06.900
Yeah.

19:06.900 --> 19:11.900
Did wheat thins have like the pictures on the back with all the different like toppings you could?

19:11.900 --> 19:13.900
Oh, that was triscus.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.900
Oh, those were really nasty.

19:15.900 --> 19:17.900
Yeah, no, wheat thins were delicious.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.900
Triscus are better than wheat thins. They're both good.

19:19.900 --> 19:20.900
I like them both.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.900
A triscus.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.900
Well, we found out what our show is about.

19:24.900 --> 19:28.900
Triscus are fucking garbage.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.900
Oh, we chapped into something.

19:36.900 --> 19:37.900
Yeah.

19:37.900 --> 19:38.900
Yeah, well, I...

19:38.900 --> 19:40.900
This should be Vinny's new platform.

19:43.900 --> 19:44.900
He's got the youth.

19:44.900 --> 19:48.900
So you're being a sensible vape snacker. What do you munch on?

19:48.900 --> 19:53.900
Oh, a variety of like gluten-free snack items.

19:53.900 --> 19:54.900
No wheat.

19:54.900 --> 19:59.900
Did you find out, did you gauge and go, oh shit, I'm a celiac?

19:59.900 --> 20:00.900
Is that what it's called?

20:00.900 --> 20:03.900
No, I'm not celiac. I'm like, I have a sensitivity.

20:03.900 --> 20:06.900
And you know, like when you go to a restaurant, you say like, I don't eat gluten.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.900
They're always like, is it an allergy?

20:08.900 --> 20:10.900
They're calling you out.

20:10.900 --> 20:14.900
That's like when you go to the restaurant and go table for five, and there's only two of you,

20:14.900 --> 20:16.900
and you're like, are they all here?

20:16.900 --> 20:19.900
Yeah, I'm three of them.

20:19.900 --> 20:22.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.

20:22.900 --> 20:24.900
I don't have celiac. That's like legit.

20:24.900 --> 20:28.900
I'm an actress. I make shit up and then like make my life harder.

20:28.900 --> 20:33.900
But the gluten thing, we don't have to talk about this all night,

20:33.900 --> 20:36.900
but you're a good person to talk to about it.

20:36.900 --> 20:41.900
God damn it, Harmon. Get your shit together.

20:41.900 --> 20:48.900
The reason why it's like in the zeitgeist is because we,

20:48.900 --> 20:53.900
you don't have to be allergic to it in order to possibly benefit from cutting it out.

20:53.900 --> 20:54.900
Correct. Yeah.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.900
There are a lot of people with gluten sensitivities.

20:56.900 --> 20:59.900
There's a lot of pesticides on wheat and people have.

20:59.900 --> 21:01.900
But even if you don't have a sensitivity, I guess that's my question.

21:01.900 --> 21:06.900
Like it's not about, oh, we're all finding out some of us or have reactions to it.

21:06.900 --> 21:10.900
Is it more like carbs where we're like, oh, we, we cracked the code?

21:10.900 --> 21:15.900
Oh yeah. I mean, there's like the whole like paleo craze where you like cut out starches too.

21:15.900 --> 21:19.900
But like that's been going on. Yeah. I mean, if you want to, if you want to be thin,

21:19.900 --> 21:23.900
you don't eat wheat, which is why wheat things are just a terrible snack.

21:23.900 --> 21:27.900
That's, I mean, now that we look back on it, it's like, of course that's what they were,

21:27.900 --> 21:32.900
they knew that in the boardroom. They're like, we shouldn't call it wheat fats.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.900
It's going to make them fat.

21:34.900 --> 21:37.900
That's why I like a Trisket because it just tried to fucking lie to you.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.900
Fuck Trisket.

21:39.900 --> 21:44.900
A Trisket named itself as a mythical character, a Trisket.

21:44.900 --> 21:48.900
When they were coming up with the name Marlboro, they weren't like,

21:48.900 --> 21:50.900
what sounds the most like cancer?

21:50.900 --> 21:51.900
Yeah.

21:51.900 --> 21:54.900
What we want to drive home is what's going to happen.

21:54.900 --> 21:57.900
They want to, they want to whisk you away. Yeah.

21:57.900 --> 21:58.900
Cool.

21:58.900 --> 22:02.900
But Trisket is a biscuit that's Trisk. Like, what is it?

22:02.900 --> 22:04.900
Well, how do they get that name?

22:04.900 --> 22:10.900
I bet it's tri, I bet that, my guess, my guess, three forms of fucking something.

22:10.900 --> 22:13.900
Like, do you get three farms of protein? Yeah.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.900
You got your breads and your cereals and your grains.

22:15.900 --> 22:18.900
I'll bet you a million dollars. No, I won't bet you a million dollars.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.900
No, no, no, bet me a million dollars.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.900
No, no, I did not bet you a million dollars.

22:22.900 --> 22:26.900
You're kind of tying into the, a Tisket, a Tasket, right?

22:26.900 --> 22:29.900
Oh, shit, no, that's it.

22:29.900 --> 22:31.900
But why are then, why the Trisket?

22:31.900 --> 22:34.900
Okay, I'm going back to my, on the back of the Trisket box,

22:34.900 --> 22:40.900
I bet there's like a weird fucking triangle where there's like a basket of bread

22:40.900 --> 22:46.900
and then like a bundle of wheat and then like a chicken with a bicycle or something.

22:46.900 --> 22:50.900
And it's like, and it's like, you get all three and it's like, it's good for you.

22:50.900 --> 22:54.900
And then there's probably like a woman in a leotard like doing a, doing the splits.

22:54.900 --> 22:59.900
This is my guess. Actually, that's not being my guess and turned into me.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.900
Just creating pornography for myself.

23:02.900 --> 23:06.900
And then there's like a guy in a Superman costume just watching from the corner.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.900
He's watching the chicken on the bicycle though.

23:08.900 --> 23:10.900
Yeah, yeah, no, there's a dotted line.

23:10.900 --> 23:13.900
And if you, it stops, it stops halfway.

23:13.900 --> 23:18.900
And if you like, they discerning consumers of Trisket, they're like, no, he's into the chicken.

23:18.900 --> 23:22.900
No, that's his game. Yeah.

23:22.900 --> 23:26.900
Um, okay. Well, I was, so you mentioned vaping.

23:26.900 --> 23:30.900
Is it like, like, like we, we, we respect any privacy you want.

23:30.900 --> 23:34.900
You're a new friend. Do you, do you want to, can we talk about pot for a little bit?

23:34.900 --> 23:36.900
Oh, we can talk about pot.

23:36.900 --> 23:40.900
So Sativa Indica, I'm just trying to figure this out.

23:40.900 --> 23:42.900
Well, you are, you're just trying to figure it out.

23:42.900 --> 23:46.900
I've been a 43 years old smoking pot since I was 18.

23:46.900 --> 23:50.900
But I, I think this, I don't know which is the one that makes me check my pulse and, and right.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.900
Don't get high anymore.

23:52.900 --> 23:58.900
Yeah. So Tiva's the upper and it indicates like to be a little sleepier.

23:58.900 --> 24:02.900
I'm in the process of an experiment and I could, so I did the first half of it.

24:02.900 --> 24:08.900
I went, I went to a party and I, and I, so I've talked to my girlfriend about this because she vapes like you.

24:08.900 --> 24:12.900
She's part of this whipper snapper, vape in generation.

24:12.900 --> 24:16.900
And I, oh, where is it?

24:16.900 --> 24:20.900
Oh shit. I'll never pot research. Okay. Here we go.

24:20.900 --> 24:31.900
So I started. So this is the first half because this is the, I, it's a 838 PM Sativa big hit blue dream.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.900
I think that's the kind of pot.

24:33.900 --> 24:34.900
Yeah.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.900
At animals screening.

24:36.900 --> 24:41.900
That's a restaurant here. And yeah, people love it.

24:41.900 --> 24:44.900
Very uncomfortable.

24:44.900 --> 24:45.900
Anxious.

24:45.900 --> 24:48.900
Constantly conscious of chest.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.900
Two deep breaths helped.

24:50.900 --> 24:57.900
Had to stop breathing after noting a slash hallucinating the notion that people are watching me breathing.

24:57.900 --> 25:00.900
That's all 838.

25:00.900 --> 25:01.900
Wow.

25:01.900 --> 25:05.900
And then 842 it says still same a little better.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.900
Doesn't make, even make sense.

25:07.900 --> 25:08.900
How can it still be the same?

25:08.900 --> 25:09.900
And a little bit better.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.900
Just say a little better, but he's high.

25:11.900 --> 25:12.900
Yeah.

25:12.900 --> 25:15.900
852, 10 minutes after that, this is the last injury.

25:15.900 --> 25:17.900
Just high.

25:17.900 --> 25:19.900
Really fucking high.

25:19.900 --> 25:22.900
As high as you can get without a net negative experience.

25:22.900 --> 25:23.900
Without a negative experience.

25:23.900 --> 25:25.900
And then a capital M.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.900
Also.

25:27.900 --> 25:28.900
Yeah.

25:28.900 --> 25:29.900
I think I started having fun at that point.

25:29.900 --> 25:31.900
Right. You're like, fuck this.

25:31.900 --> 25:44.900
So it looks like, and that was my estimation is like, I think getting high on pot is worth what happens to me often, which is this 838 to 852.

25:44.900 --> 25:46.900
I'm bad at math.

25:46.900 --> 25:47.900
Yeah.

25:47.900 --> 25:48.900
Are you good at it?

25:48.900 --> 25:49.900
No, no, of course not.

25:49.900 --> 25:50.900
Okay. All right.

25:50.900 --> 25:51.900
Say what?

25:51.900 --> 25:52.900
14 minutes.

25:52.900 --> 25:53.900
Oh, really?

25:53.900 --> 25:54.900
Yeah.

25:54.900 --> 25:56.900
Yeah, that's even better than I thought.

25:56.900 --> 26:02.900
It's 14 minutes of like, I'm checking my pulse and like, I'm worried that everyone knows I'm high.

26:02.900 --> 26:03.900
Yep.

26:03.900 --> 26:07.900
And then I'm too old to be getting high.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.900
But then you like, you like mellowed into it and you had a great time.

26:10.900 --> 26:11.900
Yeah, absolutely.

26:11.900 --> 26:12.900
Yeah.

26:12.900 --> 26:13.900
Pot's the best.

26:13.900 --> 26:17.900
Like, it's just so much better than alcohol because alcohol, which you're seeing me on.

26:17.900 --> 26:18.900
Right.

26:18.900 --> 26:19.900
It's like.

26:19.900 --> 26:20.900
Right.

26:20.900 --> 26:21.900
Like, just like killing yourself.

26:21.900 --> 26:22.900
Like you're just slowly falling asleep.

26:22.900 --> 26:23.900
Yeah.

26:23.900 --> 26:24.900
In front of and making it everyone else's problem.

26:24.900 --> 26:26.900
Zoe, did you say which one you prefer?

26:26.900 --> 26:28.900
The Sativa or Indica?

26:28.900 --> 26:29.900
I prefer Sativa.

26:29.900 --> 26:30.900
Yeah.

26:30.900 --> 26:31.900
I don't need help.

26:31.900 --> 26:34.900
And so you're saying the idea because I'm glad you didn't say head high and body high,

26:34.900 --> 26:36.900
which has never meant anything.

26:36.900 --> 26:41.900
Because if your head was high, your body would freak out and vice versa.

26:41.900 --> 26:42.900
For sure.

26:42.900 --> 26:43.900
Yeah.

26:43.900 --> 26:44.900
Hold on.

26:44.900 --> 26:45.900
I'm processing that.

26:45.900 --> 26:48.900
If your body's high, my head's going to be like, whoa.

26:48.900 --> 26:49.900
Yeah.

26:49.900 --> 26:50.900
Yeah.

26:50.900 --> 26:51.900
Yeah.

26:51.900 --> 26:52.900
Yeah.

26:52.900 --> 26:53.900
Totally.

26:53.900 --> 26:54.900
High?

26:54.900 --> 26:55.900
No.

26:55.900 --> 26:56.900
Doesn't body high include head?

26:56.900 --> 26:57.900
Isn't that like.

26:57.900 --> 27:01.900
I think the people using the phrases head high and body high are so used to being high that

27:01.900 --> 27:04.900
they don't know what it's like to be bad high.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.900
Anybody who can get bad high is like, and whose life depends.

27:07.900 --> 27:08.900
Yeah.

27:08.900 --> 27:09.900
They're like, head high, body high.

27:09.900 --> 27:10.900
Jesus Christ.

27:10.900 --> 27:11.900
Dude, what are you talking about?

27:11.900 --> 27:13.900
You're scaring me even more.

27:13.900 --> 27:14.900
Foot high, arm high.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.900
It's the worst show to not have Spencer here tonight.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.900
He would settle this for us.

27:18.900 --> 27:19.900
We have no Spencer tonight.

27:19.900 --> 27:20.900
No, it's punishment.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.900
He should not take off.

27:22.900 --> 27:28.900
I like that you're like, though, I think like a real time documentation is cool.

27:28.900 --> 27:29.900
Yeah.

27:29.900 --> 27:30.900
Yeah.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.900
My girlfriend said, well, just do both and like, let's figure it out.

27:32.900 --> 27:33.900
Yeah.

27:33.900 --> 27:34.900
Okay.

27:34.900 --> 27:35.900
But we have to spread it out over days.

27:35.900 --> 27:36.900
So that's Sativa.

27:36.900 --> 27:37.900
That's Sativa.

27:37.900 --> 27:38.900
So you haven't done the Indica.

27:38.900 --> 27:39.900
Right.

27:39.900 --> 27:40.900
I haven't done the experiment yet.

27:40.900 --> 27:43.900
And then of course there's a million flavors and stuff.

27:43.900 --> 27:44.900
Yeah.

27:44.900 --> 27:45.900
Yeah.

27:45.900 --> 27:46.900
Yeah.

27:46.900 --> 27:47.900
For me, I'm such a lightweight with marijuana.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.900
I can only do Sativa and operate.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.900
Like if I do Indica, like heavy stuff.

27:51.900 --> 27:57.900
I hang out with people like Greg Proops, as he says, he gets his weed from Yoda.

27:57.900 --> 27:59.900
His weed is wild.

27:59.900 --> 28:03.900
If I give his joint a stern glance, I'm fucked up.

28:03.900 --> 28:04.900
So I'll do it.

28:04.900 --> 28:09.900
Like if we're on the bus, like a tour bus for like eight hours where I don't have to do

28:09.900 --> 28:13.900
anything at all, but he can get up and talk and he's articulate and stuff like that.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.900
I'm completely wiped out by Indica.

28:15.900 --> 28:21.900
So Sativa, I can kind of get by, but I still just want to sit down and eat Triscuits.

28:21.900 --> 28:22.900
Boom!

28:22.900 --> 28:27.900
The Aristocrat, the Packers.

28:27.900 --> 28:34.900
Tired of not being able to eat a box?

28:34.900 --> 28:38.900
Sink your teeth into the cold, hard, croisin' flavor of Triscuits.

28:38.900 --> 28:42.900
Oh, Sam Elliott, do a Triscuits commercial.

28:42.900 --> 28:45.900
Hello, I'm Sam Elliott for Triscuits.

28:45.900 --> 28:47.900
It's a new feature, isn't it?

28:47.900 --> 28:49.900
Yeah, I've been to it.

28:49.900 --> 28:53.900
The wheat thin is for pussies.

28:53.900 --> 28:59.900
But the Triscuits holds up to the cold, hard salami that you're used to.

28:59.900 --> 29:00.900
I don't fuck with it.

29:00.900 --> 29:01.900
No, it's better.

29:01.900 --> 29:03.900
I'm sorry, I put you on the spot.

29:03.900 --> 29:04.900
Well, that's the job.

29:04.900 --> 29:08.900
It should be like Sam Elliott for pussies.

29:08.900 --> 29:12.900
Well, I'm Sam Elliott for pussies.

29:12.900 --> 29:17.900
Sometimes when I come home from a long day on the range, I like to take a nice pussie

29:17.900 --> 29:21.900
and put it on a trisket.

29:21.900 --> 29:24.900
All right, he's snuck it in. Synergy.

29:24.900 --> 29:26.900
He puts the pussie on the trisket?

29:26.900 --> 29:31.900
He puts the pussie on the trisket because the trisket can stand up to whatever you want to put on it.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.900
As I understand it, and I don't know his own business.

29:33.900 --> 29:36.900
You can't put a pussie on a rit so it'll shatter.

29:36.900 --> 29:44.900
Trisket has that lattice structure to it that can take what you fucking give it.

29:44.900 --> 29:50.900
Put your pussie on a cracker that can hold it.

29:50.900 --> 29:53.900
That should be Hillary's new platform.

29:53.900 --> 29:58.900
I put my pussie on a trisket or I get the hose again.

29:58.900 --> 30:03.900
It's a silence of the lamp.

30:03.900 --> 30:07.900
You just mentioned Hillary Clinton so that was the other uncomfortable place we could not go

30:07.900 --> 30:09.900
because politics are so fucking boring.

30:09.900 --> 30:13.900
But I just saw an article that I found absolutely fascinating, but I'm not allowed to find it that fascinating

30:13.900 --> 30:20.900
because I'm a fucking dude and my fascination will bleed over into perceived agenda,

30:20.900 --> 30:22.900
which I do not have.

30:22.900 --> 30:24.900
I'm sure I'm seething with agenda.

30:24.900 --> 30:31.900
But my agenda is I love women and hope they love me and wish that they would fucking wish them all the best.

30:31.900 --> 30:34.900
So that's my agenda. I was trying to impress people.

30:34.900 --> 30:39.900
But therefore I found it absolutely fascinating that did you see this?

30:39.900 --> 30:44.900
Maybe it's overhyped, but Madeline Albright and Gloria Steinem,

30:44.900 --> 30:51.900
who are these heroes, the dichotomies are clashing because it's like,

30:51.900 --> 30:58.900
oh, what's more progressive, being out of touch or being a woman?

30:58.900 --> 31:04.900
Because it was essentially like they were, I would use the verb cos being if that didn't now mean something else

31:04.900 --> 31:07.900
before it meant what it means now.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.900
It was like they were like you whippersnappers, you don't know what you're doing.

31:11.900 --> 31:14.900
Like you're fucking up, why are you backing Bernie Sanders?

31:14.900 --> 31:23.900
A lot of the sensationalized out of context pieces are like these very stately,

31:23.900 --> 31:29.900
really respected power women from a much older generation appearing on talk shows.

31:29.900 --> 31:35.900
And I can't remember who it was that was on the Bill Maher show that said like...

31:35.900 --> 31:37.900
Oh, with Gloria Steinem.

31:37.900 --> 31:39.900
She was on.

31:39.900 --> 31:44.900
I think some of these young ladies are backing Bernie Sanders because that's where the boys are.

31:44.900 --> 31:46.900
I don't know if that's a quote.

31:46.900 --> 31:50.900
My dad told me today that there's something called Bernie Bros.

31:50.900 --> 31:53.900
This is a thing and like... That's the guys who dress up like ponies?

31:53.900 --> 31:57.900
Yeah, that's right.

31:57.900 --> 32:00.900
Brrronies.

32:00.900 --> 32:04.900
Yeah, that's right.

32:04.900 --> 32:05.900
Go ahead.

32:05.900 --> 32:11.900
But no, that there's this now like contingent of Bernie supporters who are like,

32:11.900 --> 32:17.900
I don't know, misogynist or something, they're saying that they're like, is that the thing?

32:17.900 --> 32:22.900
And yeah.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.900
Right.

32:25.900 --> 32:31.900
I heard only those two lines, the Gloria Steinem line about the girls just going where the boys are for Bernie.

32:31.900 --> 32:34.900
I've only heard that quote taken just alone.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.900
I don't know what led up to that or what followed that.

32:36.900 --> 32:38.900
Which is an important part of the story.

32:38.900 --> 32:40.900
Which I'm trying to open up to.

32:40.900 --> 32:44.900
That it's out of context and that we're talking about somebody talking for a half hour.

32:44.900 --> 32:50.900
It certainly doesn't sound like Gloria Steinem who's just one of the most famous and awesome feminists of all time.

32:50.900 --> 32:54.900
She certainly... I don't think anyone would want to be courted to say that.

32:54.900 --> 32:58.900
But I do find that... It's a fascinating concept, I guess.

32:58.900 --> 33:01.900
I was like, as a dude, if I was just up here, I find this fascinating.

33:01.900 --> 33:03.900
It's like, oh, yeah, but what's your angle?

33:03.900 --> 33:07.900
What are you trying to prove that feminism is full of shit because women are going to be fighting each other?

33:07.900 --> 33:10.900
She's too smart to have said that and meant...

33:10.900 --> 33:16.900
Leah on the front row is shaking right now. Do you think she actually misspoke and said some terrible shit?

33:16.900 --> 33:22.900
Well, grab a mic. Just say real quick, Leah. This is Leah, everybody.

33:22.900 --> 33:25.900
Hi. Yeah, I listened to it.

33:25.900 --> 33:32.900
And, yeah, no, it was... She was talking really quickly to Bill Maher, so she just wasn't thinking kind of.

33:32.900 --> 33:36.900
And so she was completely sincere and it wasn't really attached to anything, unfortunately.

33:36.900 --> 33:39.900
And everything else she was saying, I was totally agreeing with.

33:39.900 --> 33:42.900
And the point she was kind of making, I think, is that she was talking...

33:42.900 --> 33:44.900
Like, she was at the beginning of the feminist movement.

33:44.900 --> 33:50.900
And so she was saying, like, at the beginning it was just a handful of us and we were like the crazy outsider ladies.

33:50.900 --> 33:55.900
And so she was saying, now it's everyone. You know, now it's like a pretty common movement.

33:55.900 --> 34:04.900
And so if you were around the beginning of the feminist movement, the idea of a female being president is so exciting to me right now because I'm fucking 27.

34:04.900 --> 34:11.900
And like, it hasn't been a female president, and if Hillary's not president, maybe I'm going to be fucking 50 before there's president.

34:11.900 --> 34:14.900
And so that's kind of the point she was making.

34:14.900 --> 34:21.900
But, no, she just literally... It was incredibly offensive and there's not really a way to defend it at all.

34:21.900 --> 34:28.900
Other than that's the point I think she was making was that she fought so hard, you know, to like just like try to get women to where they are.

34:28.900 --> 34:34.900
And so then these young women who have just been born into this kind of perceived state of privilege.

34:34.900 --> 34:39.900
You know, don't understand what a huge deal it is that we even have a woman in the fucking running right now.

34:39.900 --> 34:45.900
And I love Bernie. I love fucking Bernie. You know, like, I love that he's going around saying all this crazy shit.

34:45.900 --> 34:48.900
You also love a nice, cool, coarse light.

34:48.900 --> 34:52.900
I've been drinking all day. I've been at a Super Bowl party, y'all.

34:52.900 --> 34:54.900
There's no better way to wash down a Triske.

34:54.900 --> 34:58.900
No, I'm a wheat thin girl. I'm a wheat thin girl, Jeff.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.900
You're after having eaten that pussy Triske.

35:00.900 --> 35:02.900
Unfortunately, it was just...

35:02.900 --> 35:03.900
I grew up with a bullet.

35:03.900 --> 35:08.900
It was just horribly offensive. It was just like totally out of line and offensive.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.900
Can you say it because I can't...

35:10.900 --> 35:11.900
It's just offensive.

35:11.900 --> 35:16.900
Let me sit back and be fascinated by it. So you're a 27-year-old girl. You don't speak on behalf of all women.

35:16.900 --> 35:18.900
But you are at least...

35:18.900 --> 35:19.900
Not at all.

35:19.900 --> 35:26.900
Like, talk about what's offensive about it.

35:26.900 --> 35:33.900
I think I know, but if I pontificate about it, I sound like a fucking AM radio DJ with some kind of weird agenda.

35:33.900 --> 35:35.900
It's just absurd because...

35:35.900 --> 35:39.900
What? We're just supposed to like Hillary because she has a vagina.

35:39.900 --> 35:43.900
Which is what I just said is partly why I want her to be president.

35:43.900 --> 35:46.900
Because I deserve it.

35:46.900 --> 35:51.900
Just the same way people have talked about how Chris Rock said that there was a black president.

35:51.900 --> 35:52.900
And so that's changed things.

35:52.900 --> 35:57.900
So now little black boys can be like, I could be president, which they didn't have before.

35:57.900 --> 36:00.900
I'm still a woman. I've never had that.

36:00.900 --> 36:03.900
And I want that. And I want my children to have that.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.900
And I want it as soon as fucking possible.

36:05.900 --> 36:07.900
And so I am voting with my pussy.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.900
And I understand that that's inappropriate.

36:09.900 --> 36:12.900
And I also enjoy Bernie. And I like that he's running around.

36:12.900 --> 36:16.900
Saying everyone gets a pony, that's fun.

36:16.900 --> 36:19.900
You're trusting us with the information that you are voting for Hillary and you are doing it for that reason.

36:19.900 --> 36:23.900
Well, I also just dig her. I think she's like a real groovy lady.

36:23.900 --> 36:27.900
And what we talked about when Rhea Butcher was up here, I think...

36:27.900 --> 36:28.900
She said a similar thing.

36:28.900 --> 36:30.900
Basically, yeah.

36:30.900 --> 36:32.900
Because it's like...

36:32.900 --> 36:33.900
Yeah, she was the one, I think.

36:33.900 --> 36:41.900
What the fuck does a president do from top to bottom on the list of things that they accomplished that are the most effective?

36:41.900 --> 36:44.900
Probably number one has to do with symbology and stuff.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.900
Upgrade. Upgrade.

36:46.900 --> 36:50.900
Yeah!

36:50.900 --> 36:52.900
Alright.

36:52.900 --> 36:57.900
But why it was so offensive, which is like incredibly obvious,

36:57.900 --> 37:02.900
is no one saying that like men are voting for Bernie because he has a dick and everyone has a dick.

37:02.900 --> 37:05.900
Fucking Rob Sharob. God damn it.

37:05.900 --> 37:07.900
He's so handsome and fun. That was my point.

37:07.900 --> 37:09.900
I've been drinking all day. I don't know if I said that already.

37:09.900 --> 37:11.900
Sorry, everyone.

37:11.900 --> 37:18.900
Now, tell me, Leah, was Gloria...

37:18.900 --> 37:20.900
Is she pro-Hillary?

37:20.900 --> 37:22.900
Yeah, she is.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.900
Do you think she's saying that?

37:24.900 --> 37:27.900
Like to kind of like say like, hey, like these...

37:27.900 --> 37:32.900
Is she like straight out saying, yeah, these women that are voting for Bernie,

37:32.900 --> 37:34.900
they're just doing it to get laid, but the real women,

37:34.900 --> 37:36.900
the real feminists are over there on Hillary's side.

37:36.900 --> 37:37.900
Is that what she's saying?

37:37.900 --> 37:42.900
The way that I would, you know, most optimistically interpret it was what I already said,

37:42.900 --> 37:45.900
was that she was around for the beginning of the movement where everyone was like,

37:45.900 --> 37:47.900
you should be barefoot and fucking pregnant,

37:47.900 --> 37:52.900
and now we've come such a long way in America where it's more insidious that the hatred of women,

37:52.900 --> 37:54.900
like you can't just overtly see it.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.900
It's been stirred in.

37:56.900 --> 38:00.900
It still exists in a very potent way, but you can't just point at it and be like,

38:00.900 --> 38:02.900
you should be barefoot and pregnant.

38:02.900 --> 38:07.900
We do need to have a female, a woman president as soon as possible because it's been,

38:07.900 --> 38:10.900
you know, we've had what, 48 or 49 in a row.

38:10.900 --> 38:17.900
The idea that she has Madeleine Hulb right thing, there's a special place in hell for women that don't...

38:17.900 --> 38:19.900
Okay, so you saw this too, yeah.

38:19.900 --> 38:20.900
Don't look after the women.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.900
Gloria Steinman's like, yeah, you guys are all being a bunch of dicks.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.900
Like fucking get on board.

38:24.900 --> 38:25.900
But by the way...

38:25.900 --> 38:26.900
Exactly, exactly.

38:26.900 --> 38:28.900
That to me, like, I don't mind that.

38:28.900 --> 38:32.900
I think that's all right because, like, fucking whatever it takes.

38:32.900 --> 38:36.900
Shouldn't they be, shouldn't they be, it's like, I hate to make obvious allegory,

38:36.900 --> 38:41.900
but like when you talk about groups and you talk about interest and you talk about all this shit,

38:41.900 --> 38:45.900
the alienation versus unification and stuff, and I'm a straight white fat male,

38:45.900 --> 38:47.900
I'm just looking at all the rest of it.

38:47.900 --> 38:55.900
But if a 70-year-old Black Panther said, you know, like we used like really rough and tumble in or out language,

38:55.900 --> 38:57.900
you know, would you fault it as much?

38:57.900 --> 38:59.900
And so that was the other fast...

38:59.900 --> 39:02.900
That's why I was like, I'm so fascinated with this story because I'm like,

39:02.900 --> 39:05.900
wait, how am I being fed this on my iPhone next to Amber Alerts?

39:05.900 --> 39:11.900
Is there already a fucking, like, hamster bottle in place where I'm being told,

39:11.900 --> 39:15.900
like, it's the easiest information to get into my mouth that women are fighting again?

39:15.900 --> 39:18.900
Like, boy, are they ever gonna get along or what?

39:18.900 --> 39:22.900
Honestly, and I've been drinking Yale Day, so I can't believe I'm saying this in front of an audience,

39:22.900 --> 39:26.900
but like, I feel like this weird pushback towards Hillary,

39:26.900 --> 39:28.900
and I understand that, like, she...

39:28.900 --> 39:32.900
No, no, Jeff, this is all I have, you have the bottle of vodka, this isn't fair.

39:32.900 --> 39:33.900
I don't have anything.

39:33.900 --> 39:34.900
Jeff, there's a bottle of vodka, right?

39:34.900 --> 39:36.900
I was gonna steal your beer, but it's warm as hell.

39:36.900 --> 39:37.900
Uh, yeah.

39:37.900 --> 39:40.900
Dan, could you maybe pour me some vodka while I continue to...

39:40.900 --> 39:42.900
Yeah, but we got it, we got it.

39:42.900 --> 39:45.900
But, okay, so like, it...

39:45.900 --> 39:47.900
Best intentions is what Jeff was saying.

39:47.900 --> 39:50.900
How many drinks would you say you've had today?

39:50.900 --> 39:52.900
A plethora.

39:52.900 --> 39:54.900
Like, all beer? Have you been doing spirits?

39:54.900 --> 39:56.900
No, it's been like, it's been like vodka.

39:56.900 --> 39:58.900
It's been vodka.

39:58.900 --> 39:59.900
All right, come on.

39:59.900 --> 40:00.900
It's gonna continue to be vodka.

40:00.900 --> 40:01.900
She's not Truman Capote, who cares?

40:01.900 --> 40:03.900
Let's talk to Zoe Lister.

40:03.900 --> 40:05.900
I'm still making good, lucid points.

40:05.900 --> 40:06.900
No, you are.

40:06.900 --> 40:08.900
Oh, god damn it.

40:08.900 --> 40:10.900
All right, that was your drink.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.900
All right, that's...

40:12.900 --> 40:14.900
Yeah, so that was the one for your down homey.

40:14.900 --> 40:19.900
Most optimistically, the way I choose to view what her intention was,

40:19.900 --> 40:21.900
which obviously no one's gonna talk about,

40:21.900 --> 40:25.900
is just that she's thought so hard for like, just even the chance,

40:25.900 --> 40:28.900
even like an inkling that we could ever have a woman president.

40:28.900 --> 40:32.900
And so to her, it's just like appalling that 18-year-old woman would be like,

40:32.900 --> 40:35.900
I like Bernie because, you know, because he makes all these great points

40:35.900 --> 40:39.900
and he's not part of like this corrupt system, you know,

40:39.900 --> 40:41.900
which is all fantastic reasons to vote for him.

40:41.900 --> 40:47.900
And so that's the most genuine, positive way you can view her statements is...

40:47.900 --> 40:51.900
I totally understand that like, we need a fucking woman president as soon as possible

40:51.900 --> 40:55.900
and Gloria Steinem is just like viewing these 18-year-old women being for Bernie

40:55.900 --> 40:57.900
as being like, what are you fucking doing?

40:57.900 --> 40:58.900
Like, we need a woman president.

40:58.900 --> 41:00.900
Like, you don't understand what you're doing.

41:00.900 --> 41:05.900
But then the fact that she said that they're voting for her because...

41:05.900 --> 41:09.900
because they want to impress the boys is so incredibly offensive

41:09.900 --> 41:11.900
because why aren't the boys trying to impress us?

41:11.900 --> 41:15.900
If anything, like the 18-year-old boys are trying so hard to get pussy

41:15.900 --> 41:17.900
that like, I have to try negative amount.

41:17.900 --> 41:21.900
I'm 27 now, I've tried negative amount to get dick my entire life.

41:21.900 --> 41:27.900
Uh, well, I've watched men try like a million times more than me to get pussy

41:27.900 --> 41:30.900
and so, so why would women be voting for Bernie?

41:30.900 --> 41:31.900
What?

41:31.900 --> 41:35.900
Sorry, I was just asking what cracker you think he put dick on.

41:35.900 --> 41:36.900
To me...

41:36.900 --> 41:39.900
Weethins, the best cracker...

41:39.900 --> 41:48.900
I would go lateral and slide it between an inverted pair of baked Pringles.

41:48.900 --> 41:49.900
Yeah, Pringles.

41:49.900 --> 41:50.900
Here's your drink.

41:50.900 --> 41:53.900
Let's have a hand for our election correspondent.

41:53.900 --> 41:55.900
Yeah!

41:55.900 --> 41:57.900
She's been drinking all day.

41:57.900 --> 41:59.900
She's got a room temperature course like.

41:59.900 --> 42:00.900
Thank you.

42:00.900 --> 42:02.900
Yeah, so it was offensive, but I don't think she meant it that way.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.900
Let's not think of as losing a layer.

42:04.900 --> 42:07.900
Let's think of as gaining a Rob Schrab!

42:07.900 --> 42:09.900
Alright.

42:12.900 --> 42:17.900
I'm pretty sure you guys forgot I came tonight.

42:17.900 --> 42:21.900
I'm pretty sure you guys forgot I was in the back room.

42:21.900 --> 42:24.900
No, we were saving like a secret weapon.

42:24.900 --> 42:27.900
I think you guys forgot that I was here.

42:27.900 --> 42:30.900
Can we wrap things up with Zoe so we can focus on you?

42:30.900 --> 42:33.900
Zoe, your name means life.

42:33.900 --> 42:34.900
Yeah.

42:34.900 --> 42:42.900
I learned that from TC2000, the Billy Blank's post-apocalyptic movie from the 90s, direct-to-video.

42:42.900 --> 42:43.900
You should watch that.

42:43.900 --> 42:44.900
Really?

42:44.900 --> 42:45.900
Yeah, you should check it out.

42:45.900 --> 42:47.900
You would really like it.

42:47.900 --> 42:48.900
Is the protagonist named Zoe?

42:48.900 --> 42:51.900
No, it's...no.

42:51.900 --> 42:53.900
His name is TC2000.

42:53.900 --> 42:54.900
TC2000, okay.

42:54.900 --> 42:59.900
But there's a lady in there named Zoe, and Billy Blank says,

42:59.900 --> 43:01.900
your name means life.

43:01.900 --> 43:03.900
That's actually how I learned that.

43:03.900 --> 43:04.900
Is it a Greek root?

43:04.900 --> 43:05.900
What is it?

43:05.900 --> 43:06.900
It is.

43:06.900 --> 43:07.900
It is.

43:07.900 --> 43:08.900
Yeah.

43:08.900 --> 43:11.900
My mom, when I was born, she studied Kabbalah.

43:11.900 --> 43:12.900
Kabbalah?

43:12.900 --> 43:13.900
Oh, God.

43:13.900 --> 43:16.900
She studied Kabbalah for sure.

43:16.900 --> 43:22.900
She studied Kabbalah, and I was going to call it Kabbalah, but then I...

43:22.900 --> 43:27.900
Yeah, she studied that, and you're not supposed to give your kid a name for a week.

43:27.900 --> 43:28.900
Oh.

43:28.900 --> 43:31.900
And you're supposed to name it the shittiest name you can think of.

43:31.900 --> 43:34.900
So that, like, the angel of death passes over.

43:34.900 --> 43:35.900
I love this.

43:35.900 --> 43:41.900
Yeah, so she named me Dirt Pan, which I should have kept.

43:41.900 --> 43:43.900
In English, or there was a Greek version of that?

43:43.900 --> 43:44.900
No, no, in English.

43:44.900 --> 43:45.900
Yeah, we're not Greek.

43:45.900 --> 43:46.900
Dirt Pan?

43:46.900 --> 43:47.900
Yeah, Dirt Pan.

43:47.900 --> 43:50.900
So for a week, they called you, hey, Dirt Pan, pooped your pants again.

43:50.900 --> 43:51.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:51.900 --> 43:52.900
Dirt Pan.

43:52.900 --> 43:53.900
That's so amazing.

43:53.900 --> 43:54.900
I've never heard that before.

43:54.900 --> 43:55.900
Yeah.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.900
I mean, you know, she might have made that, like, Kabbalah law up.

43:58.900 --> 43:59.900
She's blamed it on Kabbalah.

43:59.900 --> 44:01.900
I still believe that.

44:01.900 --> 44:05.900
She was just doing her own pippy log stock in society, and she's like, it's Kabbalah.

44:05.900 --> 44:07.900
Yeah, all of her abusive tendencies, she blamed it on Kabbalah.

44:07.900 --> 44:10.900
And then after a week, she goes, okay, you're not Dirt Pan, you're a life.

44:10.900 --> 44:11.900
Right, yeah.

44:11.900 --> 44:13.900
Well, from Dirt Pan comes life.

44:13.900 --> 44:15.900
Oh, that's so great.

44:15.900 --> 44:21.900
My cat, my cat's name is Fiv, which is F-I-V, because I didn't want to fall in love with her,

44:21.900 --> 44:24.900
because I was told she had F-I-V, which I thought was like H-I-V.

44:24.900 --> 44:28.900
And I thought, like, I rescued this cat, and I was like, I don't want to get attached.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.900
And like, we just started calling it F-I-V or Fiv.

44:31.900 --> 44:32.900
Oh.

44:32.900 --> 44:34.900
And then, you know, let me find out F-I-V.

44:34.900 --> 44:35.900
Oh.

44:35.900 --> 44:36.900
Not that big of a deal.

44:36.900 --> 44:37.900
Oh.

44:37.900 --> 44:41.900
But it was like, but there was a ritual there where it was like, oh, this time went by where

44:41.900 --> 44:46.900
you were like actively saying, and then this like goes back to ancient Greece and whatever

44:46.900 --> 44:47.900
like Oedipus.

44:47.900 --> 44:48.900
Detachment.

44:48.900 --> 44:52.900
Oedipus' name is derived from the fact that his feet were big.

44:52.900 --> 44:55.900
It was because they tied your feet together when they would lay you on a rock for the

44:55.900 --> 44:57.900
wolves, which was a Greek abortion.

44:57.900 --> 45:00.900
Like, they would just go, fuck this kid.

45:00.900 --> 45:01.900
That'd be a name.

45:01.900 --> 45:02.900
Greek abortion?

45:02.900 --> 45:03.900
Yeah.

45:03.900 --> 45:05.900
Instead of debt, dirt pan.

45:05.900 --> 45:06.900
Yeah.

45:06.900 --> 45:08.900
It's like a J-1 on a desk piece.

45:08.900 --> 45:11.900
Okay, it's time to do some Greek abortions.

45:11.900 --> 45:17.900
Okay, this one comes to us from the Acropolis.

45:17.900 --> 45:18.900
What's that?

45:18.900 --> 45:20.900
Third trimester?

45:20.900 --> 45:25.900
Anyways, but that idea that there's like a spirit passing over, and then there's a point

45:25.900 --> 45:28.900
where it's like, oh, this thing's for keeps.

45:28.900 --> 45:32.900
I love that you would have a kid and be like, you're a piece of shit.

45:32.900 --> 45:34.900
Your name's shit face.

45:34.900 --> 45:37.900
And you're like trying to trick the demons.

45:37.900 --> 45:39.900
Oh, that's a shit face.

45:39.900 --> 45:40.900
I don't want that.

45:40.900 --> 45:42.900
And then you're like, the coast is clear.

45:42.900 --> 45:44.900
You're Theodore.

45:44.900 --> 45:46.900
I fucking love that.

45:46.900 --> 45:48.900
I love that so much.

45:48.900 --> 45:49.900
Yeah.

45:49.900 --> 45:51.900
And then she couldn't think of a name.

45:51.900 --> 45:55.900
So I think probably the dirt pan was prolonged longer than it should have been.

45:55.900 --> 46:00.900
But where she got Zoe was like, she was at the back of the baby name book.

46:00.900 --> 46:06.900
They literally refer to you for the first week like your mom and dad were calling you dirt pan.

46:06.900 --> 46:08.900
That's your handle for that first week?

46:08.900 --> 46:09.900
I mean, I think so.

46:09.900 --> 46:12.900
I don't have memories that early, but I think so.

46:12.900 --> 46:14.900
That's what you end up doing with kids anyway, though.

46:14.900 --> 46:15.900
They all have these little names.

46:15.900 --> 46:17.900
They're like, hey, little nook nook.

46:17.900 --> 46:22.900
I was like, why am I nook nook? Well, you used to eat cat shit out of the fucking vent.

46:22.900 --> 46:24.900
And you'd go nook nook.

46:24.900 --> 46:26.900
And you were like, you did shit all over your face.

46:26.900 --> 46:29.900
And we were like, you're a piece of shit.

46:29.900 --> 46:34.900
That's why I love it is because it's like an organic thing that happens where you're like, you're fucking, you're garbage.

46:34.900 --> 46:35.900
Totally.

46:35.900 --> 46:36.900
You're a rug rat.

46:36.900 --> 46:39.900
Yeah, so many people are just like, I mean, hopefully.

46:39.900 --> 46:40.900
Worship kids.

46:40.900 --> 46:41.900
Worshiping kids.

46:41.900 --> 46:43.900
Yeah, you got to give them a shitty name for it.

46:43.900 --> 46:50.900
I used to call my pacifier my noony.

46:50.900 --> 46:53.900
That seems like fine information.

46:53.900 --> 46:55.900
There's no reason to not say that.

46:55.900 --> 46:56.900
That checks out, yeah.

46:56.900 --> 46:58.900
How long did you have your pacifier, Rob?

46:58.900 --> 46:59.900
Like, until what age?

46:59.900 --> 47:00.900
Way too long.

47:00.900 --> 47:02.900
Like, until what age?

47:02.900 --> 47:03.900
12.

47:03.900 --> 47:04.900
No, no, no.

47:04.900 --> 47:05.900
To the point where...

47:05.900 --> 47:06.900
Way too long.

47:06.900 --> 47:11.900
By the time it was taken away from him, its name was Noony Anastasia Henderson III.

47:11.900 --> 47:12.900
Yeah.

47:12.900 --> 47:17.900
Like my mom kept throwing it away, I would dig it out of the garbage and be walking around with the house like,

47:17.900 --> 47:20.900
no, but a thing just sucked my neck.

47:20.900 --> 47:22.900
I had a banky that I didn't want to part with.

47:22.900 --> 47:23.900
Banky?

47:23.900 --> 47:24.900
Banky.

47:24.900 --> 47:25.900
Like a blanket.

47:25.900 --> 47:26.900
Like a little blanket.

47:26.900 --> 47:28.900
Yeah, so mine makes more sense.

47:28.900 --> 47:32.900
Well, that's from Mr. Mom.

47:32.900 --> 47:36.900
That wasn't a movie when I had my banky.

47:36.900 --> 47:38.900
Was it?

47:38.900 --> 47:41.900
They called it a banky in Mr. Mom.

47:41.900 --> 47:42.900
Let's assume I was.

47:42.900 --> 47:43.900
Mine wasn't ripped off.

47:43.900 --> 47:47.900
I actually, my Noony was, I don't remember.

47:47.900 --> 47:49.900
That was original.

47:49.900 --> 47:52.900
So, did you have a banky or a wooby or anything like that?

47:52.900 --> 47:54.900
No, I didn't have any of those things.

47:54.900 --> 47:56.900
You had a dirt pan?

47:56.900 --> 47:57.900
Yeah.

47:57.900 --> 47:58.900
She was a dirt pan.

47:58.900 --> 47:59.900
I was a dirt pan.

47:59.900 --> 48:00.900
Yeah, I didn't need anything.

48:00.900 --> 48:01.900
What is a dirt pan?

48:01.900 --> 48:03.900
Yeah, why do you need a pan to collect dirt?

48:03.900 --> 48:09.900
Well, when you sweep like a dust pan, but I think she thought that dirt pan was even like...

48:09.900 --> 48:10.900
Yeah.

48:10.900 --> 48:11.900
Like a bucket of shit.

48:11.900 --> 48:12.900
Why would you have a bucket of shit?

48:12.900 --> 48:13.900
Yeah.

48:13.900 --> 48:14.900
Who knows?

48:14.900 --> 48:15.900
It's like worthless.

48:15.900 --> 48:16.900
That's my point.

48:16.900 --> 48:17.900
Like dust isn't that bad.

48:17.900 --> 48:23.900
If your parents' friends that are also into Kabbalah come over and like, hey, I've got shit for brands.

48:23.900 --> 48:24.900
It's the best.

48:24.900 --> 48:25.900
It's a fucking best.

48:25.900 --> 48:27.900
But that's what really happens anyway.

48:27.900 --> 48:31.900
When your friends have kids and they're like, do you want to say how to fucking shit fuck?

48:31.900 --> 48:33.900
That's what really happens with your kids, right?

48:33.900 --> 48:34.900
Yeah.

48:34.900 --> 48:35.900
That's what we all do.

48:35.900 --> 48:36.900
Just name them like Little Life Ruiner.

48:36.900 --> 48:37.900
Yeah, something like that.

48:37.900 --> 48:38.900
Yes.

48:38.900 --> 48:39.900
But like...

48:39.900 --> 48:40.900
Yeah.

48:40.900 --> 48:41.900
But we always make those jokes.

48:41.900 --> 48:42.900
Real in a career.

48:42.900 --> 48:45.900
If you go over to your friend's house and you have a six pack and there would be a ballerina.

48:45.900 --> 48:46.900
Yeah.

48:46.900 --> 48:47.900
You want to look at little fuck face?

48:47.900 --> 48:48.900
Yeah.

48:48.900 --> 48:49.900
Yeah.

48:49.900 --> 48:50.900
It's all...

48:50.900 --> 48:51.900
We all talk that way about the little kids.

48:51.900 --> 48:52.900
Yeah.

48:52.900 --> 48:53.900
Pause.

48:53.900 --> 48:54.900
Dream.

48:54.900 --> 48:55.900
Pause.

48:55.900 --> 48:56.900
Dream.

48:56.900 --> 48:57.900
Yeah.

48:57.900 --> 49:00.900
It's sort of like a slam poetry thing going on.

49:00.900 --> 49:01.900
Consumed.

49:01.900 --> 49:02.900
Yes.

49:02.900 --> 49:03.900
All...

49:03.900 --> 49:04.900
Slam poetry would be a great thing.

49:04.900 --> 49:08.900
All we learned about it is that you wrote it and produced it and your husband, who I met back

49:08.900 --> 49:14.900
in college, directed it and produced it, so like independent filmmaking.

49:14.900 --> 49:15.900
Yes.

49:15.900 --> 49:17.400
Where are you at with this?

49:17.400 --> 49:18.400
Where's this movie?

49:18.400 --> 49:20.380
Well, where's this movie?

49:20.380 --> 49:23.900
It's coming out on iTunes and digital platforms March 22nd.

49:23.900 --> 49:25.580
No theatrical release?

49:25.580 --> 49:29.300
We did this cool thing with this company called Gather, which is called Theatrical on Demand,

49:29.300 --> 49:34.060
which is kind of like where indie filmmakers are like headed a lot of the time because

49:34.060 --> 49:38.020
basically it's like crowdsourcing theatrical, a theatrical release.

49:38.020 --> 49:43.100
So you're not relying on a distribution company to put in a few theaters and then be up against

49:43.100 --> 49:44.100
huge tentpole movies.

49:44.100 --> 49:45.100
You're actually...

49:45.100 --> 49:46.100
Is that then...

49:46.100 --> 49:50.540
Does that then allow it to be only in theaters where there is a demand?

49:50.540 --> 49:51.540
Right.

49:51.540 --> 49:53.420
So you can still see the movie that way.

49:53.420 --> 49:55.860
That'll be going on for the next few months, too.

49:55.860 --> 50:01.740
If you just go to the movie's website, consumedthemovie.com, you basically see anywhere in the country

50:01.740 --> 50:05.180
you can type in where you are and you can see if there's a screening and if 60 people

50:05.180 --> 50:06.500
sign up, the screening happens.

50:06.500 --> 50:07.500
Oh, that's awesome.

50:07.500 --> 50:08.500
That's cool.

50:08.500 --> 50:09.500
That's cool.

50:09.500 --> 50:10.500
Let's go at this point.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.500
Yeah.

50:11.500 --> 50:12.500
I mean, it seems like...

50:12.500 --> 50:13.500
Yeah, that's the way it should go.

50:13.500 --> 50:14.500
Especially there's so much content.

50:14.500 --> 50:16.500
So many people are making movies that there's just not enough room for...

50:16.500 --> 50:21.140
Well, also, it's always this tiered thing, like we're still living in this old world thing.

50:21.140 --> 50:25.220
The people who just want to make their movie and distribute it, which is totally great,

50:25.220 --> 50:26.220
it's like...

50:26.220 --> 50:29.980
But we're all drawn into this whole theatrical distribution thing and there's this really

50:29.980 --> 50:31.500
old system where they...

50:31.500 --> 50:36.620
It's a little bit based on making you ashamed of how many people want to come out and watch

50:36.620 --> 50:37.620
your movie.

50:37.620 --> 50:38.620
Yeah.

50:38.620 --> 50:39.620
It's sort of like...

50:39.620 --> 50:42.660
It's like, oh, we'll go to the 20 cities, these three cities, and based on how they

50:42.660 --> 50:46.500
perform, then we'll try to have five cities, then we'll do seven cities, oh, bad news,

50:46.500 --> 50:48.460
guys, a lot of that.

50:48.460 --> 50:53.260
It doesn't have to be that way in a world where George Clooney can get online and go,

50:53.260 --> 50:56.940
if three people give me a dollar for AIDS research, I'll cut my mustache off and put

50:56.940 --> 50:57.940
on a shoe on my head.

50:57.940 --> 50:58.940
It's something...

50:58.940 --> 50:59.940
Everything's real time now.

50:59.940 --> 51:00.940
Totally.

51:00.940 --> 51:04.900
Everyone's picking on people for how they fly or don't fly first class.

51:04.900 --> 51:06.900
You don't have to...

51:06.900 --> 51:08.700
Yeah, no, yeah.

51:08.700 --> 51:14.100
No, it democratizes the process in a really cool way, which is what art should be about.

51:14.100 --> 51:15.100
How did you guys meet?

51:15.100 --> 51:16.100
How did you...

51:16.100 --> 51:23.580
We were just in the back room there and I said, hey, I'm Rob, I'm in the show, and

51:23.580 --> 51:24.580
it's...

51:24.580 --> 51:26.580
Kind of went from there.

51:26.580 --> 51:28.180
Look, I'm a straight shooter.

51:28.180 --> 51:29.580
I don't know her from Adam.

51:29.580 --> 51:30.580
No.

51:30.580 --> 51:31.580
Really?

51:31.580 --> 51:32.580
No.

51:32.580 --> 51:33.580
Really?

51:33.580 --> 51:34.580
Yeah.

51:34.580 --> 51:35.580
No matter.

51:35.580 --> 51:36.580
It's a blind date.

51:36.580 --> 51:37.580
I love it.

51:37.580 --> 51:38.580
Yeah.

51:38.580 --> 51:39.580
Did your husband know about this?

51:39.580 --> 51:40.580
He's here.

51:40.580 --> 51:41.580
He's into it.

51:41.580 --> 51:42.580
Shh.

51:42.580 --> 51:43.580
No, come.

51:43.580 --> 51:44.580
Don't.

51:44.580 --> 51:45.580
Now, is he the Jones?

51:45.580 --> 51:46.580
And you're the Lister?

51:46.580 --> 51:47.580
No, no.

51:47.580 --> 51:48.580
My mom's Lister and my dad's Jones.

51:48.580 --> 51:49.580
They...

51:49.580 --> 51:50.580
My mom didn't want to take my dad's name.

51:50.580 --> 51:51.580
I...

51:51.580 --> 51:52.580
The whispers.

51:52.580 --> 51:53.580
Is your dad renowned in the industry?

51:53.580 --> 51:54.580
No.

51:54.580 --> 51:55.580
No.

51:55.580 --> 51:56.580
No.

51:56.580 --> 51:57.580
That's what I thought.

51:57.580 --> 51:58.580
No.

51:58.580 --> 51:59.580
His name is...

51:59.580 --> 52:00.580
No.

52:00.580 --> 52:01.580
His name is Bill Jones, which is a very common name.

52:01.580 --> 52:02.580
He's a conceptual photographer in New York.

52:02.580 --> 52:03.580
Oh.

52:03.580 --> 52:04.580
Yeah.

52:04.580 --> 52:05.580
He's renowned in that field.

52:05.580 --> 52:06.580
Sure.

52:06.580 --> 52:07.580
Is he renowned or not?

52:07.580 --> 52:08.580
Why'd you man to know?

52:08.580 --> 52:11.580
Is that like a qualification to be on this podcast?

52:11.580 --> 52:12.580
One of your parents has to be renowned.

52:12.580 --> 52:13.580
Yeah.

52:13.580 --> 52:14.580
We have to be able to trace renownment.

52:14.580 --> 52:17.580
That seems to actually be like a big deal.

52:17.580 --> 52:18.580
No.

52:18.580 --> 52:20.580
The truth is, remember when we had Colin Hanks on?

52:20.580 --> 52:21.580
Who's on my show?

52:21.580 --> 52:22.580
He plays my husband on TV.

52:22.580 --> 52:23.580
Yeah.

52:23.580 --> 52:24.580
So, there you go.

52:24.580 --> 52:25.580
That's the connection.

52:25.580 --> 52:26.580
I love men at work.

52:26.580 --> 52:27.580
That's...

52:27.580 --> 52:28.580
All right.

52:28.580 --> 52:29.580
Anyways.

52:29.580 --> 52:30.580
You have a hard out...

52:30.580 --> 52:31.580
You have a 4 a.m. call.

52:31.580 --> 52:32.580
I do.

52:32.580 --> 52:33.580
Yeah.

52:33.580 --> 52:34.580
That's Colin Hay.

52:34.580 --> 52:36.580
It's criminal that you're here from the union standpoint.

52:36.580 --> 52:37.580
Yeah.

52:37.580 --> 52:38.580
What?

52:38.580 --> 52:39.580
I could get arrested.

52:39.580 --> 52:40.580
Colin Hay.

52:40.580 --> 52:41.580
What, Jeff?

52:41.580 --> 52:42.580
Colin Hay is who you're thinking of.

52:42.580 --> 52:43.580
What?

52:43.580 --> 52:46.580
Into the mic, please.

52:46.580 --> 52:47.580
What?

52:47.580 --> 52:50.580
You're thinking of Colin Hay.

52:50.580 --> 52:51.580
For...

52:51.580 --> 52:52.580
Men at work.

52:52.580 --> 52:53.580
Men at what?

52:53.580 --> 52:59.580
Rob and I are doing a sketch show at...

52:59.580 --> 53:00.580
Right now.

53:00.580 --> 53:06.580
You have a 4 a.m. call here in town?

53:06.580 --> 53:07.580
No.

53:07.580 --> 53:08.580
I have a 5 a.m. call.

53:08.580 --> 53:09.580
So, I have to get up at like around 4.

53:09.580 --> 53:10.580
Yeah.

53:10.580 --> 53:17.580
Zoe Lister-Jones, to our handful of listeners that want to go find consumed...

53:17.580 --> 53:18.580
Yeah.

53:18.580 --> 53:21.580
You know, not to put you on the spot, but you know, here's your...

53:21.580 --> 53:23.580
Tell them why to do it, I guess.

53:23.580 --> 53:24.580
Oh, great.

53:24.580 --> 53:25.580
Why?

53:25.580 --> 53:26.580
ConsumeTheMovie.com.

53:26.580 --> 53:27.580
ConsumeTheMovie.com.

53:27.580 --> 53:28.580
It's cool.

53:28.580 --> 53:33.080
Like, harkens back to like, 70's thrillers where people talked about real shit that's

53:33.080 --> 53:34.080
going on in the world.

53:34.080 --> 53:35.080
Where the bad guy was the environment.

53:35.080 --> 53:36.580
GMOs are some real shit, yeah.

53:36.580 --> 53:37.580
Like the prophecy.

53:37.580 --> 53:38.580
Sure.

53:38.580 --> 53:39.580
Yeah.

53:39.580 --> 53:40.580
Not the Christopher Lincoln one.

53:40.580 --> 53:41.580
The prophecy with the guy.

53:41.580 --> 53:42.580
The mutant there.

53:42.580 --> 53:44.580
Or like frogs with Sam Elliott.

53:44.580 --> 53:45.580
Yes.

53:45.580 --> 53:46.580
And Ray Milland.

53:46.580 --> 53:47.580
All right.

53:47.580 --> 53:48.580
Sure.

53:48.580 --> 53:49.580
Yeah.

53:49.580 --> 53:50.580
Exactly like frogs.

53:50.580 --> 53:52.580
With all due respect, I don't think we're going to see any of them again.

53:52.580 --> 53:53.580
Not alive, anyway.

53:53.580 --> 53:57.580
Hey, Sam Elliott, do a commercial for Zoe Lister-Jones.

53:57.580 --> 54:01.580
Oh, oh, God.

54:01.580 --> 54:07.580
If you like Triscuits, well, I know exactly what to put on it.

54:07.580 --> 54:08.580
Oh.

54:08.580 --> 54:09.580
She's tall.

54:09.580 --> 54:10.580
She's pale.

54:10.580 --> 54:11.580
I am pale.

54:11.580 --> 54:12.580
She's lean.

54:12.580 --> 54:13.580
Sure.

54:13.580 --> 54:14.580
She may or may not wear socks.

54:14.580 --> 54:15.580
I can't tell.

54:15.580 --> 54:16.580
But she...

54:16.580 --> 54:17.580
Probably like, yeah.

54:17.580 --> 54:18.580
They're socks.

54:18.580 --> 54:19.580
They're socks.

54:19.580 --> 54:21.580
She hides her socks.

54:21.580 --> 54:26.580
But she's not hiding a new movie called Consume.

54:26.580 --> 54:30.580
Unlike her socks, you can find that online at ConsumeTheMovie.com.

54:30.580 --> 54:31.580
All right.

54:31.580 --> 54:33.580
Zoe Lister-Jones, thanks for coming by.

54:33.580 --> 54:34.580
Zoe Lister-Jones!

54:34.580 --> 54:35.580
Good luck.

54:35.580 --> 54:36.580
Come on.

54:36.580 --> 54:37.580
All right.

54:37.580 --> 54:48.580
Now you can come up and sit up here.

54:48.580 --> 54:55.580
Not until you introduce me.

54:55.580 --> 54:58.580
I don't want him to not come to the show, but also it's just like, I want...

54:58.580 --> 55:00.580
He's being petulant tonight.

55:00.580 --> 55:01.580
I was like...

55:01.580 --> 55:04.580
You guys made me wait.

55:04.580 --> 55:06.580
I went to the bathroom twice.

55:06.580 --> 55:07.580
Dan?

55:07.580 --> 55:08.580
Oh, Dan.

55:08.580 --> 55:09.580
Rob.

55:09.580 --> 55:11.580
The headliner waits to come on last.

55:11.580 --> 55:12.580
Like, maybe we're saving you.

55:12.580 --> 55:15.580
You want me to bring you up first and then in the middle of it?

55:15.580 --> 55:16.580
I've done that before.

55:16.580 --> 55:17.580
I've done that before.

55:17.580 --> 55:18.580
I've brought you up first.

55:18.580 --> 55:19.580
And then I've brought up some guy.

55:19.580 --> 55:23.580
I go like, oh, our next guest has like a weird feeling in his arm.

55:23.580 --> 55:24.580
And he's worried it might be serious.

55:24.580 --> 55:25.580
And then...

55:25.580 --> 55:30.580
And then it's like, you're fucking eating fucking peanuts and...

55:30.580 --> 55:34.580
It's like, it becomes like a sketch and I'm like, I'm a...

55:34.580 --> 55:36.580
I've got nothing to do up there.

55:36.580 --> 55:37.580
I'm just sitting there.

55:37.580 --> 55:39.580
I'm just sitting there like a boob, man.

55:39.580 --> 55:41.580
I don't want to be a boob.

55:41.580 --> 55:43.580
I want to just sit in there, you know?

55:43.580 --> 55:44.580
And my back hurts.

55:44.580 --> 55:45.580
And I'm like...

55:45.580 --> 55:48.580
Yeah, but you chose to sit in a weird...

55:48.580 --> 55:49.580
Chair?

55:49.580 --> 55:50.580
Vice principal.

55:50.580 --> 55:54.580
How many chairs do you... there's not much of a selection.

55:54.580 --> 55:58.580
That's the principal way of doing it is the most comfortable.

55:58.580 --> 56:03.580
Our next guest is popular with listeners.

56:03.580 --> 56:16.580
Let's welcome Rob from the side of the stage to the center of the stage, Rob Schrab.

56:16.580 --> 56:33.580
I think it's better for camera if you sit in one of the more central chairs.

56:33.580 --> 56:37.580
I think Jeff is way too low in this.

56:37.580 --> 56:39.580
I've been watching the monitor.

56:39.580 --> 56:40.580
You're too low, man.

56:40.580 --> 56:41.580
You need to be up.

56:41.580 --> 56:42.580
I think I have too much.

56:42.580 --> 56:45.580
This is a big thing to get around.

56:45.580 --> 56:47.580
There's a giant piece of furniture.

56:47.580 --> 56:48.580
There's a leg thing.

56:48.580 --> 56:50.580
If I sit here, I can't get my leg in there.

56:50.580 --> 56:51.580
Right.

56:51.580 --> 56:52.580
Because there's a big drawer.

56:52.580 --> 56:56.580
Will you do something about this?

56:56.580 --> 57:02.580
If this show required doing things about, I wouldn't be able to do it.

57:02.580 --> 57:03.580
I'm a busy man.

57:03.580 --> 57:07.580
Our logo would be up and not a peanut painting.

57:07.580 --> 57:12.580
By the way, I was told this cost $1,400 not to throw it under the bus.

57:12.580 --> 57:14.580
It's beautiful.

57:14.580 --> 57:21.580
I think it's interesting because when they said that to me, the painting directly behind

57:21.580 --> 57:23.580
you cost $1,400.

57:23.580 --> 57:27.580
I was like, well, I assume all paintings are $1,400.

57:27.580 --> 57:29.580
Isn't that why people paint them?

57:29.580 --> 57:34.580
In the time it took me to smear shit on a canvas, I'd make $1,400.

57:34.580 --> 57:35.580
Too far?

57:35.580 --> 57:36.580
Okay.

57:36.580 --> 57:37.580
All right.

57:37.580 --> 57:38.580
Harmon lost them.

57:38.580 --> 57:40.580
So you don't do a specific thing.

57:40.580 --> 57:45.580
You're all a bunch of Hemingways.

57:45.580 --> 57:46.580
The great painter.

57:46.580 --> 57:48.580
Art doesn't cost $1,400.

57:48.580 --> 57:50.580
What art cost $7,95?

57:50.580 --> 57:54.580
What art cost more than $70?

57:54.580 --> 57:58.580
Dan, what's your favorite Hemingway painting, Dan?

57:58.580 --> 58:08.580
Art of how much does a Hemingway?

58:08.580 --> 58:11.580
Let's all watch this.

58:11.580 --> 58:13.580
Pour that in the air.

58:13.580 --> 58:18.580
After Dan mentioned that the painting is expensive behind, Rob has moved closer to it.

58:18.580 --> 58:20.580
He wants to block it.

58:20.580 --> 58:23.580
Yeah, because it costs money to have it on the air.

58:23.580 --> 58:26.580
No, because it's an artist getting attention.

58:26.580 --> 58:28.580
That is true.

58:28.580 --> 58:30.580
And because it costs $1,400.

58:30.580 --> 58:34.580
I don't think I've ever gotten $1,400 for anything I draw.

58:34.580 --> 58:38.580
Have you ever done canvases like acrylics or oils or anything, Rob?

58:38.580 --> 58:41.580
Maybe in high school.

58:41.580 --> 58:43.580
Would you do one tonight?

58:43.580 --> 58:44.580
Yes.

58:44.580 --> 58:45.580
Okay.

58:45.580 --> 58:46.580
All right.

58:46.580 --> 58:47.580
Sorry.

58:47.580 --> 58:49.580
I'm not doing a good job tonight.

58:49.580 --> 58:50.580
No.

58:50.580 --> 58:52.580
And I'm not ashamed.

58:52.580 --> 58:54.580
All right.

58:54.580 --> 58:55.580
Rob.

58:55.580 --> 59:03.580
What was your favorite sketch?

59:03.580 --> 59:10.580
When I first met Rob and Dan, I walked into a comedy sports improv festival tournament

59:10.580 --> 59:12.580
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

59:12.580 --> 59:13.580
Don't do this.

59:13.580 --> 59:19.580
And I had heard that there was a couple of famous, like, squads, teams.

59:19.580 --> 59:20.580
Ethan, are you filming the whole thing?

59:20.580 --> 59:21.580
No, the whole thing.

59:21.580 --> 59:23.580
Oh, he's got his camera up the whole time.

59:23.580 --> 59:27.580
It's cheaper than paying for it.

59:27.580 --> 59:29.580
But he paid to get it.

59:29.580 --> 59:31.580
It's more expensive to sit where he's sitting.

59:31.580 --> 59:34.580
He's got twice as much to get into the show.

59:34.580 --> 59:36.580
All right.

59:36.580 --> 59:38.580
All right.

59:38.580 --> 59:41.580
I had heard that the New York team was the Bert Firstners.

59:41.580 --> 59:46.580
Like, those guys were supposed to be like, oh, I came from the LA team, which is, you

59:46.580 --> 59:47.580
know, hodgepodge of people.

59:47.580 --> 59:52.580
And I was one of the couple younger, like the whippersnappers on the team.

59:52.580 --> 59:53.580
Right.

59:53.580 --> 59:56.580
But the Milwaukee team had the sketch group, a side group called the Dead Alewives.

59:56.580 --> 01:00:00.580
And that included Rob and Dan and several others.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:03.580
And the Bert Firstners were the side group of the New York team.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:07.580
So I came into a festival very freaked out and nervous because I'd only done comedy

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.580
sports, I think, you know, eight times or something like that.

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.580
I mean, you know, not that many times.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.580
9-11.

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.580
9-11.

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:15.580
Okay.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.580
Wait.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.580
Can you put a pin?

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.580
Yeah.

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.580
You got to put a pin.

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.580
Okay.

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:21.580
Pin.

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:28.580
I texted Bob Saget because I had a picture on my watch of Bob Saget's face because it came

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.580
up.

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:30.580
I'll put a picture on your watch to begin with.

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.580
I'll explain that in a second.

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.580
Okay.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:37.580
But there was a, my Apple Watch, when its software got updated, allowed you to have a photo

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.580
as the watch face.

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.580
Wow.

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:42.580
At 9-11 in the morning.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:43.580
That's great.

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.580
I know.

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.580
Leaps and bounds.

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.580
Yeah.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.580
I went like this one morning, two days, three days ago.

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:54.060
And Bob Saget's face came up and it said 9-11.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:58.580
And I very quickly took a photo of it and I tweeted it to you.

01:00:58.580 --> 01:00:59.580
Yeah.

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.580
I saw that.

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.580
For obvious reasons.

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.580
Spencer.

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:05.580
He's part of the family.

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:12.580
Justin Roiland, who is the one who took a picture of Bob Saget's face from the cover

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.580
of, I think, People.

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.580
And that's why you selected that as your...

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:19.580
Yeah.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.580
Everybody had a reason.

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.580
And Bob Saget.

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.580
I sent it to Bob Saget as well because it's Bob Saget.

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.580
Are you guys palsy lousy?

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.580
No.

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.580
No.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.580
I don't know him.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.580
I saw that.

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:34.580
Halfway through the day, Bob Saget tweeted.

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:38.580
He responded and said, I am honored.

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:44.580
And then he did a bit about like, you're probably the only person that wants to look at my face

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:46.580
in the morning or something like that.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.580
And everybody was like, Bob Saget tweeted you back.

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.580
And I was like, oh, that's great.

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:52.580
Where is that?

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.580
I'm going to retweet his tweeting.

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:56.580
And I scrolled it.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.580
And I was like, where is it?

01:01:58.580 --> 01:01:59.580
What happened?

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:00.580
Where did it go?

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:01.580
He took it down.

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.580
And then everybody was like, wait, wait, what is it?

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:04.580
Yeah.

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.580
No, it was him.

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.580
Was it a fake account?

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.580
No, it wasn't.

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.580
He deleted it.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:11.580
He deleted it because...

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.580
Because he realized after the fact that he was...

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.580
That it was a 9-11 joke.

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:16.580
Yeah.

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.580
He saw his face and didn't see 9-11.

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.580
Then later on he goes, oh.

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:26.580
And so now it's that I told...

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:29.580
Yeah, I just...

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.580
It makes me hate him, right?

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:37.580
Doesn't it make you hate a person?

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.580
Hate might be coming a little hard.

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:44.580
Well, like, I mean, it doesn't make you love him, does it?

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.580
Yeah.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:49.580
Well, also, he's famous for having one of the bluest, most dark, dirty stand-ups in the

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:50.580
world.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.580
I'm honored.

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:55.580
And I was like, okay, that's glib and stuff, but it was like...

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.580
Maybe he is a big...

01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:02.580
Like, he works for a major first responder's charity or something like that.

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.580
What if one of his family died in 9-11?

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.580
Yeah.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.580
Does it know for a fact that he was the one who deleted it?

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.580
What do you mean, sir?

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.580
You think somebody else runs Bob Sagg?

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.580
It's like Twitter?

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:14.580
No, because you tweeted it.

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.580
Oh, you're saying he deleted it on his...

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.580
Yeah, no, yeah.

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.580
The tweet was deleted.

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:19.580
Yeah.

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:24.580
There's a manic depressive in the front row.

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:28.580
Rather than explain everything you asked, it's the quickest way.

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.580
There's a crazy person.

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:38.580
He's got Kleenex boxes on his feet and a dog skull around his chest.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:41.580
Did you fire back at Saggit about this?

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.580
No, but I sent a photo.

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:49.580
I had Justin because at 9-11 p.m., there was a...

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:50.580
Justin tweeted it.

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:51.580
Let's all do it every day now.

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:52.580
Let's just make that a thing.

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.580
That's what I started thinking.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:56.580
He's like, maybe it could be a thing, but then I forgot about it.

01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:00.580
I mean, I would say if you want to, just if you're listening, if you want to...

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:01.580
But I think...

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:05.580
I guess maybe someone from Netflix called him and said, knock it off.

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.580
Knock it off.

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.580
He said, what?

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:08.580
No, I laughed.

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.580
It's great.

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.580
He's like, that's a 9-11 joke.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580
Look at the time.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.580
You narcissist.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.580
Look at the number above your head.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:24.580
But I think it makes me feel like maybe he had something to do with 9-11.

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.580
Because why would you...

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.580
Yeah, because the statute of limitations still hasn't run out on that.

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:30.580
Right.

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.580
He was like, what have you found?

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.580
Saggit's still under investigation because I know he was for a while.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.580
I don't know.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.580
I think he's eluded it.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.580
Yeah.

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.580
And I think questions need to be raised.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.580
I think this might go all the way to the top.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:44.580
It starts with the people associating his face with 9-11.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.580
I'll tell you that.

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:47.580
Anyways.

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.580
I'm...

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.580
All right.

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.580
Please, one of you was talking and now talk more.

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.580
You were telling a story.

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:57.580
I was saying that I walked into a room and I saw...

01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.580
It was like the first night I was there at Milwaukee Comedy Sports and there was a sketch

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.580
happening called The Dead Ale Wives and you two were on stage.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.580
And what would...

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.580
We would have been what, 25, 6, 7, 8, like around that age?

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.580
I was 24.

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.580
You're probably three years old, right?

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:13.580
Yes.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.580
Yeah.

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.580
And so they were up there doing it and I sat down there and I sat in the back and I was

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.580
completely bummed out because I was like, these guys are...

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:20.580
These guys are renegade.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:23.580
These guys are out there and like crazy and stuff like that.

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:26.580
And then I wouldn't like talk to you guys because I was too afraid of you guys.

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.580
We all kind of found like we all ended up hanging out.

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:29.580
But do you guys remember...

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:32.580
Was there a sketch, an Ale Wives sketch that was the two of you?

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:36.580
Did you guys have like a Burton, Ernie, Abbott and Costello kind of...

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:40.580
We had a Fred and Barney one that was pretty accurate.

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:41.580
What was it?

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:42.580
What was that?

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.580
That was just like a post-apocalyptic Flintstone.

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:46.580
Fred and Barney.

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.580
Yeah.

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:48.580
You were Fred, of course.

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.580
But probably not funny, right?

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.580
Oh, no.

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.580
None of those was funny.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:54.580
So, yeah.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:56.580
I mean, it's not like the dead parrot.

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:57.580
We're not going to do anything.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.580
Okay.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.580
It's not going to be funny.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.580
I mean, I don't remember any...

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.580
I mean, like a post-apocalyptic...

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:02.580
Kind of drunk.

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:03.580
Yeah.

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.580
We're all very drunk.

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.580
I'm not saying...

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:09.580
I wasn't trying to pin you to pull out one of your sketches and do, I was having...

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.580
But I think we should...

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:13.580
I think we should do a new sketch called...

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.580
Uh-oh.

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.580
Oh, boy.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:22.580
The Drive-Thru To...

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.580
Now that we're all back together...

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:31.580
Oi!

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.580
Get me some French boys!

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:40.580
He's... he's on the other side of the car.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.580
He's English.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.580
Get me some French boys!

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:47.580
Got it, got it.

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:51.580
That's genius.

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.580
Genius.

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:55.580
That's very good.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.580
But that's not...

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.580
I just sketched it so much better than I thought I would.

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.580
The payoff is so huge.

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.580
It goes places that you don't expect it to go.

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.580
That's what I love about it.

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.580
I love it.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.580
The payoff is so huge.

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:15.580
The payoff is so huge.

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.580
The places that you don't expect it to go.

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.580
That's what I love about the sketch.

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.580
Hello?

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.580
Hello?

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.580
Yeah, are you still open?

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.580
May I help you?

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:31.580
Yes.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.580
We'd like some French fries.

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.580
I'm sorry, we're not open right now.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.580
You should have said that before you let us in.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.580
Well, you didn't ask, did you?

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.580
Boy, ask him when they're open.

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:45.580
Oh.

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:47.580
Oh, I'm sorry, mate.

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.580
We're open for you and not for your friend

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.580
and doesn't know which side of the fucking driver car on.

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.580
That's all right.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.580
What would you like, hon?

01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:59.580
What would I get you?

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.580
Oh, lock me some chips.

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.580
Oh, that's what the fuck he'd say, right?

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.580
Oh, you go together.

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:07.580
Oh, you get chips, you fat.

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.580
Oh, there'll be fucking chips.

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.580
Can you get me a Dior Doctor Pepper?

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.580
Dior Doctor Pepper, he's a...

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:15.580
Oh, oh, oh, he's a right-in, isn't he?

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:17.580
He's a fucking good-in.

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:19.580
Oh, yeah.

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.580
Oh, you're gonna be swimming in

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:23.580
Dior's fucking Dior Doctor Pepper.

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.580
Yeah, well, you fucking can't

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:27.580
spend like his fucking...

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.580
Oh, yeah.

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.580
Oh, oh, oh.

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.580
Yo, yo, yo.

01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:35.580
Yo, give me that.

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:37.580
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:41.580
What do you want?

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.580
Do you guys have shakes?

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:45.580
Sorry, we're not open right now.

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:47.580
Oh!

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:49.580
Oh, you're still there?

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.580
Do we have shakes? Oh, yes, I have a fucking question.

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:53.580
I've got all the shakes you fucking...

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:57.580
What kind of shake would you like, my friend?

01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:59.580
I'd like me a...

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.580
I'd like me a St. Patrick's Shake.

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.580
Or then you're gonna get a fucking St. Patrick's Shake, then.

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:05.580
Oh, thank you very much.

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.580
You're very welcome.

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.580
Thank you very much.

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.580
You're great and a good ATU.

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.580
Oh, thank you very much.

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.580
That'll be two and five pence.

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.580
All right, pay the man.

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.580
Is it two...

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:21.580
So, seven pence?

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:23.580
Sorry, no, no.

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.580
Oi, it is eight seven pence.

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.580
Would you explain to your friend

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.580
how English money works?

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.580
Eight seven pence.

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.580
He says it's seven pence.

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.580
You said two and five pence.

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.580
Two quid five.

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.580
Okay, like...

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:41.580
Pay the man.

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.580
Tears seven pence coming through the pneumatic tube

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.580
underneath the speaker.

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.580
Whoa.

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.580
Whoa.

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:51.580
There's your change.

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.580
Oh, I got...

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.580
I gave him seven pence.

01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.580
Yeah, you gave me too much, you stupid Yankee talk.

01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.580
Yeah, you gave me too much, you stupid Yankee talk.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.580
You asked for two and five pence.

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:03.580
Yeah, you gave me...

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:05.580
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.580
Yeah,

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.580
he don't know what to eat.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.580
He don't know what to eat.

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.580
Oh, oh, oh.

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.580
He don't know what it is.

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:17.580
Where do I pick up

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.580
the food?

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.580
Where do I...

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:23.580
He wants to know.

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.580
He wants to know what a food...

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:27.580
He wants to know what a food...

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:29.580
What the fuck do you think the fucking food cuts?

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:32.580
Where do you pick up the food?

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.580
I'm sorry, we're closing now.

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:46.580
I just gave you seven pants and you gave me change.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:50.580
He wants to know when he can get the food.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.580
And where?

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:55.580
You know what? Fuck it.

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.580
Fuck it.

01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:02.580
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:18.580
Oh shit!

01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:23.580
Oh, oh, oh, oh! He's reloading!

01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.580
Carry guns!

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:30.580
Carry guns!

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:42.580
Are you out now?

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:43.580
Oh shit!

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:14.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.340
AAAAH!

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:17.320
Whoa!

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.320
Whoa, whoa!

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.060
Whoa, whoa!

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.260
Whoa, whoa!

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.740
Whoa, whoa!

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.540
Whoa!

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:31.440
5611

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.240
statue.

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.700
Oh God, Whoa!

01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.420
Wow, wow!

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:41.920
Wow.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.220
Oh.

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:44.160
What?

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.300
Wow!

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:47.820
Whoa!

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:51.560
Whoa...

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:52.860
Whoa...

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.460
What?

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.860
Whoa!

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.240
Whoa...

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.280
Wow!

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:04.880
What?

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:10.620
fellas

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.560
Meow MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.940
distortion

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.700
Would that be all?

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:41.700
Yeah, that will be all for this evening.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:47.340
Oh, Mike, you were fucking dreaming the whole time you were in the drive-thru.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:48.340
You look a fright, sir.

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.340
You look a fright.

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:55.540
Our flight is about to land any second now.

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:58.660
Would you like some peanuts or some water on you?

01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:00.940
Would I like some peanuts?

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:03.540
Would you like my peanuts and some water?

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.740
Would you like my peanuts and some water?

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:08.020
I thought you'd never ask.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.860
I would adore some peanuts.

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:10.860
Okay, here we go.

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:11.860
Here we go.

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:12.860
It's happening right now.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:15.300
It's happening right now.

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:17.940
It's happening right now.

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:20.100
This is a real thing, people.

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.500
It's really happening.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:22.500
Okay.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:27.260
Yes, sir, may I help you?

01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:31.020
Would you like some of my peanuts and your water?

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:36.100
The people across from me are having sex.

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.820
I'm across from you.

01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:41.820
I'm really getting all that peanuts in here.

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:48.500
Hey, it's first class.

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:52.020
Would you like to buy this painting?

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:56.020
It's only $14,000.

01:14:56.020 --> 01:15:03.500
They didn't create Snoopy, but they sure the fuck painted it.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:07.700
Did Charles Schultz ever get $14,000 for a fucking paint?

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:08.700
No.

01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:14.300
Charles Schultz or his family gets none of that money, but good grief, he's going to

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.300
get $14,000.

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:16.820
Good grief, Charlie Brown.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:22.060
Is your first outsider art ripoff scam, Charlie Brown?

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:30.500
Yeah, I feel a little weird about charging $14,000 for somebody else's idea.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:31.500
That's crazy.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.140
I feel a little weird about that.

01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:36.540
Like maybe if it was parody, like if Lucy was sucking a dick or...

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:37.540
All right.

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.100
But there's like a weird skull thing happening there.

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.100
How much?

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.100
Okay, so your name is what?

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:44.420
And how much will you charge for this fan art?

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:45.420
14?

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.420
Okay.

01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:47.420
Okay.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:50.420
Yeah, let's go with like $14,000.

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:59.420
Yeah, well, I don't know, a hush comes over a crowd full of people that lift nothing for

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:00.420
a living.

01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:01.420
Never will.

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:07.180
They're like, wait a minute, oh shit, my Etsy shop just closed.

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.900
No, you're fine.

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:10.900
You're fine.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.620
Keep doing your Mr. T lunchboxes.

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:15.340
And skud shirts.

01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:17.660
Yeah, you know you're doing it.

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:18.660
All right.

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:20.220
Was the sketch, what happened with the sketch?

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.220
I think we're finished.

01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.860
I think, or is this is still it?

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:26.860
Well, now we're on the plane, you just woke up, realized that maybe possibly the whole

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:31.580
drive-thru thing was a fantasy while you were 35,000 feet above the planet.

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:32.580
Right.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.780
Now, I was always in the scene.

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:35.780
Okay, okay.

01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:36.780
All right, but...

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:37.780
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:38.780
Meanwhile, in the cockpit.

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.780
Okay.

01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.780
All right.

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:55.540
Ladies and gentlemen, once again, I remind you, you're on an airplane, you have no control

01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:00.660
of your life, sitting on a black metal tube and flying around, my name's Captain Jenkins.

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:03.460
You're about to fall out of the road.

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:04.980
Shit, what the fuck?

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:05.980
What's your shit?

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:10.580
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,

01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:16.420
ladies and gentlemen, everything's fine, just walk about, what the fuck, what the fuck?

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:17.420
Let me touch you.

01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.420
Sorry, sorry.

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:19.420
Sorry, sorry.

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:20.420
Let me walk about the cabin.

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:21.420
Let me touch you.

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:22.420
Fuck, what the fuck?

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:23.420
Let me touch you, please.

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:24.420
No, you can't.

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:25.420
Let me touch you.

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:26.420
No, what the fuck?

01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:27.420
Let me touch you, please.

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:28.420
The fuck's going on?

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:29.420
I've been waiting my whole life.

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:30.420
It's stupid.

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:31.420
I snuck in from the baggage.

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:32.420
You can't...

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:33.420
I snuck...

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:34.420
You can't get in a cockpit?

01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:35.420
Let me touch...

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:36.420
I snuck in from the baggage.

01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:37.420
Let me...

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.420
I snuck in from the baggage.

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.420
Let me touch.

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.420
The door's locked.

01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.420
Captain, is everything okay in there?

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:44.420
We're busy.

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:45.420
We're busy.

01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.420
We're busy.

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.420
Okay, I'll come back later, Captain.

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:48.420
No, Maggie!

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:49.420
Maggie!

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.420
Let me just touch once.

01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:51.420
Let me just touch you once and I'll go.

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.420
I promise.

01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:53.420
Let me touch once and I'll go.

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:54.420
You shouldn't be alive.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:57.420
You're not even sitting in real space.

01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:58.420
I know.

01:17:58.420 --> 01:17:59.420
I know.

01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:00.420
Let me touch you once and I'll go home.

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:01.420
I promise.

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:02.420
Let me touch.

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:03.420
Let me touch once.

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:04.420
It's okay.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:09.420
It's okay.

01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:14.420
It's okay.

01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:15.420
It's okay.

01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:16.420
It's okay.

01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:17.420
It's alright.

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:18.420
It's alright.

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:19.420
It's alright.

01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:20.420
It's alright.

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.420
It's alright, okay?

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:22.420
It's alright.

01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:23.420
Take a short break.

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:24.420
Okay, I'll be back later, Captain.

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:25.420
I know.

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:26.420
I swear.

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:27.420
Okay, I'll be back later.

01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:28.420
I promise.

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:29.420
Let me just touch once and I'll go home.

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:30.420
I promise.

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:31.420
I promise.

01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:32.420
I promise.

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.420
I promise.

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:35.560
You're my imaginary friend.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.640
You remember.

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.940
But you're not real.

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:41.740
No.

01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:43.260
But I'm here.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.160
Flashback.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.780
Na, na, na, na.

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:51.280
Ah, ah, ah.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.580
Ah, ah, ah.

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:55.920
Chiron, 1975.

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:56.940
Ah, nah, nah, nah.

01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:00.660
Smoke of the water.

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:03.860
Poverty Noticed

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.100
Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff.

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:09.840
Johnson summer camp.

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.160
Just fun.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:14.360
Loser

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:17.860
Interior cabin and that's how

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:18.800
you fold your shirt.

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:23.620
Hey, who W rescued

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:24.560
you working with?

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.720
Oh, nobody.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:28.000
Nobody really likes me.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.840
I just tell people how to fold shirts,

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.200
I guess probably shouldn't complain

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.600
about my lack of popularity.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.120
I don't have a bunkmate.

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:37.880
I don't have a bunkmate.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:48.880
My name's Captain, I hope one day, Captain Dan Harmon.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.760
Mm-hmm.

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:57.040
One day, I'm going to be in charge of all the clouds.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.120
I know you will.

01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.160
I know you will.

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.600
I know you will.

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.760
Captain Harmon, will you be my bunkmate?

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.760
Bunkmate?

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:10.960
Will you be my bunkmate?

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:14.160
Hey, hey, I said lights out.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:18.000
You guys have to pick a bunkmate and get to bed.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I'm going to sit.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.640
This is Jeff Johnson's summer camp.

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.960
I want to take chip.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:26.560
I'm going to set the drapes on fire.

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:27.560
Oh, no.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.560
Oh, that's a fire.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.560
Ah, oh, no.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.560
Oh, no.

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.560
My, no, my, my, my, my, my.

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.560
You did it.

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.560
You did it.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.560
You did it.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.560
Oh, no.

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.560
Oh.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:41.560
Ah, ah.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:49.560
Mama, mama, mama, mama, mama.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.560
Mama.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.560
I didn't do that.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.560
Mama, mama.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:54.560
Mama, mama.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:55.560
Mama.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:59.560
Mama! Mama! Mama!

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:03.560
Mama! Mama! Mama!

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:07.560
Captain Dan Hartman, get out of the fire! Get out of the fire!

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.560
Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama!

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.560
Get out of the fire! Mama! Mama! Mama!

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:19.560
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you very much!

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:23.560
Thank you! Thank you for doing it! Why did you just stand in the fire?

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:27.560
Thank you! I was for a second,

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:31.560
I was animatronic for a second, and then

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:35.560
now I'm back to normal. Two years!

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:39.560
Oh, go ahead, you were going to cut to the meeting.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.560
No, go ahead, don't go ahead. Are you okay? I'll be fine. Go ahead, cut to the...

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:47.560
Are you sure? What's your name? My name's Cletus.

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:51.560
Tell me about yourself. Well, I'm physically

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:55.560
you know, disfigured now for the rest of my life.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:59.560
Captain Hartman, what the hell is going on? And I told you guys lights out. Sir!

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:03.560
He lights up! He lit everything on fire!

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:07.560
Why are all my curtains burned? What did you do to his, Cletus's face?

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:11.560
Um, hello. The curtains can be replaced.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.560
Oh. Sir,

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:19.560
sir, I would never say curtains on fire, sir.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.560
Sir, it's unclear to me if Cletus exists or not.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:27.560
No, I exist, I exist.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:31.560
Well, Cletus says that. I don't know, I think you guys should cut to two years later

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:35.560
and find out.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:39.560
Sir, I just, before we go to two years later,

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:43.560
there must be a reason we touched in here to say that I wish I was

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:47.560
a good car pilot. You want to

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:51.560
be in command of all the clouds. Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:55.560
Yes, sir! Command on clouds, sir! If you think the best path to commanding

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:59.560
all the clouds is to set your bung made on fire,

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:03.560
well, you got another thing coming, mister. Sir, pilot Harmon

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:07.560
has no bunk mate. Sir, pilot Harmon is in charge of his own destiny.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.560
That's what you think.

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:15.560
Woo!

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:19.560
You're in my domain now.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:23.560
Come on, let's go meet the Gelflings.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:31.560
You're never going to flash back to the present ever.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:35.560
Ever! You're never going to flash back to the present.

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:39.560
You're going to stay here with me. Oh, Cletus, who is your friend?

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:43.560
Oh, hello, Lord Gelfling. Nice to meet you.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.560
Gelfling, look at that. And Cletus, what happened to your beautiful face?

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:51.560
I'm a different character, but my

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:55.560
face is beautiful. Okay, I'm sorry. You reminded me of a flashback.

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:59.560
Cletus is all fucked up and melted derma wax face.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:03.560
Look at this angel.

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:07.560
Look at this angel. He looks like somebody who could command a cloud.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:11.560
Yeah, we are having trouble with the clouds.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:15.560
We've lost all control of our clouds. The clouds rain on our parade.

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:19.560
We have a parade? That's how we make power.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:23.560
We've looked at them from both sides now. From up and down and still somehow.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:27.560
Cloud illusions, I recall. I really don't know clouds at all.

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:31.560
Oh!

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.560
Joni Mitchell reference. Oh!

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.560
The clouds in rain!

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:43.560
You can command the clouds. Make the rain go away.

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:47.560
I'd like to go home.

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.560
And I find you racist.

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:55.560
Are you refusing this call?

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:59.560
Wait, we are only an act one?

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:03.560
It's a flashback. What did you want?

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.560
Look.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.560
I am. Okay. Then I guess I can't

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.560
persuade you to stay.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:19.560
Can I go home? No!

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:23.560
Yes. Where do I go?

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:27.560
He wants to know where to go.

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.560
Through the clouds. I'll find it.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.560
I'm not even listening to you. Through the clouds.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:39.560
Wait! I can only go back so far.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.560
You have a button open on your shirt.

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:55.560
Fat shaming.

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:59.560
It gets cold up there. You might want a button on your shirt.

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:03.560
All the way to the bottom.

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:07.560
No one's looking.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:11.560
You can button your shirt now.

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:15.560
Just go ahead. One button.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:19.560
No one will judge you.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:23.560
You have been blocked.

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:27.560
The power

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.560
of the button.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.560
Use this power well.

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:47.560
I will.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.560
Anything else while I'm up?

01:26:51.560 --> 01:27:03.560
I'm going back to my office.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:07.560
He's the top of a beanstalk.

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:19.560
Put it out of your mind.

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.560
I don't.

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:27.560
Okay.

01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.560
Most climbing my spine.

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:35.560
I'm...

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:39.560
I am...

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.560
Who is I am?

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:47.560
Wait! Don't go!

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:51.560
It's fun up here.

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:55.560
You're not even going to try?

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.560
I said to try.

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:03.560
I know where you are and you sound like a sheep.

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:07.560
I'm up above you. You're climbing my vine.

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:11.560
Thank you for letting me climb it. My name is Dan Harmon. I've been through a lot today.

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:19.560
I'm just trying to get down from the cloud world.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.560
Beyond that, I can't really remember.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:27.560
If you want to get down, that's easy.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:31.560
I can't.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.560
No!

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.560
Hello!

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:47.560
Hello?

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.560
Hello?

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:55.560
Hello.

01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:03.560
Hello. Welcome. Welcome to Andromeda Strain.

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:17.560
These are the special extras of Michael Crichton's Andromeda Strain.

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:25.560
Would you like to see a BTS of Andromeda Strain?

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.560
And how they did it?

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.560
Yes, press play.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:48.560
Hi, I'm Michael Crichton. You know what's weird? Science.

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:54.560
Science is strange. Freaks me out. I can't sleep at night.

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:59.560
My wife gets pissed off at me, so I write these books.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:04.560
I don't know. What do you do to get over your problems?

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:17.560
Anyway, I wrote this story called Andromeda Strain about a person named Andromeda who is just like going under a tremendous difficulty in his life.

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:23.560
Just a lot of strain in his life and he's trying to figure out what's going on.

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:31.560
This is the worst. I'm going to watch the original theatrical trailer.

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:40.560
20th Century Fox proudly presents Michael Crichton's Andromeda Strain.

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:47.560
Are you kidding me? These goats can't fly?

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:53.560
They don't. Someone else's will. Andromeda Strain.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:59.560
Your lab results are inaccurate. Your personality is inaccurate too.

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:06.560
Andromeda Strain. I can't feel my passion. Why don't you feel my dick?

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:12.560
Andromeda Strain. The Chinese are everywhere.

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:17.560
Tell him to button his button.

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:24.560
Andromeda Strain. Run like you've got a pair.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:30.560
I'll just... I'll follow what in heaven. Hello beyond there.

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:34.560
Andromeda. Andromeda, you're fired.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.560
Strain.

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:41.560
Strain. Thanksgiving.

01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:00.560
Strain just got a new first name name.

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:05.560
That was good.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.560
Our biggest fan just walked out.

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:18.560
She's had a lot to drink. She's a Hillary voter.

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:23.560
Bullshit. I'm done with this.

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.560
I've had enough of this bullshit. I'm going to take a piss.

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:31.560
Monica, don't. I'm going to take a piss right now.

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.560
We're watching the Andromeda Strain, right? You and I?

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.560
No, I'm taking a piss.

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.560
Okay, but I'm just being... I mean...

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:43.560
I'm taking a piss.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.560
Hey, Monica.

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.560
Yes?

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:51.560
Go ahead and piss, but I wanted to talk to you through the closed bathroom door.

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:53.560
Welcome this way.

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:57.560
We can't just keep doing this, right?

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:02.560
Let's go back to talking about politics.

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:04.560
Oh, no, okay. Anyway.

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.560
I can't do that. You know that.

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:09.560
Well, now you spoiled it.

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:11.560
Yeah.

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:13.560
I thought that's what you like to do. I'm just trying to make you happy.

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.560
I did it.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.560
I tried talking to women about women.

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.560
You're haunting the place like Phantom of the Opera.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.560
You're leaving? You're going to make Lego movies?

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.560
I want to know more about that beanstalk goat.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:29.560
Was he like a guardian of the beanstalk?

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:39.560
I pictured him as some kind of doctor snuggles kind of creature with a long vine growing out of his chin.

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.560
Oh, so the vine didn't grow out of the ground.

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:45.560
It's actually dangling from the chin of a giant cosmic goat.

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:47.560
Right.

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:49.560
That's cool. There's your movie.

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:51.560
Cosmic goat.

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:53.560
Cosmic goat.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:56.560
All right. Well, what did we learn tonight?

01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.560
Here, we'll do a role-playing thing, but I'll be Spencer.

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.560
All right. Let's do it.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.560
Do you have a game platform for us or are you going to freestyle it?

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:08.560
We're going to play laser.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:10.560
Wait, that's already used comedically.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.560
We're going to play gamma world.

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:15.560
Gamma world.

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:16.560
Gamma world.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:18.560
Gamma potato.

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:20.560
Let's play cosmic goat.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:23.560
All right. Here we go.

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:26.560
Dan, do you want some Spencer theme music to start us off here?

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.560
All right. Let's see what I got here.

01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:31.560
Cosmic goat.

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:33.560
Here we go.

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:37.560
In the world of gamma potato,

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:44.560
the world is older than you've ever known.

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:46.560
Give me a second.

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:48.560
I'm glad you could join us.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:54.560
Potatoes are the only thing that seems overtly comical.

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.560
I don't want to do that, the potato thing.

01:34:58.560 --> 01:34:59.560
It seems like the piranha 3D thing.

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.560
It's like, I don't want to play it.

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.560
Gamma world.

01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:07.560
All right. We'll just make it a regular.

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:09.560
Shadow run.

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.560
Reality.

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.560
No, real.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:15.560
Give me a second.

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.560
Super. No, no, no.

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.560
I can beat that.

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:21.560
No.

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:24.560
Christ wars.

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.560
All right.

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.560
Now I'm in.

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.560
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Okay.

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.560
I will be the cross of ice.

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.560
No, no, no.

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:39.560
Let him set it up for us.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:41.560
I won't.

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:43.560
I'm going to let you make your characters in a second.

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:45.560
Okay.

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.560
The two of you have just woken up in a featureless room.

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:52.560
Six feet by six feet.

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.560
A sealed door, although you don't know it's sealed yet,

01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:00.560
is on each wall for a total of four doors.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:04.560
You are both naked, save for a light loincloth.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:08.560
You have holes in your hands and feet.

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:14.560
You look the same except for certain distinguishing tattoos

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.560
on your right and or left biceps.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.560
This is your time to introduce yourselves to each other

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:26.560
as you wake up on the floor of this featureless room.

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.560
Jeff, it's your turn.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:33.560
What's up?

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:38.560
My name is...

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:42.560
Jesus.

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.560
Rob, your character is perceiving a person standing next to you

01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:53.560
saying these things to you and he's just saying these things.

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.560
I have a tattoo of an olive branch on my right bicep.

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.560
I see you have one on your left bicep.

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:02.560
Yes, I do.

01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:04.560
What's your name?

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:06.560
Jesus.

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:12.560
Rob, you feel a burning sensation in your head.

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.560
Yeah.

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.560
Your ancestors are saying to you in the form of a cat.

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:20.560
You see a cat in front of you with his wreath in flame

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:22.560
and he says, don't do that.

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:24.560
Just don't do that.

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.560
Don't do that.

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:28.560
You take 12 damage.

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.560
I should tell you guys there's a series of lights

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.560
in the corners of each corner.

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:44.560
There's a blue light alternately symmetrical with a red light

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:47.560
and a yellow light and it's alternating pattern going across

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:51.560
in the form of like a reverse cross, like a Mercedes symbol

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:56.560
but like flipping back and forth as each time the ceiling rotates

01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:00.560
there's a red, yellow light and a blue light and then a green light.

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.560
In the center of the room there's an orange crystal.

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.560
I pick up the cat and using my unarmed combat...

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.560
You can't pick up a cat.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.560
You can't pick up a cat.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.560
How do you pick up a cat?

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.560
I have plus 22 agility.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.560
You don't see a cat.

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:21.560
There's no cat there to your knowledge.

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.560
Wasn't there a cat telling him what to do?

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:27.560
Rob's cat is like, you don't know.

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.560
It's a hallucinatory cat.

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:35.560
I use unarmed combat and I frontal kick Jesus right in the chest.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.560
Ah, fuck, ow.

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:40.560
He's just...

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.560
Die for my sense.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:47.560
You've received 17 damages, his foot caves into your sternum

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.560
and his heel sinks into your sternum.

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:52.560
Jesus.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.560
That's my name.

01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.560
The two of you are in a very strange situation at this point.

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.560
The ceiling starts to unscrew like a cork,

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.560
like a cap on a cork bottle

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.560
and it goes up as it spins around

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:13.560
and it goes up and a giant character says,

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.560
I want to talk to you about being God.

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.560
You look up and you see a character.

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.560
His head is the size of Pluto.

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.560
His eyes are each planets.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.560
His mouth talks with a giant cave-like venom.

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:37.560
I look up and he says, I want the ruby of Francocon

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:40.560
and I'll stop it, nothing to get it.

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:45.560
He creates a wreath of flame and if that flame dies out,

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.560
you need to save versus burning.

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.560
You both fail to save versus burning.

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:53.560
I haven't had a turn yet.

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:55.560
You're both on fire right now.

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:57.560
I am on fire.

01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.560
I haven't had a turn yet.

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.560
I have trap sense.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.560
Did you roll my trap sense?

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:07.560
You sense that there are such a thing as traps in the universe.

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.560
Good one.

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:13.560
Vorthamama Khan says, I'm going to do this.

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.560
His hand comes out and it's the size of 8 million worlds.

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.560
You're all being pulled into it.

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:22.560
You're all inside a giant hand.

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:26.560
A finger comes inside that hand and you open a door

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:29.560
on the tip of that finger and you go into that finger.

01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:31.560
Now you're inside a big black space

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.560
and there's an orange dot in the northwest corner,

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.560
a green dot 5 meters from that,

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.560
another orange dot in the center of the ceiling.

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:44.560
The whole thing is shaped like an egg but with a pyramid on top of it,

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:47.560
there's two lights that flash in this order.

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:50.560
Green, green, red, red, green, green, blue

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:54.560
and there's a cash register in the center of the room

01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:56.560
doing a Pokemon reference.

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.560
I turn to his citizens and say, I know this one.

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.560
Why did you kick me so hard?

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.560
Because it's Christ wars but I realized just after this whole thing happened

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:10.560
we had to find the ruby of Demorja Khan.

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.560
Can I have my clothes back?

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.560
I give you back your loincloth under one condition,

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.560
that we work together to defeat...

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:22.560
You kicked me in the chest and took my clothes.

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:24.560
Because it's Christ wars.

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.560
Work together?

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:27.560
Now we're working together.

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:30.560
You're telling me to work together after you kicked me in the chest

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.560
and took my clothes.

01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.560
Turn the other chest and let's work together.

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.560
While you guys are talking, the sky is crushing you.

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:46.560
I reach into my butt and I pull out a ruby.

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.560
Okay, you do that.

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:50.560
That happens.

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:52.560
I hold in a loft.

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.560
I still haven't had a turn.

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.560
You've had like nine turns.

01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:58.560
This is free action stuff.

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:00.560
We're not in combat really, I don't think.

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:05.560
Okay, I push you over, take the ruby, give it to him and leave.

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:07.560
I just did that.

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.560
It just happened.

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.560
It happened.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:13.560
It just happened.

01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:15.560
Christ war has been declared.

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:17.560
I'm walking home.

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:24.560
The blackness folds around you, both of you feel like sandwiches inside a toaster.

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:26.560
There's blackness around you.

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:30.560
You can't move or speak for the next seven and a half minutes.

01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:33.560
The eternity is keeping you from doing anything.

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:35.560
I cast toaster speech.

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.560
I cast toaster speech.

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:45.560
Okay, you do that.

01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:48.560
Nothing happens.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:53.560
Blackness continues to surround you.

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:56.560
Eternity moves into night.

01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:00.560
Red lights become blue lights and you move into a new realm.

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:04.560
You look around you, it looks like there's a yellow world.

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.560
It's all yellow, everything's yellow.

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:11.560
If you look around and it's yellow and there's flowers and it feels very yellow.

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:15.560
And a guy comes up to you and goes like, hey, can I get you a pack?

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:17.560
Man?

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.560
I'll take a pack.

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.560
Can we talk now?

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:24.560
You guys are taking damage.

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.560
I'll take one pack.

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:29.560
Oh, okay, you get healed for a thousand points.

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:31.560
Thank you.

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.560
Oh, shit, I'm all healed.

01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:38.560
Fuck, one of my holes is totally healed.

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.560
Are there any exits available to me?

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.560
There are two exits, everything's an exit.

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.560
I take both of them.

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.560
Technically speaking, everything's an exit.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.560
Everything's an exit.

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:01.560
Am I still just wearing a loincloth?

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:06.560
You don't wear a loincloth, it's a loincloth, it's around your loins.

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:08.560
Okay.

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.560
Is the God figure the second?

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:13.560
Is he visible?

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:17.560
The God isn't a figure, there's a God or a figure.

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:18.560
Okay.

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:27.560
I use arcane knowledge to read the surroundings.

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:29.560
What does that mean?

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.560
Tell me what you're doing.

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:36.560
What arcane knowledge are you speaking of?

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:41.560
Just to see if I can read the runes or anything on the walls or anything.

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:44.560
Okay, a serpent is eating you.

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.560
A serpent is eating you.

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.560
As it sinks its teeth into you.

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:55.560
I cast Christ-like surrender and let him eat me.

01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:04.560
I push his head into the mouth of the snake.

01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:06.560
I help him, I help him.

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:08.560
And I say to the snake, I'm being eaten.

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:13.560
By doing this, I will be sitting at the right hand of my father after you digest me.

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:17.560
I help him, I'm pushing as hard as I can.

01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:20.560
I negate my own ego and my five senses.

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:25.560
I attain apotheosis and I transcend.

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:27.560
I'm pushing him into that.

01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:29.560
That happens.

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.560
You all do everything that you just described.

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.560
And as the mouth opens up, you see a sunrise coming up over an orange field.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.560
Oh, that's so beautiful.

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:42.560
I love it.

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.560
A lone black figure bounds up, but he has a horn on his head.

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:49.560
And he says, I'll give you whatever you want.

01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:52.560
My name's Nabisco.

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:55.560
Nabisco?

01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:57.560
Do you have any triscuits?

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.560
I have lots of triscuits.

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:03.560
Nabisco? Can I have a triscuit?

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.560
What's your dexterity?

01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:10.560
You're dying.

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:12.560
I don't care.

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:13.560
You're dead.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:15.560
I don't care.

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:16.560
You're dead.

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:17.560
I am.

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:18.560
That happened.

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:19.560
You're dead.

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:20.560
You're dead too.

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:21.560
You're dead.

01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:22.560
No, I'm not.

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:23.560
Yeah, you are.

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:24.560
Yeah, you are.

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:25.560
No, he's right.

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:26.560
You're dead too.

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:27.560
You're so dead, man.

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:28.560
No, I'm not.

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.560
Right hand of snake god, I'm looking at you.

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.560
You're in heaven.

01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:32.560
I'm looking at a dead guy.

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:33.560
This is the best place ever.

01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:34.560
No, that's not possible.

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:35.560
Yeah, it is.

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:36.560
No.

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:37.560
You just got creep showed.

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:38.560
No.

01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:39.560
You got creep showed, motherfucker.

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.560
No.

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.560
Would you like more diet, Dr. Pepper, sir?

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:47.560
You fucking can't.

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:48.560
You fucking...

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.560
Make an order.

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.560
You're fucking clogging up the queue.

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.560
There's 18 cars behind you.

01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:54.560
Oh, fucking day.

01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.560
I said we weren't closing.

01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:56.560
I'm...

01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:58.560
I'm late for a game.

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:01.560
I just want a burger.

01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:05.560
I was a dungeon master.

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:07.560
A master.

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.560
Yeah.

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:09.560
Yeah, right.

01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:10.560
Sure you were.

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.560
And I'm Jackie Robinson.

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.560
You are.

01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:16.560
You are Jackie Robinson.

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.560
Oh.

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:18.560
And you.

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:21.560
You're that retarded boy I saved from that coal mine.

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.560
Everyone in this room.

01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.560
Everyone in this room is from a previous episode of the show that I star in,

01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:31.560
where I leap from life to life.

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.560
There's only one explanation.

01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.560
This is heaven.

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:40.560
This is heaven.

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.560
I doubted for me to put you out.

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.560
It's heaven.

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:50.560
I go to the bathroom.

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:52.560
You walk into the bathroom.

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.560
The bathroom has three toilets.

01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.560
One toilet is green.

01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:58.560
One toilet is a lighter green.

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:01.560
One toilet is like a sea foam green.

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.560
There's no line in the heavenly bathroom.

01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560
Please, this way.

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:06.560
Let me open it.

01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.560
Give me your hand.

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:14.560
Use the three seashells and go to the bathroom.

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:17.560
You guys are doing two different bits.

01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:22.560
In heaven, bits are in tandem.

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:26.560
I go to the bathroom.

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:27.560
You do that.

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:28.560
I make a pee.

01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:30.560
You make a pee.

01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:32.560
I use the three seashells.

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.560
Which one do you use?

01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.560
The third one.

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:37.560
The sea foam green one?

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:41.560
Underneath the third seashell is a peanut.

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:44.560
That happens.

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:47.560
I leave the bathroom.

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:50.560
And I notice something strange is going on.

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.560
There's something strange going on.

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:53.560
There's something strange going on.

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.560
I'm drying my hands, man.

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.560
That's all I'm doing.

01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:58.560
Just drying my hands.

01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.560
Something strange is going on.

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.560
Someone's drying their hands.

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:03.560
They're just drying their hands.

01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.560
They're drying their hands.

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:06.560
Just drying my hands.

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:07.560
You see a man.

01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.560
He's a small, elven figure in a cloak.

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.560
And he's drying his hands.

01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:16.560
I already know what I see.

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.560
Who are you?

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:20.560
I'm the bathroom attendant.

01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:22.560
Would you like a tic-tac?

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.560
I'm the dungeon master.

01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:27.560
The bathroom attendant starts turning into a troll.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:28.560
What do you do?

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.560
Who are you?

01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:30.560
You can't...

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:31.560
I'm another dungeon master.

01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.560
What? You can't...

01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:35.560
That doesn't happen.

01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:36.560
Yes, it does.

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.560
That does happen.

01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.560
The bathroom attendant turns into a troll

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:43.560
and starts eating your neck.

01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.560
That happens.

01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:47.560
You need to tell me.

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:48.560
I'm your neck.

01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:49.560
I'm your neck.

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:50.560
I'm also a dungeon master.

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:51.560
No.

01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:52.560
This one does happen.

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.560
This one does happen.

01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:54.560
And it passes through me.

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:55.560
That happens.

01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:58.560
I bring out my sword and I charge both of you

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.560
with my sword, which is two dungeon masters.

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.560
The sword has to roll a five or greater.

01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.560
This is the part one of the sword.

01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.560
I'm a dungeon master.

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:10.560
That happens.

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:12.560
This is part two of the sword.

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:15.560
I'm also a dungeon master.

01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:18.560
That doesn't happen.

01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.560
My sword is immobile.

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:23.560
That's what happens.

01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:26.560
That happens.

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:28.560
I said it didn't happen.

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:32.560
Yeah, I said it did.

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:35.560
You seem to be in a strange situation.

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.560
There's dungeon masters everywhere

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:38.560
saying that's happening,

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:39.560
but something's not happening.

01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.560
The movie is about to start.

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:46.560
The lights are flickering up and down.

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:53.560
Are you going to go make it in time?

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.560
Yes.

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:59.560
You sit down and you watch a trailer

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:03.560
for Norm of the North.

01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:08.560
And watch the Revenant.

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.560
I pull a mirror out of my pocket

01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:12.560
and look into it.

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.560
That happens.

01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.560
In the mirror you see a dungeon master.

01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:20.560
It's me.

01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:21.560
Hey.

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:23.560
Why isn't it me?

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:28.560
Hey, I didn't write this dungeon master.

01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:35.560
How are you a master then?

01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:40.560
I checked the mirror for secret doors.

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:43.560
Checking the mirror for secret doors.

01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:44.560
I find a secret door.

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:47.560
The secret door opens with a secret mirror.

01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:49.560
I go behind the secret door.

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:50.560
You do that.

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:53.560
There's a whole chamber of mirrors

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.560
and everything's a mirror.

01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:00.560
Hey, I'm stuck in here too.

01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:03.560
I'm a mirror.

01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:05.560
My name's Amir.

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:08.560
One of the mirrors seems to be different from the mirrors.

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.560
The mirror is talking to you.

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:13.560
Hey, what's going on?

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:17.560
My name's Amir.

01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.560
You know?

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.560
Wait.

01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:24.560
Do you know what I mean?

01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:25.560
Amir.

01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:26.560
My name's Amir.

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:28.560
You mean a Middle Eastern mirror named Amir.

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:29.560
Right.

01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:32.560
I'm just a person named Amir.

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.560
Gotcha.

01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:35.560
I wrote this dungeon.

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:40.560
I just want to make sure that everybody knows that it's spelled like E-M-I-R.

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:41.560
Thank you.

01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:42.560
Okay, good.

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:45.560
While this is happening, all the glass in all the room

01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:48.560
breaks down into individual shards

01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:52.560
and all the shards coalesce into a large thing.

01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:53.560
That's a huge person.

01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:57.560
Hello, I am Gamma Potato.

01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:58.560
Oh, shit.

01:52:58.560 --> 01:52:59.560
What are we going to do?

01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:00.560
I'm Amir.

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:03.560
The last shard monster looks over his shoulders

01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.560
at the Gamma Potato voice and says,

01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:07.560
I didn't say that.

01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:09.560
I'm Mirror Shard.

01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:11.560
I'm Amir.

01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:13.560
We should get along.

01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:18.560
That happens, but it's not supposed to.

01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.560
I'm Amir, man.

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:21.560
I'm Amir.

01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:25.560
While this is happening, the Mirror Shard man points his hands

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.560
in a magical manner at both of you.

01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:29.560
It makes everything explode.

01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:30.560
Everything explodes.

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:32.560
Everything you say makes you explode.

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:33.560
Everything explodes.

01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:35.560
Everything explodes and you're completely alone

01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:36.560
in a black void.

01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:42.560
Shard man, my name's Amir.

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:45.560
You know, my name's Amir.

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:48.560
And there's a bunch of mirrors.

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:50.560
Yeah, okay.

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:51.560
Okay.

01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:52.560
Kind of cool.

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.560
I don't get your point.

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:55.560
I don't get your point.

01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:59.560
Amir sounds like a mirror.

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:00.560
Okay.

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.560
If you say it.

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:04.560
He takes his mirror fist and it grows to the size

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:07.560
of eight million suns and it crushes around you

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:11.560
and it squeezes you and it makes your whole soul die.

01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:12.560
I would think you...

01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:15.560
All of your energy goes away and you can't exist anymore

01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:17.560
and you've never existed across all time.

01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:19.560
You've never existed.

01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:21.560
And you can't speak ever.

01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:28.560
The mirror man rises up and says,

01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:30.560
No, you're mine.

01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:32.560
I finally have you now.

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:36.560
I've got you now.

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:38.560
Cliff Hanger.

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:43.560
This is the regular room.

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:45.560
Oh, yeah.

01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:48.560
To be continued, everybody.

01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:55.560
Let's hear for Rob Schaab, shall we?

01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:58.560
Zoe Lister Jones, Junior Jones.

01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.560
Thank you for joining us.

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.560
Also, I won't be different.

01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:04.560
The Chicago show is coming up when?

01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:05.560
Next Sunday?

01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:06.560
It's next Sunday.

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:07.560
The Chicago show, yes.

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:08.560
In Chicago?

01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:09.560
No.

01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:10.560
Okay, got that right.

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:11.560
No, it isn't.

01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:12.560
Not in prison to ask.

01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:13.560
February 20th.

01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:15.560
February 20th in Chicago, California.

01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:18.560
Chicago Park West, Chicago, America.

01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:19.560
Chicago, Illinois.

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:21.560
Somebody get it right.

01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:23.560
Yeah, bad question to ask anybody on stage.

01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:26.560
Yeah, wherever we are next, look it up.

01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:27.560
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:28.560
I'm Jeffrey Amir.

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:29.560
Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:30.560
Thank you.

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:31.560
Wow.

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:44.560
Did you get any of that?

01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:51.560
It's a good show.
