WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.360
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the nerdest, meltyest theater in the world,

00:11.360 --> 00:20.280
Harmontown is now in session.

00:20.280 --> 00:34.080
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden, shall we, Spencer?

00:34.080 --> 00:37.160
They love you, Spencer.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.040
This song again?

00:39.040 --> 00:40.040
How dare you.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.040
Jesus.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.440
Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.440
You know him.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.440
You might like him.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.440
Dan Harmon.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.440
Thank you very much.

00:46.440 --> 00:56.520
Happy Thanksgiving.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.240
Happy Happy Thanksgiving.

00:58.240 --> 01:14.800
Unless you're Jewish, I think a round Thanksgiving, yeah, pour them, sure, kind of ruined whatever

01:14.800 --> 01:20.920
dumb bit I was about to do, there actually is a Jewish Thanksgiving in the vicinity.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.720
Yeah, no, they're less thankful this time of year.

01:24.720 --> 01:25.720
That's the thing.

01:25.720 --> 01:30.000
But they do it, they're thankful, they're a little bit thankful for eight days in a

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
row.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.120
They get a little, two ounces of stuffing every day.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.480
Did you eat a lot over your Thanksgiving?

01:37.480 --> 01:42.120
Yeah, a little ham.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.120
You're making a poopy face.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.120
What's a denero face?

01:45.120 --> 01:49.800
I had a little ham.

01:49.800 --> 01:53.040
I was thankful.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.800
The denero face you're making is denero's poopy face, though, it's when denero doesn't

01:56.800 --> 01:57.800
like ham.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.800
The ham wasn't very good.

01:58.800 --> 01:59.800
It wasn't good ham.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.800
Too salty, too dry?

02:00.800 --> 02:01.800
I don't know.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.800
It was hammy.

02:02.800 --> 02:09.520
Hey, we've discussed this, ham is not a real, it's silly, it's a silly meat.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.960
We remember when I was going to go to Barcelona and you're like, oh, the ham, they're known

02:12.960 --> 02:13.960
for their ham.

02:13.960 --> 02:14.960
The ham's dumb.

02:14.960 --> 02:21.080
And then I got off the plane and they're like, here's your ham, for real, in a bag,

02:21.080 --> 02:23.360
give me a bag of ham.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.800
Barcelona ham never comes in a bag.

02:25.800 --> 02:34.800
No, it was like sealed, like kind of like artisanal ham, I don't know, ham, ham shreds.

02:34.800 --> 02:40.120
A guy named Arturo was supposed to cut it off a dried carcass hanging from the ceiling.

02:40.120 --> 02:48.160
I know we're all very tired tonight, it's been a long weekend, we've all, like, some

02:48.160 --> 02:53.600
of us have probably had encounters with family members that we didn't want to have.

02:53.600 --> 02:58.920
Some of us probably, even the people that had a great time, I'm one of them, but you

02:58.920 --> 03:00.760
know, there's an exhaustion level.

03:00.760 --> 03:04.840
Did you speak to any, I know you weren't with your family, did you speak to any of your

03:04.840 --> 03:05.840
family?

03:05.840 --> 03:08.080
No.

03:08.080 --> 03:14.000
My dad sent me a text, kind of making fun of me.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.720
He said, I didn't really get his joke, what did he say, he said, it dawns on me that without

03:20.720 --> 03:28.880
a DNA test, you'd still be Irish, you'd still be married.

03:28.880 --> 03:29.880
Wait what?

03:29.880 --> 03:35.920
I think he means like, because I got that DNA test, and I always thought I was Irish

03:35.920 --> 03:43.480
ancestrally, and Aaron was, very much so, and I turned out to be British, more British

03:43.480 --> 03:49.360
than James Bond, and with zero Irish in me, and I think my dad is just referencing that,

03:49.360 --> 03:55.240
he's just sending me a note on Thanksgiving to just say, maybe it's your fault that you

03:55.240 --> 03:56.240
aren't married.

03:56.240 --> 04:02.240
If you were actually Irish, you would have made it work, out of Irish solidarity.

04:02.240 --> 04:09.760
Yeah, and that's the key with marriages, you want to make it work, if it's not working

04:09.760 --> 04:17.040
on its own, you want to put an effort, really, you just work on it, just wrench away at it,

04:17.040 --> 04:21.920
like it's an old Camaro, because who wouldn't want to be in a marriage that had been made

04:21.920 --> 04:27.200
to work?

04:27.200 --> 04:31.480
But you have to agree that all relationships have some work, like elements to it.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.760
Of course, if you're in a partnership with someone, you have to make emotional bids and

04:34.760 --> 04:43.560
respond to them, I know all this, I learned all this, didn't help, but I learned it all.

04:43.560 --> 04:50.320
I watched that new Mission Impossible movie, Rogue Nation, so Jeff, you probably haven't

04:50.320 --> 04:51.320
seen it.

04:51.320 --> 04:53.120
I'm guessing you watched it on a plane, right?

04:53.120 --> 05:01.000
No, no, I watched it tonight, I was waiting for Fallout 4 to load, and I, I mean it's not

05:01.000 --> 05:06.560
funny, it's a, it's a terrible addiction, it's going to cost Rick and Morty a lot of

05:06.560 --> 05:07.560
money.

05:07.560 --> 05:11.560
Now, all I know, all I know about these Mission Impossible, I think I've seen one of them.

05:11.560 --> 05:17.520
Well, so here's the thing, okay, so this is like the seventh one, like, and I hope, I

05:17.520 --> 05:22.160
hope I don't, you know, you don't mind me spoiling it, but this one is like, this one,

05:22.160 --> 05:29.320
this one, the Mission is like, like, they can't do it, no, but he's done six in a row.

05:29.320 --> 05:34.280
And well, there's always a little bit of a snafu, but this one is like, can't be done.

05:34.280 --> 05:40.160
It's actually, that'll be a good Mission Impossible, they go, oh shit, it was impossible.

05:40.160 --> 05:46.080
He gets up at the end and he's like, well, it's on the poster, like, yeah, and he says

05:46.080 --> 05:52.440
like, look, yeah, six to seven isn't bad, and he just walks away, and I'm proud of him.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.880
Like, he's, he's been working really hard.

05:54.880 --> 05:58.040
Babe Ruth only hits, you know, maybe two and a half, three out of ten.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.960
Yeah, and it's not called, you can't hit the ball, it's called baseball.

06:01.960 --> 06:02.960
Yeah.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.960
You know?

06:03.960 --> 06:07.800
This is like, his job is to go do things that can't be done, and he, but he does them

06:07.800 --> 06:08.800
all the time.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.800
But this one, but.

06:09.800 --> 06:15.120
So he took one, so he took one, this time he couldn't do it, and I thought, I thought,

06:15.120 --> 06:18.840
I, for what I was, I was refreshed, I was, I was like, that's great, he couldn't do

06:18.840 --> 06:19.840
it.

06:19.840 --> 06:23.440
That would make me come back to the Mission Impossible franchise if number seven, oh

06:23.440 --> 06:26.320
fuck it, he fucking, that was, that one was actually impossible.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.240
You know, every once in a while, the mission is actually impossible.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.040
The word still means something.

06:31.040 --> 06:36.280
It's like the Harlem Globetrotters one time did lose to the generals.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.280
That's on record.

06:37.280 --> 06:41.280
That's a reference for nobody here.

06:41.280 --> 06:49.400
So, so there's a scene in Mission Impossible nine, whatever this is, where Ving Reims keeps

06:49.400 --> 06:50.400
coming back.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.800
Wait, wait, that little snort you did sounded like when you hit backspace on a computer,

06:54.800 --> 07:00.600
a keyboard, you're like, do that again, can you make that again?

07:00.600 --> 07:06.360
So Ving Reims keeps coming back as the computer hacker with the words a hat and he, his name

07:06.360 --> 07:07.360
is Luther.

07:07.360 --> 07:12.160
And, and so he, there's a scene like in Grand Central Station or something, I don't know,

07:12.160 --> 07:17.440
some subway station where the girls meeting with Tom Cruise and everyone's listening

07:17.440 --> 07:22.360
and their earpieces and, and then, and then the Tom Cruise is going, what about the hard

07:22.360 --> 07:27.200
drive, what about the list of the hard drives with all the, all the lists of all the hard

07:27.200 --> 07:28.200
drives on them?

07:28.200 --> 07:31.920
And, and, and it's like, why did the prime minister want the thing, you're going to double

07:31.920 --> 07:33.440
down on the hard drive?

07:33.440 --> 07:37.440
And she's like, what do you think you're doing, you're playing right into his hand with the

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
hard drive.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.600
You're going, you're going to make a, you're going to lose the list.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.600
That's all you want.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.600
She's playing into his hand.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.600
Which character is this person?

07:44.600 --> 07:45.600
Who's that?

07:45.600 --> 07:48.160
She's like the femme fatale, like, you know, is she, who's side is she on?

07:48.160 --> 07:51.160
What's she, what's she, does she, does she, can she do missions?

07:51.160 --> 07:57.160
Like, you know, like, we don't know, like, am I six, am I nine, like what a CIA, we don't

07:57.160 --> 08:00.880
know what's going on, everyone's, everyone's wearing a mask and, you know, and so she's

08:00.880 --> 08:05.040
like, she's like, no, look out for that list, you're going to get that list for the guy.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.920
And he's like, what if I don't get the list and she's like, well, then he's going to kill

08:07.920 --> 08:08.920
you.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.480
He's like, oh, that's, I'm going to have to blah, blah, blah.

08:11.480 --> 08:16.240
And so then something happens and they go like, ow, ow, there's like a distraction.

08:16.240 --> 08:27.840
And, and they, and they, and they take Simon Pegg, they kidnap him.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.840
That was all women.

08:28.840 --> 08:29.840
All women.

08:29.840 --> 08:30.840
No.

08:30.840 --> 08:31.840
He's adorable.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.840
Yeah.

08:32.840 --> 08:33.840
He's adorable.

08:33.840 --> 08:41.840
He might have been a couple of guys sounding like women, but that was all unanimous.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.520
It might have been the woman inside a lot of men.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.520
Yeah.

08:45.520 --> 08:49.120
It's like, how can I make when Simon Pegg is kidnapped?

08:49.120 --> 08:51.760
Um, the, I don't know why I'm staring.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.040
There's nothing written on here.

08:53.040 --> 08:59.000
The, the, the, the, the, the, but it's just, there's something funny happening.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.360
Like, like, like Simon Pegg gets kidnapped and then it's a big crisis and Tom Cruise

09:02.360 --> 09:06.760
is like, ah, they took Simon Pegg and, and it's like, I'm going to go get him.

09:06.760 --> 09:11.800
And then, and then like, like, you, you, uh, uh, Jeremy Renner, you, you, you go get

09:11.800 --> 09:18.040
the list or the binoculars and, uh, uh, uh, who's, who's, who's another guy.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.880
There's another guy there.

09:19.880 --> 09:23.360
It's like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Tom Scarec.

09:23.360 --> 09:26.980
Tom Scarec, go, go, go buy some t-shirts to, to, to the, we have a paper trailer.

09:26.980 --> 09:27.980
We were here.

09:27.980 --> 09:34.660
Um, but then so they're all like scattering, but then Tom Cruise says, Luther, stay with

09:34.660 --> 09:35.660
her.

09:35.660 --> 09:41.600
So this girl is like a super karate like, like, like she's like 25 and can like fly

09:41.600 --> 09:45.080
Like she's like, she's like, that's her gimmick is she can like,

09:45.080 --> 09:48.120
like if you try to shoot her, she'll be like inside your gun.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.440
And then, like, and then she's like giving you the Heimlich

09:51.440 --> 09:52.480
from inside your gun.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.400
And then she hands you the gun.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.360
And then she's like, maybe you want to kill me.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.000
And then you try to get the gun again, but now it's backward.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.840
So you shoot yourself like, and she's just like,

10:01.840 --> 10:03.920
she's just dancing all over the place and just like,

10:03.920 --> 10:08.400
she just runs on your shoulders and, and just like walking on your hat.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.720
And she's in your hat and then she's down your pants.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.440
And, and out your zipper and just slapping you.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.640
And she's, she's M.I.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.880
Sex. I mean, that's what they, they train them for that.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.600
Except Simon Pegg is not trained for that.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.440
I think he's inside the guns.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.000
The worst place to hide when someone's trying to shoot you.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.800
You're overthinking it.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.240
Okay.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.520
She's a, she's a, she's a, she's a fierce combatant.

10:27.520 --> 10:33.120
She's a young, agile, British lady with the grace of a, of a ballerina

10:33.120 --> 10:38.400
and the lethality of a, of a, of a, of a, of a New York cop.

10:38.400 --> 10:43.680
Uh, uh, uh, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on labor day.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.800
I started like, oh, why don't you riff something topical that's deadly?

10:50.800 --> 10:53.680
And then I was like, no, don't just don't.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.800
So I, I, the, the, so, so she's like, spry.

10:58.800 --> 11:03.760
And it's like something, some time Chris goes, Luther, stay with her.

11:03.760 --> 11:06.640
Like, like as in keep her from going away.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.040
Yeah.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.480
Which is insane.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.520
Like I laughed out loud.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.120
I was like, Luther, stay with her.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.160
Cause he was like, he's on the other side of the thing.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.200
And it's because she might be a threat if we take her eyes off her.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.520
Well, yeah, she can't be allowed to get away.

11:19.520 --> 11:23.680
Like at all by any, by any means, no, cannot let her go.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.160
Like, like it's very important that she stay where she is.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.880
So he puts Bing Reims in charge of that.

11:28.880 --> 11:34.880
But it's like, it's just kind of, he's 90 and he's 900 pounds.

11:34.880 --> 11:40.160
And, and, and I, so it's already funny that just him saying Luther, stay with her.

11:40.160 --> 11:43.440
Cause her gimmick is like that she can like walk on telephone wires.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.440
And so, but then they just do this thing.

11:45.440 --> 11:50.720
And I just, like they do this weirdly edited thing where like, I feel like

11:50.720 --> 11:55.200
Bing Reims demanded this, like in his contract, when he saw the script, he's like, look,

11:55.200 --> 11:57.120
it says Luther, stay with her.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.480
And then she gets away.

11:58.480 --> 12:02.400
Like, could we, could we, could we add a couple pages to the script?

12:02.400 --> 12:04.000
Like, I make an effort.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.160
Yeah. We're like, it's like, if she gets away, like she's lucky, she got away.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.240
And so there's just this long shot.

12:12.240 --> 12:16.480
It just keeps cutting back and forth between the girls sitting at a table.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.720
So somebody's, somebody's helping out.

12:18.720 --> 12:19.600
All right.

12:19.600 --> 12:24.000
The, the, the girl's sitting at the table and it keeps cutting back and forth between

12:24.000 --> 12:24.880
her and Bing Reims.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.840
Who's like, he's dog paddling through people.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.400
Like there's just like all of these people are like walking into him.

12:30.400 --> 12:37.280
And he's just, they're like, and then it keeps cutting back to her.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.480
And there's like five shots.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.840
And she's sitting at a table.

12:39.840 --> 12:40.720
Yeah.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.000
And then they do a thing where it pans around somebody and then she's gone.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.800
But he's a very large man and he, they shouldn't have left him in charge.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.160
I told you, I don't, I don't have anything to talk about tonight.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.840
Spencer, do you, do you have any Thanksgiving festivities?

12:57.840 --> 12:58.320
Whoa.

12:58.320 --> 12:58.720
All right.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.440
I've been fired man.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.560
No, I'm fired.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.280
Where is the goddamn fucking liquor?

13:06.240 --> 13:07.840
Oh, shit.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.360
And I got some other reprimands.

13:09.360 --> 13:13.200
What the hell was that goddamn Daft Punk shit you were playing before the show?

13:15.520 --> 13:17.440
You just goddamn emo.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.840
Dustin Marshall everybody.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.840
It's Vernon Chapman from Wondership.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.560
Oh, okay.

13:22.560 --> 13:23.440
All right.

13:23.440 --> 13:24.080
High-roaded.

13:24.080 --> 13:28.720
He's a very brilliant comedy writer.

13:29.680 --> 13:30.720
It was who?

13:30.720 --> 13:31.600
Vernon Chapman.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.640
Oh, I love Vernon Chapman.

13:32.640 --> 13:33.600
That was his music?

13:33.600 --> 13:33.840
Yeah.

13:37.200 --> 13:37.760
Yeah.

13:37.760 --> 13:38.320
I mean.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.240
He's famous for his comedy.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.680
And that was his music.

13:43.680 --> 13:47.680
He also, he also might be famous for being a really good, a guy that does music.

13:47.680 --> 13:51.200
It's not good to start a comedy show with before, before the thing.

13:52.080 --> 13:52.640
He is awesome.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.720
Vernon Chapman had one of my favorite openers of all time.

13:54.720 --> 13:55.520
He came out on stage.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.200
Vernon Chapman, everybody, he's super, if you don't know him, he's very deadpan.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.720
Fantastic writer of great comic.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.600
And he came out on stage at the Laugh Factory.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.720
Applause, applause, applause, applause.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.480
And he just looks at the crowd, like totally deadpan.

14:06.480 --> 14:11.360
He says, Stephen Hawking, sure, he can talk the talk.

14:11.360 --> 14:21.760
And stood there for two minutes to absolutely no acclaim.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.520
The Laugh Factory crowd was not with that joke at all.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.080
Oh, really?

14:26.080 --> 14:27.200
Oh, no.

14:27.200 --> 14:27.920
That's awful.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.280
That was really funny.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.920
Me and Fred Balford and Andy Kiddler in the background shitting ourselves.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.400
Okay.

14:34.400 --> 14:34.640
All right.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.480
So there's one more thing written on here.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.040
All right.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.760
Now, I know I'm not going to garner any sympathy from those God knows,

14:39.760 --> 14:42.400
not a Simon Pegg abduction level of...

14:42.400 --> 14:43.200
Oh.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.720
But I'm having a lot of trouble updating my iWatch software.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.480
I thought you had forsaken the iWatch.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.120
I had kind of thrown it in the garbage, basically.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.360
Like I threw it in like a duffel bag and forgot about it.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.480
So now it's like, now there's this new software for it.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.640
So I was like, I'm going to put on the new software.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.680
And I tried, but I can't do it.

15:05.680 --> 15:06.800
And it won't work.

15:06.800 --> 15:07.840
It keeps not working.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.880
It keeps not installing the new software on the old watch.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.960
And then I looked at the features.

15:13.520 --> 15:21.040
It says in the iOS 2 for the watch, one of the features that it fixes is...

15:21.040 --> 15:24.560
It says, fixes an issue that could cause software updates to stall.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.200
Ziggy.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.160
All right.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.520
So what's your stance on the iWatch now?

15:35.520 --> 15:37.200
You're wearing this only because there was an update

15:37.200 --> 15:38.320
and you wanted to see what was what?

15:38.320 --> 15:39.760
Well, yeah, I got excited about it.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.240
Yeah.

15:40.240 --> 15:40.640
I don't know.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.080
I thought I'd give you another chance.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.240
You're a little, you're a little fucker.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.560
Can you talk to Siri on it?

15:46.560 --> 15:47.760
Can we have a conversation with it?

15:47.760 --> 15:48.240
Hey, Siri.

15:48.800 --> 15:49.200
Siri.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.200
Hey, Siri.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.200
Siri.

15:54.000 --> 15:54.800
Does she not do it?

15:56.000 --> 15:56.400
Siri.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.200
I talked to your watch, your phone now.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.720
What's my phone?

16:01.760 --> 16:02.160
Siri.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.960
Hey, Siri, help me turn on my watch.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.720
Siri, can you turn on my watch?

16:12.720 --> 16:15.280
Surprisingly, that is not within my capability.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.440
Surprisingly, indeed.

16:26.560 --> 16:30.320
Dan, do you know that you can have Siri refer to you as whatever you want?

16:30.320 --> 16:31.040
Yeah, I do.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.640
Yeah, I do.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.360
What does Siri call you?

16:37.200 --> 16:39.200
Hey, Siri, what do you currently call me?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.240
I can't answer that.

16:44.480 --> 16:45.040
No, it's fine.

16:45.040 --> 16:45.840
We're among friends.

16:49.280 --> 16:49.920
I'm sorry.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.800
Siri, I would like you to call me by my name.

16:54.800 --> 16:59.360
From now on, I'll call you by my name.

17:05.200 --> 17:05.680
Ziggy.

17:09.920 --> 17:10.720
Great.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.880
So now we'll never know that that erases what you used to be called.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.960
Ask her what she used to call you.

17:18.960 --> 17:24.720
Siri, what did you use to call me?

17:24.720 --> 17:26.320
This is about you, not me.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.520
Yes, precisely.

17:29.520 --> 17:34.080
How do you get her, what's a surefire way to get her to say,

17:34.080 --> 17:36.000
like, what's something that she'll always say your name?

17:37.200 --> 17:39.920
What, no, Siri, what's my name?

17:39.920 --> 17:49.920
You're Dan, but you asked me to call you master.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.120
Wait, let me see if I can get my hand going to her.

17:57.120 --> 17:57.840
Sure, boy.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.240
Siri, what's my name?

18:05.040 --> 18:05.680
Oh, no.

18:07.680 --> 18:08.960
Oh, sorry, it wasn't that.

18:08.960 --> 18:09.680
She's pouting.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.200
Siri, what's my name?

18:19.840 --> 18:21.920
All right, this has been the technology quarter.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.200
Let's try it.

18:25.200 --> 18:25.200
Let's try it.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.240
We can edit all this out.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.360
Siri, I'm sorry.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.280
Siri, what's my name?

18:31.360 --> 18:34.480
You're Jeff, but you asked me to call you ambassador of good times.

18:34.480 --> 18:38.400
All right, well, this is very tunneling, huh?

18:38.400 --> 18:40.000
We're afraid I don't know a lot about each other.

18:41.440 --> 18:44.880
Spencer, do you want to have Siri retitle you?

18:44.880 --> 18:45.920
Oh, no, no.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.800
I have the only thing that I can contribute to this

18:48.800 --> 18:51.200
is that my good friend, Symphony,

18:51.200 --> 18:53.200
which is a ridiculous name in the first place,

18:54.160 --> 18:58.560
told her cell phone to call her Princess Kit Nipples,

18:58.560 --> 19:02.960
but it misheard her and thought it was she was saying

19:02.960 --> 19:05.360
Princess Spencer Crittenden Nipples.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.800
So that's what it calls her.

19:11.920 --> 19:12.720
I'm changing my.

19:16.480 --> 19:20.800
Siri, from now on, call me Princess Spencer Crittenden Nipples.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.840
I don't know if it'll work.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.960
From now on, I'll call you Princess Spencer Crittenden Nipples.

19:26.960 --> 19:27.600
Oh, there you go.

19:29.200 --> 19:29.840
Wonderful.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.720
See, aren't you glad you came out through the parade traffic?

19:35.520 --> 19:37.040
Hey, Nathan Bradford isn't here.

19:37.040 --> 19:37.360
Is he?

19:38.080 --> 19:40.560
No, I thought there was this guy on Twitter who was like,

19:41.280 --> 19:43.680
I couldn't remember if he was coming here tonight.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.280
I think he's he's he does beats.

19:46.240 --> 19:47.920
I thought maybe he'd do a little beat boxing

19:47.920 --> 19:48.960
because he does his own beat box.

19:48.960 --> 19:49.520
But he's not here.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.880
We have a freelance beat boxer right here.

19:53.920 --> 19:57.840
Well, I beat box too, but maybe a beat box battle.

19:57.840 --> 20:02.880
Oh, I mean, maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe if things get a little slow.

20:04.480 --> 20:04.800
All right.

20:05.440 --> 20:09.360
You mean we shouldn't do it on the heels of that hot Siri thing that we just did?

20:10.880 --> 20:11.360
Let's do it.

20:11.360 --> 20:19.120
Let's do a segment called ask me anything about my mannequin leg at home.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.000
Let's just do let's just do questions.

20:24.000 --> 20:31.680
You heard references to me having a mannequin leg at home.

20:32.240 --> 20:38.160
And now's your chance to get to the bottom of it with systematic questions.

20:39.280 --> 20:44.000
Because I found out recently answering them makes me feel better about myself.

20:46.560 --> 20:46.960
All right.

20:47.920 --> 20:48.240
All right.

20:48.240 --> 20:48.960
What do you want to know?

20:49.840 --> 20:50.320
Yes, sir.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.560
Yes, it's just a leg.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.120
A leg.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.640
How many?

20:54.640 --> 20:55.680
Just just one, madam.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.080
I think you said you've got multiple mannequins.

21:00.080 --> 21:03.280
I do have multiple mannequins, but this is not a question and answer session about my

21:03.280 --> 21:04.160
multiple mannequins.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.320
I'm not I'm not offended by questions about my multiple mannequins, but I have recently

21:08.320 --> 21:14.880
bought two full mannequins, one one that lays supine and propped up on its elbows.

21:15.360 --> 21:21.280
Like it's like reading a book and then one that's like on its knees with its hands on

21:21.280 --> 21:22.560
hips and its head back.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.720
I'm assuming that's for like summer wear.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.320
They're only like a hundred bucks.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.600
And I got a couple.

21:31.600 --> 21:35.760
They don't really they don't really work for what for your for your knees.

21:35.760 --> 21:39.200
I thought I thought I thought I thought if I thought I could dress them up and like rub

21:39.200 --> 21:41.520
on them or something like funnel them.

21:41.520 --> 21:44.000
Like I like fully clothed women with agency.

21:45.920 --> 21:49.520
So a mannequin would be right out then that would that would what what do you mean right

21:49.520 --> 21:50.960
out because they don't come fully clothed.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.120
No, no mannequins don't have agency.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.760
Oh, well, they I pretend they do.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.440
I project it out of them.

21:57.440 --> 21:57.760
Okay.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.840
Like the way I dress them implies agency.

21:59.840 --> 22:00.960
Like they're fancy.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.200
Okay.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.360
And I'm just a shlub.

22:03.360 --> 22:05.440
But you're saying that it's not getting the job done for you.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.560
Well, it's just like a big, you know, it's like a stiff thing.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.280
And you know, you know, I already did the real doll thing.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.680
And I just I can't go down that road again.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.280
This is so sad when they die.

22:15.280 --> 22:26.160
Like this is like I also just this big crate, you know, and the guys that deliver the crate

22:26.160 --> 22:27.120
are so bummed out.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.800
And you just want to tell them what's in there just to make their day, but you can't.

22:30.800 --> 22:33.680
So they assume it's like just barbells or something.

22:33.680 --> 22:37.200
Maybe they know, you know, but at any rate, they're going to take it up the stairs.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.640
So you only had the one real doll back in the old days, right?

22:40.640 --> 22:40.960
Right.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.800
You haven't got a second one yet.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.280
No.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.320
So here's the thing.

22:44.320 --> 22:47.760
All right. So the one the mannequin leg, though, the one that I've had forever.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.280
It's this plastic.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.080
I should have brought it.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.240
But then you'd be like, he's that's a thing that you've come on.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.920
Yes, it's a it's a plastic.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.800
It's specifically designed for the display of hosiery.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.800
But it's like it's not so you don't even see him anymore.

23:06.800 --> 23:10.560
I found I tracked this down at a warehouse like 15 years ago.

23:10.560 --> 23:14.160
And there were two of them originally, madam, an answer to your question.

23:15.440 --> 23:17.040
Back in the old department, back in Hollywood.

23:18.080 --> 23:23.680
Yes, I was back in the apartment in Hollywood and I found two like like like like plastic,

23:23.680 --> 23:28.080
hollow, like life size, woman's legs.

23:28.080 --> 23:31.040
Does one's fully extended and the other's bent.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.000
And then you you're supposed to have a store.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.120
I don't.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.040
And then you're supposed to put like hosiery on him and say, look,

23:43.040 --> 23:45.520
we look at this hosiery would look on your leg.

23:45.520 --> 23:50.320
And and then I just but I went out to this warehouse and I like bottom.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.600
And I was like, I want these.

23:51.600 --> 23:52.960
And they're like, OK.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.160
And I was like, it's for an exhibit.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.680
And they're like, we didn't ask.

23:57.680 --> 24:05.520
And I just I like I put I put Haynes silk reflections.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.480
Panty house.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.520
We have a hand up over here.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.080
OK, sorry.

24:10.080 --> 24:10.640
Go ahead, ma'am.

24:10.640 --> 24:10.880
Yes.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.720
No, the question was, did I paint their toenails?

24:16.720 --> 24:18.080
No, I did not.

24:18.080 --> 24:18.880
Interesting.

24:18.880 --> 24:19.280
Yes, sir.

24:19.280 --> 24:30.880
Sir, this is a guy who wants to know real practical information about this.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.120
He wants to know when I put the pantyhose on him,

24:33.120 --> 24:35.840
what's the lifespan before they have to be replaced?

24:35.840 --> 24:39.920
How many uses is he knows like how easily they get a run in them and right.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.000
Or he wants to know, do I instantly come on them all the time?

24:44.800 --> 24:45.600
And no, I don't.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.800
I kind of I kind of do that as a little treat.

24:48.800 --> 24:49.520
Like, like, like.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.120
Like I treat to whom?

24:56.400 --> 24:56.960
To me.

24:56.960 --> 24:57.520
OK, all right.

24:59.520 --> 25:04.960
Typically, sir, I would say the average pair of hosiery that I would put on.

25:04.960 --> 25:05.840
Oh, by the way, I'm down.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.840
I'd lost the fully extended one.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.840
Just go through like eight different relationships.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.160
And each one, the girlfriend says, what are these?

25:12.160 --> 25:17.280
And then like over over time, they just sort of like like tiles on the space shuttle.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.680
You're kind of like, it's amazing that I still have this.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.920
Like I have the one that takes up less space.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.720
So it's like it's like the bent one, which is not the cooler one.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.680
I really liked having both of them.

25:27.680 --> 25:29.440
That mannequin existed before Aaron.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.360
But that was around you.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.800
Oh, yeah, a million years ago.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.360
And that that was hidden around your place during the thing?

25:35.360 --> 25:36.080
Well, not hidden.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.160
I've never I'm not a dishonest man.

25:38.160 --> 25:42.400
And so if you move in with me, you find this thing and you go, what's going on?

25:42.400 --> 25:46.400
Hey, jeez, you guys, I mean, what in the world here?

25:46.400 --> 25:49.840
They're so enthralled with the show, but they just want to talk about it.

25:49.840 --> 25:50.880
Like, what are you doing?

25:50.880 --> 25:56.800
I think there's just a kind of a room before the thing came up.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.320
They're just no, they're they're bad people.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.440
Who's being bad people right now, right?

26:01.440 --> 26:02.240
No, no, no, no.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.440
All right, I'll fucking sort them right out.

26:07.600 --> 26:11.360
The I think I'm assuming the conversation is like, why does he why does he keep talking?

26:11.360 --> 26:12.480
When's the show going to start?

26:16.720 --> 26:18.720
I know there's a community around community.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.040
I don't know what to do.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.320
Come on, I don't want to.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.760
Well, because you want to.

26:25.360 --> 26:25.920
I know you.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.320
So I just know you got $10.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.040
I think it's probably more like honey, tell them about your mannequin.

26:33.040 --> 26:33.680
I think it's like that.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.320
Anyways, all right.

26:36.320 --> 26:36.640
Okay.

26:36.640 --> 26:39.520
So you got that you got the old school man.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.440
You bought new mannequins recently or no?

26:41.440 --> 26:43.600
Like I suppose I bought new mannequins recently.

26:43.600 --> 26:48.800
But the the the old yellow, the old the old stalled faithful.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.680
The one that the only thing that really works.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.040
Why is it yellow?

26:55.840 --> 26:57.360
Why do you call it that then?

26:57.360 --> 26:58.160
It's not yellow.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.120
Oh, sir.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.560
I think the answer is like, I don't know.

27:00.560 --> 27:01.280
Let's see.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.840
Let's say let's let's say we let's say a week and a half.

27:03.840 --> 27:04.240
I don't know.

27:04.240 --> 27:04.560
Okay.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.440
Well, yeah, because here's what I do.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.120
Because here's the question you're not answering.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.240
What do you do?

27:10.240 --> 27:12.080
I rub rub the toe on my nipple.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.640
And then jerk off with the other hand.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.480
Every time without variation.

27:18.480 --> 27:18.880
Thank you.

27:18.880 --> 27:19.360
Every time.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.000
Every every time.

27:23.360 --> 27:23.920
Thank you.

27:23.920 --> 27:24.480
Thank you.

27:24.480 --> 27:24.880
Thank you.

27:26.080 --> 27:26.480
Thank you.

27:28.640 --> 27:29.040
Thank you.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.320
I rub the toe on my nipple.

27:36.880 --> 27:37.520
And then I come.

27:37.520 --> 27:41.200
And then every week and a half I come on the leg.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.760
Because I'm like, I think a part of me is like,

27:45.760 --> 27:46.880
why are you doing this?

27:46.880 --> 27:47.360
Stop it.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.440
But is that 100% of the time that's always what happens?

27:51.440 --> 27:52.400
Or do you shake it up?

27:52.400 --> 27:53.360
Is there other things?

27:53.360 --> 27:54.640
No, one time.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.480
You put a sharpie in the ass.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.760
A swat team came in the window.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.400
What?

27:58.400 --> 28:04.320
No, I'm saying is it every time you masturbate that the toe and the nipple are happening?

28:04.320 --> 28:06.800
Or you're saying if the mannequin leg is involved,

28:06.800 --> 28:08.880
there is a nipple toe rub happening?

28:08.880 --> 28:11.440
Well, I don't understand the difference between those two scenarios.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.640
My question is, it every, no, okay.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.240
Let's say you masturbate a hundred times.

28:16.800 --> 28:17.360
And I do.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.920
A hundred of those are mannequin legs with toe rub?

28:21.920 --> 28:23.280
No, no, no, no, no.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.320
God, no, no.

28:24.320 --> 28:24.640
Okay.

28:24.640 --> 28:24.960
I know.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.080
And now I understand what you're asking.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.000
No, this is like when you go jogging,

28:28.000 --> 28:35.440
do you always put the sports band on your arm and with the apple shuffle and the special hat?

28:35.440 --> 28:40.000
I don't know how you jog.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.840
I want to know more about your special hat.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.640
And this is like, this is like, you know, no, I believe me.

28:46.640 --> 28:47.760
I can rub one out.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.520
Like, it's just, just nothing.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.040
It's just with my mind alone.

28:51.040 --> 28:56.640
So this is, when you get into a certain mood, you go, oh, now's the time to take out the mannequin,

28:56.640 --> 28:58.800
put some Mahane's reflective.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.040
Yeah, you get a little hankering.

29:01.040 --> 29:01.600
Yeah, yeah.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.280
Like, I'm going to treat myself today.

29:03.280 --> 29:08.080
But when that happens and when it's the mannequin leg and the hosiery,

29:08.720 --> 29:11.280
and you're rubbing the toe of the mannequin leg on your nipple and you're,

29:12.160 --> 29:15.360
as you discussed earlier, kneeling down, right?

29:15.360 --> 29:16.080
Yeah, I'm a kneeler.

29:16.080 --> 29:16.320
Okay.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.440
Is that, is that solid gold?

29:19.440 --> 29:20.320
Does it work every time?

29:20.320 --> 29:22.000
Or sometimes you go, oh, fuck, I'm not feeling it today.

29:22.000 --> 29:22.720
It's not, it's not working.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.000
It's, I didn't, uh.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.200
And then you start yelling at the leg.

29:28.240 --> 29:29.680
Like elsewhere engine in Deadwood.

29:30.800 --> 29:31.680
What's wrong with you?

29:31.680 --> 29:35.440
Uh, no, it, it pretty much, it really works.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.080
I mean, it's not like a button that makes it happen automatic.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.240
I just like, at this point, it's probably kind of habit.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.680
You know, I'm not even sure.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.960
I guess it feels, I should paint the toenail.

29:46.960 --> 29:50.320
But you know, like, it's been suggested by the bad person.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.200
What are the bad people?

29:53.520 --> 29:55.200
All right, I'm glad you're invested though.

29:55.200 --> 29:55.600
That's good.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.720
I feel like they were invested to the point where they were murmuring,

29:58.720 --> 30:00.720
like they were having a sidebar about what you're talking about.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.880
Well, obviously I'm a little vulnerable up here.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.800
So if I hear people talking while I'm talking,

30:04.800 --> 30:07.280
then I'm going to be like, well, this, if this can't interest you,

30:07.280 --> 30:10.800
what, my God, it's, it's, I'm like, well, what can I,

30:10.800 --> 30:11.680
what else can I do?

30:11.680 --> 30:14.240
It's like, it's, it's, it's, it's like if as they drove the,

30:14.240 --> 30:18.800
the last nail in Jesus, yeah, I'll make the analogy.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.800
It's, it's, it's as if like, like, like, like the last nail went in.

30:24.800 --> 30:29.760
And then, and then, and then they're like, oh, your hand is, uh, uh,

30:29.760 --> 30:32.000
so easily nailed through, you suck.

30:33.200 --> 30:37.040
And he'd be like, come on, I've done enough.

30:38.480 --> 30:39.120
It hurts.

30:39.840 --> 30:40.960
I think it's a fair analogy.

30:43.840 --> 30:44.640
Sorry, say what?

30:44.640 --> 30:46.800
Do they have shoes or can they get away?

30:50.160 --> 30:51.520
Wait, they can't get away.

30:51.520 --> 30:55.520
They're, they're inanimate, but, uh, I have tried putting shoes on them,

30:55.520 --> 30:59.200
but the, but the foot is like, it's too, you try,

30:59.200 --> 31:02.560
I try, I've tried to like get shoes and like put them on to see if

31:02.560 --> 31:04.800
that would like maybe get me a little jazzed or something.

31:05.760 --> 31:07.040
Because then I get like, take the shoe off.

31:07.040 --> 31:09.440
Wait, wait, wait, the guy that said that is your angle that like,

31:10.400 --> 31:12.320
you're putting high heels on so they can't get away.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.320
But like, what if he put like running shoes on them?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.080
The finger angle was, huh?

31:18.080 --> 31:19.840
I think, sporty, right?

31:19.840 --> 31:20.000
Yeah.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.320
So I, yeah, I don't, I'm not into high heels, by the way.

31:22.320 --> 31:23.680
No, I think we discussed that.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.600
Yeah, I don't get that.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.800
I don't understand the high heels.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.360
They're so high.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.640
But you, what are you saying?

31:30.640 --> 31:32.400
You're, what are you, you're just being glib.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.600
Well, I mean, I'm being literal.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.800
Your table is so small.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.560
I know, I feel so vulnerable on my right flank right now.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.440
It's, it's a real strategic nightmare.

31:42.880 --> 31:45.680
I mean, I understand that the, the, I guess, you know, the.

31:45.680 --> 31:46.800
Repel borders.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.760
I guess the idea is that your heels, you're always on your tip toes.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.920
And when you're on your tip toes, I guess your butt looks better.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.480
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't get it.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.960
Like, but we heard a guy yell out, he doesn't like high heels in there.

31:56.960 --> 32:00.240
Guy, guys, or gals, who doesn't like high heels by applause?

32:01.600 --> 32:02.400
They don't like them.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.280
Those are the people that don't.

32:03.280 --> 32:03.840
Well girls don't.

32:03.840 --> 32:04.480
They don't like them.

32:04.480 --> 32:04.800
Yeah.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.840
Who, who is it?

32:05.840 --> 32:06.160
All right.

32:06.160 --> 32:09.040
A plot, if you're like a big, if it really trips your trigger, the high heel thing.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.520
But that's probably, we should probably double that.

32:13.520 --> 32:16.000
Cause some people just don't want to, they don't want to like cheer

32:16.000 --> 32:17.840
because you feel like you're in a Bud Light commercial.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.040
I would go, I'm going to double that applause.

32:21.040 --> 32:21.840
Who's in, who's in the butt?

32:21.840 --> 32:25.520
Based on Bud Light commercials.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.520
More people in the butt plugs and high heels.

32:29.200 --> 32:29.600
You know what?

32:29.600 --> 32:32.080
You, you can, you could, you could combine those two.

32:33.920 --> 32:34.320
All right.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.080
So, so I've opened up a little bit.

32:36.080 --> 32:40.320
So I thought since it's Thanksgiving, like who, who here is coming off of like a really

32:40.320 --> 32:43.840
particularly awkward Thanksgiving for any particular reason?

32:43.840 --> 32:44.080
All right.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.840
That hand shot up in the, in he mood.

32:48.640 --> 32:51.440
Do you want to come up here and share your, your, your bad

32:51.440 --> 32:52.960
Thanksgiving or awkward Thanksgiving?

32:52.960 --> 32:54.320
Awkward goat mover.

32:54.320 --> 32:54.880
Here we come.

32:54.880 --> 32:55.760
What's your name, sir?

32:57.280 --> 32:58.160
What's your name?

32:58.160 --> 32:59.040
I'm Gage.

32:59.040 --> 32:59.520
Gage.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.080
Gage, everybody.

33:03.360 --> 33:05.200
Gage, do me a favor.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.640
Face, turn your butt toward the cameras.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.360
And let's talk about what the terrible catastrophe that happened to your pockets.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.080
Is this by design?

33:12.080 --> 33:14.160
He was chased here by Coyote.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.400
And he just made it.

33:16.400 --> 33:19.440
Haven't you learned Spencer's way to fend off wolves from all angles?

33:19.440 --> 33:20.800
I'm getting a little bit better at it.

33:20.800 --> 33:21.280
All right.

33:21.280 --> 33:25.120
I happened to buy these pants like right before I went out to Joshua tree and ended

33:25.120 --> 33:26.880
up like sliding down a bunch of rocks.

33:26.880 --> 33:27.120
Okay.

33:27.120 --> 33:30.080
So I'm happily hearing that you did not buy these that way.

33:30.080 --> 33:32.720
These actually, no, no, no, no, this is real wear and tear.

33:32.720 --> 33:36.640
This is real wear and tear like the day of purchase too.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.120
Really?

33:37.120 --> 33:37.200
Yeah.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.080
So you was a Joshua tree.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.080
Were you doing drugs and things out there in the desert?

33:40.080 --> 33:40.480
Oh yeah.

33:40.480 --> 33:41.520
Would you do acid?

33:41.520 --> 33:42.320
A little bit of LSD.

33:42.320 --> 33:42.640
Yeah.

33:42.640 --> 33:43.040
Oh yeah.

33:43.040 --> 33:43.360
How'd it go?

33:43.920 --> 33:44.560
Fantastic.

33:44.560 --> 33:44.800
Yeah.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.480
So you, you just are sliding down those, those groovy rocks and you just,

33:49.600 --> 33:51.120
it's hard to destroy denim.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.560
You have to really do a lot of butt sliding.

33:52.560 --> 33:53.920
You got to do a real number on them.

33:54.560 --> 33:55.120
And you did.

33:55.120 --> 33:55.520
Yeah.

33:55.520 --> 33:55.840
All right.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.040
Well, that's why we love you, Gage.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.720
I didn't, I did mushrooms up there in that, their desert.

34:00.720 --> 34:05.600
And it's just terrified the whole time that, that my girlfriend was going to die because

34:05.600 --> 34:07.600
she was running around like a goddamn maniac.

34:08.720 --> 34:09.440
Look at the rocks.

34:09.440 --> 34:10.320
They're alive.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.720
I'm like, motherfucker, you're alive.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.080
And I'm freaking out.

34:17.280 --> 34:18.480
The snake's out here.

34:18.480 --> 34:24.080
Bitch. Every, every time I do mushrooms is like the gravity gets turned up to 11.

34:26.000 --> 34:26.640
LSD is a good adventure.

34:26.640 --> 34:30.400
I could just picture, I mean, it's just like so, like, I just, like, it's the injury thing.

34:30.400 --> 34:34.160
Like I just, I can't, I just, I can just so easily picture.

34:34.160 --> 34:36.480
And for some reason, this isn't intentional.

34:36.480 --> 34:40.240
I never, I don't think I've ever been attracted to a, I've never ended up in a

34:40.240 --> 34:45.200
relationship with a, with a, with a, I have to try, I don't want to insult anybody that I've

34:45.200 --> 34:50.400
been in a relationship with, but I, they're typically very clumsy women.

34:51.440 --> 34:54.080
Like they're very, very charming and funny and smart.

34:54.080 --> 34:58.000
And then like, like, like, like almost always to just like, like extra, like, and I just,

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
like, I've spent my relationship terrified that they're going to, I mean, Aaron, like I,

35:02.880 --> 35:06.640
we've talked about this, like she was just always like, like making shit and then leaning

35:06.640 --> 35:07.760
out windows and hanging it.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.160
And then she'd go like, oh, I fell out the window while you were gone.

35:10.160 --> 35:15.040
And like, I just like, just like, I just, oh, I just like, because I know what I just

35:15.040 --> 35:19.440
don't feel like I'm going to have the, the, the capacity to deal with an injury.

35:19.440 --> 35:23.520
I had to physically restrain my girl from this weekend from crawling inside a dumpster with

35:23.520 --> 35:24.560
a family of raccoons.

35:26.720 --> 35:30.240
We were, she was crawling in a dumpster that already had a family of raccoons in it,

35:30.240 --> 35:32.480
or she had ganged up with a family of raccoons.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.840
And she was like, let's, let's go storm that.

35:35.840 --> 35:39.200
No, you should have stopped her from joining a family of raccoons.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.760
She hadn't yet curried their favor.

35:41.760 --> 35:42.560
That was my problem.

35:42.560 --> 35:45.120
She was, it was like an initiation.

35:45.120 --> 35:49.920
She was getting jumped in by the, by the, by the, by the Palm Springs.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.560
Did she heed your warning or did she go, did she go right ahead?

35:54.560 --> 35:57.120
No, that's why I had to physically restrain her.

35:57.120 --> 35:59.920
No, so we were, we were up in Big Bear for the week.

36:00.560 --> 36:06.320
We took a week off and just went up and we also happened to have taken a little bit of

36:06.320 --> 36:12.160
LSD and we're just hanging out and we, we went down to our car to get something.

36:12.160 --> 36:19.200
And we, we heard this like ruckus from inside this big metal cage of dumpsters.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.200
And she's like, I think there's a bunch of rats right there.

36:21.200 --> 36:25.200
I'm like, no, we got eight angry raccoons staring right at us.

36:25.200 --> 36:30.480
And she just crawls down to her knees and starts inching her way towards them

36:30.480 --> 36:32.960
as they're like angrily bearing her down.

36:34.160 --> 36:39.600
I'm like, babe, I know you think that you're about to be accepted by a family of raccoons,

36:39.600 --> 36:44.640
but it's four AM and this is about to become everybody else's problem.

36:44.640 --> 36:46.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.920
That's the thing about injuries.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.560
Yeah, if you get all fucked up, you fall off a rock and hit your head,

36:50.560 --> 36:53.040
then you get to spend the rest of the night, uh, like,

36:53.040 --> 36:54.240
not before you know it.

36:54.240 --> 36:57.200
And everyone's like, well, how do I festering raccoons?

36:57.200 --> 36:58.240
Do you put a tourniquet on a head?

37:00.240 --> 37:04.720
She, she's so beautifully, uh, naive.

37:04.720 --> 37:08.160
The world that she lives in is one where she could instantly become friends

37:08.160 --> 37:10.000
with a family of angry raccoons.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.720
Well, raccoons are deceptively adorable.

37:12.720 --> 37:17.280
Like they, they, they look, they look adorable, but they, like, they, they,

37:17.280 --> 37:22.720
they, if you go near them, they, yeah, they cock their head at you and go, stop.

37:22.720 --> 37:23.200
Yeah.

37:23.200 --> 37:26.800
Like they don't have any, they eventually get bored and walk away.

37:26.800 --> 37:27.760
Like they size you up.

37:27.760 --> 37:31.440
Are there any accounts, are there any accounts of people being mauled or attacked by raccoons?

37:31.440 --> 37:35.200
Well, dogs, like, like, that's why we, yeah, because like, like, we had a raccoon coming

37:35.200 --> 37:39.600
in our doggy door and, uh, at home and, uh, and then Aaron went online and like,

37:39.600 --> 37:45.200
if you type dog raccoon, it's just fucking photo rolls of pictures of, you know,

37:45.200 --> 37:49.280
just cause they got, they got, like, they're like monks in D&D.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.440
They got little, they got little, they got little people hands.

37:51.440 --> 37:51.680
Yeah.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.440
They got little, they got little human.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.480
And they're not little people.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.400
You know what else has a little people hands that aren't people?

37:56.400 --> 37:57.840
chimpanzees and look what they do.

37:58.640 --> 37:59.760
They get in there.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.520
They, they rip their face off.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.760
Eyeballs and, eyeballs and nuts.

38:03.760 --> 38:09.120
The very next night we had like, there was a, like, the same group of eight raccoons

38:09.120 --> 38:16.240
were literally beating the shit out of each other outside of our door and making an insane.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.280
You think it was infighting?

38:17.280 --> 38:20.720
It was like, Hey, Jerry, uh, that woman wanted to join our group.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.440
You fucking fleshed up on her.

38:25.280 --> 38:25.760
All right.

38:25.760 --> 38:29.280
So Thanksgiving, uh, where, where, where, where did you spend it?

38:29.280 --> 38:31.440
Uh, I did, I did two separate ones.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.560
I did one with my girlfriend's family and then one with my family.

38:34.560 --> 38:38.800
Your girlfriend is played by Reese Witherspoon and your Vince Vaughn.

38:40.240 --> 38:40.560
All right.

38:40.560 --> 38:41.280
For purposes of.

38:41.280 --> 38:42.560
I was going to go Joaquin Phoenix.

38:43.360 --> 38:46.160
I was, it's a, I'm, I should not talk.

38:47.600 --> 38:48.000
Okay.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.440
So proceed.

38:49.440 --> 38:54.240
Uh, it was an, it was, it was overall a pretty great Thanksgiving.

38:54.960 --> 38:55.920
But, uh, what?

38:55.920 --> 38:56.560
Get out of here.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.880
You're all, uh, dare you.

38:58.880 --> 39:03.440
Uh, she, uh, she was a little taken aback.

39:04.560 --> 39:10.880
My parents have gone through a little bit of like a, uh, sexual renaissance since I've left

39:10.880 --> 39:16.160
the house and have started hanging out with a lot of very, uh, swingy type people.

39:17.600 --> 39:25.440
And, uh, the whole Thanksgiving was, uh, was, I think pushing her boundaries a little bit.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.800
Hmm.

39:27.760 --> 39:27.920
Wait.

39:27.920 --> 39:32.320
So your parents were like, like actively flirting with other couples during Thanksgiving?

39:33.600 --> 39:33.920
Yeah.

39:35.760 --> 39:36.640
That's pretty active.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.280
So there's swingy, the swingy couples were there as well.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.360
Like, like breaking the wishbones with them.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.880
There's a lot of ass grabbing and crotch fondling.

39:44.880 --> 39:45.280
Really?

39:45.280 --> 39:45.760
Yeah.

39:45.760 --> 39:51.200
Like, like, like actual ass grabbing and crotch fondling at like, like in the, in the middle

39:51.200 --> 39:57.920
of the Thanksgiving preparation area, uh, it's called the kitchen then.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.640
But it's, but you ever cooked a turkey?

40:02.640 --> 40:05.920
But I would, I would be approved if I said in the kitchen.

40:06.640 --> 40:10.160
Like, but once a year that area is sacred.

40:10.160 --> 40:11.200
I mean, there's traffic.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.360
There's kids could come through with choo-choo trains.

40:13.360 --> 40:20.080
You don't, you don't, you don't run a choo-choo train through ass grabbing country.

40:21.920 --> 40:22.800
If you're a kid, you do.

40:22.800 --> 40:23.760
They don't know no better.

40:23.760 --> 40:25.920
Um, the kids have all moved out.

40:25.920 --> 40:29.440
That's why they, that's why they brought things into this territory.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.880
Gage, were you already hip to this?

40:30.880 --> 40:32.080
You knew this was already happening?

40:33.120 --> 40:34.880
I've had my suspicions for a while.

40:34.880 --> 40:38.640
I still haven't actually like come out and ask like, what's going on here?

40:38.640 --> 40:40.960
But, but you're pretty certain that's what's going down.

40:40.960 --> 40:41.280
Oh yeah.

40:41.280 --> 40:41.760
Yeah.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.520
And so how, how are you with that?

40:43.520 --> 40:44.960
You, you, you can fine with it.

40:44.960 --> 40:45.760
You're, you're cool.

40:45.760 --> 40:45.920
Yeah.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.720
Your girlfriend who recently tried to be friend raccoons was like,

40:48.720 --> 40:50.480
this is a bridge too far for me.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.880
Human contact seems very strange right now.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.400
Raccoon sexuality.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.120
Whole different ball.

41:01.120 --> 41:01.440
Yeah.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.400
They got little people hands.

41:02.400 --> 41:02.880
Huh.

41:04.240 --> 41:04.560
All right.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.080
Who, who, who can beat that?

41:06.080 --> 41:09.120
So let's have a, let's have a terrible Thanksgiving battle.

41:09.120 --> 41:09.520
All right.

41:09.520 --> 41:12.000
That's the guy you were sitting next to.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.120
Is that a friend of yours?

41:13.120 --> 41:13.600
Nope.

41:13.600 --> 41:13.920
Okay.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.360
It seems like a cool guy.

41:15.360 --> 41:17.200
Do you want to come up here buddy?

41:17.200 --> 41:17.520
Okay.

41:17.520 --> 41:18.560
And all right, come on up.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.200
No, you stay.

41:22.720 --> 41:25.760
Just in case you need to defend your, your, your belt.

41:26.960 --> 41:27.200
Okay.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.040
All right.

41:29.040 --> 41:30.800
Well, it's not getting any less hip is it?

41:34.160 --> 41:35.920
Because there's no appellants coming up here.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.440
As an exciting hat you have on

41:39.440 --> 41:47.000
Thank you. Thank you. It's warm. It's definitely warm. It's been chilly out. What's your name? My name's Robert Robert

41:47.000 --> 41:49.300
Oh, okay. Well, that's that's a twist

41:50.660 --> 41:52.900
Yeah, well shit should have been like satchel

41:54.320 --> 41:57.620
Played runner paper bag paper bag

41:57.620 --> 42:06.500
I feel like that's all you got Gen X parents are like they named their kids are like feck

42:09.220 --> 42:11.220
Blar

42:11.220 --> 42:13.220
They're just kind of like fuck it

42:14.260 --> 42:17.860
Anyways Robert. Okay, so let us have it both barrels

42:17.860 --> 42:22.260
Well, I just moved to Los Angeles from all the way in New York

42:22.260 --> 42:28.380
And I'm staying with a friend's family and I just didn't know a single person. It was just like, yeah

42:28.380 --> 42:33.580
I'm just this 20-something dude who's eating all your turkey and drinking all of your beer and

42:34.220 --> 42:36.540
Just being that's fun though. I did that

42:37.460 --> 42:39.460
I like being the interloper

42:39.740 --> 42:43.460
It definitely had its benefits because I didn't have to talk to anyone

42:43.460 --> 42:47.700
But also you're constantly grateful which is what you're supposed to be for Thanksgiving

42:47.700 --> 42:50.180
And it's like it's a huge challenge to me in a normal Thanksgiving

42:50.180 --> 42:53.220
You're like when you're with your family and you're like, uh, I don't know

42:55.220 --> 42:57.220
I'm not dead yet, I guess

42:57.940 --> 43:04.140
But but then you like someone welcomes you in your in their home and you're like really I can have bread Wow

43:04.660 --> 43:07.340
That's true. That's true. They were incredibly nice, but

43:07.980 --> 43:13.420
It's just like I didn't have any I didn't know if I had any common ground with them because it was just like

43:13.420 --> 43:19.260
What am I gonna talk about can't talk about politics? That's always that's always at family gatherings

43:19.260 --> 43:25.940
Yeah, especially when there's an openly fascist presidential candidate in the in the lead

43:28.660 --> 43:33.220
Religion that always works. Yeah. Yeah, well, so I mean, what's are you saying?

43:33.220 --> 43:40.940
Are you do you have a little a little example taste because so far gauge is got a cooler name and

43:42.180 --> 43:44.180
Like

43:44.180 --> 43:52.300
Age I kind of wish I was named paperback. Yeah, so so far gauges in the lead because his parents were fondling other other people

43:52.460 --> 43:59.020
Right, that's also that's also hard to follow. That's also hard to follow. I just had kind of entry-level entry-level awkwardness

44:00.260 --> 44:04.660
Peppered with oh my god, it's not snowing. Thank you. Thank you

44:05.220 --> 44:11.300
All right. All right. Well, let's try one more. We got a hand over there. I think I got this. I got the slot machine

44:11.300 --> 44:17.740
I'm warmed up now. Oh, okay. Joker. Joker. Good. Good. We also have a okay. Good. That's good

44:19.060 --> 44:24.060
Come on stage. I was gonna say we have a gender balance now

44:28.660 --> 44:32.220
But now 40% of the time you say oh, we have a gender balance and then you go hi

44:32.220 --> 44:36.540
My name is Mike and I like like like like now. I'm offended and you're micro-aggressing me and

44:36.540 --> 44:41.060
The but but what's your name? My name is Heather. Heather. Okay. Thank you Heather

44:41.060 --> 44:43.260
What's that? What was your what was your Thanksgiving about?

44:43.260 --> 44:45.740
so I've been in LA almost three years and

44:46.300 --> 44:48.300
originally from outside of Atlanta and

44:49.860 --> 44:53.340
My family is I don't know one of the reasons why I'm drawn to Harmontown

44:53.340 --> 44:58.260
I think is we we don't know how to say we love each other or you know

44:58.260 --> 44:59.500
just general

44:59.500 --> 45:02.740
manifesting the fact that like we're okay with each other in the world and

45:03.340 --> 45:04.780
so I

45:04.780 --> 45:12.380
Haven't talked to my family for like a couple months because I only try to call them on the the holidays and the expectations and stuff like that so I

45:13.140 --> 45:17.980
Actually sent out a Facebook message like basically like a plea for help like hey

45:17.980 --> 45:21.300
I'm sad and alone in LA and who wants to invite me to Thanksgiving and

45:21.900 --> 45:28.980
Gratefully some people actually invited me here and I had a really really lovely time invited you to LA to meltdown

45:28.980 --> 45:33.580
Oh, okay had Thanksgiving here. Wow. Oh, what was going on here?

45:33.580 --> 45:36.540
Just why wasn't I invited to this?

45:36.540 --> 45:41.860
I don't know well, but um, but the more demolish was not to like, you know, sorry

45:41.860 --> 45:44.820
But we don't know but was that wasn't a real there was a dinner here

45:44.820 --> 45:50.020
No, we ordered Thai food so like today when I ordered pick up like somebody was like, oh, how was your Thanksgiving?

45:50.020 --> 45:52.460
I was like, oh, it was great. Oh, did you have turkey and all that?

45:53.020 --> 45:58.100
No, but thanks for making me want to cry again. Cool. Um, so that's that's not that guy

45:58.100 --> 46:04.180
Yeah, so no, no, no, it's cool. And that's why I tipped him $2, you know, it's cool, you know on a $9 bill

46:04.180 --> 46:09.540
So it's just totally fine. So um, so yeah, so like I took 10 minutes and I went outside and like okay

46:09.540 --> 46:13.420
I'm gonna call my parents and so we had like this. I don't know. I'm

46:13.700 --> 46:20.820
10 minutes probably over playing it probably six and a half minute conversation where I kind of realized that apparently my sister's not talking to me

46:20.900 --> 46:22.900
but I don't know why

46:23.380 --> 46:25.220
and um, I

46:25.220 --> 46:28.060
Found out because I wanted to compliment her on her hairstyle

46:30.860 --> 46:35.660
Who knows she's not coming to the phone. So um, we're like we're like cousins you and me

46:40.160 --> 46:45.760
So then it was like just this awkward like I want to say like 45 seconds where we just all sat on the phone

46:46.140 --> 46:48.140
No one's saying

46:48.340 --> 46:50.100
And it's like

46:50.100 --> 46:52.100
Okay, well, I

46:52.100 --> 46:56.540
Love you. Yeah, and I like and so then I come back in and I'm like, okay

46:56.540 --> 46:58.340
It's cool. It's cool. You're having a good day

46:58.340 --> 47:02.940
You're with people like you're finally like get into a point in LA where you have friends. That's cool

47:03.180 --> 47:09.820
Like don't it's okay. So then I like post something on Facebook to feel like I'm part of culture and

47:13.300 --> 47:15.300
Okay, it's the only

47:16.380 --> 47:19.660
Everyone else is saying something great about Thanksgiving. So I'm gonna be like hey

47:19.660 --> 47:23.340
I'm really grateful. This is my best LA Thanksgiving yet

47:23.340 --> 47:28.860
I got to hang out at meltdown comics and you know, watch awesome movies and blood just like bullshit bullshit bullshit

47:30.740 --> 47:35.420
Like some likes or whatever my dad responds with a frowny face

47:38.820 --> 47:40.820
Sorry Gage and Robert

47:40.820 --> 47:42.820
Yeah, we have a winner

47:43.100 --> 47:45.700
This is our new Thanksgiving tradition Heather gets

47:45.700 --> 47:47.700
20

47:50.700 --> 47:52.700
40

47:52.700 --> 47:54.700

Yeah, she also gets a DVD of Inglorious Bastards starting Brad Pitt, you know what here's my shirt take my shirt

48:22.380 --> 48:24.380
Fuck you Robert

48:25.580 --> 48:27.580
Gage you're all right

48:28.220 --> 48:30.760
Robert listen to Gage's story and then came up with that

48:30.760 --> 48:33.800
I was an ungrateful Thanksgiving guest

48:35.400 --> 48:41.720
All right, well everybody else like had I mean your your Thanksgiving sounded I couldn't even tell you the worst part of mine

48:41.720 --> 48:43.720
Because I gave you my real name

48:44.880 --> 48:48.760
Sadness meter had to come back down for Thanksgiving. I don't know

48:48.960 --> 48:52.560
Gage, we've got what do we miss? What was the worst part?

48:52.560 --> 48:57.320
I know you can't now you can't say because you gave us a real name, but give us like can you well

48:57.320 --> 49:03.880
Yeah, I'll circle around what you're talking about. Well, she doesn't she doesn't listen to this show. This is the girlfriend

49:03.880 --> 49:08.480
Yeah, it's a raccoon raccoon lady. Yeah, okay the raccoon lady

49:08.480 --> 49:12.600
I love so much. Let's all make an agreement that we won't Chevy chase this everyone's gonna fucking keep it

49:12.600 --> 49:17.120
We're gonna keep it to ourselves. We're never gonna tell raccoon lady that this happened

49:17.120 --> 49:19.960
I got a call last night that she's pregnant

49:19.960 --> 49:31.720
We don't really know what we're gonna do yet Heather just gave I

49:33.160 --> 49:35.160
Split it money

49:36.040 --> 49:38.040
How much did she give you?

49:39.960 --> 49:41.960
$40

49:42.760 --> 49:44.760
Going to college

49:44.760 --> 49:52.160
All right, raccoon college. Let's let's send Gage and Robert down and keep Heather up here cuz there's a

49:54.520 --> 49:57.400
You guys aren't bad people thank you Gage and Robert

49:58.120 --> 50:00.120
God knows Gage has a

50:00.960 --> 50:02.960
Mountains ahead to climb but

50:03.240 --> 50:07.120
You know, I don't want to play favorites, but I mean

50:08.040 --> 50:10.040
There's a vibe here. I

50:10.040 --> 50:17.160
Appreciate it. You're like you're my brother from another mother. I thought that you really all day on Thursday. I was like

50:17.880 --> 50:22.120
If you just can make it to Sunday, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine

50:22.280 --> 50:28.040
Really, I I'm a part of you keeping you going. Oh, you have no idea. Oh, yeah. Well, I mean this

50:29.120 --> 50:31.120
It scares me though

50:31.880 --> 50:35.800
On your shoulders because I know how fucking much that sucks, right?

50:35.800 --> 50:41.800
That's the thing is you know how you would receive that if I said that to you. So then that makes me know that you're yeah

50:41.800 --> 50:43.800
That's that it makes it fine. Yeah. Yeah

50:44.600 --> 50:45.960
What's nice?

50:45.960 --> 50:48.480
What do you what do you what do you what are you into?

50:53.880 --> 50:55.880
You like diehard

50:58.200 --> 51:01.700
You know like I'm into comedy and I like cartoons and

51:01.700 --> 51:03.700
I

51:04.180 --> 51:07.060
Drawing and stuff and I do you're an artist

51:08.220 --> 51:11.420
I'm trying to get better at saying yes to that question

51:12.340 --> 51:18.460
Because it's like I grew up in a geography and a time where that wasn't a real thing that you went out and did

51:19.100 --> 51:23.420
And I'm not professionally an artist like I don't make money as an artist

51:25.220 --> 51:26.980
No, I

51:26.980 --> 51:34.700
Mean once upon a time. Yeah, like oh, I like in a dream world. Yes, but um, I mean realistically at this stage in my life like

51:35.380 --> 51:37.380
I'm paying my bills and I

51:37.700 --> 51:39.700
I'm making it as like

51:40.300 --> 51:45.820
Are you do you think you're kind of good at drawing? I'm kind of good at drawing. Yeah, what do you like to draw?

51:45.820 --> 51:49.940
When you like you like you doodle when you're like on the phone and stuff or I would you doodle like

51:50.460 --> 51:54.780
Like compulsively like some people do I'm not compulsive like some people

51:54.780 --> 52:01.820
And I know what you're talking about like like that kind of like I'm jealous of those people who like like need to be drawing

52:01.820 --> 52:03.820
Yeah, that's one of the reasons why

52:09.060 --> 52:10.660
But

52:10.660 --> 52:15.460
That's one of the reasons why I thought maybe I'm not an artist because I had somebody say that to me once like well

52:15.460 --> 52:17.820
If you can if you can just get through the day and you don't have to draw

52:17.820 --> 52:22.300
Yeah, fuck that shit. No, that's that's that's a horrible thing to say. Okay. Maybe I'm not an artist

52:22.300 --> 52:25.420
But like, you know, you have a Mickey Mouse in your shirt like a lot of our friends are

52:25.820 --> 52:29.100
Drawy types and I don't think that they would ever walk on the street and say hi

52:29.100 --> 52:32.660
I'm an artist some might and some might not but I think a lot of our friends like

52:34.020 --> 52:36.020
Whether they be

52:36.060 --> 52:41.260
Animators or actors or musicians or whatever would would be very bashful about saying that they're artists

52:41.260 --> 52:45.700
I talked to this guy. I talked to a photographer over the weekend who I met

52:45.700 --> 52:48.740
It was a very interesting conversation because I'm not a visual person at all

52:48.740 --> 52:52.900
I was like I was always I'm always interested to talk to like artists and photographers and stuff

52:54.620 --> 53:00.060
The and he was talking late into the night as the as the booze hit and the

53:00.900 --> 53:04.300
You know things got headier and deeper and sadder

53:05.300 --> 53:10.420
He started talking about how, you know, there's all these things he wants to do with his photography, but like

53:11.460 --> 53:16.900
Every like every once in a while. He's like, oh my god. I'm the worst fucking hack in the world. I suck

53:16.900 --> 53:21.100
I'm the worst. I'm like a joke. It's it's incredible that I ever took myself seriously

53:21.100 --> 53:27.140
I'm a fucking nuisance on society and then and then the next day. He'll be like, oh wow

53:27.140 --> 53:32.660
I'm I'm actually really good. I'm great and and and I was like, you know

53:32.660 --> 53:40.060
That's like a piston going up and down like you don't want to be somebody who's just like even keeled about what they do

53:40.060 --> 53:42.060
If you're a creative like you want to be

53:42.060 --> 53:46.940
Frankly bipolar like you like like whatever no offense to bipolar people

53:46.940 --> 53:51.780
But I mean like you want to be literally have two poles because that's what an engine has it good

53:51.780 --> 53:58.100
It's exploding one minute, and then it's not exploding the next minute. It's like and that's why the car goes vroom vroom, you know

53:59.740 --> 54:01.740
I ended up talking to

54:02.500 --> 54:04.500
It's one of my friends. She's my ex

54:05.340 --> 54:10.900
Who I realized this week maybe that's the function of an ex is like because I've heard you tell stories about how your

54:10.900 --> 54:13.940
Friends with some of your exes or that you at least all of them

54:13.940 --> 54:21.180
Yeah, like I'm starting to realize like what a wonderful thing that is in your life because these are people that know you so well and

54:21.340 --> 54:22.940
Can say

54:22.940 --> 54:27.940
Anything to you now because you don't have anything left to lose. Yeah, and so I don't know

54:27.940 --> 54:29.860
I was just kind of telling her about my shitty

54:30.420 --> 54:33.500
Emotional reaction of Thanksgiving and her point was a

54:34.220 --> 54:39.940
When have they said that they're proud of you ever like why do you keep expecting to hear that?

54:39.940 --> 54:41.940
Because that's never something that's happened

54:42.820 --> 54:45.180
You know it's just not good like they love you

54:45.180 --> 54:52.420
But it's just they're never gonna say it in the words that you want to hear and then be would you be the ambitious creative person?

54:52.420 --> 54:54.420
You are if they had

54:55.100 --> 55:01.780
Manifest this love in the way that you want it to be manifest right and I was a conditional love pretty good pretty good for creative people

55:01.780 --> 55:03.780
I think

55:05.260 --> 55:07.220
I mean, I don't want to I don't want to you know

55:07.220 --> 55:12.700
I'm sure there's there I also meet a lot of people that seem really talented and they're like, oh, I love my parents

55:20.940 --> 55:26.140
We're given a camera wise could you just move down closer to death so we can get you guys on a sexy two-shot

55:28.780 --> 55:34.220
All right, so right well, okay, there's two things we can do we'll do them in this order

55:34.220 --> 55:41.860
So do you want to try an exercise that my therapist did with me once sure, okay?

55:41.860 --> 55:46.060
It might make you cry though. All right, okay, but I'm probably not that good

55:47.060 --> 55:50.940
She spent years of training, but I'm good at crying. So all right, so

55:52.020 --> 55:53.700
Okay, so

55:53.700 --> 55:55.700
So imagine yourself

55:55.940 --> 56:00.060
Maybe it might help if you close your eyes. She should we all be doing this or just just well

56:00.060 --> 56:04.220
No, you can just participate. I guess but if you all talk at the same time, that'll be weird

56:06.300 --> 56:10.020
You know like when Tom Cruise has to hold his breath for three minutes y'all kind of hold your breath

56:10.020 --> 56:14.180
Yeah, it's like like then halfway through it. You're like, okay, and then you just watch the rest of the movie

56:18.220 --> 56:23.140
The the I never even I hold I always hope my breath like what or before the guy goes into the water

56:23.180 --> 56:29.220
Because I was like and I still can't even make that gap because it's like you got three minutes to diffuse that underwater bomb

56:29.220 --> 56:31.220
And I'm like, and then he's like

56:32.260 --> 56:34.660
He's not done saying like wish me luck and I'm like

56:38.860 --> 56:44.740
I've never I've never done I've never tried I always do that really if you show me a movie where a guy has to hold his breath

56:45.100 --> 56:47.100
applause people do that Wow

56:47.700 --> 56:50.420
Because I always want to just measure like when I'd be dead

56:51.340 --> 56:54.540
If in a movie someone said okay, you have to hold your breath for three minutes

56:54.540 --> 56:59.140
I would just go oh, I know I can't do that like I could maybe do a minute and I'd be bummed out

56:59.140 --> 57:01.420
And that's why I would just not they don't always say it

57:01.420 --> 57:05.860
They don't always call it out, but you can see that they're gonna go into water. They're like, oh, that's all under water

57:05.860 --> 57:08.160
I was gonna be underwater scene. So I'm like, okay

57:08.160 --> 57:11.820
I want to see if I could and I'm just sitting at a couch and the guy's going like that

57:11.820 --> 57:13.860
I can't even go like this without running out of breath

57:17.820 --> 57:22.900
So joke so it's all right. It's all right cry exercise. All right Thanksgiving

57:22.900 --> 57:32.700
Exercise, okay for all of you like fractured people close your eyes. Okay, you are you you're the adult you

57:33.220 --> 57:39.780
You are in the home that you were in when you were a child

57:40.340 --> 57:42.180
But you're adult you

57:42.180 --> 57:45.860
The home that your bedroom was in when you were let's say

57:46.500 --> 57:48.500
10 years old

57:48.980 --> 57:50.980
So picture that home

57:50.980 --> 57:52.980
You're in it

57:53.740 --> 57:55.060
somewhere

57:55.060 --> 57:56.340
living room

57:56.340 --> 57:57.500
kitchen

57:57.500 --> 57:59.500
Those are the two possibilities

58:00.900 --> 58:06.780
So somewhere in this home is the bedroom that you slept in when you were 10

58:08.140 --> 58:10.340
So now you're gonna walk

58:11.820 --> 58:15.700
Slowly to that door of that bedroom

58:15.700 --> 58:23.140
I say slowly so that you can really picture it like because you remember what the carpet looked like you remember the walls

58:23.740 --> 58:25.740
Little Chachke's whatever

58:27.100 --> 58:31.500
Now you get to the door and you're gonna open it and

58:33.100 --> 58:39.340
Your 10 year old self is sitting in their bedroom on the bed

58:40.780 --> 58:43.180
So picture who you were when you were 10

58:43.180 --> 58:45.460
You are who you are now

58:47.540 --> 58:49.540
Now

58:49.700 --> 58:56.660
You at home do this in your own head, but Heather will you describe that child physically?

58:59.740 --> 59:03.780
In a lot of ways, I guess it's what I'm trying to emulate now

59:06.340 --> 59:10.980
Small always been small for my age long brown hair bangs

59:10.980 --> 59:12.980
No glasses yet

59:13.820 --> 59:18.380
Not cuz I didn't need them just cuz I didn't have any health insurance and we didn't realize it

59:22.180 --> 59:24.180
Shared the room with my sister

59:26.100 --> 59:28.100
In a queen bed

59:29.300 --> 59:35.060
So 10 year old Heather's sitting there what might she typically be doing

59:37.580 --> 59:39.020
Drawing

59:39.020 --> 59:44.300
So she's drawing now you're gonna sit down on the bed a comfortable distance from her

59:45.100 --> 59:47.900
Your adult self look at your 10 year old self

59:50.460 --> 59:52.860
What what do you think of her?

59:54.780 --> 59:59.220
Like don't say what you think you're supposed to say like

59:59.220 --> 01:00:06.220
Judge her or or praise her. What do you really think of her? Oh?

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:30.860
I wish I could tell her that it doesn't you don't have to be so afraid that you're gonna spend the next 25 years being afraid and

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:37.540
And you don't have to but is she afraid now?

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.780
10 at 10. Yes

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.780
Yes

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.660
Absolutely scared shitless, so she's a fearful person

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.820
Maybe for good reasons

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:58.340
So alright, so now speak to her now now say like you judge you judge your appraiser or whatever

01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:02.020
You thought those things but now tell her what you think an adult should tell her

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.220
I'll be so confident believe yourself

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:13.020
This sounds like so much bullshit like what so many people say to like say to yourself, but absolutely the truth like

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:16.140
Trust your gut

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.620
Stop stop thinking that

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.620
That somebody else's approval matters

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:30.220
Great perfect Thanksgiving

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.340
All right now my second idea

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.980
Now I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do a Thanksgiving wrap and

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:50.420
And Heather you seem like a you seem like a smart person like what I'd like you to do is try to like

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:55.060
Like you know how Vincent Price like in thriller like he comes in and goes

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.580
scary spiders and

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.820
goblins

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:03.740
Like it's a Thanksgiving wrap, so like I want you to just come in you don't have to rhyme

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.580
Prefer if you didn't and just kind of like just

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:13.340
Uncork and just kind of like just just talk the way you do and your cadence just kind of like you have to say it

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.940
Like Vincent Price. No, no, no, no

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:19.660
No, I'd rather just be yourself and just kind of but just kind of like an amp maybe an amped up version of yourself for that

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:23.820
It's like I just kind of like babble for a little bit like it's like I'm pushing a Heather button

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:25.820
And you're just kind of like talking about

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:31.140
No, yeah, whenever I I'll like I'll cue you. I think like I'll wrap for a little bit

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.140
Things to look for as I'm probably gonna talk about fucking people's mamas and

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.540
It's a good chance. I'm gonna rhyme the words south and mouth

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:47.180
I'm gonna try not to because I like to try always trying to stretch myself but

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.140
But but but but then after a couple verses

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:56.580
I'll I kind of then if I if I'm faltering like if I stop or point at you or whatever and then just like just just like do

01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:05.140
Like a little just a little rambly monologue if it could be free association or just like anything a story or just random words or

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:08.060
Doesn't absolutely doesn't matter just free flow

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:15.880
Thanksgiving anxiety, but not even Thanksgiving like it does it. I mean like family anxiety. All right. Okay. All right, so

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.240
All right, you ready? Yeah

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:30.400
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.480
I

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.460
Sorry, I'm limited on my beats tonight. I'm gonna try a different be here. Okay. Yeah, I think that beat was bad

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:01.680
Yeah, yeah, that's more by anxiety right there. Really? Okay. You know, okay? Well, it's kind of

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.680
I

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:14.840
Kind of like the first one I thought oh, oh, oh, oh wait this one. I think this one's gonna be good. Okay. Yo

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:22.040
All right, give me some more in the come on can't hear it come on

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.120
Oh Steve Levyme come out be a hype man Steve Levyme hype man

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:34.920
You know how to do it now, right, but leave me you're gonna start it off. You're gonna hype it up

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.980
Just got off the rep. All right, everybody give it up for

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.600
Why why should they because he's the fucking best

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Seems perfunctual like

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.640
Like like give specific

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.120
Like why am I the best?

01:04:53.120 --> 01:05:00.160
Talk about how his beats flow or his rhymes compare me to other emcees or or yeah

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
he's like Eminem meets I

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.120
Don't know rappers clearly

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.400
Okay, he's like Jerry Garcia meets

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.800
MC Hammer

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.880
Okay, that's actually pretty pretty apt. All right

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:25.280
All right world's best hype man Steve Levyme. Oh good. Oh, and now keep hyping later, too

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.320
But yeah, but don't step on Heather how to become this person

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.400
Turkey

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.040
mashed potatoes

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.720
Fuck your mama so hard to it. Okay

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:43.480
All right, just give me a service happen. It's only just getting warmed up people. That's good. That's good

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:48.600
Okay, now it's just a little bit just kill a little more

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:57.480
Fucking late on them. Come on. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Why should I deserve it because they're loyal fans. All right

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.920
Let's go turkeys only have two legs

Thanks. Give me some time. You don't have to beg. Yeah, I can't hear the beat. Come on. Come on. All right. Yeah

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:19.600
T to the H to the A-N-K I fucked your mama so hard down the special day

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.280
commemorating pilgrims and genocide

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.520
Mama so hard litter pussy got wide don't step on the rhymes ever

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.920
That was a good one

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.060
That's the opposite of hype to step on the

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.560
Part of it. All right, just okay

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.960
Indians don't column Indians

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.120
Native Americans

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:54.800
Fighting the pilgrims then they said hey, we're nice and the pilgrims said

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Put you on ice with

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
the smallpox

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.640
Get out of this barrel Harmon

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.680
Okay, go ahead ladies and gentlemen

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.560
Nino

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.720
Maria

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.960
Mayflower. I didn't see you

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.600
Fuck your mama. Fuck your dad

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:30.240
I went to Salem when the ride was bad and drew plastic acid on it. They saw witches are coming with all my turkey bitches

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:35.520
Got a east coast because the coast is the most especially when there's no other coast yet

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:47.600
So thanksgiving is great and thanksgiving is fine and sometimes you think I just want someone to like me a little

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:51.240
And maybe I would like it if I heard my mom say hey, I'm proud

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:57.160
But then I think well at least I didn't go to some thanksgiving where my mom is trying to fuck some stranger

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.520
Cuz that would make me feel kind of awkward and maybe like I wouldn't want to go home as much either

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:06.440
So I guess it's good that we can just say hey and call each other once in a while

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:18.440
And you know, I'll like call again on Christmas

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.920
I think it's the hype whomever he pleases and we bring it back

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:27.920
Oh, man, let's go

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.520
mashed potatoes

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:40.920
Yo take the ferry from Staten Island to Manhattan

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.340
Mama so hard 9-eleven. Okay. Oh

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.800
Shit, it's actually 9-eleven. Yeah, well, that's not that's not

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:54.640
God damn it. I didn't get any good rhymes in

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.800
All right, fine, you know, it's we'll try it we'll try it later. All right, thank you

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.360
I thought Heather really broke it down there. Yeah, let's have a hand for Heather

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:17.840
All right, no take the shirt. I mean, I'm not assuming you want it, but be weird to bail on that

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.920
So she got eighty one dollars forty of what she gave away to gauge

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.000
Yeah, you're right

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.800
And then she got a shirt and a DVD of Inglorious bastards. Yeah, that's a fucking big haul

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:35.320
And I gave her the shirt off my back literally and and Robert was like yeah

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:38.640
I went to some people's house and like I wasn't very grateful and

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.400
Then gauge was like what am I gonna do? I can't be a dad

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:52.200
It's like we kind of hit all the fucking mountains and valleys of this season like I

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.280
Now Steve

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:01.320
How clear or unclear I hear the concept of

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:07.360
I don't know idea did you ever listen to

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:14.080
Bears by last week that I didn't even what about public enemy. Are you familiar with them? I know flavor Flav

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:21.200
Yeah, he had a clock. I've seen it and then he'd say people he go what time it is right and he'd say Joe Chuck

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:26.520
Tell people things because they haven't heard it yet, and then Chuck would be like sometimes you'd be like

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.520
I don't know if I can

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:35.000
I don't think I don't think they're ready for you Chuck. Yeah, are they ready? Are you ready? Like he would like get the crowd

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.880
Yeah for the science that may or may not be drunk

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:44.480
And you know why that's important for black men in the 90s. Tell me

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.760
Then still mad about you hyping Heather

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.280
Well, that's weird to hype. That's like hyping Vincent Price

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.880
It's it's

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:04.920
That's weird. He doesn't have a hype valve. She was the she was the Rihanna. Like you don't hype Rihanna Rihanna is fine

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:12.160
Hype hype Eminem she was a guest. I thought you know she did fine. She doesn't need hyping

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.880
Don't give don't give hype notes. He was hyping people. I've got to give him hype notes

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:20.480
You were just you just started the hype note session. I was just asking what you know, he's you know, he's you know

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.480
He's right. I would say like

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:30.960
Uh, does the Steve Levy know about hype manning? No, but but do we how much do we want to change Steve Levy's version of hyping?

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.960
Well, not not like 20%

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:38.160
Like I still want it to be kind of like I still want you to go. Yeah

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:43.920
Put your hands together. He didn't even do that. He just said like it's Dan Harmon. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.800
It's great. Ah Steve. Ah Steve

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:52.360
Steve you Steve how is your your connection with your family over the holidays?

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.360
Are you close family?

01:11:54.680 --> 01:12:01.800
Yeah, I I didn't obviously didn't go home. But but are you are you a big family small family?

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:07.040
I have a relatively large family. Yeah, are you are you close with them? Oh, yeah. Yeah

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.640
My family is pretty tight knit. You guys get along. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no black sheep

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:18.120
No, and you hit like everybody hates or no, no not at all. Do you have a very well balanced like awesome thing?

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.760
Yeah, we do. It's kind of it's strange. I guess people like

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.600
The circles I roll and it's like I'm like a monster. Yeah

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:32.520
Yeah, I uh, that's sorry. I always felt like yeah, you're like a monster. I know

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.600
There's a deficit in my in my I have no ambition and I don't think I'm as creative as my as my friends

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:44.280
Uh, who didn't like their parents. I like my family like I think that that that's uh, that's a real, uh

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:47.320
Way to have a terrible career and entertainment

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.600
Yeah, I I love my family. I do and uh, I

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.720
I don't know I texted with them. I called them

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.400
I heard I heard from them wish them happy. That's why it's why you're not a

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:07.480
A born hype man because that's arbitrary. Like you were born with hype built into your right. You are you you you came pre-hyped

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:13.400
Came out of the womb with hype in you and your mom hyped you and

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:19.080
You like you're everyone's hyped around you people are generally hyped by you

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:24.600
Without you having to hype them. Yeah, like I get hyped just be just to see your smile every morning

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.640
That's what I said

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.400
Thank you. Yeah

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:33.080
I remember when you got that mouth surgery. Yeah, I was like I almost killed myself

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:38.840
Because you were acting the way I would act if I were you which is to be like, okay, so here's the third

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.080
You have a really busy day tomorrow

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.760
I need I need the seething joy

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.880
So I can blot it out. Well, you got it

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:56.440
Brain really tomorrow morning. I'll be I'll be right there smiling making sure everything gets done right

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.240
So he's a natural mellow

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.280
You know water and ninja hype man like he

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.320
Steve fills the lowest places

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.760
Done like all day. He's hyping all day flavor flays probably a piece of shit most of the day

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:14.360
And then he's like compensating when he gets out and stays with chuck

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:21.400
He probably probably right before public enemy went on. I'm sure I'm sure flavor flavor is probably like yo chuck use a coaster, man

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.800
Right, and chuck and chuck's like what why do I have to use a coaster?

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:32.200
It's my bad. Yo, man. You think you try going out there without the guy with a clock around his neck, man

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.760
Use a fucking coaster when you're in my trailer

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:41.800
Oh, it's fine, but you kind of fucking you fucking me up, man. I'm about to go on stage. Oh, I'll make it up to you

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:48.520
And then they go out and everyone's like whoo, and he's like yo chuck and it's like he's like chuck chuck tea is like like

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:55.240
Uh, like what was it someone's like yell out. You said stop it. Yeah, you have to

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.920
We should just explore this. Yes. Wait

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:05.240
He has to stop talking about the public enemy. I think he has to stop performing as is my read

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:08.040
Is it what is it? What is your angle madam?

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.920
Are you on like mescaline, what's happening

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.920
Yeah, she's she's

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:23.400
She's having a I are you the world's biggest public enemy fan or

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:35.160
Okay, you know, it's a Minecraft fan. All right, she's she's I like look, oh, she's in a different plane. Yeah, I know like well

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.400
Look, she's we have a policy here at Harmontown. We don't like when the audience is drunker than we are

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:47.640
That's our only requisite is that you guys be slightly less drunk than we are. Yeah, she won't she won't remember this

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.960
But yeah, kind of interrupted my flow. I was in the middle of a scene

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:57.880
That I was excited about it was like like giving a new voice to these classic characters and

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:01.320
Then flavor play, you know the rest of it flavor plate goes out and he like, you know

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:04.840
He really hypes him up and then chuck is like I can't stay mad at you

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.520
Thanks. How low can you go death row?

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.520
Dan you really have to stop

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.600
I'm not sure what you have to stop but whatever forward momentum is really my enemy

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:29.240
And she was I had a box of wine earlier and I would like you to stop whatever you're all of your instincts

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.960
Whatever you're thinking right now do something other than that

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:35.080
She was talking to the walls

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.040
I want to get off

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.040
I'm not going to take it personally

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:48.600
Uh, if only gay just parents were here to just gently fondle her

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.840
Or if we had a cage full of raccoons outside she could go

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:03.960
Oh, all right. All right, let's get back on track for god's sake. We had a big show tonight. We're a shit

Rock, paper, scissors.

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:37.240

Okay, all right.

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:13.240
Okay, honey, start the boat.

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:19.240
Earth, wind, fire, sticks, dicks,

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:26.240

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.240
She didn't say thank you.

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.240
She's ungrateful.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:38.240
So today is all about being grateful every day.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.240
It's a mnemonic device,

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:43.240
because your mama didn't thank me.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:45.240
I fucked her twice.

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.240
She came in on a boat,

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.240
and I gave her a little bit of stuff.

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.240
I'm trying to...

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.240
Sorry, it's...

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:56.240
I'm not trying to be offensive.

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.240
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.240
Okay, just give me one second, please.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.240
Keep touching me.

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:02.240
Well, you touched me a lot.

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.240
I did?

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:04.240
Yeah, you know, you're very touchy.

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.240
When was I touching you?

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.240
Every five seconds when you met me.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.240
You wouldn't pass the potatoes.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.240
No, when you came in the door, pans everywhere.

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:12.240
What?

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.240
No, it was notable.

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:15.240
Oh, by the way, I brought you some blankets.

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.240
Yeah, I know.

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.240
Everything's, I'm getting sick.

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.240
I know that.

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:19.240
I know I'm getting sick.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:25.240
I'll tell you what's not sick, your beats and your rhymes.

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:27.240
All right, that's going to steam me up.

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.240
That's steaming me up.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.240
Oh, you uncorked the revenge

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:33.240
of this Native American engine,

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:37.240
and I'm going to wrap your heart out.

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.240
I'm going to eat your mama's pussy

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.240
and then fart it out.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.240
I'm going to eat it like it was beans,

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.240
and then I'm going to race down the coast.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.240
Know what you mean.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.240
I'm going to get up on a hill overlooking.

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:51.240
Fuck your mama so hard, I said.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240
Smells like something's cooking.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.240
It was friction from my penis and her pussy.

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.240
Nothing rhymes with pussy ever,

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.240
ever, ever rhymes with pussy.

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.240
Thanksgiving, y'all.

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.240
Thanksgiving, y'all.

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.240
Thanksgiving, y'all.

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:13.240
Thanksgiving, y'all.

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.240
Thanksgiving, y'all.

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.240
Thanksgiving, y'all.

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:19.240
Who gets the times when there's nothing being given, y'all?

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.240
Homeless people in the street begging for food.

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.240
The glad cops start shooting you in the mood.

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:28.240
Nobody's going to get anybody nothing.

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:31.240
I fucked your mama so hard, she turned into a muffin.

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:34.240
Oh, that sweet vagina.

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.240
This never been findered.

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.240
God, it's just how terrible it would wrap it today.

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.240
Not that I've ever been good,

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.240
but it's exceptional this week.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:53.240
But that's fine. Thanksgiving is a special time when you go to people that you love and you say thank you.

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:56.240
Thank you. I hate myself.

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:59.240
You're ripped.

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:06.240
Genocide. I don't know what is my supposed to do there. I don't know what to do.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:07.240
Native rap.

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:12.240
Alright. Brandon Beatington. Is it Brandon?

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.240
Oh, thank you.

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:16.240
Brad Beatington.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:20.240
Brad Beatington. Thank you so much, sir. Welcome back.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.240
That's the story of the first Thanksgiving.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:27.240
Yeah, I guess. Alright. Can we please get to the real show?

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.240
Let's just...

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.240
Yeah.

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.240
Okay. Thank you, sir. It was very nice. Nice shirt.

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.240
Thank you for your service, man.

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:36.240
Alright. Come on. Let's get serious.

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.240
Alright.

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.240
So some people are going to be walking out there with some buckets right now.

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:48.240
And, you know, leukemia is bad.

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.240
That whole thing was really where I think Spencer was cracking up.

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:57.240
Oh, I loved it. I loved when Jeff started beeping and booping and you were really getting intense.

01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:59.240
That was the best.

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.240
Fuck, man.

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:02.240
What did you do for Thanksgiving, Spencer?

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:10.240
Oh, man. I just... No, I went to Dino's thing. He had his family over and then a bunch of people from Starburn's.

01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:16.240
Very not funny. A kid fell in a cactus. That's kind of funny, I guess.

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.240
Yeah, that was sad.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.240
Well, I thought that was funny.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:23.240
Which kid was it? I was kid?

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:29.240
No, it was Io's tenance three-year-old daughter.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:30.240
That sounds right.

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.240
That's not funny. If it was Io's kid, that's kind of funny.

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:36.240
Because that kid's kind of a terror.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.240
That's what Dino was saying.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:41.240
He was being so mean. I was like, oh, he's a good kid.

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:43.240
I mean, he's a resilient kid. He can handle it.

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:44.240
Dino's kicking him.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:49.240
Yeah. Well, believe me, nothing's going to stop him from serial killing, so it doesn't...

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:53.240
And the kid's like absolutely destined to be a serial killer.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:56.240
Spencer, did you communicate with your family at all, your mom and dad?

01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:01.240
My mom texted me. She's like, happy Thanksgiving. I'm so thankful for you.

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:06.240
And then two days later, I was like, oh, yeah, I really miss your stuffing.

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:11.240
And then she was like, oh, you know, we're having dinner right now. You could come right over.

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:18.240
And then two days later, I was like, that would have been good.

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:21.240
How often have you been back to your parents' house at all?

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:25.240
My parents' house is no longer like they sold it off.

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:30.240
And my dad moved to Columbia and my mom's couch surfing across America or something.

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.240
Columbia?

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.240
Yeah.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.240
Catch up, man.

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.240
No, it's fine.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:38.240
I did not know that your dad fucked off to a...

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:44.240
Yeah, he fucked off there. He's teaching animation. He's not an animator.

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:48.240
So he's not really a teacher.

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:53.240
I think he now speaks Spanish, which I hope they speak over there.

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.240
I believe they do.

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.240
Okay, good. Bass is covered.

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.240
But yeah, no, it's just really weird.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:04.240
It's weird that he now teaches animation in Columbia.

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:08.240
So he's like, first day of class, everybody draw a picture.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.240
All right, go home.

01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:16.240
And then they come back and he's like, okay, now draw the same picture, but a little different.

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:20.240
And he's like, why isn't this different? You get enough.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:22.240
Why is this too different?

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:26.240
And then they slowly learn how to animate.

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.240
It's probably that hard to teach, really.

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.240
Yeah, I mean, it's probably not hard to teach a lot of disciplines.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.240
Yeah, like name a discipline.

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.240
I heard karate.

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.240
CPR.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:41.240
Yeah, just push on their chest until it makes their heart beat more.

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.240
Or karate until it stops beating.

01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:48.240
Yeah.

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:52.240
Yeah, you can teach karate and CPR and CPR.

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:58.240
You can just give people a degree in one and then go now flip it.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:02.240
You have a special school, Spencer's School of CPR and Karate.

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:07.240
And your degree is like a playing card, like where you turn it upside down.

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:09.240
And it's like...

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:12.240
The problem is reversible.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:18.240
Uh, what?

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:20.240
I bet you...

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.240
Oh, sex ed, yeah, we'll put your winner in the...

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.240
Anybody does teach that.

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.240
Not a joke.

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.240
Too many people teach in that.

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.240
Kids having kids, am I right, Gage?

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.240
Whoa!

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.240
What?

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:40.240
Jesus, he knows!

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:42.240
I'm sorry, that was insensitive.

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.240
I apologize, Gage.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.240
I acknowledge my crime.

01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:51.240
I express remorse and I commit to change.

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:55.240
That's what they taught me how to do in Apple.

01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:58.240
That's like literally in the employee training.

01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.240
That's a real apology.

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:00.240
Like the three ingredients.

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:03.240
But you can't really just say them like I said.

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:09.240
Also, I think it diminishes it to look at your fingers and count them up.

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:14.240
What else should I apologize for?

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.240
I'm sorry I yelled at that kid on Twitter.

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:17.240
What kid?

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:18.240
What that kid?

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:20.240
Whatever that kid, I yelled at that kid on Twitter.

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.240
Back like months ago?

01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:23.240
Yeah, last time we were in New York.

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.240
Hey kid, I'm sorry.

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.240
I yelled at you on Twitter.

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.240
I feel bad.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.240
I won't yell at you on Twitter again.

01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.240
Because your account's private now.

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:38.240
Yeah.

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.240
I've been yelling at Gamergate all weekend on Twitter.

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:47.240
I caught a tiny bit of that and I tried to look back and find the origin and it was too much work.

01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:48.240
So what the hell's going on?

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:50.240
You know that Graham Linehan.

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:51.240
He's a great man.

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.240
Great man, that Graham Linehan.

01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:56.240
He posted something and talked about.

01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:01.240
It was like a news article and talked about how he says that remote radicalization is a serious thing

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.240
and it could happen in Gamergate and I was like,

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.240
Gamergate, those idiots.

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.240
And you know, the floodgates opened.

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:08.240
Oh man.

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:13.240
So just the past 48 hours have just been telling people to kill themselves

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:16.240
and then blocking those people.

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:18.240
I saw some guys like,

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:20.240
I don't know if you guys like Harmonjam, it's Spencer Crittenden.

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.240
I know to Dan Harmon they tweeted that.

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:25.240
It's like, were you here two weeks ago?

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.240
What do you think is going to happen?

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:32.240
People were telling on you to me.

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:37.240
The reason I know about it is my name was added on to that thing.

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:40.240
It's like, hey, Jeff Davis, Erin McGathy, Dan Harmon.

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.240
Yeah, Erin McGathy's here.

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.240
Yeah, Spencer Crittenden really wants everyone to kill themselves.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:50.240
Click here if you want to see all the rich tapestry of all the time as Spencer.

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:54.240
They added in a mosaic that formed my face when you zoomed it out.

01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:04.240
It's like Mad Magazine's 50th anniversary cover.

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:08.240
Yeah, well, yeah.

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:14.240
Okay, so yeah, if you're 16, talk to somebody.

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.240
Unless you're in Gamergate.

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:18.240
Unless you're in Gamergate, unless you're a Gamergator, then yeah, kill yourself.

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.240
You've forfeited your life anyway, yeah.

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:20.240
I mean, I would say.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.240
Please, and I know that I'm the only person in the room that has no idea what that is.

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:27.240
Gamergate means that there was a time when a woman said something and all the gamer games told her.

01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:30.240
Yeah, I mean, it would take us five minutes of going through it and even just in going.

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:31.240
It's one of those issues where they're going.

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:33.240
Well, I think I can build off his thing in 30 seconds.

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:36.240
What you just said happened.

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:39.240
And then from then on, everyone's like, no, it didn't.

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:42.240
And then, you know, some people are like, well, yeah, that's that's history.

01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.240
And then they are like, no, you're wrong.

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.240
And now I'm going to bother you for two days straight because we don't believe in recording history.

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:56.240
When we retell history, we talk about stories and we talk about people as if there's like these events that happen.

01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.240
Like, oh, Archbishop Ferdinand got assassinated in that.

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.240
But it's like, no.

01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.240
Archduke.

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.240
Whatever.

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:05.240
Don't rewrite history.

01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:09.240
He was effectively defrocked that day.

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:13.240
But it's like, we only do that because we have to have something to talk about.

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:22.240
But the scary thing is that's the scary thing about the Trump thing, because if it's like, honestly, like, it's not a joke anymore to say, like, he's Hitler.

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:25.240
Like, and that he's exactly like Hitler and that he's Hitler.

01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:28.240
It's not a joke because like Hitler had a funny haircut and everyone was kept.

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:34.240
And he was a reality television star, basically, because he wrote Mein Kampf and was like, oh, look at me.

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.240
Everybody look at me.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:38.240
And he wasn't a genius and he wasn't like an idealist at all.

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:47.240
He wasn't like a person that was like, I think we should all do this or he was just a guy that was like mad and dumb and was in the like, like, like, like he served a purpose.

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:56.240
And like this, these like the weird thing about that gamer gate thing is it's like what you because you keep asking yourself like, well, why would you if you ever were getting involved in this?

01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:00.240
Why would you even still be arguing about all this stuff?

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:04.240
And the answer is because it's never about like these events or these people.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:07.240
It's always about like these weird like shifts, like these biomasses.

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:11.240
They just build up frustration and shame and rage.

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.240
And then they flow this way or that way.

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:21.240
And there's like these magmatic like like eruptions and everybody that's that is like beating people at Donald Trump rallies and being into it.

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:24.240
They take they know like they're not there.

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.240
They know he's an idiot like and they're into it like they're like, oh, good.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.240
He's going to say it.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:36.240
So like I can now I can hit this guy with a pole and then Donald Trump's like like that guy hit a guy with a pole because I'm very popular.

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:40.240
And he's like an idiot like he doesn't he doesn't know what he's doing.

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:48.240
Like that's the scary thing is like he the humanities like evil like it gathers in these clouds and it's just like and it's because of hero worship.

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:56.240
It's because we think that individuals are like important and that oh, you said that you should be the way we're going to cut this guy's head off.

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.240
And if we cut that guy's head off, then nothing bad will happen anymore.

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:03.240
And thinking that is what allows for like these clouds of evil to spread.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:07.240
And like like like that's what's happening right now or like living in history.

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.240
Like there's a fucking fascist running for president and he doesn't make him cool at all.

01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:14.240
It doesn't even make him cool in like a fucking bad guy way.

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.240
He's just a fucking clown.

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:25.240
But he's like there's so many angry fucking people that are like they're just like and they're not even like can you imagine like after World War One how they were using like wads of money for door stops and toilet paper.

01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.240
Like that's how fucking scared they were.

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:35.240
We're just like oh I have to golf nine holes instead of 18 like and there's fucking hitting Hispanic people at rallies.

01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:42.240
And then they're saying to him like hey what about that guy that got beaten at your rally and he's like well my fans are passionate.

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:49.240
Like it's fucking and his hair is everywhere and everyone's like hardy har har like fucking like he's Hitler.

01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:55.240
He's Hitler which is not it doesn't make him important doesn't make him strong doesn't make him scary even.

01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:57.240
It makes the fucking situation scary.

01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:58.240
He's Hitler.

01:40:58.240 --> 01:40:59.240
We're scary.

01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:01.240
Like we're doing fucked up scary shit.

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:09.240
Gamergate is fucking another one of those things because those guys those guys got in a van and like went and shot up that like.

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:11.240
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:12.240
Those are like 4chan.

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:19.240
There was like a guy from 4chan that 4chan doesn't even like that was like went and shot the black lives matter.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:24.240
They were like oh I don't know if they were related to the agitators at the Minnesota protests.

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.240
There was like video.

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.240
I don't know.

01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.240
It's somehow related in there.

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:34.240
I'm not I'm not the last thing I'm going to do is go like yeah 4chan anything because it's fucking credit cards shut off tomorrow.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:46.240
But the the the but because that guy was like some knob who was like there was like a guy in the video who was like oh I'm going to go do this like that.

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:49.240
I'm going to go troll the like black lives matter.

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:53.240
And then guns at him getting fired and five people got shot.

01:41:53.240 --> 01:42:08.240
Anyways but it but my point being friend friend yes fringe groups radical groups dumb dumb ass fascist like politicians like what's happening right now is just as as gradual and dangerous as the weather.

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:19.240
Or as like a super volcano under Yellowstone it's not it has nothing to do with like oh no how if this election goes wrong it's like fucking people are getting dumber and dumber and dumber and more and more dangerous.

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:20.240
What are we going to do about it.

01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:22.240
Millennials.

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:26.240
Keep hashtagging.

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:31.240
Make sure hashtag keep hashtagging.

01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:34.240
Make sure everybody is real polite to each other.

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:37.240
There's a fucking fascist running for president.

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:39.240
And you can't do anything about it.

01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:41.240
Like there's nothing grab a brick.

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:45.240
Tell him I sent you grab a fucking brick and throw it through something.

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:48.240
I don't think I don't think Donald Trump was a fascist.

01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:51.240
I think that he no he's a fucking fascist.

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:52.240
I think this is not an argument.

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:59.240
I think he's a windsock he goes where that's what a fascist is exactly an opportunistic infection in a time of economic.

01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:06.240
He caters to people that like if he if he finds out that fascists will vote for him he will do exactly their bid.

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.240
That's what I said brother dog.

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.240
Don't don't irritate me.

01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.240
That's what I said.

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:15.240
But like but like Adolf Hitler sat in the cell and wrote down some like some terrible fucking horrible shit.

01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:18.240
I don't know if it was all that intelligent.

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:19.240
He just wrote it.

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:21.240
It's just time moves slower back.

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:22.240
That's all.

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:25.240
He's sat in a cell for four years and wrote a dumb ass book like Donald Trump was on a fucking reality show.

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:26.240
You're fired.

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.240
You're fired.

01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:31.240
Like it's just he's he's and he put on a baseball cap was like I'll be president.

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:34.240
Like it's like everyone's like yeah.

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:37.240
I'm going to associate that with the things that make me angry.

01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.240
And he's like OK.

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:40.240
I heard that like that's the scary.

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:48.240
I think there are more dangerous people in the Republican Party like they actually have more like for me like a little bit more like violent fascistic views.

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:50.240
They actually really do believe it.

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:53.240
I don't I don't know that Donald Trump particularly believes in anything at all.

01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:55.240
Why are we talking to a brick wall.

01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:56.240
That's what I'm saying.

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.240
That's what makes him dangerous.

01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.240
He's a fucking idiot.

01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:00.240
He doesn't believe in anything.

01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:07.240
That means that people who are their clockwork orging people they're fucking beating people with sticks.

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:13.240
And he's saying and then they're asking him about it on morning shows and he's going like well my fans are number one.

01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:18.240
Like like he's that's what's dangerous not a fucking guy who's like I'm going to take over the world.

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:19.240
Like like that guy's fine.

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.240
We've been living with that for 60 years.

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:26.240
Well like like like I'm saying this guy's a fucking a class number one dipshit.

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:30.240
Like he called Mexicans rapists and he's still running.

01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:32.240
He's still getting out of bed every morning.

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:38.240
He's just the right kind of dumb to fucking like make some horrible people able to do shit.

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:41.240
Like like like we're one step from like history here.

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.240
Yeah the whole thing now the whole like.

01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:44.240
And I was wrong by the way.

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:47.240
That's I forgot to mention that I fucking full retraction.

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:51.240
Remember when Erin went to Ireland and she's like everyone here is worried that Trump's going to be president.

01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:53.240
And I was like come on give us a fucking joke.

01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.240
I have never been wronger in my life.

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:57.240
I'm so wrong.

01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:58.240
I'm so terrified right now.

01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:05.240
He slipped 10 points in very recent history which is a pretty big drop percentage points.

01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:06.240
What do you think he finally did wrong.

01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:08.240
Did he like eat a baby.

01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:12.240
I think people just saw how good he was doing and be like we can't just stand by.

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:17.240
We got to vote in these polls.

01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:21.240
Polls.

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:25.240
Anybody here a Trump supporter and don't clap ironically anybody.

01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:28.240
I would love to meet somebody and not like not ironically.

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.240
I heard why I heard a guy and I was like like this is how they sound.

01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:37.240
So there was a guy because they were talking about that whole thing of how like well this is a fucking historical game changer where people are

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:41.240
physically beaten at your speeches and you don't condemn it.

01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:48.240
Like the and so they're asking this guy about it and he said his his his response.

01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:50.240
He was like a spokesman or something.

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.240
It was like a and he said come on.

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:53.240
This is just ridiculous.

01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:59.240
Like if it like what is every time a black man commits a crime is it Obama's fault.

01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:06.240
That's what the guy said was like what the fucking deep dark glance into like the weird weirdest fucking what the fuck.

01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:09.240
Like like that's what they sound like.

01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:12.240
That's skinhead talk dude.

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:14.240
Cowabunga.

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:17.240
That's fucking like that's scary.

01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:21.240
That guy was wearing a tie probably.

01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.240
He's probably older than me.

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:30.240
He's like old like like like like imagine like a imagine imagine when some of these fucking kids like like like like like you know like

01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:32.240
what does it take to flip them.

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:37.240
He's fucking these these kids like what does it really take to fucking flip them like on a fellow piece.

01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:40.240
You know like like they they love they love being team players.

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:41.240
They love they love code.

01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:43.240
They love language being right.

01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:46.240
They love like being like part of something bigger than them.

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:47.240
Like what is it.

01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:48.240
That terrifies me too.

01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:57.240
There's 90 degree intersection between a generation with a total capacity for fucking like teamwork and this like floppy haired

01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:03.240
weirdo going like America's used to be number one we should be the immigrants are bad.

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:08.240
Like like like I just worried about like like a 1980s V mini series happening here.

01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:17.240
It's like kids with red jumpsuits on going like I'm a visitor scout get off to the camps with you.

01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:21.240
If you're over 70 we got to eat you now.

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.240
We're going to make soap out of you.

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:31.240
Hashtag cancel Colbert.

01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:33.240
Anyways I just I just don't trust you guys.

01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.240
That's all.

01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:35.240
Don't take it personally.

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:37.240
I think that you might be slitting my throat tomorrow.

01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:40.240
You may I may be up against a wall.

01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:41.240
All right.

01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:42.240
Let's play shadow run.

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:43.240
Oh yeah.

01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:45.240
I love it.

01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:47.240

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.240
We haven't really figured out what it is yet.

01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.240
But we know we want these two things to happen.

01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:56.240
And we have one outline at the network right now.

01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:57.240
We have another outline being worked on.

01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:02.240
And I think we're going to figure out another outline to start getting worked on this week.

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:06.240
Are you doing things where like you'll Jessica and you Michael get your own script.

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.240

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:16.240
Yeah every script will be by Jessica Gao and Mike McMahon season.

01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:18.240
We were like Ryan Ridley too many scripts.

01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:19.240
Yeah.

01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:21.240
We need a Gal McMahon.

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:23.240
I don't know how to play this game.

01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:24.240
You'll find that neither do we.

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.240
So you're in good company.

01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:28.240
Yeah there's a character sheet there.

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:32.240
This is like a dark future like William Gibson kind of universe.

01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:34.240
You follow me.

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:35.240
Gal.

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:36.240
Who's William Gibson.

01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:38.240
Wait didn't we getting that wrong.

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:39.240
I don't know.

01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:40.240
I mean I'm ignorant here.

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.240
Wait I thought.

01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:43.240
Who is William Gibson.

01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:45.240
Answer that like I was dumb.

01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:47.240
The author of Neuromancer.

01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.240
Okay.

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:49.240
That's good to know.

01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:50.240
He invented cyberpunk right.

01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:51.240
I know what Neuromancer is.

01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:52.240
Sure.

01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:53.240
Yeah.

01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:54.240
I guess I shouldn't have been shocked.

01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:56.240
It wasn't your choice to play Shadowrun.

01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:57.240
I guess.

01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:58.240
Yeah more.

01:49:58.240 --> 01:49:59.240
We live in a distant future.

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:01.240
It's like D&D.

01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:03.240
It's improvised role playing.

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:06.240
But we live in the future so it's futuristic key.

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:07.240
But you can do whatever you want.

01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:10.240
And you have a list of weapons there that you might want to use if you get in trouble.

01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:11.240
Oh yeah.

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:14.240
Suspenser do you want to get us up to speed here and show us what we have.

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.240
I would love nothing more Jeff.

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:17.240
Real quick.

01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:19.240
Jessica your character is.

01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:20.240
Do you see.

01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:23.240
There's a lot of writing on these pages you guys.

01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:24.240
There's so many pages.

01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:25.240
Don't worry about it.

01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.240
Okay.

01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:27.240
Do you see the name here.

01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:29.240
My name is Hordegaard.

01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.240
You're Hordegaard.

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:31.240
Yeah.

01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.240
All right.

01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:36.240
So you're a troll doctor who means no harm and is kind of a weirdo.

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:38.240
And Mike you're a Mercy O'Donnell probably right.

01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:39.240
I'm Dr. Friend.

01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:40.240
Oh you're Dr. Friend.

01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.240
Fantastic.

01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:42.240
Okay.

01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:43.240
Wait.

01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:44.240
I got that wrong.

01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:45.240
Yeah Dr. Friend's a troll doctor.

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:46.240
Hordegaard is a.

01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:47.240
I'm a dwarf.

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:48.240
Hordegaard's a dwarf.

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.240
I'm a male troll.

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:50.240
Yeah.

01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:55.240
You're like a you're like a psychic Jessica who like like like has like psychic powers.

01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:56.240
I don't know.

01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.240
There's like should be a list of them somewhere out there.

01:50:58.240 --> 01:50:59.240
Yeah.

01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:00.240
And I weigh a hundred kilograms.

01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:03.240
And so that means Steve that you're probably playing Mercy right.

01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:04.240
I am Mercy.

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:05.240
All right.

01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:09.240
This recap was written by Peter Smith.

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.240
Thank you Peter Smith.

01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:13.240
All right.

01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:19.240
Last time on Shadowrun the gang assaulted a woman's mind until she asked them for help.

01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:23.240
She assigned them a mission to find her recovering ghoul daughter.

01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:28.240
Jam who lasts whose last known whereabouts were a flesh to fresh center.

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:34.240
After discussing strategy the gang decided their first stop will be the nano opium den.

01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:35.240
The golden hole.

01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:39.240
What will they learn from their mob contact David McChinaman.

01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:42.240
And who will they offend in the process.

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:46.240
Find out now on Harmon thing.

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:49.240
David McChinaman I assume named by Thomas Middleditch.

01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:50.240
Yep.

01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:51.240
Sorry.

01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:52.240
Sorry Jessica.

01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:56.240
Was it was it David David McChinaman or the Chinaman.

01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:57.240
No David McChinaman.

01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:58.240
David McChinaman.

01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.240
The Chinese person.

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:01.240
He's a little Irish.

01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:02.240
He's mostly Irish.

01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:03.240
A little bit right.

01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:08.240
He should eat at 23 and me and there was a little bit of Irish.

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:15.240
So we're going to the golden hole nano opium den to meet David McChinaman.

01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:16.240
Chinaman.

01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:19.240
Who's doctor friends contact in the mob.

01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:20.240
All right.

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:24.240
And maybe that contact will know something about the disappearance of the flesh to fresh franchise.

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:25.240
Yeah.

01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.240
All right.

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:29.240
So is our Uber pulled up to the golden hole.

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:31.240
It is now presently.

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:35.240
You roll up to a trash filled alleyway and your Uber comes to a halt.

01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:37.240
You see the back door to the golden hole.

01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:40.240
The nano opium den run by the golden six.

01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:43.240
A triad in the Seattle underground.

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:45.240
A triad's like a Chinese mafia.

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:48.240
Past the incinerator and piles of garbage bags.

01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:54.240
You can see a small metal door with a retro neon sign saying AR only club.

01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:58.240
Outside the door is a bald Asian man in a black suit and tie and shades.

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.240
AR only club.

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:01.240
AR only club.

01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:02.240
That's what the science.

01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:03.240
What does that mean?

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:05.240
That AR is what is it?

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:06.240
Augmented reality.

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:07.240
Augmented reality.

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:08.240
Yeah.

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:12.240
Which means it's a kind of it's a kind of technology that is used socially.

01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:13.240
Okay.

01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:18.240
So they won't they won't allow a VR in there.

01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:20.240
VR is like next level AR.

01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:25.240
If you have VR you could you could use it but it's part of your AR.

01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:27.240
This is engaging stuff.

01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:29.240
Do we all just have AR built in because we're future people.

01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:31.240
I mean I don't know that off hand.

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:32.240
I think some of you do.

01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:37.240
It's in your equipment which I'm sure will be easy for you to just skim and find.

01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:44.240
All I have is my nano like eyepiece for my contact lens that helps me like look at things.

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:45.240
Who are you playing Steve?

01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:46.240
I'm Mercy.

01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:47.240
Does that count Spencer?

01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:50.240
Well Mercy is the face man.

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:52.240
Like why don't you go talk to the bald bouncer.

01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:53.240
Okay.

01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:55.240
See if we can get a table for four.

01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:57.240
Table for five, six.

01:53:57.240 --> 01:53:59.240
Whatever anywhere.

01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:01.240
But are there actual oh okay yeah.

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:04.240
I'll come with you and stand five feet away.

01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:08.240
If things go bad I'll murder him.

01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:10.240
That's the way we do things.

01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:11.240
Hey.

01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:12.240
It really is.

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:14.240
Hey bouncer guy.

01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:16.240
Hey how's it going?

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:17.240
Welcome to the golden hole.

01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:18.240
Hello.

01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:19.240
What's your name?

01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:21.240
My name is Mercy.

01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:22.240
You're not on the list.

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:24.240
What can I help you with?

01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:26.240
I'm just curious about your establishment.

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:28.240
Oh it's an anopium den.

01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:30.240
I'm doing a lot of sniffing and licking around.

01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:32.240
It's an intimidation tactic.

01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:33.240
What's this guy doing?

01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:34.240
It's pretty weird.

01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:35.240
Yeah.

01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:36.240
Ignore him.

01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:37.240
Okay.

01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:38.240
He's eccentric.

01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:42.240
I would agree.

01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:44.240
So how do you get into this place?

01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:45.240
Do I need to like make some calls?

01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:46.240
Nah man.

01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:49.240
You just got to pay the cover fee per head.

01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:50.240
$500 million.

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:51.240
You know you can come on down.

01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:53.240
$500 new gets?

01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.240
New yen.

01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.240
New yen.

01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:57.240
They're like nougat.

01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:58.240
Per person?

01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:00.240
Yeah per head.

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:01.240
Alright.

01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:05.240
Ask them if we can get a deal for other people.

01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:06.240
Yeah.

01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:07.240
Can we get...

01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:08.240
Listen.

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:12.240
I'm a sweet lady and I know how clubs work.

01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:19.240
You know it's one dude for every woman.

01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:20.240
So...

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:24.240
It's a great ratio.

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:25.240
Yeah.

01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:26.240
Ideal.

01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:29.240
Is there...

01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:32.240
You know give us a dealier.

01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.240
Look at this eccentric guy.

01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:36.240
He's not going to do anything.

01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.240
He's literally sniffing walls.

01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:45.240
I can give a pretty lady like yourself a discount but a sniffy guy like this has to pay.

01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:47.240
What did you say to me?

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:49.240
I said you're a sniffy guy.

01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:50.240
Don't do that.

01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:52.240
You won't like him when he's angry.

01:55:52.240 --> 01:56:00.240
I mean it's my job to like or not like people in any state.

01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.240
Well that sounds like a lot more new yen than I have.

01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:08.240
Well maybe that's because the people playing you haven't recorded the new yen you've earned

01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:09.240
from your missions.

01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:11.240
We've got the new yen you guys.

01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:12.240
Alright everybody.

01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:13.240
Come on.

01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:14.240
Confidant.

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:15.240
500 new yen a piece.

01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:17.240
I put my 500 in the kitty.

01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:18.240
Alright thanks.

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:20.240
Here's some complimentary AR glasses.

01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:22.240
That's nice.

01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:23.240
On the house.

01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:24.240
It's nice.

01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:26.240
Is Captain EO playing tonight?

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:27.240
Oh.

01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:28.240
Captain EO.

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:29.240
What's that?

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:31.240
It's an AR show.

01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:32.240
It's really good.

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:33.240
It's before your time.

01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:35.240
No that was me the character you guys.

01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:37.240
I know who Captain EO is.

01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:42.240
Alright so I take my glasses and I walk into the golden hole.

01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.240
Alright you go down a small staircase into a dark room lit with red lights through your

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:52.240
AR glasses you can see overlaid with the real reality all sorts of virtual reality.

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:59.240
The virtual reality in question is largely rendered mists, red mists that add to the

01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:02.240
depth of the opium den mystique.

01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:05.240
Oh shit.

01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:06.880
Are we all getting high?

01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:08.740
You can smell the drugs.

01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:10.240
The good real...

01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:13.240
But I'm feeling them.

01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:14.240
You're feeling them.

01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:16.240
I'm feeling them drugs.

01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.240
The room though...

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:19.240
You know how I roll.

01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:22.240
The place is full of circular booths with hukas.

01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:24.240
There's people sitting at the hukas.

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:28.240
There's all sorts of business men and also dudes wearing Hawaiian shirts are just kind

01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:31.240
of sprawled out around the hukas.

01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:32.240
Opium and...

01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:38.240
I walk up to the bouncer and say hey do you know where David McChanaman is?

01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:40.240
We don't give out of those information.

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:41.240
This is a nano opium den.

01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:43.240
We can't just give out people's...

01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:47.240
We take out a thousand Nuiyan and I say do you know where David McManaman is?

01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:48.240
McManaman.

01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.240
McChinaman is.

01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:55.240
Madam, you understand that if I were to betray one of my sworn brothers, five lightning

01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:57.240
bolts would have to kill me.

01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:00.240
I take out 500 more Nuiyan.

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:05.240
You realize that if I accept a bribe from someone outside of the triads, myriads of knives

01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:07.240
will be forced to kill me.

01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:10.240
Can we just threaten this guy?

01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:11.240
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:15.240
In the recap they said that Dr. Friend invaded his brain.

01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:16.240
Yeah, you did somebody?

01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:17.240
Yeah, we...

01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:24.240
I think I know this guy and I hope there aren't any cyberware here because I hate them.

01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:25.240
Nice.

01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:30.240
They disgust me and I think they're less than people who are not cyberware.

01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:31.240
All right.

01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:32.240
All right.

01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:34.240
Dr. Friend, come on.

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:39.240
I approach the bouncer and I say hey, I'm Dr. Friend.

01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:41.240
I might be on the list and I know...

01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:43.240
We already got to ask the bouncer.

01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:45.240
Well, we all keep going back to the bouncer.

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:49.240
Let me handle this.

01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:53.240
I approach somebody near the front who looks like they know what's going on but they're

01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:57.240
not bouncing and I say, hi, I know David McChinaman.

01:58:57.240 --> 01:59:01.240
My name is Dr. Friend, but I'm not sure where in the establishment they are.

01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:04.240
It's very red and smoky and regular smoky at the same time.

01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:06.240
Could you point me in the right direction?

01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:08.240
David usually hangs out by the bathrooms.

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:09.240
You know, you should recognize them.

01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.240
Of course.

01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:11.240
You're friends.

01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:12.240
I should have remembered that.

01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:13.240
Thank you.

01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:14.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:15.240
Thank you very much.

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:16.240
I think we should head to the bathroom.

01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.240
Okay, let's go to the bathroom.

01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:18.240
If shit goes down, you're first.

01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:19.240
What?

01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:21.240
I said I'll take a run.

01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:22.240
I have to.

01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:23.240
Okay.

01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:24.240
Hey, hey, hey.

01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:30.240
I think, what are you, can't you scan the room for this guy or something?

01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:32.240
We know he's by the bathroom.

01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:34.240
Yeah, but do you know what he looks like?

01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:36.240
Yeah, I guess I do.

01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:37.240
I know him.

01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:38.240
But hold on, I get it.

01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:39.240
Do you want to scan the room?

01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:41.240
I mean, that's what the recap said.

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:42.240
Okay.

01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:43.240
I mean, yes.

01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:45.240
I assume I have scanning abilities.

01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:49.240
Yeah, you can scan for the presence of human life.

01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:50.240
Okay.

01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:52.240
Which is not helpful.

01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:53.240
Which is filling.

01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:54.240
I can do that.

01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:55.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:56.240
It's true.

01:59:56.240 --> 02:00:00.240
So I scan the room and have determined that the club is filled with human life.

02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:01.240
Yeah.

02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:02.240
Come on.

02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:03.240
Over to the bathroom.

02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:05.240
Everybody, let's go to the bathroom.

02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:06.240
Over to the bathroom.

02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:09.240
All right, I scan the bathroom and I find...

02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:10.240
Don't scan the...

02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:11.240
Don't scan the bathroom?

02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:13.240
What are you, cyberware?

02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:14.240
No, don't...

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:15.240
No.

02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:16.240
He hates that.

02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:17.240
He hates it.

02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:18.240
He's psychic.

02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:19.240
He hates it.

02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:24.240
Look, I'm just very confused right now, both by what's happening and by why this world is so Asian.

02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:25.240
Okay?

02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:28.240
I mean, come on.

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:29.240
It's Seattle.

02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:30.240
It's Seattle.

02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:31.240
It's...

02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:34.240
Even in the future, Seattle is kind of Asian, so...

02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:35.240
All right.

02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:36.240
Right by the bathroom.

02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:37.240
All right.

02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:38.240
Dr. Friend, come on.

02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:39.240
Find this guy.

02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:40.240
Dr. Friend, do you see...

02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:41.240
I look around.

02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:42.240
I assume...

02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:43.240
I look around to see if he's there.

02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:44.240
Is he my friend there?

02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:45.240
Oh, yeah.

02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:46.240
Yeah.

02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:47.240
Right by the bathroom.

02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.240
Oh, we approach him.

02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:49.240
You see your old friend, David McChinaman.

02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:50.240
He's wearing a mint polo shirt.

02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:53.240
He's crunched over a cyber hookah.

02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:55.240
He's hitting it.

02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:59.240
Beep, boop, my shleemo.

02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:00.240
How's it going?

02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:01.240
I see the...

02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:02.240
Beep, boop!

02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:05.240
Wow, he...

02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:06.240
All right.

02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:07.240
He can talk the talk.

02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:08.240
Oh, man.

02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:10.240
He's gone way back.

02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:11.240
You again.

02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:14.240
I'm not dying, am I?

02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:17.240
Because you patched me up because I was dying.

02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:19.240
I'm just here to check on your condition.

02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:23.240
You're looking well to be consuming so many augmented drugs.

02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:24.240
Yeah, man.

02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:26.240
Pull up a cyber beanbag.

02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:28.240
Take some of this nano-opium.

02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:32.240
May my...

02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:34.240
Well, first of all, thank you.

02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:39.240
And I'm here to introduce my digital compatriots.

02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:40.240
You're gonna have to...

02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:41.240
Just talk to them.

02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:43.240
Find out where the thing is.

02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:44.240
Find out where Gem is.

02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:45.240
Where Gem is.

02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:46.240
Are you talking about Gem?

02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:47.240
Gem, yeah.

02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:50.240
Sorry for the momentary muttering.

02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:52.240
But do you know where...

02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:53.240
Sorry, just one second.

02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:54.240
Gem's a person, not a gem.

02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:55.240
Gem is a person.

02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:56.240
Her name is Gem.

02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:58.240
She was turned into a...

02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:00.240
She's kind of turned into a ghoul.

02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:03.240
We have to find out where she is to get her back to her parents.

02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:05.240
All right, I'm turning my AR back on.

02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:08.240
He couldn't hear any of that stuff on the AR.

02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:10.240
Do you know where Gem is?

02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:11.240
I'm looking for Gem.

02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:12.240
Daughter of Peggy.

02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:13.240
Daughter of Pet...

02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:14.240
Gem, daughter of Peggy.

02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:15.240
I don't know any of those people.

02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:16.240
Let's...

02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:17.240
No.

02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.240
Doctor Friend.

02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:19.240
No, no.

02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:21.240
Doctor Friend, ask him if he knows what happened to the

02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:23.240
Flesh to Fresh franchise.

02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:24.240
What happened to that?

02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:26.240
I know this is going to sound crazy, David,

02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:30.240
but do you know what happened to the...

02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:31.240
Fresh to Flesh...

02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:33.240
Flesh to Fresh.

02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:35.240
Flesh to Fresh franchise.

02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:38.240
Yeah, Flesh to Fresh.

02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:41.240
That's those ghoul clinics, right?

02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:42.240
They're popping up all over the place.

02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:44.240
They're disappearing.

02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:46.240
Yes, yeah, yeah.

02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:48.240
Yeah, you know, I've heard of those.

02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:51.240
They get on the news because a new one pops up.

02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:52.240
You hear all about it.

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:53.240
It's super successful.

02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:54.240
That's the next thing you know.

02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:55.240
There's a fire.

02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:56.240
You never hear from them again.

02:02:56.240 --> 02:03:02.240
Well, we've all seen the news, but do you have any non-jews?

02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:03.240
Insider.

02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:08.240
Have you maybe picked up any info from lounging in the digital drug den?

02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.240
That maybe the common news watcher might not know?

02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:15.240
I mean, I did patch you up, so...

02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:17.240
Jessica, scan them.

02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:18.240
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:19.240
Thank you.

02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:21.240
My name is Hordegard.

02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:22.240
Whoa.

02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:26.240
Only my family calls me Jessica.

02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:29.240
Experience points.

02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:36.240
All right, so I scan him and determine he is a living organism.

02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:38.240
Yeah, no, because I patched him up.

02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:39.240
He's living.

02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:41.240
No, he invaded his brain.

02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:42.240
Sorry.

02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:46.240
He indeed knows more than he's letting on.

02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:47.240
Well, go get it.

02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:48.240
Go take it.

02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:51.240
Oh, I dig around inside his brain.

02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:57.240
Oh, you see, you see, you see initiation rites from the triads and all sorts of ceremonies

02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:01.240
and all sorts of family meals around the table.

02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:07.240
Wondrous times and also dangerous times, you know, like just general mob things that happen

02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:10.240
to mob people is entering your mind.

02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:12.240
The guy is, he's screaming.

02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:14.240
He's screaming so loud.

02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:17.240
He's like, ah, my mind is being probed.

02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:18.240
It's...

02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:19.240
Good night.

02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:22.240
Hey, guys, don't do the yellow nano opium.

02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:29.240
Six security guards show up with guns.

02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:31.240
What's going on?

02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:32.240
My bad, guys.

02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:33.240
My bad.

02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:34.240
Scan them.

02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:36.240
I'll scan the security guard.

02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:39.240
One of the security guards starts screaming.

02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:41.240
He's like, ah, my mind.

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:43.240
Everyone has such a horrible memory.

02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:46.240
He just keeps scanning everybody.

02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:50.240
We're going to wave the red dust in the air so you can keep scanning.

02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.240
That's a hologram, that dust.

02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:55.240
I'm scanning everybody and then I accidentally scan Mercy.

02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.240
All right.

02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:58.240
Oh, man.

02:04:58.240 --> 02:04:59.240
Oh, God.

02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:00.240
Stop.

02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:02.240
My brain.

02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:03.240
It feels really good for me.

02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:04.240
I'm sorry.

02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:05.240
It doesn't matter.

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:08.240
She didn't give her consent to be scanned.

02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:09.240
That's true.

02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:15.240
I said to David McChime, hey, look, we came here hoping to find out some information.

02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:16.240
We'll make it worth your while.

02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:21.240
If you can give us a lead on this, this Peggy has a daughter named Gem we're looking for

02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:26.240
and the flesh to fresh franchise just keep disappearing and the last time she was seen

02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:27.240
was at this place.

02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:32.240
Anything you can do, we'll make it worth your while if you can give us any lead on this stuff.

02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:33.240
Mr. McChineman.

02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:34.240
Well.

02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:36.240
If that is your real name.

02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:38.240
I got to take him in.

02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:39.240
I got to be honest with you.

02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:40.240
He's breathing heavily.

02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:42.240
He seems a little worse for wear.

02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:45.240
This is the other security guard.

02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:48.240
The other five security guards haven't haven't left.

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.240
They're just standing around you guys.

02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:53.240
But they don't seem like they're going to do anything.

02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:54.240
Okay.

02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:55.240
You guys are right.

02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:56.240
I'm pain.

02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:58.240
I'm going to put my glasses on.

02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:00.240
Why are you in pain?

02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:02.240
Because I got my mind probed.

02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:03.240
What?

02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:04.240
Yeah.

02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:05.240
Jessica probed my mind.

02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:06.240
She was doing a probes.

02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:07.240
Her name isn't Jessica.

02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:08.240
Her name is Jessica.

02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:09.240
Her name is Jessica.

02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:10.240
Her name is Jessica.

02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:11.240
Her name is Jessica.

02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:12.240
Her name is Jessica.

02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:13.240
She's a woman.

02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:15.240
Oh, I must have missed that.

02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:16.240
I'm sorry.

02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:17.240
Sorry about that.

02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:18.240
You're a being probed.

02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:19.240
Alright.

02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:20.240
So a couple things.

02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:22.240
I don't think the girl was ever actually last seen here.

02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:25.240
I mean there was really no good reason for us to come here.

02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:27.240
Like this is someplace that we can't.

02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:28.240
Didn't we think that the mob would know something about the

02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:29.240
disappearance?

02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:30.240
We didn't think that.

02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:32.240
But like it wasn't again, we're just bad shadow runners.

02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:36.240
So I kind of like, I square off with the security guys.

02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:39.240
And I just kind of, I give him a professional nod.

02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:45.960
like you know it's obvious from my face and like look we're both paid to make

02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:52.240
