{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:11.360\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the nerdest, meltyest theater in the world,\n\n00:11.360 --> 00:20.280\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:20.280 --> 00:34.080\nLet's bring out Spencer Crittenden, shall we, Spencer?\n\n00:34.080 --> 00:37.160\nThey love you, Spencer.\n\n00:37.160 --> 00:39.040\nThis song again?\n\n00:39.040 --> 00:40.040\nHow dare you.\n\n00:40.040 --> 00:41.040\nJesus.\n\n00:41.040 --> 00:42.440\nLet's bring out the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n00:42.440 --> 00:43.440\nYou know him.\n\n00:43.440 --> 00:44.440\nYou might like him.\n\n00:44.440 --> 00:45.440\nDan Harmon.\n\n00:45.440 --> 00:46.440\nThank you very much.\n\n00:46.440 --> 00:56.520\nHappy Thanksgiving.\n\n00:56.520 --> 00:58.240\nHappy Happy Thanksgiving.\n\n00:58.240 --> 01:14.800\nUnless you're Jewish, I think a round Thanksgiving, yeah, pour them, sure, kind of ruined whatever\n\n01:14.800 --> 01:20.920\ndumb bit I was about to do, there actually is a Jewish Thanksgiving in the vicinity.\n\n01:20.920 --> 01:24.720\nYeah, no, they're less thankful this time of year.\n\n01:24.720 --> 01:25.720\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:25.720 --> 01:30.000\nBut they do it, they're thankful, they're a little bit thankful for eight days in a\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:31.000\nrow.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:35.120\nThey get a little, two ounces of stuffing every day.\n\n01:35.120 --> 01:37.480\nDid you eat a lot over your Thanksgiving?\n\n01:37.480 --> 01:42.120\nYeah, a little ham.\n\n01:42.120 --> 01:44.120\nYou're making a poopy face.\n\n01:44.120 --> 01:45.120\nWhat's a denero face?\n\n01:45.120 --> 01:49.800\nI had a little ham.\n\n01:49.800 --> 01:53.040\nI was thankful.\n\n01:53.040 --> 01:56.800\nThe denero face you're making is denero's poopy face, though, it's when denero doesn't\n\n01:56.800 --> 01:57.800\nlike ham.\n\n01:57.800 --> 01:58.800\nThe ham wasn't very good.\n\n01:58.800 --> 01:59.800\nIt wasn't good ham.\n\n01:59.800 --> 02:00.800\nToo salty, too dry?\n\n02:00.800 --> 02:01.800\nI don't know.\n\n02:01.800 --> 02:02.800\nIt was hammy.\n\n02:02.800 --> 02:09.520\nHey, we've discussed this, ham is not a real, it's silly, it's a silly meat.\n\n02:09.520 --> 02:12.960\nWe remember when I was going to go to Barcelona and you're like, oh, the ham, they're known\n\n02:12.960 --> 02:13.960\nfor their ham.\n\n02:13.960 --> 02:14.960\nThe ham's dumb.\n\n02:14.960 --> 02:21.080\nAnd then I got off the plane and they're like, here's your ham, for real, in a bag,\n\n02:21.080 --> 02:23.360\ngive me a bag of ham.\n\n02:23.360 --> 02:25.800\nBarcelona ham never comes in a bag.\n\n02:25.800 --> 02:34.800\nNo, it was like sealed, like kind of like artisanal ham, I don't know, ham, ham shreds.\n\n02:34.800 --> 02:40.120\nA guy named Arturo was supposed to cut it off a dried carcass hanging from the ceiling.\n\n02:40.120 --> 02:48.160\nI know we're all very tired tonight, it's been a long weekend, we've all, like, some\n\n02:48.160 --> 02:53.600\nof us have probably had encounters with family members that we didn't want to have.\n\n02:53.600 --> 02:58.920\nSome of us probably, even the people that had a great time, I'm one of them, but you\n\n02:58.920 --> 03:00.760\nknow, there's an exhaustion level.\n\n03:00.760 --> 03:04.840\nDid you speak to any, I know you weren't with your family, did you speak to any of your\n\n03:04.840 --> 03:05.840\nfamily?\n\n03:05.840 --> 03:08.080\nNo.\n\n03:08.080 --> 03:14.000\nMy dad sent me a text, kind of making fun of me.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:20.720\nHe said, I didn't really get his joke, what did he say, he said, it dawns on me that without\n\n03:20.720 --> 03:28.880\na DNA test, you'd still be Irish, you'd still be married.\n\n03:28.880 --> 03:29.880\nWait what?\n\n03:29.880 --> 03:35.920\nI think he means like, because I got that DNA test, and I always thought I was Irish\n\n03:35.920 --> 03:43.480\nancestrally, and Aaron was, very much so, and I turned out to be British, more British\n\n03:43.480 --> 03:49.360\nthan James Bond, and with zero Irish in me, and I think my dad is just referencing that,\n\n03:49.360 --> 03:55.240\nhe's just sending me a note on Thanksgiving to just say, maybe it's your fault that you\n\n03:55.240 --> 03:56.240\naren't married.\n\n03:56.240 --> 04:02.240\nIf you were actually Irish, you would have made it work, out of Irish solidarity.\n\n04:02.240 --> 04:09.760\nYeah, and that's the key with marriages, you want to make it work, if it's not working\n\n04:09.760 --> 04:17.040\non its own, you want to put an effort, really, you just work on it, just wrench away at it,\n\n04:17.040 --> 04:21.920\nlike it's an old Camaro, because who wouldn't want to be in a marriage that had been made\n\n04:21.920 --> 04:27.200\nto work?\n\n04:27.200 --> 04:31.480\nBut you have to agree that all relationships have some work, like elements to it.\n\n04:31.480 --> 04:34.760\nOf course, if you're in a partnership with someone, you have to make emotional bids and\n\n04:34.760 --> 04:43.560\nrespond to them, I know all this, I learned all this, didn't help, but I learned it all.\n\n04:43.560 --> 04:50.320\nI watched that new Mission Impossible movie, Rogue Nation, so Jeff, you probably haven't\n\n04:50.320 --> 04:51.320\nseen it.\n\n04:51.320 --> 04:53.120\nI'm guessing you watched it on a plane, right?\n\n04:53.120 --> 05:01.000\nNo, no, I watched it tonight, I was waiting for Fallout 4 to load, and I, I mean it's not\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:06.560\nfunny, it's a, it's a terrible addiction, it's going to cost Rick and Morty a lot of\n\n05:06.560 --> 05:07.560\nmoney.\n\n05:07.560 --> 05:11.560\nNow, all I know, all I know about these Mission Impossible, I think I've seen one of them.\n\n05:11.560 --> 05:17.520\nWell, so here's the thing, okay, so this is like the seventh one, like, and I hope, I\n\n05:17.520 --> 05:22.160\nhope I don't, you know, you don't mind me spoiling it, but this one is like, this one,\n\n05:22.160 --> 05:29.320\nthis one, the Mission is like, like, they can't do it, no, but he's done six in a row.\n\n05:29.320 --> 05:34.280\nAnd well, there's always a little bit of a snafu, but this one is like, can't be done.\n\n05:34.280 --> 05:40.160\nIt's actually, that'll be a good Mission Impossible, they go, oh shit, it was impossible.\n\n05:40.160 --> 05:46.080\nHe gets up at the end and he's like, well, it's on the poster, like, yeah, and he says\n\n05:46.080 --> 05:52.440\nlike, look, yeah, six to seven isn't bad, and he just walks away, and I'm proud of him.\n\n05:52.440 --> 05:54.880\nLike, he's, he's been working really hard.\n\n05:54.880 --> 05:58.040\nBabe Ruth only hits, you know, maybe two and a half, three out of ten.\n\n05:58.040 --> 06:01.960\nYeah, and it's not called, you can't hit the ball, it's called baseball.\n\n06:01.960 --> 06:02.960\nYeah.\n\n06:02.960 --> 06:03.960\nYou know?\n\n06:03.960 --> 06:07.800\nThis is like, his job is to go do things that can't be done, and he, but he does them\n\n06:07.800 --> 06:08.800\nall the time.\n\n06:08.800 --> 06:09.800\nBut this one, but.\n\n06:09.800 --> 06:15.120\nSo he took one, so he took one, this time he couldn't do it, and I thought, I thought,\n\n06:15.120 --> 06:18.840\nI, for what I was, I was refreshed, I was, I was like, that's great, he couldn't do\n\n06:18.840 --> 06:19.840\nit.\n\n06:19.840 --> 06:23.440\nThat would make me come back to the Mission Impossible franchise if number seven, oh\n\n06:23.440 --> 06:26.320\nfuck it, he fucking, that was, that one was actually impossible.\n\n06:26.320 --> 06:29.240\nYou know, every once in a while, the mission is actually impossible.\n\n06:29.240 --> 06:31.040\nThe word still means something.\n\n06:31.040 --> 06:36.280\nIt's like the Harlem Globetrotters one time did lose to the generals.\n\n06:36.280 --> 06:37.280\nThat's on record.\n\n06:37.280 --> 06:41.280\nThat's a reference for nobody here.\n\n06:41.280 --> 06:49.400\nSo, so there's a scene in Mission Impossible nine, whatever this is, where Ving Reims keeps\n\n06:49.400 --> 06:50.400\ncoming back.\n\n06:50.400 --> 06:54.800\nWait, wait, that little snort you did sounded like when you hit backspace on a computer,\n\n06:54.800 --> 07:00.600\na keyboard, you're like, do that again, can you make that again?\n\n07:00.600 --> 07:06.360\nSo Ving Reims keeps coming back as the computer hacker with the words a hat and he, his name\n\n07:06.360 --> 07:07.360\nis Luther.\n\n07:07.360 --> 07:12.160\nAnd, and so he, there's a scene like in Grand Central Station or something, I don't know,\n\n07:12.160 --> 07:17.440\nsome subway station where the girls meeting with Tom Cruise and everyone's listening\n\n07:17.440 --> 07:22.360\nand their earpieces and, and then, and then the Tom Cruise is going, what about the hard\n\n07:22.360 --> 07:27.200\ndrive, what about the list of the hard drives with all the, all the lists of all the hard\n\n07:27.200 --> 07:28.200\ndrives on them?\n\n07:28.200 --> 07:31.920\nAnd, and, and it's like, why did the prime minister want the thing, you're going to double\n\n07:31.920 --> 07:33.440\ndown on the hard drive?\n\n07:33.440 --> 07:37.440\nAnd she's like, what do you think you're doing, you're playing right into his hand with the\n\n07:37.440 --> 07:38.440\nhard drive.\n\n07:38.440 --> 07:41.600\nYou're going, you're going to make a, you're going to lose the list.\n\n07:41.600 --> 07:42.600\nThat's all you want.\n\n07:42.600 --> 07:43.600\nShe's playing into his hand.\n\n07:43.600 --> 07:44.600\nWhich character is this person?\n\n07:44.600 --> 07:45.600\nWho's that?\n\n07:45.600 --> 07:48.160\nShe's like the femme fatale, like, you know, is she, who's side is she on?\n\n07:48.160 --> 07:51.160\nWhat's she, what's she, does she, does she, can she do missions?\n\n07:51.160 --> 07:57.160\nLike, you know, like, we don't know, like, am I six, am I nine, like what a CIA, we don't\n\n07:57.160 --> 08:00.880\nknow what's going on, everyone's, everyone's wearing a mask and, you know, and so she's\n\n08:00.880 --> 08:05.040\nlike, she's like, no, look out for that list, you're going to get that list for the guy.\n\n08:05.040 --> 08:07.920\nAnd he's like, what if I don't get the list and she's like, well, then he's going to kill\n\n08:07.920 --> 08:08.920\nyou.\n\n08:08.920 --> 08:11.480\nHe's like, oh, that's, I'm going to have to blah, blah, blah.\n\n08:11.480 --> 08:16.240\nAnd so then something happens and they go like, ow, ow, there's like a distraction.\n\n08:16.240 --> 08:27.840\nAnd, and they, and they, and they take Simon Pegg, they kidnap him.\n\n08:27.840 --> 08:28.840\nThat was all women.\n\n08:28.840 --> 08:29.840\nAll women.\n\n08:29.840 --> 08:30.840\nNo.\n\n08:30.840 --> 08:31.840\nHe's adorable.\n\n08:31.840 --> 08:32.840\nYeah.\n\n08:32.840 --> 08:33.840\nHe's adorable.\n\n08:33.840 --> 08:41.840\nHe might have been a couple of guys sounding like women, but that was all unanimous.\n\n08:41.840 --> 08:44.520\nIt might have been the woman inside a lot of men.\n\n08:44.520 --> 08:45.520\nYeah.\n\n08:45.520 --> 08:49.120\nIt's like, how can I make when Simon Pegg is kidnapped?\n\n08:49.120 --> 08:51.760\nUm, the, I don't know why I'm staring.\n\n08:51.760 --> 08:53.040\nThere's nothing written on here.\n\n08:53.040 --> 08:59.000\nThe, the, the, the, the, the, but it's just, there's something funny happening.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:02.360\nLike, like, like Simon Pegg gets kidnapped and then it's a big crisis and Tom Cruise\n\n09:02.360 --> 09:06.760\nis like, ah, they took Simon Pegg and, and it's like, I'm going to go get him.\n\n09:06.760 --> 09:11.800\nAnd then, and then like, like, you, you, uh, uh, Jeremy Renner, you, you, you go get\n\n09:11.800 --> 09:18.040\nthe list or the binoculars and, uh, uh, uh, who's, who's, who's another guy.\n\n09:18.040 --> 09:19.880\nThere's another guy there.\n\n09:19.880 --> 09:23.360\nIt's like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Tom Scarec.\n\n09:23.360 --> 09:26.980\nTom Scarec, go, go, go buy some t-shirts to, to, to the, we have a paper trailer.\n\n09:26.980 --> 09:27.980\nWe were here.\n\n09:27.980 --> 09:34.660\nUm, but then so they're all like scattering, but then Tom Cruise says, Luther, stay with\n\n09:34.660 --> 09:35.660\nher.\n\n09:35.660 --> 09:41.600\nSo this girl is like a super karate like, like, like she's like 25 and can like fly\n\n09:41.600 --> 09:45.080\nLike she's like, she's like, that's her gimmick is she can like,\n\n09:45.080 --> 09:48.120\nlike if you try to shoot her, she'll be like inside your gun.\n\n09:48.120 --> 09:51.440\nAnd then, like, and then she's like giving you the Heimlich\n\n09:51.440 --> 09:52.480\nfrom inside your gun.\n\n09:52.480 --> 09:54.400\nAnd then she hands you the gun.\n\n09:54.400 --> 09:56.360\nAnd then she's like, maybe you want to kill me.\n\n09:56.360 --> 09:59.000\nAnd then you try to get the gun again, but now it's backward.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.840\nSo you shoot yourself like, and she's just like,\n\n10:01.840 --> 10:03.920\nshe's just dancing all over the place and just like,\n\n10:03.920 --> 10:08.400\nshe just runs on your shoulders and, and just like walking on your hat.\n\n10:08.400 --> 10:10.720\nAnd she's in your hat and then she's down your pants.\n\n10:10.720 --> 10:13.440\nAnd, and out your zipper and just slapping you.\n\n10:13.440 --> 10:14.640\nAnd she's, she's M.I.\n\n10:14.640 --> 10:17.880\nSex. I mean, that's what they, they train them for that.\n\n10:17.880 --> 10:19.600\nExcept Simon Pegg is not trained for that.\n\n10:19.600 --> 10:21.440\nI think he's inside the guns.\n\n10:21.440 --> 10:24.000\nThe worst place to hide when someone's trying to shoot you.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:24.800\nYou're overthinking it.\n\n10:24.800 --> 10:25.240\nOkay.\n\n10:25.240 --> 10:27.520\nShe's a, she's a, she's a, she's a fierce combatant.\n\n10:27.520 --> 10:33.120\nShe's a young, agile, British lady with the grace of a, of a ballerina\n\n10:33.120 --> 10:38.400\nand the lethality of a, of a, of a, of a, of a New York cop.\n\n10:38.400 --> 10:43.680\nUh, uh, uh, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on labor day.\n\n10:47.680 --> 10:50.800\nI started like, oh, why don't you riff something topical that's deadly?\n\n10:50.800 --> 10:53.680\nAnd then I was like, no, don't just don't.\n\n10:54.880 --> 10:58.800\nSo I, I, the, the, so, so she's like, spry.\n\n10:58.800 --> 11:03.760\nAnd it's like something, some time Chris goes, Luther, stay with her.\n\n11:03.760 --> 11:06.640\nLike, like as in keep her from going away.\n\n11:06.640 --> 11:07.040\nYeah.\n\n11:07.040 --> 11:08.480\nWhich is insane.\n\n11:08.480 --> 11:09.520\nLike I laughed out loud.\n\n11:09.520 --> 11:11.120\nI was like, Luther, stay with her.\n\n11:11.120 --> 11:14.160\nCause he was like, he's on the other side of the thing.\n\n11:14.160 --> 11:17.200\nAnd it's because she might be a threat if we take her eyes off her.\n\n11:17.200 --> 11:19.520\nWell, yeah, she can't be allowed to get away.\n\n11:19.520 --> 11:23.680\nLike at all by any, by any means, no, cannot let her go.\n\n11:23.680 --> 11:26.160\nLike, like it's very important that she stay where she is.\n\n11:26.160 --> 11:28.880\nSo he puts Bing Reims in charge of that.\n\n11:28.880 --> 11:34.880\nBut it's like, it's just kind of, he's 90 and he's 900 pounds.\n\n11:34.880 --> 11:40.160\nAnd, and, and I, so it's already funny that just him saying Luther, stay with her.\n\n11:40.160 --> 11:43.440\nCause her gimmick is like that she can like walk on telephone wires.\n\n11:43.440 --> 11:45.440\nAnd so, but then they just do this thing.\n\n11:45.440 --> 11:50.720\nAnd I just, like they do this weirdly edited thing where like, I feel like\n\n11:50.720 --> 11:55.200\nBing Reims demanded this, like in his contract, when he saw the script, he's like, look,\n\n11:55.200 --> 11:57.120\nit says Luther, stay with her.\n\n11:57.120 --> 11:58.480\nAnd then she gets away.\n\n11:58.480 --> 12:02.400\nLike, could we, could we, could we add a couple pages to the script?\n\n12:02.400 --> 12:04.000\nLike, I make an effort.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:10.160\nYeah. We're like, it's like, if she gets away, like she's lucky, she got away.\n\n12:10.160 --> 12:12.240\nAnd so there's just this long shot.\n\n12:12.240 --> 12:16.480\nIt just keeps cutting back and forth between the girls sitting at a table.\n\n12:16.480 --> 12:18.720\nSo somebody's, somebody's helping out.\n\n12:18.720 --> 12:19.600\nAll right.\n\n12:19.600 --> 12:24.000\nThe, the, the girl's sitting at the table and it keeps cutting back and forth between\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:24.880\nher and Bing Reims.\n\n12:24.880 --> 12:27.840\nWho's like, he's dog paddling through people.\n\n12:27.840 --> 12:30.400\nLike there's just like all of these people are like walking into him.\n\n12:30.400 --> 12:37.280\nAnd he's just, they're like, and then it keeps cutting back to her.\n\n12:37.280 --> 12:38.480\nAnd there's like five shots.\n\n12:38.480 --> 12:39.840\nAnd she's sitting at a table.\n\n12:39.840 --> 12:40.720\nYeah.\n\n12:40.720 --> 12:44.000\nAnd then they do a thing where it pans around somebody and then she's gone.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:48.800\nBut he's a very large man and he, they shouldn't have left him in charge.\n\n12:51.600 --> 12:54.160\nI told you, I don't, I don't have anything to talk about tonight.\n\n12:54.720 --> 12:57.840\nSpencer, do you, do you have any Thanksgiving festivities?\n\n12:57.840 --> 12:58.320\nWhoa.\n\n12:58.320 --> 12:58.720\nAll right.\n\n12:58.720 --> 13:01.440\nI've been fired man.\n\n13:01.440 --> 13:02.560\nNo, I'm fired.\n\n13:02.560 --> 13:05.280\nWhere is the goddamn fucking liquor?\n\n13:06.240 --> 13:07.840\nOh, shit.\n\n13:07.840 --> 13:09.360\nAnd I got some other reprimands.\n\n13:09.360 --> 13:13.200\nWhat the hell was that goddamn Daft Punk shit you were playing before the show?\n\n13:15.520 --> 13:17.440\nYou just goddamn emo.\n\n13:18.080 --> 13:19.840\nDustin Marshall everybody.\n\n13:19.840 --> 13:21.840\nIt's Vernon Chapman from Wondership.\n\n13:21.840 --> 13:22.560\nOh, okay.\n\n13:22.560 --> 13:23.440\nAll right.\n\n13:23.440 --> 13:24.080\nHigh-roaded.\n\n13:24.080 --> 13:28.720\nHe's a very brilliant comedy writer.\n\n13:29.680 --> 13:30.720\nIt was who?\n\n13:30.720 --> 13:31.600\nVernon Chapman.\n\n13:31.600 --> 13:32.640\nOh, I love Vernon Chapman.\n\n13:32.640 --> 13:33.600\nThat was his music?\n\n13:33.600 --> 13:33.840\nYeah.\n\n13:37.200 --> 13:37.760\nYeah.\n\n13:37.760 --> 13:38.320\nI mean.\n\n13:38.320 --> 13:40.240\nHe's famous for his comedy.\n\n13:41.920 --> 13:43.680\nAnd that was his music.\n\n13:43.680 --> 13:47.680\nHe also, he also might be famous for being a really good, a guy that does music.\n\n13:47.680 --> 13:51.200\nIt's not good to start a comedy show with before, before the thing.\n\n13:52.080 --> 13:52.640\nHe is awesome.\n\n13:52.640 --> 13:54.720\nVernon Chapman had one of my favorite openers of all time.\n\n13:54.720 --> 13:55.520\nHe came out on stage.\n\n13:56.560 --> 13:59.200\nVernon Chapman, everybody, he's super, if you don't know him, he's very deadpan.\n\n13:59.200 --> 14:00.720\nFantastic writer of great comic.\n\n14:01.520 --> 14:03.600\nAnd he came out on stage at the Laugh Factory.\n\n14:03.600 --> 14:04.720\nApplause, applause, applause, applause.\n\n14:04.720 --> 14:06.480\nAnd he just looks at the crowd, like totally deadpan.\n\n14:06.480 --> 14:11.360\nHe says, Stephen Hawking, sure, he can talk the talk.\n\n14:11.360 --> 14:21.760\nAnd stood there for two minutes to absolutely no acclaim.\n\n14:23.600 --> 14:25.520\nThe Laugh Factory crowd was not with that joke at all.\n\n14:25.520 --> 14:26.080\nOh, really?\n\n14:26.080 --> 14:27.200\nOh, no.\n\n14:27.200 --> 14:27.920\nThat's awful.\n\n14:27.920 --> 14:29.280\nThat was really funny.\n\n14:29.280 --> 14:31.920\nMe and Fred Balford and Andy Kiddler in the background shitting ourselves.\n\n14:33.600 --> 14:34.400\nOkay.\n\n14:34.400 --> 14:34.640\nAll right.\n\n14:34.640 --> 14:36.480\nSo there's one more thing written on here.\n\n14:36.480 --> 14:37.040\nAll right.\n\n14:37.040 --> 14:39.760\nNow, I know I'm not going to garner any sympathy from those God knows,\n\n14:39.760 --> 14:42.400\nnot a Simon Pegg abduction level of...\n\n14:42.400 --> 14:43.200\nOh.\n\n14:45.200 --> 14:48.720\nBut I'm having a lot of trouble updating my iWatch software.\n\n14:50.480 --> 14:52.480\nI thought you had forsaken the iWatch.\n\n14:52.480 --> 14:55.120\nI had kind of thrown it in the garbage, basically.\n\n14:55.120 --> 14:57.360\nLike I threw it in like a duffel bag and forgot about it.\n\n14:57.360 --> 15:00.480\nSo now it's like, now there's this new software for it.\n\n15:00.480 --> 15:02.640\nSo I was like, I'm going to put on the new software.\n\n15:03.440 --> 15:05.680\nAnd I tried, but I can't do it.\n\n15:05.680 --> 15:06.800\nAnd it won't work.\n\n15:06.800 --> 15:07.840\nIt keeps not working.\n\n15:07.840 --> 15:10.880\nIt keeps not installing the new software on the old watch.\n\n15:10.880 --> 15:12.960\nAnd then I looked at the features.\n\n15:13.520 --> 15:21.040\nIt says in the iOS 2 for the watch, one of the features that it fixes is...\n\n15:21.040 --> 15:24.560\nIt says, fixes an issue that could cause software updates to stall.\n\n15:28.720 --> 15:29.200\nZiggy.\n\n15:31.760 --> 15:32.160\nAll right.\n\n15:33.600 --> 15:35.520\nSo what's your stance on the iWatch now?\n\n15:35.520 --> 15:37.200\nYou're wearing this only because there was an update\n\n15:37.200 --> 15:38.320\nand you wanted to see what was what?\n\n15:38.320 --> 15:39.760\nWell, yeah, I got excited about it.\n\n15:39.760 --> 15:40.240\nYeah.\n\n15:40.240 --> 15:40.640\nI don't know.\n\n15:40.640 --> 15:42.080\nI thought I'd give you another chance.\n\n15:42.080 --> 15:44.240\nYou're a little, you're a little fucker.\n\n15:45.360 --> 15:46.560\nCan you talk to Siri on it?\n\n15:46.560 --> 15:47.760\nCan we have a conversation with it?\n\n15:47.760 --> 15:48.240\nHey, Siri.\n\n15:48.800 --> 15:49.200\nSiri.\n\n15:50.320 --> 15:51.200\nHey, Siri.\n\n15:52.800 --> 15:53.200\nSiri.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:54.800\nDoes she not do it?\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:56.400\nSiri.\n\n15:57.760 --> 15:59.200\nI talked to your watch, your phone now.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:00.720\nWhat's my phone?\n\n16:01.760 --> 16:02.160\nSiri.\n\n16:02.160 --> 16:06.960\nHey, Siri, help me turn on my watch.\n\n16:08.960 --> 16:10.720\nSiri, can you turn on my watch?\n\n16:12.720 --> 16:15.280\nSurprisingly, that is not within my capability.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.440\nSurprisingly, indeed.\n\n16:26.560 --> 16:30.320\nDan, do you know that you can have Siri refer to you as whatever you want?\n\n16:30.320 --> 16:31.040\nYeah, I do.\n\n16:31.040 --> 16:32.640\nYeah, I do.\n\n16:34.320 --> 16:35.360\nWhat does Siri call you?\n\n16:37.200 --> 16:39.200\nHey, Siri, what do you currently call me?\n\n16:41.200 --> 16:42.240\nI can't answer that.\n\n16:44.480 --> 16:45.040\nNo, it's fine.\n\n16:45.040 --> 16:45.840\nWe're among friends.\n\n16:49.280 --> 16:49.920\nI'm sorry.\n\n16:52.240 --> 16:54.800\nSiri, I would like you to call me by my name.\n\n16:54.800 --> 16:59.360\nFrom now on, I'll call you by my name.\n\n17:05.200 --> 17:05.680\nZiggy.\n\n17:09.920 --> 17:10.720\nGreat.\n\n17:10.720 --> 17:14.880\nSo now we'll never know that that erases what you used to be called.\n\n17:17.520 --> 17:18.960\nAsk her what she used to call you.\n\n17:18.960 --> 17:24.720\nSiri, what did you use to call me?\n\n17:24.720 --> 17:26.320\nThis is about you, not me.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:29.520\nYes, precisely.\n\n17:29.520 --> 17:34.080\nHow do you get her, what's a surefire way to get her to say,\n\n17:34.080 --> 17:36.000\nlike, what's something that she'll always say your name?\n\n17:37.200 --> 17:39.920\nWhat, no, Siri, what's my name?\n\n17:39.920 --> 17:49.920\nYou're Dan, but you asked me to call you master.\n\n17:54.720 --> 17:57.120\nWait, let me see if I can get my hand going to her.\n\n17:57.120 --> 17:57.840\nSure, boy.\n\n18:00.800 --> 18:02.240\nSiri, what's my name?\n\n18:05.040 --> 18:05.680\nOh, no.\n\n18:07.680 --> 18:08.960\nOh, sorry, it wasn't that.\n\n18:08.960 --> 18:09.680\nShe's pouting.\n\n18:12.240 --> 18:13.200\nSiri, what's my name?\n\n18:19.840 --> 18:21.920\nAll right, this has been the technology quarter.\n\n18:24.560 --> 18:25.200\nLet's try it.\n\n18:25.200 --> 18:25.200\nLet's try it.\n\n18:25.200 --> 18:26.240\nWe can edit all this out.\n\n18:26.240 --> 18:27.360\nSiri, I'm sorry.\n\n18:28.320 --> 18:29.280\nSiri, what's my name?\n\n18:31.360 --> 18:34.480\nYou're Jeff, but you asked me to call you ambassador of good times.\n\n18:34.480 --> 18:38.400\nAll right, well, this is very tunneling, huh?\n\n18:38.400 --> 18:40.000\nWe're afraid I don't know a lot about each other.\n\n18:41.440 --> 18:44.880\nSpencer, do you want to have Siri retitle you?\n\n18:44.880 --> 18:45.920\nOh, no, no.\n\n18:45.920 --> 18:48.800\nI have the only thing that I can contribute to this\n\n18:48.800 --> 18:51.200\nis that my good friend, Symphony,\n\n18:51.200 --> 18:53.200\nwhich is a ridiculous name in the first place,\n\n18:54.160 --> 18:58.560\ntold her cell phone to call her Princess Kit Nipples,\n\n18:58.560 --> 19:02.960\nbut it misheard her and thought it was she was saying\n\n19:02.960 --> 19:05.360\nPrincess Spencer Crittenden Nipples.\n\n19:07.200 --> 19:08.800\nSo that's what it calls her.\n\n19:11.920 --> 19:12.720\nI'm changing my.\n\n19:16.480 --> 19:20.800\nSiri, from now on, call me Princess Spencer Crittenden Nipples.\n\n19:20.800 --> 19:21.840\nI don't know if it'll work.\n\n19:23.360 --> 19:26.960\nFrom now on, I'll call you Princess Spencer Crittenden Nipples.\n\n19:26.960 --> 19:27.600\nOh, there you go.\n\n19:29.200 --> 19:29.840\nWonderful.\n\n19:29.840 --> 19:32.720\nSee, aren't you glad you came out through the parade traffic?\n\n19:35.520 --> 19:37.040\nHey, Nathan Bradford isn't here.\n\n19:37.040 --> 19:37.360\nIs he?\n\n19:38.080 --> 19:40.560\nNo, I thought there was this guy on Twitter who was like,\n\n19:41.280 --> 19:43.680\nI couldn't remember if he was coming here tonight.\n\n19:43.680 --> 19:45.280\nI think he's he's he does beats.\n\n19:46.240 --> 19:47.920\nI thought maybe he'd do a little beat boxing\n\n19:47.920 --> 19:48.960\nbecause he does his own beat box.\n\n19:48.960 --> 19:49.520\nBut he's not here.\n\n19:50.960 --> 19:52.880\nWe have a freelance beat boxer right here.\n\n19:53.920 --> 19:57.840\nWell, I beat box too, but maybe a beat box battle.\n\n19:57.840 --> 20:02.880\nOh, I mean, maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe if things get a little slow.\n\n20:04.480 --> 20:04.800\nAll right.\n\n20:05.440 --> 20:09.360\nYou mean we shouldn't do it on the heels of that hot Siri thing that we just did?\n\n20:10.880 --> 20:11.360\nLet's do it.\n\n20:11.360 --> 20:19.120\nLet's do a segment called ask me anything about my mannequin leg at home.\n\n20:22.480 --> 20:24.000\nLet's just do let's just do questions.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:31.680\nYou heard references to me having a mannequin leg at home.\n\n20:32.240 --> 20:38.160\nAnd now's your chance to get to the bottom of it with systematic questions.\n\n20:39.280 --> 20:44.000\nBecause I found out recently answering them makes me feel better about myself.\n\n20:46.560 --> 20:46.960\nAll right.\n\n20:47.920 --> 20:48.240\nAll right.\n\n20:48.240 --> 20:48.960\nWhat do you want to know?\n\n20:49.840 --> 20:50.320\nYes, sir.\n\n20:51.520 --> 20:52.560\nYes, it's just a leg.\n\n20:52.560 --> 20:53.120\nA leg.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:54.640\nHow many?\n\n20:54.640 --> 20:55.680\nJust just one, madam.\n\n20:57.680 --> 21:00.080\nI think you said you've got multiple mannequins.\n\n21:00.080 --> 21:03.280\nI do have multiple mannequins, but this is not a question and answer session about my\n\n21:03.280 --> 21:04.160\nmultiple mannequins.\n\n21:04.800 --> 21:08.320\nI'm not I'm not offended by questions about my multiple mannequins, but I have recently\n\n21:08.320 --> 21:14.880\nbought two full mannequins, one one that lays supine and propped up on its elbows.\n\n21:15.360 --> 21:21.280\nLike it's like reading a book and then one that's like on its knees with its hands on\n\n21:21.280 --> 21:22.560\nhips and its head back.\n\n21:25.040 --> 21:26.720\nI'm assuming that's for like summer wear.\n\n21:29.040 --> 21:30.320\nThey're only like a hundred bucks.\n\n21:30.320 --> 21:31.600\nAnd I got a couple.\n\n21:31.600 --> 21:35.760\nThey don't really they don't really work for what for your for your knees.\n\n21:35.760 --> 21:39.200\nI thought I thought I thought I thought if I thought I could dress them up and like rub\n\n21:39.200 --> 21:41.520\non them or something like funnel them.\n\n21:41.520 --> 21:44.000\nLike I like fully clothed women with agency.\n\n21:45.920 --> 21:49.520\nSo a mannequin would be right out then that would that would what what do you mean right\n\n21:49.520 --> 21:50.960\nout because they don't come fully clothed.\n\n21:50.960 --> 21:53.120\nNo, no mannequins don't have agency.\n\n21:53.600 --> 21:55.760\nOh, well, they I pretend they do.\n\n21:55.760 --> 21:57.440\nI project it out of them.\n\n21:57.440 --> 21:57.760\nOkay.\n\n21:57.760 --> 21:59.840\nLike the way I dress them implies agency.\n\n21:59.840 --> 22:00.960\nLike they're fancy.\n\n22:00.960 --> 22:01.200\nOkay.\n\n22:02.080 --> 22:03.360\nAnd I'm just a shlub.\n\n22:03.360 --> 22:05.440\nBut you're saying that it's not getting the job done for you.\n\n22:05.440 --> 22:08.560\nWell, it's just like a big, you know, it's like a stiff thing.\n\n22:08.560 --> 22:11.280\nAnd you know, you know, I already did the real doll thing.\n\n22:11.280 --> 22:13.680\nAnd I just I can't go down that road again.\n\n22:13.680 --> 22:15.280\nThis is so sad when they die.\n\n22:15.280 --> 22:26.160\nLike this is like I also just this big crate, you know, and the guys that deliver the crate\n\n22:26.160 --> 22:27.120\nare so bummed out.\n\n22:27.920 --> 22:30.800\nAnd you just want to tell them what's in there just to make their day, but you can't.\n\n22:30.800 --> 22:33.680\nSo they assume it's like just barbells or something.\n\n22:33.680 --> 22:37.200\nMaybe they know, you know, but at any rate, they're going to take it up the stairs.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.640\nSo you only had the one real doll back in the old days, right?\n\n22:40.640 --> 22:40.960\nRight.\n\n22:40.960 --> 22:42.800\nYou haven't got a second one yet.\n\n22:42.800 --> 22:43.280\nNo.\n\n22:43.280 --> 22:44.320\nSo here's the thing.\n\n22:44.320 --> 22:47.760\nAll right. So the one the mannequin leg, though, the one that I've had forever.\n\n22:47.760 --> 22:49.280\nIt's this plastic.\n\n22:49.280 --> 22:50.080\nI should have brought it.\n\n22:53.680 --> 22:56.240\nBut then you'd be like, he's that's a thing that you've come on.\n\n22:58.240 --> 22:59.920\nYes, it's a it's a plastic.\n\n22:59.920 --> 23:02.800\nIt's specifically designed for the display of hosiery.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.800\nBut it's like it's not so you don't even see him anymore.\n\n23:06.800 --> 23:10.560\nI found I tracked this down at a warehouse like 15 years ago.\n\n23:10.560 --> 23:14.160\nAnd there were two of them originally, madam, an answer to your question.\n\n23:15.440 --> 23:17.040\nBack in the old department, back in Hollywood.\n\n23:18.080 --> 23:23.680\nYes, I was back in the apartment in Hollywood and I found two like like like like plastic,\n\n23:23.680 --> 23:28.080\nhollow, like life size, woman's legs.\n\n23:28.080 --> 23:31.040\nDoes one's fully extended and the other's bent.\n\n23:31.760 --> 23:34.000\nAnd then you you're supposed to have a store.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:39.120\nI don't.\n\n23:40.400 --> 23:43.040\nAnd then you're supposed to put like hosiery on him and say, look,\n\n23:43.040 --> 23:45.520\nwe look at this hosiery would look on your leg.\n\n23:45.520 --> 23:50.320\nAnd and then I just but I went out to this warehouse and I like bottom.\n\n23:50.320 --> 23:51.600\nAnd I was like, I want these.\n\n23:51.600 --> 23:52.960\nAnd they're like, OK.\n\n23:53.840 --> 23:56.160\nAnd I was like, it's for an exhibit.\n\n23:56.160 --> 23:57.680\nAnd they're like, we didn't ask.\n\n23:57.680 --> 24:05.520\nAnd I just I like I put I put Haynes silk reflections.\n\n24:07.520 --> 24:08.480\nPanty house.\n\n24:08.480 --> 24:09.520\nWe have a hand up over here.\n\n24:09.520 --> 24:10.080\nOK, sorry.\n\n24:10.080 --> 24:10.640\nGo ahead, ma'am.\n\n24:10.640 --> 24:10.880\nYes.\n\n24:14.480 --> 24:16.720\nNo, the question was, did I paint their toenails?\n\n24:16.720 --> 24:18.080\nNo, I did not.\n\n24:18.080 --> 24:18.880\nInteresting.\n\n24:18.880 --> 24:19.280\nYes, sir.\n\n24:19.280 --> 24:30.880\nSir, this is a guy who wants to know real practical information about this.\n\n24:30.880 --> 24:33.120\nHe wants to know when I put the pantyhose on him,\n\n24:33.120 --> 24:35.840\nwhat's the lifespan before they have to be replaced?\n\n24:35.840 --> 24:39.920\nHow many uses is he knows like how easily they get a run in them and right.\n\n24:41.280 --> 24:44.000\nOr he wants to know, do I instantly come on them all the time?\n\n24:44.800 --> 24:45.600\nAnd no, I don't.\n\n24:46.560 --> 24:48.800\nI kind of I kind of do that as a little treat.\n\n24:48.800 --> 24:49.520\nLike, like, like.\n\n24:53.360 --> 24:55.120\nLike I treat to whom?\n\n24:56.400 --> 24:56.960\nTo me.\n\n24:56.960 --> 24:57.520\nOK, all right.\n\n24:59.520 --> 25:04.960\nTypically, sir, I would say the average pair of hosiery that I would put on.\n\n25:04.960 --> 25:05.840\nOh, by the way, I'm down.\n\n25:05.840 --> 25:07.840\nI'd lost the fully extended one.\n\n25:07.840 --> 25:09.840\nJust go through like eight different relationships.\n\n25:09.840 --> 25:12.160\nAnd each one, the girlfriend says, what are these?\n\n25:12.160 --> 25:17.280\nAnd then like over over time, they just sort of like like tiles on the space shuttle.\n\n25:17.280 --> 25:19.680\nYou're kind of like, it's amazing that I still have this.\n\n25:19.680 --> 25:21.920\nLike I have the one that takes up less space.\n\n25:21.920 --> 25:24.720\nSo it's like it's like the bent one, which is not the cooler one.\n\n25:26.080 --> 25:27.680\nI really liked having both of them.\n\n25:27.680 --> 25:29.440\nThat mannequin existed before Aaron.\n\n25:30.160 --> 25:31.360\nBut that was around you.\n\n25:31.360 --> 25:32.800\nOh, yeah, a million years ago.\n\n25:32.800 --> 25:35.360\nAnd that that was hidden around your place during the thing?\n\n25:35.360 --> 25:36.080\nWell, not hidden.\n\n25:36.080 --> 25:38.160\nI've never I'm not a dishonest man.\n\n25:38.160 --> 25:42.400\nAnd so if you move in with me, you find this thing and you go, what's going on?\n\n25:42.400 --> 25:46.400\nHey, jeez, you guys, I mean, what in the world here?\n\n25:46.400 --> 25:49.840\nThey're so enthralled with the show, but they just want to talk about it.\n\n25:49.840 --> 25:50.880\nLike, what are you doing?\n\n25:50.880 --> 25:56.800\nI think there's just a kind of a room before the thing came up.\n\n25:56.800 --> 25:58.320\nThey're just no, they're they're bad people.\n\n26:00.080 --> 26:01.440\nWho's being bad people right now, right?\n\n26:01.440 --> 26:02.240\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n26:02.240 --> 26:05.440\nAll right, I'll fucking sort them right out.\n\n26:07.600 --> 26:11.360\nThe I think I'm assuming the conversation is like, why does he why does he keep talking?\n\n26:11.360 --> 26:12.480\nWhen's the show going to start?\n\n26:16.720 --> 26:18.720\nI know there's a community around community.\n\n26:20.240 --> 26:21.040\nI don't know what to do.\n\n26:21.040 --> 26:22.320\nCome on, I don't want to.\n\n26:22.320 --> 26:23.760\nWell, because you want to.\n\n26:25.360 --> 26:25.920\nI know you.\n\n26:25.920 --> 26:28.320\nSo I just know you got $10.\n\n26:30.080 --> 26:33.040\nI think it's probably more like honey, tell them about your mannequin.\n\n26:33.040 --> 26:33.680\nI think it's like that.\n\n26:35.360 --> 26:36.320\nAnyways, all right.\n\n26:36.320 --> 26:36.640\nOkay.\n\n26:36.640 --> 26:39.520\nSo you got that you got the old school man.\n\n26:39.520 --> 26:41.440\nYou bought new mannequins recently or no?\n\n26:41.440 --> 26:43.600\nLike I suppose I bought new mannequins recently.\n\n26:43.600 --> 26:48.800\nBut the the the old yellow, the old the old stalled faithful.\n\n26:49.760 --> 26:51.680\nThe one that the only thing that really works.\n\n26:52.320 --> 26:53.040\nWhy is it yellow?\n\n26:55.840 --> 26:57.360\nWhy do you call it that then?\n\n26:57.360 --> 26:58.160\nIt's not yellow.\n\n26:58.160 --> 26:59.120\nOh, sir.\n\n26:59.120 --> 27:00.560\nI think the answer is like, I don't know.\n\n27:00.560 --> 27:01.280\nLet's see.\n\n27:01.280 --> 27:03.840\nLet's say let's let's say we let's say a week and a half.\n\n27:03.840 --> 27:04.240\nI don't know.\n\n27:04.240 --> 27:04.560\nOkay.\n\n27:06.240 --> 27:07.440\nWell, yeah, because here's what I do.\n\n27:07.440 --> 27:09.120\nBecause here's the question you're not answering.\n\n27:09.120 --> 27:10.240\nWhat do you do?\n\n27:10.240 --> 27:12.080\nI rub rub the toe on my nipple.\n\n27:15.440 --> 27:16.640\nAnd then jerk off with the other hand.\n\n27:16.640 --> 27:18.480\nEvery time without variation.\n\n27:18.480 --> 27:18.880\nThank you.\n\n27:18.880 --> 27:19.360\nEvery time.\n\n27:21.360 --> 27:22.000\nEvery every time.\n\n27:23.360 --> 27:23.920\nThank you.\n\n27:23.920 --> 27:24.480\nThank you.\n\n27:24.480 --> 27:24.880\nThank you.\n\n27:26.080 --> 27:26.480\nThank you.\n\n27:28.640 --> 27:29.040\nThank you.\n\n27:32.800 --> 27:34.320\nI rub the toe on my nipple.\n\n27:36.880 --> 27:37.520\nAnd then I come.\n\n27:37.520 --> 27:41.200\nAnd then every week and a half I come on the leg.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:45.760\nBecause I'm like, I think a part of me is like,\n\n27:45.760 --> 27:46.880\nwhy are you doing this?\n\n27:46.880 --> 27:47.360\nStop it.\n\n27:47.920 --> 27:51.440\nBut is that 100% of the time that's always what happens?\n\n27:51.440 --> 27:52.400\nOr do you shake it up?\n\n27:52.400 --> 27:53.360\nIs there other things?\n\n27:53.360 --> 27:54.640\nNo, one time.\n\n27:55.840 --> 27:56.480\nYou put a sharpie in the ass.\n\n27:56.480 --> 27:57.760\nA swat team came in the window.\n\n27:57.760 --> 27:58.400\nWhat?\n\n27:58.400 --> 28:04.320\nNo, I'm saying is it every time you masturbate that the toe and the nipple are happening?\n\n28:04.320 --> 28:06.800\nOr you're saying if the mannequin leg is involved,\n\n28:06.800 --> 28:08.880\nthere is a nipple toe rub happening?\n\n28:08.880 --> 28:11.440\nWell, I don't understand the difference between those two scenarios.\n\n28:11.440 --> 28:14.640\nMy question is, it every, no, okay.\n\n28:14.640 --> 28:16.240\nLet's say you masturbate a hundred times.\n\n28:16.800 --> 28:17.360\nAnd I do.\n\n28:19.360 --> 28:21.920\nA hundred of those are mannequin legs with toe rub?\n\n28:21.920 --> 28:23.280\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n28:23.280 --> 28:24.320\nGod, no, no.\n\n28:24.320 --> 28:24.640\nOkay.\n\n28:24.640 --> 28:24.960\nI know.\n\n28:24.960 --> 28:26.080\nAnd now I understand what you're asking.\n\n28:26.080 --> 28:28.000\nNo, this is like when you go jogging,\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:35.440\ndo you always put the sports band on your arm and with the apple shuffle and the special hat?\n\n28:35.440 --> 28:40.000\nI don't know how you jog.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.840\nI want to know more about your special hat.\n\n28:43.280 --> 28:46.640\nAnd this is like, this is like, you know, no, I believe me.\n\n28:46.640 --> 28:47.760\nI can rub one out.\n\n28:47.760 --> 28:49.520\nLike, it's just, just nothing.\n\n28:49.520 --> 28:51.040\nIt's just with my mind alone.\n\n28:51.040 --> 28:56.640\nSo this is, when you get into a certain mood, you go, oh, now's the time to take out the mannequin,\n\n28:56.640 --> 28:58.800\nput some Mahane's reflective.\n\n28:58.800 --> 29:01.040\nYeah, you get a little hankering.\n\n29:01.040 --> 29:01.600\nYeah, yeah.\n\n29:01.600 --> 29:03.280\nLike, I'm going to treat myself today.\n\n29:03.280 --> 29:08.080\nBut when that happens and when it's the mannequin leg and the hosiery,\n\n29:08.720 --> 29:11.280\nand you're rubbing the toe of the mannequin leg on your nipple and you're,\n\n29:12.160 --> 29:15.360\nas you discussed earlier, kneeling down, right?\n\n29:15.360 --> 29:16.080\nYeah, I'm a kneeler.\n\n29:16.080 --> 29:16.320\nOkay.\n\n29:17.760 --> 29:19.440\nIs that, is that solid gold?\n\n29:19.440 --> 29:20.320\nDoes it work every time?\n\n29:20.320 --> 29:22.000\nOr sometimes you go, oh, fuck, I'm not feeling it today.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:22.720\nIt's not, it's not working.\n\n29:22.720 --> 29:24.000\nIt's, I didn't, uh.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:25.200\nAnd then you start yelling at the leg.\n\n29:28.240 --> 29:29.680\nLike elsewhere engine in Deadwood.\n\n29:30.800 --> 29:31.680\nWhat's wrong with you?\n\n29:31.680 --> 29:35.440\nUh, no, it, it pretty much, it really works.\n\n29:35.440 --> 29:38.080\nI mean, it's not like a button that makes it happen automatic.\n\n29:38.080 --> 29:40.240\nI just like, at this point, it's probably kind of habit.\n\n29:41.440 --> 29:43.680\nYou know, I'm not even sure.\n\n29:44.960 --> 29:46.960\nI guess it feels, I should paint the toenail.\n\n29:46.960 --> 29:50.320\nBut you know, like, it's been suggested by the bad person.\n\n29:50.320 --> 29:51.200\nWhat are the bad people?\n\n29:53.520 --> 29:55.200\nAll right, I'm glad you're invested though.\n\n29:55.200 --> 29:55.600\nThat's good.\n\n29:56.240 --> 29:58.720\nI feel like they were invested to the point where they were murmuring,\n\n29:58.720 --> 30:00.720\nlike they were having a sidebar about what you're talking about.\n\n30:00.720 --> 30:02.880\nWell, obviously I'm a little vulnerable up here.\n\n30:02.880 --> 30:04.800\nSo if I hear people talking while I'm talking,\n\n30:04.800 --> 30:07.280\nthen I'm going to be like, well, this, if this can't interest you,\n\n30:07.280 --> 30:10.800\nwhat, my God, it's, it's, I'm like, well, what can I,\n\n30:10.800 --> 30:11.680\nwhat else can I do?\n\n30:11.680 --> 30:14.240\nIt's like, it's, it's, it's, it's like if as they drove the,\n\n30:14.240 --> 30:18.800\nthe last nail in Jesus, yeah, I'll make the analogy.\n\n30:21.760 --> 30:24.800\nIt's, it's, it's as if like, like, like, like the last nail went in.\n\n30:24.800 --> 30:29.760\nAnd then, and then, and then they're like, oh, your hand is, uh, uh,\n\n30:29.760 --> 30:32.000\nso easily nailed through, you suck.\n\n30:33.200 --> 30:37.040\nAnd he'd be like, come on, I've done enough.\n\n30:38.480 --> 30:39.120\nIt hurts.\n\n30:39.840 --> 30:40.960\nI think it's a fair analogy.\n\n30:43.840 --> 30:44.640\nSorry, say what?\n\n30:44.640 --> 30:46.800\nDo they have shoes or can they get away?\n\n30:50.160 --> 30:51.520\nWait, they can't get away.\n\n30:51.520 --> 30:55.520\nThey're, they're inanimate, but, uh, I have tried putting shoes on them,\n\n30:55.520 --> 30:59.200\nbut the, but the foot is like, it's too, you try,\n\n30:59.200 --> 31:02.560\nI try, I've tried to like get shoes and like put them on to see if\n\n31:02.560 --> 31:04.800\nthat would like maybe get me a little jazzed or something.\n\n31:05.760 --> 31:07.040\nBecause then I get like, take the shoe off.\n\n31:07.040 --> 31:09.440\nWait, wait, wait, the guy that said that is your angle that like,\n\n31:10.400 --> 31:12.320\nyou're putting high heels on so they can't get away.\n\n31:12.320 --> 31:14.320\nBut like, what if he put like running shoes on them?\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.080\nThe finger angle was, huh?\n\n31:18.080 --> 31:19.840\nI think, sporty, right?\n\n31:19.840 --> 31:20.000\nYeah.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.320\nSo I, yeah, I don't, I'm not into high heels, by the way.\n\n31:22.320 --> 31:23.680\nNo, I think we discussed that.\n\n31:24.560 --> 31:25.600\nYeah, I don't get that.\n\n31:25.600 --> 31:26.800\nI don't understand the high heels.\n\n31:26.800 --> 31:29.360\nThey're so high.\n\n31:29.360 --> 31:30.640\nBut you, what are you saying?\n\n31:30.640 --> 31:32.400\nYou're, what are you, you're just being glib.\n\n31:32.400 --> 31:33.600\nWell, I mean, I'm being literal.\n\n31:33.600 --> 31:34.800\nYour table is so small.\n\n31:34.800 --> 31:38.560\nI know, I feel so vulnerable on my right flank right now.\n\n31:38.560 --> 31:41.440\nIt's, it's a real strategic nightmare.\n\n31:42.880 --> 31:45.680\nI mean, I understand that the, the, I guess, you know, the.\n\n31:45.680 --> 31:46.800\nRepel borders.\n\n31:46.800 --> 31:49.760\nI guess the idea is that your heels, you're always on your tip toes.\n\n31:49.760 --> 31:51.920\nAnd when you're on your tip toes, I guess your butt looks better.\n\n31:51.920 --> 31:54.480\nI don't, I don't, I don't, I don't get it.\n\n31:54.480 --> 31:56.960\nLike, but we heard a guy yell out, he doesn't like high heels in there.\n\n31:56.960 --> 32:00.240\nGuy, guys, or gals, who doesn't like high heels by applause?\n\n32:01.600 --> 32:02.400\nThey don't like them.\n\n32:02.400 --> 32:03.280\nThose are the people that don't.\n\n32:03.280 --> 32:03.840\nWell girls don't.\n\n32:03.840 --> 32:04.480\nThey don't like them.\n\n32:04.480 --> 32:04.800\nYeah.\n\n32:04.800 --> 32:05.840\nWho, who is it?\n\n32:05.840 --> 32:06.160\nAll right.\n\n32:06.160 --> 32:09.040\nA plot, if you're like a big, if it really trips your trigger, the high heel thing.\n\n32:11.840 --> 32:13.520\nBut that's probably, we should probably double that.\n\n32:13.520 --> 32:16.000\nCause some people just don't want to, they don't want to like cheer\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:17.840\nbecause you feel like you're in a Bud Light commercial.\n\n32:19.280 --> 32:21.040\nI would go, I'm going to double that applause.\n\n32:21.040 --> 32:21.840\nWho's in, who's in the butt?\n\n32:21.840 --> 32:25.520\nBased on Bud Light commercials.\n\n32:25.520 --> 32:27.520\nMore people in the butt plugs and high heels.\n\n32:29.200 --> 32:29.600\nYou know what?\n\n32:29.600 --> 32:32.080\nYou, you can, you could, you could combine those two.\n\n32:33.920 --> 32:34.320\nAll right.\n\n32:34.320 --> 32:36.080\nSo, so I've opened up a little bit.\n\n32:36.080 --> 32:40.320\nSo I thought since it's Thanksgiving, like who, who here is coming off of like a really\n\n32:40.320 --> 32:43.840\nparticularly awkward Thanksgiving for any particular reason?\n\n32:43.840 --> 32:44.080\nAll right.\n\n32:44.080 --> 32:45.840\nThat hand shot up in the, in he mood.\n\n32:48.640 --> 32:51.440\nDo you want to come up here and share your, your, your bad\n\n32:51.440 --> 32:52.960\nThanksgiving or awkward Thanksgiving?\n\n32:52.960 --> 32:54.320\nAwkward goat mover.\n\n32:54.320 --> 32:54.880\nHere we come.\n\n32:54.880 --> 32:55.760\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n32:57.280 --> 32:58.160\nWhat's your name?\n\n32:58.160 --> 32:59.040\nI'm Gage.\n\n32:59.040 --> 32:59.520\nGage.\n\n33:01.200 --> 33:02.080\nGage, everybody.\n\n33:03.360 --> 33:05.200\nGage, do me a favor.\n\n33:05.200 --> 33:06.640\nFace, turn your butt toward the cameras.\n\n33:06.640 --> 33:09.360\nAnd let's talk about what the terrible catastrophe that happened to your pockets.\n\n33:11.200 --> 33:12.080\nIs this by design?\n\n33:12.080 --> 33:14.160\nHe was chased here by Coyote.\n\n33:15.440 --> 33:16.400\nAnd he just made it.\n\n33:16.400 --> 33:19.440\nHaven't you learned Spencer's way to fend off wolves from all angles?\n\n33:19.440 --> 33:20.800\nI'm getting a little bit better at it.\n\n33:20.800 --> 33:21.280\nAll right.\n\n33:21.280 --> 33:25.120\nI happened to buy these pants like right before I went out to Joshua tree and ended\n\n33:25.120 --> 33:26.880\nup like sliding down a bunch of rocks.\n\n33:26.880 --> 33:27.120\nOkay.\n\n33:27.120 --> 33:30.080\nSo I'm happily hearing that you did not buy these that way.\n\n33:30.080 --> 33:32.720\nThese actually, no, no, no, no, this is real wear and tear.\n\n33:32.720 --> 33:36.640\nThis is real wear and tear like the day of purchase too.\n\n33:36.640 --> 33:37.120\nReally?\n\n33:37.120 --> 33:37.200\nYeah.\n\n33:37.200 --> 33:38.080\nSo you was a Joshua tree.\n\n33:38.080 --> 33:40.080\nWere you doing drugs and things out there in the desert?\n\n33:40.080 --> 33:40.480\nOh yeah.\n\n33:40.480 --> 33:41.520\nWould you do acid?\n\n33:41.520 --> 33:42.320\nA little bit of LSD.\n\n33:42.320 --> 33:42.640\nYeah.\n\n33:42.640 --> 33:43.040\nOh yeah.\n\n33:43.040 --> 33:43.360\nHow'd it go?\n\n33:43.920 --> 33:44.560\nFantastic.\n\n33:44.560 --> 33:44.800\nYeah.\n\n33:45.440 --> 33:48.480\nSo you, you just are sliding down those, those groovy rocks and you just,\n\n33:49.600 --> 33:51.120\nit's hard to destroy denim.\n\n33:51.120 --> 33:52.560\nYou have to really do a lot of butt sliding.\n\n33:52.560 --> 33:53.920\nYou got to do a real number on them.\n\n33:54.560 --> 33:55.120\nAnd you did.\n\n33:55.120 --> 33:55.520\nYeah.\n\n33:55.520 --> 33:55.840\nAll right.\n\n33:55.840 --> 33:57.040\nWell, that's why we love you, Gage.\n\n33:57.600 --> 34:00.720\nI didn't, I did mushrooms up there in that, their desert.\n\n34:00.720 --> 34:05.600\nAnd it's just terrified the whole time that, that my girlfriend was going to die because\n\n34:05.600 --> 34:07.600\nshe was running around like a goddamn maniac.\n\n34:08.720 --> 34:09.440\nLook at the rocks.\n\n34:09.440 --> 34:10.320\nThey're alive.\n\n34:10.320 --> 34:12.720\nI'm like, motherfucker, you're alive.\n\n34:15.040 --> 34:16.080\nAnd I'm freaking out.\n\n34:17.280 --> 34:18.480\nThe snake's out here.\n\n34:18.480 --> 34:24.080\nBitch. Every, every time I do mushrooms is like the gravity gets turned up to 11.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:26.640\nLSD is a good adventure.\n\n34:26.640 --> 34:30.400\nI could just picture, I mean, it's just like so, like, I just, like, it's the injury thing.\n\n34:30.400 --> 34:34.160\nLike I just, I can't, I just, I can just so easily picture.\n\n34:34.160 --> 34:36.480\nAnd for some reason, this isn't intentional.\n\n34:36.480 --> 34:40.240\nI never, I don't think I've ever been attracted to a, I've never ended up in a\n\n34:40.240 --> 34:45.200\nrelationship with a, with a, with a, I have to try, I don't want to insult anybody that I've\n\n34:45.200 --> 34:50.400\nbeen in a relationship with, but I, they're typically very clumsy women.\n\n34:51.440 --> 34:54.080\nLike they're very, very charming and funny and smart.\n\n34:54.080 --> 34:58.000\nAnd then like, like, like, like almost always to just like, like extra, like, and I just,\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:02.000\nlike, I've spent my relationship terrified that they're going to, I mean, Aaron, like I,\n\n35:02.880 --> 35:06.640\nwe've talked about this, like she was just always like, like making shit and then leaning\n\n35:06.640 --> 35:07.760\nout windows and hanging it.\n\n35:07.760 --> 35:10.160\nAnd then she'd go like, oh, I fell out the window while you were gone.\n\n35:10.160 --> 35:15.040\nAnd like, I just like, just like, I just, oh, I just like, because I know what I just\n\n35:15.040 --> 35:19.440\ndon't feel like I'm going to have the, the, the capacity to deal with an injury.\n\n35:19.440 --> 35:23.520\nI had to physically restrain my girl from this weekend from crawling inside a dumpster with\n\n35:23.520 --> 35:24.560\na family of raccoons.\n\n35:26.720 --> 35:30.240\nWe were, she was crawling in a dumpster that already had a family of raccoons in it,\n\n35:30.240 --> 35:32.480\nor she had ganged up with a family of raccoons.\n\n35:33.200 --> 35:35.840\nAnd she was like, let's, let's go storm that.\n\n35:35.840 --> 35:39.200\nNo, you should have stopped her from joining a family of raccoons.\n\n35:40.080 --> 35:41.760\nShe hadn't yet curried their favor.\n\n35:41.760 --> 35:42.560\nThat was my problem.\n\n35:42.560 --> 35:45.120\nShe was, it was like an initiation.\n\n35:45.120 --> 35:49.920\nShe was getting jumped in by the, by the, by the, by the Palm Springs.\n\n35:51.600 --> 35:54.560\nDid she heed your warning or did she go, did she go right ahead?\n\n35:54.560 --> 35:57.120\nNo, that's why I had to physically restrain her.\n\n35:57.120 --> 35:59.920\nNo, so we were, we were up in Big Bear for the week.\n\n36:00.560 --> 36:06.320\nWe took a week off and just went up and we also happened to have taken a little bit of\n\n36:06.320 --> 36:12.160\nLSD and we're just hanging out and we, we went down to our car to get something.\n\n36:12.160 --> 36:19.200\nAnd we, we heard this like ruckus from inside this big metal cage of dumpsters.\n\n36:19.200 --> 36:21.200\nAnd she's like, I think there's a bunch of rats right there.\n\n36:21.200 --> 36:25.200\nI'm like, no, we got eight angry raccoons staring right at us.\n\n36:25.200 --> 36:30.480\nAnd she just crawls down to her knees and starts inching her way towards them\n\n36:30.480 --> 36:32.960\nas they're like angrily bearing her down.\n\n36:34.160 --> 36:39.600\nI'm like, babe, I know you think that you're about to be accepted by a family of raccoons,\n\n36:39.600 --> 36:44.640\nbut it's four AM and this is about to become everybody else's problem.\n\n36:44.640 --> 36:46.240\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n36:46.240 --> 36:47.920\nThat's the thing about injuries.\n\n36:47.920 --> 36:50.560\nYeah, if you get all fucked up, you fall off a rock and hit your head,\n\n36:50.560 --> 36:53.040\nthen you get to spend the rest of the night, uh, like,\n\n36:53.040 --> 36:54.240\nnot before you know it.\n\n36:54.240 --> 36:57.200\nAnd everyone's like, well, how do I festering raccoons?\n\n36:57.200 --> 36:58.240\nDo you put a tourniquet on a head?\n\n37:00.240 --> 37:04.720\nShe, she's so beautifully, uh, naive.\n\n37:04.720 --> 37:08.160\nThe world that she lives in is one where she could instantly become friends\n\n37:08.160 --> 37:10.000\nwith a family of angry raccoons.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.720\nWell, raccoons are deceptively adorable.\n\n37:12.720 --> 37:17.280\nLike they, they, they look, they look adorable, but they, like, they, they,\n\n37:17.280 --> 37:22.720\nthey, if you go near them, they, yeah, they cock their head at you and go, stop.\n\n37:22.720 --> 37:23.200\nYeah.\n\n37:23.200 --> 37:26.800\nLike they don't have any, they eventually get bored and walk away.\n\n37:26.800 --> 37:27.760\nLike they size you up.\n\n37:27.760 --> 37:31.440\nAre there any accounts, are there any accounts of people being mauled or attacked by raccoons?\n\n37:31.440 --> 37:35.200\nWell, dogs, like, like, that's why we, yeah, because like, like, we had a raccoon coming\n\n37:35.200 --> 37:39.600\nin our doggy door and, uh, at home and, uh, and then Aaron went online and like,\n\n37:39.600 --> 37:45.200\nif you type dog raccoon, it's just fucking photo rolls of pictures of, you know,\n\n37:45.200 --> 37:49.280\njust cause they got, they got, like, they're like monks in D&D.\n\n37:49.280 --> 37:51.440\nThey got little, they got little, they got little people hands.\n\n37:51.440 --> 37:51.680\nYeah.\n\n37:51.680 --> 37:53.440\nThey got little, they got little human.\n\n37:53.440 --> 37:54.480\nAnd they're not little people.\n\n37:54.480 --> 37:56.400\nYou know what else has a little people hands that aren't people?\n\n37:56.400 --> 37:57.840\nchimpanzees and look what they do.\n\n37:58.640 --> 37:59.760\nThey get

a, like, the same group of eight raccoons\n\n38:09.120 --> 38:16.240\nwere literally beating the shit out of each other outside of our door and making an insane.\n\n38:16.240 --> 38:17.280\nYou think it was infighting?\n\n38:17.280 --> 38:20.720\nIt was like, Hey, Jerry, uh, that woman wanted to join our group.\n\n38:22.080 --> 38:23.440\nYou fucking fleshed up on her.\n\n38:25.280 --> 38:25.760\nAll right.\n\n38:25.760 --> 38:29.280\nSo Thanksgiving, uh, where, where, where, where did you spend it?\n\n38:29.280 --> 38:31.440\nUh, I did, I did two separate ones.\n\n38:31.440 --> 38:34.560\nI did one with my girlfriend's family and then one with my family.\n\n38:34.560 --> 38:38.800\nYour girlfriend is played by Reese Witherspoon and your Vince Vaughn.\n\n38:40.240 --> 38:40.560\nAll right.\n\n38:40.560 --> 38:41.280\nFor purposes of.\n\n38:41.280 --> 38:42.560\nI was going to go Joaquin Phoenix.\n\n38:43.360 --> 38:46.160\nI was, it's a, I'm, I should not talk.\n\n38:47.600 --> 38:48.000\nOkay.\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:49.440\nSo proceed.\n\n38:49.440 --> 38:54.240\nUh, it was an, it was, it was overall a pretty great Thanksgiving.\n\n38:54.960 --> 38:55.920\nBut, uh, what?\n\n38:55.920 --> 38:56.560\nGet out of here.\n\n38:56.560 --> 38:58.880\nYou're all, uh, dare you.\n\n38:58.880 --> 39:03.440\nUh, she, uh, she was a little taken aback.\n\n39:04.560 --> 39:10.880\nMy parents have gone through a little bit of like a, uh, sexual renaissance since I've left\n\n39:10.880 --> 39:16.160\nthe house and have started hanging out with a lot of very, uh, swingy type people.\n\n39:17.600 --> 39:25.440\nAnd, uh, the whole Thanksgiving was, uh, was, I think pushing her boundaries a little bit.\n\n39:25.440 --> 39:26.800\nHmm.\n\n39:27.760 --> 39:27.920\nWait.\n\n39:27.920 --> 39:32.320\nSo your parents were like, like actively flirting with other couples during Thanksgiving?\n\n39:33.600 --> 39:33.920\nYeah.\n\n39:35.760 --> 39:36.640\nThat's pretty active.\n\n39:36.640 --> 39:39.280\nSo there's swingy, the swingy couples were there as well.\n\n39:39.280 --> 39:41.360\nLike, like breaking the wishbones with them.\n\n39:42.240 --> 39:44.880\nThere's a lot of ass grabbing and crotch fondling.\n\n39:44.880 --> 39:45.280\nReally?\n\n39:45.280 --> 39:45.760\nYeah.\n\n39:45.760 -->

Okay, so let us have it both barrels\n\n42:17.860 --> 42:22.260\nWell, I just moved to Los Angeles from all the way in New York\n\n42:22.260 --> 42:28.380\nAnd I'm staying with a friend's family and I just didn't know a single person. It was just like, yeah\n\n42:28.380 --> 42:33.580\nI'm just this 20-something dude who's eating all your turkey and drinking all of your beer and\n\n42:34.220 --> 42:36.540\nJust being that's fun though. I did that\n\n42:37.460 --> 42:39.460\nI like being the interloper\n\n42:39.740 --> 42:43.460\nIt definitely had its benefits because I didn't have to talk to anyone\n\n42:43.460 --> 42:47.700\nBut also you're constantly grateful which is what you're supposed to be for Thanksgiving\n\n42:47.700 --> 42:50.180\nAnd it's like it's a huge challenge to me in a normal Thanksgiving\n\n42:50.180 --> 42:53.220\nYou're like when you're with your family and you're like, uh, I don't know\n\n42:55.220 --> 42:57.220\nI'm not dead yet, I guess\n\n42:57.940 --> 43:04.140\nBut but then you like someone welcomes you in your in their home and you're like really I can have bread Wow\n\n43:04.660 --> 43:07.340\nThat's true. That's true. They were incredibly nice, but\n\n43:07.980 --> 43:13.420\nIt's just like I didn't have any I didn't know if I had any common ground with them because it was just like\n\n43:13.420 --> 43:19.260\nWhat am I gonna talk about can't talk about politics? That's always that's always at family gatherings\n\n43:19.260 --> 43:25.940\nYeah, especially when there's an openly fascist presidential candidate in the in the lead\n\n43:28.660 --> 43:33.220\nReligion that always works. Yeah. Yeah, well, so I mean, what's are you saying?\n\n43:33.220 --> 43:40.940\nAre you do you have a little a little example taste because so far gauge is got a cooler name and\n\n43:42.180 --> 43:44.180\nLike\n\n43:44.180 --> 43:52.300\nAge I kind of wish I was named paperback. Yeah, so so far gauges in the lead because his parents were fondling other other people\n\n43:52.460 --> 43:59.020\nRight, that's also that's also hard to follow. That's also hard to follow. I just had kind of entry-level entry-level awkwardness\n\n44:00.260 --> 44:04.660\nPeppered with oh my god, it's not snowing. Thank you. Thank you\n\n44:05.220 --> 44:11.300\nAll right. All right.

I was gonna say we have a gender balance now\n\n44:28.660 --> 44:32.220\nBut now 40% of the time you say oh, we have a gender balance and then you go hi\n\n44:32.220 --> 44:36.540\nMy name is Mike and I like like like like now. I'm offended and you're micro-aggressing me and\n\n44:36.540 --> 44:41.060\nThe but but what's your name? My name is Heather. Heather. Okay. Thank you Heather\n\n44:41.060 --> 44:43.260\nWhat's that?

Wow. Oh, what was going on here?\n\n45:33.580 --> 45:36.540\nJust why wasn't I invited to this?\n\n45:36.540 --> 45:41.860\nI don't know well, but um, but the more demolish was not to like, you know, sorry\n\n45:41.860 --> 45:44.820\nBut we don't know but was that wasn't a real there was a dinner here\n\n45:44.820 --> 45:50.020\nNo, we ordered Thai food so like today when I ordered pick up like somebody was like, oh, how was your Thanksgiving?\n\n45:50.020 --> 45:52.460\nI was like, oh, it was great. Oh, did you have turkey and all that?\n\n45:53.020 --> 45:58.100\nNo, but thanks for making me want to cry again. Cool. Um, so that's that's not that guy\n\n45:58.100 --> 46:04.180\nYeah, so no, no, no, it's cool. And that's why I tipped him $2, you know, it's cool, you know on a $9 bill\n\n46:04.180 --> 46:09.540\nSo it's just totally fine. So um, so yeah, so like I took 10 minutes and I went outside and like okay\n\n46:09.540 --> 46:13.420\nI'm gonna call my parents and so we had like this. I don't know. I'm\n\n46:13.700 --> 46:20.820\n10 minutes probably over playing it probably six and a half minute conversation where I kind of realized that apparently my sister's not talking to me\n\n46:20.900 --> 46:22.900\nbut I don't know why\n\n46:23.380 --> 46:25.220\nand um, I\n\n46:25.220 --> 46:28.060\nFound out because I wanted to compliment her on her hairstyle\n\n46:30.860 --> 46:35.660\nWho knows she's not coming to the phone. So um, we're like we're like cousins you and me\n\n46:40.160 --> 46:45.760\nSo then it was like just this awkward like I want to say like 45 seconds where we just all sat on the phone\n\n46:46.140 --> 46:48.140\nNo one's saying\n\n46:48.340 --> 46:50.100\nAnd it's like\n\n46:50.100 --> 46:52.100\nOkay, well, I\n\n46:52.100 --> 46:56.540\nLove you.

That's cool\n\n47:03.180 --> 47:09.820\nLike don't it's okay. So then I like post something on Facebook to feel like I'm part of culture and\n\n47:13.300 --> 47:15.300\nOkay, it's the only\n\n47:16.380 --> 47:19.660\nEveryone else is saying something great about Thanksgiving.

I\n\n50:10.040 --> 50:17.160\nAppreciate it. You're like you're my brother from another mother. I thought that you really all day on Thursday.

Oh, you have no idea. Oh, yeah. Well, I mean this\n\n50:29.120 --> 50:31.120\nIt scares me though\n\n50:31.880 --> 50:35.800\nOn your shoulders because I know how fucking much that sucks, right?\n\n50:35.800 --> 50:41.800\nThat's the thing is you know how you would receive that if I said that to you. So then that makes me know that you're yeah\n\n50:41.800 --> 50:43.800\nThat's that it makes it fine. Yeah. Yeah\n\n50:44.600 --> 50:45.960\nWhat's nice?\n\n50:45.960 --> 50:48.480\nWhat do you what do you what do you what are you into?\n\n50:53.880 --> 50:55.880\nYou like diehard\n\n50:58.200 --> 51:01.700\nYou know like I'm into comedy and I like cartoons and\n\n51:01.700 --> 51:03.700\nI\n\n51:04.180 --> 51:07.060\nDrawing and stuff and I do you're an artist\n\n51:08.220 --> 51:11.420\nI'm trying to get better at saying yes to that question\n\n51:12.340 --> 51:18.460\nBecause it's like I grew up in a geography and a time where that wasn't a real thing that you went out and did\n\n51:19.100 --> 51:23.420\nAnd I'm not professionally an artist like I don't make money as an artist\n\n51:25.220 --> 51:26.980\nNo, I\n\n51:26.980 --> 51:34.700\nMean once upon a time. Yeah, like oh, I like in a dream world. Yes, but um, I mean realistically at this stage in my life like\n\n51:35.380 --> 51:37.380\nI'm paying my bills and I\n\n51:37.700 --> 51:39.700\nI'm making it as like\n\n51:40.300 --> 51:45.820\nAre you do you think you're kind of good at drawing? I'm kind of good at drawing. Yeah, what do you like to draw?\n\n51:45.820 --> 51:49.940\nWhen you like you like you doodle when you're like on the phone and stuff or I would you doodle like\n\n51:50.460 --> 51:54.780\nLike compulsively like some people do I'm not compulsive like some people\n\n51:54.780 --> 52:01.820\nAnd I know what you're talking about like like that kind of like I'm jealous of those people who like like need to be drawing\n\n52:01.820 --> 52:03.820\nYeah, that's one of the reasons why\n\n52:09.060 --> 52:10.660\nBut\n\n52:10.660 --> 52:15.460\nThat's one of the reasons why I thought maybe I'm not an artist because I had somebody say that to me once like well\n\n52:15.460 --> 52:17.820\nIf you can if you can just get through the day and you don't have to draw\n\n52:17.820 --> 52:22.300\nYeah, fuck that shit. No, that's that's that's a horrible thing to say. Okay. Maybe I'm not an artist\n\n52:22.300 --> 52:25.420\nBut like, you know, you have a Mickey Mouse in your shirt like a lot of our friends are\n\n52:25.820 --> 52:29.100\nDrawy types and I don't think that they would ever walk on the street and say hi\n\n52:29.100 --> 52:32.660\nI'm an artist some might and some might not but I think a lot of our friends like\n\n52:34.020 --> 52:36.020\nWhether they be\n\n52:36.060 --> 52:41.260\nAnimators or actors or musicians or whatever would would be very bashful about saying that they're artists\n\n52:41.260 --> 52:45.700\nI talked to this guy. I talked to a photographer over the weekend who I met\n\n52:45.700 --> 52:48.740\nIt was a very interesting conversation because I'm not a visual person at all\n\n52:48.740 --> 52:52.900\nI was like I was always I'm always interested to talk to like artists and photographers and stuff\n\n52:54.620 --> 53:00.060\nThe and he was talking late into the night as the as the booze hit and the\n\n53:00.900 --> 53:04.300\nYou know things got headier and deeper and sadder\n\n53:05.300 --> 53:10.420\nHe started talking about how, you know, there's all these things he wants to do with his photography, but like\n\n53:11.460 --> 53:16.900\nEvery like every once in a while. He's like, oh my god. I'm the worst fucking hack in the world. I suck\n\n53:16.900 --> 53:21.100\nI'm the worst. I'm like a joke. It's it's incredible that I ever took myself seriously\n\n53:21.100 --> 53:27.140\nI'm a fucking nuisance on society and then and then the next day. He'll be like, oh wow\n\n53:27.140 --> 53:32.660\nI'm I'm actually really good. I'm great and and and I was like, you know\n\n53:32.660 --> 53:40.060\nThat's like a piston going up and down like you don't want to be somebody who's just like even keeled about what they do\n\n53:40.060 --> 53:42.060\nIf you're a creative like you want to be\n\n53:42.060 --> 53:46.940\nFrankly bipolar like you like like whatever no offense to bipolar people\n\n53:46.940 --> 53:51.780\nBut I mean like you want to be literally have two poles because that's what an engine has it good\n\n53:51.780 --> 53:58.100\nIt's exploding one minute, and then it's not exploding the next minute. It's like and that's why the car goes vroom vroom, you know\n\n53:59.740 --> 54:01.740\nI ended up talking to\n\n54:02.500 --> 54:04.500\nIt's one of my friends. She's my ex\n\n54:05.340 --> 54:10.900\nWho I realized this week maybe that's the function of an ex is like because I've heard you tell stories about how your\n\n54:10.900 --> 54:13.940\nFriends with some of your exes or that you at least all of them\n\n54:13.940 --> 54:21.180\nYeah, like I'm starting to realize like what a wonderful thing that is in your life because these are people that know you so well and\n\n54:21.340 --> 54:22.940\nCan say\n\n54:22.940 --> 54:27.940\nAnything to you now because you don't have anything left to lose. Yeah, and so I don't know\n\n54:27.940 --> 54:29.860\nI was just kind of telling her about my shitty\n\n54:30.420 --> 54:33.500\nEmotional reaction of Thanksgiving and her point was a\n\n54:34.220 --> 54:39.940\nWhen have they said that they're proud of you ever like why do you keep expecting to hear that?\n\n54:39.940 --> 54:41.940\nBecause that's never something that's happened\n\n54:42.820 --> 54:45.180\nYou know it's just not good like they love you\n\n54:45.180 --> 54:52.420\nBut it's just they're never gonna say it in the words that you want to hear and then be would you be the ambitious creative person?\n\n54:52.420 --> 54:54.420\nYou are if they had\n\n54:55.100 --> 55:01.780\nManifest this love in the way that you want it to be manifest right and I was a conditional love pretty good pretty good for creative people\n\n55:01.780 --> 55:03.780\nI think\n\n55:05.260 --> 55:07.220\nI mean, I don't want to I don't want to you know\n\n55:07.220 --> 55:12.700\nI'm sure there's there I also meet a lot of people that seem really talented and they're like, oh, I love my parents\n\n55:20.940 --> 55:26.140\nWe're given a camera wise could you just move down closer to death so we can get you guys on a sexy two-shot\n\n55:28.780 --> 55:34.220\nAll right, so right well, okay, there's two things we can do we'll do them in this order\n\n55:34.220 --> 55:41.860\nSo do you want to try an exercise that my therapist did with me once sure, okay?\n\n55:41.860 --> 55:46.060\nIt might make you cry though. All right, okay, but I'm probably not that good\n\n55:47.060 --> 55:50.940\nShe spent years of training, but I'm good at crying. So all right, so\n\n55:52.020 --> 55:53.700\nOkay, so\n\n55:53.700 --> 55:55.700\nSo imagine yourself\n\n55:55.940 --> 56:00.060\nMaybe it might help if you close your eyes. She should we all be doing this or just just well\n\n56:00.060 --> 56:04.220\nNo, you can just participate. I guess but if you all talk at the same time, that'll be weird\n\n56:06.300 --> 56:10.020\nYou know like when Tom Cruise has to hold his breath for three minutes y'all kind of hold your breath\n\n56:10.020 --> 56:14.180\nYeah, it's like like then halfway through it. You're like, okay, and then you just watch the rest of the movie\n\n56:18.220 --> 56:23.140\nThe the I never even I hold I always hope my breath like what or before the guy goes into the water\n\n56:23.180 --> 56:29.220\nBecause I was like and I still can't even make that gap because it's like you got three minutes to diffuse that underwater bomb\n\n56:29.220 --> 56:31.220\nAnd I'm like, and then he's like\n\n56:32.260 --> 56:34.660\nHe's not done saying like wish me luck and I'm like\n\n56:38.860 --> 56:44.740\nI've never I've never done I've never tried I always do that really if you show me a movie where a guy has to hold his breath\n\n56:45.100 --> 56:47.100\napplause people do that Wow\n\n56:47.700 --> 56:50.420\nBecause I always want to just measure like when I'd be dead\n\n56:51.340 --> 56:54.540\nIf in a movie someone said okay, you have to hold your breath for three minutes\n\n56:54.540 --> 56:59.140\nI would just go oh, I know I can't do that like I could maybe do a minute and I'd be bummed out\n\n56:59.140 --> 57:01.420\nAnd that's why I would just not they don't always say it\n\n57:01.420 --> 57:05.860\nThey don't always call it out, but you can see that they're gonna go into water. They're like, oh, that's all under water\n\n57:05.860 --> 57:08.160\nI was gonna be underwater scene. So I'm like, okay\n\n57:08.160 --> 57:11.820\nI want to see if I could and I'm just sitting at a couch and the guy's going like that\n\n57:11.820 --> 57:13.860\nI can't even go like this without running out of breath\n\n57:17.820 --> 57:22.900\nSo joke so it's all right. It's all right cry exercise. All right Thanksgiving\n\n57:22.900 --> 57:32.700\nExercise, okay for all of you like fractured people close your eyes. Okay, you are you you're the adult you\n\n57:33.220 --> 57:39.780\nYou are in the home that you were in when you were a child\n\n57:40.340 --> 57:42.180\nBut you're adult you\n\n57:42.180 --> 57:45.860\nThe home that your bedroom was in when you were let's say\n\n57:46.500 --> 57:48.500\n10 years old\n\n57:48.980 --> 57:50.980\nSo picture that home\n\n57:50.980 --> 57:52.980\nYou're in it\n\n57:53.740 --> 57:55.060\nsomewhere\n\n57:55.060 --> 57:56.340\nliving room\n\n57:56.340 --> 57:57.500\nkitchen\n\n57:57.500 --> 57:59.500\nThose are the two possibilities\n\n58:00.900 --> 58:06.780\nSo somewhere in this home is the bedroom that you slept in when you were 10\n\n58:08.140 --> 58:10.340\nSo now you're gonna walk\n\n58:11.820 --> 58:15.700\nSlowly to that door of that bedroom\n\n58:15.700 --> 58:23.140\nI say slowly so that you can really picture it like because you remember what the carpet looked like you remember the walls\n\n58:23.740 --> 58:25.740\nLittle Chachke's whatever\n\n58:27.100 --> 58:31.500\nNow you get to the door and you're gonna open it and\n\n58:33.100 --> 58:39.340\nYour 10 year old self is sitting in their bedroom on the bed\n\n58:40.780 --> 58:43.180\nSo picture who you were when you were 10\n\n58:43.180 --> 58:45.460\nYou are who you are now\n\n58:47.540 --> 58:49.540\nNow\n\n58:49.700 --> 58:56.660\nYou at home do this in your own head, but Heather will you describe that child physically?\n\n58:59.740 --> 59:03.780\nIn a lot of ways, I guess it's what I'm trying to emulate now\n\n59:06.340 --> 59:10.980\nSmall always been small for my age long brown hair bangs\n\n59:10.980 --> 59:12.980\nNo glasses yet\n\n59:13.820 --> 59:18.380\nNot cuz I didn't need them just cuz I didn't have any health insurance and we didn't realize it\n\n59:22.180 --> 59:24.180\nShared the room with my sister\n\n59:26.100 --> 59:28.100\nIn a queen bed\n\n59:29.300 --> 59:35.060\nSo 10 year old Heather's sitting there what might she typically be doing\n\n59:37.580 --> 59:39.020\nDrawing\n\n59:39.020 --> 59:44.300\nSo she's drawing now you're gonna sit down on the bed a comfortable distance from her\n\n59:45.100 --> 59:47.900\nYour adult self look at your 10 year old self\n\n59:50.460 --> 59:52.860\nWhat what do you think of her?\n\n59:54.780 --> 59:59.220\nLike don't say what you think you're supposed to say like\n\n59:59.220 --> 01:00:06.220\nJudge her or or praise her. What do you really think of her? Oh?\n\n01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:30.860\nI wish I could tell her that it doesn't you don't have to be so afraid that you're gonna spend the next 25 years being afraid and\n\n01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:37.540\nAnd you don't have to but is she afraid now?\n\n01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.780\n10 at 10.

They saw witches are coming with all my turkey bitches\n\n01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:35.520\nGot a east coast because the coast is the most especially when there's no other coast yet\n\n01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:47.600\nSo thanksgiving is great and thanksgiving is fine and sometimes you think I just want someone to like me a little\n\n01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:51.240\nAnd maybe I would like it if I heard my mom say hey, I'm proud\n\n01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:57.160\nBut then I think well at least I didn't go to some thanksgiving where my mom is trying to fuck some stranger\n\n01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.520\nCuz that would make me feel kind of awkward and maybe like I wouldn't want to go home as much either\n\n01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:06.440\nSo I guess it's good that we can just say hey and call each other once in a while\n\n01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:18.440\nAnd you know, I'll like call again on Christmas\n\n01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.920\nI think it's the hype whomever he pleases and we bring it back\n\n01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:27.920\nOh, man, let's go\n\n01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.520\nmashed potatoes\n\n01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:40.920\nYo take the ferry from Staten Island to Manhattan\n\n01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.340\nMama so hard 9-eleven.

Yeah, let's have a hand for Heather\n\n01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:17.840\nAll right, no take the shirt. I mean, I'm not assuming you want it, but be weird to bail on that\n\n01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.920\nSo she got eighty one dollars forty of what she gave away to gauge\n\n01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.000\nYeah, you're right\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.800\nAnd then she got a shirt and a DVD of Inglorious bastards. Yeah, that's a fucking big haul\n\n01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:35.320\nAnd I gave her the shirt off my back literally and and Robert was like yeah\n\n01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:38.640\nI went to some people's house and like I wasn't very grateful and\n\n01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.400\nThen gauge was like what am I gonna do? I can't be a dad\n\n01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:52.200\nIt's like we kind of hit all the fucking mountains and valleys of this season like I\n\n01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.280\nNow Steve\n\n01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:01.320\nHow clear or unclear I hear the concept of\n\n01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:07.360\nI don't know idea did you ever listen to\n\n01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:14.080\nBears by last week that I didn't even what about public enemy. Are you familiar with them? I know flavor Flav\n\n01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:21.200\nYeah, he had a clock. I've seen it and then he'd say people he go what time it is right and he'd say Joe Chuck\n\n01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:26.520\nTell people things because they haven't heard it yet, and then Chuck would be like sometimes you'd be like\n\n01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.520\nI don't know if I can\n\n01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:35.000\nI don't think I don't think they're ready for you Chuck. Yeah, are they ready? Are you ready? Like he would like get the crowd\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.880\nYeah for the science that may or may not be drunk\n\n01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:44.480\nAnd you know why that's important for black men in the 90s. Tell me\n\n01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.760\nThen still mad about you hyping Heather\n\n01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.280\nWell, that's weird to hype. That's like hyping Vincent Price\n\n01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.880\nIt's it's\n\n01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:04.920\nThat's weird. He doesn't have a hype valve. She was the she was the Rihanna. Like you don't hype Rihanna Rihanna is fine\n\n01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:12.160\nHype hype Eminem she was a guest. I thought you know she did fine. She doesn't need hyping\n\n01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.880\nDon't give don't give hype notes. He was hyping people. I've got to give him hype notes\n\n01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:20.480\nYou were just you just started the hype note session. I was just asking what you know, he's you know, he's you know\n\n01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.480\nHe's right. I would say like\n\n01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:30.960\nUh, does the Steve Levy know about hype manning? No, but but do we how much do we want to change Steve Levy's version of hyping?\n\n01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.960\nWell, not not like 20%\n\n01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:38.160\nLike I still want it to be kind of like I still want you to go. Yeah\n\n01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:43.920\nPut your hands together. He didn't even do that. He just said like it's Dan Harmon. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing\n\n01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.800\nIt's great. Ah Steve. Ah Steve\n\n01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:52.360\nSteve you Steve how is your your connection with your family over the holidays?\n\n01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.360\nAre you close family?\n\n01:11:54.680 --> 01:12:01.800\nYeah, I I didn't obviously didn't go home.

Yeah\n\n01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.640\nMy family is pretty tight knit. You guys get along. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no black sheep\n\n01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:18.120\nNo, and you hit like everybody hates or no, no not at all. Do you have a very well balanced like awesome thing?\n\n01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.760\nYeah, we do. It's kind of it's strange. I guess people like\n\n01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.600\nThe circles I roll and it's like I'm like a monster. Yeah\n\n01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:32.520\nYeah, I uh, that's sorry. I always felt like yeah, you're like a monster. I know\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.600\nThere's a deficit in my in my I have no ambition and I don't think I'm as creative as my as my friends\n\n01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:44.280\nUh, who didn't like their parents. I like my family like I think that that that's uh, that's a real, uh\n\n01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:47.320\nWay to have a terrible career and entertainment\n\n01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.600\nYeah, I I love my family. I do and uh, I\n\n01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.720\nI don't know I texted with them. I called them\n\n01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.400\nI heard I heard from them wish them happy. That's why it's why you're not a\n\n01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:07.480\nA born hype man because that's arbitrary. Like you were born with hype built into your right. You are you you you came pre-hyped\n\n01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:13.400\nCame out of the womb with hype in you and your mom hyped you and\n\n01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:19.080\nYou like you're everyone's hyped around you people are generally hyped by you\n\n01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:24.600\nWithout you having to hype them. Yeah, like I get hyped just be just to see your smile every morning\n\n01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.640\nThat's what I said\n\n01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.400\nThank you. Yeah\n\n01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:33.080\nI remember when you got that mouth surgery. Yeah, I was like I almost killed myself\n\n01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:38.840\nBecause you were acting the way I would act if I were you which is to be like, okay, so here's the third\n\n01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.080\nYou have a really busy day tomorrow\n\n01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.760\nI need I need the seething joy\n\n01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.880\nSo I can blot it out. Well, you got it\n\n01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:56.440\nBrain really tomorrow morning. I'll be I'll be right there smiling making sure everything gets done right\n\n01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.240\nSo he's a natural mellow\n\n01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.280\nYou know water and ninja hype man like he\n\n01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.320\nSteve fills the lowest places\n\n01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.760\nDone like all day. He's hyping all day flavor flays probably a piece of shit most of the day\n\n01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:14.360\nAnd then he's like compensating when he gets out and stays with chuck\n\n01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:21.400\nHe probably probably right before public enemy went on. I'm sure I'm sure flavor flavor is probably like yo chuck use a coaster, man\n\n01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.800\nRight, and chuck and chuck's like what why do I have to use a coaster?\n\n01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:32.200\nIt's my bad. Yo, man. You think you try going out there without the guy with a clock around his neck, man\n\n01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.760\nUse a fucking coaster when you're in my trailer\n\n01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:41.800\nOh, it's fine, but you kind of fucking you fucking me up, man.

Let's get serious.\n\n01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.240\nAlright.\n\n01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.240\nSo some people are going to be walking out there with some buckets right now.\n\n01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:48.240\nAnd, you know, leukemia is bad.\n\n01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.240\nThat whole thing was really where I think Spencer was cracking up.\n\n01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:57.240\nOh, I loved it. I loved when Jeff started beeping and booping and you were really getting intense.\n\n01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:59.240\nThat was the best.\n\n01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.240\nFuck, man.\n\n01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:02.240\nWhat did you do for Thanksgiving, Spencer?\n\n01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:10.240\nOh, man. I just... No, I went to Dino's thing. He had his family over and then a bunch of people from Starburn's.\n\n01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:16.240\nVery not funny. A kid fell in a cactus. That's kind of funny, I guess.\n\n01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.240\nYeah, that was sad.\n\n01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.240\nWell, I thought that was funny.\n\n01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:23.240\nWhich kid was it? I was kid?\n\n01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:29.240\nNo, it was Io's tenance three-year-old daughter.\n\n01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:30.240\nThat sounds right.\n\n01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.240\nThat's not funny. If it was Io's kid, that's kind of funny.\n\n01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:36.240\nBecause that kid's kind of a terror.\n\n01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.240\nThat's what Dino was saying.\n\n01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:41.240\nHe was being so mean. I was like, oh, he's a good kid.\n\n01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:43.240\nI mean, he's a resilient kid. He can handle it.\n\n01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:44.240\nDino's kicking him.\n\n01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:49.240\nYeah. Well, believe me, nothing's going to stop him from serial killing, so it doesn't...\n\n01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:53.240\nAnd the kid's like absolutely destined to be a serial killer.\n\n01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:56.240\nSpencer, did you communicate with your family at all, your mom and dad?\n\n01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:01.240\nMy mom texted me. She's like, happy Thanksgiving. I'm so thankful for you.\n\n01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:06.240\nAnd then two days later, I was like, oh, yeah, I really miss your stuffing.\n\n01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:11.240\nAnd then she was like, oh, you know, we're having dinner right now. You could come right over.\n\n01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:18.240\nAnd then two days later, I was like, that would have been good.\n\n01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:21.240\nHow often have you been back to your parents' house at all?\n\n01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:25.240\nMy parents' house is no longer like they sold it off.\n\n01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:30.240\nAnd my dad moved to Columbia and my mom's couch surfing across America or something.\n\n01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.240\nColumbia?\n\n01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.240\nYeah.\n\n01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.240\nCatch up, man.\n\n01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.240\nNo, it's fine.\n\n01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:38.240\nI did not know that your dad fucked off to a...\n\n01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:44.240\nYeah, he fucked off there. He's teaching animation. He's not an animator.\n\n01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:48.240\nSo he's not really a teacher.\n\n01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:53.240\nI think he now speaks Spanish, which I hope they speak over there.\n\n01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.240\nI believe they do.\n\n01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.240\nOkay, good. Bass is covered.\n\n01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.240\nBut yeah, no, it's just really weird.\n\n01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:04.240\nIt's weird that he now teaches animation in Columbia.\n\n01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:08.240\nSo he's like, first day of class, everybody draw a picture.\n\n01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.240\nAll right, go home.\n\n01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:16.240\nAnd then they come back and he's like, okay, now draw the same picture, but a little different.\n\n01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:20.240\nAnd he's like, why isn't this different? You get enough.\n\n01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:22.240\nWhy is this too different?\n\n01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:26.240\nAnd then they slowly learn how to animate.\n\n01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.240\nIt's probably that hard to teach, really.\n\n01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.240\nYeah, I mean, it's probably not hard to teach a lot of disciplines.\n\n01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.240\nYeah, like name a discipline.\n\n01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.240\nI heard karate.\n\n01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.240\nCPR.\n\n01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:41.240\nYeah, just push on their chest until it makes their heart beat more.\n\n01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.240\nOr karate until it stops beating.\n\n01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:48.240\nYeah.\n\n01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:52.240\nYeah, you can teach karate and CPR and CPR.\n\n01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:58.240\nYou can just give people a degree in one and then go now flip it.\n\n01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:02.240\nYou have a special school, Spencer's School of CPR and Karate.\n\n01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:07.240\nAnd your degree is like a playing card, like where you turn it upside down.\n\n01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:09.240\nAnd it's like...\n\n01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:12.240\nThe problem is reversible.\n\n01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:18.240\nUh, what?\n\n01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:20.240\nI bet you...\n\n01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.240\nOh, sex ed, yeah, we'll put your winner in the...\n\n01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.240\nAnybody does teach that.\n\n01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.240\nNot a joke.\n\n01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.240\nToo many people teach in that.\n\n01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.240\nKids having kids, am I right, Gage?\n\n01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.240\nWhoa!\n\n01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.240\nWhat?\n\n01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:40.240\nJesus, he knows!\n\n01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:42.240\nI'm sorry, that was insensitive.\n\n01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.240\nI apologize, Gage.\n\n01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.240\nI acknowledge my crime.\n\n01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:51.240\nI express remorse and I commit to change.\n\n01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:55.240\nThat's what they taught me how to do in Apple.\n\n01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:58.240\nThat's like literally in the employee training.\n\n01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.240\nThat's a real apology.\n\n01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:00.240\nLike the three ingredients.\n\n01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:03.240\nBut you can't really just say them like I said.\n\n01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:09.240\nAlso, I think it diminishes it to look at your fingers and count them up.\n\n01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:14.240\nWhat else should I apologize for?\n\n01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.240\nI'm sorry I yelled at that kid on Twitter.\n\n01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:17.240\nWhat kid?\n\n01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:18.240\nWhat that kid?\n\n01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:20.240\nWhatever that kid, I yelled at that kid on Twitter.\n\n01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.240\nBack like months ago?\n\n01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:23.240\nYeah, last time we were in New York.\n\n01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.240\nHey kid, I'm sorry.\n\n01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.240\nI yelled at you on Twitter.\n\n01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.240\nI feel bad.\n\n01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.240\nI won't yell at you on Twitter again.\n\n01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.240\nBecause your account's private now.\n\n01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:38.240\nYeah.\n\n01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.240\nI've been yelling at Gamergate all weekend on Twitter.\n\n01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:47.240\nI caught a tiny bit of that and I tried to look back and find the origin and it was too much work.\n\n01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:48.240\nSo what the hell's going on?\n\n01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:50.240\nYou know that Graham Linehan.\n\n01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:51.240\nHe's a great man.\n\n01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.240\nGreat man, that Graham Linehan.\n\n01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:56.240\nHe posted something and talked about.\n\n01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:01.240\nIt was like a news article and talked about how he says that remote radicalization is a serious thing\n\n01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.240\nand it could happen in Gamergate and I was like,\n\n01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.240\nGamergate, those idiots.\n\n01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.240\nAnd you know, the floodgates opened.\n\n01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:08.240\nOh man.\n\n01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:13.240\nSo just the past 48 hours have just been telling people to kill themselves\n\n01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:16.240\nand then blocking those people.\n\n01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:18.240\nI saw some guys like,\n\n01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:20.240\nI don't know if you guys like Harmonjam, it's Spencer Crittenden.\n\n01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.240\nI know to Dan Harmon they tweeted that.\n\n01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:25.240\nIt's like, were you here two weeks ago?\n\n01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.240\nWhat do you think is going to happen?\n\n01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:32.240\nPeople were telling on you to me.\n\n01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:37.240\nThe reason I know about it is my name was added on to that thing.\n\n01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:40.240\nIt's like, hey, Jeff Davis, Erin McGathy, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.240\nYeah, Erin McGathy's here.\n\n01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.240\nYeah, Spencer Crittenden really wants everyone to kill themselves.\n\n01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:50.240\nClick here if you want to see all the rich tapestry of all the time as Spencer.\n\n01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:54.240\nThey added in a mosaic that formed my face when you zoomed it out.\n\n01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:04.240\nIt's like Mad Magazine's 50th anniversary cover.\n\n01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:08.240\nYeah, well, yeah.\n\n01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:14.240\nOkay, so yeah, if you're 16, talk to somebody.\n\n01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.240\nUnless you're in Gamergate.\n\n01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:18.240\nUnless you're in Gamergate, unless you're a Gamergator, then yeah, kill yourself.\n\n01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.240\nYou've forfeited your life anyway, yeah.\n\n01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:20.240\nI mean, I would say.\n\n01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.240\nPlease, and I know that I'm the only person in the room that has no idea what that is.\n\n01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:27.240\nGamergate means that there was a time when a woman said something and all the gamer games told her.\n\n01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:30.240\nYeah, I mean, it would take us five minutes of going through it and even just in going.\n\n01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:31.240\nIt's one of those issues where they're going.\n\n01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:33.240\nWell, I think I can build off his thing in 30 seconds.\n\n01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:36.240\nWhat you just said happened.\n\n01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:39.240\nAnd then from then on, everyone's like, no, it didn't.\n\n01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:42.240\nAnd then, you know, some people are like, well, yeah, that's that's history.\n\n01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.240\nAnd then they are like, no, you're wrong.\n\n01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.240\nAnd now I'm going to bother you for two days straight because we don't believe in recording history.\n\n01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:56.240\nWhen we retell history, we talk about stories and we talk about people as if there's like these events that happen.\n\n01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:59.240\nLike, oh, Archbishop Ferdinand got assassinated in that.\n\n01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.240\nBut it's like, no.\n\n01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.240\nArchduke.\n\n01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.240\nWhatever.\n\n01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:05.240\nDon't rewrite history.\n\n01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:09.240\nHe was effectively defrocked that day.\n\n01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:13.240\nBut it's like, we only do that because we have to have something to talk about.\n\n01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:22.240\nBut the scary thing is that's the scary thing about the Trump thing, because if it's like, honestly, like, it's not a joke anymore to say, like, he's Hitler.\n\n01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:25.240\nLike, and that he's exactly like Hitler and that he's Hitler.\n\n01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:28.240\nIt's not a joke because like Hitler had a funny haircut and everyone was kept.\n\n01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:34.240\nAnd he was a reality television star, basically, because he wrote Mein Kampf and was like, oh, look at me.\n\n01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.240\nEverybody look at me.\n\n01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:38.240\nAnd he wasn't a genius and he wasn't like an idealist at all.\n\n01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:47.240\nHe wasn't like a person that was like, I think we should all do this or he was just a guy that was like mad and dumb and was in the like, like, like, like he served a purpose.\n\n01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:56.240\nAnd like this, these like the weird thing about that gamer gate thing is it's like what you because you keep asking yourself like, well, why would you if you ever were getting involved in this?\n\n01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:00.240\nWhy would you even still be arguing about all this stuff?\n\n01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:04.240\nAnd the answer is because it's never about like these events or these people.\n\n01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:07.240\nIt's always about like these weird like shifts, like these biomasses.\n\n01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:11.240\nThey just build up frustration and shame and rage.\n\n01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.240\nAnd then they flow this way or that way.\n\n01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:21.240\nAnd there's like these magmatic like like eruptions and everybody that's that is like beating people at Donald Trump rallies and being into it.\n\n01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:24.240\nThey take they know like they're not there.\n\n01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.240\nThey know he's an idiot like and they're into it like they're like, oh, good.\n\n01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.240\nHe's going to say it.\n\n01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:36.240\nSo like I can now I can hit this guy with a pole and then Donald Trump's like like that guy hit a guy with a pole because I'm very popular.\n\n01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:40.240\nAnd he's like an idiot like he doesn't he doesn't know what he's doing.\n\n01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:48.240\nLike that's the scary thing is like he the humanities like evil like it gathers in these clouds and it's just like and it's because of hero worship.\n\n01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:56.240\nIt's because we think that individuals are like important and that oh, you said that you should be the way we're going to cut this guy's head off.\n\n01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.240\nAnd if we cut that guy's head off, then nothing bad will happen anymore.\n\n01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:03.240\nAnd thinking that is what allows for like these clouds of evil to spread.\n\n01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:07.240\nAnd like like like that's what's happening right now or like living in history.\n\n01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.240\nLike there's a fucking fascist running for president and he doesn't make him cool at all.\n\n01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:14.240\nIt doesn't even make him cool in like a fucking bad guy way.\n\n01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.240\nHe's just a fucking clown.\n\n01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:25.240\nBut he's like there's so many angry fucking people that are like they're just like and they're not even like can you imagine like after World War One how they were using like wads of money for door stops and toilet paper.\n\n01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.240\nLike that's how fucking scared they were.\n\n01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:35.240\nWe're just like oh I have to golf nine holes instead of 18 like and there's fucking hitting Hispanic people at rallies.\n\n01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:42.240\nAnd then they're saying to him like hey what about that guy that got beaten at your rally and he's like well my fans are passionate.\n\n01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:49.240\nLike it's fucking and his hair is everywhere and everyone's like hardy har har like fucking like he's Hitler.\n\n01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:55.240\nHe's Hitler which is not it doesn't make him important doesn't make him strong doesn't make him scary even.\n\n01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:57.240\nIt makes the fucking situation scary.\n\n01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:58.240\nHe's Hitler.\n\n01:40:58.240 --> 01:40:59.240\nWe're scary.\n\n01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:01.240\nLike we're doing fucked up scary shit.\n\n01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:09.240\nGamergate is fucking another one of those things because those guys those guys got in a van and like went and shot up that like.\n\n01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:11.240\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:12.240\nThose are like 4chan.\n\n01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:19.240\nThere was like a guy from 4chan that 4chan doesn't even like that was like went and shot the black lives matter.\n\n01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:24.240\nThey were like oh I don't know if they were related to the agitators at the Minnesota protests.\n\n01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.240\nThere was like video.\n\n01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.240\nI don't know.\n\n01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.240\nIt's somehow related in there.\n\n01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:34.240\nI'm not I'm not the last thing I'm going to do is go like yeah 4chan anything because it's fucking credit cards shut off tomorrow.\n\n01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:46.240\nBut the the the but because that guy was like some knob who was like there was like a guy in the video who was like oh I'm going to go do this like that.\n\n01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:49.240\nI'm going to go troll the like black lives matter.\n\n01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:53.240\nAnd then guns at him getting fired and five people got shot.\n\n01:41:53.240 --> 01:42:08.240\nAnyways but it but my point being friend friend yes fringe groups radical groups dumb dumb ass fascist like politicians like what's happening right now is just as as gradual and dangerous as the weather.\n\n01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:19.240\nOr as like a super volcano under Yellowstone it's not it has nothing to do with like oh no how if this election goes wrong it's like fucking people are getting dumber and dumber and dumber and more and more dangerous.\n\n01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:20.240\nWhat are we going to do about it.\n\n01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:22.240\nMillennials.\n\n01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:26.240\nKeep hashtagging.\n\n01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:31.240\nMake sure hashtag keep hashtagging.\n\n01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:34.240\nMake sure everybody is real polite to each other.\n\n01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:37.240\nThere's a fucking fascist running for president.\n\n01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:39.240\nAnd you can't do anything about it.\n\n01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:41.240\nLike there's nothing grab a brick.\n\n01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:45.240\nTell him I sent you grab a fucking brick and throw it through something.\n\n01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:48.240\nI don't think I don't think Donald Trump was a fascist.\n\n01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:51.240\nI think that he no he's a fucking fascist.\n\n01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:52.240\nI think this is not an argument.\n\n01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:59.240\nI think he's a windsock he goes where that's what a fascist is exactly an opportunistic infection in a time of economic.\n\n01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:06.240\nHe caters to people that like if he if he finds out that fascists will vote for him he will do exactly their bid.\n\n01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.240\nThat's what I said brother dog.\n\n01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.240\nDon't don't irritate me.\n\n01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.240\nThat's what I said.\n\n01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:15.240\nBut like but like Adolf Hitler sat in the cell and wrote down some like some terrible fucking horrible shit.\n\n01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:18.240\nI don't know if it was all that intelligent.\n\n01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:19.240\nHe just wrote it.\n\n01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:21.240\nIt's just time moves slower back.\n\n01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:22.240\nThat's all.\n\n01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:25.240\nHe's sat in a cell for four years and wrote a dumb ass book like Donald Trump was on a fucking reality show.\n\n01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:26.240\nYou're fired.\n\n01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.240\nYou're fired.\n\n01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:31.240\nLike it's just he's he's and he put on a baseball cap was like I'll be president.\n\n01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:34.240\nLike it's like everyone's like yeah.\n\n01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:37.240\nI'm going to associate that with the things that make me angry.\n\n01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.240\nAnd he's like OK.\n\n01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:40.240\nI heard that like that's the scary.\n\n01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:48.240\nI think there are more dangerous people in the Republican Party like they actually have more like for me like a little bit more like violent fascistic views.\n\n01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:50.240\nThey actually really do believe it.\n\n01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:53.240\nI don't I don't know that Donald Trump particularly believes in anything at all.\n\n01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:55.240\nWhy are we talking to a brick wall.\n\n01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:56.240\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.240\nThat's what makes him dangerous.\n\n01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.240\nHe's a fucking idiot.\n\n01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:00.240\nHe doesn't believe in anything.\n\n01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:07.240\nThat means that people who are their clockwork orging people they're fucking beating people with sticks.\n\n01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:13.240\nAnd he's saying and then they're asking him about it on morning shows and he's going like well my fans are number one.\n\n01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:18.240\nLike like he's that's what's dangerous not a fucking guy who's like I'm going to take over the world.\n\n01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:19.240\nLike like that guy's fine.\n\n01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.240\nWe've been living with that for 60 years.\n\n01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:26.240\nWell like like like I'm saying this guy's a fucking a class number one dipshit.\n\n01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:30.240\nLike he called Mexicans rapists and he's still running.\n\n01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:32.240\nHe's still getting out of bed every morning.\n\n01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:38.240\nHe's just the right kind of dumb to fucking like make some horrible people able to do shit.\n\n01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:41.240\nLike like like we're one step from like history here.\n\n01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.240\nYeah the whole thing now the whole like.\n\n01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:44.240\nAnd I was wrong by the way.\n\n01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:47.240\nThat's I forgot to mention that I fucking full retraction.\n\n01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:51.240\nRemember when Erin went to Ireland and she's like everyone here is worried that Trump's going to be president.\n\n01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:53.240\nAnd I was like come on give us a fucking joke.\n\n01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.240\nI have never been wronger in my life.\n\n01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:57.240\nI'm so wrong.\n\n01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:58.240\nI'm so terrified right now.\n\n01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:05.240\nHe slipped 10 points in very recent history which is a pretty big drop percentage points.\n\n01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:06.240\nWhat do you think he finally did wrong.\n\n01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:08.240\nDid he like eat a baby.\n\n01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:12.240\nI think people just saw how good he was doing and be like we can't just stand by.\n\n01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:17.240\nWe got to vote in these polls.\n\n01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:21.240\nPolls.\n\n01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:25.240\nAnybody here a Trump supporter and don't clap ironically anybody.\n\n01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:28.240\nI would love to meet somebody and not like not ironically.\n\n01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.240\nI heard why I heard a guy and I was like like this is how they sound.\n\n01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:37.240\nSo there was a guy because they were talking about that whole thing of how like well this is a fucking historical game changer where people are\n\n01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:41.240\nphysically beaten at your speeches and you don't condemn it.\n\n01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:48.240\nLike the and so they're asking this guy about it and he said his his his response.\n\n01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:50.240\nHe was like a spokesman or something.\n\n01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.240\nIt was like a and he said come on.\n\n01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:53.240\nThis is just ridiculous.\n\n01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:59.240\nLike if it like what is every time a black man commits a crime is it Obama's fault.\n\n01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:06.240\nThat's what the guy said was like what the fucking deep dark glance into like the weird weirdest fucking what the fuck.\n\n01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:09.240\nLike like that's what they sound like.\n\n01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:12.240\nThat's skinhead talk dude.\n\n01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:14.240\nCowabunga.\n\n01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:17.240\nThat's fucking like that's scary.\n\n01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:21.240\nThat guy was wearing a tie probably.\n\n01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.240\nHe's probably older than me.\n\n01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:30.240\nHe's like old like like like like imagine like a imagine imagine when some of these fucking kids like like like like like you know like\n\n01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:32.240\nwhat does it take to flip them.\n\n01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:37.240\nHe's fucking these these kids like what does it really take to fucking flip them like on a fellow piece.\n\n01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:40.240\nYou know like like they they love they love being team players.\n\n01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:41.240\nThey love they love code.\n\n01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:43.240\nThey love language being right.\n\n01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:46.240\nThey love like being like part of something bigger than them.\n\n01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:47.240\nLike what is it.\n\n01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:48.240\nThat terrifies me too.\n\n01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:57.240\nThere's 90 degree intersection between a generation with a total capacity for fucking like teamwork and this like floppy haired\n\n01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:03.240\nweirdo going like America's used to be number one we should be the immigrants are bad.\n\n01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:08.240\nLike like like I just worried about like like a 1980s V mini series happening here.\n\n01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:17.240\nIt's like kids with red jumpsuits on going like I'm a visitor scout get off to the camps with you.\n\n01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:21.240\nIf you're over 70 we got to eat you now.\n\n01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.240\nWe're going to make soap out of you.\n\n01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:31.240\nHashtag cancel Colbert.\n\n01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:33.240\nAnyways I just I just don't trust you guys.\n\n01:47:33.240 -->

01:47:40.240\nYou may I may be up against a wall.\n\n01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:41.240\nAll right.\n\n01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:42.240\nLet's play shadow run.\n\n01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:43.240\nOh

shouldn't have been shocked.\n\n01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:56.240\nIt wasn't your choice to play Shadowrun.\n\n01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:57.240\nI guess.\n\n01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:58.240\nYeah

--> 01:50:06.240\nBut we live in the future so it's futuristic key.\n\n01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:07.240\nBut you can do whatever you want.\n\n01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:10.240\nAnd you have a list of weapons

kilograms.\n\n01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:03.240\nAnd so that means Steve that you're probably playing Mercy right.\n\n01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:04.240\nI am Mercy.\n\n01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:05.240\nAll

--> 01:51:19.240\nLast time on Shadowrun the gang assaulted a woman's mind until she asked them for help.\n\n01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:23.240\nShe assigned them a mission to find her recovering ghoul daughter.\n\n01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:28.240\nJam who lasts whose last known whereabouts were a flesh to fresh center.\n\n01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:34.240\nAfter discussing strategy the gang decided their first stop will be the nano opium den.\n\n01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:35.240\nThe golden hole.\n\n01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:39.240\nWhat will they learn from their mob contact David McChinaman.\n\n01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:42.240\nAnd who will they offend in the process.\n\n01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:46.240\nFind out now on Harmon thing.\n\n01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:49.240\nDavid McChinaman I assume named by Thomas Middleditch.\n\n01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:50.240\nYep.\n\n01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:51.240\nSorry.\n\n01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:52.240\nSorry Jessica.\n\n01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:56.240\nWas it was it David David McChinaman or the Chinaman.\n\n01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:57.240\nNo David McChinaman.\n\n01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:58.240\nDavid McChinaman.\n\n01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.240\nThe Chinese person.\n\n01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:01.240\nHe's a little Irish.\n\n01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:02.240\nHe's mostly Irish.\n\n01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:03.240\nA little bit right.\n\n01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:08.240\nHe should eat at 23 and me and there was a little bit of Irish.\n\n01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:15.240\nSo we're going to the golden hole nano opium den to meet David McChinaman.\n\n01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:16.240\nChinaman.\n\n01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:19.240\nWho's doctor friends contact in the mob.\n\n01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:20.240\nAll right.\n\n01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:24.240\nAnd maybe that contact will know something about the disappearance of the flesh to fresh franchise.\n\n01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:25.240\nYeah.\n\n01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.240\nAll right.\n\n01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:29.240\nSo is our Uber pulled up to the golden hole.\n\n01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:31.240\nIt is now presently.\n\n01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:35.240\nYou roll up to a trash filled alleyway and your Uber comes to a halt.\n\n01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:37.240\nYou see the back door to the golden hole.\n\n01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:40.240\nThe nano opium den run by the golden six.\n\n01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:43.240\nA triad in the Seattle underground.\n\n01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:45.240\nA triad's like a Chinese mafia.\n\n01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:48.240\nPast the incinerator and piles of garbage bags.\n\n01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:54.240\nYou can see a small metal door with a retro neon sign saying AR only club.\n\n01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:58.240\nOutside the door is a bald Asian man in a black suit and tie and shades.\n\n01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.240\nAR only club.\n\n01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:01.240\nAR only club.\n\n01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:02.240\nThat's what the science.\n\n01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:03.240\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:05.240\nThat AR is what is it?\n\n01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:06.240\nAugmented reality.\n\n01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:07.240\nAugmented reality.\n\n01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:08.240\nYeah.\n\n01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:12.240\nWhich means it's a kind of it's a kind of technology that is used socially.\n\n01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:13.240\nOkay.\n\n01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:18.240\nSo they won't they won't allow a VR in there.\n\n01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:20.240\nVR is like next level AR.\n\n01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:25.240\nIf you have VR you could you could use it but it's part of your AR.\n\n01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:27.240\nThis is engaging stuff.\n\n01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:29.240\nDo we all just have AR built in because we're future people.\n\n01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:31.240\nI mean I don't know that off hand.\n\n01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:32.240\nI think some of you do.\n\n01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:37.240\nIt's in your equipment which I'm sure will be easy for you to just skim and find.\n\n01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:44.240\nAll I have is my nano like eyepiece for my contact lens that helps me like look at things.\n\n01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:45.240\nWho are you playing Steve?\n\n01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:46.240\nI'm Mercy.\n\n01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:47.240\nDoes that count Spencer?\n\n01:53:47.240 -->

of virtual reality.\n\n01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:59.240\nThe virtual reality in question is largely rendered mists, red mists that add to the\n\n01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:02.240\ndepth of the opium den mystique.\n\n01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:05.240\nOh shit.\n\n01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:06.880\nAre we all getting high?\n\n01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:08.740\nYou can smell the drugs.\n\n01:57:08.740 -->

drugs.\n\n01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.240\nThe room though...\n\n01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:19.240\nYou know how I roll.\n\n01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:22.240\nThe place is full of circular booths with hukas.\n\n01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:24.240\nThere's people sitting at the hukas.\n\n01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:28.240\nThere's all sorts of business men and also dudes wearing Hawaiian shirts are just kind\n\n01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:31.240\nof sprawled out around the hukas.\n\n01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:32.240\nOpium and...\n\n01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:38.240\nI walk up to the bouncer and say hey do you know where David McChanaman is?\n\n01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:40.240\nWe don't give out of those information.\n\n01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:41.240\nThis is a nano opium den.\n\n01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:43.240\nWe can't just give out people's...\n\n01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:47.240\nWe take out a thousand Nuiyan and I say do you know where David McManaman is?\n\n01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:48.240\nMcManaman.\n\n01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.240\nMcChinaman is.\n\n01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:55.240\nMadam, you understand that if I were to betray one of my sworn brothers, five lightning\n\n01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:57.240\nbolts would have to kill me.\n\n01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:00.240\nI take out 500 more Nuiyan.\n\n01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:05.240\nYou realize that if I accept a bribe from someone outside of the triads, myriads of knives\n\n01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:07.240\nwill be forced to kill me.\n\n01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:10.240\nCan we just threaten this guy?\n\n01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:11.240\nWait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:15.240\nIn the recap they said that Dr. Friend invaded his brain.\n\n01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:16.240\nYeah, you did somebody?\n\n01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:17.240\nYeah, we...\n\n01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:24.240\nI think I know this guy and I hope there aren't any cyberware here because I hate them.\n\n01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:25.240\nNice.\n\n01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:30.240\nThey disgust me and I think they're less than people who are not cyberware.\n\n01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:31.240\nAll right.\n\n01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:32.240\nAll right.\n\n01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:34.240\nDr. Friend, come on.\n\n01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:39.240\nI approach the bouncer and I say hey, I'm Dr. Friend.\n\n01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:41.240\nI might be on the list and I know...\n\n01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:43.240\nWe already got to ask the bouncer.\n\n01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:45.240\nWell, we all keep going back to the bouncer.\n\n01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:49.240\nLet me handle this.\n\n01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:53.240\nI approach somebody near the front who looks like they know what's going on but they're\n\n01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:57.240\nnot bouncing and I say, hi, I know David McChinaman.\n\n01:58:57.240 --> 01:59:01.240\nMy name is Dr. Friend, but I'm not sure where in the establishment they are.\n\n01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:04.240\nIt's very red and smoky and regular smoky at the same time.\n\n01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:06.240\nCould you point me in the right direction?\n\n01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:08.240\nDavid usually hangs out by the bathrooms.\n\n01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:09.240\nYou know, you should recognize them.\n\n01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.240\nOf course.\n\n01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:11.240\nYou're friends.\n\n01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:12.240\nI should have remembered that.\n\n01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:13.240\nThank you.\n\n01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:14.240\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:15.240\nThank you very much.\n\n01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:16.240\nI think we should head to the bathroom.\n\n01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.240\nOkay, let's go to the bathroom.\n\n01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:18.240\nIf shit goes down, you're first.\n\n01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:19.240\nWhat?\n\n01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:21.240\nI said I'll take a run.\n\n01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:22.240\nI have to.\n\n01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:23.240\nOkay.\n\n01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:24.240\nHey, hey, hey.\n\n01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:30.240\nI think, what are you, can't you scan the room for this guy or something?\n\n01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:32.240\nWe know he's by the bathroom.\n\n01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:34.240\nYeah, but do you know what he looks like?\n\n01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:36.240\nYeah, I guess I do.\n\n01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:37.240\nI know him.\n\n01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:38.240\nBut hold on, I get it.\n\n01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:39.240\nDo you want to scan the room?\n\n01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:41.240\nI mean, that's what the recap said.\n\n01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:42.240\nOkay.\n\n01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:43.240\nI mean, yes.\n\n01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:45.240\nI assume I have scanning abilities.\n\n01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:49.240\nYeah, you can scan for the presence of human life.\n\n01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:50.240\nOkay.\n\n01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:52.240\nWhich is not helpful.\n\n01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:53.240\nWhich is filling.\n\n01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:54.240\nI can do that.\n\n01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:55.240\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:56.240\nIt's true.\n\n01:59:56.240 --> 02:00:00.240\nSo I scan the room and have determined that the club is filled with human life.\n\n02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:01.240\nYeah.\n\n02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:02.240\nCome

bathroom.\n\n02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:09.240\nAll right, I scan the bathroom and I find...\n\n02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:10.240\nDon't scan the...\n\n02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:11.240\nDon't scan the bathroom?\n\n02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:13.240\nWhat are you, cyberware?\n\n02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:14.240\nNo, don't...\n\n02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:15.240\nNo.\n\n02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:16.240\nHe hates

very confused right now, both by what's happening and by why this world is so Asian.\n\n02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:25.240\nOkay?\n\n02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:28.240\nI mean, come on.\n\n02:00:28.240 -->

so...\n\n02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:35.240\nAll right.\n\n02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:36.240\nRight by the bathroom.\n\n02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:37.240\nAll right.\n\n02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:38.240\nDr. Friend,

02:01:47.240\nGem, yeah.\n\n02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:50.240\nSorry for the momentary muttering.\n\n02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:52.240\nBut do you know where...\n\n02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:53.240\nSorry, just

02:01:58.240\nShe was turned into a...\n\n02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:00.240\nShe's kind of turned into a ghoul.\n\n02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:03.240\nWe have to find out where she is to get her back to her parents.\n\n02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:05.240\nAll right, I'm turning my AR back on.\n\n02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:08.240\nHe couldn't hear any of that stuff on the AR.\n\n02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:10.240\nDo

screaming.\n\n02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:41.240\nHe's like, ah, my mind.\n\n02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:43.240\nEveryone has such a horrible memory.\n\n02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:46.240\nHe just keeps scanning everybody.\n\n02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:50.240\nWe're going to wave the red dust in the air so you can keep scanning.\n\n02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.240\nThat's a hologram, that dust.\n\n02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:55.240\nI'm scanning everybody and then I accidentally scan Mercy.\n\n02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.240\nAll right.\n\n02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:58.240\nOh, man.\n\n02:04:58.240 --> 02:04:59.240\nOh,

sorry.\n\n02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:05.240\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:08.240\nShe didn't give her consent to be scanned.\n\n02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:09.240\nThat's true.\n\n02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:15.240\nI said to David McChime, hey, look, we came here hoping to find out some information.\n\n02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:16.240\nWe'll make it worth your while.\n\n02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:21.240\nIf you can give us a lead on this, this Peggy has a daughter named Gem we're looking for\n\n02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:26.240\nand the flesh to fresh franchise just keep disappearing and the

stuff.\n\n02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:33.240\nMr. McChineman.\n\n02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:34.240\nWell.\n\n02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:36.240\nIf that is your real name.\n\n02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:38.240\nI got to take him in.\n\n02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:39.240\nI got to be honest with you.\n\n02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:40.240\nHe's breathing heavily.\n\n02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:42.240\nHe seems a little worse for wear.\n\n02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:45.240\nThis is the other security guard.\n\n02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:48.240\nThe other five security guards haven't haven't left.\n\n02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.240\nThey're just standing around you guys.\n\n02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:53.240\nBut they don't seem like they're going to do anything.\n\n02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:54.240\nOkay.\n\n02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:55.240\nYou guys are right.\n\n02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:56.240\nI'm pain.\n\n02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:58.240\nI'm going to put my glasses on.\n\n02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:00.240\nWhy are you in pain?\n\n02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:02.240\nBecause I got my mind probed.\n\n02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:03.240\nWhat?\n\n02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:04.240\nYeah.\n\n02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:05.240\nJessica probed

02:06:17.240\nSorry about that.\n\n02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:18.240\nYou're a being probed.\n\n02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:19.240\nAlright.\n\n02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:20.240\nSo a couple

here.\n\n02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:27.240\nLike this is someplace that we can't.\n\n02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:28.240\nDidn't we think that the mob would know something about the\n\n02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:29.240\ndisappearance?\n\n02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:30.240\nWe didn't think that.\n\n02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:32.240\nBut like it wasn't again, we're just bad shadow runners.\n\n02:06:32.240 -->
