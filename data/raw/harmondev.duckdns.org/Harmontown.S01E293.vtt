{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:11.320\nI just look behind me and what we're the fuck are we somewhere in the middle of outer space\n\n00:11.320 --> 00:25.120\nor in the leafy groves of Long Island New York from the fantabulous cradle of aviation\n\n00:25.120 --> 00:35.520\nMuseum here in Long Island Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:35.520 --> 00:40.600\nHe at the National Treasure would you please welcome into the cosmos of your mind the Game\n\n00:40.600 --> 00:53.040\nMaster Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:53.040 --> 00:54.920\nThank you, thank you.\n\n00:54.920 --> 00:55.920\nWhat's up Spencer?\n\n00:55.920 --> 00:58.840\nI don't know man, what's up with you?\n\n00:58.840 --> 00:59.840\nNot too much.\n\n00:59.840 --> 01:01.840\nThere's one other thing I forgot to mention.\n\n01:01.840 --> 01:02.840\nUh oh.\n\n01:02.840 --> 01:07.920\ncareening to the cosmic vapor of invention that is the beautiful realm of dark matter\n\n01:07.920 --> 01:14.360\nand light matter combined together to stretch and expand your mind and space time itself.\n\n01:14.360 --> 01:30.960\nPlease put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.wn.\n\n01:30.960 --> 01:38.160\nHello universe.\n\n01:38.160 --> 01:41.560\nHello Milky Way.\n\n01:41.560 --> 01:42.560\nThank you, thank you.\n\n01:42.560 --> 01:43.560\nWow.\n\n01:43.560 --> 01:46.520\nThere's one guy yelling out that I looked.\n\n01:46.520 --> 01:48.080\nYour way loss worked.\n\n01:48.080 --> 01:49.080\nYeah.\n\n01:49.080 --> 01:52.160\nI'm not insulting you, just repeating.\n\n01:52.160 --> 01:58.200\nIt's something that I need to hear after a couple days of pizza and stuff.\n\n01:58.200 --> 02:02.720\nI mean you did look thin but then again against the backdrop of all time and space.\n\n02:02.720 --> 02:03.720\nOh yeah.\n\n02:03.720 --> 02:06.840\nEverybody looks thin against the interior cosmos.\n\n02:06.840 --> 02:09.800\nLight is actually bending around Dan right now, it makes him look smaller.\n\n02:09.800 --> 02:13.240\nWhy do you think Neil deGrasse Tyson picked this light at work?\n\n02:13.240 --> 02:19.240\nI mean the guy's a little thick in the caboose, so he wants to stand next to Charizard.\n\n02:19.240 --> 02:22.440\nYeah exactly.\n\n02:22.440 --> 02:27.520\nEverybody's sitting next to a horse head nebula.\n\n02:27.520 --> 02:32.040\nWell thanks for coming and I doubt that you guys have probably been at a convention all\n\n02:32.040 --> 02:34.040\nday today most of you, right?\n\n02:34.040 --> 02:40.160\nAnd I think a lot of the folks here stood in line for a while, we're at the signing.\n\n02:40.160 --> 02:41.160\nToo long.\n\n02:41.160 --> 02:42.160\nYeah.\n\n02:42.160 --> 02:43.160\nThank you so much.\n\n02:43.160 --> 02:48.320\nWe've got a house full of dedicated fans and for those who are listening to this later,\n\n02:48.320 --> 02:55.720\nand it's this virtually vertical raked planetarium that we're in.\n\n02:55.720 --> 03:00.920\nIt's like an IMAX except it's just three dudes.\n\n03:00.920 --> 03:06.640\nIt's a wall of people, like the people in the second row are only a little bit behind\n\n03:06.640 --> 03:10.080\nthe people in the first row, they're mostly above them.\n\n03:10.080 --> 03:14.960\nSo it's sort of like you could climb their faces.\n\n03:14.960 --> 03:18.960\nIs it possible to fire up the planetarium so we can have like the Pleiades and shit\n\n03:18.960 --> 03:19.960\nbehind us?\n\n03:19.960 --> 03:26.480\nI mean, I'm almost certainly interest, no, but I just like, because behind us for the\n\n03:26.480 --> 03:34.880\nlistener that there is just this giant, like yeah, empty void, it's pretty groovy.\n\n03:34.880 --> 03:45.160\nYeah, I don't think, I don't think, I don't think spontaneous nation.\n\n03:45.160 --> 03:46.160\nYou want a drink, Dan?\n\n03:46.160 --> 03:47.160\nYeah.\n\n03:47.160 --> 03:50.800\nWhy don't you talk and I'll conjure up a cocktail for you.\n\n03:50.800 --> 03:52.040\nOh, okay.\n\n03:52.040 --> 03:53.040\nThat's teamwork.\n\n03:53.040 --> 03:55.760\nThis is the partnership.\n\n03:55.760 --> 04:03.160\nIn the beginning, as you know, there was there was nothing, which means there was no time,\n\n04:03.160 --> 04:09.040\nwhich means that there was infinite time, which means there was 100% chance of anything\n\n04:09.040 --> 04:14.680\nhappening, including a whole universe, which was spontaneously brought into existence in\n\n04:14.680 --> 04:23.160\nthe form of a tiny particle, exactly the density of infinity, which then exploded into everything.\n\n04:23.160 --> 04:28.280\nAnd will one day either collapse or suck back in on itself.\n\n04:28.280 --> 04:35.960\nAnd in the meantime, here we are for our brief few frames in a very, very high speed camera\n\n04:35.960 --> 04:41.120\nshot of an explosion that is lasting 80 trillion years.\n\n04:41.120 --> 04:45.760\nAnd in that giant, vast expanse of what we consider time, some of us have chosen to\n\n04:45.760 --> 04:49.000\ndress like Deadpool for the evening.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:54.520\nThat's how big this explosion is, is that a one new way is giving me Miami flashbacks\n\n04:54.520 --> 04:55.520\nthough.\n\n04:55.520 --> 05:01.800\nI remember we were talking about Deadpool when someone leapt from the audience and punched.\n\n05:01.800 --> 05:04.200\nI don't think this is that kind of crowd.\n\n05:04.200 --> 05:08.960\nI think if you guys had reached the point of your psychosis, I didn't think it was that\n\n05:08.960 --> 05:12.960\nkind of crowd until like 20 people were like, no, no, not at all.\n\n05:12.960 --> 05:14.960\nThat's not me.\n\n05:14.960 --> 05:23.240\nWell, come on, these are these are planetarium folk, they're triggered by people behind desks\n\n05:23.240 --> 05:27.720\nquestioning their sanity, like that's the guidance counselors and things like it.\n\n05:27.720 --> 05:31.840\nThe difference between being held back in third grade and being moved up to sixth grade\n\n05:31.840 --> 05:38.840\nis like whether the principal's IQ is 90 or 95, right?\n\n05:38.840 --> 05:43.000\nMy mom often told me this story, she's like, they wanted to hold you back in kindergarten.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:44.720\nLike I had to go and yell at the principal.\n\n05:44.720 --> 05:48.360\nThe principal was like, he's like, he can't walk on a balance beam.\n\n05:48.360 --> 05:51.320\nShe's like, he can read college textbooks.\n\n05:51.320 --> 05:53.560\nHe's like, he can't use scissors.\n\n05:53.560 --> 05:58.720\nShe's like, what is this like, what is the society he's going to enter where he's going\n\n05:58.720 --> 06:07.440\nto like walk down a log and and and wrap everyone's Christmas gifts, but but but and illiteracy\n\n06:07.440 --> 06:08.720\nwould be fine for that.\n\n06:08.720 --> 06:11.840\nBut like, like, like, you just put him in first grade, he'll be fine.\n\n06:11.840 --> 06:15.560\nHow many balance beams are waiting for him out there in the world?\n\n06:15.560 --> 06:18.240\nI am pretty bad at balancing and using scissors.\n\n06:18.240 --> 06:22.440\nI couldn't tie my shoes, couldn't tell time, very bad at math.\n\n06:22.440 --> 06:27.800\nBut yeah, boy, boy, howdy, could I read?\n\n06:27.800 --> 06:31.000\nJust like you guys, right?\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:35.640\nDo we got any literates in the house?\n\n06:35.640 --> 06:38.240\nWhere my illiterates at?\n\n06:38.240 --> 06:43.680\nWhere's my dyslexia?\n\n06:43.680 --> 06:44.680\nPretty evenly dispersed.\n\n06:44.680 --> 06:45.680\nThat's good.\n\n06:45.680 --> 06:46.680\nYeah.\n\n06:46.680 --> 06:48.520\nYeah, exactly three, three thirds.\n\n06:48.520 --> 06:50.440\nI had a forgive my energy.\n\n06:50.440 --> 06:55.960\nI had I'm in Long Island, so I had a Long Island iced tea and dinner and what you actually\n\n06:55.960 --> 06:56.960\ndid.\n\n06:56.960 --> 06:57.960\nYeah.\n\n06:57.960 --> 07:04.480\nFor those who don't know how to make a Long Island iced tea, you take a 16 year old in\n\n07:04.480 --> 07:05.960\ntheir parents kitchen.\n\n07:05.960 --> 07:08.880\nWell, the parents are out of town.\n\n07:08.880 --> 07:14.760\nYou open the cupboard and you pour whatever's in there because you don't want any of the\n\n07:14.760 --> 07:17.640\nbottles to reveal that you took any of them.\n\n07:17.640 --> 07:23.040\nSo then you end up with a full cup of every liquor in the cabinet and that's a Long Island\n\n07:23.040 --> 07:24.280\niced tea.\n\n07:24.280 --> 07:30.640\nYou tend to drink them when you're younger because you know how to order them.\n\n07:30.640 --> 07:32.240\nIt's like you can't get that words wrong.\n\n07:32.240 --> 07:36.960\nNo one's going to go, you're not 21 the way you said Long Island iced tea.\n\n07:36.960 --> 07:40.320\nYou must be a bachelorette.\n\n07:40.320 --> 07:43.640\nOne Long Island iced tea coming up.\n\n07:43.640 --> 07:47.480\nThe Long Island, of course, is not that long.\n\n07:47.480 --> 07:51.080\nThis is a Viking, goes back to Viking times.\n\n07:51.080 --> 07:57.120\nPeople that didn't want the Vikings to find Long Island would tell them it's very Long\n\n07:57.120 --> 07:58.120\nIsland.\n\n07:58.120 --> 07:59.120\nYou can't miss it.\n\n07:59.120 --> 08:05.160\nJust, of course, hoping that the Vikings would end up in New Jersey, which they did.\n\n08:05.160 --> 08:06.400\nI don't know anything about geography.\n\n08:06.400 --> 08:07.400\nAnd they had long boats.\n\n08:07.400 --> 08:08.400\nYeah.\n\n08:08.400 --> 08:09.880\nYou'd think that that would have worked out.\n\n08:09.880 --> 08:13.080\nThey're like, are you sure we shouldn't be really precise in our aiming toward Long\n\n08:13.080 --> 08:14.080\nIsland?\n\n08:14.080 --> 08:15.080\nNo, you don't.\n\n08:15.080 --> 08:16.080\nJust go wide.\n\n08:16.080 --> 08:17.080\nIt's a Long Island.\n\n08:17.080 --> 08:18.080\nIt's not that long.\n\n08:18.080 --> 08:27.520\nIt's just a very crafty, pre-Cambrian Atlanteans that wanted to protect Long Island and its\n\n08:27.520 --> 08:28.520\nculture.\n\n08:28.520 --> 08:32.560\nWe're in Nassau County, am I correct?\n\n08:32.560 --> 08:33.560\nYeah.\n\n08:33.560 --> 08:38.160\nNassau is a Native American word meaning rich white people.\n\n08:38.160 --> 08:41.720\nIt hurts.\n\n08:41.720 --> 08:43.640\nPeople don't know that.\n\n08:43.640 --> 08:47.720\nYou guys came here for the fucking truth, and that's what you're going to get tonight.\n\n08:47.720 --> 08:48.720\nYeah.\n\n08:48.720 --> 08:56.240\nI mean, matter can't exist in the same place, and you have privilege.\n\n08:56.240 --> 08:58.240\nIt's all saying science.\n\n08:58.240 --> 08:59.240\nExactly.\n\n08:59.240 --> 09:00.240\nYeah.\n\n09:00.240 --> 09:01.240\nTruth is truth.\n\n09:01.240 --> 09:02.240\nYou can't just take the parts you like.\n\n09:02.240 --> 09:03.240\nI thought you were joking.\n\n09:03.240 --> 09:05.240\nLook, that was a lot of emails to be deleted.\n\n09:05.240 --> 09:08.800\nI thought you were joking at dinner about the Long Island ST.\n\n09:08.800 --> 09:10.400\nI thought you were just musing what you actually are.\n\n09:10.400 --> 09:12.960\nYeah, because I talked about it so much, I was like, well, of course, the Long Island\n\n09:12.960 --> 09:17.280\nST is out on the menu, and I was like, oh, Long Island STs, and as I was explaining how\n\n09:17.280 --> 09:22.840\nmuch I would never drink one again, it kind of made me nostalgic.\n\n09:22.840 --> 09:25.200\nYou talk about a drink long enough to get an order one.\n\n09:25.200 --> 09:26.200\nDo they make them better here?\n\n09:26.200 --> 09:27.600\nDo you think this is like...\n\n09:27.600 --> 09:33.120\nI tasted like the same kind of beverage that I remember from 20 years ago.\n\n09:33.120 --> 09:35.520\nYou know, it's a long...\n\n09:35.520 --> 09:36.520\nYeah.\n\n09:36.520 --> 09:37.520\nI didn't finish it.\n\n09:37.520 --> 09:46.680\nI'll have a pretty bad hangover tomorrow, but I tried to, man, I don't want to be anticlimactic\n\n09:46.680 --> 09:53.920\nwith it, because I was trying on the plane, I was trying to write a Long Island song.\n\n09:53.920 --> 09:59.200\nWhen we were in Boston, Dan wrote a Boston song, and it was listening to the episode.\n\n09:59.200 --> 10:00.200\nIt was good.\n\n10:00.200 --> 10:02.120\nIt was acapella, but this time, and I had, like...\n\n10:02.120 --> 10:07.840\nBut you actually concocted the...\n\n10:07.840 --> 10:10.640\nYeah, that's why I was like...\n\n10:10.640 --> 10:13.640\nIt's more of an emotional thing, isn't it?\n\n10:13.640 --> 10:16.800\nLong Island, rest your weary head...\n\n10:16.800 --> 10:20.800\nWait, no, wait, sorry about that.\n\n10:20.800 --> 10:25.200\nLong Island, rest your weary face...\n\n10:25.200 --> 10:28.200\nIt's too long for too long now...\n\n10:28.200 --> 10:37.200\nLong Island, you're in outer space, it's just a song for Long Island, Long Island be with\n\n10:37.200 --> 10:53.720\nme, Long Island take a pee, Long Island frolic in costume, while you wait in line, Long Island,\n\n10:53.720 --> 11:03.360\nhow long will you wait to be a part of the country, and not just an island, to me you're\n\n11:03.360 --> 11:18.040\na peninsula, Long Island I love you, Long Island are you, really that long at all, winter,\n\n11:18.040 --> 11:32.120\nspring, summer, fall, give me a call, new phone, who dis, all right.\n\n11:32.120 --> 11:36.440\nSome of that I wrote just now.\n\n11:36.440 --> 11:40.560\nWho's up there on light effects, because that was pretty special, because that was like the\n\n11:40.560 --> 11:44.640\nencore of a journey concert.\n\n11:44.640 --> 11:51.560\nI want to plug the app that I use there, because it only seems fair, but also I kind of don't\n\n11:51.560 --> 11:56.200\nwant to, because it feels like it's my secret weapon with songwriting, it's called Chordbot,\n\n11:56.200 --> 12:04.640\nit's a really good app, if you're not musically trained, but you only know, oh, I need chords\n\n12:04.640 --> 12:12.200\nand I need to know which chords work together, and it's a cool app, you can quickly move\n\n12:12.200 --> 12:14.320\nchords around and hear if they work together.\n\n12:14.320 --> 12:17.880\nSo was that whole song in that, or did you make chords and then move them into a garage\n\n12:17.880 --> 12:18.880\nband or something?\n\n12:18.880 --> 12:23.440\nThat was just Chordbot doing it, you can be very simple, you can just play tones, and\n\n12:23.440 --> 12:29.320\nyou can, it's got enough sophistication, did you make that sound because you're exhausted,\n\n12:29.320 --> 12:31.320\nyou just hate that.\n\n12:31.320 --> 12:42.720\nSorry, that's the lead programmer on GarageBand, it's going to be a long day at work tomorrow.\n\n12:42.720 --> 12:45.600\nThis is Chordbot we're hearing about from the Long Island District.\n\n12:45.600 --> 12:49.280\nYou had one job last night.\n\n12:49.280 --> 12:54.720\nKeep harming on GarageBand, it's just harder, I imagine GarageBand is probably a lot easier\n\n12:54.720 --> 12:59.440\nfor people that actually understand music, but like GarageBand you have to like poke\n\n12:59.440 --> 13:05.320\nand swipe and poop around in order to just say, well what if this was an A-sharp instead\n\n13:05.320 --> 13:12.280\nof an A-flat, yeah, that's a bad app.\n\n13:12.280 --> 13:19.400\nI work at Apple, I quit working for Dan, I went back to Apple.\n\n13:19.400 --> 13:25.920\nLet's see if I have any, what if I lost you and then I found you there, I come into the\n\n13:25.920 --> 13:34.320\nApple store and I'm like, can we help you, I'm like, yeah, I have a broken friendship.\n\n13:34.320 --> 13:36.520\nDid you make an appointment?\n\n13:36.520 --> 13:44.160\nYeah, I thought I did, but it turns out maybe it's expensive, and it's just like muscle\n\n13:44.160 --> 13:50.080\nthrough and they're like, security's coming and then you're like, it's alright, it's fine,\n\n13:50.080 --> 13:53.360\nhe has an appointment.\n\n13:53.360 --> 13:56.720\nAt the emotional genius bar.\n\n13:56.720 --> 14:11.320\nNo, it's Dan, yeah, let's see, I'm just looking for, this is song fragments, Long Island up\n\n14:11.320 --> 14:22.560\nand down, Long Island come to town, Long Island singer song, Long Island make your island\n\n14:22.560 --> 14:32.000\nlong, I remember when I was a kid, I was briefly living in Manhattan and a friend of mine lived\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:36.680\nsomewhere in Nassau County and it was 4th of July and we had all these sparklers and\n\n14:36.680 --> 14:42.000\nlike smoke bombs and like kind of low grade fireworks and we went, like the parents were\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:46.480\ndoing their thing and getting drunk and making food and stuff, so me and my friend Luke,\n\n14:46.480 --> 14:54.240\nno not Luke, David, we were, doesn't matter, you don't fucking know him, and we went, there\n\n14:54.240 --> 14:59.920\nwas a telephone pole and it was like giant ants were living inside it, there's little\n\n14:59.920 --> 15:04.920\nfissures and cracks inside old telephone poles, they're kind of tarred and whatnot and there's\n\n15:04.920 --> 15:08.920\nthese big ants living inside it, moving around, so we started sticking smoke bombs in there\n\n15:08.920 --> 15:13.160\nand there's like all these ants would come out and so we thought that was really fascinating\n\n15:13.160 --> 15:18.920\nand so we kept doing it to see like what ecosystem existed inside this telephone pole and then\n\n15:18.920 --> 15:24.720\nit caught on fire, so we caught a hole, we caught a hole and it's made of tar, yeah it's\n\n15:24.720 --> 15:30.440\ngot all that oil in it, so the fire department had a real tough time on that one, cause you\n\n15:30.440 --> 15:33.280\nguys were like, well it's not a fire bomb, it's a smoke bomb, they're like, how do you\n\n15:33.280 --> 15:42.440\nthink you make smoke, there's fire in the bomb, stuck it in a big piece of wood and ants,\n\n15:42.440 --> 15:46.320\nthat's like how they used to really make fire before, I think me and my friend, we just\n\n15:46.320 --> 15:51.760\nhid in the bush and took no credit for it, cowardly, yeah I told them, me and my friend\n\n15:51.760 --> 15:59.600\nDan Ramstack, we made a, when we were like 10 years old, we took batteries and light\n\n15:59.600 --> 16:04.680\nbulbs and we like made this like blinky thing with electrical tape that we, I don't think,\n\n16:04.680 --> 16:08.200\nI don't know if we wanted it to look like a bomb, I really don't, I think we wanted\n\n16:08.200 --> 16:14.120\nit to just look like a crazy sci-fi thing and we like taped it to the screen door of\n\n16:14.120 --> 16:19.800\na girl that lived in the neighborhood, I guess that was our way of saying, I love you, we\n\n16:19.800 --> 16:27.040\nwould like to kiss you one day, here's a blinky device, but her father came to the door and\n\n16:27.040 --> 16:30.640\ncalled the bomb squad, or I got called the police and they called the bomb squad and\n\n16:30.640 --> 16:39.080\nthey were like people everywhere, flashlights and assault rifles and pliers and we just\n\n16:39.080 --> 16:46.760\nsat at a swing porch and watched and my mom was like, did you guys, no, I mean like what\n\n16:46.760 --> 16:51.840\nare we supposed to do, say yes, like we're gonna get more than beaten, we're gonna get\n\n16:51.840 --> 16:58.160\nshot, like these people, it wasn't our idea that Johnny Gove would get involved, she just\n\n16:58.160 --> 17:07.800\nwanted a kiss, just wanted to, just wanted to call in the bomb threat of affection, this\n\n17:07.800 --> 17:13.960\nwas before me too, it was a perfectly acceptable way to call upon a young lady, she plant a\n\n17:13.960 --> 17:21.560\nbomb on her father's door, back in the late 70s, early 80s, nothing said, will you be\n\n17:21.560 --> 17:26.880\nmine, these days it's so complicated, like are you supposed to use a Molotov cocktail\n\n17:26.880 --> 17:31.840\nor like, what happened to romance, the flashbang, we used to go, I don't know, I want to do\n\n17:31.840 --> 17:36.920\nwhat the right thing is, but I'm trying my best, I just, I don't know what it is anymore,\n\n17:36.920 --> 17:45.080\nI'm sorry, I feel like we've talked about in the very early days of Harmontown of colonizing\n\n17:45.080 --> 17:48.440\nthe moon, I think this is the closest that we've gotten, we're here in the planetarium,\n\n17:48.440 --> 17:59.040\nwe were on the moon, yeah, stars, that's the problem, the lights are washing out the\n\n17:59.040 --> 18:05.760\nplanetarium, can we kill the side lights, that'd be bad for our subscribers, that sounds\n\n18:05.760 --> 18:35.600\nlike a distraction, we can't see up there, Jesus, we can't see, from a distant nebula,\n\n18:35.600 --> 19:04.440\noh Jesus Christ, what happened, I can't see anything, just a giant trash can, are you\n\n19:04.440 --> 19:20.440\nokay, Rob Schrab, all right, well again, I was going to bring you up, I had a thing\n\n19:20.440 --> 19:27.280\nkind of planned out, it didn't work, did you fall down the stairs, because it sounded like\n\n19:27.280 --> 19:37.600\nyou did and I only saw darkness, a giant trash can came down this 70 degree slope, Rob on\n\n19:37.600 --> 19:43.680\nsound here, he got completely splashed by just miscellaneous liquids, I thought there\n\n19:43.680 --> 19:49.600\nwould be tape on the stairs, I didn't want to expect, no offense, but I thought Rob was\n\n19:49.600 --> 19:59.480\nRob, Rob, will you stand up for a second and just, don't touch him, don't touch him,\n\n19:59.480 --> 20:04.440\nwhat did we tell you about matter, what did time come, you want this whole place to go\n\n20:04.440 --> 20:11.800\ntime cop, oh man, now I had, I mean like, they didn't have my lab, I tried to go for\n\n20:11.800 --> 20:20.360\nit, it was supposed to be big, a beautiful star, God 25 years, didn't work out the way\n\n20:20.360 --> 20:24.080\nI planned it, I'm really sorry, I'm sorry you got splashed, but you made the stars happen\n\n20:24.080 --> 20:28.160\nthough, was that part of your, yeah, that was just the beginning of it, it only got better\n\n20:28.160 --> 20:33.360\nafter that, I tripped and I fell down and I hit, so you did fall down the stairs, well\n\n20:33.360 --> 20:37.760\nI hurt, yeah I hurt myself if you're curious, yeah I was, I asked if you're okay and you\n\n20:37.760 --> 20:43.400\njust stared off into space, I hit my head a couple of times, great damage, I'm so sorry,\n\n20:43.400 --> 20:48.760\ndon't you already have like a hairline fracture all the way down your skull from when you\n\n20:48.760 --> 20:54.560\nsaw Teen Wolf when you were in college and tried to do a stand stand on the top of a\n\n20:54.560 --> 21:02.400\nmoving car, yes, when I was, when I was, when I was in high school, when I was in high\n\n21:02.400 --> 21:12.600\nschool, we watched Teen Wolf, I wrote that, I wrote that movie, in the, in the theater\n\n21:12.600 --> 21:17.680\nand then we went, wow that looks like cool, not turning into a wolf but, or playing basketball\n\n21:17.680 --> 21:22.680\nbut, turning into a wolf just seems like a path to growth, yeah, it seems like you'll\n\n21:22.680 --> 21:25.880\njust learn you don't want to turn into a wolf as much as you want to respect your friends,\n\n21:25.880 --> 21:30.560\nyeah so we, this car surfing thing however, car surfing thing, this is really going to\n\n21:30.560 --> 21:37.400\ntake off, so Corey Yacht is Dan Calo and myself started driving, Dan Calo's car, driving,\n\n21:37.400 --> 21:42.000\ndriving down Mabel like back roads and stuff where there was no like lights or anything\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:48.560\nas a farm area and Corey goes on first and he's like, yeah, well, I feel I'm the top\n\n21:48.560 --> 21:53.000\nof the world, yeah, king of the world, you know, and then, and then, and then he goes,\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:58.360\nokay, sure, but it's your turn and then as he gets off he goes, dude, when the car stops,\n\n21:58.360 --> 22:04.400\npretend like you're falling off, it'll freak out Dan Calo who's driving the car and so\n\n22:04.400 --> 22:08.600\nI'm like, yeah, king of the world and then Dan Calo comes to a stop and then every single\n\n22:08.600 --> 22:15.360\nthing went black and I woke up three hours later in Dan Calo's living room with Corey\n\n22:15.360 --> 22:23.000\nholding like a, like a, like a wad of newspaper and it was like blood and, and he goes, what\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:27.120\ndo you want, are you okay, do you want to go to the hospital, no, I just want to go home\n\n22:27.120 --> 22:34.080\nand go to sleep and they went, well, okay, it's either this or this are getting in trouble\n\n22:34.080 --> 22:41.000\nand they put me in a bed and I fell asleep with a huge concussion, but my skull was cracked.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:47.200\nYeah, empathy is, is I think a learned trait, like, I don't think kids, kids are sociopaths\n\n22:47.200 --> 22:50.240\nbecause they might be Spartans, you know, like they don't know, like the human being\n\n22:50.240 --> 22:54.560\nis designed to adapt to whatever society they're going to be and as the human society's moral\n\n22:54.560 --> 22:59.520\ncompass might be based on the complete dispensability of human life.\n\n22:59.520 --> 23:00.520\nYes.\n\n23:00.520 --> 23:04.120\nWell, everybody's so afraid of getting into trouble and getting yelled at that you're\n\n23:04.120 --> 23:09.600\nwilling to let one of your friends go to sleep and wake up not breathing.\n\n23:09.600 --> 23:15.960\nWe had, we had a treehouse in Stan Frankie's backyard when I was in Milwaukee and uh, Stan\n\n23:15.960 --> 23:16.960\nFrankie.\n\n23:16.960 --> 23:20.600\nYou had, you had Stan Frankie, I had Warren, you had Stan Frankie, I had Warren Stanky.\n\n23:20.600 --> 23:21.600\nRight.\n\n23:21.600 --> 23:24.920\nSo, we're sitting in Stan Frankie's treehouse.\n\n23:24.920 --> 23:25.920\nWarren Stanky, Warren Stanky.\n\n23:25.920 --> 23:26.920\nMy favorite fuck band.\n\n23:26.920 --> 23:28.520\nAnd Dave Bublitz comes over.\n\n23:28.520 --> 23:29.520\nDave Bublitz.\n\n23:29.520 --> 23:30.520\nDave Bublitz.\n\n23:30.520 --> 23:31.520\nDave Bublitz, everybody.\n\n23:31.520 --> 23:32.520\nFor your consideration.\n\n23:32.520 --> 23:37.080\nHe's from around the way, you know, he lives all the way up Calumet, like, he's like a different\n\n23:37.080 --> 23:41.720\nclick, you know, he wasn't like one of our Stranger Things tribe, he was like an ancillary\n\n23:41.720 --> 23:46.640\ncharacter and so he made a convenient, like, oh, let's not leave, let's not let Dave Bublitz\n\n23:46.640 --> 23:52.640\nup the tree and we're, and we're like Dave Bublitz, you can't come, he's like, I want\n\n23:52.640 --> 23:53.640\nto come up there.\n\n23:53.640 --> 23:54.640\nI want to come be up in your treehouse.\n\n23:54.640 --> 23:59.400\nWe're like, you're not, you're not 52nd Street material.\n\n23:59.400 --> 24:00.400\nThis is our plywood.\n\n24:00.400 --> 24:05.120\nThis is our tree and uh, and he's like, I'm coming up and we're like, suit yourself.\n\n24:05.120 --> 24:10.240\nAnd I don't, it was like, we, I, this is where it gets sketchy because it's like, I don't\n\n24:10.240 --> 24:13.840\nknow if, okay, it's 9-11.\n\n24:13.840 --> 24:14.840\nIt's 9-11.\n\n24:14.840 --> 24:22.400\nI'm telling you the story of Dave Bublitz is 9-11, uh, unless he grew up and became\n\n24:22.400 --> 24:31.080\nof a terrorist New York, uh, investor, but, but, uh, don't groan when after you shout\n\n24:31.080 --> 24:37.040\nout 9-11 in the middle of my story, you people go, go, go get your own moral compass.\n\n24:37.040 --> 24:40.880\nSo he's climbing up the thing and I don't know, I can't, I think I feel like when you're\n\n24:40.880 --> 24:46.320\na kid and you, you do fucked up things, like, you know, you feel so guilty that I think\n\n24:46.320 --> 24:51.680\nyou can, you whitewash, you, you, I think you alter the memory because my memory of\n\n24:51.680 --> 24:56.200\nit is that it was a total accident, like a Wiley Coyote, Rube Goldberg thing.\n\n24:56.200 --> 25:01.960\nBut I have a feeling from what I know of how evil children are that this was an intentional\n\n25:01.960 --> 25:07.000\nthing that we just didn't anticipate, like having the results that it did where there\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:13.320\nwas like a two by four up there that was like just laying and, and there was an incline\n\n25:13.320 --> 25:23.160\nand as, as Dave Bublitz, uh, forehead crested the, uh, the threshold, um, uh, coming up\n\n25:23.160 --> 25:29.480\nthat this two by four in my memory just happened to choose that time to slide, like, right\n\n25:29.480 --> 25:30.480\nfor it.\n\n25:30.480 --> 25:35.360\nBut that's, I'm, I'm like, let's be accountable and just even assume, let's blackwash if\n\n25:35.360 --> 25:40.400\nthat's the opposite of whitewashing this like history because like I, I, I bet somebody\n\n25:40.400 --> 25:48.240\nwas like, you know, like, like, and this two by four slid and it, and it, and it, and it\n\n25:48.240 --> 25:51.400\nhit Dave Bublitz squarely in the forehead.\n\n25:51.400 --> 25:56.120\nAnd then I remember this, like he, he had this look on his face and then I remember\n\n25:56.120 --> 26:01.080\nthis tiniest little red dot on his forehead, like immediately start getting bigger and\n\n26:01.080 --> 26:06.680\nbigger and then, and then he like fell and, and then, and then started shrieking and we\n\n26:06.680 --> 26:14.720\nall like clamber down out of the tree and, and, and, and he's like, ah, ah, ah, uh, Stan\n\n26:14.720 --> 26:15.880\ngoes into the house.\n\n26:15.880 --> 26:22.640\nHe comes out with like a lot of paper towels, um, and he hands it to Dave who like, we're\n\n26:22.640 --> 26:28.480\nall like eight years old or something and Dave like takes the paper towels and he touches\n\n26:28.480 --> 26:34.440\nthem to his forehead and then he pulls it back and he sees solid red paper towel laying\n\n26:34.440 --> 26:43.200\nand he, he just goes absolutely insane and more so than he already had and, and he runs\n\n26:43.200 --> 26:49.400\nfor his dirt bike and we all instinctively just run for our dirt bikes with him and just\n\n26:49.400 --> 26:59.760\nlike give him a ineffective police escort to his home where he's just shrieking and there's\n\n26:59.760 --> 27:06.440\nlike paper towels like trailing like he's just, and we're all just like blue angels\n\n27:06.440 --> 27:15.440\nlike flanking him just like, like riding up the hill, the Calumet and then like screaming\n\n27:15.440 --> 27:20.720\nthe entire way so every, every person weed whacking is stopping their weed whacking to\n\n27:20.720 --> 27:21.720\nsee what's going on.\n\n27:21.720 --> 27:26.200\nThere's just a kid with bloody paper towels like flying behind him as he gets to his home\n\n27:26.200 --> 27:32.120\nthere's our little suburban front yards like he, he, you know, when you were a kid, you\n\n27:32.120 --> 27:36.720\njust like ditch your bike, he just, he just like gets to the front yard, ditches his bike\n\n27:36.720 --> 27:42.080\nand runs as his mom comes out into the porch and, and, and into her arms with his bloody\n\n27:42.080 --> 27:48.120\nforehead and, and, and we all just kind of like, like just kept riding just, we just,\n\n27:48.120 --> 27:57.640\nwe had one job just see him home safe permission to buzz the tower so, so you, you, you weren't\n\n27:57.640 --> 28:02.800\na part of the two by four, you, I look, I probably were, I don't, I'm telling you the\n\n28:02.800 --> 28:06.800\nhonest, somebody projected this thing towards him and kicked it at him, well what I'm telling\n\n28:06.800 --> 28:14.680\nyou is my memory of it sincerely is that the two by four just like moved like, and I'm,\n\n28:14.680 --> 28:18.920\nand I'm a 45 year old man going what is the likelihood of that, you know, like, like there\n\n28:18.920 --> 28:22.760\nwas already, that's a hat on a hat as we say in the writer's room like, like, like, like\n\n28:22.760 --> 28:30.320\nthere was already a story happening here and like we were, we had malice toward this incursion\n\n28:30.320 --> 28:37.080\nand, and so I just feel like whether, whether we thought it would, you know, like, like,\n\n28:37.080 --> 28:40.560\nour physics were based on cartoons or something, I have a feeling that we were like, well,\n\n28:40.560 --> 28:46.800\nlet's just do this as he comes up, you know, like, like, I, I just, it's my 45 year old\n\n28:46.800 --> 28:54.600\nlike, like, you know, cynical suspicion and also a little bit of like middle-aged accountability\n\n28:54.600 --> 28:59.320\nlike, I'm going like, how is, how likely is it that, that, that my memory has actually\n\n28:59.320 --> 29:04.720\naltered Blade Runner style to remove accountability? Because I've told the story of this podcast\n\n29:04.720 --> 29:13.000\ntoo, like, we almost, I was like, I remember like, like, deciding to and executing the\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:18.520\nstrangulation of a friend who was like, like, like, like he was putting on his scarf, we\n\n29:18.520 --> 29:24.920\nwere like bundling up for winter and I was like, I was probably like six or seven, like,\n\n29:24.920 --> 29:31.000\nand I was like, to my friend said, look, Carl is putting on his scarf, let's go up and\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:37.480\nlet's just like, you take one end and I'll take the other and God, what? And you thought\n\n29:37.480 --> 29:41.920\nhis head would get really small and go through the knot, like some kind of Jerry, I don't\n\n29:41.920 --> 29:47.360\nknow, I swear, I don't know. I'd like, I, I know that I wasn't thinking let's murder\n\n29:47.360 --> 29:52.920\na human being, I know that I wasn't thinking that I know I was thinking like, like, like\n\n29:52.920 --> 29:58.280\nviolence is fun. Like, you know, I was thinking like, like, like he won't like it. He'll\n\n29:58.280 --> 30:09.320\nhate it. It'll be like a Mahoney on police academy screwing with the, you know, my Mauser,\n\n30:09.320 --> 30:13.240\nlike, like, this will be a real laugh. Like he'll he'll he just certainly doesn't want\n\n30:13.240 --> 30:19.200\nhis scarf much tighter than he's going to make it at his own. And, and, and, and my friend\n\n30:19.200 --> 30:25.000\nand I just would do is that it was my idea. I pitched it. He yes, they ended me. We grabbed\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:34.800\none end of the other started pulling and Carl went like, what do you do? And a teacher came\n\n30:34.800 --> 30:43.520\nby and he was going on. He was fucking purple. And, and, and, and, and you guys are pulling\n\n30:43.520 --> 30:50.680\nas hard as you can. That's my memory. Yes. Like not understanding like anything about\n\n30:50.680 --> 31:01.760\nlike, help me. Help me. And the teacher, the teacher, the teacher, the teacher was, we\n\n31:01.760 --> 31:05.120\nwere young enough that the teacher was kind of omnipresent. Like no, there was no, it\n\n31:05.120 --> 31:08.320\nwas like, it was like, we were, we could have been like first grade. I don't know how old\n\n31:08.320 --> 31:14.320\nyou are in first grade. Like, what are you six? Yeah, because it's always, you're just\n\n31:14.320 --> 31:18.280\nout of kindergarten. And it's like, you're like, so the teacher's like a mother duck\n\n31:18.280 --> 31:22.520\nand like, all the ducks are kind of like, you know, she's trying to, so she was preoccupied\n\n31:22.520 --> 31:29.880\nfor that sliver of time. And Jesus Christ did not leave kids alone. I shouldn't project\n\n31:29.880 --> 31:34.400\ndon't leave me alone as a kid. Like I maybe I'm like, I have a fucking dover gene. So\n\n31:34.400 --> 31:39.400\nI'm just kind of thinking like putting myself in this situation, I would, I would, I'm hoping\n\n31:39.400 --> 31:43.680\nthis is what I would do. This is what I would do is I would pull and go, Oh, what am I thinking\n\n31:43.680 --> 31:49.000\nand stop? But it sounds like you guys were like, kept going. Yeah. Well, we were trying\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:54.240\nto, she's like, here's what I remember happening. Like is that the is that I remember the teacher\n\n31:54.240 --> 32:03.200\ncoming over and going like, and this is the strangest thing that I mean, it's, I'd have\n\n32:03.200 --> 32:07.400\nto like pull out like an overhead of the coat room or wherever we were the foyer is just\n\n32:07.400 --> 32:10.960\nlike kids in winter coats everywhere, they're all bundling up and putting on moon boots\n\n32:10.960 --> 32:15.320\nand half of them are crying, half of them are allergic to cheese and you want to get\n\n32:15.320 --> 32:20.720\nthat there's just mass hysteria, you know, and so within this mass hysteria, like three\n\n32:20.720 --> 32:27.480\nkids are doing this like weird thing. And so I just, I think what happened is the teacher\n\n32:27.480 --> 32:33.600\nsomehow wasn't conscious of the crime that was taking place. She was only conscious of\n\n32:33.600 --> 32:42.400\nCarl dying. She I think that's just how long his scarf was that we were out of frame because\n\n32:42.400 --> 32:47.120\nit was Milwaukee and maybe his mother lovingly knit a very long doctor who scarf for him.\n\n32:47.120 --> 32:52.400\nAnd so we were just like out of the teacher's point of view. And so she was only just like\n\n32:52.400 --> 32:58.720\nher shock, the look on her face and the tone of her voice. And she's like, Carl. And that's\n\n32:58.720 --> 33:05.760\nwhat I, and I was like, Oh, and I let go. And she's like, Carl, like, like, and she like\n\n33:05.760 --> 33:13.560\nloosened the thing. And he's like, and couldn't speak. So he couldn't say these two people\n\n33:13.560 --> 33:21.480\nover here just tried to murder me. Take them to jail, call the police, like alter the course\n\n33:21.480 --> 33:28.040\nof his life. Did you did you just like, like, like, oh, man, what happened? Are you okay?\n\n33:28.040 --> 33:32.680\nWe, we, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we stepped forward and said, Oh, I want me to introduce myself.\n\n33:32.680 --> 33:40.520\nI feel somewhat responsible for this. I see you're overwhelmed, Mrs. Burr. I should stay\n\n33:40.520 --> 33:46.920\nhere. And no, we fucking backed up and walked earned and walked away and never spoke of it.\n\n33:46.920 --> 33:51.800\nNever spoke of it again. And I don't, I don't, Carl, I, I, I did improv with him in Milwaukee\n\n33:51.800 --> 33:58.200\nlater, like when we were in high school. And I was like, do you remember me almost murdering\n\n33:58.200 --> 34:02.840\nyou? I feel and he's like, No, man, I don't remember that. You want to get high?\n\n34:02.840 --> 34:07.480\nWell, you got you, you, you, and I'm like, what do you have, what do you have worked\n\n34:07.480 --> 34:13.000\nfor NASA? He was like a really cool, funny guy, like high school brain long enough for him to\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:17.960\nforget. He was like, he ended up in comedy sports and he was like the funniest guy in his high\n\n34:17.960 --> 34:22.920\nschool comedy sports team. And then like, like, and it was like really, really, like awesome dude\n\n34:22.920 --> 34:27.480\nthat everybody liked. But he kind of had this personality that was like, Oh man, all right,\n\n34:27.480 --> 34:31.480\nhe's kind of the Michael Richards of his school. And I always thought like, would you work for\n\n34:31.480 --> 34:37.240\nyou give him a partial stroke? Yeah, like, like, like, did I, did I just nudge him into comedy? Like,\n\n34:37.240 --> 34:42.520\nyou know, we're killing like a little bit of like math or something. I like, I'll have to wonder\n\n34:42.520 --> 34:47.640\nforever. But he forgave me the him that, that, that I, that I created forgave me.\n\n34:50.200 --> 34:56.600\nSo who, who, so booblets was in the treehouse trying to come up your treehouse. And I want to\n\n34:56.600 --> 35:00.440\nsay, and they're all these stories, there's other kids there. This isn't like a Tyler Jordan thing\n\n35:00.440 --> 35:06.840\nwhere I'm just murdering people. And I know their names sound made up, but these kids. So it was\n\n35:06.840 --> 35:11.400\nyou, Dan Harmon. And who was on the other end? Well, I'm not going to nail it. It's gotten into\n\n35:11.400 --> 35:16.760\nthe criminal. Well, make up the first name. What is the last name? Because it's Milwaukee. So it's\n\n35:16.760 --> 35:22.440\nsome fucked up. Oh, what are you asking? You said booblets in Ramstack? No, no, no, no, I'm just\n\n35:22.440 --> 35:27.080\nsaying who is holding the other end of the scarf. Yeah, I'm just the point of it is just like,\n\n35:27.080 --> 35:32.520\nbecause you said booblets and Ramstack and, and whatever. Stan, Stan, whose treehouse it was.\n\n35:32.520 --> 35:36.120\nStan Frankie. Well, now I feel weird about naming everyone's names.\n\n35:36.120 --> 35:40.680\nStan Frankie is responsible for the death of this child. God damn. It was my pitch.\n\n35:40.680 --> 35:46.520\nIt was your pitch. Fine. I'm just saying, like, you've noticed this. We have, like in the Midwest,\n\n35:46.520 --> 35:51.160\nwe have screwed up. My favorite name is one of Rob's friends was a girl that Rob went to school\n\n35:51.160 --> 35:57.480\nwith. Her name was Missy Popinfoose. Oh, I was hottest girl in eighth grade. But we live in\n\n35:57.480 --> 36:01.240\nthis area. I know I want to say because I like, yeah, I had this big crush on Linda Sheenbuckner\n\n36:01.240 --> 36:05.240\nin fourth grade. I like these names are great. But and you, and if you try to fake them, they're\n\n36:05.240 --> 36:09.320\nnot great. But now we live on Facebook and then people like type these names in and then it's\n\n36:09.320 --> 36:14.120\nlike, like, I don't know. I was really good friends with a guy named Brian Schrofnagel.\n\n36:14.120 --> 36:22.760\nAnd you don't, you don't think these names are weird until you meet Jeff and or come to Los\n\n36:22.760 --> 36:30.280\nAngeles. Did you guys have weird names? Anybody? Anybody? No. What's that? Tommy McGee. That's\n\n36:30.280 --> 36:36.360\nyour name. Oh, okay. Tommy McGee. elementary school. Yeah. My teacher's one of my teachers\n\n36:36.360 --> 36:42.200\nswears he has a friend named Pat Moini. Pat Moini. I had a friend named Sean Malarkey.\n\n36:42.200 --> 36:47.960\nOh, boy. How bad ass is that? I'm a larky. There was a guy that lived across the street\n\n36:48.680 --> 36:57.480\nfrom us. His name was Gordy Grepentrog. And he lived under a bridge. He was it was a name like\n\n36:57.480 --> 37:04.200\nthat? You have to be a hockey player for the island. Gordon Grepentrog. But they call the\n\n37:04.200 --> 37:09.320\nbank of Christ to pass this bridge. Well, a lot of people don't know that you changed your name.\n\n37:09.320 --> 37:13.960\nYou shortened your name for show business. Your show business. Your name is your name.\n\n37:18.200 --> 37:19.080\nAnd it didn't work.\n\n37:21.560 --> 37:24.440\nWith all the good intentions, she turned it to Richard Pryor.\n\n37:25.640 --> 37:29.640\nNot for, not for pussy. And it didn't work.\n\n37:30.840 --> 37:35.880\nAnd it didn't work. Yeah, you shortened your, your, your full last name is Schrabdude.\n\n37:35.880 --> 37:39.480\nNo, no. Whoa. All right. I thought that would get a bigger laugh. I guess.\n\n37:39.480 --> 37:43.320\nBig time. No, because it sounds possible after Schrafnagel and stuff like that.\n\n37:43.320 --> 37:47.720\nHe refers to himself as the Schrabduke sometimes. Oh yeah, the Schrabduke. Yeah.\n\n37:47.720 --> 37:54.440\nAll right. Well, anyways, names are stupid. Yeah. Like, was Tommy McFeely your crush when you\n\n37:54.440 --> 38:01.640\nwere in grade school? But now he's Mr. McFeely. You had bigger fish to fry or you just weren't?\n\n38:01.640 --> 38:08.440\nYou were what? Sorry. She had a lot going on. Oh, you had, okay.\n\n38:09.880 --> 38:13.640\nYou were a girl, yeah, a girl in elementary school. So we were already practicing that\n\n38:13.640 --> 38:18.840\nsociety. Like, yeah, you had multiple suitors is what you're saying. Yeah. You got out of bed\n\n38:18.840 --> 38:23.480\nevery day and we're like, well, how am I going to handle my situation without getting slut shamed?\n\n38:23.480 --> 38:28.920\nIs like, basically, like, like I gotta, I gotta, I gotta form a circular network where I don't piss\n\n38:28.920 --> 38:34.520\nanybody off and all this stuff. And Tommy McFeely's like, how am I going to bag whatever your name\n\n38:34.520 --> 38:43.240\nis, which we will, we will let have you leave you to your privacy. I had my first like in kindergarten,\n\n38:43.240 --> 38:52.520\nit was a Nicole McHugh and like, that's actually that sounds like a detective series. She was a,\n\n38:52.520 --> 38:56.520\nshe was a, she was literally a little redhead girl, like, like Charlie Brown had his little\n\n38:56.520 --> 39:01.080\nredhead girl, which I don't think we ever saw, but Nicole McHugh was, so we would take attendance.\n\n39:01.080 --> 39:06.200\nShe always wore pantyhomes. And then when, stop, you're talking about, talking about a kindergartener.\n\n39:07.480 --> 39:11.320\nThere's just, I don't expect you to know how to weave these highway cones, but\n\n39:13.080 --> 39:16.840\nyou got to keep it more wonder years than you.\n\n39:16.840 --> 39:27.640\nBut I don't think I ever actually talked to her. I, I, I, what I remember is that during attendance,\n\n39:28.680 --> 39:33.960\nwhen my name was called, she would look at me and giggle. And when her name was called,\n\n39:33.960 --> 39:38.600\nI would look at her and giggle. And so, and I explained that to my mom. And then she said,\n\n39:38.600 --> 39:43.720\noh, you got a girlfriend. And I was like, great, that's one last thing to worry about.\n\n39:43.720 --> 39:49.640\nI, I, I feel like my memory is that I just never fucked with it. Like, I, I just like,\n\n39:49.640 --> 39:53.720\nI'm not going to go talk to her now. I was just like, I got this, this is great. Like,\n\n39:54.360 --> 39:58.040\nevery morning I get this, I get this, I get this partner was life partner.\n\n39:59.400 --> 40:00.840\nAnd she has no idea.\n\n40:02.360 --> 40:09.080\nNo, she did. Well, she, she probably doesn't remember, but she, but she had an idea. We had,\n\n40:09.080 --> 40:13.880\nit was, it was a, we were soulmates. It was just bound to morning roll call.\n\n40:15.080 --> 40:19.560\nI think you're doing a little bit of rewriting history with a little booblets,\n\n40:19.560 --> 40:24.520\nmaybe two by four. I think, I think you were giggling.\n\n40:24.520 --> 40:28.760\nI don't know why I'd make, you know, why would I revise that very self loathing?\n\n40:28.760 --> 40:32.760\nLike, like, like, why would I, because it's, it would be such an unusual thing. So it wasn't,\n\n40:32.760 --> 40:38.280\nlike, it wasn't like I move, it would make sense that I made that up. If, if the rest of the story\n\n40:38.280 --> 40:43.160\nwas that I like stalked her kindergarten style and like wouldn't leave her alone and stuff. And\n\n40:43.160 --> 40:47.800\nthe reason why I did that is because I was getting green lights, you know, I wouldn't make up the\n\n40:47.800 --> 40:54.760\ngreen lights. But, but I, and I, the way I remember it is that it was the, it was the perfect\n\n40:54.760 --> 41:03.480\nrelationship. I never talked to her. And, and there were, yeah. And I do, I was, I was aware of\n\n41:03.480 --> 41:08.920\nthe fact that there were lots and lots of girls that, that had no desire to giggle and smile.\n\n41:08.920 --> 41:13.880\nHey, it's okay. It's all right. It's fine. It's not your fault. Yeah. You're happy.\n\n41:13.880 --> 41:17.160\nIt's not your fault. You're happy now. It's not your fault. You're happy now, man.\n\n41:17.960 --> 41:21.320\nIt's not your fault. Look how these people came out to see you. You guys are jerks.\n\n41:24.840 --> 41:28.360\nEverybody's just so tired. You guys have been here all day long. How many beers have you\n\n41:28.360 --> 41:35.480\nhad been consumed here? Was there a bar here? One per person. You only got the one beer?\n\n41:37.080 --> 41:43.800\nWhat do you mean we gave you? Okay. I wouldn't give you anybody. There's more. There's more\n\n41:43.800 --> 41:51.720\nwhere people. There's more beer. There's more beer, people. Let's go to the concession. Let's all get\n\n41:51.720 --> 42:01.080\nit. We could. Everybody reach under your seat. Should we all just take a nap? We should watch\n\n42:01.080 --> 42:06.360\nthe stars. And there's this giant bottle of Kettle One taunting you from on stage.\n\n42:07.560 --> 42:13.800\nMaybe we should, we'll take a journey through space and I'll do that by slowing the tempo\n\n42:13.800 --> 42:24.520\ndown on this chord bot song. Can we get sexy lights up there? Perfect. Oh, there we go.\n\n42:29.400 --> 42:32.600\nWe made it. I'm gonna actually change some instrumentation here to make this a little\n\n42:32.600 --> 42:46.920\nbetter. We need less picked guitar, maybe a little more synth. The universe\n\n42:46.920 --> 43:01.800\nopens its arms to you and you to it. So feel the universe inside of you.\n\n43:04.600 --> 43:12.280\nThe Beetlejuice Nebula folding outward into the horse head spandex\n\n43:12.280 --> 43:22.920\nin the constellation Agamemnon orbiting Uranus and the Ork Belt,\n\n43:25.480 --> 43:35.160\nwhich I hear just had to add a new hole. Getting a little thin Milky Way. The universe is expanding.\n\n43:35.160 --> 43:44.600\nThe carbohydrate complex. We are exiting now what you know as the solar system.\n\n43:46.040 --> 43:48.680\nTry to imagine. Excuse me. I'm sorry. What? Yes.\n\n43:53.560 --> 43:54.840\nThe stars are moving.\n\n43:59.800 --> 44:02.040\nYeah, kill the, uh, can we kill the lights that are,\n\n44:02.040 --> 44:05.960\noh, those are probably just workplaces that are plugged into a generator. Yeah,\n\n44:05.960 --> 44:09.560\nthis is for our subscribers probably too, so they can see. Well, who cares? The subscribers\n\n44:09.560 --> 44:14.360\nwill not see stars if they turn the lights off. That's true. I think if they haven't been\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:19.400\nturned off by now, it means it's not gonna switch. You mean the subscribers? Yes.\n\n44:22.440 --> 44:29.240\nTry to relax. Understand that your mind is made of the same carbon as the stars around you.\n\n44:29.240 --> 44:35.720\nStars around you. You no longer crave heavy creams and sauces.\n\n44:37.800 --> 44:38.440\nSaucy.\n\n44:39.720 --> 44:48.040\nSaucy. Cigarettes have no control over you. No control, no control, no control. Do you,\n\n44:48.040 --> 44:52.760\ndo you have one? I see another voice in the cosmos. It looks a little eager to get in here.\n\n44:52.760 --> 44:59.560\nYou must kill Dave Booblets. Booblets. All right, well, I don't think that's,\n\n44:59.560 --> 45:05.000\nbecause I mean really, fuck that guy. I don't think. Get out of my treehouse,\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:11.800\nyou uptown piece of shit. We're leaving those aggressions behind. You are no longer a primate,\n\n45:11.800 --> 45:21.560\nyou are a Kubrickian space baby. No more gazelle femurs. Why do I live inside of a big old rectangle\n\n45:21.560 --> 45:29.800\nthing? That's not a planet. Saturn's up there, like a big old asshole.\n\n45:33.080 --> 45:41.160\nThe monolith represents the golden ratio and the concept of geometry, a human construct.\n\n45:41.160 --> 45:47.560\nDo you know why God likes Saturn the most, Dan? Because if you like it, you gotta put a ring on it.\n\n45:47.560 --> 45:58.200\nMoving past Saturn now, out into the outer zeochron orbit, the home of Neptune.\n\n45:58.200 --> 46:03.240\nOh, there's Uranus. Thank you. Yeah, I can see some, some Klingons on it.\n\n46:04.200 --> 46:09.640\nDo you know how Klingons get on Uranus? The captain's log.\n\n46:09.640 --> 46:17.320\nWow. It's an easy crowd.\n\n46:19.720 --> 46:23.640\nThey cling on. Okay, fuck you people.\n\n46:27.160 --> 46:29.880\nI'm sorry about that. I snapped.\n\n46:31.400 --> 46:34.120\nUranus just decided to fuck straight off into outer space.\n\n46:34.120 --> 46:44.040\nBecause we are departing the birthplace of our primate bodies and rejoining our larger progenitor.\n\n46:44.040 --> 46:50.680\nI can see my house from here. Although we are moving away from the focal point you once knew\n\n46:50.680 --> 46:57.480\nas the origin, we are actually moving toward the origin of all the created you as we move\n\n46:57.480 --> 47:04.360\nfurther toward the center of the cluster of star systems known colloquially as the Milky Way.\n\n47:05.640 --> 47:13.880\nThe center of the Milky Way is a hot, blustering epicenter of chemical reaction.\n\n47:15.560 --> 47:18.760\nProbably a big black hole wishes it could suck every...\n\n47:19.480 --> 47:22.360\nExcuse me. What? Are you gonna be done in there? Hold on a second.\n\n47:22.360 --> 47:28.520\nWhat? Are you almost done? Are you almost done in there? I'm... I have to take a shit.\n\n47:29.720 --> 47:37.560\nThere's more than one bathroom. This is the only man's bathroom. Excuse me. I don't see the world through that lens.\n\n47:39.240 --> 47:43.080\nJust hurry up. There's people waiting on here. I'm dancing on one leg. Okay. Damn it.\n\n47:43.800 --> 47:46.760\nOkay. You're leaving the... Just a little faster.\n\n47:46.760 --> 47:53.080\nThere's a urinal right here. Can I just go while you're sitting? Yes. Yes. I didn't even...\n\n47:53.640 --> 48:01.960\nYeah. Okay. Do your thing. All right. Don't look. I'm trying. Let your mind re-evaporate and expand.\n\n48:01.960 --> 48:09.800\nWhat? What? I'm not talking to you. Are you talking to me? Here's the room for one more in here.\n\n48:09.800 --> 48:17.320\nHere. Just a second. Oh, geez. Just a second. Woo. Open a window. Just a second. Okay.\n\n48:17.320 --> 48:23.480\nOpen a window to your consciousness. How do you like that? It's like somebody laid a gas giant in here.\n\n48:26.280 --> 48:29.640\nWhat do you think of that? What do you think of that? What do you think of when I'm back in there?\n\n48:29.640 --> 48:42.840\nSlowly, you're drifting back towards your point of origin as you feel your corporeal sentience,\n\n48:42.840 --> 48:51.800\ncoalesce, returning now to your original home. However, your journey has redefined you.\n\n48:51.800 --> 48:53.880\nYou like it? Your perspective. You like that?\n\n48:53.880 --> 49:03.080\nWhen you're at the bank, getting mad, you'll now remember I am but a speck on a piece of salt.\n\n49:06.840 --> 49:13.480\nDan, look, it's the moon. The moon's out tonight. Soon we will colonize the moon\n\n49:13.480 --> 49:24.040\nfive hours before Donald Trump's space force gets there and makes a McDonald's.\n\n49:25.400 --> 49:27.000\nDon't forget to wash your hands.\n\n49:31.560 --> 49:38.200\nEarth is unique, you realize now. Having experienced the inky void, you see it for what it is.\n\n49:38.200 --> 49:45.400\nA unique gem. A science fiction of its own. Are you fucking kidding me?\n\n49:46.600 --> 49:48.280\nYou already used paper towels.\n\n49:48.280 --> 50:07.960\nSo you're using the… It never works. Never works. Hey, you know, I can help it overhearing.\n\n50:08.760 --> 50:13.560\nYou're doing a really good job. You're doing a really good job at talking on the toilet there.\n\n50:13.560 --> 50:15.800\nThat's really good. Do you even know what I'm doing?\n\n50:15.800 --> 50:19.560\nNo, but I'm liking it a lot. Here, let me give you my card.\n\n50:21.560 --> 50:30.200\nAny time you want to come over to Pedro's Pizza, you just show him that card. You get\n\n50:30.200 --> 50:37.880\nlike a free chair. All right, well, I better be going. I can't hang around here all day.\n\n50:37.880 --> 50:45.320\nI'm not stopping you. Okay. See you later, Pedro. Better leave now.\n\n50:46.760 --> 50:53.080\nYeah, yeah, gotta go out into the big wide world and make my day here.\n\n50:57.960 --> 51:05.320\nSee ya. I really thought something was gonna come with that, but what are you talking about?\n\n51:05.320 --> 51:07.400\nNothing. Are you hitting on me?\n\n51:10.680 --> 51:14.520\nNo, I'm not. Don't worry about it. It's fine. I'll take the card back. If you're not gonna use it.\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:20.680\nThank you. All right. You're not that good at it.\n\n51:20.680 --> 51:36.120\nSlowly, you approach Earth's adamantine glass ceiling that keeps those of us that are targeted\n\n51:37.640 --> 51:48.600\nconfined to the Earth, or those that hover above it, orbit in predatory, self-satisfied\n\n51:48.600 --> 51:55.400\nnarcissism looking down at us like manic depressive eagles.\n\n52:00.200 --> 52:03.560\nBut you have a better perspective. You're on your meds.\n\n52:07.320 --> 52:10.760\nAnd as your therapist told you, you're getting your thoughts in order.\n\n52:10.760 --> 52:17.320\nAnd your roommate is a bitch, so you're doing it in a bathroom at a hotel.\n\n52:18.840 --> 52:25.000\nAnd that means you're gonna deal with other people. That's fine. You're patient. You're a cosmic.\n\n52:25.720 --> 52:32.200\nYou embody the universe. Your name is Michael. But your pronoun is they.\n\n52:32.200 --> 52:37.640\nThey. For you are humanity.\n\n52:37.640 --> 52:57.160\nAll right. I better wipe.\n\n52:57.160 --> 53:07.880\nThese are the credits rolling as he's, as he's wiping. It's just a big wide show.\n\n53:10.920 --> 53:14.840\nWiping is more, more tempo.\n\n53:14.840 --> 53:25.240\nWhy don't we go down. There's nothing there.\n\n53:28.280 --> 53:29.560\nI miss my mother.\n\n53:33.080 --> 53:35.960\nGo to E minor says the fucking guy.\n\n53:35.960 --> 53:44.120\nOh, yeah. He was fucking right, though.\n\n53:46.520 --> 53:49.640\nNow you can really get up in there wiping. Yeah.\n\n53:50.760 --> 53:57.480\nGo down. Yeah, tear the edges off. He minors the wiping court.\n\n53:58.680 --> 54:01.560\nIt goes like this from front to back.\n\n54:01.560 --> 54:07.560\nThat was a crazy app. Dan was kind of crazy that you weren't even looking behind you,\n\n54:07.560 --> 54:10.600\nbut you were actually kind of right on where we were in space.\n\n54:10.600 --> 54:16.120\nWell, that may be due to maybe Rob. Are you in charge of the planets? No, just the sound. Okay.\n\n54:18.040 --> 54:21.320\nSo it was God and me working together. Is this God?\n\n54:21.880 --> 54:22.760\nIs this God?\n\n54:25.960 --> 54:29.320\nIs this God? Do you want to, do you want to play that clip?\n\n54:29.320 --> 54:34.520\nI see. Has anybody ever seen the movie zapped with Scott Mayo? Scott Mayo, Willie Ames?\n\n54:34.520 --> 54:40.520\nYeah. There's a remake? Yeah, there is. I typed zapped into YouTube and there's a\n\n54:41.480 --> 54:46.520\nmodern zapped, but there's also, if you dig deep enough, there's a 1980 zapped with an actor named\n\n54:46.520 --> 54:53.560\nScott Bayo who? Willie Ames. He's been famous lately for not acting.\n\n54:53.560 --> 54:57.800\nIt's kind of a teen, a teen tit movie fantasy where a guy has telekinetic powers,\n\n54:57.800 --> 55:00.920\nand he of course uses them to make girls' shirts fly off and stuff like that.\n\n55:01.480 --> 55:05.560\nBut there's a scene where he gets BA'd by these two frat boy, like jocks,\n\n55:06.360 --> 55:09.240\nand they take their pants down and they're mocking him in the back of a convertible.\n\n55:09.240 --> 55:14.120\nHey, you weasel, thanks for losing the tournament for us. Now get a load of this.\n\n55:16.120 --> 55:20.200\nAnd then they flash his ass and then Scott Bayo uses. He's playing the clip.\n\n55:20.200 --> 55:28.600\nThey pull their asses out. They say, kiss this. And then Scott Bayo looks at the two girls\n\n55:29.160 --> 55:32.200\nwith anger and then telekinetically makes their boobs pop out.\n\n55:32.200 --> 55:48.680\nHashtag rape culture. And then he, he levitates. So listen to this.\n\n55:55.640 --> 55:58.680\nThey're hovering upside down with their asses hanging out.\n\n55:58.680 --> 56:03.960\nAnd they put him up a tree and they're like, oh, shit. And one guy goes, oh, is this God?\n\n56:04.760 --> 56:08.680\nAnd they keep saying it. It's like the, it's like the same clip, you know, like they,\n\n56:08.680 --> 56:12.440\nthey said, is this God? At some point, they just keep the editor using it.\n\n56:12.440 --> 56:19.320\nIs this God? Is this God? And the only thing that makes the boobs, it's like the boobs,\n\n56:19.320 --> 56:22.520\nyou're like, ah, geez, this isn't holding up to cultural shifts, but,\n\n56:22.520 --> 56:29.560\nbut, but, but it kind of balances out because there's so much footage of these two men's asses.\n\n56:31.240 --> 56:36.760\nThey're just like wiggling and jiggling. The film is sped up and they're just like,\n\n56:36.760 --> 56:43.960\nah, is this God? Is this God? It's a hot thing to say.\n\n56:43.960 --> 56:47.800\nI like, yeah, if you're, if you're being levitated with your friend and you're being\n\n56:47.800 --> 56:52.760\nput in a tree with your pants down, that you instantly go to a metaphysical place.\n\n56:52.760 --> 56:57.640\nIt's, it's also a weird thing to subject like, I'm sure the 12 year old kids that are watching\n\n56:57.640 --> 57:03.240\nthis movie when their parents are out of the room to see their first pair of naked Harry\n\n57:03.240 --> 57:08.920\nmen's assholes. And just hearing the phrase, is this God over and over again? Well, they're,\n\n57:08.920 --> 57:16.120\nwell each like a muscular rump is twitching over the trunk of a tree. Like, I'm sure some\n\n57:16.120 --> 57:21.160\nawakenings happen on both sides of this movie, which is why it's kind of like, it's like,\n\n57:21.160 --> 57:27.240\nsure there's a lot of, you know, yeah, I don't know. It's a very, it's a very strange film.\n\n57:27.240 --> 57:31.480\nYes. But the 80s were a strange time. Five years ago was a strange time. The rules,\n\n57:32.440 --> 57:37.560\nthey're changing fast. Changing fast. So, so much change. Yeah, you can't even put a bomb on a\n\n57:37.560 --> 57:43.560\ngirl's door anymore. It's crazy. We're looking at, we're looking at behaviors that were once\n\n57:43.560 --> 57:49.560\nallowable, completely acceptable and normal. And we're, we're, we're thinking about them now.\n\n57:49.560 --> 57:53.800\nDoesn't even really matter what, what it's the awareness is the important thing. Isn't that\n\n57:53.800 --> 57:59.240\nright, chef? I believe so. I think you have a song about that, don't you? I do. Wow.\n\n58:01.080 --> 58:06.680\nPardon? He said a women's song. Sorry, my $1,000 phone doesn't recognize my thumb print or me\n\n58:06.680 --> 58:12.680\nwith my glasses on. It's $1,000. I can't really sing right now because my voice jam, my voice is\n\n58:12.680 --> 58:16.680\na little shattered. That's all right. My phone can't turn on because I'm wearing glasses.\n\n58:19.320 --> 58:23.160\nI use the password. Wait, you have retinal scam in your phone?\n\n58:23.160 --> 58:28.040\nYeah, it's a face scam. It's scanning your face. And so if you're, I don't know, in rare\n\n58:28.040 --> 58:35.480\ncircumstances like maybe you're wearing glasses or outside. Or maybe you just have a beard.\n\n58:35.480 --> 58:38.760\nMaybe you've grown your, maybe your beard has changed. No, maybe you just had one to begin with\n\n58:38.760 --> 58:44.440\nand it hasn't changed at all. I can't believe I fell for this fucking iPhone X.\n\n58:45.320 --> 58:50.840\nI'll buy anything. I've told you that on my podcast, if you at an airport make a chalk\n\n58:50.840 --> 58:55.480\noutline with a pile of human shit in it, and you just, and you just say poor people aren't\n\n58:55.480 --> 59:01.640\nallowed to have this. I'll like pay $10,000 to like eat the shit. Like I'll just stand inside\n\n59:01.640 --> 59:08.680\nthe circle and be like, I'm, I'm important. I get to be in this circle. Who the fuck was that guy?\n\n59:12.360 --> 59:16.440\nDon't trust that ice. We don't know who that fucking was. That was Steve Levy, everybody.\n\n59:20.920 --> 59:25.560\nLove it or leave it. My eyes keep going to this guy's face. You're having a terrible time.\n\n59:25.560 --> 59:29.000\nYou're, you're, you're here as a captive, right? I mean, you didn't certainly,\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:33.320\nyou're worst mate. It's not talking to you, Deadpool. Give me a break. You're in heaven.\n\n59:33.320 --> 59:36.920\nYou talking to the guy the Yankees had here? What's your name? Yeah, it's Deadpool's uncle.\n\n59:37.960 --> 59:42.920\nWhat's your, what's your name, sir? Anthony. Anthony, are you here because you like\n\n59:42.920 --> 59:47.400\nComic Con kind of things or like? We promise we will not make fun of you if you tell us the\n\n59:47.400 --> 59:51.080\nobjective actual story of how you got here because I can tell it is not by being a fan of mine.\n\n59:52.840 --> 59:56.600\nAnd so I just want to know the step-by-step story of how you ended up at this show.\n\n59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.360\nAre you, are you with Deadpool here? Is he, is he a relation of yours?\n\n01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:08.760\nSo just so everybody knows, his face is, that's not, there's a little, no, it's, it's, it's, it's,\n\n01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:15.160\nit's this. He's, he's a good sport and it's not his fault. Also, there's like, I think it's like,\n\n01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:19.400\nthere's a light hitting your face. Yeah, you're like one of the only people who's lit. You're,\n\n01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:23.480\nyou're like, you're like, are you in the theater because you're really finding your light right\n\n01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:29.480\nnow? Your, your name, sir? Anthony. Anthony just told us. And does your son?\n\n01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:36.120\nAnthony Jr. So Anthony and Anthony. Anthony is third. So you're Anthony Jr.\n\n01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:45.800\nAnd Anthony, you, you dragged your father here? Is he, is he enjoying himself? Clearly.\n\n01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.800\nAnthony Jr. That's like data. You can't read his face.\n\n01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:55.720\nThat's how I am. See what? 71. 71 years old. Fantastic.\n\n01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.280\nAnd you're proud of your son. You're, you're proud.\n\n01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.480\nNow I'm 45. How does it feel to get to an age that gets applause?\n\n01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:15.320\nAnthony Jr. That's gotta be a little weird threshold. I was recently, I just, I just crossed\n\n01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:21.560\na threshold where a waitress came to me. I was sitting by myself and I ordered a beer and she,\n\n01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:33.320\nshe said, she said, can I see some ID? And I'm like, oh, yeah. She's like, no discriminating,\n\n01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.520\nright? And she was just like, she's like 25. She's just having the time of her life. She's just\n\n01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:44.600\nlike, that would be hilarious if I carted Ian McKellen. Like I just realized she walked away\n\n01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:51.720\nand I was like, wow, I've, yeah, I mean, I, I don't really, I don't mind dying. I, I, I, I,\n\n01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:58.920\nI don't want to be 25 again. I remember it was very, very difficult. And I'm, I'm, I'm okay,\n\n01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:05.080\nbut it's, it is just odd to monitor these milestones. You said your age and then everyone\n\n01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:12.760\napplauded, but the subtext was you made it. Your father's 96. Wow. Oh, your dad's still alive. He's\n\n01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:21.320\n96. No applause for that shit. At 71, I'd be applauding that because he's like a genetic,\n\n01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:27.640\nlike he's carving the way for you. I, I, I, I, my, my, my, my patriarchs kind of, we don't know\n\n01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.000\nhow biologically what their expiration date is. They tend to, they tend to take themselves out with\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.920\ncigarettes, with, with cigarettes and things, not, not with, not, not Hemingway style. I just mean\n\n01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.920\nthey, they, they, they don't, they, they use the world around them. They don't, they don't, they\n\n01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:49.320\ndon't just like sit there and like try to avoid dying. They kind of like, oh, that looks good.\n\n01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:56.360\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry. What? What? Oh, okay. Go ahead, Dan. We brought him into the show. I know,\n\n01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.880\nI know, I know, I know. Sorry about your son. Dan doesn't have a son and neither does Rob and\n\n01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:09.960\nneither does Jeff and neither do I. You guys are obviously pretty close then. Yeah. Yeah. That's\n\n01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:16.440\ncool. You, you and your son can go out. Well, Anthony Jr., how old are you? I'm in the 30s.\n\n01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:22.120\nOkay. He's very trepidatious. I'm sorry. I didn't, he's wearing a Deadpool mask. He's wearing a mask.\n\n01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:31.240\nI'm over 20. It's perfectly fine here. You're fine here. I think no one's like,\n\n01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:36.920\nhe's in his 30s and he's dressed as Deadpool at a convention. This is where we come to escape\n\n01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:46.360\nthat kind of pressure. Yeah. Well, I mean, she, she, she affected me. He said the bartender would\n\n01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.680\nhave torn down his tank. It didn't affect me. I remembered it. You know, like, we're all, yeah,\n\n01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:56.120\nwe all, we all get, we all get, we all get hit. All of our buttons get mashed at different times.\n\n01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:02.120\nI think the, I think the objective is the, is the, the, the, the, uh, uh, you get this big keyboard\n\n01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:07.160\nof buttons and like, I think, I think you want them all lit up before you die. And like the ones\n\n01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.360\nthat aren't lit up yet, the first time they get pushed, they, it's like Jesus Christ, they go from\n\n01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:18.200\nnot lit up to lit up and it's a monumental event. And sometimes that's traumatic. It almost always\n\n01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.360\nis traumatic. How many of them are just eating your first chocolate bar? There's like five of those.\n\n01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:28.760\nThe rest of them are trauma based. And then you're like, Oh God, that happened. But then, then, then\n\n01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.840\npeople can just put beers down on those buttons. They're already lit up. They don't toggle. They\n\n01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:40.040\ndon't go off. It's called scarring. Uh, and, and, and I think, I think the objective is to like try\n\n01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.920\nto like, you know, get, and I think to extend the metaphor, I don't think you're able to like\n\n01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:50.200\nreally push most of them. I think most of those buttons are only accessible because other people\n\n01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.600\nhave to push them. They have to do with other people. Didn't you carry around like a towel\n\n01:04:54.600 --> 01:05:00.920\nlike Arthur Dent for a long time? Yes. When you were, when you were younger? Yes, I did. Yes,\n\n01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:06.840\nI was very into Hitchhiker's Guide and when I was a middle school, yeah, dead pill, little, little,\n\n01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:11.320\nlittle late to be so into something that you actually have a towel that you carry around.\n\n01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:18.200\nBut I went to a public high junior high and there, there wasn't a lot to distract me from,\n\n01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:28.280\nyeah. I didn't dress like Doctor Who. I dressed as like my version of Doctor Who.\n\n01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:38.280\nUh-huh. Like I had a, a, a USA cap and I would wear four scarves, cut off jeans, two different\n\n01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:43.800\npairs of shoes. Four scarves? Yeah. What do you mean two different pairs of shoes? You mean one,\n\n01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.400\nyou mean, you mean a mismatched pair of shoes? A mismatched. Like Punky Brewster. Yeah, I would put\n\n01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:52.760\nthem on my hands and feet. Yeah, I don't know. I thought, I thought maybe they were a side-by-side.\n\n01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:58.440\nI know Hawaiian shirt and I. Like a T-Rex, T-Rex cop with a Whippy Goldberg thing. Yeah, and uh,\n\n01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:05.000\nand I would walk, I would walk out of the, I would go to, I would walk home from school and my mom\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:12.760\nwould meet me with this look. Why are you so well lit? Are you the devil? I don't know. He's got this\n\n01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:16.840\nawesome. He's got a, he's holding a bounce forward or something. He looks like, he's about to, like\n\n01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:22.040\nhe's the, he's the third act like of a horror movie that's about to happen. He's like Highlander.\n\n01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.760\nHe's like the beginning of Highlander when they push in during the wrestling game. Like,\n\n01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:32.920\nlike the wrestling game. That wrestling game. Who here, oh, let's continue this streak. It's,\n\n01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:38.920\nit's a very, it's a very nice energy. It's an intimate energy. Who here wants to share their,\n\n01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:45.480\nlike actually come up here, take the mic and share their story of like when they crossed the\n\n01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:53.560\nthreshold into alienation, isolation, nerd culture, when there was no longer any hope for, of, of\n\n01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:58.680\nassimilation. We've, we've got lots of. Let's make it a gal because we have enough dudes up here.\n\n01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:08.680\nAnybody? You miss right there. What's your name? Isabelle. Let's welcome Isabelle down to the stage.\n\n01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:14.600\nShe's gonna make it down without destroying the place like Rob when he came down. It was gonna\n\n01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:19.560\nbe great if it would have went off like rehearsal. Did you want to fall down the stairs? No, nobody\n\n01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:31.960\nwants to fall down. Well, you do stuff like that. Isabelle, everybody. Well, when I became into this\n\n01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:37.720\nculture, my dad actually brought me into this culture. Uh-oh. He took you to a planetarium\n\n01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:43.800\nshow and let you dress as Deadpool. It was all downhill from there. But that means he can take\n\n01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:52.120\nyou out of this culture. I brought you into this culture that I can take you out of. My dad started\n\n01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:59.880\nintroducing me to Buffy, everything I know. Oh, even Doctor Who. Oh, I go to. It's a good show.\n\n01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:04.760\nIt's a good show, right? Which, who's your favorite doctor? My favorite doctor is Matt Smith, who I\n\n01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:13.320\nactually met. Very good. Very good. Very good. Good doctor. Pretty much. I met everyone I know, uh-oh,\n\n01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:23.480\nfrom cons every now and then. Are you old school? Old school. Oh, I've been to icon. That's an old\n\n01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:30.200\nschool con. No, I meant like old school Doctor Who. Yeah, I watched old school Doctor Who a couple\n\n01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:38.440\nof times. What do you mean by icon? Icon is a convention. Oh, okay. For optometrist. It used to\n\n01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:46.680\nbe held all the way out in, uh, I believe it. Stony Brook. Stony Brook? Yeah. I haven't been there\n\n01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:54.200\nsince I was six, so. But you felt welcomed when you were in that world, right? Your dad started\n\n01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:01.160\ntaking you to kind of conventions like this. That was like, like, he was a Buffy fan? Yeah, he was\n\n01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:09.560\nBuffy. He was, I'm trying to think, Star Wars, Star Trek. I'm trying to think of other stuff. So he's\n\n01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:19.000\nour age. Yeah. We're supposed to have Isabelle's by now. If we were adults, if we lived anywhere\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.760\nbut Los Angeles, we would have lovely, uh, human beings that are joining the world as we fade.\n\n01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:32.200\nInstead we're, instead we're buying Teslas to try to hide our bold spot. You actually met my dad.\n\n01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:37.640\nI met your dad. Yeah, he was the photographer. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, he was saying how excited you\n\n01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:43.480\nwere. I got the impression that you weren't able to be here, because he was like, my daughter would\n\n01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:49.160\nbe thrilled or whatever. Like he was taking pictures in there, if they're doing signing. Yeah. Oh. He was\n\n01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:54.440\nthe main guy taking pictures. That's great. Yeah, I mean, I, so, so, so you remember that feeling\n\n01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:00.040\nof like, like going to a convention and all of a sudden like, it was like, like, oh, like, like,\n\n01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.120\noh, is it, do you think it was more like the absence of the kinds of things you felt walking in the\n\n01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:10.520\nhalls of your school where you were like, there's just like, it's like this chiropractic ergonomic\n\n01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:16.760\nlike pressure. You're like, I can't do nothing right around here. Like I, if I answer a question,\n\n01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:20.920\neven though I know the answer, I know I'm going to do it wrong. I'm going to get laughed at somehow,\n\n01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:26.280\nor they just like everything is like, geez, you feel like, you feel like it's a, like the world is\n\n01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:33.480\ncovered in, in half full glasses at this table and every gesture you make knocks three of them over\n\n01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:38.360\nand you desperately don't want to. So then you start gesturing differently. And then that's funny.\n\n01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:43.320\nAnd then you, and then you go to, for me, it was Gen Con in Milwaukee, like,\n\n01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:50.200\nwhich was the, just, there was this role playing and base D&D and stuff, but it was, it was just like,\n\n01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:58.920\noh God, to see grown men and women wearing ridiculous armor and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,\n\n01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:06.360\nand, like, the, actually, my mom, my mom, my mom took me to stuff before that. I think my mom knew,\n\n01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:11.320\nshe's like, she's like, this kid collects stickers. He's like, he's not going to be a football star.\n\n01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:17.640\nAnd where is your, how, what's the state of your parents' marriage, like, historically?\n\n01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:24.280\nI'm not trying to pick up her mom. They're, they've been together the whole time.\n\n01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:30.520\nYeah, they've been together. They got married right before I was born. So that's how it's\n\n01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:37.480\nusually supposed to work, but they had my, my brother was first, as my mom met my dad. So.\n\n01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.800\nOkay. How is your, what's your mom's relationship with the nerd stuff?\n\n01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:46.920\nShe goes to it every now and then just hold the stand.\n\n01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.960\nIs that a, is that a reference to the chupa from a Jewish wedding? She says, she's doing her part.\n\n01:11:53.960 --> 01:12:00.600\nHold the stand. No, she holds the stand for photography.\n\n01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:06.440\nShe literally holds the light stand. I thought it was like, I heard, like,\n\n01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:12.440\nI heard hold the standard, like, like it's a battle, like, if this man shall fall, who will pick up the standard?\n\n01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:21.480\nBut is your mom kind of like, you know, like, can you let me know whenever I'm prying or whatever\n\n01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:25.880\nI'm going to like exploit a horrible, deep-seated, like, personality conflicts within your family\n\n01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:33.400\nunit and cause a breakup? But is your, is your dad's a nerd? Let's just put it that way. Is your mom, like,\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:44.680\nnot a nerd? Is she like, she's, I think she's like, she watches murder mystery shows. She's that type of nerd.\n\n01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:49.720\nThere's a good crossover there, like, true crime stuff. I find like, I, yeah, like, my girlfriend's\n\n01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:57.160\nnot into sci-fi and fantasy necessarily. She's into what, you know, me being happy. But like,\n\n01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.760\nat the same time, like, she's not going to, by default, want to watch a shitty, like,\n\n01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:08.920\nGil Gerard is an astronaut in prison. Like, I, but we both, and I don't want, I don't like rom-coms,\n\n01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:16.280\nbut like, we both like, real life murder. Because it's sort of like, as extreme as normal life gets.\n\n01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:22.440\nAnd I think, I think that's why I like sci-fi is because it, it, it, it heightens everything. It\n\n01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.640\nstains human relationships with iodine. So it, because every story on Star Trek is like, well,\n\n01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:34.600\nwhat, who, what is good and what is evil? It's like a, it's too nuanced in 27 dresses. So, so,\n\n01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.320\nlike, I don't, I'm not going to taste every nook and cranny of what Kate Hudson's going through. But\n\n01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:45.480\nlike, I like, I like a guy to go like, there's an octopus monster on the poop deck of the Starfleet.\n\n01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:51.240\nAnd he only tastes fear. And he says, you have a choice between killing someone you love and\n\n01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:55.560\npowering your rocket boots. And, and, and, okay, now I'm starting to, now I can break this down\n\n01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:04.120\ninto rules and cope. Do you, do you, do you, what's what grade are you in? I'm going into 12 right\n\n01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:09.160\nnow. Oh, wow. So you're almost out. Yeah, I'm finally almost out. What are you going to do?\n\n01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:14.520\nWhat are you interested in? Or do you hate that question? I'm thinking of going for US history.\n\n01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:21.000\nOh, wow. That you're going to be like a keeper. Like, like, you're going to be the only person\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:30.600\nthat knows we did this before. Is there a certain period, is there a certain era or time or place\n\n01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:37.480\nthat you're most fascinated with? I'm pretty much fascinated with all of US history. I find myself\n\n01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:46.920\nthinking about the 1930s a lot lately. I don't know why. I just find. Not necessarily a fan,\n\n01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:52.920\nbut just it keeps. Yeah, I don't know. I keep running it over in my head. I really learned so\n\n01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:58.280\nmuch. Your, your, your dad's a photographer and your mother is, does she do anything creative as\n\n01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:05.080\nwell? She does dialysis. That's only what she does. Like she needs dialysis or she provides\n\n01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:10.680\ndialysis. Photos too. She, they're both photographers. She's a freelance dialysis technician. She's not\n\n01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:15.160\nlicensed, but she has a Nevada you don't have to be. She has a food truck outside.\n\n01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:21.080\nNo, your mom, your mom actually, that's like her specialty is she, she\n\n01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:27.880\nadministrates dialysis. Like she puts the needle in and watches the. Yeah. Yeah. Damn.\n\n01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:34.840\nYeah. I remember seeing some like, who was there? Like, uh, do you watch that John Oliver show at\n\n01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:43.320\nHBO? They did a second dialysis, like, and how it's like, as an industry, like dialysis for,\n\n01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:48.600\nfor money and how it's like, like big dialysis, like, like, like, like people like. I think my mom\n\n01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:55.000\nmight have. Yeah. She, like, I want, I, I can't remember anything about it except it freaks me\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.800\nout. The idea that there's a whole industry where we get our blood changed to like Jiffy Lube. Well,\n\n01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:04.280\nthey're probably like stocking your good blood and giving you back like used blood, right?\n\n01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:12.600\nSo do you want to be a teacher? Sprite blood, but just sprite blood. I wish if we could be so\n\n01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.960\nlucky to have sprite blood. Aren't you a little bit, uh. Sprite suck. Sprite's good. I don't want\n\n01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:22.120\nto make assumptions, but if you're a nerd and like, I went through this stuff and you weren't like,\n\n01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:27.320\noh, no, I feel like the bell of the ball in the high school. Like, like, all right. If, if, assuming\n\n01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:32.760\na couple things here, like, you know, like 85% or so of your student body here, like,\n\n01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:38.520\naren't you, aren't you a little, when you think about being a teacher, don't you,\n\n01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:44.920\ndo you, don't you get scared? Like, like, listen, then I have to like, be the most hated person\n\n01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:50.840\nto these like morons that, but you know, do you feel empathy for them and you want them to be\n\n01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:59.560\nsmarter and know the history and don't repeat it. Yeah. The bad part of history. You can repeat the\n\n01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:14.760\ngood part. If you guys want to do another gold rush, go ahead. There's gold. Go find gold, baby.\n\n01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:22.440\nDo you, do you, do you, I don't want to put you on the spot, but could you teach us some history?\n\n01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:33.240\nI just finished a whole US history regions. Okay. Just give it, give us a taste. Could you give us\n\n01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.560\na taste? Dan, put, play your space music and she can lay some history on us. Okay. If this is\n\n01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:43.240\nembarrassing, just, just give me this and I'll stop. But if you want to also, you could tell me if\n\n01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:49.560\nyou don't feel comfortable telling that to Schrab. Because I'm on your side and not trying to harm\n\n01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:54.760\nyou. Just don't talk to SOTY human resources. They're just trying to protect their own legal\n\n01:17:54.760 --> 01:18:06.520\ndepartment, whatever you do. So it's like, because kids scubs, oh man, oh man, did you see that show\n\n01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:12.760\nlast night? Oh man, I'll YouTube you later. Hashtag motherfucker. And then, and then I'll sit down.\n\n01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:21.400\nOkay. And then, and then you walk in. And again, if you don't want to just tell me, and I will\n\n01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:26.120\nmake this stop because I don't want you to feel bad. I really don't really want anything because I\n\n01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:31.800\njust went like through that whole test. Yeah. That's great because you probably nailed it. Yeah.\n\n01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:42.120\nSorry. Sorry. We're trying to do a show. What was the topic? I'll teach history and we'll see if\n\n01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:48.760\nyou can stand letting me do it. Pretend like you're you're you're here to dance the teacher and you're\n\n01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:53.720\nlike going to grade him. Right. On how you're like a teacher, teacher. And I'm trying to pass an\n\n01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.600\nexam so I can become a teacher. And they're the students that are like that. You just you just\n\n01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:03.960\nwon like a lot of a ton of money. And now you're going to leave. And you want to make sure that\n\n01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:09.080\nyour legacy goes on. You know, you're like, this is the week you give me a historical area.\n\n01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:13.400\nYeah. How about the 1930s? Okay, you brought that up.\n\n01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:21.560\nTalk about the Great Depression. Right. Okay. Great Depression. What was so great about it? I\n\n01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:25.320\nmean, it seemed like everybody was pissed off. I mean, come on. You can use that.\n\n01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:37.560\nYeah. The 1930s saw the planet coping with a global economic crisis.\n\n01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:43.880\nStill the aftermath of the Versailles Treaty from World War One. I got that right.\n\n01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.920\nThe biggest bearer of the biggest brunt being the\n\n01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:55.640\nCausers of World War One. But let's not throw anyone under the bus. Germany.\n\n01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:04.120\nIn the streets of Berlin, you could take a stack of German money. And it was more valuable as a\n\n01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:09.880\ndoorstop than it was legal tender. Rocks were worth more money than money.\n\n01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:15.800\nAnd the world didn't care. You couldn't cry out from from from Germany. We got it pretty\n\n01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:20.440\nbad over here. We're really broke. Like no one's going to go boo-hoo for the people that\n\n01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:26.760\nhad worse spiked helmets look like Darth Vader minus the skull and invented mustard gas or\n\n01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:34.040\ncaused us to invent it. I don't know. World War One was really bad. World War One was so bad that\n\n01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:41.240\nit defines everything up to and including World War Two. The 1930s, the bridge between those times\n\n01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:47.400\nsaw the entire planet going into a right wing slide. People were starting to get into this thing\n\n01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:55.800\ncalled nationalism. Why is my country anyone else's business? Why isn't it me versus the other\n\n01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:02.200\ncountries? How do I know other countries have my best interest at heart? Maybe I should stockpile\n\n01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:09.560\nweaponry. Maybe I should put a tighter cinch on immigration. Maybe I should industrialize,\n\n01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:15.000\ninstitutionalize, even nationalize some of our chief institutions. Maybe there's people in this\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.680\ncountry already that I don't really like the way they got here in the first place. So why are they\n\n01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:28.280\nin control of the garment district? Why are they all why do why do they get to bank? Why do they get\n\n01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:35.000\nto gem? Why do they get to get their fingers in these pies? And in every country throughout the\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:42.520\nworld, scapegoating starts to get... It gets funny. It gets funny. So you have scapegoating,\n\n01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.640\nyou have the ceiling of the borders, you have the stockpiling of arms, and you start to embrace\n\n01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:54.280\nhierarchy. There's an authoritarian instinct inside of all of us. When times get tough and\n\n01:21:54.280 --> 01:22:02.600\nconfusing, the easiest thing to do is to be told what to do. You want simplicity. You don't want\n\n01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:09.800\ncomplexity when your family is hungry and when issues are being brought to your face every day.\n\n01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:13.960\nYou're getting a fire hose of information. Hey, did you hear down the street? This person thinks\n\n01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:20.600\nthat they have the right to do this. We not even have a job. And when those things happen, we look\n\n01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:28.040\nfor charismatic people. Even if they're not charismatic the way we like our friends to be\n\n01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:34.200\ncharismatic. Even if they're the leader version of charismatic people who maybe say the things that\n\n01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.240\nwe don't want to say to our daughters at the dinner table because we know they'll make us feel\n\n01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:46.440\nstupid or angry or hateful. We want someone to just say it really loud so that agreeing with them\n\n01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:53.160\ncan be as easy as saying nothing at all. And then all the countries start doing that. We do it over\n\n01:22:53.160 --> 01:23:00.760\nhere. We do it over there. Europe, it's concentrated in that landlocked portion. These people that\n\n01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:06.920\nwhen we walked away from World War One and entered all of our depressions, we let them,\n\n01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:14.200\nyou know, foot the bill because they were to blame. So they stockpiled more weaponry because\n\n01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:20.120\nyou can convert your entire economy into a perceivable profit if you just say, well, fuck our\n\n01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:28.600\ndollar. Let's just say your job is to make a tank. And I'll buy it. I'm your country. Yay,\n\n01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:35.880\nwe're Enron. So you're just making more tanks. And, you know, there's treaties you agreed to that\n\n01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:40.440\nsaid you wouldn't do that, but everybody's got their own problems and everybody's isolationist\n\n01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:46.920\nand everybody's nationalist. So what voting part of the public is going to go? Yes, I agree, Senator.\n\n01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:52.200\nI think we should spend our time monitoring Germany and making sure they don't do things.\n\n01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:58.520\nWe should definitely pay a lot of attention to that huge threat that is that weird guy with that\n\n01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:04.840\nweird haircut who is threatening everyone and saying that he deserves to be on the global stage.\n\n01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.120\nYou know, you're going to get a lot more sympathy going. Fuck that. Who cares? Even\n\n01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:15.080\nmaybe some people go, you know what? I like the cut of that guy's jib. He's making the trains run on\n\n01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:23.640\ntime. Fuck you, Senator. You're not reelected. And so it's like a system that just slides and\n\n01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:28.200\nslides and slides and it lasts years and years and years and it isn't the pendulum that swings.\n\n01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:36.440\nIt's not like a sine wave. It's a linear ramp that just mounts like the flu. It just keeps going\n\n01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:43.240\nand going. All the countries keep sealing up and stockpiling and mistrusting. And then they\n\n01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:48.920\nstart the frenzied alliances. Oh, I'm friends with this person because the enemy of the enemy\n\n01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:54.440\nis my friend. Who's to say that this murderer isn't cooler than you? At least their clock\n\n01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:59.160\nis bigger. At least their missiles are stronger. I like them. I like you too. Let's take pictures\n\n01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:03.880\ntogether. Oh, I love it. Oh, no, I hate you. I'm going to go to war with you. Just kidding.\n\n01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:10.280\nThere is no truth. What's the truth? Who gives a fuck? As long as the poor people aren't\n\n01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:17.560\nstorming our castles and hanging us in the marketplace, who cares? So the stockpiles\n\n01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:24.600\ncontinue to stockpile. And then there's an incident. Something happens. In World War I,\n\n01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:34.040\nit was whatever his name was, Duke Ferdinand, Archduke Bishop Pontofoot. Little Lord Fontalroy\n\n01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:40.280\nwas murdered. But, you know, I was only supposed to talk about the thirties and the thirties are\n\n01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:49.400\nsimply just, you know, there's this kooky guy in the in the in the Europe who no one has the energy\n\n01:25:49.400 --> 01:26:04.520\nor the international feateness to bother to police starts, you know, saying, well, maybe we should\n\n01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:09.240\nbe here. Maybe we should be there. Maybe the whole problem is that we've been denied our natural right\n\n01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:15.560\nto be everywhere. And so you don't argue with them and you let them annex and you let them do stuff.\n\n01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:21.160\nAnd meanwhile in the cities where it's happening, where there are no cameras, people are being\n\n01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:30.040\ncategorized, sorted. If you say this, then you're that. That makes you this. The media,\n\n01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:39.160\nvery simply just it's either state run or it's fake news. It's just something that isn't supposed\n\n01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:44.920\nto be paid attention to back then. It was as easy as taking a Molotov cocktail going into the local\n\n01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.880\nprinting press and kicking it over, buying it, stealing it, beating up the guy that ran it.\n\n01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:56.120\nBut the bottom line is you take control of the media. You control the truth.\n\n01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:02.360\nEverybody that lives within each boundary, they only know one thing, which is that everybody's\n\n01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:10.840\nout to get them. And then they know pride. They know uniforms. They know parades, colors, speeches,\n\n01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:17.960\namazing, simple things. Like, oh my God, it's been so complicated. I'm so tired of being embarrassed\n\n01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:23.880\nat parties. So tired of being told I'm thisophobic and thatophobic. And then I owe this person this,\n\n01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:29.800\neven though I barely have that. God, what if it was the truth? What if the truth was so simple?\n\n01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:35.640\nWhat if it was just that everybody that doesn't look like me and wasn't born exactly where I was\n\n01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:41.240\nborn is a piece of shit out to get me and they just need to be rounded up and sequestered.\n\n01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:46.440\nI'm not going to do anything bad to them. I don't wish any harm on them. I just want them out of\n\n01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:52.600\nmy fucking business, out of my face, out of my restaurant. I don't want them in my cabinets\n\n01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:58.280\nor in my parliaments. Why can't they take care of themselves? What's the big fucking deal?\n\n01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:04.040\nEverybody just is out for themselves. I just want simplicity. That's all anyone wants.\n\n01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:08.360\nIf I see a cookie on a plate and I don't eat it, I'm going to come back and it's going to be eaten.\n\n01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:13.320\nI'm going to eat it now. And the guy stands on a balcony and he says, this is what I'm talking about.\n\n01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:20.120\nLike, if you trace everything back, we invented it all. We're the fucking kings and we have been\n\n01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:25.960\ndenied this. There was a golden age. Don't pin me down on it. I'm not a historian or anything. I'm\n\n01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:32.520\njust a orator. I'll just tell you over and over again. Back then, there was this simple time.\n\n01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:37.240\nYou know what I'm talking about? You were 10 years old once. Didn't it feel simpler then?\n\n01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:43.400\nDidn't it feel like there was truth and falseness? Why is it so complicated now? What's with the\n\n01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:49.400\nearrings and the tattoos and the biracals and the transimitans? What's with all this Facebook\n\n01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:54.680\nbusiness? Fuck this. I want to say Merry Christmas. I'm going to say Merry Christmas all the day.\n\n01:28:54.680 --> 01:29:02.040\nAnd you cheer and you chant and you parade and the missiles just keep piling up. And then eventually,\n\n01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:06.040\nyou know, we get to 1939.\n\n01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:19.160\nAnd the guy that's never been told no is only going to do one thing. It's not going to be to\n\n01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:25.160\ntake a time out. He's tried everything he could fucking do. I tell you, like, he still hasn't\n\n01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.480\nbeen told no. He still hasn't been challenged, not by his own people, not by anybody on the global\n\n01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:36.440\nstage. So you start going big. You do one big thing. And then we see how people respond.\n\n01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:43.720\nAnd I think that is that a Polish thing? Is that the invasion of Poland? Maybe the Blitzkrieg.\n\n01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:51.480\nThe Blitzkrieg. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So I take it from your not interrupting me that I kind\n\n01:29:51.480 --> 01:30:01.880\nof nailed it. Okay. All right. Isabel, you want to give him a grade on that? Be brutal. Be brutal.\n\n01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:08.680\nA hundred? A hundred? Jesus. I mean, I don't think he used enough specifics. Out of a thousand.\n\n01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:11.960\nThere's a lot of dates in history. Was there really a lot of piercings and tattoos going\n\n01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:16.040\non in Berlin? And you know, the only way to follow that is with Sports Corner.\n\n01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:25.240\nWorld Cup edition. Dan Harmon's going to break down the World Cup standings for you right now.\n\n01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.960\nHad a big day in the World Cup, but Dan Harmon's going to give you all the\n\n01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.080\ntoday's highlights and see what we've got coming up on the knockout stage.\n\n01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:42.840\nWell, America has been seized as they are every time this period with FIFA madness.\n\n01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:55.400\nThe Federal International Football Association is on fire. This is a global sport. Every country's\n\n01:30:55.400 --> 01:31:01.160\ngot a team. And right now we're at the World Cup time World Cup. I mean, it's sort of the\n\n01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:06.920\nit's sort of the World Series of soccer. How do you feel about USA's chances going forward?\n\n01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:15.000\nYou know, I mean, USA, I'm taking them out. You know, like, I don't think we should even\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.200\nconsider them in the running. I mean, that's right, because they're not they're not in the\n\n01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:23.000\nrunning. They didn't even make it in. This is a European sport. Yeah. But you know, Italy is\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:29.480\nalways a powerhouse. Of course, the blues, the blues. Yeah. Yeah. He told me that at the bar.\n\n01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:38.760\nThey're called the blues. Yeah, well, I mean, look, I, I, speaking of you and me talking\n\n01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:44.920\nfootball at the bar today, you, you were up in a lather. You were in a veritable lather about the\n\n01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:49.880\nwhole video assisted replay thing. Now they can go back and look at penalties and look at off\n\n01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:56.120\nscience calls. Right. Where do you fall on that, Dan? Oh, you know, soccer used to be about the\n\n01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:05.960\nyardage, the yardage. And now you can make a CG line on the field and you can know exactly when\n\n01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:15.960\nLewis Suarez is biting someone. So I guess I'm for it. I like I think there should be more\n\n01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:20.120\naccountability. There's a lot of drama out in that field, people faking injuries and rolling\n\n01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:26.680\naround. There was one thing when an Austria, I'm serious now, I read today when the Swiss team,\n\n01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:33.000\nwhat the fuck? When the Swiss team beat the Serbians, there's two Swiss players who are of\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:39.800\nAlbanian like ethnic descent who are from Kosovo. I mean, the Swiss are going to perform exactly\n\n01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:49.560\nthe same way every year, like clockwork. It's what they do. Yeah. I think, I think, I don't\n\n01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:52.760\neven think they care about soccer. I think they use it as an opportunity to do meta promotion for\n\n01:32:52.760 --> 01:33:05.160\ntheir clocks. Sports Corner. All right. Isabel, you're going to give a college in mind or is that\n\n01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:13.960\ntoo early to say? I don't have a college in mind yet. And I haven't started really looking. Yeah,\n\n01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:21.480\nyou shouldn't. You don't actually start looking. I remember there were a lot of, when I was in\n\n01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:26.440\n11th grade, it started with the, you got to write a letter to your college. There was like a lot of,\n\n01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:32.840\nthere was so much pressure on the college thing that it really kind of like, I think it's why I\n\n01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:38.120\ndropped out immediately. So I think it's good that you take it like, you just like, so that you know\n\n01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:41.880\nthe day you wake up and go to college, you're choosing to go to college because there was so\n\n01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:47.720\nmuch from the age of 15 for me. I didn't even, college was like some religion. It was like not\n\n01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:52.840\na real thing. I kept thinking it was this thing that happened after high school where I would,\n\n01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:57.720\nand I was basing it on like John Hughes movies and things and going like, oh, I'm going to then cut\n\n01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:03.720\nclasses and party and be like an adult or like paper chase. I'm going to have arguments with a\n\n01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:09.240\nprofessor and then I went and I was like, I don't want to be at college and I dropped out. So I mean,\n\n01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:13.960\nI think it's better that you're not under so much pressure that you can like look at it like a thing\n\n01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:30.280\nyou want to do. It's the worst podcast ever to listen to, right? I'm not fishing for anything.\n\n01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:37.480\nMe neither. That's good. Well, I mean, do you have anything to plug?\n\n01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:44.360\nJust adulthood, right? I'm going to be an adult soon.\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.200\nLook for that. What about your, what about your father's photography business?\n\n01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:59.320\nJ.F. Sheehan and photography. If anyone wants to just contact John Sheehan and\n\n01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:08.920\nif he's not busy, he'll answer you. What's the name of the company again?\n\n01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:13.480\nJohn F. Sheehan Photography. Dan, you want to do a little jingle so you can make like a\n\n01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:24.120\nJ.F. Sheehan Photography is a world of cameras true. They've got a wide selection and the camera's\n\n01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:32.360\njust for you. John Sheehan will take the camera and point it at the stuff.\n\n01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:42.440\nLook through a hole in the back of it and that will be enough. J.J. Sheehan Photography is a\n\n01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:55.880\nwonderful world of cameras. We owe Mike Gravello some money. Hopefully no one from Mike Gravello's\n\n01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:01.160\nphotography will be listening to that. We might have taken some parts of their jingle\n\n01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:06.360\nto the point where I accidentally advertised your father's photography service as a place where\n\n01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:10.360\nyou could buy cameras and then I kind of corrected it under the fly and said,\n\n01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:13.960\ndon't go, but he'll look through the hole on the other side. All right, let's give it a\n\n01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:19.640\nfree Zabelle. Thank you. Thank you, Zabelle. What a wonderful... Thank you for allowing me on your show.\n\n01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:29.000\nGood job. Zabelle, everybody. Oops, sorry. Don't give her a giant plushy pickle rick in her quiver.\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.720\nI don't even have... She's got a pickle rick quiver. She's got a pickle rick quiver.\n\n01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:45.320\nShe's an Indian giver of life. She's got a pickle rick quiver. She hurts my liver. I drink\n\n01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:55.640\nwhile I shiver. In life, when the freaks come out, they come out right. A pickle rick quiver\n\n01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:04.600\nis an Indian giver politically incorrect term. Give it away, take it back. I'm gonna have a\n\n01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:14.840\nheart attack. I'm 71 years old. My name is Anthony. Oh, that's a good time to still be.\n\n01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:25.240\nMy name is Anthony. I came with my son, you see. I don't listen to your pack ass. You seem like a\n\n01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:31.240\nblowhard ass. I just want to live another day. My dad turned 96 the other day. I'm trying to make\n\n01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:37.080\nit that far. I can't wait to get to my car. I'm stealing the cheese in my pocket. You suck.\n\n01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:53.080\nOh, shit. Oh, we got sexy lights. No. We have so much lighting in this sit-down\n\n01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:58.680\nslow show. We only have a small bit left of the show. Should we play a little D&D to get things\n\n01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:07.160\ngoing here? Anthony, you're gonna love this. Anthony, I want you to buckle your holy shit\n\n01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:12.600\nbelt because it's about to get fucking nerdy. If you thought the last 90 minutes was inaccessible.\n\n01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:22.600\nImagine a wheelchair ramp made of knives and puppy bones. Anthony, you got your Yankees cap\n\n01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:30.920\non there. You're a big Yankee fan. You wear it for the sale? It's more about East Coast\n\n01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:34.840\nRap than it is the actual football baseball. Are you more of a East Coast Rap style guy or\n\n01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:40.680\nare you like the West Coast Rap? Anthony, you don't like rap? What do you like? What's your music?\n\n01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:49.480\nSixty's Folk? Yeah. Like Moody Blues? Or is it like genuine folk? Like, as soon as Bob Dylan\n\n01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:55.720\nsteps in, you're like, this is starting to sell out a little bit. Jimmy Hendrix. He's my favorite\n\n01:38:55.720 --> 01:39:04.920\nfolk singer. What do you think? I thought he got out of the army. I thought he pretended to be gay\n\n01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:23.000\nto get out of the army. His leg was gay though, right? Gay for combat. That's what I would use\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.560\nreverse psychology. If I was in a draft, I'd go to the army and I'd say, listen, I want to fight so\n\n01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:36.200\nbad. My leg is gay for the army. I can't wait to get out there and fight. But then one of my legs\n\n01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:41.720\nis just regular. So I don't know what to do. I don't know if you want me running in circles,\n\n01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.640\nbut you know, I probably should just stay home.\n\n01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:54.520\nJust not a coward, but I shouldn't fight in a war. But then in that movie, there would be a smash\n\n01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:59.320\nwipe to you with a shaved head and a full military fatigue zone and a gun. And one of my legs cut\n\n01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:09.000\noff. Whether or not a bomb strapped to my being dropped out the Bombay doors. What do you think\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.280\nof Bob Dylan, Anthony, as a folk guy? Because he seems like a polarizing figure. Do you like\n\n01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:22.840\nBob Dylan? Do you respect him? Okay. Pretty simple stuff. He said yes. There are some people out\n\n01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:30.440\nthere that are like, oh, he was more of an assimilator. I don't believe you. You're a liar.\n\n01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:38.040\nHe absorbed all of the people, but it's like, yeah. Do you like Joni Mitchell, Anthony?\n\n01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:43.960\nShe was entertaining. Okay, that was a soft response to that one.\n\n01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:51.080\nThere's a lot more said in the silence of that answer. All right, let's pass down Dan. Let's do\n\n01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:54.680\na little fireman lining and pass down the folders here for our characters. Let's bring up Steve\n\n01:40:54.680 --> 01:41:06.120\nLevy so we can play some proper D&D. D&D is a lot like folk music. Yeah, there's a Dungeon Master\n\n01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:13.080\nand Garfunkel. The Dungeon Master is like the Woody Guthrie. Hi, Rob. Hello, Steve. How you doing?\n\n01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:20.760\nI have your wallet. Oh, you just kept bringing him stuff. Yeah. Did he ask you for that? Yeah.\n\n01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:25.480\nOh, my phone was going off and you were worried that something bad was like important. Yeah.\n\n01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:29.880\nAll right. It was just Kate. I was born down the road from here. Did you know that? You were\n\n01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:41.000\nwhat? Oh, yeah. Born down the road. Steve is a Long Island baby. I mean, like he's an island baby\n\n01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.520\nwho is way too long. What were you guys talking about? All right, especially we don't have loads\n\n01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:51.400\nof times. Let's dive right in. Are you ready for one? Do we not? Huh? Do we not? How much time do\n\n01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:58.920\nwe got? We got 20 minutes. Great. That's awesome. All right. Or 30 trillion years, depending on which\n\n01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:04.120\nmetric you want to use. Yeah. And the fact that these people are sitting higher than we are,\n\n01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:08.280\ntime is traveling at a different race. Yeah, they don't realize it. They get a little more\n\n01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:14.520\nshow than the people down here do. Yes. Anthony is perceiving the slowest show of his life.\n\n01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:18.280\nHe will be 71 when he gets out of here.\n\n01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:24.760\nWhen he came here, he and his father were the same age.\n\n01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.560\nWhen he visits his father, he will be 96 years old. Where have you been? I've been traveling.\n\n01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:34.520\nI was in a podcast traveling at the speed of boredom.\n\n01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:39.960\nYou remember that thing they would show that in public? You know, that idea that if you travel at\n\n01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:46.200\nthe speed of light and then you're your twin brother and you come, yeah. Time cop? What's up?\n\n01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:50.920\nYeah. Time copping again? No, no. It's just more like when I was a kid, PBS shows explaining\n\n01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:55.240\nrelativity. It would use it to like with these kind of like time traveling scenarios where an\n\n01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:58.520\nastronaut would go up and travel at the speed of light and come back home. Can we show the clip?\n\n01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:03.880\nWhat was that movie? There's that movie where the kid goes into the spaceship and the spaceship has\n\n01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:09.720\nlike an eyeball in it. Flight of the Navigator. Yeah. I don't think it was that, but okay. That sounds\n\n01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:13.800\nlike exactly what it was. Paul Reumann's voice, the spaceship. I guess. All right, Spenser. No,\n\n01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.760\nI don't think it was that. I think I'm thinking of something else. Flight of the Navigator.\n\n01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:22.920\nI don't think so. Yeah. I don't think so. Are you trying to get punched? Yeah. No, you're in a\n\n01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:29.080\nplanned area at a comic book convention saying what was the name of this movie with the eyeball\n\n01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:34.440\nin the spaceship? They're shouting Flight of the Navigator and you're just provoking them. Yeah. Also,\n\n01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:40.280\nwe are at a tactical disadvantage. They're all above us. All they have to do is take one step\n\n01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:46.280\nforward and they will, it'll be like World War Z. Like they'll just be in Tel Aviv, like on top of us.\n\n01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:55.960\nYeah. Yes, you do. I mean, fight me. I swear to God, I landed on this fucking plane. The second\n\n01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:01.960\nthe plane touched down, I was furious. I was like, God fucking damn it. We got off the plane. We went\n\n01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:07.720\nto the bathroom. I start ripping a goddamn toilet dispenser off the wall or the toilet paper dispenser.\n\n01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:12.200\nI'm like, I'm pulling it off the wall. Like, why isn't it coming off the wall? And then I'm like,\n\n01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:16.600\nwhat are you doing? It's because of that urine color. No, it's because of New York. Fuck this place.\n\n01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:24.360\nOkay. Yeah, I don't give a shit. Okay. All right. There's a guy right there that responded\n\n01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:29.880\nlike that. But for all we know, that's New York for like, yeah, like welcome to the party. Like,\n\n01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:35.560\nit's solidarity. We can't tell no, you're shaking your head. No, that's how you're one of those\n\n01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:40.280\nrare people that's proud of New York. You think that it's the greatest city in the world. I know.\n\n01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:46.440\nI know it's a it's a it's not a brave stance. You know, it is fucking Connecticut.\n\n01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:54.840\nIs that all right? Okay. I just pulled that at a random. Well, that's like, I mean,\n\n01:44:54.840 --> 01:45:02.200\nthat's the worst state, right? What? Florida. Oh, come on. Something wrong with Jersey.\n\n01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:10.200\nYeah, Rhode Island. Rhode Island. Fuck you, Rhode Island. Did you guys pay an ounce of attention\n\n01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:18.360\nto my history lesson? Here you go again. All right, Spencer, brief recap.\n\n01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:25.560\nLast time on Harmontown yesterday. Yeah, you guys didn't hear any of this.\n\n01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:33.240\nWhat happened? Oh, Jesus. You guys, you, you found Patchen's gem.\n\n01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:42.920\nBut you lost Patchen's. I was, I was writing. This is my turn. Okay. I was trying to help.\n\n01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:48.680\nThere's a fire in town that was happening because you guys started a fire in town to,\n\n01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:54.280\nto escape and distract them from you guys trying to kidnap one of the most important figures of\n\n01:45:54.280 --> 01:46:00.440\ntown. So the fire was happening and you guys were missing Patchen's, but you had Patchen's gem,\n\n01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:06.360\nwhich you had gotten to give back to Patchen's. So you look for Patchen's in the town that was on\n\n01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:11.160\nfire, but being on fire, you got distracted by the fire and started fighting the fire.\n\n01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:15.480\nWell, kind of you were looking for Patchen's while everyone else was fighting a fire and you\n\n01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.600\ndidn't want to be distracting. So you're like, let's pretend we're fighting a fire while we're\n\n01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:24.600\ninterrogating the city. Great place to look for Patchen's is at the town fire. It's his time.\n\n01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:32.760\nIt's his time. Yeah. He likes me. I like every putting, except New York. Yeah, I don't like\n\n01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:39.240\nNew York. Yeah, no, I'm not saying that to be popular. Fuck Connecticut. All right, let's go back and\n\n01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:45.800\ntry. Well, what happened afterwards? We put the fire out. Right. That was it. No, you put the fire\n\n01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:50.200\nout. We put the magical fire thing. We put the fire out. You put the fire out. I was writing the\n\n01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:56.680\nbear with them. I was writing the bear. I got Garry Shandling myself got on top of Bearney Mac\n\n01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:03.240\nbecause I had a magic purse with water symbols on it. And I was I was we were I was writing the bear\n\n01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:12.360\naround a burning building going Oh, and and and and quite successfully putting out a lot of the\n\n01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:17.160\nfires. Right. I said you put out the fire, but you didn't say who and you didn't say how. Right.\n\n01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:23.800\nThat's a recap. What do you think, Anthony? It tracks, right? Okay. All right. Anthony seems\n\n01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:30.120\nhappy. He gets it. Yeah. Anthony, what do you do for a living? What do you do for a living?\n\n01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:41.240\nYou build microwave parts that go on satellites and military missiles. I don't think you're supposed\n\n01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:47.240\nto tell people. And some of your stuff is on display here at the at the cradle. Oh, really? Wow. Okay.\n\n01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:58.200\nI'm kind of embarrassed that we're up here. And he's he's like, yeah, I come here every week.\n\n01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:06.360\nI see a lot of respected speakers. Do you own own the building?\n\n01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:12.520\nYeah. Okay. So you see, you're you're an engineer, then. No.\n\n01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:22.920\nEngineering assistant. Fantastic. Oh, yeah, in the army. Fantastic. Let's give it up for Anthony.\n\n01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:34.440\nSo now, Anthony, a a basically a hedge. He's a shambling mound of weeds road on top of a talking\n\n01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:41.720\nbear. This will explain everything. Put out of put out of fire. And it's okay. So hey villagers,\n\n01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:47.880\nI think you noticed that we we atone for our sins. No, you didn't. You're welcome. You're\n\n01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:53.640\nwelcome. You're welcome. Spencer, how does the crowd receive our feet? They look like an angry mob.\n\n01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.640\nEven though that we helped put out the fire, the fire you started after kidnapping the town mayor.\n\n01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:04.760\nSometimes you have to start a fire to put it out.\n\n01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:14.520\nHere here. Oh, give him a break. Look at that guy. Wait, the mayor was the head of the theater.\n\n01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:20.760\nYeah, you guys didn't ask. But yeah, true. Shrove. He was the mayor. Yeah, I thought he was the head\n\n01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:26.760\nof the theater company. Didn't we beat him up in my living room? Yeah. Oh, yikes. Are we\n\n01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:33.560\nsaying this out loud? Is he still in my living room? No. Is he alive? You don't know. But he\n\n01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:39.960\nprobably is. He escaped. Are we saying this out loud in front of the angry mob? Yeah,\n\n01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:47.880\nthey're just watching you. Oh, okay. There has been a regime change in your town. You have lost\n\n01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:53.800\nyour way. Politics ran rampant and became the new religion. Now religion will recalibrate.\n\n01:49:53.800 --> 01:50:00.280\nWe love Shrove, but he got a little full of himself. Admit it, Kevin.\n\n01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:08.120\nI talked to Darlene, a plumber. She said that Shrove wouldn't let her have a part-time job\n\n01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:17.240\nand feed her family. I talked to a nurse that said she has to work part-time as a webcam girl.\n\n01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:28.360\nJust to make buckets. This isn't working. No, it's not. It's anachronistic and it's\n\n01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:39.880\nuncharismatic. Run? Run. What if we have this gem? We have something valuable. All the better\n\n01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:46.680\nreason to run. I give it one last chance. I go, listen, everybody, if someone doesn't\n\n01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:53.320\ntell me right now where Patchens is, it's going to be hell to pay. We're going to bring the\n\n01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:57.960\nfucking thunder. He's going to relight the town on fire. Yeah, you've seen what we can do.\n\n01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:05.320\nWas there a question there? No, no. I say, tell me where somebody here,\n\n01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:12.280\ntell me where Patchens is. No one knows who that is. God damn it. Run, run, run.\n\n01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:19.000\nYeah, he's probably running. Okay, I cast Fireball. That's something that's not on fire\n\n01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:24.360\nand I light another thing on fire. Hold on. What spell? Produce Flame? Fireball.\n\n01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.400\nYou can't cast Fireball. I can't? No. What the fuck? You're not like level seven.\n\n01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:33.400\nOkay, how about this? What about co-executive Produce Flame?\n\n01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:41.080\nOkay. He's got to have that, but now he's guys been working for years. I get all the merchandise.\n\n01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:48.200\nOkay, I produce Flame. All right, you toss a few fire blobs. One of them lands in a dry field\n\n01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:53.960\nthat hasn't been watered. You're going to deny this in your history books, but the truth is,\n\n01:51:53.960 --> 01:52:00.360\nyou did this. Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run. We run.\n\n01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:07.800\nWoo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.\n\n01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:13.640\nI jump on Gary's back. Okay. Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo. You got to do the noise. Woo, woo, woo,\n\n01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:19.160\nwoo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.\n\n01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:24.840\nMost of the town resumes fighting the fire, but they don't even care.\n\n01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:32.040\nNo, most of the town. Three bulky looking, farmer looking dudes just tear ass after you,\n\n01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:36.280\nthough. They're just chasing you. You make it out of the town and they're still chasing you.\n\n01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:44.600\nThat was their mistake. I take my bow and I aim at them and I shoot them from Garry Shandling's back.\n\n01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:48.760\nOkay. Does anyone else want to do anything while you're running away?\n\n01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:52.440\nWell, what's our friend's name? Our overreactive friend who now doesn't...\n\n01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:56.600\nGeffen. Geffen. Oh, Summon Geffen. He's crazy.\n\n01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:02.040\nOh, no. So as you're running away, you hear the hoof beats returning and you hear the skulls\n\n01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:08.040\nsmashing of... Oh, my gosh....of Geffen. See, this is... I meant to mention this recap. Also,\n\n01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:12.040\nwhile you were trying to convince everyone to stop the fire, Geffen from the church came\n\n01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:18.040\nand started murdering people and you kind of had to stop him. Right. But now he's back murdering\n\n01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:23.640\npeople again. He's sort of the Agent Orange of our unwinnable war. Yeah. That's a great way to\n\n01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:27.080\nlook at it. That doesn't give you flashbacks, Anthony. You're right. You're right. Oh, man.\n\n01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:32.040\nWhat should I do? Wow. Wow. I don't know. What if it did? All right. Well, if you...\n\n01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:37.240\nHilarious. Keep going. Do I successfully hit one of the farmers?\n\n01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:44.440\nWere you in the shit, Anthony? You were? Okay. I feel bad. He said he was in the army.\n\n01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:47.960\nWell, I didn't know that meant Vietnam automatically. Were you in Vietnam?\n\n01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:57.640\n1967, 1977. Oh, my God. Did you... Did you see actual combat? Were you...\n\n01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:02.680\nAll right. I'm sorry. Oh, wow. That's so cool. He keeps getting cooler.\n\n01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:09.800\nThis is insane. It's been two hours and he's only gotten cooler. All right. If my joke didn't\n\n01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:22.520\ntraumatize you, nod your head. You... Fuck. I can't blame him. These people will turn on me.\n\n01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:33.240\nHave some empathy. I'm truly sorry if... He's gonna... He's gonna...\n\n01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:38.600\nI didn't mean to trivialize any personal experience that you had. Like, that would make me feel terrible.\n\n01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:44.920\nJust let it go. Oh, my God. Keep digging. No, I'm accountable and I fucking... I pivot.\n\n01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:55.960\nYou're escaping the town. And DJ just fired up a boat, right? Yeah. You see DJ loose an arrow.\n\n01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:02.920\nIt's hard to do because you're on the back of a biped running. Hell yeah. Yeah. All right. You miss.\n\n01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:08.920\nNice shot, though. Thanks. I'm just impressed. I was even able to get it off. Yeah. So,\n\n01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:16.040\nthree guys, we can just turn and fight these guys. Hey, I'm Gary. What? I'm sorry. Yeah, we met.\n\n01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:22.040\nWe... I'm diarrhea. Okay. We never officially met. I'd be at my best if they were skeletons,\n\n01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:29.320\nbut everyone is a skeleton deep down. I love that optimism.\n\n01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:38.600\nAll right. Knowing that I'm not gonna be able to run faster than farmhands, I stop and face them.\n\n01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:47.560\nAll right. Gentlemen, the wrath of God is not something we walk away from.\n\n01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:52.200\nAll right. One of them stabs you in the chest with a pitchfork.\n\n01:55:52.200 --> 01:56:02.440\nYou're wearing armor, though, so you take five damage. Carlos, no.\n\n01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.840\nGary, turn around. We got to go back and help our friend. Hold on. Let me make a Y turn here.\n\n01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:13.320\nOh, that's true. You're doing a stop top. All right. Well, did Jeff stop too, right?\n\n01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:19.800\nYeah. Okay. So too. I summon nature's ally.\n\n01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:24.600\nOkay. I think you're out of that. Where's Barney Mack in all this? He's here.\n\n01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:30.440\nI feel like I must be out of every spell. Yeah. Okay. I just go old school. Can I do\n\n01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:35.640\nShalely? Or am I out of spells right now? I think you... What level of spell is Shalely?\n\n01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:42.120\nShalely is... Sorry, everybody. Is it level one? It better be. Yeah, it is. Level one.\n\n01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:46.840\nThen you have... That's your last spell left if I'm... Okay. I go Shalely and I just go full\n\n01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:53.720\non Noam Druid Shalely attack. All right. You cast Shalely and it makes your staff turn into a Shalely.\n\n01:56:53.720 --> 01:57:02.040\nThat's what she said. That's certainly a level one spell. That's like casting hammer on a nail.\n\n01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:07.320\nI was just like, well, or I could go to a hardware store. It gives it more damage.\n\n01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:15.160\nSo I attack the nearest foe. Ah, you got to cast it first. So that was your turn just casting it.\n\n01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:20.200\nOf what? That's magic, bro. You got to plan ahead. All right. I'm standing there with a\n\n01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:28.520\nhalf cast Shalely. No, it's fully cast. Okay. So I enjoy some lemonade. It's great.\n\n01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:38.440\nSchrab. I use one of my feet. I cleave at the closest one. I cleave them. All right.\n\n01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:45.160\nGood shambling mound cleave. Swinging a mighty haymaker. You smash the guy in the face, but it's\n\n01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:54.760\nnot enough to kill him. So it doesn't cleave. Does he... He takes 14 damage. Yeah. I'll take it.\n\n01:57:55.960 --> 01:58:03.720\nHe drops to his knees like stunned and dazed. He's like a dizzy. It didn't have to be like this.\n\n01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:08.040\nThe other two round to round with their weapons. They're just kind of knives like kitchen knives,\n\n01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:12.680\nnot even like daggers. And they start attacking at you guys, but a little sad, isn't it? Yeah,\n\n01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:17.720\nit is. That's what you notice. I want to write a letter home to my grandma. I think we're the\n\n01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:23.720\nbad guys who the real enemy is. All right. Somebody says something witty because the show is basically\n\n01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:32.120\nover. You get stabbed in the face. Oh, that wasn't witty enough. Or I've burned through all my\n\n01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:40.360\ncredibility with the audience. I can't tell. Can I morning star one of these fellows? Oh, yeah.\n\n01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:49.720\nThe guy is still dazed from the impact from the shambling mound and you find it very easy to drive\n\n01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:55.960\nyour morning star into his head. This just feels so... Why are you... You know you have free will.\n\n01:58:56.760 --> 01:59:01.880\nYou're choosing these actions. The choice is between getting stabbed with a butcher knife\n\n01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:07.560\nor killing a farmer whose weapon is a butcher knife. Those are two choices. It's a purek victory\n\n01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:15.080\nor an actual death. I open up my glass jar of Dracula ash. Relatively blunt weapon.\n\n01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:25.000\nYeah, you open it. Okay. I open up my glass jar of Dracula ash and I just start throwing it in the\n\n01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:32.280\nair like confetti and going, yeah, we're doing it. We're doing it. All right. It's great. Everyone\n\n01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:40.360\nstarts coughing. Cliffhanger. Thank you so much, everybody. All right. Thank you for coming out\n\n01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:47.320\nof CradleCon at the Cradle of Aviation Museum. Thank you, Anthony Jr. and Anthony III.\n\n01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:50.520\nThank you to Isabel for coming down there and helping us out.\n\n01:59:50.520 --> 02:00:00.120\nYou guys were wonderful. It's been a long day and it culminated in a wonderful intimate little\n\n02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:03.400\nspaulding gray show. I loved it. Thank you to Rob on Sound. Down here we're getting\n\n02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:12.360\nsplashed by the entrance of Rob Schrab, everybody. Steve Levy. Spencer Crittenden.\n\n02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:18.280\nI'm Jeff Davis of Comptroller. Your mayor is Dan Harmon. Give it up for Dan Harmon, everybody.\n\n02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:28.280\nThank you so much, y'all. Drive fast and take chances.\n\n02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:46.280\nDid you get any of that?\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[133392]}
