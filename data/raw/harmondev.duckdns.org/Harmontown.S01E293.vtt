WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.320
I just look behind me and what we're the fuck are we somewhere in the middle of outer space

00:11.320 --> 00:25.120
or in the leafy groves of Long Island New York from the fantabulous cradle of aviation

00:25.120 --> 00:35.520
Museum here in Long Island Harmontown is now in session.

00:35.520 --> 00:40.600
He at the National Treasure would you please welcome into the cosmos of your mind the Game

00:40.600 --> 00:53.040
Master Spencer Crittenden.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.920
Thank you, thank you.

00:54.920 --> 00:55.920
What's up Spencer?

00:55.920 --> 00:58.840
I don't know man, what's up with you?

00:58.840 --> 00:59.840
Not too much.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.840
There's one other thing I forgot to mention.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.840
Uh oh.

01:02.840 --> 01:07.920
careening to the cosmic vapor of invention that is the beautiful realm of dark matter

01:07.920 --> 01:14.360
and light matter combined together to stretch and expand your mind and space time itself.

01:14.360 --> 01:30.960
Please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.wn.

01:30.960 --> 01:38.160
Hello universe.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.560
Hello Milky Way.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.560
Thank you, thank you.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.560
Wow.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.520
There's one guy yelling out that I looked.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.080
Your way loss worked.

01:48.080 --> 01:49.080
Yeah.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.160
I'm not insulting you, just repeating.

01:52.160 --> 01:58.200
It's something that I need to hear after a couple days of pizza and stuff.

01:58.200 --> 02:02.720
I mean you did look thin but then again against the backdrop of all time and space.

02:02.720 --> 02:03.720
Oh yeah.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.840
Everybody looks thin against the interior cosmos.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.800
Light is actually bending around Dan right now, it makes him look smaller.

02:09.800 --> 02:13.240
Why do you think Neil deGrasse Tyson picked this light at work?

02:13.240 --> 02:19.240
I mean the guy's a little thick in the caboose, so he wants to stand next to Charizard.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.440
Yeah exactly.

02:22.440 --> 02:27.520
Everybody's sitting next to a horse head nebula.

02:27.520 --> 02:32.040
Well thanks for coming and I doubt that you guys have probably been at a convention all

02:32.040 --> 02:34.040
day today most of you, right?

02:34.040 --> 02:40.160
And I think a lot of the folks here stood in line for a while, we're at the signing.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.160
Too long.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.160
Yeah.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.160
Thank you so much.

02:43.160 --> 02:48.320
We've got a house full of dedicated fans and for those who are listening to this later,

02:48.320 --> 02:55.720
and it's this virtually vertical raked planetarium that we're in.

02:55.720 --> 03:00.920
It's like an IMAX except it's just three dudes.

03:00.920 --> 03:06.640
It's a wall of people, like the people in the second row are only a little bit behind

03:06.640 --> 03:10.080
the people in the first row, they're mostly above them.

03:10.080 --> 03:14.960
So it's sort of like you could climb their faces.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.960
Is it possible to fire up the planetarium so we can have like the Pleiades and shit

03:18.960 --> 03:19.960
behind us?

03:19.960 --> 03:26.480
I mean, I'm almost certainly interest, no, but I just like, because behind us for the

03:26.480 --> 03:34.880
listener that there is just this giant, like yeah, empty void, it's pretty groovy.

03:34.880 --> 03:45.160
Yeah, I don't think, I don't think, I don't think spontaneous nation.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.160
You want a drink, Dan?

03:46.160 --> 03:47.160
Yeah.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.800
Why don't you talk and I'll conjure up a cocktail for you.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.040
Oh, okay.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.040
That's teamwork.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.760
This is the partnership.

03:55.760 --> 04:03.160
In the beginning, as you know, there was there was nothing, which means there was no time,

04:03.160 --> 04:09.040
which means that there was infinite time, which means there was 100% chance of anything

04:09.040 --> 04:14.680
happening, including a whole universe, which was spontaneously brought into existence in

04:14.680 --> 04:23.160
the form of a tiny particle, exactly the density of infinity, which then exploded into everything.

04:23.160 --> 04:28.280
And will one day either collapse or suck back in on itself.

04:28.280 --> 04:35.960
And in the meantime, here we are for our brief few frames in a very, very high speed camera

04:35.960 --> 04:41.120
shot of an explosion that is lasting 80 trillion years.

04:41.120 --> 04:45.760
And in that giant, vast expanse of what we consider time, some of us have chosen to

04:45.760 --> 04:49.000
dress like Deadpool for the evening.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.520
That's how big this explosion is, is that a one new way is giving me Miami flashbacks

04:54.520 --> 04:55.520
though.

04:55.520 --> 05:01.800
I remember we were talking about Deadpool when someone leapt from the audience and punched.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.200
I don't think this is that kind of crowd.

05:04.200 --> 05:08.960
I think if you guys had reached the point of your psychosis, I didn't think it was that

05:08.960 --> 05:12.960
kind of crowd until like 20 people were like, no, no, not at all.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.960
That's not me.

05:14.960 --> 05:23.240
Well, come on, these are these are planetarium folk, they're triggered by people behind desks

05:23.240 --> 05:27.720
questioning their sanity, like that's the guidance counselors and things like it.

05:27.720 --> 05:31.840
The difference between being held back in third grade and being moved up to sixth grade

05:31.840 --> 05:38.840
is like whether the principal's IQ is 90 or 95, right?

05:38.840 --> 05:43.000
My mom often told me this story, she's like, they wanted to hold you back in kindergarten.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.720
Like I had to go and yell at the principal.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.360
The principal was like, he's like, he can't walk on a balance beam.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.320
She's like, he can read college textbooks.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.560
He's like, he can't use scissors.

05:53.560 --> 05:58.720
She's like, what is this like, what is the society he's going to enter where he's going

05:58.720 --> 06:07.440
to like walk down a log and and and wrap everyone's Christmas gifts, but but but and illiteracy

06:07.440 --> 06:08.720
would be fine for that.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.840
But like, like, like, you just put him in first grade, he'll be fine.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.560
How many balance beams are waiting for him out there in the world?

06:15.560 --> 06:18.240
I am pretty bad at balancing and using scissors.

06:18.240 --> 06:22.440
I couldn't tie my shoes, couldn't tell time, very bad at math.

06:22.440 --> 06:27.800
But yeah, boy, boy, howdy, could I read?

06:27.800 --> 06:31.000
Just like you guys, right?

06:31.000 --> 06:35.640
Do we got any literates in the house?

06:35.640 --> 06:38.240
Where my illiterates at?

06:38.240 --> 06:43.680
Where's my dyslexia?

06:43.680 --> 06:44.680
Pretty evenly dispersed.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.680
That's good.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.680
Yeah.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.520
Yeah, exactly three, three thirds.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.440
I had a forgive my energy.

06:50.440 --> 06:55.960
I had I'm in Long Island, so I had a Long Island iced tea and dinner and what you actually

06:55.960 --> 06:56.960
did.

06:56.960 --> 06:57.960
Yeah.

06:57.960 --> 07:04.480
For those who don't know how to make a Long Island iced tea, you take a 16 year old in

07:04.480 --> 07:05.960
their parents kitchen.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.880
Well, the parents are out of town.

07:08.880 --> 07:14.760
You open the cupboard and you pour whatever's in there because you don't want any of the

07:14.760 --> 07:17.640
bottles to reveal that you took any of them.

07:17.640 --> 07:23.040
So then you end up with a full cup of every liquor in the cabinet and that's a Long Island

07:23.040 --> 07:24.280
iced tea.

07:24.280 --> 07:30.640
You tend to drink them when you're younger because you know how to order them.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.240
It's like you can't get that words wrong.

07:32.240 --> 07:36.960
No one's going to go, you're not 21 the way you said Long Island iced tea.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.320
You must be a bachelorette.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.640
One Long Island iced tea coming up.

07:43.640 --> 07:47.480
The Long Island, of course, is not that long.

07:47.480 --> 07:51.080
This is a Viking, goes back to Viking times.

07:51.080 --> 07:57.120
People that didn't want the Vikings to find Long Island would tell them it's very Long

07:57.120 --> 07:58.120
Island.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.120
You can't miss it.

07:59.120 --> 08:05.160
Just, of course, hoping that the Vikings would end up in New Jersey, which they did.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.400
I don't know anything about geography.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.400
And they had long boats.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.400
Yeah.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.880
You'd think that that would have worked out.

08:09.880 --> 08:13.080
They're like, are you sure we shouldn't be really precise in our aiming toward Long

08:13.080 --> 08:14.080
Island?

08:14.080 --> 08:15.080
No, you don't.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.080
Just go wide.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.080
It's a Long Island.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.080
It's not that long.

08:18.080 --> 08:27.520
It's just a very crafty, pre-Cambrian Atlanteans that wanted to protect Long Island and its

08:27.520 --> 08:28.520
culture.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.560
We're in Nassau County, am I correct?

08:32.560 --> 08:33.560
Yeah.

08:33.560 --> 08:38.160
Nassau is a Native American word meaning rich white people.

08:38.160 --> 08:41.720
It hurts.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.640
People don't know that.

08:43.640 --> 08:47.720
You guys came here for the fucking truth, and that's what you're going to get tonight.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.720
Yeah.

08:48.720 --> 08:56.240
I mean, matter can't exist in the same place, and you have privilege.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.240
It's all saying science.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.240
Exactly.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.240
Yeah.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.240
Truth is truth.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.240
You can't just take the parts you like.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.240
I thought you were joking.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.240
Look, that was a lot of emails to be deleted.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.800
I thought you were joking at dinner about the Long Island ST.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.400
I thought you were just musing what you actually are.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.960
Yeah, because I talked about it so much, I was like, well, of course, the Long Island

09:12.960 --> 09:17.280
ST is out on the menu, and I was like, oh, Long Island STs, and as I was explaining how

09:17.280 --> 09:22.840
much I would never drink one again, it kind of made me nostalgic.

09:22.840 --> 09:25.200
You talk about a drink long enough to get an order one.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.200
Do they make them better here?

09:26.200 --> 09:27.600
Do you think this is like...

09:27.600 --> 09:33.120
I tasted like the same kind of beverage that I remember from 20 years ago.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.520
You know, it's a long...

09:35.520 --> 09:36.520
Yeah.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.520
I didn't finish it.

09:37.520 --> 09:46.680
I'll have a pretty bad hangover tomorrow, but I tried to, man, I don't want to be anticlimactic

09:46.680 --> 09:53.920
with it, because I was trying on the plane, I was trying to write a Long Island song.

09:53.920 --> 09:59.200
When we were in Boston, Dan wrote a Boston song, and it was listening to the episode.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.200
It was good.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.120
It was acapella, but this time, and I had, like...

10:02.120 --> 10:07.840
But you actually concocted the...

10:07.840 --> 10:10.640
Yeah, that's why I was like...

10:10.640 --> 10:13.640
It's more of an emotional thing, isn't it?

10:13.640 --> 10:16.800
Long Island, rest your weary head...

10:16.800 --> 10:20.800
Wait, no, wait, sorry about that.

10:20.800 --> 10:25.200
Long Island, rest your weary face...

10:25.200 --> 10:28.200
It's too long for too long now...

10:28.200 --> 10:37.200
Long Island, you're in outer space, it's just a song for Long Island, Long Island be with

10:37.200 --> 10:53.720
me, Long Island take a pee, Long Island frolic in costume, while you wait in line, Long Island,

10:53.720 --> 11:03.360
how long will you wait to be a part of the country, and not just an island, to me you're

11:03.360 --> 11:18.040
a peninsula, Long Island I love you, Long Island are you, really that long at all, winter,

11:18.040 --> 11:32.120
spring, summer, fall, give me a call, new phone, who dis, all right.

11:32.120 --> 11:36.440
Some of that I wrote just now.

11:36.440 --> 11:40.560
Who's up there on light effects, because that was pretty special, because that was like the

11:40.560 --> 11:44.640
encore of a journey concert.

11:44.640 --> 11:51.560
I want to plug the app that I use there, because it only seems fair, but also I kind of don't

11:51.560 --> 11:56.200
want to, because it feels like it's my secret weapon with songwriting, it's called Chordbot,

11:56.200 --> 12:04.640
it's a really good app, if you're not musically trained, but you only know, oh, I need chords

12:04.640 --> 12:12.200
and I need to know which chords work together, and it's a cool app, you can quickly move

12:12.200 --> 12:14.320
chords around and hear if they work together.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.880
So was that whole song in that, or did you make chords and then move them into a garage

12:17.880 --> 12:18.880
band or something?

12:18.880 --> 12:23.440
That was just Chordbot doing it, you can be very simple, you can just play tones, and

12:23.440 --> 12:29.320
you can, it's got enough sophistication, did you make that sound because you're exhausted,

12:29.320 --> 12:31.320
you just hate that.

12:31.320 --> 12:42.720
Sorry, that's the lead programmer on GarageBand, it's going to be a long day at work tomorrow.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.600
This is Chordbot we're hearing about from the Long Island District.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.280
You had one job last night.

12:49.280 --> 12:54.720
Keep harming on GarageBand, it's just harder, I imagine GarageBand is probably a lot easier

12:54.720 --> 12:59.440
for people that actually understand music, but like GarageBand you have to like poke

12:59.440 --> 13:05.320
and swipe and poop around in order to just say, well what if this was an A-sharp instead

13:05.320 --> 13:12.280
of an A-flat, yeah, that's a bad app.

13:12.280 --> 13:19.400
I work at Apple, I quit working for Dan, I went back to Apple.

13:19.400 --> 13:25.920
Let's see if I have any, what if I lost you and then I found you there, I come into the

13:25.920 --> 13:34.320
Apple store and I'm like, can we help you, I'm like, yeah, I have a broken friendship.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.520
Did you make an appointment?

13:36.520 --> 13:44.160
Yeah, I thought I did, but it turns out maybe it's expensive, and it's just like muscle

13:44.160 --> 13:50.080
through and they're like, security's coming and then you're like, it's alright, it's fine,

13:50.080 --> 13:53.360
he has an appointment.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.720
At the emotional genius bar.

13:56.720 --> 14:11.320
No, it's Dan, yeah, let's see, I'm just looking for, this is song fragments, Long Island up

14:11.320 --> 14:22.560
and down, Long Island come to town, Long Island singer song, Long Island make your island

14:22.560 --> 14:32.000
long, I remember when I was a kid, I was briefly living in Manhattan and a friend of mine lived

14:32.000 --> 14:36.680
somewhere in Nassau County and it was 4th of July and we had all these sparklers and

14:36.680 --> 14:42.000
like smoke bombs and like kind of low grade fireworks and we went, like the parents were

14:42.000 --> 14:46.480
doing their thing and getting drunk and making food and stuff, so me and my friend Luke,

14:46.480 --> 14:54.240
no not Luke, David, we were, doesn't matter, you don't fucking know him, and we went, there

14:54.240 --> 14:59.920
was a telephone pole and it was like giant ants were living inside it, there's little

14:59.920 --> 15:04.920
fissures and cracks inside old telephone poles, they're kind of tarred and whatnot and there's

15:04.920 --> 15:08.920
these big ants living inside it, moving around, so we started sticking smoke bombs in there

15:08.920 --> 15:13.160
and there's like all these ants would come out and so we thought that was really fascinating

15:13.160 --> 15:18.920
and so we kept doing it to see like what ecosystem existed inside this telephone pole and then

15:18.920 --> 15:24.720
it caught on fire, so we caught a hole, we caught a hole and it's made of tar, yeah it's

15:24.720 --> 15:30.440
got all that oil in it, so the fire department had a real tough time on that one, cause you

15:30.440 --> 15:33.280
guys were like, well it's not a fire bomb, it's a smoke bomb, they're like, how do you

15:33.280 --> 15:42.440
think you make smoke, there's fire in the bomb, stuck it in a big piece of wood and ants,

15:42.440 --> 15:46.320
that's like how they used to really make fire before, I think me and my friend, we just

15:46.320 --> 15:51.760
hid in the bush and took no credit for it, cowardly, yeah I told them, me and my friend

15:51.760 --> 15:59.600
Dan Ramstack, we made a, when we were like 10 years old, we took batteries and light

15:59.600 --> 16:04.680
bulbs and we like made this like blinky thing with electrical tape that we, I don't think,

16:04.680 --> 16:08.200
I don't know if we wanted it to look like a bomb, I really don't, I think we wanted

16:08.200 --> 16:14.120
it to just look like a crazy sci-fi thing and we like taped it to the screen door of

16:14.120 --> 16:19.800
a girl that lived in the neighborhood, I guess that was our way of saying, I love you, we

16:19.800 --> 16:27.040
would like to kiss you one day, here's a blinky device, but her father came to the door and

16:27.040 --> 16:30.640
called the bomb squad, or I got called the police and they called the bomb squad and

16:30.640 --> 16:39.080
they were like people everywhere, flashlights and assault rifles and pliers and we just

16:39.080 --> 16:46.760
sat at a swing porch and watched and my mom was like, did you guys, no, I mean like what

16:46.760 --> 16:51.840
are we supposed to do, say yes, like we're gonna get more than beaten, we're gonna get

16:51.840 --> 16:58.160
shot, like these people, it wasn't our idea that Johnny Gove would get involved, she just

16:58.160 --> 17:07.800
wanted a kiss, just wanted to, just wanted to call in the bomb threat of affection, this

17:07.800 --> 17:13.960
was before me too, it was a perfectly acceptable way to call upon a young lady, she plant a

17:13.960 --> 17:21.560
bomb on her father's door, back in the late 70s, early 80s, nothing said, will you be

17:21.560 --> 17:26.880
mine, these days it's so complicated, like are you supposed to use a Molotov cocktail

17:26.880 --> 17:31.840
or like, what happened to romance, the flashbang, we used to go, I don't know, I want to do

17:31.840 --> 17:36.920
what the right thing is, but I'm trying my best, I just, I don't know what it is anymore,

17:36.920 --> 17:45.080
I'm sorry, I feel like we've talked about in the very early days of Harmontown of colonizing

17:45.080 --> 17:48.440
the moon, I think this is the closest that we've gotten, we're here in the planetarium,

17:48.440 --> 17:59.040
we were on the moon, yeah, stars, that's the problem, the lights are washing out the

17:59.040 --> 18:05.760
planetarium, can we kill the side lights, that'd be bad for our subscribers, that sounds

18:05.760 --> 18:35.600
like a distraction, we can't see up there, Jesus, we can't see, from a distant nebula,

18:35.600 --> 19:04.440
oh Jesus Christ, what happened, I can't see anything, just a giant trash can, are you

19:04.440 --> 19:20.440
okay, Rob Schrab, all right, well again, I was going to bring you up, I had a thing

19:20.440 --> 19:27.280
kind of planned out, it didn't work, did you fall down the stairs, because it sounded like

19:27.280 --> 19:37.600
you did and I only saw darkness, a giant trash can came down this 70 degree slope, Rob on

19:37.600 --> 19:43.680
sound here, he got completely splashed by just miscellaneous liquids, I thought there

19:43.680 --> 19:49.600
would be tape on the stairs, I didn't want to expect, no offense, but I thought Rob was

19:49.600 --> 19:59.480
Rob, Rob, will you stand up for a second and just, don't touch him, don't touch him,

19:59.480 --> 20:04.440
what did we tell you about matter, what did time come, you want this whole place to go

20:04.440 --> 20:11.800
time cop, oh man, now I had, I mean like, they didn't have my lab, I tried to go for

20:11.800 --> 20:20.360
it, it was supposed to be big, a beautiful star, God 25 years, didn't work out the way

20:20.360 --> 20:24.080
I planned it, I'm really sorry, I'm sorry you got splashed, but you made the stars happen

20:24.080 --> 20:28.160
though, was that part of your, yeah, that was just the beginning of it, it only got better

20:28.160 --> 20:33.360
after that, I tripped and I fell down and I hit, so you did fall down the stairs, well

20:33.360 --> 20:37.760
I hurt, yeah I hurt myself if you're curious, yeah I was, I asked if you're okay and you

20:37.760 --> 20:43.400
just stared off into space, I hit my head a couple of times, great damage, I'm so sorry,

20:43.400 --> 20:48.760
don't you already have like a hairline fracture all the way down your skull from when you

20:48.760 --> 20:54.560
saw Teen Wolf when you were in college and tried to do a stand stand on the top of a

20:54.560 --> 21:02.400
moving car, yes, when I was, when I was, when I was in high school, when I was in high

21:02.400 --> 21:12.600
school, we watched Teen Wolf, I wrote that, I wrote that movie, in the, in the theater

21:12.600 --> 21:17.680
and then we went, wow that looks like cool, not turning into a wolf but, or playing basketball

21:17.680 --> 21:22.680
but, turning into a wolf just seems like a path to growth, yeah, it seems like you'll

21:22.680 --> 21:25.880
just learn you don't want to turn into a wolf as much as you want to respect your friends,

21:25.880 --> 21:30.560
yeah so we, this car surfing thing however, car surfing thing, this is really going to

21:30.560 --> 21:37.400
take off, so Corey Yacht is Dan Calo and myself started driving, Dan Calo's car, driving,

21:37.400 --> 21:42.000
driving down Mabel like back roads and stuff where there was no like lights or anything

21:42.000 --> 21:48.560
as a farm area and Corey goes on first and he's like, yeah, well, I feel I'm the top

21:48.560 --> 21:53.000
of the world, yeah, king of the world, you know, and then, and then, and then he goes,

21:53.000 --> 21:58.360
okay, sure, but it's your turn and then as he gets off he goes, dude, when the car stops,

21:58.360 --> 22:04.400
pretend like you're falling off, it'll freak out Dan Calo who's driving the car and so

22:04.400 --> 22:08.600
I'm like, yeah, king of the world and then Dan Calo comes to a stop and then every single

22:08.600 --> 22:15.360
thing went black and I woke up three hours later in Dan Calo's living room with Corey

22:15.360 --> 22:23.000
holding like a, like a, like a wad of newspaper and it was like blood and, and he goes, what

22:23.000 --> 22:27.120
do you want, are you okay, do you want to go to the hospital, no, I just want to go home

22:27.120 --> 22:34.080
and go to sleep and they went, well, okay, it's either this or this are getting in trouble

22:34.080 --> 22:41.000
and they put me in a bed and I fell asleep with a huge concussion, but my skull was cracked.

22:41.000 --> 22:47.200
Yeah, empathy is, is I think a learned trait, like, I don't think kids, kids are sociopaths

22:47.200 --> 22:50.240
because they might be Spartans, you know, like they don't know, like the human being

22:50.240 --> 22:54.560
is designed to adapt to whatever society they're going to be and as the human society's moral

22:54.560 --> 22:59.520
compass might be based on the complete dispensability of human life.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.520
Yes.

23:00.520 --> 23:04.120
Well, everybody's so afraid of getting into trouble and getting yelled at that you're

23:04.120 --> 23:09.600
willing to let one of your friends go to sleep and wake up not breathing.

23:09.600 --> 23:15.960
We had, we had a treehouse in Stan Frankie's backyard when I was in Milwaukee and uh, Stan

23:15.960 --> 23:16.960
Frankie.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.600
You had, you had Stan Frankie, I had Warren, you had Stan Frankie, I had Warren Stanky.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.600
Right.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.920
So, we're sitting in Stan Frankie's treehouse.

23:24.920 --> 23:25.920
Warren Stanky, Warren Stanky.

23:25.920 --> 23:26.920
My favorite fuck band.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.520
And Dave Bublitz comes over.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.520
Dave Bublitz.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.520
Dave Bublitz.

23:30.520 --> 23:31.520
Dave Bublitz, everybody.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.520
For your consideration.

23:32.520 --> 23:37.080
He's from around the way, you know, he lives all the way up Calumet, like, he's like a different

23:37.080 --> 23:41.720
click, you know, he wasn't like one of our Stranger Things tribe, he was like an ancillary

23:41.720 --> 23:46.640
character and so he made a convenient, like, oh, let's not leave, let's not let Dave Bublitz

23:46.640 --> 23:52.640
up the tree and we're, and we're like Dave Bublitz, you can't come, he's like, I want

23:52.640 --> 23:53.640
to come up there.

23:53.640 --> 23:54.640
I want to come be up in your treehouse.

23:54.640 --> 23:59.400
We're like, you're not, you're not 52nd Street material.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.400
This is our plywood.

24:00.400 --> 24:05.120
This is our tree and uh, and he's like, I'm coming up and we're like, suit yourself.

24:05.120 --> 24:10.240
And I don't, it was like, we, I, this is where it gets sketchy because it's like, I don't

24:10.240 --> 24:13.840
know if, okay, it's 9-11.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.840
It's 9-11.

24:14.840 --> 24:22.400
I'm telling you the story of Dave Bublitz is 9-11, uh, unless he grew up and became

24:22.400 --> 24:31.080
of a terrorist New York, uh, investor, but, but, uh, don't groan when after you shout

24:31.080 --> 24:37.040
out 9-11 in the middle of my story, you people go, go, go get your own moral compass.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.880
So he's climbing up the thing and I don't know, I can't, I think I feel like when you're

24:40.880 --> 24:46.320
a kid and you, you do fucked up things, like, you know, you feel so guilty that I think

24:46.320 --> 24:51.680
you can, you whitewash, you, you, I think you alter the memory because my memory of

24:51.680 --> 24:56.200
it is that it was a total accident, like a Wiley Coyote, Rube Goldberg thing.

24:56.200 --> 25:01.960
But I have a feeling from what I know of how evil children are that this was an intentional

25:01.960 --> 25:07.000
thing that we just didn't anticipate, like having the results that it did where there

25:07.000 --> 25:13.320
was like a two by four up there that was like just laying and, and there was an incline

25:13.320 --> 25:23.160
and as, as Dave Bublitz, uh, forehead crested the, uh, the threshold, um, uh, coming up

25:23.160 --> 25:29.480
that this two by four in my memory just happened to choose that time to slide, like, right

25:29.480 --> 25:30.480
for it.

25:30.480 --> 25:35.360
But that's, I'm, I'm like, let's be accountable and just even assume, let's blackwash if

25:35.360 --> 25:40.400
that's the opposite of whitewashing this like history because like I, I, I bet somebody

25:40.400 --> 25:48.240
was like, you know, like, like, and this two by four slid and it, and it, and it, and it

25:48.240 --> 25:51.400
hit Dave Bublitz squarely in the forehead.

25:51.400 --> 25:56.120
And then I remember this, like he, he had this look on his face and then I remember

25:56.120 --> 26:01.080
this tiniest little red dot on his forehead, like immediately start getting bigger and

26:01.080 --> 26:06.680
bigger and then, and then he like fell and, and then, and then started shrieking and we

26:06.680 --> 26:14.720
all like clamber down out of the tree and, and, and, and he's like, ah, ah, ah, uh, Stan

26:14.720 --> 26:15.880
goes into the house.

26:15.880 --> 26:22.640
He comes out with like a lot of paper towels, um, and he hands it to Dave who like, we're

26:22.640 --> 26:28.480
all like eight years old or something and Dave like takes the paper towels and he touches

26:28.480 --> 26:34.440
them to his forehead and then he pulls it back and he sees solid red paper towel laying

26:34.440 --> 26:43.200
and he, he just goes absolutely insane and more so than he already had and, and he runs

26:43.200 --> 26:49.400
for his dirt bike and we all instinctively just run for our dirt bikes with him and just

26:49.400 --> 26:59.760
like give him a ineffective police escort to his home where he's just shrieking and there's

26:59.760 --> 27:06.440
like paper towels like trailing like he's just, and we're all just like blue angels

27:06.440 --> 27:15.440
like flanking him just like, like riding up the hill, the Calumet and then like screaming

27:15.440 --> 27:20.720
the entire way so every, every person weed whacking is stopping their weed whacking to

27:20.720 --> 27:21.720
see what's going on.

27:21.720 --> 27:26.200
There's just a kid with bloody paper towels like flying behind him as he gets to his home

27:26.200 --> 27:32.120
there's our little suburban front yards like he, he, you know, when you were a kid, you

27:32.120 --> 27:36.720
just like ditch your bike, he just, he just like gets to the front yard, ditches his bike

27:36.720 --> 27:42.080
and runs as his mom comes out into the porch and, and, and into her arms with his bloody

27:42.080 --> 27:48.120
forehead and, and, and we all just kind of like, like just kept riding just, we just,

27:48.120 --> 27:57.640
we had one job just see him home safe permission to buzz the tower so, so you, you, you weren't

27:57.640 --> 28:02.800
a part of the two by four, you, I look, I probably were, I don't, I'm telling you the

28:02.800 --> 28:06.800
honest, somebody projected this thing towards him and kicked it at him, well what I'm telling

28:06.800 --> 28:14.680
you is my memory of it sincerely is that the two by four just like moved like, and I'm,

28:14.680 --> 28:18.920
and I'm a 45 year old man going what is the likelihood of that, you know, like, like there

28:18.920 --> 28:22.760
was already, that's a hat on a hat as we say in the writer's room like, like, like, like

28:22.760 --> 28:30.320
there was already a story happening here and like we were, we had malice toward this incursion

28:30.320 --> 28:37.080
and, and so I just feel like whether, whether we thought it would, you know, like, like,

28:37.080 --> 28:40.560
our physics were based on cartoons or something, I have a feeling that we were like, well,

28:40.560 --> 28:46.800
let's just do this as he comes up, you know, like, like, I, I just, it's my 45 year old

28:46.800 --> 28:54.600
like, like, you know, cynical suspicion and also a little bit of like middle-aged accountability

28:54.600 --> 28:59.320
like, I'm going like, how is, how likely is it that, that, that my memory has actually

28:59.320 --> 29:04.720
altered Blade Runner style to remove accountability? Because I've told the story of this podcast

29:04.720 --> 29:13.000
too, like, we almost, I was like, I remember like, like, deciding to and executing the

29:13.000 --> 29:18.520
strangulation of a friend who was like, like, like, like he was putting on his scarf, we

29:18.520 --> 29:24.920
were like bundling up for winter and I was like, I was probably like six or seven, like,

29:24.920 --> 29:31.000
and I was like, to my friend said, look, Carl is putting on his scarf, let's go up and

29:31.000 --> 29:37.480
let's just like, you take one end and I'll take the other and God, what? And you thought

29:37.480 --> 29:41.920
his head would get really small and go through the knot, like some kind of Jerry, I don't

29:41.920 --> 29:47.360
know, I swear, I don't know. I'd like, I, I know that I wasn't thinking let's murder

29:47.360 --> 29:52.920
a human being, I know that I wasn't thinking that I know I was thinking like, like, like

29:52.920 --> 29:58.280
violence is fun. Like, you know, I was thinking like, like, like he won't like it. He'll

29:58.280 --> 30:09.320
hate it. It'll be like a Mahoney on police academy screwing with the, you know, my Mauser,

30:09.320 --> 30:13.240
like, like, this will be a real laugh. Like he'll he'll he just certainly doesn't want

30:13.240 --> 30:19.200
his scarf much tighter than he's going to make it at his own. And, and, and, and my friend

30:19.200 --> 30:25.000
and I just would do is that it was my idea. I pitched it. He yes, they ended me. We grabbed

30:25.000 --> 30:34.800
one end of the other started pulling and Carl went like, what do you do? And a teacher came

30:34.800 --> 30:43.520
by and he was going on. He was fucking purple. And, and, and, and, and you guys are pulling

30:43.520 --> 30:50.680
as hard as you can. That's my memory. Yes. Like not understanding like anything about

30:50.680 --> 31:01.760
like, help me. Help me. And the teacher, the teacher, the teacher, the teacher was, we

31:01.760 --> 31:05.120
were young enough that the teacher was kind of omnipresent. Like no, there was no, it

31:05.120 --> 31:08.320
was like, it was like, we were, we could have been like first grade. I don't know how old

31:08.320 --> 31:14.320
you are in first grade. Like, what are you six? Yeah, because it's always, you're just

31:14.320 --> 31:18.280
out of kindergarten. And it's like, you're like, so the teacher's like a mother duck

31:18.280 --> 31:22.520
and like, all the ducks are kind of like, you know, she's trying to, so she was preoccupied

31:22.520 --> 31:29.880
for that sliver of time. And Jesus Christ did not leave kids alone. I shouldn't project

31:29.880 --> 31:34.400
don't leave me alone as a kid. Like I maybe I'm like, I have a fucking dover gene. So

31:34.400 --> 31:39.400
I'm just kind of thinking like putting myself in this situation, I would, I would, I'm hoping

31:39.400 --> 31:43.680
this is what I would do. This is what I would do is I would pull and go, Oh, what am I thinking

31:43.680 --> 31:49.000
and stop? But it sounds like you guys were like, kept going. Yeah. Well, we were trying

31:49.000 --> 31:54.240
to, she's like, here's what I remember happening. Like is that the is that I remember the teacher

31:54.240 --> 32:03.200
coming over and going like, and this is the strangest thing that I mean, it's, I'd have

32:03.200 --> 32:07.400
to like pull out like an overhead of the coat room or wherever we were the foyer is just

32:07.400 --> 32:10.960
like kids in winter coats everywhere, they're all bundling up and putting on moon boots

32:10.960 --> 32:15.320
and half of them are crying, half of them are allergic to cheese and you want to get

32:15.320 --> 32:20.720
that there's just mass hysteria, you know, and so within this mass hysteria, like three

32:20.720 --> 32:27.480
kids are doing this like weird thing. And so I just, I think what happened is the teacher

32:27.480 --> 32:33.600
somehow wasn't conscious of the crime that was taking place. She was only conscious of

32:33.600 --> 32:42.400
Carl dying. She I think that's just how long his scarf was that we were out of frame because

32:42.400 --> 32:47.120
it was Milwaukee and maybe his mother lovingly knit a very long doctor who scarf for him.

32:47.120 --> 32:52.400
And so we were just like out of the teacher's point of view. And so she was only just like

32:52.400 --> 32:58.720
her shock, the look on her face and the tone of her voice. And she's like, Carl. And that's

32:58.720 --> 33:05.760
what I, and I was like, Oh, and I let go. And she's like, Carl, like, like, and she like

33:05.760 --> 33:13.560
loosened the thing. And he's like, and couldn't speak. So he couldn't say these two people

33:13.560 --> 33:21.480
over here just tried to murder me. Take them to jail, call the police, like alter the course

33:21.480 --> 33:28.040
of his life. Did you did you just like, like, like, oh, man, what happened? Are you okay?

33:28.040 --> 33:32.680
We, we, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we stepped forward and said, Oh, I want me to introduce myself.

33:32.680 --> 33:40.520
I feel somewhat responsible for this. I see you're overwhelmed, Mrs. Burr. I should stay

33:40.520 --> 33:46.920
here. And no, we fucking backed up and walked earned and walked away and never spoke of it.

33:46.920 --> 33:51.800
Never spoke of it again. And I don't, I don't, Carl, I, I, I did improv with him in Milwaukee

33:51.800 --> 33:58.200
later, like when we were in high school. And I was like, do you remember me almost murdering

33:58.200 --> 34:02.840
you? I feel and he's like, No, man, I don't remember that. You want to get high?

34:02.840 --> 34:07.480
Well, you got you, you, you, and I'm like, what do you have, what do you have worked

34:07.480 --> 34:13.000
for NASA? He was like a really cool, funny guy, like high school brain long enough for him to

34:13.000 --> 34:17.960
forget. He was like, he ended up in comedy sports and he was like the funniest guy in his high

34:17.960 --> 34:22.920
school comedy sports team. And then like, like, and it was like really, really, like awesome dude

34:22.920 --> 34:27.480
that everybody liked. But he kind of had this personality that was like, Oh man, all right,

34:27.480 --> 34:31.480
he's kind of the Michael Richards of his school. And I always thought like, would you work for

34:31.480 --> 34:37.240
you give him a partial stroke? Yeah, like, like, like, did I, did I just nudge him into comedy? Like,

34:37.240 --> 34:42.520
you know, we're killing like a little bit of like math or something. I like, I'll have to wonder

34:42.520 --> 34:47.640
forever. But he forgave me the him that, that, that I, that I created forgave me.

34:50.200 --> 34:56.600
So who, who, so booblets was in the treehouse trying to come up your treehouse. And I want to

34:56.600 --> 35:00.440
say, and they're all these stories, there's other kids there. This isn't like a Tyler Jordan thing

35:00.440 --> 35:06.840
where I'm just murdering people. And I know their names sound made up, but these kids. So it was

35:06.840 --> 35:11.400
you, Dan Harmon. And who was on the other end? Well, I'm not going to nail it. It's gotten into

35:11.400 --> 35:16.760
the criminal. Well, make up the first name. What is the last name? Because it's Milwaukee. So it's

35:16.760 --> 35:22.440
some fucked up. Oh, what are you asking? You said booblets in Ramstack? No, no, no, no, I'm just

35:22.440 --> 35:27.080
saying who is holding the other end of the scarf. Yeah, I'm just the point of it is just like,

35:27.080 --> 35:32.520
because you said booblets and Ramstack and, and whatever. Stan, Stan, whose treehouse it was.

35:32.520 --> 35:36.120
Stan Frankie. Well, now I feel weird about naming everyone's names.

35:36.120 --> 35:40.680
Stan Frankie is responsible for the death of this child. God damn. It was my pitch.

35:40.680 --> 35:46.520
It was your pitch. Fine. I'm just saying, like, you've noticed this. We have, like in the Midwest,

35:46.520 --> 35:51.160
we have screwed up. My favorite name is one of Rob's friends was a girl that Rob went to school

35:51.160 --> 35:57.480
with. Her name was Missy Popinfoose. Oh, I was hottest girl in eighth grade. But we live in

35:57.480 --> 36:01.240
this area. I know I want to say because I like, yeah, I had this big crush on Linda Sheenbuckner

36:01.240 --> 36:05.240
in fourth grade. I like these names are great. But and you, and if you try to fake them, they're

36:05.240 --> 36:09.320
not great. But now we live on Facebook and then people like type these names in and then it's

36:09.320 --> 36:14.120
like, like, I don't know. I was really good friends with a guy named Brian Schrofnagel.

36:14.120 --> 36:22.760
And you don't, you don't think these names are weird until you meet Jeff and or come to Los

36:22.760 --> 36:30.280
Angeles. Did you guys have weird names? Anybody? Anybody? No. What's that? Tommy McGee. That's

36:30.280 --> 36:36.360
your name. Oh, okay. Tommy McGee. elementary school. Yeah. My teacher's one of my teachers

36:36.360 --> 36:42.200
swears he has a friend named Pat Moini. Pat Moini. I had a friend named Sean Malarkey.

36:42.200 --> 36:47.960
Oh, boy. How bad ass is that? I'm a larky. There was a guy that lived across the street

36:48.680 --> 36:57.480
from us. His name was Gordy Grepentrog. And he lived under a bridge. He was it was a name like

36:57.480 --> 37:04.200
that? You have to be a hockey player for the island. Gordon Grepentrog. But they call the

37:04.200 --> 37:09.320
bank of Christ to pass this bridge. Well, a lot of people don't know that you changed your name.

37:09.320 --> 37:13.960
You shortened your name for show business. Your show business. Your name is your name.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.080
And it didn't work.

37:21.560 --> 37:24.440
With all the good intentions, she turned it to Richard Pryor.

37:25.640 --> 37:29.640
Not for, not for pussy. And it didn't work.

37:30.840 --> 37:35.880
And it didn't work. Yeah, you shortened your, your, your full last name is Schrabdude.

37:35.880 --> 37:39.480
No, no. Whoa. All right. I thought that would get a bigger laugh. I guess.

37:39.480 --> 37:43.320
Big time. No, because it sounds possible after Schrafnagel and stuff like that.

37:43.320 --> 37:47.720
He refers to himself as the Schrabduke sometimes. Oh yeah, the Schrabduke. Yeah.

37:47.720 --> 37:54.440
All right. Well, anyways, names are stupid. Yeah. Like, was Tommy McFeely your crush when you

37:54.440 --> 38:01.640
were in grade school? But now he's Mr. McFeely. You had bigger fish to fry or you just weren't?

38:01.640 --> 38:08.440
You were what? Sorry. She had a lot going on. Oh, you had, okay.

38:09.880 --> 38:13.640
You were a girl, yeah, a girl in elementary school. So we were already practicing that

38:13.640 --> 38:18.840
society. Like, yeah, you had multiple suitors is what you're saying. Yeah. You got out of bed

38:18.840 --> 38:23.480
every day and we're like, well, how am I going to handle my situation without getting slut shamed?

38:23.480 --> 38:28.920
Is like, basically, like, like I gotta, I gotta, I gotta form a circular network where I don't piss

38:28.920 --> 38:34.520
anybody off and all this stuff. And Tommy McFeely's like, how am I going to bag whatever your name

38:34.520 --> 38:43.240
is, which we will, we will let have you leave you to your privacy. I had my first like in kindergarten,

38:43.240 --> 38:52.520
it was a Nicole McHugh and like, that's actually that sounds like a detective series. She was a,

38:52.520 --> 38:56.520
she was a, she was literally a little redhead girl, like, like Charlie Brown had his little

38:56.520 --> 39:01.080
redhead girl, which I don't think we ever saw, but Nicole McHugh was, so we would take attendance.

39:01.080 --> 39:06.200
She always wore pantyhomes. And then when, stop, you're talking about, talking about a kindergartener.

39:07.480 --> 39:11.320
There's just, I don't expect you to know how to weave these highway cones, but

39:13.080 --> 39:16.840
you got to keep it more wonder years than you.

39:16.840 --> 39:27.640
But I don't think I ever actually talked to her. I, I, I, what I remember is that during attendance,

39:28.680 --> 39:33.960
when my name was called, she would look at me and giggle. And when her name was called,

39:33.960 --> 39:38.600
I would look at her and giggle. And so, and I explained that to my mom. And then she said,

39:38.600 --> 39:43.720
oh, you got a girlfriend. And I was like, great, that's one last thing to worry about.

39:43.720 --> 39:49.640
I, I, I feel like my memory is that I just never fucked with it. Like, I, I just like,

39:49.640 --> 39:53.720
I'm not going to go talk to her now. I was just like, I got this, this is great. Like,

39:54.360 --> 39:58.040
every morning I get this, I get this, I get this partner was life partner.

39:59.400 --> 40:00.840
And she has no idea.

40:02.360 --> 40:09.080
No, she did. Well, she, she probably doesn't remember, but she, but she had an idea. We had,

40:09.080 --> 40:13.880
it was, it was a, we were soulmates. It was just bound to morning roll call.

40:15.080 --> 40:19.560
I think you're doing a little bit of rewriting history with a little booblets,

40:19.560 --> 40:24.520
maybe two by four. I think, I think you were giggling.

40:24.520 --> 40:28.760
I don't know why I'd make, you know, why would I revise that very self loathing?

40:28.760 --> 40:32.760
Like, like, like, why would I, because it's, it would be such an unusual thing. So it wasn't,

40:32.760 --> 40:38.280
like, it wasn't like I move, it would make sense that I made that up. If, if the rest of the story

40:38.280 --> 40:43.160
was that I like stalked her kindergarten style and like wouldn't leave her alone and stuff. And

40:43.160 --> 40:47.800
the reason why I did that is because I was getting green lights, you know, I wouldn't make up the

40:47.800 --> 40:54.760
green lights. But, but I, and I, the way I remember it is that it was the, it was the perfect

40:54.760 --> 41:03.480
relationship. I never talked to her. And, and there were, yeah. And I do, I was, I was aware of

41:03.480 --> 41:08.920
the fact that there were lots and lots of girls that, that had no desire to giggle and smile.

41:08.920 --> 41:13.880
Hey, it's okay. It's all right. It's fine. It's not your fault. Yeah. You're happy.

41:13.880 --> 41:17.160
It's not your fault. You're happy now. It's not your fault. You're happy now, man.

41:17.960 --> 41:21.320
It's not your fault. Look how these people came out to see you. You guys are jerks.

41:24.840 --> 41:28.360
Everybody's just so tired. You guys have been here all day long. How many beers have you

41:28.360 --> 41:35.480
had been consumed here? Was there a bar here? One per person. You only got the one beer?

41:37.080 --> 41:43.800
What do you mean we gave you? Okay. I wouldn't give you anybody. There's more. There's more

41:43.800 --> 41:51.720
where people. There's more beer. There's more beer, people. Let's go to the concession. Let's all get

41:51.720 --> 42:01.080
it. We could. Everybody reach under your seat. Should we all just take a nap? We should watch

42:01.080 --> 42:06.360
the stars. And there's this giant bottle of Kettle One taunting you from on stage.

42:07.560 --> 42:13.800
Maybe we should, we'll take a journey through space and I'll do that by slowing the tempo

42:13.800 --> 42:24.520
down on this chord bot song. Can we get sexy lights up there? Perfect. Oh, there we go.

42:29.400 --> 42:32.600
We made it. I'm gonna actually change some instrumentation here to make this a little

42:32.600 --> 42:46.920
better. We need less picked guitar, maybe a little more synth. The universe

42:46.920 --> 43:01.800
opens its arms to you and you to it. So feel the universe inside of you.

43:04.600 --> 43:12.280
The Beetlejuice Nebula folding outward into the horse head spandex

43:12.280 --> 43:22.920
in the constellation Agamemnon orbiting Uranus and the Ork Belt,

43:25.480 --> 43:35.160
which I hear just had to add a new hole. Getting a little thin Milky Way. The universe is expanding.

43:35.160 --> 43:44.600
The carbohydrate complex. We are exiting now what you know as the solar system.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.680
Try to imagine. Excuse me. I'm sorry. What? Yes.

43:53.560 --> 43:54.840
The stars are moving.

43:59.800 --> 44:02.040
Yeah, kill the, uh, can we kill the lights that are,

44:02.040 --> 44:05.960
oh, those are probably just workplaces that are plugged into a generator. Yeah,

44:05.960 --> 44:09.560
this is for our subscribers probably too, so they can see. Well, who cares? The subscribers

44:09.560 --> 44:14.360
will not see stars if they turn the lights off. That's true. I think if they haven't been

44:15.000 --> 44:19.400
turned off by now, it means it's not gonna switch. You mean the subscribers? Yes.

44:22.440 --> 44:29.240
Try to relax. Understand that your mind is made of the same carbon as the stars around you.

44:29.240 --> 44:35.720
Stars around you. You no longer crave heavy creams and sauces.

44:37.800 --> 44:38.440
Saucy.

44:39.720 --> 44:48.040
Saucy. Cigarettes have no control over you. No control, no control, no control. Do you,

44:48.040 --> 44:52.760
do you have one? I see another voice in the cosmos. It looks a little eager to get in here.

44:52.760 --> 44:59.560
You must kill Dave Booblets. Booblets. All right, well, I don't think that's,

44:59.560 --> 45:05.000
because I mean really, fuck that guy. I don't think. Get out of my treehouse,

45:05.000 --> 45:11.800
you uptown piece of shit. We're leaving those aggressions behind. You are no longer a primate,

45:11.800 --> 45:21.560
you are a Kubrickian space baby. No more gazelle femurs. Why do I live inside of a big old rectangle

45:21.560 --> 45:29.800
thing? That's not a planet. Saturn's up there, like a big old asshole.

45:33.080 --> 45:41.160
The monolith represents the golden ratio and the concept of geometry, a human construct.

45:41.160 --> 45:47.560
Do you know why God likes Saturn the most, Dan? Because if you like it, you gotta put a ring on it.

45:47.560 --> 45:58.200
Moving past Saturn now, out into the outer zeochron orbit, the home of Neptune.

45:58.200 --> 46:03.240
Oh, there's Uranus. Thank you. Yeah, I can see some, some Klingons on it.

46:04.200 --> 46:09.640
Do you know how Klingons get on Uranus? The captain's log.

46:09.640 --> 46:17.320
Wow. It's an easy crowd.

46:19.720 --> 46:23.640
They cling on. Okay, fuck you people.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.880
I'm sorry about that. I snapped.

46:31.400 --> 46:34.120
Uranus just decided to fuck straight off into outer space.

46:34.120 --> 46:44.040
Because we are departing the birthplace of our primate bodies and rejoining our larger progenitor.

46:44.040 --> 46:50.680
I can see my house from here. Although we are moving away from the focal point you once knew

46:50.680 --> 46:57.480
as the origin, we are actually moving toward the origin of all the created you as we move

46:57.480 --> 47:04.360
further toward the center of the cluster of star systems known colloquially as the Milky Way.

47:05.640 --> 47:13.880
The center of the Milky Way is a hot, blustering epicenter of chemical reaction.

47:15.560 --> 47:18.760
Probably a big black hole wishes it could suck every...

47:19.480 --> 47:22.360
Excuse me. What? Are you gonna be done in there? Hold on a second.

47:22.360 --> 47:28.520
What? Are you almost done? Are you almost done in there? I'm... I have to take a shit.

47:29.720 --> 47:37.560
There's more than one bathroom. This is the only man's bathroom. Excuse me. I don't see the world through that lens.

47:39.240 --> 47:43.080
Just hurry up. There's people waiting on here. I'm dancing on one leg. Okay. Damn it.

47:43.800 --> 47:46.760
Okay. You're leaving the... Just a little faster.

47:46.760 --> 47:53.080
There's a urinal right here. Can I just go while you're sitting? Yes. Yes. I didn't even...

47:53.640 --> 48:01.960
Yeah. Okay. Do your thing. All right. Don't look. I'm trying. Let your mind re-evaporate and expand.

48:01.960 --> 48:09.800
What? What? I'm not talking to you. Are you talking to me? Here's the room for one more in here.

48:09.800 --> 48:17.320
Here. Just a second. Oh, geez. Just a second. Woo. Open a window. Just a second. Okay.

48:17.320 --> 48:23.480
Open a window to your consciousness. How do you like that? It's like somebody laid a gas giant in here.

48:26.280 --> 48:29.640
What do you think of that? What do you think of that? What do you think of when I'm back in there?

48:29.640 --> 48:42.840
Slowly, you're drifting back towards your point of origin as you feel your corporeal sentience,

48:42.840 --> 48:51.800
coalesce, returning now to your original home. However, your journey has redefined you.

48:51.800 --> 48:53.880
You like it? Your perspective. You like that?

48:53.880 --> 49:03.080
When you're at the bank, getting mad, you'll now remember I am but a speck on a piece of salt.

49:06.840 --> 49:13.480
Dan, look, it's the moon. The moon's out tonight. Soon we will colonize the moon

49:13.480 --> 49:24.040
five hours before Donald Trump's space force gets there and makes a McDonald's.

49:25.400 --> 49:27.000
Don't forget to wash your hands.

49:31.560 --> 49:38.200
Earth is unique, you realize now. Having experienced the inky void, you see it for what it is.

49:38.200 --> 49:45.400
A unique gem. A science fiction of its own. Are you fucking kidding me?

49:46.600 --> 49:48.280
You already used paper towels.

49:48.280 --> 50:07.960
So you're using the… It never works. Never works. Hey, you know, I can help it overhearing.

50:08.760 --> 50:13.560
You're doing a really good job. You're doing a really good job at talking on the toilet there.

50:13.560 --> 50:15.800
That's really good. Do you even know what I'm doing?

50:15.800 --> 50:19.560
No, but I'm liking it a lot. Here, let me give you my card.

50:21.560 --> 50:30.200
Any time you want to come over to Pedro's Pizza, you just show him that card. You get

50:30.200 --> 50:37.880
like a free chair. All right, well, I better be going. I can't hang around here all day.

50:37.880 --> 50:45.320
I'm not stopping you. Okay. See you later, Pedro. Better leave now.

50:46.760 --> 50:53.080
Yeah, yeah, gotta go out into the big wide world and make my day here.

50:57.960 --> 51:05.320
See ya. I really thought something was gonna come with that, but what are you talking about?

51:05.320 --> 51:07.400
Nothing. Are you hitting on me?

51:10.680 --> 51:14.520
No, I'm not. Don't worry about it. It's fine. I'll take the card back. If you're not gonna use it.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.680
Thank you. All right. You're not that good at it.

51:20.680 --> 51:36.120
Slowly, you approach Earth's adamantine glass ceiling that keeps those of us that are targeted

51:37.640 --> 51:48.600
confined to the Earth, or those that hover above it, orbit in predatory, self-satisfied

51:48.600 --> 51:55.400
narcissism looking down at us like manic depressive eagles.

52:00.200 --> 52:03.560
But you have a better perspective. You're on your meds.

52:07.320 --> 52:10.760
And as your therapist told you, you're getting your thoughts in order.

52:10.760 --> 52:17.320
And your roommate is a bitch, so you're doing it in a bathroom at a hotel.

52:18.840 --> 52:25.000
And that means you're gonna deal with other people. That's fine. You're patient. You're a cosmic.

52:25.720 --> 52:32.200
You embody the universe. Your name is Michael. But your pronoun is they.

52:32.200 --> 52:37.640
They. For you are humanity.

52:37.640 --> 52:57.160
All right. I better wipe.

52:57.160 --> 53:07.880
These are the credits rolling as he's, as he's wiping. It's just a big wide show.

53:10.920 --> 53:14.840
Wiping is more, more tempo.

53:14.840 --> 53:25.240
Why don't we go down. There's nothing there.

53:28.280 --> 53:29.560
I miss my mother.

53:33.080 --> 53:35.960
Go to E minor says the fucking guy.

53:35.960 --> 53:44.120
Oh, yeah. He was fucking right, though.

53:46.520 --> 53:49.640
Now you can really get up in there wiping. Yeah.

53:50.760 --> 53:57.480
Go down. Yeah, tear the edges off. He minors the wiping court.

53:58.680 --> 54:01.560
It goes like this from front to back.

54:01.560 --> 54:07.560
That was a crazy app. Dan was kind of crazy that you weren't even looking behind you,

54:07.560 --> 54:10.600
but you were actually kind of right on where we were in space.

54:10.600 --> 54:16.120
Well, that may be due to maybe Rob. Are you in charge of the planets? No, just the sound. Okay.

54:18.040 --> 54:21.320
So it was God and me working together. Is this God?

54:21.880 --> 54:22.760
Is this God?

54:25.960 --> 54:29.320
Is this God? Do you want to, do you want to play that clip?

54:29.320 --> 54:34.520
I see. Has anybody ever seen the movie zapped with Scott Mayo? Scott Mayo, Willie Ames?

54:34.520 --> 54:40.520
Yeah. There's a remake? Yeah, there is. I typed zapped into YouTube and there's a

54:41.480 --> 54:46.520
modern zapped, but there's also, if you dig deep enough, there's a 1980 zapped with an actor named

54:46.520 --> 54:53.560
Scott Bayo who? Willie Ames. He's been famous lately for not acting.

54:53.560 --> 54:57.800
It's kind of a teen, a teen tit movie fantasy where a guy has telekinetic powers,

54:57.800 --> 55:00.920
and he of course uses them to make girls' shirts fly off and stuff like that.

55:01.480 --> 55:05.560
But there's a scene where he gets BA'd by these two frat boy, like jocks,

55:06.360 --> 55:09.240
and they take their pants down and they're mocking him in the back of a convertible.

55:09.240 --> 55:14.120
Hey, you weasel, thanks for losing the tournament for us. Now get a load of this.

55:16.120 --> 55:20.200
And then they flash his ass and then Scott Bayo uses. He's playing the clip.

55:20.200 --> 55:28.600
They pull their asses out. They say, kiss this. And then Scott Bayo looks at the two girls

55:29.160 --> 55:32.200
with anger and then telekinetically makes their boobs pop out.

55:32.200 --> 55:48.680
Hashtag rape culture. And then he, he levitates. So listen to this.

55:55.640 --> 55:58.680
They're hovering upside down with their asses hanging out.

55:58.680 --> 56:03.960
And they put him up a tree and they're like, oh, shit. And one guy goes, oh, is this God?

56:04.760 --> 56:08.680
And they keep saying it. It's like the, it's like the same clip, you know, like they,

56:08.680 --> 56:12.440
they said, is this God? At some point, they just keep the editor using it.

56:12.440 --> 56:19.320
Is this God? Is this God? And the only thing that makes the boobs, it's like the boobs,

56:19.320 --> 56:22.520
you're like, ah, geez, this isn't holding up to cultural shifts, but,

56:22.520 --> 56:29.560
but, but, but it kind of balances out because there's so much footage of these two men's asses.

56:31.240 --> 56:36.760
They're just like wiggling and jiggling. The film is sped up and they're just like,

56:36.760 --> 56:43.960
ah, is this God? Is this God? It's a hot thing to say.

56:43.960 --> 56:47.800
I like, yeah, if you're, if you're being levitated with your friend and you're being

56:47.800 --> 56:52.760
put in a tree with your pants down, that you instantly go to a metaphysical place.

56:52.760 --> 56:57.640
It's, it's also a weird thing to subject like, I'm sure the 12 year old kids that are watching

56:57.640 --> 57:03.240
this movie when their parents are out of the room to see their first pair of naked Harry

57:03.240 --> 57:08.920
men's assholes. And just hearing the phrase, is this God over and over again? Well, they're,

57:08.920 --> 57:16.120
well each like a muscular rump is twitching over the trunk of a tree. Like, I'm sure some

57:16.120 --> 57:21.160
awakenings happen on both sides of this movie, which is why it's kind of like, it's like,

57:21.160 --> 57:27.240
sure there's a lot of, you know, yeah, I don't know. It's a very, it's a very strange film.

57:27.240 --> 57:31.480
Yes. But the 80s were a strange time. Five years ago was a strange time. The rules,

57:32.440 --> 57:37.560
they're changing fast. Changing fast. So, so much change. Yeah, you can't even put a bomb on a

57:37.560 --> 57:43.560
girl's door anymore. It's crazy. We're looking at, we're looking at behaviors that were once

57:43.560 --> 57:49.560
allowable, completely acceptable and normal. And we're, we're, we're thinking about them now.

57:49.560 --> 57:53.800
Doesn't even really matter what, what it's the awareness is the important thing. Isn't that

57:53.800 --> 57:59.240
right, chef? I believe so. I think you have a song about that, don't you? I do. Wow.

58:01.080 --> 58:06.680
Pardon? He said a women's song. Sorry, my $1,000 phone doesn't recognize my thumb print or me

58:06.680 --> 58:12.680
with my glasses on. It's $1,000. I can't really sing right now because my voice jam, my voice is

58:12.680 --> 58:16.680
a little shattered. That's all right. My phone can't turn on because I'm wearing glasses.

58:19.320 --> 58:23.160
I use the password. Wait, you have retinal scam in your phone?

58:23.160 --> 58:28.040
Yeah, it's a face scam. It's scanning your face. And so if you're, I don't know, in rare

58:28.040 --> 58:35.480
circumstances like maybe you're wearing glasses or outside. Or maybe you just have a beard.

58:35.480 --> 58:38.760
Maybe you've grown your, maybe your beard has changed. No, maybe you just had one to begin with

58:38.760 --> 58:44.440
and it hasn't changed at all. I can't believe I fell for this fucking iPhone X.

58:45.320 --> 58:50.840
I'll buy anything. I've told you that on my podcast, if you at an airport make a chalk

58:50.840 --> 58:55.480
outline with a pile of human shit in it, and you just, and you just say poor people aren't

58:55.480 --> 59:01.640
allowed to have this. I'll like pay $10,000 to like eat the shit. Like I'll just stand inside

59:01.640 --> 59:08.680
the circle and be like, I'm, I'm important. I get to be in this circle. Who the fuck was that guy?

59:12.360 --> 59:16.440
Don't trust that ice. We don't know who that fucking was. That was Steve Levy, everybody.

59:20.920 --> 59:25.560
Love it or leave it. My eyes keep going to this guy's face. You're having a terrible time.

59:25.560 --> 59:29.000
You're, you're, you're here as a captive, right? I mean, you didn't certainly,

59:29.000 --> 59:33.320
you're worst mate. It's not talking to you, Deadpool. Give me a break. You're in heaven.

59:33.320 --> 59:36.920
You talking to the guy the Yankees had here? What's your name? Yeah, it's Deadpool's uncle.

59:37.960 --> 59:42.920
What's your, what's your name, sir? Anthony. Anthony, are you here because you like

59:42.920 --> 59:47.400
Comic Con kind of things or like? We promise we will not make fun of you if you tell us the

59:47.400 --> 59:51.080
objective actual story of how you got here because I can tell it is not by being a fan of mine.

59:52.840 --> 59:56.600
And so I just want to know the step-by-step story of how you ended up at this show.

59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.360
Are you, are you with Deadpool here? Is he, is he a relation of yours?

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:08.760
So just so everybody knows, his face is, that's not, there's a little, no, it's, it's, it's, it's,

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:15.160
it's this. He's, he's a good sport and it's not his fault. Also, there's like, I think it's like,

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:19.400
there's a light hitting your face. Yeah, you're like one of the only people who's lit. You're,

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:23.480
you're like, you're like, are you in the theater because you're really finding your light right

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:29.480
now? Your, your name, sir? Anthony. Anthony just told us. And does your son?

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:36.120
Anthony Jr. So Anthony and Anthony. Anthony is third. So you're Anthony Jr.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:45.800
And Anthony, you, you dragged your father here? Is he, is he enjoying himself? Clearly.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.800
Anthony Jr. That's like data. You can't read his face.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:55.720
That's how I am. See what? 71. 71 years old. Fantastic.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.280
And you're proud of your son. You're, you're proud.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.480
Now I'm 45. How does it feel to get to an age that gets applause?

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:15.320
Anthony Jr. That's gotta be a little weird threshold. I was recently, I just, I just crossed

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:21.560
a threshold where a waitress came to me. I was sitting by myself and I ordered a beer and she,

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:33.320
she said, she said, can I see some ID? And I'm like, oh, yeah. She's like, no discriminating,

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.520
right? And she was just like, she's like 25. She's just having the time of her life. She's just

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:44.600
like, that would be hilarious if I carted Ian McKellen. Like I just realized she walked away

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:51.720
and I was like, wow, I've, yeah, I mean, I, I don't really, I don't mind dying. I, I, I, I,

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:58.920
I don't want to be 25 again. I remember it was very, very difficult. And I'm, I'm, I'm okay,

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:05.080
but it's, it is just odd to monitor these milestones. You said your age and then everyone

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:12.760
applauded, but the subtext was you made it. Your father's 96. Wow. Oh, your dad's still alive. He's

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:21.320
96. No applause for that shit. At 71, I'd be applauding that because he's like a genetic,

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:27.640
like he's carving the way for you. I, I, I, I, my, my, my, my patriarchs kind of, we don't know

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.000
how biologically what their expiration date is. They tend to, they tend to take themselves out with

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.920
cigarettes, with, with cigarettes and things, not, not with, not, not Hemingway style. I just mean

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.920
they, they, they, they don't, they, they use the world around them. They don't, they don't, they

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:49.320
don't just like sit there and like try to avoid dying. They kind of like, oh, that looks good.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:56.360
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What? What? Oh, okay. Go ahead, Dan. We brought him into the show. I know,

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.880
I know, I know, I know. Sorry about your son. Dan doesn't have a son and neither does Rob and

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:09.960
neither does Jeff and neither do I. You guys are obviously pretty close then. Yeah. Yeah. That's

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:16.440
cool. You, you and your son can go out. Well, Anthony Jr., how old are you? I'm in the 30s.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:22.120
Okay. He's very trepidatious. I'm sorry. I didn't, he's wearing a Deadpool mask. He's wearing a mask.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:31.240
I'm over 20. It's perfectly fine here. You're fine here. I think no one's like,

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:36.920
he's in his 30s and he's dressed as Deadpool at a convention. This is where we come to escape

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:46.360
that kind of pressure. Yeah. Well, I mean, she, she, she affected me. He said the bartender would

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.680
have torn down his tank. It didn't affect me. I remembered it. You know, like, we're all, yeah,

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:56.120
we all, we all get, we all get, we all get hit. All of our buttons get mashed at different times.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:02.120
I think the, I think the objective is the, is the, the, the, the, uh, uh, you get this big keyboard

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:07.160
of buttons and like, I think, I think you want them all lit up before you die. And like the ones

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.360
that aren't lit up yet, the first time they get pushed, they, it's like Jesus Christ, they go from

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:18.200
not lit up to lit up and it's a monumental event. And sometimes that's traumatic. It almost always

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.360
is traumatic. How many of them are just eating your first chocolate bar? There's like five of those.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:28.760
The rest of them are trauma based. And then you're like, Oh God, that happened. But then, then, then

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.840
people can just put beers down on those buttons. They're already lit up. They don't toggle. They

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:40.040
don't go off. It's called scarring. Uh, and, and, and I think, I think the objective is to like try

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.920
to like, you know, get, and I think to extend the metaphor, I don't think you're able to like

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:50.200
really push most of them. I think most of those buttons are only accessible because other people

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.600
have to push them. They have to do with other people. Didn't you carry around like a towel

01:04:54.600 --> 01:05:00.920
like Arthur Dent for a long time? Yes. When you were, when you were younger? Yes, I did. Yes,

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:06.840
I was very into Hitchhiker's Guide and when I was a middle school, yeah, dead pill, little, little,

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:11.320
little late to be so into something that you actually have a towel that you carry around.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:18.200
But I went to a public high junior high and there, there wasn't a lot to distract me from,

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:28.280
yeah. I didn't dress like Doctor Who. I dressed as like my version of Doctor Who.

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:38.280
Uh-huh. Like I had a, a, a USA cap and I would wear four scarves, cut off jeans, two different

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:43.800
pairs of shoes. Four scarves? Yeah. What do you mean two different pairs of shoes? You mean one,

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.400
you mean, you mean a mismatched pair of shoes? A mismatched. Like Punky Brewster. Yeah, I would put

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:52.760
them on my hands and feet. Yeah, I don't know. I thought, I thought maybe they were a side-by-side.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:58.440
I know Hawaiian shirt and I. Like a T-Rex, T-Rex cop with a Whippy Goldberg thing. Yeah, and uh,

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:05.000
and I would walk, I would walk out of the, I would go to, I would walk home from school and my mom

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:12.760
would meet me with this look. Why are you so well lit? Are you the devil? I don't know. He's got this

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:16.840
awesome. He's got a, he's holding a bounce forward or something. He looks like, he's about to, like

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:22.040
he's the, he's the third act like of a horror movie that's about to happen. He's like Highlander.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.760
He's like the beginning of Highlander when they push in during the wrestling game. Like,

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:32.920
like the wrestling game. That wrestling game. Who here, oh, let's continue this streak. It's,

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:38.920
it's a very, it's a very nice energy. It's an intimate energy. Who here wants to share their,

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:45.480
like actually come up here, take the mic and share their story of like when they crossed the

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:53.560
threshold into alienation, isolation, nerd culture, when there was no longer any hope for, of, of

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:58.680
assimilation. We've, we've got lots of. Let's make it a gal because we have enough dudes up here.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:08.680
Anybody? You miss right there. What's your name? Isabelle. Let's welcome Isabelle down to the stage.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:14.600
She's gonna make it down without destroying the place like Rob when he came down. It was gonna

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:19.560
be great if it would have went off like rehearsal. Did you want to fall down the stairs? No, nobody

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:31.960
wants to fall down. Well, you do stuff like that. Isabelle, everybody. Well, when I became into this

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:37.720
culture, my dad actually brought me into this culture. Uh-oh. He took you to a planetarium

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:43.800
show and let you dress as Deadpool. It was all downhill from there. But that means he can take

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:52.120
you out of this culture. I brought you into this culture that I can take you out of. My dad started

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:59.880
introducing me to Buffy, everything I know. Oh, even Doctor Who. Oh, I go to. It's a good show.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:04.760
It's a good show, right? Which, who's your favorite doctor? My favorite doctor is Matt Smith, who I

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:13.320
actually met. Very good. Very good. Very good. Good doctor. Pretty much. I met everyone I know, uh-oh,

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:23.480
from cons every now and then. Are you old school? Old school. Oh, I've been to icon. That's an old

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:30.200
school con. No, I meant like old school Doctor Who. Yeah, I watched old school Doctor Who a couple

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:38.440
of times. What do you mean by icon? Icon is a convention. Oh, okay. For optometrist. It used to

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:46.680
be held all the way out in, uh, I believe it. Stony Brook. Stony Brook? Yeah. I haven't been there

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:54.200
since I was six, so. But you felt welcomed when you were in that world, right? Your dad started

01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:01.160
taking you to kind of conventions like this. That was like, like, he was a Buffy fan? Yeah, he was

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:09.560
Buffy. He was, I'm trying to think, Star Wars, Star Trek. I'm trying to think of other stuff. So he's

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:19.000
our age. Yeah. We're supposed to have Isabelle's by now. If we were adults, if we lived anywhere

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.760
but Los Angeles, we would have lovely, uh, human beings that are joining the world as we fade.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:32.200
Instead we're, instead we're buying Teslas to try to hide our bold spot. You actually met my dad.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:37.640
I met your dad. Yeah, he was the photographer. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, he was saying how excited you

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:43.480
were. I got the impression that you weren't able to be here, because he was like, my daughter would

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:49.160
be thrilled or whatever. Like he was taking pictures in there, if they're doing signing. Yeah. Oh. He was

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:54.440
the main guy taking pictures. That's great. Yeah, I mean, I, so, so, so you remember that feeling

01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:00.040
of like, like going to a convention and all of a sudden like, it was like, like, oh, like, like,

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.120
oh, is it, do you think it was more like the absence of the kinds of things you felt walking in the

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:10.520
halls of your school where you were like, there's just like, it's like this chiropractic ergonomic

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:16.760
like pressure. You're like, I can't do nothing right around here. Like I, if I answer a question,

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:20.920
even though I know the answer, I know I'm going to do it wrong. I'm going to get laughed at somehow,

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:26.280
or they just like everything is like, geez, you feel like, you feel like it's a, like the world is

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:33.480
covered in, in half full glasses at this table and every gesture you make knocks three of them over

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:38.360
and you desperately don't want to. So then you start gesturing differently. And then that's funny.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:43.320
And then you, and then you go to, for me, it was Gen Con in Milwaukee, like,

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:50.200
which was the, just, there was this role playing and base D&D and stuff, but it was, it was just like,

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:58.920
oh God, to see grown men and women wearing ridiculous armor and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:06.360
and, like, the, actually, my mom, my mom, my mom took me to stuff before that. I think my mom knew,

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:11.320
she's like, she's like, this kid collects stickers. He's like, he's not going to be a football star.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:17.640
And where is your, how, what's the state of your parents' marriage, like, historically?

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:24.280
I'm not trying to pick up her mom. They're, they've been together the whole time.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:30.520
Yeah, they've been together. They got married right before I was born. So that's how it's

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:37.480
usually supposed to work, but they had my, my brother was first, as my mom met my dad. So.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.800
Okay. How is your, what's your mom's relationship with the nerd stuff?

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:46.920
She goes to it every now and then just hold the stand.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.960
Is that a, is that a reference to the chupa from a Jewish wedding? She says, she's doing her part.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:12:00.600
Hold the stand. No, she holds the stand for photography.

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:06.440
She literally holds the light stand. I thought it was like, I heard, like,

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:12.440
I heard hold the standard, like, like it's a battle, like, if this man shall fall, who will pick up the standard?

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:21.480
But is your mom kind of like, you know, like, can you let me know whenever I'm prying or whatever

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:25.880
I'm going to like exploit a horrible, deep-seated, like, personality conflicts within your family

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:33.400
unit and cause a breakup? But is your, is your dad's a nerd? Let's just put it that way. Is your mom, like,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:44.680
not a nerd? Is she like, she's, I think she's like, she watches murder mystery shows. She's that type of nerd.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:49.720
There's a good crossover there, like, true crime stuff. I find like, I, yeah, like, my girlfriend's

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:57.160
not into sci-fi and fantasy necessarily. She's into what, you know, me being happy. But like,

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.760
at the same time, like, she's not going to, by default, want to watch a shitty, like,

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:08.920
Gil Gerard is an astronaut in prison. Like, I, but we both, and I don't want, I don't like rom-coms,

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:16.280
but like, we both like, real life murder. Because it's sort of like, as extreme as normal life gets.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:22.440
And I think, I think that's why I like sci-fi is because it, it, it, it heightens everything. It

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.640
stains human relationships with iodine. So it, because every story on Star Trek is like, well,

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:34.600
what, who, what is good and what is evil? It's like a, it's too nuanced in 27 dresses. So, so,

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.320
like, I don't, I'm not going to taste every nook and cranny of what Kate Hudson's going through. But

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:45.480
like, I like, I like a guy to go like, there's an octopus monster on the poop deck of the Starfleet.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:51.240
And he only tastes fear. And he says, you have a choice between killing someone you love and

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:55.560
powering your rocket boots. And, and, and, okay, now I'm starting to, now I can break this down

01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:04.120
into rules and cope. Do you, do you, do you, what's what grade are you in? I'm going into 12 right

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:09.160
now. Oh, wow. So you're almost out. Yeah, I'm finally almost out. What are you going to do?

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:14.520
What are you interested in? Or do you hate that question? I'm thinking of going for US history.

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:21.000
Oh, wow. That you're going to be like a keeper. Like, like, you're going to be the only person

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:30.600
that knows we did this before. Is there a certain period, is there a certain era or time or place

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:37.480
that you're most fascinated with? I'm pretty much fascinated with all of US history. I find myself

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:46.920
thinking about the 1930s a lot lately. I don't know why. I just find. Not necessarily a fan,

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:52.920
but just it keeps. Yeah, I don't know. I keep running it over in my head. I really learned so

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:58.280
much. Your, your, your dad's a photographer and your mother is, does she do anything creative as

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:05.080
well? She does dialysis. That's only what she does. Like she needs dialysis or she provides

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:10.680
dialysis. Photos too. She, they're both photographers. She's a freelance dialysis technician. She's not

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:15.160
licensed, but she has a Nevada you don't have to be. She has a food truck outside.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:21.080
No, your mom, your mom actually, that's like her specialty is she, she

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:27.880
administrates dialysis. Like she puts the needle in and watches the. Yeah. Yeah. Damn.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:34.840
Yeah. I remember seeing some like, who was there? Like, uh, do you watch that John Oliver show at

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:43.320
HBO? They did a second dialysis, like, and how it's like, as an industry, like dialysis for,

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:48.600
for money and how it's like, like big dialysis, like, like, like, like people like. I think my mom

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:55.000
might have. Yeah. She, like, I want, I, I can't remember anything about it except it freaks me

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.800
out. The idea that there's a whole industry where we get our blood changed to like Jiffy Lube. Well,

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:04.280
they're probably like stocking your good blood and giving you back like used blood, right?

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:12.600
So do you want to be a teacher? Sprite blood, but just sprite blood. I wish if we could be so

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.960
lucky to have sprite blood. Aren't you a little bit, uh. Sprite suck. Sprite's good. I don't want

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:22.120
to make assumptions, but if you're a nerd and like, I went through this stuff and you weren't like,

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:27.320
oh, no, I feel like the bell of the ball in the high school. Like, like, all right. If, if, assuming

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:32.760
a couple things here, like, you know, like 85% or so of your student body here, like,

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:38.520
aren't you, aren't you a little, when you think about being a teacher, don't you,

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:44.920
do you, don't you get scared? Like, like, listen, then I have to like, be the most hated person

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:50.840
to these like morons that, but you know, do you feel empathy for them and you want them to be

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:59.560
smarter and know the history and don't repeat it. Yeah. The bad part of history. You can repeat the

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:14.760
good part. If you guys want to do another gold rush, go ahead. There's gold. Go find gold, baby.

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:22.440
Do you, do you, do you, I don't want to put you on the spot, but could you teach us some history?

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:33.240
I just finished a whole US history regions. Okay. Just give it, give us a taste. Could you give us

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.560
a taste? Dan, put, play your space music and she can lay some history on us. Okay. If this is

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:43.240
embarrassing, just, just give me this and I'll stop. But if you want to also, you could tell me if

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:49.560
you don't feel comfortable telling that to Schrab. Because I'm on your side and not trying to harm

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:54.760
you. Just don't talk to SOTY human resources. They're just trying to protect their own legal

01:17:54.760 --> 01:18:06.520
department, whatever you do. So it's like, because kids scubs, oh man, oh man, did you see that show

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:12.760
last night? Oh man, I'll YouTube you later. Hashtag motherfucker. And then, and then I'll sit down.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:21.400
Okay. And then, and then you walk in. And again, if you don't want to just tell me, and I will

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:26.120
make this stop because I don't want you to feel bad. I really don't really want anything because I

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:31.800
just went like through that whole test. Yeah. That's great because you probably nailed it. Yeah.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:42.120
Sorry. Sorry. We're trying to do a show. What was the topic? I'll teach history and we'll see if

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:48.760
you can stand letting me do it. Pretend like you're you're you're here to dance the teacher and you're

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:53.720
like going to grade him. Right. On how you're like a teacher, teacher. And I'm trying to pass an

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.600
exam so I can become a teacher. And they're the students that are like that. You just you just

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:03.960
won like a lot of a ton of money. And now you're going to leave. And you want to make sure that

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:09.080
your legacy goes on. You know, you're like, this is the week you give me a historical area.

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:13.400
Yeah. How about the 1930s? Okay, you brought that up.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:21.560
Talk about the Great Depression. Right. Okay. Great Depression. What was so great about it? I

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:25.320
mean, it seemed like everybody was pissed off. I mean, come on. You can use that.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:37.560
Yeah. The 1930s saw the planet coping with a global economic crisis.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:43.880
Still the aftermath of the Versailles Treaty from World War One. I got that right.

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.920
The biggest bearer of the biggest brunt being the

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:55.640
Causers of World War One. But let's not throw anyone under the bus. Germany.

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:04.120
In the streets of Berlin, you could take a stack of German money. And it was more valuable as a

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:09.880
doorstop than it was legal tender. Rocks were worth more money than money.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:15.800
And the world didn't care. You couldn't cry out from from from Germany. We got it pretty

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:20.440
bad over here. We're really broke. Like no one's going to go boo-hoo for the people that

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:26.760
had worse spiked helmets look like Darth Vader minus the skull and invented mustard gas or

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:34.040
caused us to invent it. I don't know. World War One was really bad. World War One was so bad that

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:41.240
it defines everything up to and including World War Two. The 1930s, the bridge between those times

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:47.400
saw the entire planet going into a right wing slide. People were starting to get into this thing

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:55.800
called nationalism. Why is my country anyone else's business? Why isn't it me versus the other

01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:02.200
countries? How do I know other countries have my best interest at heart? Maybe I should stockpile

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:09.560
weaponry. Maybe I should put a tighter cinch on immigration. Maybe I should industrialize,

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:15.000
institutionalize, even nationalize some of our chief institutions. Maybe there's people in this

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.680
country already that I don't really like the way they got here in the first place. So why are they

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:28.280
in control of the garment district? Why are they all why do why do they get to bank? Why do they get

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:35.000
to gem? Why do they get to get their fingers in these pies? And in every country throughout the

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:42.520
world, scapegoating starts to get... It gets funny. It gets funny. So you have scapegoating,

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.640
you have the ceiling of the borders, you have the stockpiling of arms, and you start to embrace

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:54.280
hierarchy. There's an authoritarian instinct inside of all of us. When times get tough and

01:21:54.280 --> 01:22:02.600
confusing, the easiest thing to do is to be told what to do. You want simplicity. You don't want

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:09.800
complexity when your family is hungry and when issues are being brought to your face every day.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:13.960
You're getting a fire hose of information. Hey, did you hear down the street? This person thinks

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:20.600
that they have the right to do this. We not even have a job. And when those things happen, we look

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:28.040
for charismatic people. Even if they're not charismatic the way we like our friends to be

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:34.200
charismatic. Even if they're the leader version of charismatic people who maybe say the things that

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.240
we don't want to say to our daughters at the dinner table because we know they'll make us feel

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:46.440
stupid or angry or hateful. We want someone to just say it really loud so that agreeing with them

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:53.160
can be as easy as saying nothing at all. And then all the countries start doing that. We do it over

01:22:53.160 --> 01:23:00.760
here. We do it over there. Europe, it's concentrated in that landlocked portion. These people that

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:06.920
when we walked away from World War One and entered all of our depressions, we let them,

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:14.200
you know, foot the bill because they were to blame. So they stockpiled more weaponry because

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:20.120
you can convert your entire economy into a perceivable profit if you just say, well, fuck our

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:28.600
dollar. Let's just say your job is to make a tank. And I'll buy it. I'm your country. Yay,

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:35.880
we're Enron. So you're just making more tanks. And, you know, there's treaties you agreed to that

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:40.440
said you wouldn't do that, but everybody's got their own problems and everybody's isolationist

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:46.920
and everybody's nationalist. So what voting part of the public is going to go? Yes, I agree, Senator.

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:52.200
I think we should spend our time monitoring Germany and making sure they don't do things.

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:58.520
We should definitely pay a lot of attention to that huge threat that is that weird guy with that

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:04.840
weird haircut who is threatening everyone and saying that he deserves to be on the global stage.

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.120
You know, you're going to get a lot more sympathy going. Fuck that. Who cares? Even

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:15.080
maybe some people go, you know what? I like the cut of that guy's jib. He's making the trains run on

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:23.640
time. Fuck you, Senator. You're not reelected. And so it's like a system that just slides and

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:28.200
slides and slides and it lasts years and years and years and it isn't the pendulum that swings.

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:36.440
It's not like a sine wave. It's a linear ramp that just mounts like the flu. It just keeps going

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:43.240
and going. All the countries keep sealing up and stockpiling and mistrusting. And then they

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:48.920
start the frenzied alliances. Oh, I'm friends with this person because the enemy of the enemy

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:54.440
is my friend. Who's to say that this murderer isn't cooler than you? At least their clock

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:59.160
is bigger. At least their missiles are stronger. I like them. I like you too. Let's take pictures

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:03.880
together. Oh, I love it. Oh, no, I hate you. I'm going to go to war with you. Just kidding.

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:10.280
There is no truth. What's the truth? Who gives a fuck? As long as the poor people aren't

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:17.560
storming our castles and hanging us in the marketplace, who cares? So the stockpiles

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:24.600
continue to stockpile. And then there's an incident. Something happens. In World War I,

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:34.040
it was whatever his name was, Duke Ferdinand, Archduke Bishop Pontofoot. Little Lord Fontalroy

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:40.280
was murdered. But, you know, I was only supposed to talk about the thirties and the thirties are

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:49.400
simply just, you know, there's this kooky guy in the in the in the Europe who no one has the energy

01:25:49.400 --> 01:26:04.520
or the international feateness to bother to police starts, you know, saying, well, maybe we should

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:09.240
be here. Maybe we should be there. Maybe the whole problem is that we've been denied our natural right

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:15.560
to be everywhere. And so you don't argue with them and you let them annex and you let them do stuff.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:21.160
And meanwhile in the cities where it's happening, where there are no cameras, people are being

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:30.040
categorized, sorted. If you say this, then you're that. That makes you this. The media,

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:39.160
very simply just it's either state run or it's fake news. It's just something that isn't supposed

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:44.920
to be paid attention to back then. It was as easy as taking a Molotov cocktail going into the local

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.880
printing press and kicking it over, buying it, stealing it, beating up the guy that ran it.

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:56.120
But the bottom line is you take control of the media. You control the truth.

01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:02.360
Everybody that lives within each boundary, they only know one thing, which is that everybody's

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:10.840
out to get them. And then they know pride. They know uniforms. They know parades, colors, speeches,

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:17.960
amazing, simple things. Like, oh my God, it's been so complicated. I'm so tired of being embarrassed

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:23.880
at parties. So tired of being told I'm thisophobic and thatophobic. And then I owe this person this,

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:29.800
even though I barely have that. God, what if it was the truth? What if the truth was so simple?

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:35.640
What if it was just that everybody that doesn't look like me and wasn't born exactly where I was

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:41.240
born is a piece of shit out to get me and they just need to be rounded up and sequestered.

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:46.440
I'm not going to do anything bad to them. I don't wish any harm on them. I just want them out of

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:52.600
my fucking business, out of my face, out of my restaurant. I don't want them in my cabinets

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:58.280
or in my parliaments. Why can't they take care of themselves? What's the big fucking deal?

01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:04.040
Everybody just is out for themselves. I just want simplicity. That's all anyone wants.

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:08.360
If I see a cookie on a plate and I don't eat it, I'm going to come back and it's going to be eaten.

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:13.320
I'm going to eat it now. And the guy stands on a balcony and he says, this is what I'm talking about.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:20.120
Like, if you trace everything back, we invented it all. We're the fucking kings and we have been

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:25.960
denied this. There was a golden age. Don't pin me down on it. I'm not a historian or anything. I'm

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:32.520
just a orator. I'll just tell you over and over again. Back then, there was this simple time.

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:37.240
You know what I'm talking about? You were 10 years old once. Didn't it feel simpler then?

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:43.400
Didn't it feel like there was truth and falseness? Why is it so complicated now? What's with the

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:49.400
earrings and the tattoos and the biracals and the transimitans? What's with all this Facebook

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:54.680
business? Fuck this. I want to say Merry Christmas. I'm going to say Merry Christmas all the day.

01:28:54.680 --> 01:29:02.040
And you cheer and you chant and you parade and the missiles just keep piling up. And then eventually,

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:06.040
you know, we get to 1939.

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:19.160
And the guy that's never been told no is only going to do one thing. It's not going to be to

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:25.160
take a time out. He's tried everything he could fucking do. I tell you, like, he still hasn't

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.480
been told no. He still hasn't been challenged, not by his own people, not by anybody on the global

01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:36.440
stage. So you start going big. You do one big thing. And then we see how people respond.

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:43.720
And I think that is that a Polish thing? Is that the invasion of Poland? Maybe the Blitzkrieg.

01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:51.480
The Blitzkrieg. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So I take it from your not interrupting me that I kind

01:29:51.480 --> 01:30:01.880
of nailed it. Okay. All right. Isabel, you want to give him a grade on that? Be brutal. Be brutal.

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:08.680
A hundred? A hundred? Jesus. I mean, I don't think he used enough specifics. Out of a thousand.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:11.960
There's a lot of dates in history. Was there really a lot of piercings and tattoos going

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:16.040
on in Berlin? And you know, the only way to follow that is with Sports Corner.

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:25.240
World Cup edition. Dan Harmon's going to break down the World Cup standings for you right now.

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.960
Had a big day in the World Cup, but Dan Harmon's going to give you all the

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.080
today's highlights and see what we've got coming up on the knockout stage.

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:42.840
Well, America has been seized as they are every time this period with FIFA madness.

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:55.400
The Federal International Football Association is on fire. This is a global sport. Every country's

01:30:55.400 --> 01:31:01.160
got a team. And right now we're at the World Cup time World Cup. I mean, it's sort of the

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:06.920
it's sort of the World Series of soccer. How do you feel about USA's chances going forward?

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:15.000
You know, I mean, USA, I'm taking them out. You know, like, I don't think we should even

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.200
consider them in the running. I mean, that's right, because they're not they're not in the

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:23.000
running. They didn't even make it in. This is a European sport. Yeah. But you know, Italy is

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:29.480
always a powerhouse. Of course, the blues, the blues. Yeah. Yeah. He told me that at the bar.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:38.760
They're called the blues. Yeah, well, I mean, look, I, I, speaking of you and me talking

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:44.920
football at the bar today, you, you were up in a lather. You were in a veritable lather about the

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:49.880
whole video assisted replay thing. Now they can go back and look at penalties and look at off

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:56.120
science calls. Right. Where do you fall on that, Dan? Oh, you know, soccer used to be about the

01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:05.960
yardage, the yardage. And now you can make a CG line on the field and you can know exactly when

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:15.960
Lewis Suarez is biting someone. So I guess I'm for it. I like I think there should be more

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:20.120
accountability. There's a lot of drama out in that field, people faking injuries and rolling

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:26.680
around. There was one thing when an Austria, I'm serious now, I read today when the Swiss team,

01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:33.000
what the fuck? When the Swiss team beat the Serbians, there's two Swiss players who are of

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:39.800
Albanian like ethnic descent who are from Kosovo. I mean, the Swiss are going to perform exactly

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:49.560
the same way every year, like clockwork. It's what they do. Yeah. I think, I think, I don't

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:52.760
even think they care about soccer. I think they use it as an opportunity to do meta promotion for

01:32:52.760 --> 01:33:05.160
their clocks. Sports Corner. All right. Isabel, you're going to give a college in mind or is that

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:13.960
too early to say? I don't have a college in mind yet. And I haven't started really looking. Yeah,

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:21.480
you shouldn't. You don't actually start looking. I remember there were a lot of, when I was in

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:26.440
11th grade, it started with the, you got to write a letter to your college. There was like a lot of,

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:32.840
there was so much pressure on the college thing that it really kind of like, I think it's why I

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:38.120
dropped out immediately. So I think it's good that you take it like, you just like, so that you know

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:41.880
the day you wake up and go to college, you're choosing to go to college because there was so

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:47.720
much from the age of 15 for me. I didn't even, college was like some religion. It was like not

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:52.840
a real thing. I kept thinking it was this thing that happened after high school where I would,

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:57.720
and I was basing it on like John Hughes movies and things and going like, oh, I'm going to then cut

01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:03.720
classes and party and be like an adult or like paper chase. I'm going to have arguments with a

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:09.240
professor and then I went and I was like, I don't want to be at college and I dropped out. So I mean,

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:13.960
I think it's better that you're not under so much pressure that you can like look at it like a thing

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:30.280
you want to do. It's the worst podcast ever to listen to, right? I'm not fishing for anything.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:37.480
Me neither. That's good. Well, I mean, do you have anything to plug?

01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:44.360
Just adulthood, right? I'm going to be an adult soon.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.200
Look for that. What about your, what about your father's photography business?

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:59.320
J.F. Sheehan and photography. If anyone wants to just contact John Sheehan and

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:08.920
if he's not busy, he'll answer you. What's the name of the company again?

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:13.480
John F. Sheehan Photography. Dan, you want to do a little jingle so you can make like a

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:24.120
J.F. Sheehan Photography is a world of cameras true. They've got a wide selection and the camera's

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:32.360
just for you. John Sheehan will take the camera and point it at the stuff.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:42.440
Look through a hole in the back of it and that will be enough. J.J. Sheehan Photography is a

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:55.880
wonderful world of cameras. We owe Mike Gravello some money. Hopefully no one from Mike Gravello's

01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:01.160
photography will be listening to that. We might have taken some parts of their jingle

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:06.360
to the point where I accidentally advertised your father's photography service as a place where

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:10.360
you could buy cameras and then I kind of corrected it under the fly and said,

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:13.960
don't go, but he'll look through the hole on the other side. All right, let's give it a

01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:19.640
free Zabelle. Thank you. Thank you, Zabelle. What a wonderful... Thank you for allowing me on your show.

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:29.000
Good job. Zabelle, everybody. Oops, sorry. Don't give her a giant plushy pickle rick in her quiver.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.720
I don't even have... She's got a pickle rick quiver. She's got a pickle rick quiver.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:45.320
She's an Indian giver of life. She's got a pickle rick quiver. She hurts my liver. I drink

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:55.640
while I shiver. In life, when the freaks come out, they come out right. A pickle rick quiver

01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:04.600
is an Indian giver politically incorrect term. Give it away, take it back. I'm gonna have a

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:14.840
heart attack. I'm 71 years old. My name is Anthony. Oh, that's a good time to still be.

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:25.240
My name is Anthony. I came with my son, you see. I don't listen to your pack ass. You seem like a

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:31.240
blowhard ass. I just want to live another day. My dad turned 96 the other day. I'm trying to make

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:37.080
it that far. I can't wait to get to my car. I'm stealing the cheese in my pocket. You suck.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:53.080
Oh, shit. Oh, we got sexy lights. No. We have so much lighting in this sit-down

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:58.680
slow show. We only have a small bit left of the show. Should we play a little D&D to get things

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:07.160
going here? Anthony, you're gonna love this. Anthony, I want you to buckle your holy shit

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:12.600
belt because it's about to get fucking nerdy. If you thought the last 90 minutes was inaccessible.

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:22.600
Imagine a wheelchair ramp made of knives and puppy bones. Anthony, you got your Yankees cap

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:30.920
on there. You're a big Yankee fan. You wear it for the sale? It's more about East Coast

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:34.840
Rap than it is the actual football baseball. Are you more of a East Coast Rap style guy or

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:40.680
are you like the West Coast Rap? Anthony, you don't like rap? What do you like? What's your music?

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:49.480
Sixty's Folk? Yeah. Like Moody Blues? Or is it like genuine folk? Like, as soon as Bob Dylan

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:55.720
steps in, you're like, this is starting to sell out a little bit. Jimmy Hendrix. He's my favorite

01:38:55.720 --> 01:39:04.920
folk singer. What do you think? I thought he got out of the army. I thought he pretended to be gay

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:23.000
to get out of the army. His leg was gay though, right? Gay for combat. That's what I would use

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.560
reverse psychology. If I was in a draft, I'd go to the army and I'd say, listen, I want to fight so

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:36.200
bad. My leg is gay for the army. I can't wait to get out there and fight. But then one of my legs

01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:41.720
is just regular. So I don't know what to do. I don't know if you want me running in circles,

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.640
but you know, I probably should just stay home.

01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:54.520
Just not a coward, but I shouldn't fight in a war. But then in that movie, there would be a smash

01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:59.320
wipe to you with a shaved head and a full military fatigue zone and a gun. And one of my legs cut

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:09.000
off. Whether or not a bomb strapped to my being dropped out the Bombay doors. What do you think

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.280
of Bob Dylan, Anthony, as a folk guy? Because he seems like a polarizing figure. Do you like

01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:22.840
Bob Dylan? Do you respect him? Okay. Pretty simple stuff. He said yes. There are some people out

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:30.440
there that are like, oh, he was more of an assimilator. I don't believe you. You're a liar.

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:38.040
He absorbed all of the people, but it's like, yeah. Do you like Joni Mitchell, Anthony?

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:43.960
She was entertaining. Okay, that was a soft response to that one.

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:51.080
There's a lot more said in the silence of that answer. All right, let's pass down Dan. Let's do

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:54.680
a little fireman lining and pass down the folders here for our characters. Let's bring up Steve

01:40:54.680 --> 01:41:06.120
Levy so we can play some proper D&D. D&D is a lot like folk music. Yeah, there's a Dungeon Master

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:13.080
and Garfunkel. The Dungeon Master is like the Woody Guthrie. Hi, Rob. Hello, Steve. How you doing?

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:20.760
I have your wallet. Oh, you just kept bringing him stuff. Yeah. Did he ask you for that? Yeah.

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:25.480
Oh, my phone was going off and you were worried that something bad was like important. Yeah.

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:29.880
All right. It was just Kate. I was born down the road from here. Did you know that? You were

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:41.000
what? Oh, yeah. Born down the road. Steve is a Long Island baby. I mean, like he's an island baby

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.520
who is way too long. What were you guys talking about? All right, especially we don't have loads

01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:51.400
of times. Let's dive right in. Are you ready for one? Do we not? Huh? Do we not? How much time do

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:58.920
we got? We got 20 minutes. Great. That's awesome. All right. Or 30 trillion years, depending on which

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:04.120
metric you want to use. Yeah. And the fact that these people are sitting higher than we are,

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:08.280
time is traveling at a different race. Yeah, they don't realize it. They get a little more

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:14.520
show than the people down here do. Yes. Anthony is perceiving the slowest show of his life.

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:18.280
He will be 71 when he gets out of here.

01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:24.760
When he came here, he and his father were the same age.

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.560
When he visits his father, he will be 96 years old. Where have you been? I've been traveling.

01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:34.520
I was in a podcast traveling at the speed of boredom.

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:39.960
You remember that thing they would show that in public? You know, that idea that if you travel at

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:46.200
the speed of light and then you're your twin brother and you come, yeah. Time cop? What's up?

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:50.920
Yeah. Time copping again? No, no. It's just more like when I was a kid, PBS shows explaining

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:55.240
relativity. It would use it to like with these kind of like time traveling scenarios where an

01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:58.520
astronaut would go up and travel at the speed of light and come back home. Can we show the clip?

01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:03.880
What was that movie? There's that movie where the kid goes into the spaceship and the spaceship has

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:09.720
like an eyeball in it. Flight of the Navigator. Yeah. I don't think it was that, but okay. That sounds

01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:13.800
like exactly what it was. Paul Reumann's voice, the spaceship. I guess. All right, Spenser. No,

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.760
I don't think it was that. I think I'm thinking of something else. Flight of the Navigator.

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:22.920
I don't think so. Yeah. I don't think so. Are you trying to get punched? Yeah. No, you're in a

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:29.080
planned area at a comic book convention saying what was the name of this movie with the eyeball

01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:34.440
in the spaceship? They're shouting Flight of the Navigator and you're just provoking them. Yeah. Also,

01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:40.280
we are at a tactical disadvantage. They're all above us. All they have to do is take one step

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:46.280
forward and they will, it'll be like World War Z. Like they'll just be in Tel Aviv, like on top of us.

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:55.960
Yeah. Yes, you do. I mean, fight me. I swear to God, I landed on this fucking plane. The second

01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:01.960
the plane touched down, I was furious. I was like, God fucking damn it. We got off the plane. We went

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:07.720
to the bathroom. I start ripping a goddamn toilet dispenser off the wall or the toilet paper dispenser.

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:12.200
I'm like, I'm pulling it off the wall. Like, why isn't it coming off the wall? And then I'm like,

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:16.600
what are you doing? It's because of that urine color. No, it's because of New York. Fuck this place.

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:24.360
Okay. Yeah, I don't give a shit. Okay. All right. There's a guy right there that responded

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:29.880
like that. But for all we know, that's New York for like, yeah, like welcome to the party. Like,

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:35.560
it's solidarity. We can't tell no, you're shaking your head. No, that's how you're one of those

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:40.280
rare people that's proud of New York. You think that it's the greatest city in the world. I know.

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:46.440
I know it's a it's a it's not a brave stance. You know, it is fucking Connecticut.

01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:54.840
Is that all right? Okay. I just pulled that at a random. Well, that's like, I mean,

01:44:54.840 --> 01:45:02.200
that's the worst state, right? What? Florida. Oh, come on. Something wrong with Jersey.

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:10.200
Yeah, Rhode Island. Rhode Island. Fuck you, Rhode Island. Did you guys pay an ounce of attention

01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:18.360
to my history lesson? Here you go again. All right, Spencer, brief recap.

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:25.560
Last time on Harmontown yesterday. Yeah, you guys didn't hear any of this.

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:33.240
What happened? Oh, Jesus. You guys, you, you found Patchen's gem.

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:42.920
But you lost Patchen's. I was, I was writing. This is my turn. Okay. I was trying to help.

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:48.680
There's a fire in town that was happening because you guys started a fire in town to,

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:54.280
to escape and distract them from you guys trying to kidnap one of the most important figures of

01:45:54.280 --> 01:46:00.440
town. So the fire was happening and you guys were missing Patchen's, but you had Patchen's gem,

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:06.360
which you had gotten to give back to Patchen's. So you look for Patchen's in the town that was on

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:11.160
fire, but being on fire, you got distracted by the fire and started fighting the fire.

01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:15.480
Well, kind of you were looking for Patchen's while everyone else was fighting a fire and you

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.600
didn't want to be distracting. So you're like, let's pretend we're fighting a fire while we're

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:24.600
interrogating the city. Great place to look for Patchen's is at the town fire. It's his time.

01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:32.760
It's his time. Yeah. He likes me. I like every putting, except New York. Yeah, I don't like

01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:39.240
New York. Yeah, no, I'm not saying that to be popular. Fuck Connecticut. All right, let's go back and

01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:45.800
try. Well, what happened afterwards? We put the fire out. Right. That was it. No, you put the fire

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:50.200
out. We put the magical fire thing. We put the fire out. You put the fire out. I was writing the

01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:56.680
bear with them. I was writing the bear. I got Garry Shandling myself got on top of Bearney Mac

01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:03.240
because I had a magic purse with water symbols on it. And I was I was we were I was writing the bear

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:12.360
around a burning building going Oh, and and and and quite successfully putting out a lot of the

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:17.160
fires. Right. I said you put out the fire, but you didn't say who and you didn't say how. Right.

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:23.800
That's a recap. What do you think, Anthony? It tracks, right? Okay. All right. Anthony seems

01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:30.120
happy. He gets it. Yeah. Anthony, what do you do for a living? What do you do for a living?

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:41.240
You build microwave parts that go on satellites and military missiles. I don't think you're supposed

01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:47.240
to tell people. And some of your stuff is on display here at the at the cradle. Oh, really? Wow. Okay.

01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:58.200
I'm kind of embarrassed that we're up here. And he's he's like, yeah, I come here every week.

01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:06.360
I see a lot of respected speakers. Do you own own the building?

01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:12.520
Yeah. Okay. So you see, you're you're an engineer, then. No.

01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:22.920
Engineering assistant. Fantastic. Oh, yeah, in the army. Fantastic. Let's give it up for Anthony.

01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:34.440
So now, Anthony, a a basically a hedge. He's a shambling mound of weeds road on top of a talking

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:41.720
bear. This will explain everything. Put out of put out of fire. And it's okay. So hey villagers,

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:47.880
I think you noticed that we we atone for our sins. No, you didn't. You're welcome. You're

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:53.640
welcome. You're welcome. Spencer, how does the crowd receive our feet? They look like an angry mob.

01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.640
Even though that we helped put out the fire, the fire you started after kidnapping the town mayor.

01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:04.760
Sometimes you have to start a fire to put it out.

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:14.520
Here here. Oh, give him a break. Look at that guy. Wait, the mayor was the head of the theater.

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:20.760
Yeah, you guys didn't ask. But yeah, true. Shrove. He was the mayor. Yeah, I thought he was the head

01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:26.760
of the theater company. Didn't we beat him up in my living room? Yeah. Oh, yikes. Are we

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:33.560
saying this out loud? Is he still in my living room? No. Is he alive? You don't know. But he

01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:39.960
probably is. He escaped. Are we saying this out loud in front of the angry mob? Yeah,

01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:47.880
they're just watching you. Oh, okay. There has been a regime change in your town. You have lost

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:53.800
your way. Politics ran rampant and became the new religion. Now religion will recalibrate.

01:49:53.800 --> 01:50:00.280
We love Shrove, but he got a little full of himself. Admit it, Kevin.

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:08.120
I talked to Darlene, a plumber. She said that Shrove wouldn't let her have a part-time job

01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:17.240
and feed her family. I talked to a nurse that said she has to work part-time as a webcam girl.

01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:28.360
Just to make buckets. This isn't working. No, it's not. It's anachronistic and it's

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:39.880
uncharismatic. Run? Run. What if we have this gem? We have something valuable. All the better

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:46.680
reason to run. I give it one last chance. I go, listen, everybody, if someone doesn't

01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:53.320
tell me right now where Patchens is, it's going to be hell to pay. We're going to bring the

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:57.960
fucking thunder. He's going to relight the town on fire. Yeah, you've seen what we can do.

01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:05.320
Was there a question there? No, no. I say, tell me where somebody here,

01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:12.280
tell me where Patchens is. No one knows who that is. God damn it. Run, run, run.

01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:19.000
Yeah, he's probably running. Okay, I cast Fireball. That's something that's not on fire

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:24.360
and I light another thing on fire. Hold on. What spell? Produce Flame? Fireball.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.400
You can't cast Fireball. I can't? No. What the fuck? You're not like level seven.

01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:33.400
Okay, how about this? What about co-executive Produce Flame?

01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:41.080
Okay. He's got to have that, but now he's guys been working for years. I get all the merchandise.

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:48.200
Okay, I produce Flame. All right, you toss a few fire blobs. One of them lands in a dry field

01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:53.960
that hasn't been watered. You're going to deny this in your history books, but the truth is,

01:51:53.960 --> 01:52:00.360
you did this. Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run. We run.

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:07.800
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:13.640
I jump on Gary's back. Okay. Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo. You got to do the noise. Woo, woo, woo,

01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:19.160
woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:24.840
Most of the town resumes fighting the fire, but they don't even care.

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:32.040
No, most of the town. Three bulky looking, farmer looking dudes just tear ass after you,

01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:36.280
though. They're just chasing you. You make it out of the town and they're still chasing you.

01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:44.600
That was their mistake. I take my bow and I aim at them and I shoot them from Garry Shandling's back.

01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:48.760
Okay. Does anyone else want to do anything while you're running away?

01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:52.440
Well, what's our friend's name? Our overreactive friend who now doesn't...

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:56.600
Geffen. Geffen. Oh, Summon Geffen. He's crazy.

01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:02.040
Oh, no. So as you're running away, you hear the hoof beats returning and you hear the skulls

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:08.040
smashing of... Oh, my gosh....of Geffen. See, this is... I meant to mention this recap. Also,

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:12.040
while you were trying to convince everyone to stop the fire, Geffen from the church came

01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:18.040
and started murdering people and you kind of had to stop him. Right. But now he's back murdering

01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:23.640
people again. He's sort of the Agent Orange of our unwinnable war. Yeah. That's a great way to

01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:27.080
look at it. That doesn't give you flashbacks, Anthony. You're right. You're right. Oh, man.

01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:32.040
What should I do? Wow. Wow. I don't know. What if it did? All right. Well, if you...

01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:37.240
Hilarious. Keep going. Do I successfully hit one of the farmers?

01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:44.440
Were you in the shit, Anthony? You were? Okay. I feel bad. He said he was in the army.

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:47.960
Well, I didn't know that meant Vietnam automatically. Were you in Vietnam?

01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:57.640
1967, 1977. Oh, my God. Did you... Did you see actual combat? Were you...

01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:02.680
All right. I'm sorry. Oh, wow. That's so cool. He keeps getting cooler.

01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:09.800
This is insane. It's been two hours and he's only gotten cooler. All right. If my joke didn't

01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:22.520
traumatize you, nod your head. You... Fuck. I can't blame him. These people will turn on me.

01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:33.240
Have some empathy. I'm truly sorry if... He's gonna... He's gonna...

01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:38.600
I didn't mean to trivialize any personal experience that you had. Like, that would make me feel terrible.

01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:44.920
Just let it go. Oh, my God. Keep digging. No, I'm accountable and I fucking... I pivot.

01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:55.960
You're escaping the town. And DJ just fired up a boat, right? Yeah. You see DJ loose an arrow.

01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:02.920
It's hard to do because you're on the back of a biped running. Hell yeah. Yeah. All right. You miss.

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:08.920
Nice shot, though. Thanks. I'm just impressed. I was even able to get it off. Yeah. So,

01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:16.040
three guys, we can just turn and fight these guys. Hey, I'm Gary. What? I'm sorry. Yeah, we met.

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:22.040
We... I'm diarrhea. Okay. We never officially met. I'd be at my best if they were skeletons,

01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:29.320
but everyone is a skeleton deep down. I love that optimism.

01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:38.600
All right. Knowing that I'm not gonna be able to run faster than farmhands, I stop and face them.

01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:47.560
All right. Gentlemen, the wrath of God is not something we walk away from.

01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:52.200
All right. One of them stabs you in the chest with a pitchfork.

01:55:52.200 --> 01:56:02.440
You're wearing armor, though, so you take five damage. Carlos, no.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.840
Gary, turn around. We got to go back and help our friend. Hold on. Let me make a Y turn here.

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:13.320
Oh, that's true. You're doing a stop top. All right. Well, did Jeff stop too, right?

01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:19.800
Yeah. Okay. So too. I summon nature's ally.

01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:24.600
Okay. I think you're out of that. Where's Barney Mack in all this? He's here.

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:30.440
I feel like I must be out of every spell. Yeah. Okay. I just go old school. Can I do

01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:35.640
Shalely? Or am I out of spells right now? I think you... What level of spell is Shalely?

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:42.120
Shalely is... Sorry, everybody. Is it level one? It better be. Yeah, it is. Level one.

01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:46.840
Then you have... That's your last spell left if I'm... Okay. I go Shalely and I just go full

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:53.720
on Noam Druid Shalely attack. All right. You cast Shalely and it makes your staff turn into a Shalely.

01:56:53.720 --> 01:57:02.040
That's what she said. That's certainly a level one spell. That's like casting hammer on a nail.

01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:07.320
I was just like, well, or I could go to a hardware store. It gives it more damage.

01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:15.160
So I attack the nearest foe. Ah, you got to cast it first. So that was your turn just casting it.

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:20.200
Of what? That's magic, bro. You got to plan ahead. All right. I'm standing there with a

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:28.520
half cast Shalely. No, it's fully cast. Okay. So I enjoy some lemonade. It's great.

01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:38.440
Schrab. I use one of my feet. I cleave at the closest one. I cleave them. All right.

01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:45.160
Good shambling mound cleave. Swinging a mighty haymaker. You smash the guy in the face, but it's

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:54.760
not enough to kill him. So it doesn't cleave. Does he... He takes 14 damage. Yeah. I'll take it.

01:57:55.960 --> 01:58:03.720
He drops to his knees like stunned and dazed. He's like a dizzy. It didn't have to be like this.

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:08.040
The other two round to round with their weapons. They're just kind of knives like kitchen knives,

01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:12.680
not even like daggers. And they start attacking at you guys, but a little sad, isn't it? Yeah,

01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:17.720
it is. That's what you notice. I want to write a letter home to my grandma. I think we're the

01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:23.720
bad guys who the real enemy is. All right. Somebody says something witty because the show is basically

01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:32.120
over. You get stabbed in the face. Oh, that wasn't witty enough. Or I've burned through all my

01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:40.360
credibility with the audience. I can't tell. Can I morning star one of these fellows? Oh, yeah.

01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:49.720
The guy is still dazed from the impact from the shambling mound and you find it very easy to drive

01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:55.960
your morning star into his head. This just feels so... Why are you... You know you have free will.

01:58:56.760 --> 01:59:01.880
You're choosing these actions. The choice is between getting stabbed with a butcher knife

01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:07.560
or killing a farmer whose weapon is a butcher knife. Those are two choices. It's a purek victory

01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:15.080
or an actual death. I open up my glass jar of Dracula ash. Relatively blunt weapon.

01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:25.000
Yeah, you open it. Okay. I open up my glass jar of Dracula ash and I just start throwing it in the

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:32.280
air like confetti and going, yeah, we're doing it. We're doing it. All right. It's great. Everyone

01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:40.360
starts coughing. Cliffhanger. Thank you so much, everybody. All right. Thank you for coming out

01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:47.320
of CradleCon at the Cradle of Aviation Museum. Thank you, Anthony Jr. and Anthony III.

01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:50.520
Thank you to Isabel for coming down there and helping us out.

01:59:50.520 --> 02:00:00.120
You guys were wonderful. It's been a long day and it culminated in a wonderful intimate little

02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:03.400
spaulding gray show. I loved it. Thank you to Rob on Sound. Down here we're getting

02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:12.360
splashed by the entrance of Rob Schrab, everybody. Steve Levy. Spencer Crittenden.

02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:18.280
I'm Jeff Davis of Comptroller. Your mayor is Dan Harmon. Give it up for Dan Harmon, everybody.

02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:28.280
Thank you so much, y'all. Drive fast and take chances.

02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:46.280
Did you get any of that?
